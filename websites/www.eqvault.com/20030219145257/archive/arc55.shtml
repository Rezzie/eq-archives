Alan again hit the class threads hard today on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-3.html"><b>Monk Talk, Part 3</b></a><br>NyogTha wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This post was meant to show you that it is possible to twink and cheat this quest which I KNOW was not meant to be done via the Verant design team.]</i></font> <br><br>No worry, that's how I understood it too. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: SOLUTION: <br>Make all sashes/headbands NO DROP<br>Take the robe off of Brother Zephyl/Brother Qwinn<br>Do not allow for multi-questing either robe<br>Have Kaiaren hand the quester a container and have the the fang and Book of the Celestial Fists be combined and handed back into Kaiaren in order to receive the epic.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Though these ideas do have merit, they will, as you say, over power the class too much. Warriors get stun at 55 so why should we get it at 5?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, my thought was that at, say, 50th level, one of the skills you gain at 5th might get a new bonus, like stun or something. Same damage level, making it only really useful for it's special power. A way to give a monk a special skill without linking it to a higher level skill (making that skill too powerful), and giving it the limitation of much reduced damage. <br><br>This was only a thought, as I am not really convinced that monks really need any new skills. They have a pretty solid selection as it is. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: OK, the idea to fix Thunderkick is wonderful. It is easily taken care of with the use of a MINIMUM damage level. That is already on your list of things to address and we thank you. <br><br>STUN on T-Kick is a bad idea. We already get a discipline at 60 that allows us to stun called "Silent Fist". Please do not add this to T-Kick.]</i></font> <br><br>Got it. Obviously I haven't had time to familiarize myself with all of the skills that a monk gets. I was sorta relying on you guys to help me out there. Once I have these lists of ideas, though, I am going to give them all a reality check. I suspect that the stun on Thunderkick idea would have been tossed out when I got up to speed and discovered that it was an ability that monks already got at 60th level. Obviously it's possible to give a stun earlier, but probably not warranted. Thanks for the heads up. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This would probably be the best method of doing so. Please weigh both of these ideas.]</i></font> <br><br>We will. I think these might be the best two idea for raising monk damage a bit. But, again, let me clarify that I am not convinced this is needed. We'll have to decide if the class needs more damage post 50 before we even look at these. But I don't think either of these ideas is easier (linked special attacks and unlinking foot/hand attacks) than the other from a programming standpoint. I don't know for sure, but they sound like they might actually both be fairly easy to do (I can hear the programmers screaming now, I can see them lighting torches&#8230;) <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But giving us the ability to just "push back" the caster with our specials is EXACTLY what we need.]</i></font> <br><br>Fair enough. And maybe not with all of the attacks. Perhaps all past a certain level, or all kicks&#8230; something like that. A good idea, though, and easier to suggest than a stun. <br><br>Neou_the_Cyber_Monk wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think Absor leaves today to Baltimore so no more hearing from him anymore. ]</i></font> <br><br>Tomorrow morning, actually. So this will be the last you hear from me for a while.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-2.html"><b>Warrior Talk, Part 3</b></a><br>First, a few of my observations about warriors (you need to know this so that you can correct me where I'm wrong). As the 'base' class that other combat classes are built around, it should be very hard to find anything that is in need of change for the warrior. I'm reading things like more hit points&#8230; no. If we change warrior hit points, then we have to change all the other classes hit points, since the basis for hit points, at least on tanks, is the warrior&#8230; <br><br>I really don't expect to find too many things that need to be changed about warriors. <br><br>Also, I actually hope to see as many suggestions for 'nerfs' as for improvements. Keep in mind that the warrior is pretty much the base class, so it is very unlikely that we will be improving something that has any major effect unless it addresses some deficiency. If not, then this might actually be one of those cases where we need to do a sort of give and take. I guess I'm saying that by their very nature, warriors just about have to be balanced, and an improvement to them might necessarily require a change to all other fighting classes to match them. And that's not really what I'm looking for. <br><br>And, well, just like every other class, I want to warn you that a close examination like this brings the possibility that we will see something that needs to be nerfed. For example, I really don't like the idea that warriors have so many spells available to them through items, especially things like invisibility. I intend to ask that these things be looked at. My suspicion is that they won't be removed, we don't like to do that. But as a matter of class balance, I think it should be looked at. <br><br>My most powerful D&D character, by far, is a warrior. He's not powerful because he fights really well, though that's part of it. He's powerful because he has a lot of items that allow him to act like a caster. He isn't that high level, but he is more wanted in groups than my higher level characters. He's obnoxious, too, so it's not because of his personality&#8230; <br><br>Anyway, don't be too surprised if I don't pick a lot of suggestions from your lists. There might not be too much that needs changing. <br><br>Filo wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Another nice addition would be the addition of an "AE Taunt." In multi-MOB situations it would be nice if the warrior had a skill that would attract the attentions of more than one mob in the vicinity. Of course, this skill would have it's own drawbacks . . . be careful what you wish for.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, that's not such a bad idea. It has it's own drawbacks built right in. :)  I'm even willing to suggest a version of this that might allow the warrior to attack all creatures in the area (one swing). But it would have to be very high level and very limited in re-use. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Another area where Warriors seem to be a little lacking is in the AC and HP department. I am not suggesting that a huge move is needed in either of these areas, but in the high level game, there is precious little difference between a warriors AC and HP versus the hybrids and melee "wizards" (Rogues and Monks) ]</i></font> <br><br>That's exactly the opposite of what the hybrids, monks and rogues say&#8230; A lot of them think that there is too wide of a gap between their hit points and/or armor class and that of a warrior, and they want more. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is further compounded by the relative difficulty of the warrior epic as compared to the others. Why the double whammy?]</i></font> <br><br>I don't know&#8230; I really don't think that the warrior epic is relatively harder than most. It seems to be pretty middle of the road, to me. But I'll add it to the list (along with the request that we give it haste). <br><br>Aanya said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Other classes getting to close to warriors <br>I believe that warriors should be able to tank better than Paladins and Shadow Knights. I see that you "noted" those classes wishes for higher hp, better defensive skills, higher offansive skills etc etc. What they asked for, was for you to make their tanking ability close to the warriors. Our tanking ability vs most normal mobs is fine (except for taunt), but if you increase the tanking ability of the SK and Paladin, keep in mind that there would be no real reason to play a warrior at all. Why play a warrior without spells when you can play a warrior with spells.]</i></font> <br><br>We will keep that in mind. Remember, the warrior is the basis from which their skills and such are balanced. <br><br>evilsofa said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I've been watching the SK talk, and part of the problem there is that an improvement of the SK's defense (and, I'm sure, the Paladin's, when their talk begins) would be an intrusion on the Warrior's role as the ultimate defense. One way to give the SK and Paladin some wiggle room to improve their defense would be to improve the Warrior's defense in tandem.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, even if knights had exactly the same armor class and defensive skills as a warrior, they would be worse tanks, since they have noticeably fewer hit points. As I said earlier, improving warriors would almost by default mean an improvement in those other classes, so that the gap would not close. If we choose to close the gap, then warriors will have to remain where they are. I'm certainly not going to advocate an increase in warrior power _just_ so we can give more power to the hybrids. That seems sorta backward to me. <br><br>ErikTorvald wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: BIND WOUNDS.... <br>Please allow the percentage healed to increase with level. Start at 50 and by 20 let the tank be at 70% then at 30, 80% then 40 at 90% then at 50 at 100%. Do you really think it will effect balance? Heck no.. I will still be screaming for a clearic. The bind wound is nothing more for the times when you have no cleric, druid, shaman, or necro handy.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, I'm not one to advocate something that is specifically intended to improve the solo ability of any class. But I'll add it. <br><br>JazyaVechette wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. (More of a general thing) 2h weapons not only do less damage overall, but taunt is laughable. <br>Solution: Warrior hits from 2h Weapons generate 3x the 'taunt' factor of similar 1h damage.]</i></font> <br><br>Interesting idea. <br><br>Banzai wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: *********************<br>&#8220;FURIOUS (Level 56):<br>When using this discipline, the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed on him by the opponent he is facing.

At lvl 59 I&#8217;m basically invincible for 9 seconds AND I can repost but at lvl 59 I&#8217;m only invincible for 8 seconds and have to wait LONGER? Ummmm, what? I&#8217;m surprised no one has brought this up as lvl 59 is surprisingly lame. Especially since if you are running for zone and hit this you most likely will be summoned anyway so really, why bother? My take would be to refresh each at 15 min and swap them in lvl order or get rid of the lvl 59 one and give us something else.]</i></font> <br><br>That does seem odd. So, Riposte prevents the attack from hitting AND does a return attack&#8230; Ok, this is on the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is FALSE of broken.

But that is not the case. ]</i></font> <br><br>Hehe, no, I don't read it as meaning that your damage will increase progressively. It isn't broken. The description could be reworded, perhaps, but it's not broken. <br><br>DurgoECI wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Cobalt Helm and Bracer -- Again, ditto what everyone else has said about the drop rates.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not really looking for this kind of thing, but I'll add it to the list. <br><br>Thrakki wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What I propose, aside from the usual epic, cobalt drop increase, taunt increase, hp, ac, yada yada suggestions is an upgrade to how critical hits work.

C'mon, it's a CRITICAL hit...it should do no less than at least 1 point higher than your normal max damage hit. ]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not sure that I agree with your logic. I see a critical as a chance to do a lot of damage, not a certainty of doing max damage. But I'll add it to the list. <br><br>gregory2000 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I love the warrior class.

I gather that the idea is to have 'berserk' as a skill (or discipline) like taunt. It would have to have a long timer, perhaps on the same scale as Lay on Hands. I'll add it to the list and see if it floats (or something like that). If it seems too powerful, perhaps we can replace one of the high level disciplines with this one. <br><br>Trana said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So please add some Iksar (race only) armor to a plane so we have alittle better chance of getting somthing.]</i></font> <br><br>I'll add it to the list. <br><br>Mongo Baroogar scribbled: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As has been mentioned (Remf covered it specifically in terms of the greenie horde, and others mentioned related ideas), I would propose an inherent 'respect' effect.

Tdir informed me of the following events:<BLOCKQUOTE>Lanys T'Vyl appeared in Rathe Mountains tonight, seeking one of her children to lead her to Oggok to find the evil shaman who gave her a flawed spell.  Trytiin led her there.  Once she made it to the city she was greeted by myself, Tdir, and other believes of the dark, to protect and escort the Lady of Hate.  We entered the town and explored, she looked for an ogre to lead her about the town.  We traveled in she pointed out various spots of good places to hold if Oggok was ever under attack. She also hinted to a plan of battle soon by either Firiona Vie and her followers or a possible civil war in the Tier'Dal.  She believes her King doesn't have trust and faith in her to win the war between good and hate.  So she told us true followers of hate to prepare for war.  She is waiting for the next move to be made then she will show herself again.  We heard the shaman running about in the town trying to get away.  He hid himself as a guard, that was a mistake.  She caught on and slayed the dumb ogre.   On our way to his known presense, the Daughter of Innoruuk attacked a Paladin who was attempting to kill one of the ogre guards.  He ran with his tail between his legs out of town.   Yet he came back and taunted her, she quickly summoned him and taught him a lesson.  She also decided that the Priest of Discord was a joke and quickly killed him aswell.  I shall wait for my lady to appear again, and prepare for war, the evil shall win.<br> <br>Tdir Storm'Infinity<br>Shadow Knight of Innoruuk<br>Leader of <a href="www.planet-infinite.net">Clan Infinite</a><br>Terris-Thule Server<br> <br><LI><a href="http://claninfinite.virtualave.net/images/gm1.jpg">Screenshot1</a><br><LI><a href="http://claninfinite.virtualave.net/images/gm2.jpg">Screenshot2</a><br><LI><a href="http://claninfinite.virtualave.net/images/gm3.jpg">Screenshot3</a><br><LI><a href="http://claninfinite.virtualave.net/images/gm4.jpg">Screenshot4</a><br><LI><a href="http://claninfinite.virtualave.net/images/gm5.jpg">Screenshot5</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

Here are the latest Absor Infobits straight off of the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-3.html"><b>Monk Talk, Part 2</b></a><br>NeoTwilight wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Raise damage output by 10 to 15%. That would put monks nicely between Warriors and Rogues.]</i></font> <br><br>The question here is, are monks supposed to do more damage than warriors and less than rogues. I don't know, really. <br><br>THE_FNORD said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Give us triple attack]</i></font>  <br><br>I'll assume that this might be one method of placing the monks damage output between warrior and rogues. <br><br>B_O_B said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: At 50 monks fists are 14/29<br>At 60 monks fists are 14/26 ( i think)<br>Make it so fists become 17/26 so they can keep up with rogues.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok. I'll add something like this to the list. Keep in mind, though, that I'm not a ratio person, and someone with more understanding of this will look at it. <br><br>THE_FNORD wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Make one or all of our special attacks stun.]</i></font> <br><br>I've now seen three requests from you on the first page. All one liners with no reasoning behind them. I'm going to have to leave such requests off the list. This isn't like the list of gifts young kids send to Santa every year. I need to know why these things should be done as a matter of balance. <br><br>DrewD wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Too much armor and weapons for monks. Their "defining characteristic" was supposed to be unarmed combat, plus a refreshing indifference to loot since they had nothing to buy and couldn't carry it anyway. That all went out the window when items starting being used as kludges to increase the power of monks without really increasing the power of monks. Just go ahead and increase the power of monks directly. If you want it rare, implement some interesting monk quests where they can have their intrinsic AC or dam/delay raised through a quest rather than a item, possibly getting those quest items off the same mobs with the same frequencies as monk item drops now. They could be questhounds rather than gearhounds. <br>But, alas, it's too late for that now, I guess.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, it's never too late to ask. I like the idea of making monks more reliant on their hands than on weapons, on their skills than on armor. You're right, it might be too late to make such a dramatic change. But it warrants at least asking. There's no reason that a skill can't be just as hard to get as an item, just put the trainer at the end of a tough quest. <br><br>Pantheon wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Throwing should get a chance of doing criticals]</i></font> <br><br>Interesting idea. This can also be used to increase monks damage a bit. That it, IF it needs to be increased. But if anyone is going to be the master of throwing, it may as well be monks. <br><br>Feilong Zai'Tian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Absor you can read many good suggestion here at&#8230;]</i></font> <br><br>Well, the whole idea of this thread is to get the ideas into one place where I can read them. I'm not going to run all over following links. If the ideas are good, sum them up and bring them in, I'll be glad to read them. <br><br>Terata wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Beyond this my only real problem is the completely arbitrary way Feign Death starts working differently if the NPC is above level 32. Is there a purpose to this beyond making me stand up and hit Feign ten times just to be sure?]</i></font> <br><br>I can ask. I don't know if this was an 'arbitrary' decision or an informed one. But I can certainly ask. <br><br>brin_summer said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - round kick(lv5), tiger claw(lv10), eagle strike(lv20), dragon punch(lv25) and flying kick(lv30). <br>: currently, these serve nothing more than slight upgrade in dmg. but all of them are capped at 225...why? i have yet to see high level monk use anything other than flying kick because there is no reason to use lesser dmg-ing skills.<br>: why not give each skill distinct trait? for example.. round kick would attain stunning ability(much like warrior's kick at 55+), tiger claw would attain debuff effect, dragon punch would do 2% of mob's health dmg, and flying kick would deal high dmg,etc.. i am sure you guys could come up with better traits.]</i></font> <br><br>Certainly an interesting idea. It might be a nightmare to balance, though. And it might add too much to the power of the class. But it's a solid concept, so I'll add it. <br><br>Sskai wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Something between the bo sticks/batons from Dalnir and the Wu's Quivering Staff/Wu's Trance Sticks from CoM would be nice. Decent 2hb for monks are rare anyway, and a few more weapons in the mid level ranges would encourage more people to train up their 2hb skill.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok. Added to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Please please make thunder kick less of an embarssment. Those 24 point kicks are just silly. <br>Since monks get no special discipline at 55, how about adding one with a stun component?]</i></font> <br><br>That seems to be a good way to introduce a stun ability, if we decide to go that route. <br><br>Gestaltmind wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Perhaps some old abilities might gain new twists as you got high level- like a criticial hit on a normal kick after you reach level 50.]</i></font> <br><br>That thought occurred to me just as I was reading the first line of your post. I think you have chosen the right chat handle&#8230; I like this idea, it makes sense. But, once again, only if monks really need a combat boost. <br><br>Carissa wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Lastly from me is something that I feel is above all these issues and that's look. I pulled up screenshots of myself from level 5. ]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br>Devon11 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Monks should have greater damage evasion skills than they currently have post 50. By this I mean Dodge, Block, Riposte, and maybe another. They are martial arts experts after all.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, this is something that I seem to have encountered with the shadow knight talk earlier. Some want offense, some want defense. Keep in mind that it is highly unlikely that getting both would be balanced. When compared to a warrior, a monk will either be more offensive and less defensive, or the other way around. Being better at both isn't balanced. <br><br>I'll have to find out what the, um&#8230;, Vision &#8482; is for this class, and then we'll look at both offense and defense. <br><br>Zadkiel said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3a) Encourage usage and training of lesser monk special attacks.<br>Either allow us to use one type of strike and one type of kick at the same time by unhooking the special attack re-use timers post-50, or give the possibility of attack "strings". (This is the preferred solution, but would be harder to implement.) If a monk successfully uses Flying Kick on an enemy -- connects for damage -- then give a chance (based on Double Attack skill, preferably) for the monk to automatically use Dragon Punch/Tail Rake. If Dragon Punch/Tail Rake connects for damage, give a slightly lesser chance of doing an Eagle Strike. This is not only an interesting solution, it would make raising all of the monk special attack skills more important. This would be a post-50 enchancement, or when a monk reaches 200 skill in Flying Kick.]</i></font> <br><br>Also interesting. Of course, this sounds an awful lot like triple attack&#8230; but done in a monkly fashion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Allowing us to strike just as hard with the off-hand as the primary will solve the damage-dealing problem and bring us up to the correct damage level of being between warriors and rogues. <br><br>If this change is made, you will need to remove MNK as a class capable of using the moss-covered twig, a weapon changed to be off-hand only because of the large amount of damage it does when a damage bonus is applied.]</i></font> <br><br>Maybe&#8230; it also sounds like it has a very high potential chance of bringing that damage output well above rogues&#8230; And having to go back and look over every monk-usable weapon list to make sure one of them isn't broken because of a change like this, well, that puts this idea very low on the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5) Fix the Celestial Fist effect.<br>Celestial Tranquility is a great effect on our epic, but it stacks with almost NOTHING. Most monks rarely solo post-50, and most common group buffs will keep the effect from working. (Call of Earth, enchanter haste spells, most bard songs, Speed of the Shissar, etc.) At least alter it so that even if the haste is not usable due to other, better buffs then the additional effects -- the extra +AC and +ATK -- will stack anyway, similar to the way the Robe of the Whistling Fists worked. It's pretty bad when a well-meaning ranger tosses me Call of Earth and costs me 54ATK and 12AC. The ranger buff especially does not make sense because Call of Earth is NOT a Haste Buff, and the Celestial Tranquility Effect will indeed stack with the upgrade, Strength of Earth.]</i></font> <br><br>That seems to make sense to me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7) At least consider spreading the weight limit increase out over the post-50 levels.<br>Few monks will make 55. Even fewer will make 60. Therefore, weight increases at those two points are not terribly useful. A 2lb increase every other level (i.e., 52, 54, 56, etc) would result in a weight limit of 24 at 60. A 1lb increase every post-50 level would be another way to implement the changes, and would also result in a weight limit of 24 at level 60. If these are "too much" of a weight increase (the current max weight limit at 60 is 22lbs, from four-pound increases at 55 and 60) then skip levels 55 and 60, when we get our passive enhancements of +1 HP per tick while feigned.]</i></font> <br><br>This also makes sense to me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Skill Caps.<br>Kick caps at 250. So why does Flying kick, eagle strike, and dragon punch all cap at 230?]</i></font> <br><br>I don't know&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Also, it was recently announced that they upped the caps for the Hand to Hand skill to equal 1hb/2hb, but all that was raised was the 60 cap, the 50 cap is still only 225 compared with 1hb/2hb cap of 240, so the 50 cap needs to be increased to 240 as well.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In addition, since kunark came out, people have noticed that feign is seen through more and more when the monk is down below 2 bubbles of health. This is a situation where the monk has successfully met the skill check (no "fallen" message), no spell was cast on the monk since they fd'ed, but the mob keeps pounding away. In the monk community this is refered often to as the "frenzy code". When a mob decides that they are going to kill you, they will kill you regardless. I personally have had times where I fd 8 or 9 times successfully in a row, but still have the mob continue to beat on me. Feign at above 2 bubbles of health, and this HARDLY happens. <br>So, at higher levels fd is useless as an escape tactic.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks, that's a useful explanation of the situation. I'll use it. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: a) revert the hole and sov so that mobs train back instead of walking back at the same time<br>b) increase the fd skill significatly (post 50 I should not be getting the "fallen" message as much as I do.<br>c) post 50, spells that hit us after we feign, or at least aoe spells) should NOT break feign. Yes we can take the damage, dot, etc..but it should not break the feign.<br>d) give us a short reuse disicipline that will clear our aggro 100%. Seem overpowering? not at all, we can already do this, its called /q. remember your downtime thread? having a monk /q to clear aggro is just silly. with /q and the mages coh, there is no reason not to have this.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm pretty sure that doing all of these things is just too much. But I can ask them to look at the situation. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Bug report: controls locked up upon standing from a fd. <br>Every once in a while when the monk stand from a feign death, they can only move forwards or backwards. not side to side. The only way to fix this is to fd again (waiting the 10 seconds). <br>Bug report: Feign death does not work if the monk is in an area where they are forced to crouch.<br>try feigning from the lava elememental just out side of his area in sola. the ceiling is low enough that the monk has to crouch, and fd will never, ever work there.]</i></font> <br><br>Also noted. <br><br>Nightflash wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Treant Fists, what can I say. The stats are almost identical to the Gem inlaid gauntlets, but I can do the Gem inlaid gauntlet quest roughly 9 or 10 times, or more with the help of a druid, in the time it takes to do the Treant fist quest. And I can do it much earlier in level. ]</i></font> <br><br>Alright, I'll add the Treant Fists to the list. A sort of 'back by popular demand' kind of thing. <br><br>Ishahmael said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4th Min Dmg on Flying Kick. My lvl 56 monk FKs for 3 and Thunder Kicks for 24. OMG, how LAME!]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, ok. No need to beat me to death with this one&#8230; sheesh! <br><br>Burnstain wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: C. Un-bind the Strike and Kick attacks. A monk could use Flying Kick and a Tiger Claw independently of one another.]</i></font> <br><br>Another idea that I can at least mention to the team. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I don't think this problem could be handled without adding some sort of new skill..perhaps something called 'Tumble' which allows the monk to use acrobatics to back out of the combat...working similar to evade but nowhere near as reliable.]</i></font> <br><br>Hmm&#8230; Something that would be super defensive, prevent the monk from doing any damage, and allow him to back out (perhaps dropping them lower on the hate list). Oddly, that sounds like what feign death was supposed to do&#8230; :)<br><br>Noted. <br><br>RegorDragonfist wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The sashes and headbands should have AC and stats comparable to the shackels.]</i></font> <br><br>Bears looking into. <br><br>Keep in mind, though, those of you that are asking for some bonus for being a human monk. You already have a huge bonus. You do not pay an experience penalty for your race. That's even more important now that the burden for that penalty is on the individual character, not that group. <br><br>Merzak said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Dodge for Monks should work on creatures hitting us from behind. I think this would be consistent with the idea of a class that is supposed to have a heightened awareness of its surroundings.

This may not be a popular opinion, but it is true. The Robe of the Lost Circle is obtainable by killing the quest NPC's (please change this). Headbands and sashes can be traded instead of quested for. The Robe of the Whistling Fists can be multi-quested. Once the last robe is obtained, three groups can do all four of the battles needed to get the fists, and none of the mobs are rare spawns. In theory, you only need to camp two components - the pipes for the RotWF - the rest can be purchased or killed for. Our epic weapon should mean more than that.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for saying that. I appreciate it. And, well, it will end up on the list. <br><br>Thane wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why was netted/woven/mesh armor omitted from Froglok drops in Kunark?.

But, whenever anything comes up that could offset the game balance to *any* degree, VI is quick to respond. This is just my perception and opinion.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, I guess this is where this whole thing gets kind of strange for me. I'm reading here how a people are telling us that, since it has been so long since this item was introduced, we should just leave it. Yes, we move slowly sometimes, nobody is denying that. And yet, even with this 'nerf' having taken us six months to get to, it is still the bugs that people see as on the back burner for a long time&#8230; <br><br>*shrug* <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I know there have been many favorable changes to the game, and as a paying customer, I appreciate them.

Look at it and try to understand how it would completely change the entire game, and not for the better. <br><br>I certainly understand your philosophy about only adding and never taking away. And it's the most pleasant route to take. But that route can only lead to disaster. If we never 'nerf' anything, then we have to spend every moment trying to push everything up to meet the standard of the best. If we make one tiny mistake and overpower one item, then we have to spend months (and I do mean months) boosting everything up to meet it. A few years from now we'd probably just have to start people a 50th level with planer gear so that they wouldn't be underpowered&#8230; <br><br>Sorry, as much as we would like to take the easy route, it's also the road to disaster. <br><br>Cattie_Luv said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I just don't see the point in nerfing an item 0.05% of the server population will actually posess and make use of it.]</i></font> <br><br>This is another sentiment that I don't understand. It seems, to me at least, self contradictory. You are saying that we shouldn't make this change because it only affects a very small number of players (which, by the way, I disagree with). But if it only affects 0.05% of the server population, than how can it be such a big deal that we change it? <br><br>Zariq wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is one (1) thing that stops it from being overpowered, rarity.]</i></font> <br><br>And that may be true. But the rarity of any item decreases over time in EverQuest. As time passes, more of the item enters the game, but rarely do any leave. With an item like this, probably none ever leave. So the rarity decreases with every passing day. Soon, the overpowering effect of an item like this pervades the game, and ruins it. <br><br>Celdor wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As a DM since the days when D&D was called Chainmail&#8482;, I can tell you that the worst thing a GM can do is feel offended that the players outsmarted you.]</i></font> <br><br>That's absolutely true. And if you think that we are making this change out of some sort of anger over being outsmarted, you are mistaken. I've explained several times how unbalancing this item is. We're changing it because it is broken, and that is the only reason. <br><br>Jovius wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Thank you for your well thought out presentation, although it was clearly lost on a lot of people . I think your doing a great job so far.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks. And, well, I was wrong to put that six month thing like I did. No matter the case, yes, we should have made a far more dramatic change earlier. We should have noticed the possible effect on the game a while ago. We didn't. I'm not, however, going to say that this should have been easy to see. Seeing that the item was broken is one thing (and we did, that's why the casting time was raised). But seeing the wide range potential problem with this thing is not as easy as your going along as it is when looking back at it. <br><br>Doktor_Nobbins wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Honestly?

I, personally, don't think the item should have been allowed to remain in the game. I didn't say that to get a rise out of anyone, but just to express how broken I think it is. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think for the great majority of us, the nerf represents a reasonable attempt to work out a situation that clearly needed your attention.

The dedicated "talk" threads dedicated to individual classes continues to be the dominate issues tackled by Alan on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807.html"><b>Bard Talk</b></a><br>Ok, I suspect you've been preparing for this, so I'll warn Akriss to be ready to split this thing&#8230; <br><br>So let's have it. Tell me what needs balancing for bards. You may as well give me bugs and broken stuff too. But my focus is going to be on things that are needed to move bards closer to 'balanced' in the game. This may include a nerf or two, I want to warn you of that. I am just as willing to suggest a negative change that helps to achieve balance as a positive one. <br><br>Also, I understand that a bard is a complicated class to play. And I have no problem with that. This complicated nature will always mean that there are fewer bards in the game than other classes. I'm fine with that too. <br><br>Please, be detailed where you need to. Try to avoid abbreviations, my simian mind can't decipher many of them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052812.html"><b>Monk Talk</b></a><br>I'm starting this thread today because I'll be leaving for Baltimore earlier than I had expected. I will have little access to the Internet while I'm there, and I don't want to start a thread like this right before I leave. Also, for you Rogues reading, I'm moving you back to Tuesday next week, I won't be in the office on Monday. <br><br>Monks are one of those interesting types of warrior that, as a class, we have tried to balance a rather large volume of damage dealing with a lesser type of armor. It's not an easy task to build a fighting class that is 'balanced' with a warrior but doesn't wear armor&#8230; <br><br>So tell me what you think needs to be changed about monks. Keep in mind that I am primarily looking for balance issues, but give me whatever you've got. I am also not looking for suggestions that would dramatically change the class, or that would require an army of people to get into the game. I'm mostly looking for tweaks that would help to balance the class.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809.html"><b>Warrior Talk</b></a><br>What is there to say about warriors? <br><br>The idea of this thread is to talk about how to balance the warrior class in the game of EverQuest. I must admit that I don't really expect to see too many suggestions. The warrior seems to be a well balanced class. And we have to keep in mind that the warrior is a sort of staple class, upon which the relative balance of several other classes hinges directly. <br><br>So this is the forum to talk about what is right and what is wrong with warriors. Go ahead and tell me about bugs you've seen too. I'm not focusing on them, I'm concentrating on class balance here. But I will also take note of non-balance concerns as well. <br><br>Have at it, muscle-bound-types.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-2.html"><b>Enchanter Talk, Part 2</b></a><br>Here&#8217;s what I have as a sort of summary so far. Keep in mind that I wrote this yesterday evening (during Survivor&#8230;), so it does not take into account posts made after that. I am reading them today, though. <br><br>The first thing to think about is how enchanters work against the high-hit point creatures of Velious. Do they have enough to contribute over the course of a fight with such monsters? <br><br>I&#8217;m not sure that enchanters are in need of help in this area. Perhaps the addition of something like a DoT-pet would help. <br><br>Really, where the majority of higher level enchanters are expressing their concern is that there are too many creatures that are immune to mesmerization-type (and secondarily charm) spells. As I noted earlier, I&#8217;m not real sure that we can increase the functionality of those spells because they would simply over-balance the enchanter in those encounters (encounters where one or two very strong enemies are intended to challenge large groups, and one charm or mesmerization spell would eliminate all or half of the challenge). <br><br>I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;ve seen an answer to this situation that will work. <br><br>Rampage: This line does not stack with other strength buffs. We should evaluate this, and decide if this is how it should be. <br><br>DoT Pet: Something not unlike the clerical hammer spell, to add more to the ability of the enchanter to help during fights with extremely high hit point enemies. <br><br>Illusions: Mostly, you want more illusions. There are also a few requests to add effects to some illusions. <br><br>Illusion, Wolf: There has been a call to have this spell grant Spirit of Wolf. If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors. I&#8217;ll have it on the list. I am very much against such homogenization of the classes. In fact, so much so that I don&#8217;t really think that enchanters should even be allowed to transform into wolves at all. <br><br>Illusion, Gender: Seems like a good request. <br><br>Illusion, Group Elemental (or race): A spell that grants the elemental illusions (or race) to the group. <br><br>Illusion, Change Size: Some sort of illusion that makes the caster bigger or smaller. This is something that I am against, assize change is really the area of the shaman. <br><br>Illusion Monster (and any copycat illusion): a spell that lets the enchanter copy the appearance of either a random monster in the zone, or a targeted creature. Faction issues will most certainly disallow this, but it&#8217;s listed. <br><br>Major Illusion: If possible, a high level spell (even 60th if needed) that has the functionality of the original minor illusion spells. One that brings back the enormous illusions that were possible with that spell. <br><br>Illusion face: Would give the enchanter a random face. <br><br>Illusion Races Bug: It seems that some illusions don&#8217;t resize the character properly to people that enter the zone after the illusion is cast. We should take a look for the giant gnomes and see if we can fix them. <br><br>Undead Illusions: I, frankly, feel that enchanters shouldn&#8217;t have these spells. I will ask that we look at them, and consider that they are the territory of the necromancer. <br>Phantom armor: It would be awesome to create an illusion spell that allowed the enchanter to look like he is wearing plate. Perhaps a new spell similar to the magician phantom line (perhaps just like it) that has this illusionary effect (and we should also think of adding this to the magician spells...)<br><br>Enchanting Items: I will add this to the list as a reminder. <br>Lull spells: These spells seem to be resisted too easily, more often used to pull than to break up a group. There should be at least a fair chance that the creature resisting this spell will not immediately aggro. <br><br>Bard Lute: We should at least look at this loot. Even if we don&#8217;t remove it (it is a very rare item), we should keep it in mind when making new items. It gives a key enchanter ability to another class. <br><br>Voice Graft: We should evaluate the idea of giving this spell to all pet classes, including enchanters. <br><br>Whirl til you hurl and Dyn's Dizzying Draught: Players feel that these spells are too easily resisted and too easily broken. <br><br>Mesmerization spells: There are some targets that are unaffected by these spells, either due to level or race. Our anti-undead spell lines give the character back a message when he tries to cast on an invalid target, and the spells don&#8217;t even cast (costing the caster no mana). We should consider this approach for mez spells as well. <br><br>Mesmerization spells and overwriting: Are single target mez spells supposed to overwrite area of effect mez spells? It seems that perhaps they should. Minimally, higher level mez spells should overwrite lower level mez spells. <br><br>Mesmerization (Charm) Indicator: I, personally, don&#8217;t really like this idea. But there is a call for a change of the color of a monster&#8217;s name when it is under the effects of mez and charm so that people know by looking. <br><br>Low level Evocation practice spell: Enchanters don&#8217;t seem to have a spell like Flare with which they can practice their evocation skills early on. <br><br>Tiny Daggers: These items are unavailable in Qeynos. This needs to be fixed <br><br>Pet Positioning: Because enchanters can&#8217;t tell there pets where to go, they often get in the way. There is a tendency with all pets to stand right in front of their master. This is a bit of a pain when the caster is trying to target something, or just trying to see something. Can we have pets (all pets) default to standing behind their master? <br><br>'Charm wears off': players report that this message is sometimes sent long after the charm has worn off, after the creature is dead sometimes. <br><br>Reoccurring Amnesia: The reports are pretty overwhelming, this spell does not reoccur. <br><br>Boon of the Clear Mind: This is a group clarity spell, and should probably overwrite Clarity, and it does not. Either spell should probably overwrite the other, basically just increasing the duration (and the same should apply to the clarity 2 spells). It also seems that this spell has a very short useful life span. Lowering the level of this spell would allow its use for longer before they get Clarity 2. <br><br>Failure Messages: Some spells (Lull series and stuns against giants are primary examples) give the same message on failure that they do on success. If it fails it probably should say so. <br><br>Mask Faith: Players have been asking for the ability to mask their religion for a while. I think this is a bad idea. But I have a logical argument in favor of it, so I&#8217;m presenting it. I like the idea of characters having to deal with their religious choice, even enchanters. But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic. That's something that I don't like at all. The solution to the problem here (the problem being that there are now very few enchanters that are not agnostic) might be moving their spells so they don&#8217;t have to enter dangerous cities (which they can&#8217;t get into if they have a religion), or making religion more valuable. <br><br>Cantana (a bard song) and Clarity: I was under the impression that clarity spells would stack with bard mana regeneration songs. There might be something wrong with the stacking of these two spells. It seems that the bard song will stack over the enchanter spell, but the song must be stopped or the enchanter spell won&#8217;t take. <br><br>Blanket of Forgetfulness: Is this spell supposed to be more effective than it is? <br><br>Collaboration: This spell does not seem to have any affect in Skyfire, but it does in Kael Drakkal. Is this a bug? <br><br>Illusions and Link Death: Can we make it so that Illusions remain up during a link death (not during zoning, though). <br><br>The Essential Enchanter: We should look into why an enchanter is considered &#8216;essential&#8217; in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that. <br><br>Resplendent Robe: The effect is Rune IV, but it requires a component? That seems wrong. <br><br>Rune IV: The cost of the gem used to cast this spell might be too high. <br><br>Boon of the Garou: We should probably up the duration by thirty seconds or something, so that the spell can be kept up on two targets without it dropping (the duration is currently exactly twice the recast time). <br><br>Tash Line: The thought from the players is that this line causes too much aggro. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s that way for balance or if it is perhaps an exaggeration. We should look at this. <br><br>Recast Bug on fast spells: After casting a spell, sometimes attempts to cast fast casting spells (Tash line, for example) will not cast right away, and will give a "this spell is not ready message".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857.html"><b>Donal's Breastplate to be Nerfed</b></a><br>We've changed this item before because we thought it was overpowered. Unfortunately, it is still overpowered. Let me explain why. <br><br>This item is a breastplate that is only usable by clerics. If you right click this item, it will cast a Complete Heal on your target with a casting time of 30 seconds. It uses no mana to produce this effect. <br><br>A group of two characters, one cleric wearing this breastplate and one warrior, can defeat any opponent, as long as that opponent can not kill the warrior in under 30 seconds. <br><br>Let me restate that. <br><br>One cleric and one warrior, using this one magic item, can defeat ANY opponent or any number of opponents that are not capable of killing the warrior in under 30 seconds. <br><br>I hope that the impact that this game dynamic has on the game is obvious to everyone. If we allow this item to remain in the game as it is, we will have to change the game so that monsters are capable of killing a warrior in 30 seconds. 15 seconds if the group consists of two clerics with this breastplate and one warrior, and it gets worse from there... <br><br>Of course, if we make the world so hard that this breastplate is not overwhelmingly powerful, we would have to, essentially, rebuild the game, rebalance the classes&#8230; No single item should be so powerful that the balance of the game revolves around it. Adjusting the game to fit this item is not a choice. We need to change the item to fit the game. <br><br>We have had a fair amount of internal debate over this item. It really comes down to two choices. Eliminate the item entirely, or change the way it works. We would rather change the way it works. After much debate and some conversations with players that have characters that use this item, we decided on the following change. <br><br>The item will cast a new spell (to be named later). The effect of this spell will be to completely heal the target. The spell will also leave a buff on the recipient that lasts somewhere between five and ten minutes (we are leaning toward a compromise of 7.5 minutes). This buff will have some small positive effect (perhaps a 1 point regenerative effect), but as long as this buff is on a character, he can not receive the effect of this spell again. This buff will not be removable until its duration runs out. <br><br>In practice, what this will mean is that the cleric with a Donal's Breastplate will be able to heal anyone he wants every 30 seconds. But he will not be able to heal the same person twice unless 7.5 minutes has passed between healings. The breastplate will still almost completely eliminate downtime due to hit point loss, and it will no longer destroy the game dynamic of EverQuest. <br><br>There is one concern that we have as to this implementation, and I'd like your feedback on it. <br><br>There are some cases where a character would have all of his buff slots full and be unable to gain a new buff. This new Donal's effect would be, essentially, a buff. We can either have it overwrite a current buff, or have the spell fail if the character has a full load of buffs on him. I can see arguments for either implementation, and I want to hear your thoughts on it. <br><br>Yes, we know this is a 'nerf'. And, frankly, we're willing to nerf this item to save the game as a whole. We are sorry about ever creating an item that is so easily unbalancing to the game, and we're sorry that we have to change it again. For now, I can't tell you when this change will take place. It won't be until after we've finished the work that has us on hold for updating the game. When I have a better timeframe, I'll certainly let you all know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052728.html"><b>On Shadow Kights</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: From shadowknights being labelled a 'defensive' class when we see ourselves as 'offensive', to this latest blunder with the spells and what levels we gain them&#8230;]</i></font> <br><br>Well, actually, that was not a 'blunder'.

Sorell Oldewolf sent in the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>Saturday night was a blast on Tarrew Marr for the Shadowdragons and Celestial Keepers!  I know it was only Befallen, wrong!  It was what a guild is all about! Friends getting together and having a blast.  We had 2 groups one camped the second level of befallen, and one the third level of befallen.  The undead quaked and fell by the score!  Handily our beloved Phlora (51 Vicar) stood by closely in case she was needed for the occassional res.  Special thanks should go to Rantu, Eigoud, Cymrik, Sulimon, and Goldenrod/Lhytebreeze for being there to help  watch over everything.

Neverly's latest editorial entitled <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid980733951,70320,">2cp For a SoW? Anyone?</a> has been published to our Editorial section.  Here's a clip:<UL>Now, unbeknownst to me, there had been a commentary running for some minutes before my entrance. It concerned, predictably enough, the stupidity of &#8220;newbies&#8221;, and was voiced by two 25th level characters: one druid and one warrior. The druid had been approached by a young halfling in the same situation as my own &#8211; he needed a SoW (Spirit of the Wolf) to retrieve his corpse. His request, though quite common, was answered with a string of insults, digs, and shouts of &#8220;LOL!!!&#8221; that filled many a passerby&#8217;s chat window to overflowing. Walking in at the end of this, I just caught the druid&#8217;s concluding statements as he voiced interest in having all newbies systematically destroyed by a wayward &#8220;bug&#8221;. Being largely unaware of the situation at that point (I was filled in later by a compliant wood elf), I ignored the harsh words and within moments had sent a tell politely requesting an SoW from the druid in question. Needless to say, the response I received was less than flattering. However, after a bit of verbal dueling and some liberal use of my stress ball, I managed to wrestle a response that wasn&#8217;t awash in abbreviated giggling, which I now quote:<br><br>&#8220;SoW is my main source of income, so, if you can&#8217;t pay, don&#8217;t ask.&#8221;<br><br>His main source of income, he says. I read that line with eyebrows raised, unbelieving. Could it be true? Could this man have such a long line of impatient customers that to spare a bit manna and some time for a 7th level cleric severely crimped his financial plans? Of course not, he was simply being nasty. Realizing this, I complemented him on his dedication to character, remarking that there has to be some greedy scumbags in the world. I then left, sans a SoW, and made my way towards Halas once again, tottering along and finding my mind occupied by the entire idea of charging for spells.* </UL>Enjoy!

The Enchanter class discussion was started today on the Gameplay Board.  Read all about it in the Absor Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html"><b>Enchanter Talk</b></a><br>Unfortunately, as will probably be the case from here out, I just don't have time to do any research before starting this post. I'll have to rely on you folks to tell me all I need to know about enchanters&#8230; :)<br><br>Again, the usual reminder. I am primarily looking for balance concerns here. But I am certainly willing to put bugs on the list. Also, though I really do understand the fact that you want to emphasize and back up statements by others, please, please try to keep the repeat information to a minimum. I'm finding that by page three or four on these threads I'm rereading the same suggestions by people that start their posts with "I didn't read this thread, so I don't know if this had been said&#8230;" I don't want to stifle any creativity. But I have to admit that I tend to get bleary eyed reading the same suggestions over and over again, and I know I'm missing good new ideas late in threads when they are buried among things that others have covered several times before. <br><br>So, please, let's hear what you think is unbalanced or broken about enchanters. Here are the few things that I had already jotted down: <br><br>Gift of Brilliance: When compared to similar buffs by Clerics and Shamans this spell doesn&#8217;t seem good enough. Sure, it will see use, but it could be a better spell. Quick comparison: <br><br>Aeogolism (60th level Cleric spell): Adds 1,100 to max hit points and 54 to AC for a single target. Lasts 2.5 hours. Costs 750 mana.<br>Focus of the Spirit (60th level Shaman spell): Adds 405 hit points, 67 strength and 60 dexterity for a single target. Lasts 1.5 hours. Costs 500 mana.<br>Gift of Brilliance (50th level Enchanter spell): Adds 150 mana and grants a mana regeneration rate increase of 2 points per tick for a single target. Lasts 1.5 hours. Costs 450 mana. <br><br>The Shaman and Cleric spells essentially replace other buffs. Gift of Brilliance stacks with Clarity II. It might be nice to have the mana regeneration be 2 points greater than Clarity II and NOT stack with it so that enchanters could use it to save a slot. And perhaps rather than increasing the mana bonus, give it an intelligence bonus. But perhaps at this level enchanters just don't need any more intelligence boosts&#8230; <br><br>Illusions drop when zoning: Is there a gameplay reason behind the fact that illusions drop when you zone? If not, can we make it so they do not? <br><br>More Illusions: I think it&#8217;s a good idea to dig through the list of current global characters and see if there are a few more illusions that we can give to enchanters. <br><br>I know there are more issues&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052156.html"><b>Apologizes Stupid?</b></a><br>Analogies are like socks.

Because it was an improvement. I don't know of anyone that thinks it was not an improvement. That's a bold statement to make, but I believe it to be true.

Another auction site has been forced to close their EQ sections, this time around it's a place called EGA.  Here's the first letter sent out by the admins of eGamesAuctions:<UL>Hello xxxxxx xxxxxx, <br><br>This is another update to all members.<br><br>We are keeping everyone up do date on the EQ Crisis thus far.  Well, our membership keeps growing so we guess the word is not completely out.  Yesterday, we were served at our office to stop all EQ related auctions immediatly or go to jail for the eve and seek legal in the morning.  The only thing that saved our gear from being seized etc was that we did not make profit in the week we opened.<br><br>Again, we put a lot of time, sleepless nights and funds into EGA trying  to devote it to EQ.  All members thus far have been very supportive and we thank you so <br>much.  We have added 2 new categories for the upcoming online games that are  "Totally Fine" about us buying and selling!  They are Anarchy Online and Ultima Online 2.  We also added some console gaming categories to the list.<br><br>We hope EGA will still be THE site on the net for Online Game Gear.  And if the change arises one day or Sony Online sees there demise this action may cause them in the future. We hope to add that Category again.<br><br>We also wish the best to our competitors, playerauctions.com.  It seems the same may have happened to them.  I hope they hang in there myself, if possible.<br><br>Last thing, if you wish to cancel you account.  Please just send us an email to support stating please cancel me at  this time.  We will back-up the status and make it inactive in case you wish to rejoin in the future.<br><br><br>Thanks for the support<br><br>Robert<br>EGA (New Asherons Call) Gamer</UL>A few minutes later they sent this one out:<UL>Hello xxxx xxxx,,<br><br>Bad news all,<br><br>I just got a knock on the door of my office with court orders from the Alaska Attorney Generals Office to stop all Everquest related auctions immediatly or have all our items seized and we would go to jail (this is no joke).<br><br>EGA gave it a hell of a try, but it seems Sony Online Games has a bit more legal presence then we do.<br><br>We have to remove the Everquest category from our auction.<br>We apoligize for this but we had no idea that the courts in all states have already been advised of actions.<br><br> Hang in there all and maybe one day it will be our world.<br><br>Sincerly<br><br>Robert<br>EGA Head Gamer</UL>To discuss and comment on this issue check out this <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=8656472&replies=103">message board thread</a>.

Valeera Edhel encountered a unique Dark Elf last night:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night while adventuring in South Karana,  I ran into an evil yet strikingly beautiful Dark Elf. She said her name was The Negotiator. She claimed to be lost. I asked this poor soul how I could be of assistance. She said that she came from the Castle Mistmoore. Shocked by this, I asked how she ended up so far from home. She had chased someone from the castle and traveled beyond the boundaries. Chased him all the way past the great city of Freeport. Alas, she had lost him at some bridge. By this time many other adventurers had gathered to listen to her tale of woe. Many tried to offer her help, but she only shrugged her shoulders in reply. The Negotiator then became hostile turning on those who had offered to help her. She even forced the beautiful druid Ambur to slay one of her own brothers. Chaos ensued as we all tried to figure out what she wanted. But she had great powers, and could make herself disappear. Alas, the great enchanter Pooja was able to slay this foul being and send her back to the depths of evil in which she came.  I shall never forget my experience with the dark and beautiful one. And never forget that evil shows itself in many ways to the adventurers of Norrath.<br> <br>Valeera Edhel<br>29th Season Wood Elf Ranger<br>Torvonnilous</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for sending in the report!

Solusek Ro is 1 server farm). Now if each server farm contains at least 15 servers. You then have to do maintenance on at least 540 servers. ]</i></font><br><br>Actually it's nearly 1000 total boxes currently. We have to do continual upgrades to keep ahead of the technology curve. Frankly, I'm amazed that our Ops group can do system-wide config changes and down and up that many servers in 8 hours. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051570.html"><b>Making Items NO-DROP</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: VI needs to make it a policy to give 3 days warning minimun before making items no drop]</i></font> <br><br>Well I think that my main apologies go to the fact that it wasn't mentioned in the patch message. We weren't planning on doing items just yet, and ended up needing to put them in last night for what we did in PoM. Testing was spending all of their time (at our request) checking that stuff out. <br><br>Still, I can't say with certainty that we would have pre-announced (e.g. given warning) the changes to NODROP. From gamers perspective, the zone just "opened" a few days ago, last Saturday as I recall, even though it's been available for a while. This was essentially the 3rd business day, and we've been known to move fast to fix mistakes such as that. <br><br>It's a very debatable subject. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: They ninja'd:<br>spawn rates<br>drop rates<br>spawn size ]</i></font><br><br>Just to clear up what we patched, we patched 3 zones and items. That's a very small patch as they go. It didn't include any executable files, or anything having to do with spells, so the perception about changes to combat mechanics, fizzles, resist rates, etc., certainly didn't go in. As for spawn rates, drop rates, and such, we don't announce those anyway. I belive the term 'ninja' has been applied to things that we should announce but don't. <br><br>Though I guess that's debatable as well :)</UL>

It was intended for exaclty what the topic stated. Unfortunately, too many people have taken this thread too far from it's intended purpose, and it has essentially become worthless for its intent. I find that a shame, really, because we were actually looking for some new ideas about summoned items. I can only hope that the developer that asked me to start this thread has found some use for it before it was sidetracked...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051824-2.html"><b>Shadow Knight Talk, Part 2</b></a><br>As a starting note, all of us, players and Verant staff, really need to keep in mind that we just recently made a huge improvement to all hybrids by removing the experience costs. That must be kept in mind at all times when thinking about any further changes to hybrids. <br><br>Foxglove1 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Number one. Quit sterotyping SK's as Ogres or Trolls when making items. You ever seen a Erud or DE SK try to wear a full set of BloodEmber armour. Weights a bloody ton!!]</i></font> <br><br>Are they heavier than warrior armor of a similar type? Perhaps they are not overly heavy, but Erudites and Dark Elves are weaklings&#8230; And we also have to keep in mind that, when making armor for shadow knights, Ogres and Trolls can wear them, not just Erudites and Dark Elves. I see your point, but that's the sort of argument that works both ways. <br><br>RunDMZ said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'd ask why we're getting Summon Corpse? I don't recall us ever asking for it and it only seems to be pissing the Necro's off. <br><br>The last HT fix took care of most of our problems.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, that's a good point. The reason for giving Summon Corpse was to make them more wanted in the big raid situation, more or less. Keep in mind, this is the Summon that requires the huge coffin. It's not like the shadow knight is going to be carrying a ton of these things. Having said that, I'm not real sure about that change either. And I may as well bring it up to the team. <br><br>-Dr wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Unable to tank any uber mobs at all , no defensive disc nor any legit offensive disc to use on any uber mobs.]</i></font> <br><br>At all? That's pretty dramatic. Shadow knights get plate, they have fairly good defensive skills&#8230; Are you perhaps exaggerating here? No, a shadow knight can't tank like a warrior, but they shouldn't either. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) lvl 60 disc is arguably less usefull then the lvl 55 disc (harmtouch disc)]</i></font> <br><br>If that's true, then perhaps we should reduce the usefulness of the level 55 discipline&#8230; Ok, just kidding. Along with problems, I also need suggested solutions. Ones that make sense. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) tied with paladins for lowest dmg output of any melee class by a VERY large margin.]</i></font> <br><br>Heh, not really. Firstly, shadow knights are hybrids, not a melee class. It's perfectly acceptable that a melee class like the rogue be doing more damage than a hybrid in combat. Rogues don't get spells. And rangers are the melee damage dealing hybrid. Paladins and shadow knights are far more defensive in their abilities. And, well, we could talk about how shadow knights compare in melee damage to bards&#8230; <br><br>Keep in mind that shadow knights are a hybrid, not a melee class. They will, therefore, not be equal to the melee classes in straight combat ability, that is the price you pay for the ability to cast spells. <br><br>But perhaps we should evaluate the level of combat ability, probably for all the hybrids. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) all spells resisted on uber mobs (other classes have this complaint)thus the penalty we pay for having spells (less melee) is negated]</i></font> <br><br>Ah, I guess I should have read 4 before commenting on 3. :)  Fair point. But you've also had the advantage of those spells all the way up to that very final uber encounter. And some of your spells still work (pets, for example) in a limited way. But, as I said, a review of the combat abilities of hybrids is probably in order. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5) Epic quest issues (not sure if you wanted these or not) <br><br>please see the many threads on this but basically drops off Cazic thule are rare not to mention CT is a farmed god not a triggered spawn, CT is not any harder than the general in Kithicor, in fact prolly easier to kill but because he is farmed you never see him]</i></font> <br><br>True, I don't really want to talk about Epic Quests. But I'll make note of your concern, and we'll leave it at that for now. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6.5) the illogical extra low cap on piercing <br><br>why is piercing a lower cap than slashing or blunt? (or was this fixed?)]</i></font> <br><br>I admit to being slightly baffled as to why you even care about your piercing skill&#8230; But I don't know why it's capped low. My guess would be that it was not considered to be a 'knightly' skill, and that shadow knights needed to have some limits on what they could do in comparison to warriors, so dropping the piercing cap seemed like the right thing to do. I can say that I agree with that idea (especially since it was my reasoning for it&#8230;) <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7)Cash sinks of SK quests. <br><br>Why does lifeleech cost 3kpp to do again? a lvl 50 spell that cost 3k pp AND items to turn in, <br>what makes people think SKs are so rich that they can spend 3kpp just to buy a lvl 50 spell? <br><br>Epic quest costs at least 1900pp to do.]</i></font> <br><br>I dunno. But, well, is this out of line with what other classes are paying for things? Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the costs of researching even the lower level spells for casters&#8230; I'm not sure that these costs are out of line. Especially for the Epic. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 8) Skell form <br><br>not a major issue and i realize you can get skell form items but these are all/all items.

Interesting idea, and I'll put it on the list.

But for now, let's stick to the standard game. I'll have to open a PvP talk later, but I can't do it now, not with all of this going on. <br><br>Rasker Sakarra wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Post 50, we have some issues. First, I would like to know (as many others) why our BASH skill cap is far below a warriors. Warriors rarely if ever use a shield after they get dual wield, however a Shadow Knight (and paladin too) often use a shield from level 1-60. Along with wanting a small increase (not to infringe on warrior territory) in our skill caps (offense, defense, etc), our skills are good ]</i></font> <br><br>I dunno.

You come in and say that with a high dexterity it procs a lot&#8230; <br><br>In any case, no, the pure necro version of this spell would be out of line.

But keep in mind that, well, I can certainly see a reluctance to make them more powerful. Consider that they are primarily a soloing tool for the shadow knight, and we're not real excited about encouraging soloing. And the shadow knight can tank for his pet, using the pet essentially like a DoT. So they don't need to be all that tough. But I will add it to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You did Necros? When ..

When they hit for up to 2800 points a round, this does not extend our tanking abilities even enough to be healed once.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok&#8230; I'm listening&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Given the short duration and high reuse time on the ability, here is a possible solution I see (this is my personal opinion, and does not represent other players) that keeps the current flavor and would prove effective in letting us tank as a warrior using defensive for a short time would be to calculate a factor that scales with an npc's level, and multiply our melee damage times that to determine the amount leechcurse heals. Say for instance level/10. Against level 60 npc's that would make Leechcurse heal 6 points for every point we deal. This brings it approximately up to a warrior using defensive on large encounters, yet scales down on normal mobs to not be unbalancing. The precise factor would need to be determined after tuning.]</i></font> <br><br>That doesn't work for me&#8230; Firstly, it requires that the software look at the enemy to make calculations. It's always better to do these things internally, looking at the caster. After all, the monster level should pretty much scale with the character level&#8230; <br><br>Unfortunately, this is a level 60 discipline, so it can't really scale with the character&#8230; <br><br>Well, I'll add this to the list as is, unless someone comes up with a better implementation. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. Bug: Vampiric Curse (level 57 lifetap dot) and Soul Consumption (The effect on the SK epic weapon) should stack with the cleric Regen-based heals, such as Celestial Elixir. This evidently is something due to be fixed for other such stacking issues.]</i></font> <br><br>Might be a bug, might not. I don't know. But I'll add it to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Overall, most SKs are now happy with the balancing that has been done lately. If the SK (and Paladin) tanking ability against high level npc's is restored to original levels, the majority of the players would have no complaints.]</i></font> <br><br>This seems to be the primary thing to look at, the tanking ability of higher level shadow knights. Keep in mind that, to me at least, 'tanking' is the ability to take a beating without falling over dead. Damage dealing is a separate issue. And shadow knights should be good tanks, and not so good at damage dealing. That is, at least, my opinion (there may be a good argument that shadow knights should be moderately good at both tanking and damage dealing, falling between paladins and rangers&#8230;). Those that want to see more damage from their shadow knight would have to be willing to give up an equal amount of tanking ability, and most don't want that. I see the three hybrids (excluding bards in this instance) as the two sides of the warrior coin, so to speak. The ranger gets most of the damage dealing ability of the warrior, but trades out some of the defense for his spells. Shadow knight and paladins get most of the tanking ability of the warrior and lose some of the damage ability in exchange for their spells. <br><br>That's how I see it at least&#8230; <br><br>Malagen wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My suggestions to enhance Leechcurse are these: 1) Make it so the SK never misses during that 20 second time frame (maybe lower it back to 15 seconds if you think 20 seconds would be overpowering), and 2) Lower the refresh time to 30 minutes, having to wait 72 minutes to reuse a basically useless discipline is rather funny, in a sick way.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. Again, I'm not sure that this is the way to go. But I do see the value of making this discipline do more to make the shadow knight a better tank. <br><br>Protagonist wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Get rid of the casting penalty. <br><br>I honestly do not see the logic behind hybrids having to use more mana to cast watered down versions of their parent classes spells that they get at such a late level that their efectiviness is close to nil to start with. It just makes no sense.]</i></font> <br><br>It makes sense to me. The power of the spell is determined by the level that you get it at. Essentially, if a necromancer gets a spell at 24th level and a shadow knight gets it at 30th, that's a way to control the power of the spells the shadow knight gets. It's essentially 6 levels weaker. Increasing the mana cost for these spells is a way to control the volume of spells, especially since the mana pool for hybrids was brought up recently. <br><br>But I accept that we should probably review the way that all hybrids get their spells. Others at Verant have already suggested that. So it's on my list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The solution for SK's and paladins alike should be as follows: <br>Give SK's and paladins and across the board increase of 10 in all defensive and offensive skill caps. This would be one more skill increase per level from 51-60 and would result in bringing their tanking ability up just a little bit as well as their offensive ability (sk and paladin ofense is so pathetic that it is..well...offensive).]</i></font> <br><br>I'm in favor of increasing the defensive caps on shadow knights (and probably paladins&#8230;). I'm not so sure about offensive caps. Again, that's more along the lines of the ranger area. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Also I would reccomend increasing weapon skills more than 10 points, should Knights really be so unskilled with weapons in comparison to wariors? Keep in mind that this is a balance issue and not a roleplay one. Do the numbers between the damage output of an SK vs that of a warior sometime and you will laugh at how pathetic the sk damage output is.]</i></font> <br><br>Laugh? No. From what I hear (and feel free to correct me), in the upper 50s, similarly equipped shadow knights will do about 2/3 the damage output of a warrior. That seems right to me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Increase SK and Paladin BASH skill caps to equal that of wariors. <br><br>It boggles my mind that THE shield weilding melee classes of norrath are capped 40 points below wariors in bash. This is akin to capping rangers at 200 in archery while allowing wariors to have a 250 skill cap, it just makes no sense.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, if you say THE and 'melee' then you are talking about the warrior, hands down. And that's how it should be. But I'm certainly willing to suggest an increase to the bash cap for both shadow knights and paladins. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Give paladins and sk's a defensive type disc arounc level 57 or so. This will allow them to be usefull against big mobs (sk's and paladins are now the only melee classes who do not have discs that allow them to tank the big mobs). <br><br>Also do something with the level 60 SK Leechcurse disc.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, it's my thought that Leechcurse really should be the defensive discipline that you are looking for. If it healed more, it would be. <br><br>Wyrdrana wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: To be honest, you should open a talk for "hybrid" concerns, or at least put paladins and shadowknights together.. a lot of their concerns are similiar.]</i></font> <br><br>It might have been a good idea to do paladins and shadow knights in one thread. But then there would be just as many people that see them as too different to lump together&#8230; *shrug* <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8230;add a few nifty shields that possibly proc something on a successful bash.]</i></font> <br><br>Nifty idea.

I'll add the life taps (non-quest) to the list. I wouldn't honestly expect a change. Life taps are very useful to a fighting class. They serve a shadow knight well, and I'm not sure they need to be better. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Suggestions? Move gather Shadows to level 22 and most of the heartache of playing the class is gone, since you can at least get where your corpse is after you die.

I do think that invisibility is way too common in EverQuest as it is. But you've got a good argument to back up your suggestion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 49-52 I'm king of the world <br><br>&#8230; <br><br>Suggestions?

Raise HP to match warriors on both Paladins and SKs (At least CH will still be useful on us) but leave the skill caps alone except a 1 point per level post 50 offense increase.
