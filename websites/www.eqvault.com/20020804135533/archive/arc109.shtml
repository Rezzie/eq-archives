Sugan sent me the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>    Sugan searched as much of Faydwer as she could, stopping only to<br>accept the helpful spells of gracious druids. Nothing. She saw not a<br>single Shadow Strider. The redheaded paladin's search covered<br>Butcherblock and Unrest, the forests of Faydark naturally. She even<br>tried venturing into Castle Mistmoore, but was driven back by the<br>Teir'Dal living there.<br>  <br>  The results were there. Seemingly sweeping from night itself, an<br>unknown predator snatched away young wood elves. Taverns were bustling<br>with gossiping bards and the worried parents they catered to, and flyers<br>covered the bulletin boards of every town on the continent. Sugan told<br>all she knew to the elven families, her emotions taxed by the tears of<br>broken mothers. It seemed she only needed mention Shadow Striders for<br>everyone to understand. The words "I'll Do Everything I can" became as<br>dry as the leaves on the beautiful forest's floor. The Feir'Dal felt so<br>small in her human arms, as she comforted them. Sugan could only imagine<br>the delicate frames of their lost children and relatives. Somehow, the<br>vision always portrayed them lifeless...<br>   <br> With a sense of urgency, the paladin left for Freeport again. There<br>was the possibility of finding them before the Festival of Fear, when<br>there would likely be a great number of Teir'Dal and other evils to deal<br>with. It was late one evening that Sugan ventured into the abandoned<br>remains of a Commons land residence. By the warning flags, it had been<br>quarantined as a death camp from the Plague. She was all too familiar<br>with those flags.<br>    <br>Prying the loose boards from a window, Sugan climbed inside and<br>recoiled at the musty decay. There were signs of recent disturbance,<br>obvious enough for someone with no tracking skill to find. She searched<br>about, and in the the corner pulled back a tan cloth. The wall of the<br>house had a rather large hole in it, through which it seemed someone(s)<br>had snuck to avoid disturbing the boards nailed across the door and<br>windows. This wall was so close to the other buildings outside that few<br>would notice. Sugan crawled through the opening but paused with<br>surprise. A shiny object was on the ground directly in front of her. The<br>symbol of her people, the Wind Riders, was clearly engraved on it.<br>   <br> Her heart sank with dread as she tried to follow the trail. Sugan<br>knew the elves had been kept in that death camp, but scolded herself for<br>being too late. And another Wind Rider was to be one of the victims of a<br>terrible game. Festival of Fear, indeed. Night overtook the land as the<br>girl's human eyes searched in vain. Sugan stopped cold at the foot of<br>the great, dark forest called Nektulos...<br><br>Sunday, May 21st - Festival of Fear</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Mabon sent the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>I would like to thank all those who risked life and<br>limb to help us in the raid on Nektulos forest. While<br>many who had wanted to attend were not able to make<br>it, our rather small force fought valiantly against<br>the greater number of Teir'Dal and their allys, many<br>falling to us in one-on-one duels. While most did not<br>cross the bridge this was not our intent.

Haemish sent the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Name_Of_Submitter: Haemish MacLennan<br>Event_name: Karana Guildwar - Dark Oracles vs. Silver Daggers<br>Email: <a href="mailto:haemish@mail.com">haemish@mail.com</a><br>Guild_Sponsoring_Event: Silver Daggers & Dark Oracles<br>Date: 05/21/2000<br>Time: 02:00 PM CST<br>Event_Description: On Sunday, May 21 at 2 pm Central time, the allied guilds Silver Daggers and Dark Oracles, <br>both members of the Karana Council of Guilds, will hold a friendly guildwar in the East Commonlands on the Karana Server. Several rules <br>will be in effect for the duration of the war:<br><br>1) No DOT spells. This is due to exp. loss if you die from these spells. <br>2) No using the zone's NPC's in anyway to cause damage to the other side. No<br>training NPC's and no charmed NPC's. Caster pets are allowed. Also, if a zone NPC intereferes, either stop fighting until that<br>threat is dealt with or you take your chances. They will attack anyone involved in one-on-one or any PvP fights, but they<br>won't necessarily aggro on all participants.<br>3) Non-participants must be listed beforehand, so that they are not attacked. Anyone<br>who attacks a non-combatant is disqualified. Also, non-combatants cannot assist with<br>buffs or heals in combats between guilds. <br>4) No bind point or corpse camping. Also, in battles between the guild, one death is all<br>you get. No one can die, get their corpse and rejoin the battle. Everyone is allowed to<br>get their corpse, but no one can reenter the fights. <br>5) No looting. <br>6) No /anon or /roleplay characters. We do this so that each side can know generally what to expect from the other, for<br>forumlating tactics. <br><br>These are some of the type of fights that we've either done or talked about: <br><br>1) Assassin - One player, the target, from the Daggers will be accompanied by a<br>group of 6 members of the Daggers, who are to escort him from one end of the zone<br>to the other, i.e. from Qeynos to Surefall glade. The other guild puts a group of 6 into<br>the zone, with the purpose of killing the target. If they succeed, roles are reversed,<br>and the Oracles have a target to protect. Best 2 out of 3 tries at this. <br><br>2) Group hunts - Each guild has a group of 6 that enter the zone from opposite ends.<br>They are to hunt each other, in what ever way they see fit. Whichever guild has the<br>last man standing wins. We can do multiple groups if we have enough people who<br>want to. <br><br>3) If there are enough members on both sides, we get together for one big<br>Braveheart-esque battle, a huge scrum. I'd love to do this, but it depends on how many participants we have from each side.<br><br>Specatators are welcome, so long as they do not interfere with the battles or give aid to one side or the other. If there is too <br>much chat chatter in that zone, we'll move it to the West Commonlands. <br><br>To WAR!<br><br>Haemish MacLennan<br>Clan Chieftan<br>The Silver Daggers <br><a href=mailto:mailto:haemish@mail.com>haemish@mail.com</a><br><a href="http://silverdaggers.freehosting.net">http://silverdaggers.freehosting.net</a><br><a href="http://go.to/karanacouncil">http://go.to/karanacouncil</a><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/games/DarkOracle">http://www.angelfire.com/games/DarkOracle</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Haemish!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon's been keeping busy on the boards as normal.  Here's the next round of quotes and excerpts straight off the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043616.html"><b>/Loc Issues</b></a><br>/loc is a very artificial, out-of-character, and therefore undesirable method of direction-finding. It was supposed to be taken out when EQ first went live, but as I understand it it was left in due to public opinion. We really wouldn't want to expand on its use in this manner, as it would cause it to become commonplace.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043578.html"><b>The Risk</b></a><br>Every player has the ability to choose what level of risk is palatable to them. Those who choose to take on greater risk should be able to expect greater rewards and less restrictions upon what they can or cannot do. For example, some people are so opposed to risk that they'll only fight in a dungeon if it is crowded and there is no chance of death, while others will run headlong into certain death all for the prospect of the excitement that comes with the battle. <br><br>Experience loss is part of that risk and part of what creates excitement by making character death something that you definitely don't want to happen. <br><br>The death penalty is one of those things that virtually no one likes, yet is part of what makes the game fun and exciting.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043617.html"><b>Use of Triggers in EQ</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: For example you manage to kill the level 50 lords, now, deeper into the dungeon (behind you is great) 5 lvl 45 body guards come running to the scene... lets say it takes them 1 minute to get to the party. This would increase the danger of such a place, would increase the danger of the lord IMMENSELY.. would completely and utterly destroy the idea of 'camping' this guy... and of course, a single death, would be felt by all.]</i> <br><br>We certainly have the ability to do things of this nature. Many people can probably quote a few spawns that do something like this already. It would be really nice in the one-way dungeons though :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043649.html"><b>Account Problems - How do you prove hacking?</b></a><br>I sincerely apologize if you were treated unfairly here, however the security of an account is the responsibility of the owner of the account. In other words, the owner of an account is reponsible for anything anyone does while logged into the account. <br><br>There are a number of people out there perpetuating scams to try and gain access to accounts, and the best thing that we can do is warn people not to give their passwords away, and remind everyone that we will never, in game or otherwise, ask them for their password. Beyond those warnings, each player needs to be actively aware of attempts to get their confidential information.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043668.html"><b>More on Timorous Deep</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Do things like the mobs agro range, "social" qualities, and faction happen before or after the itemization step?]</i> <br><br>Typically yes, then items are created and placed as they fit into the context of the previously laid foundation. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyway, if indeed itemization is the last step for t'deep, ask that team to go back and look again - I think they missed a few things...]</i> <br><br>We'll look at the other issues you've brought up again when the guys are testing the itemization.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043646.html"><b>PoF Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well you fixed the fingers.. but obviously you didn't want to increase the total number of mobs in Plane of Fear. So what did Verant decide to do? Yeah, they removed 4 of the 8 boogeyman spawn.]</i><br> <br>Actually that's not entirely correct. In the Plane of Fear, there are a total number of creatures possible that can spawn. For each one, there is a percentage chance that a given mob will spawn. This means that the number of creatures of a given type that can spawn on a complete repop of the zone varies. For instance, it is possible that 50 boogeymen could spawn, just as it's possible that zero could, but on average it is usually a given number. <br><br>For the purpose of raising the spawn percentages for the frightfingers, we reduced the percentages of Phoboplasms (which can drop any of about 8 different class-inspecific items), not boogeymen. <br></UL>

The <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/indev.html">In Development</a> section of the official EQ page was updated today.  Here's the scoop:<UL><b>Zones</b><br><br>Two new areas tentatively titled The Hole, and The Warrens will be accessible via Paineel and Erudin on Odus. The zones will be free of charge and available via an optional patch. The Hole is a high level dungeon which represents the ruins of Old Paineel, destroyed long ago in a war with between the Erudites and the Heretics. The Warrens is a dungeon for lower level players, and is the original home of the Kobolds upon Norrath. More information regarding these new zones will be made available as their release date nears.<br><br><br>-------------------<br><br><br><b>General Issues</b><br><br>Though a majority of the EverQuest development team's time has been dedicated to creating The Ruins of Kunark expansion, we are now turning our attention to the enhancement of current game play related features, such as dungeon tuning and balancing, and quest implementation. Following are the features we plan to focus on:<br><br>- The Make Poison trade skill for Rogues will be updated.<br><br>- The retuning of Permafrost into a higher level zone.<br><br>- The retuning of Mistmoore and Gukbottom.<br><br>- Implementation of class-related weapon quests such as the Fiery Avenger quest.</UL>

I'm proud to announce that the <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/askthearchmage/05-19-00.shtml"><b>first edition of Ask the Arch Mage</b></a> has been published!  Ask the Arch Mage is a column where players can submit questions to Verant Interactive's Geoffrey Zatkin.  For those who don't know who GZ is here's a quick bio:<UL><b>Geoffrey Zatkin aka &#8220;Geoffrey Z&#8221; aka &#8220;GZ&#8221; </b><br>Game Designer<br>3 years at Verant<br>B.S. in Psychology (not computer science)<br>Works with the other game designers at Verant Interactive (so can ask questions around)<br>Specialty of the EQ Magic System<br></UL>Topics in this edition range from the Jammin Geoffrey Doll, to the portals in the Timorous Deep.  Even if your not a caster or hybrid you'll find it an enjoyable and interesting read.  Here's an excerpt:<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Naming pets is a cool idea, and one that we have talked about. There are, however, several problems. We already maintain a live staff that checks names as the go in. Adding something that let our staff check pet names as they come in to the world would be using too many real world resources for such a small payoff (adding more staff simply to let players name their pets just won&#8217;t happen). If a player could only pick one name, and their pet got named that every time would be more feasible - but that would mean that your fire elemental and your air elemental would both be named &#8220;flamtar&#8221; or some such. We would probably have to make pet names unique at that point - since we don&#8217;t want two pets having the same name for player recognition reasons. </I></BLOCKQUOTE>Once again I would like to thank Geoffrey for taking the time to do this column.  Thanks GZ! <br><br>Enjoy!

Gordon made a few afternoon posts on the Gameplay Board today.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043559.html"><b>Mobs in Dungeons, should they respawn?</b></a><br>There are certain areas where we've linked spawns in this fashion, however it's not on as wide a scale as advocated here. <br><br>Dungeons are designed to support multiple groups at one time, and this type of design would cause a few problems with that goal.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043325.html"><b>Monk Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The reward that "compensates" for the 14 pound weight limit, poor night vision, lack of equipment, ugly magic resistances, lack of damage until level 30+, player killing due to Feign Death nerf, 60-100+ hour quests, and dignity of being poor for most of a monk's life,,, namely, that we are not dependent on equipment, is almost out of the window now that they made our weapons way better than our hands.]</i> <br><br>Hey now, let's not forget the nifty monk-only weapons that have been turning up lately, and the fact that monks remain the best toe-to-toe melee damage dealer out there.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043193.html"><b>The Hero Complex</b></a><br>You've made some very good points here. Sometimes maximum efficiency isn't linked to doing the most amount of damage possible in the smallest amount of time. Sometimes things can take a little more finesse, and work out better in the long run. <br><br>Thanks for your post. I'll be happy to bump it back up to the first page :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043190.html"><b>Timorous Deep Drop Problems</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Unless I'm mistaken, mobs in Tim Deep drop no loot what so ever. No cash, no nothing...]</i> <br><br>Doh! <br><br>Actually I just checked with the Live team and they are almost done itemizing this zone. Assuming that there are no new items that require an item patch, it won't even require a server outage to bring the new data online.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043154.html"><b>Mez/Enthrall Line</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Recently, I have tried Enthrall on Aviaks, Splitpaw Gnolls and even a few treants. It seems all that gets wiped off the aggro list is me. After the enthrall wears off, the MoBs go right back to attacking my party members. This also happened when I was trying to save a low level SK from a Lioness in E Commons.]</i><br> <br>The Mez series has always had a chance to remove all or some from the hate list. At lower levels, I believe that it's a 100% chance. As the level of the creature goes up, the chance of an integral memory blur goes down. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043057.html"><b>Bugs Discussed</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The high level slowing spells (Togors, Turgurs, chanter spells) are still being overwritten by the weaker slow spells. It seems that spell stacking for the slow spells are reversed, that the weakest spells override the stronger spells.]</i> <br><br>This problem is known and on the list. It occurs because the "attack speed slowing" spells are the only ones where a lower number in the database is "better". We're going to give the programmers a little more time to address this. We also have an idea for a work-around that would make it work correctly. We'll keep you informed. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: The Howling Harpoon has a proc of Memory Blur, however when this weapon procs Mem Blur it procs on the wielder of the weapon...]</i> <br><br>That's not right then. I'll mention it to the live team. A fix should go live in the next item patch. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Just hand the Harpoon to the NPC before you attack, then loot it off him when you are done.]</i> <br><br>ROFL. I'd have to recommend against that :)<br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Actually these things need fixed as well as others.  The hate list bug where the mobs tend to remember the healers upon their repop.]</i> <br><br>Actually they aren't *remembering* anyone, they are "catching" the hate list from another NPC somewhere, and the healer just happens to be at the top. The team is looking into this. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: There is also a pet bug that I've noticed where (I play on a PvP teams server) my pet will end up attacking people in my group (even those on my team which I should NEVER be able to hit).]</i> <br><br>I've seen pets attack people in PvP situations who they should normally be able to attack after someone uses an AoE spell or something, but not as you describe. Any more info you can provide would be helpful. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: How about fixing some of the quests like Canabalize II?]</i> <br><br>"Fix" wouldn't be the correct term. "Put in in the first place" would be. The quest is done and is just waiting for a zone-data patch (doesn't require a full server outage) to go in. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Also, for us Barbarians, when is Verant going to remove the banker in Hallas from being part of the Rogue faction? Though I believe that a lot of bankers are crooks in real life, can you imagine that the good people of Hallas would settle for that? I do not.]</i> <br><br>I've spoken with the faction guy about this. We're considering it, but in the mean time we'd recommend that players doing quests in Halas work to keep their factions balanced by performing quests for both guilds.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041069.html"><b>Procs Erase Typing in Battle?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I realy hope this is a bug and not intentional, if it is intentional, what possible purpose does it serve? It is very frustrating to have crutial phrases like "heal me", "mez zealot!", "assist Nuggin!" and "we are screwed, zone!" constantly dissapearing mid-way through typing due to weapon proc.]</i> <br><br>It probably wouldn't be right to call it a bug, but rather an unintentional design consequence. I'll ask around to see if this is something that could be easily changed or whether it is something that's too far in to change at this point. It's something that I've found annoying as well, along with text editing on the text bar.</UL>

Keiote' sent me the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>With the lack of Innoruuk's presence on Norrath, the Teir'Dal<br>quest for more of their father and creator. Away in the plane of Hate,<br>Innoruuk battles the denizens of the light races as they breech his realm,<br>while on Norrath those of his children who have been blessed by him seek out<br>more of his power that has been scattered about Norrath. This brings us to<br>the present day and what the Teir'Dal call the "Age of Hatred".<br><br>             The known fact that dark elves were created from the limbs and<br>souls of the first Elven king and queen only fuel their hatred and drive<br>them to seek out more of their history. Complex and intricate details lead<br>the Teir'Dal to clues of a tome, the writing is said to portray them during<br>the Elder Age in which they have little knowledge of. Rallied by the leaders<br>of many Teir'Dal guilds, a small army of powerful dark elves gathers for the<br>worldwide search of this tome. The clues known to them often point to a<br>select group of light dwellers acting as protectors of the realms. It is<br>written that these "protectors" keep the tome of Innoruuk hidden away from<br>the searching eyes of Innoruuk's children, least the dark ones find and<br>learn what true power they may wield from what they find in the scriptures.<br><br>             A young prophet of Innoruuk, Saphyre M'yrrdin has foretold of<br>this group of  "protectors" and their intentions to keep the searching Teir'<br>Dal at bay. In the forest of Nektulos a forming army of Innoruuk's children<br>gather together in preparation to recover their history and what they see as<br>a way to turn the tides of war.<br><br>            Informants of the light races relay this news to the Protectors<br>and in turn the plot is revealed of the forming army of Teir'Dal and their<br>mercenaries. In the days that follow, the Protectors gather together and<br>spirit away the lost tome in hopes to keep the dark ones from ever finding<br>the power of their lineage. All across Norrath trouble begins to brew, for<br>the seeking eyes of Innoruuk's children hound the Protectors at every turn.<br>This brings us to the present and final search of the Teir'Dal. The<br>Protectors are just out of their grasp.<br><br><br>OOC/<br><br>In this quest their will be two armies of players, any light races<br>interested in joining will be known as the Protectors and act as the<br>guardians of the tome. They will travel together as one large army and evade<br>the Army of Hate until a final battle is declared on open and equal ground.<br>Those interested in joining the Army of Hate must be pure dark elven, troll<br>or ogre. In hopes to keep the battle fair to all, we will limit the amount<br>of players on each side to an equal number, this will depend on the response<br>of both the light and dark races. After the armies are set, the Protectors<br>will begin to evade and elude the Army of Hate at all cost. At each of the<br>first three encounters of the armies they will stop and choose a champion<br>for each (three different champions for each battle). The champion of each<br>army will battle unaided to the death. The winning champion of each battle<br>will receive a backpack of loot that he or she can distribute to their army.<br>After the third battle of champions, the two armies will take to the Arena<br>for the final showdown. This will be a battle of honor, if you are killed<br>during the battle you are asked to honorably sit aside until either the<br>light or dark army has won, do not enter the arena and begin fighting again.<br><br>    More details for this quest will be leaked to the public when the event<br>draws near.<br><br>If you are interested in partaking in this quest you may contact:<br><br>Princess Stexxy at <a href="mailto:RoyalHarmony@hotmail.com">RoyalHarmony@hotmail.com</a> to join the Protectors<br><br>Of myself<br><br>Keiote' Drak'Uben at <a href="mailto:darkmoon@graffe.com">darkmoon@graffe.com</a>  to join the Army of Hate</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Here's the latest round of quotes and excerpts from posts made by Verant Interactive's Gordon Wrinn:<ul><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043232.html"><b>Outstanding Kunark Issues</b></a><br>Go to: <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum1/HTML/002034.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum1/HTML/002034.html</a> <br><br>George Scotto, the Director of Customer Service for The Station is handling any outstanding Kunark shipment issues directly now. You can email him at <a href="mailto:gscotto@station.sony.com">gscotto@station.sony.com</a>. Be sure to send your station name and shipping address. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043218.html"><b>Level 50+ Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: No, I don't mean class abilities and such. Dungeons, items/loot, quests, that kinda thing. Like are any other dungeons going to get redone any time soon? Like Runnyeye maybe? Will there be any new items attainable by mid-levels? Quests...?]</i> <br><br>Absolutely. The next dungeon up for a bit of a revamp is Najena. As for quests, items, etc., those go in all the time and will continue to go in. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Though the majority of the posters here are in the 50+ club, the majority of the subscribers are not.]</i><br> <br>You are very correct. We are definitely concerned about the satisfaction of the lower-level players as well, it's just that the higher level stuff is getting a lot of attention right now. Keep in mind that it is generally the higher level folk that feel that they were running out of content, which is why they are probably more vocal than the rest. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043210.html"><b>The Posters</b></a><br>Brad and I are primarily the ones who post here, and to be honest we're trying to get away from replying to flames, as it appears that it only encourages more of them. There is a bit of a fine line though, for example, the last post that I made before this one had a subject line that was a flame, but the content was fine. <br><br>In most cases, I stop reading a thread when I come across the first personal attack or flame. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043215.html"><b>When will higher level tracking get revamped?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I know that you mentioned, Abashi, that it would be looked at. This was pre Kunark. Is it going to get looked at soon?]</i> <br><br>Actually both Brad and I mentioned that it was something for which we had no short term plans. It's one of those things that we wouldn't mind seeing at some point, however it's not on the radar at the moment. Should we place it on the development schedule at any time, we'll let everyone know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043202.html"><b>More on Weight Issues</b></a><br>I referred many of the weight issues, including the monk staves, to the live team yesterday. It looks as if a standard equipment template was used when creating the items, which explains why the same weight problem is present across a number of them. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041799.html"><b>Glamour of Kintaz Bugged?</b></a><br>Assuming that all of this information is correct, it does sound like there may be a problem. I'll get with GZ tomorrow and find out exactly what it is that this spell is supposed to do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043034.html"><b>Level 51+ Spell Dropping Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Later you admitted that "when you checked" (read: when you were playing on your own, and realized the bug 1) existed and 2) affected you), the spells weren't dropping.]</i> <br><br>Actually I didn't check it out with a play character, I popped a GM character into a dungeon, cleared it, and looked at what dropped, since people on the boards were insisting that they weren't dropping. I generally don't have time to check every issue that popps up here personally, as I'm not a tester, but I will do this when it appears that information I've received from other sources may be mistaken. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: What kind of company completely dismisses a bug report, fails to even check it, and insists that their customers are wrong? Because it's obvious no one bothered to check the drops when people reported the problem.]</i> <br><br>The best response that I can offer is that mistakes do happen, whether they be my mistakes or other people on the team. In this particular case, the spells were set to drop at a certain percentage in the database, but that percentage was below a meaningful threshold where people could "expect" to get spells. I'm sure that a few people did find spells, but not enough for their discoveries to be meaningful. <br><br>I do think that we've gotten better overall at recognizing, agreeing with, and rectifying these problems than we have in the past. The Alchemy example that some are fond of bringing up is a perfect example of one of our worst failures, taking months to recognize and rectify. Things since then have been handled on the order of days rather than months.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043092.html"><b>Voodoo5 and EverQuest</b></a><br>Our test department hasn't obtained one of these yet, however assuming that the card supports all of the correct APIs, there shouldn't be a problem. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043131.html"><b>A Random Incident</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Now, I have this great item, but I'm torn. The first roll, while with an incorrect range, came up with a value that matched a group member. I've seen situations like this for lesser items, but never really cared what happened. In those other situations, generally there was a reroll, but not always. Thus, I want to see what the community at large thinks. Was the right thing done? Should I not worry about it? Just so it's clear, neither of us could directly use the item, but I'm still left with a feeling of guilt over the whole thing]</i><br> <br>My personal opinion only, but since the roll came up with the number of a valid group member, I'd've let it stick. In the end though, it's up to you and the members of the group. It is nice to see though that you are sensitive to the feelings of those around you. It's things like this that really support the community that we are trying to provide.</ul>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon has made quite a few posts this afternoon on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043174.html"><b>Admitting When Wrong</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why then is it so difficult to at least admit the possibility that the design team may have erred when they did not give rangers ANY defensive skill increases post 50? Why can't you at least admit that perhaps the thousands of Rangers who are being pounded by enhanced Kunark Mobs while being condemned to having Level 40 Defense skills might know something that you and your design and testing teams don't? Why can't you at least check it out?]</i> <br><br>Because we sat down as a group and specifically designed out all of the aspects of the level 51+ skills and abilities. It wasn't an oversight, but something that we planned. <br><br>As for having "level 40 defensive skills", it doesn't work like that. Proficiency in a particular skill is not merely a function of skill points, but a function of level and stats as well. In other words, just because you stop gaining in one particular part of the equation doesn't mean that your proficiency hasn't changed. For instance, a level 60 warrior with 200 1HS hits better than a level 40 warrior with 200 1HS.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043177.html"><b>The Experience Curve</b></a><br>The experience curve from 50 to 60 is pretty steep, and we don't expect that everyone will reach 60. It was made this steep since the majority of the people at level 50 are very experienced players, and would tear through those 10 levels regardless what the curve is. The first person reached 60 in 17 calander days, with a ranger of all things, so it looks like the curve is ok. We really didn't expect anyone to be able to do it for about a month, so the players surprise us yet again :)<br><br>My recommendation to everyone would be to stop watching their experience bar and concentrate instead on exploring new areas and enjoying yourselves. You'll find that things go a bit quicker this way.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043178.html"><b>Philosophy</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: After listening to Verants own misconceptions about their game I've come to the conclusion that Verant doesn't actually understand their creation. Certain item are REQUIRED to be effective in the game. A lvl 50 warrior is pretty useless with a combine long sword, much the same as a wizard is useless with a low intelligence. Verant makes the drops impossible to get by the average player he in essense said you are not important to them. <br><br>I am tired of Verants arrogance. I began play within days of release. They have had great success so far, but over the next year and half many of their "Talent" will be working for other companies or collecting unemployment. There are many new games on the Horizon "one aptly named Horizon" that will be collecting my money instead of Verant. <br><br>The arrogance of your "Vision" is appalling. If you lacked your current success you'd have made things MUCH different than it is. You can lie and say it would have remained the same but it would still be a lie.]</i><br><br>If a person is concerned with their character being as effective as possible, they need to have the best loot and put in the time to get it. If they aren't as concerned with this, then they have other options available to them. <br><br>I don't really understand how you feel that this philosophy (requiring people to work to get decked out in the best gear) is bad. One of the main things that people asked for in EQ's design phase was for equipment to mean something, not only for it to have impact on how they fight, but they also didn't want to see everyone else decked out in the exact same gear as they have. This brings us back to prestige.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043130.html"><b>Keyed Dungeons</b></a><br>The keyed dungeons were thought up as a way to keep people from accidently entering areas of extreme difficulty, instead making it so they must specifically wish to enter the dungeon. It also has the added benefit of having people think twice before they choose to enter an area where the risk of death and possible corpse loss (due to the inability to raise a sufficient party to retrieve your corpse) is higher than most other areas. <br><br>By making it harder to enter a dungeon, players must make a real choice as to whether or not they want to absorb the risk associated with entrance. We also wanted to increase the challenge by getting rid of "zone fighting" in some of the Kunark Dungeons. Overall it's working pretty well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042805.html"><b>Necro Spell Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, I know that this isn't a major concern with the "live" team right now... but I would like to bring it to your attention. I play on the Team server Vallon Zek, and I just recently aquired the new Splurt Spell. <br><br>Today while fighting a halfling druid.. I attempted to cast Splurt on this Druid.. and I got a message..<br>"The spell did not take hold"<br>Tried again..... Same result. <br><br>After talking to this druid... turns out all he had cast on himself was Skin Like Nature, and Group Magic Resist. Now I'm not sure which spell was preventing me from Casting Splurt on this Druid... but later on I got a chance to test it on an unbuffed Druid.. and it stuck with no problem. <br><br>I'm not sure if this was intentional or not.. but I thought I'd bring it to your attention. ]</i><br><br><br>It's probably the hitpoint regen component on Skin Like Nature that's causing splurt not to stack. Splurt uses different code than most DOTs, which probably explains why others don't have this problem. I'll mention it to the coders.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042797.html"><b>Fixing /Random</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Isn't it about time that you guys got on fixing this? Random numbers are still generated client side and, as such, are subject to hacks. It shouldn't be all that hard to either fix the game executable so that it detects this or, better yet, make /random's a server side command.]</i><br> <br>/random is server-side. It was put on the server the same time that the color was changed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042221-3.html"><b>Is Grimrot Spawning?</b></a><br>Grimrot is spawning, he's just got a fairly long spawn time. I believe this was adjusted a few patches ago because he was spawning too frequently.</UL>

I spotted the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042635.html">following thread</a> on the Gameplay Board which contains post Gordon Wrinn created:<UL>Who are you to decide whats best for the game? <br><br>I think the people should decide whats best for EQ.<br>If melee want to bind themselves in the city. Let them.<br><br>If people feel that classes are unbalanced ask them why and make those changes.<br><br>It is the people that make the game. Isn't it?<br><br>Or you may not see people sign-up for Star Wars or EQ2 later.<br><br><b><i>Frankly Brian, as the designers of the game, we are the ones with personal and financial stakes in its success. Someone (or some entity) has to be the final arbiter of what is good or not good for the game, and it this case it is those people on the EQ tuning team. The people, those who choose to voice their opinion, whether on the boards, through email or feedback, or with their monthly subscription and the people they refer, do have say in this process, and we have implemented TONS of features and changes based upon opinions coming directly from the players. <br><br>This doesn't mean however that we can implement every suggestion we receive, or even every suggestion that the people at-large feel is a good idea. We are in the business of keeping our customers, all 217K+ of them, happy, given their multinational orgin, separate desires and expectations, even when those desires, expectations, and needs are in direct conflict with those of another customer. This "direct conflict" is best illustrated by the class-envy posts, emails, and feedbacks we regularly receive. <br><br>Keep in mind that for every class that is absolutely sure that they deserve some new upgrade, enhancement, or feature, there is another class that will feel that they are equally deserving of an upgrade, enhancement, or feature if the first class gets their way. People who have been on this board for a while will be able to attest to this, given that "nerfs" have historically caused less problems than enhancements. This is because when we "nerf" something, only the users of the "nerfed" aspect become upset, whereas when we enhance something, we often start receiving complaints from multiple other sources. A good example of this is when the hitpoints were upped on Paladins and SKs. This action spawned complaints from warriors, rogues, monks, rangers, and bards.<br><br>In the end, we provide a service offering, and if people like that offering they choose to buy our product. If they continue to like our offering from month to month, they choose to continue buying our product through the monthly subscription fees. We'll always strive to encourage you to make this choice, and will continue to listen to the opinions and suggestions expressed in this and other forums to do everything we can that is good for the game as a whole. <br><br>By "good for the game as a whole", I speak of customer retention. Since customer retention is directly tied to customer satisfaction, that is the focus of every decision we make. We believe firmly that people want a game that is challenging and provides some sort of reward for playing, which is why we are so firmly against suggestions that make the game too easy, or reduce the rewards such as by making powerful items extremely commonplace. This is a delicate balance, and though I am sure that we could make a number of people happy in the short term if we made the game easier, made advancement quicker, made classes more powerful, or made items more plentiful, the end result would be that people would become bored much quicker, and leave the game at a greater pace. <br><br>As for our customer retention, an excess of 70% after 14 months is unheard of in the industry, and therefore we are very proud of it. Certainly it could be better and we will continue to aim towards doing more things in game that helps keep people interested in the game. Given though that our customer have very different needs and desires as mentioned above, its very possible that some of the things we do along these lines will upset some customers while encouraging others to stay with us longer. For instance, a good number of people wanted zones that were much more difficult, being far more challenging than those in old EQ. A good number of the Kunark dungeons were built with this in mind. Of course, by doing what one group of customer wanted in this case most certainly has made another group unhappy. Only time will tell what the right decision was in this case, but we continue to believe that challenging and intriguing content is the best strategy to follow.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

EverQuest is alive and kicking according to a recent <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042909.html">response posted</a> by none other than Verant Vice President Brad McQuaid.  Here's the original post followed by his response:<UL>Guys, the ranting (while legitimate) is getting nowhere. ROK is out and that was Verant's last major hurrah. They're not going to change any class fundamentally even though rangers suck post 50 (not a knock, rangers; I've read many of your posts).<br><br>I doubt we'll see any new servers (server pop has actually fallen on most servers and the new ones are horribly underpopulated). They might retool some under-utilized zones, but I wouldn't hold my breath even on that one.<br><br>It was a good run, and the game will linger around like that mother-in-law who's only staying for 3 days, but Verant is clearly moving on. <br><br>It's an equation: put a skeleton screw on EQ and let the addicts continue to pay $10 a month (might lose 50,000); meanwhile, focus attention on Star Wars and gain 100,000+ subscribers. <br><br>Maybe Verant will surprise me and make some actual changes. Problem is, if they do make changes it will be of the Newbie-Guard variety. <br>Wow, re-reading this, they've turned me into a real cynic now :(<br><br><b><i>Quite untrue, actually.<br><br>Nobody from EQ is going to the Star Wars team.<br><br>The EQ Live team continues to pour their heart and souls into the game, making it better with each patch. The rest of the EQ team members continue to work on EQ related projects -- in fact, Kunark has sold so well that we're seriously considering a second expansion.<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn just responded to the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message_flat.asp?topic=5664567&page=2">Discussion Thread</a> dedicated to the <a href="/lore/playerviews">Player View</a> that was posted earlier today.  In the message Gordon clears up some misconceptions about the post he made last night:<UL><I>In regards to the news posting made today on the front page, of course I<br>meant GM and Guide *characters* are the ones that are excluded from being in<br>player guilds, and vice versa, not the person behind the keyboard in<br>general.  Once in a play character (which is on a different server from that<br>which they are a GM or Guide on), the GM or Guide is NO LONGER a GM or<br>Guide, but a player, and subject to all of the same rules and policies that<br>apply to players.<br><br>The authority of a GM or Guide solely follows the character that is flagged<br>as such. When in a play character, GMs and Guides are not permitted to<br>acknowledge that they hold that position on another server, in order to<br>avoid event he appearance of impropriety.<br><br>I do wish that we could get away from the idea that "someone must be abusing<br>their authority", unfortunately the only way to do this would be to bar the<br>GM and Guide staff from playing the game.  Considering that the Guides are<br>volunteer players, and GMs mostly come from the player populace, and<br>considering that everyone generally wants the GMs to play the game so that<br>they can stay in touch with problems that a player faces, this is something<br>that we'll probably always have to deal with.<br><br>I realize that there are some who believe that someone who is a GM or Guide<br>shouldn't be allowed to be in a player guild with their player-character<br>either, but we do have to draw some line as to what is reasonable.  What is<br>a guild really?  It's basically a group of characters who've decided to hang<br>out together in game.  There's nothing really "special" that changes when<br>someone accepts an invite into a guild, so there's no reason to bar GMs or<br>Guides from joining guilds with their play characters. As I mentioned above,<br>the only thing we could do would be to bar them from playing altogether, and<br>that just wouldn't be reasonable.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>Thanks Gordon!

Brennos Oakkeep has wrote a little piece regarding a recent post Gordon Wrinn made on the Gameplay Board yesterday.  I have posted the writings he sent to me as a new <a href="/lore/playerviews">Player View</a> and entitled it <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid958660199,57860,">GMs in Player Organizations</a>.  The article begins on this note:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>Gordon says:<UL><b>"...but GMs and Guides are not allowed to belong to<br>player guilds, and player's aren't allowed to belong<br>to GM/Guide guilds. <br><br>If you have any specific information, such as server,<br>names, etc., feel free to email me (gwrinn@verant.com)<br>and I'll be happy to look into it further."</b></UL><br>Ok, I have always been one of those Verant supporters,<br>but this is just flat out wrong or Gordon is out of<br>touch with what's going on and needs to hush up. I<br>don't know about GM/Guide Favoritism but I do know<br>MANY guides that are in guilds and know of GMs that<br>have been in guilds too. Maybe Gordon means with their<br>GM/Guide character, but I know they have secondary<br>characters in guilds.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>This is a very interesting topic and issue that hasn't received a lot of attention in the past.  To remedy this I have started a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message_flat.asp?topic=5664567&replies=0">Special Discussion Thread</A> on our Player View board to create a place where people can share their thoughts, comments and opinions about this issue.<br><br>A quick note, our fearless Boardbarian just implemented some new technology on the boards that should make navigating them even easier!<br><br>Thanks Brennos!

Gordon was back on the boards answering several posts and even creating a thread himself.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040848-2.html"><b>Item Weight</b></a><br>I'm having some of the weights on Monk stuff looked at today. In other news, Darkforge armor (SK) is having its weight lowered, and should go live the next time we patch items.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041816.html"><b>Ranger Issues</b></a><br>The whole ranger-defense thing is coming from the logic that: At 50 they are balanced. At 60 everyone else gets bonuses to defense, and rangers don't, therefore they aren't balanced. <br>The problem with this logic is that we don't balance classes on a skill-by-skill basis. We balance them as a complete offering. Everything that a class has is part of the equation. The fact that skill-point allocations, ratios, and percentage change as you go level to level is not in and of itself indicative of an imbalance. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041625.html"><b>Wind Saber</b></a><br>Bow's themselves cannot proc (randomly cast a spell on a successful hit). This item was probably supposed to be setup as a charged item. I've asked the Live team to check it out.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042708.html"><b>Frontier Mountains Nerfed?</b></a><br>We haven't retuned the zone. One thing to keep in mind is that most spawns have a level range that they can spawn in. For instance, hill giants can be anywhere from level 33 to 37 in most zones that they are found. <br>My advice would be to kill off all the blue ones, which will again give the higher level ones a chance to spawn again.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042549.html"><b>Buying Stackable Items in Bulk</b></a><br>This subject has come up several times in the past few weeks. As I mentioned before, this is something that we would like to do at some point in the future, but it's not something that we can assign a high priority to right now. It's certainly a good idea and a possibility for the future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042725.html"><b>Do enchanters have any hope of getting illusions past level 44?</b></a><br>No new illusions are planned for enchanters at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042731.html"><b>EQ on a 56K Modem</b></a><br>The majority of the data that EQ transmits is well within the capabilities of even a 28.8K modem. The notable exceptions to this are zoning, which will take longer with a slower connection, and very large battles (ones with a bunch of people involved in the same relative area, such as dragon runs), which may at times cause some data queueing. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042734.html"><b>Caster Items in Kunark</b></a><br>More caster items should turn up as people get around to the deeper areas of Kunark. Charasis, Veeshan's Peak, most of Chardok and Sebilis still haven't been explored yet. The other dungeons as well. <br>As people's comfort level grows, I think we'll start seeing the items turn up as peopel head deeper into the dungeons.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042741.html"><b>Items 'Morphing' Into Something Else?</b></a><br>We did have a morph bug about six months ago that would occasionally cause something to change into another item. In all cases I've seen of this, the item would change to something not at all related to the original item, since the process through which it happened was more or less random. For instance, I had a friend who's glowing torch turned into a pair of cloth pants. <br>Though it certainly may have been possible for something to morph from a silver ruby veil to a silver star ruby veil, my first guess would be that it may be possible that you bought the wrong veil and only noticed it now. It's very easy to miss "Star" in the description. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042829.html"><b>Hasten/Zephyl</b></a><br>We've figured out the problem with these two NPCs not popping/depopping. It's being updated on Test now, and will go to production when next we patch zone data, which will probably happen in a day or two, as a complete server outage isn't required.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040476.html"><b>Quest Armor Camp Time Excessive?</b></a><br>A 72 minute spawn seems ok. Quests for items aren't supposed to give instant gratification. I think that one of the problems we are running into is that when people want an item, they want the item NOW, and any time that it takes to get the item is considered a camp. <br>Things need to take time, or the prestige that comes with having is gone.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042832.html"><b>More on Spawning Time</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Now in a recent Post (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040476.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040476.html</a>) You claim the spawns are 72 mins? Get real.]</i> <br><br>I said that a 72 minute spawn on a particular NPC that the person talking about didn't seem out of line. In any case, I think a common misconception that people have is that everyone should be able to get every item. This isn't the way it works. There are things that drop in game once every few weeks, and are truly not meant to be common equipment for everyone. Certianly there is an element of luck involved (right place at right time). <br>Does this mean that people who play more have the opportunity to get more things? Yes. Is that something that should be changed? No. Everyone can't get every item. If that were the case, there'd be nothing special about getting a very nice item, and at that point we might as well sell everything on vendors. Players need to decide what items are important to them, and put in the time that they feel that that item is worth. No one forces anyone to spend 8 hours camping an item. People spend 8 hours camping an item because they feel that it is worth it. <br>The addition of some random loot tables in some areas of Kunark helps the "casual" player that you speak of even more. No longer do they have to track down one particular NPC, but only be fighting in that dungeon or area to have as good a chance of getting a particular item as anyone else fighting in the area. <br>Back to my point, there is no magic shot to make everything "fair" for the casual gamer, because you can always find someone who's more "casual" than the last guy. There's no way to make things equal in every respect whether people play an hour per week or 20 hours per week, and we probably wouldn't want to pursue it even if there was, as it would probably make the game boring. <br>The best advice I could offer to people in your prediciment would be to play the game first, and see what items you get, rather than deciding what items you want, and then playing the game to that end. Discover the items through your normal travels rather than scheduling your travels around items you want. You might find this path a bit more rewarding.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/000040.html"><b>The Hole</b></a><br>We're probably looking at sometime late June for a release of the Hole. There have been a few setbacks in its development, including the zone designer having a couple weeks of jury duty, followed by some meetings that the people working on it were involved in. <br>The zone geometry is done, and now it is being textured. After that we have objects, lighting, sounds, NPC pathing info, population, and itemization. </UL>

Five stars are awarded to the Ruins of Kunark in a recent <a href="http://www.gamesfirst.com/reviews/rick/Kunark/kunark.htm">review published by GamesFirst</a>.  Here's clip from this review:<UL>But the most obvious differences in Kunark are the big ones&#8212;like a whole new continent, for instance. With over 20 zones, many of them for higher-level players, Kunark is a sprawling and nasty place. A word of warning: be very careful where you tread in Kunark. Some of the zones are insanely dangerous, and even players in the high 40s have found it impossible to retrieve their corpses from the hairier zones. But there are some very nice hunting areas for mid-levels as well; zones like the Lake of Ill Omen or Warslik&#8217;s Woods are vast and provide good hunting for levels from 15-35 or so. Even better, the zones are so large and the creature spawns so prolific that camping is not a problem&#8212;at least yet. So far, you can always find something to hunt in Kunark. And from what I understand, the exodus of adventurers to Kunark has left many camps in the Old World open as well. </UL>Use the link above to read the article from start to finish.
