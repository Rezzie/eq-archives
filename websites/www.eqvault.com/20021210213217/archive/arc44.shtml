Some people were accidentally posting directly to the board rather than sending that information to us. It wasn't the posters fault, it was an error on our side. We've fixed the problem. It shouldn't happen again.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000069.html"><b>What About Us?</b></a><br>locke12 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have been playing EQ for about 4 months and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience to date. However I feel that there is a severe lack in EQ's interest in the early to mid level player. Everytime I turn around I see a listing somewhere for some new fantastic item, or a new neat spell, or a new interesting quest and they all seem to be designed around the 40th, 50th, or higher levels. I fully understand the developer's trying to keep the game interesting for the veteran players, but I must admit I feel left out. I see little or no development of new quests, spells, or magical items designed around the 10th to 25th level characters. Where are the new items, quests, and spells to make it interesting for our levels. If I see one more item showing up on the third party web sites that require killing some 50th level mob, or require that you enter the most diabolical dungeon, or traveling across 3 continents and camping for 40 hours I'm just gonna scream. I think it's time for the developer's to put stuff out there that us poor souls who have only been here a few months can look forward to. Something I can achieve with others my level. Not something I have to hope that some 54th level character is willing to sell for a mere 3000pp, which of course I have in my back pocket at any given time. Unless I'm not understanding the intent of the developers, I feel a little slighted. Sorry about the rambling. What do you think? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, our most recent addition was designed specifically for the level of character that you are talking about. The Warrens is exactly as you describe, a whole zone for lower level characters. Whatever impression you are taking away from reading web sites is going to be based on what the owners of that site find interesting. For the most part there will always be more 'hype' about the high level game and items and all that. That's what seems to interest people. Those that have characters that are of the level that they can think about getting that stuff are interested in hearing about it. But so are those that are looking ahead to what they might be doing later in the game. <br><br>That doesn't mean that we are not adding content for the early parts of the game, as you can see with The Warrens.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000065.html"><b>Crafted Armor & Magic Damage</b></a><br>WindigoA wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have a question about crafted armor being classified as "magic" and what that really means in terms of fighting a monster that can only be damaged by magic weapons. <br><br>I was fighting willowisps a couple months ago to get some extra cash and another light stone. I had noticed that throughout my fighting career that the boots I wore determined if I could hit ghouls, wisps, etc with kicks. Regular bronze boots yielded the INVULNERABLE message, while my crafted boots, because they were magic, yielding connecting hits that caused damage. On the flip side later I wanted to work with my hand to hand skill since I am supposed to be a fighting machine as a warrior. I had on crafted gloves that were classified as magic, yet everything such as ghouls and wisps that I tried to fight gave me the INVULNERABLE message when I tried to punch. If kick is a secondary skill but allows us to cause dmg to mobs if magic boots are worn, why is a primary fighting skill like hand to hand not able to share the same effect? I haven't tried this in a couple of months because I haven't seen anything in the patch message to tell me that this issue has been addressed! <br><br>When I petitioned asking if my equipment was bugged, I was told that they had no idea why a magic stat item that caused damage normally would not cause damage to items that can only be hurt by magic items. It was suggested to me that the programmers didn't want to infringe upon my monk friends by allowing warriors and others with hand to hand skill to hurt mobs that required magic weapon damage. I don't think this is a viable answer however since I've never been able to do more than 15 or 20 regular hit damage with my hands. <br><br>Thanks! ]</i></font><br><br>You're correct. Initially, fists were never hurting creatures that required magic weapons to damage. Special coding was added to allow Monks to cause damage to such creatures with magical gloves. It was not given to other classes because it is a special code for Monks. <br><br>Obviously the same thing could have been done with kicking as well, only allowing Monks to kick for damage with magic boots against resistant creatures. But Warriors use kick quite a bit, and so it was decided to let them kick for damage under those circumstances. Or it could have gone the other way. It could have been, as you suggested, that everyone with magic gloves could punch resistant creatures. <br><br>Either of those choices would have been more consistent, I suppose. But it's just a perk for Monks, really. It can easily be explained in game by the fact that Monks are skilled in the use of all their limbs as weapons and that's how they can use magical armor as a weapon. The Warrior only knows how to do so through practice with kicking and that he hasn't the skill with his fists to do so (and you'll find that it's probably true that few Warriors have much skill with Hand to Hand)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000070.html"><b>Darkforge Armor</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As of the patch,Darkforge armor looks exactly as it did before. From what I understand from some of my brethern elsewhere,you changed the look on Dark RUNED armor.<br><br>-Morgrist,Innoruuk server ]</i></font><br><br>You're right. It was the Dark Runed armor that was changed (just removed the tinting, nothing more), not the Dark Forged armor. <br><br>I'm sorry about the error in the patch message. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, I BEG you to ask the team to leave Darkforge armor alone. I have spent countless hours questing in Cazic-Thule, I have died at least 10-12 times working on this armor. You know why? It's certainly not the stats. Sentient is a million times better. Nevertheless, I don't want sentient, I wear Darkforge. Sentient looks like burgundy pajamas on my TSK. <br><br>Now, Darkforge, however... black plate, blood red boots, helm, and gaunts... it really makes us stand out. My proudest moment as a Shadowknight was when I finally got a set of DF bracers, and now had blood-red wrists. I almost started an Erudite SK the other day because of how awesome they look in a full set of DF. Please, I beg you, don't make it just plain plate. Clerics have gold armor. Roges have black armor. Warriors have blue armor. it goes on. I beg you, let us keep our individuality. <br><br>Ouze Stinkeefeets<br>34 TSK, Da Hui, Quellious ]</i></font><br><br>If the armor looks that cool, we'd be silly to change it. <br><br>The patch message was in error, I take the blame for that. I'm sorry that the miscommunication caused such concern.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000071.html"><b>Quivers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hmm I attempted this once and would like a reply. <br><br>Why do quivers not fit in the Ammo slot?<br>All I desire is that I can store my arrows, in a quiver, and actually get some use out of carrying it. <br><br>ATM I'm carrying a quiver solely for RP reasons.<br>In actual game terms I would be better off with a BP. <br><br>SO, if I could get a response regarding this? <br><br>Thanks Absor, <br><br>Arzosah Lorezhaz<br>Protector of Animals, <br>Worshipper of Tunare. ]</i></font><br><br>Unfortunately this just can't be done right now. Containers can't be worn, it's just the way the program works. I can't see that this will be something we can change, but you never know.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000072.html"><b>Coif Graphic</b></a><br>OscaDaGrouch wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Give Ry`gorr coif a graphic!]</i></font> <br><br>Short and to the point. :)<br><br>Well, we did&#8230; But people complained that they liked it better without one, so we took it off. This is another one of the dilemmas that we face all the time here. Some people really wanted a graphic and some liked it without. There is no right or wrong in a case like this, and there is no clear and overwhelming preference. So we're probably just going to leave it as it started out and not fiddle with it anymore.</UL>

From AllaKhazam:<BLOCKQUOTE>Announcing a new addition to AllaKhazam's Magical<br>Realm.  Now you can use the equipment database, with<br>its over 5,500 Everquest items, and list the items you<br>have for sale for each of your characters (for<br>platinum pieces of course).  This is a great way to<br>sell off items without going through the hassle of<br>/auctioning, and a great way for craftsmen to<br>advertise their wares to the rest of their server.  It<br>is also an easy way to find that item you have always<br>wanted but didn't want to spend the time waiting<br>around hoping it would get auctioned.  All of the<br>items for sale can be searched either by server or<br>right from the item description page.  No auctions and<br>no hassles. All you need to do is arrange through<br>e-mails for the time and place to make the trade. <br>Check it out at <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">http://everquest.allakhazam.com</a>.</BLOCKQUOTE>

I was able to gather these latest updates posted to the Developer's Corner by Alan:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000066.html"><b>Ring of Frozen Flame</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: ring of frozen flame effect serpent sigh from lord djorniariamar is broken effect still and the heat sight mask from velketor is still broken as well. Please fix this me and many other monks in my guild have to use our uv masks<mempo of likato> to see instead of a much niver face mask like enshrouded veil or others of our choice. <br><br>Sharun 57 monk fennin Ro ]</i></font><br><br>The ring is on the list of things to look into. The team is aware of it. I don't know about the mask. I'll let them know.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000067.html"><b>Roleplaying</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Since Roleplaying is such a hot topic right now, and since the love depth of the story, yet all the plot holes in the history of Norrath bug me... why not add more books with Norrath history in them in hard to find places in Norrath. Like how about some information on Past Heroes of Norrath. Or how Mistmoore relates into the Kunark/Faydwer relationship. Why does Mistmoore like it when you hunt in Howling Stones for example. Or The storyline of Dar brood of dragons... Or some information on the exile of Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen from the Claws of Veeshan. I mean when I say put these books of lore in hard to find places.. I mean anywhere from a vendor in Yelinak's Lair for Information on Dragons, to a new spawn in Crushbone that drops a book telling the history of the Crushbone Orcs. Also how did Frogloks become some of the richest creatures in Norrath? I think if the storyline was developed a bit more people whould find it easier to get into that roleplaying mood. <br><br>Laurana Highwind<br>58 Knight of Tunare<br>Crusaders of Plilo<br>Zeb Server ]</i></font><br><br>I completely agree. I would love to see more things like this in game. The idea that someone could find an old musty tome and discover that it's Mayong Mistmoore's diary, kept up until the day he, um, died is pretty interesting. I'll most certainly plant the seed and see if it grows. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000068.html"><b>New Servers</b></a><br>I'm not trying to single you out by responding to you this way. But I wanted to point out that we announce new servers as soon as we know that we're putting them up. I've been getting a lot of questions like yours, and I just wanted to let everyone know that we're not sneaking new servers in the back door. And prodding me with sharp objects, while fun, won't divulge any secret information about new servers. <br><br>When we've got one in the planning, we'll certainly let you know. I'll post it here. <br><br>And, well, I certainly hope that EverQuest Classic causes us to need more servers. That's what the marketing folks tell me is the idea of the whole thing. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000074.html"><b>Fan Fair</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: How are the preparations comming??

See ya soon. =) <br><br>- Mahkahl ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I sort of ducked out of any responsibility for helping to set up on this one. <br><br>/em looks sheepish. <br><br>I've been really busy with the new setup, so I haven't really peeked into how it's going. But I do know that a whole lot of us will be there. It's in our town, so that makes it very convenient. <br><br>I thought I'd take this chance to plug the event and to say that a lot of fun will be had by all. I'll see you there.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000075.html"><b>Foraging Improvements</b></a><br>Mshort wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: Little error on frontpage message <br><br>On the front website page, you have: <br><br>Skill Change <br><br>- Foraging changed so that if you are getting the hungry and thirsty messages, your next successful forage will always be drink or food. We have also decreased the chance of foraging fishing grubs a bit and increased the chance that you will forage water. <br><br>Unfortunately, this reads that if I get a "hungry" message, my next successful forage will be a "drink". Doesn't sound like a positive change. <br><br>You might want to change it to, "[....] if are getting the hungry and thirsty messages, your next successful forage will always be food or drink." <br><br>BTW, nice change lowering the foraged grubs. I always seemed to get twice as many of those than anything else. Really useless since I never <br>worked up the fishing skill (didn't need it -- i could forage!) <br>thanks! ]</i></font><br><br>That's what was in the patch message. Yes, it could be clearer (we've had several e-mails like yours). I'll send a message to the web team, and I'll make it clearer here. <br><br>When you are hungry you will forage food on a successful foraging attempt. <br><br>When you are thirsty you will forage something to drink. <br><br>Sorry for being a bit vague.</UL>

He had no idea where his corpses were (yea there was 2 of them), so he called me in. I used track corpse (nice work on this spell by the way.. it is great now) and found one of his corpses. He then consented me and I was told I did not have permission to move the corpse. <br><br>Now I understand that when there is multiple corpses in the zone a choice of which one gets selected. But why does it have to be different for track and consent. If it is the most recient then make it the most recient for all or if you want to go with the oldest in the zone fine. But one way or other be consistant with the corpse it chooses. ]</i></font><br><br>The corpse tracking spell and song look for the closest corpse with the right name. But you can only consent the newest corpse. I can see how this might be a problem. You could bring the person with you and have them loot or drag the corpses as you find them. <br><br>I can see the possible value of having the spells look for the newest corpse first. I'll pass the idea on to the team.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>Server Populations and Economies</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: a few questions... <br><br>(sorry for bad english :)) <br><br>I would like to know about a few issues... <br><br>1)<br>I'm not sure if this is for the Developer's Corner, well... . Could you please tell us what the average number of players is you think to be OK for a server. I am from Europe and at the moment, on weekends, there are sometimes about 1500 players on my server (Morell-Thule). There were 170 people online in Faydark the other day. The point is that i am concerned this amount is quite high for the servers, and I got a feeling there are some bad effects developing from this crowding (don't want to see the servers at peak-time though, more than 2000 people, geez). Besides intensive camping with long waiting lists there are especially quite rude manners in the newbie zone of Kelethin regarding kill stealing. <br><br>2)<br>It seems to me that there is a constant inflation of equipment (and money too?) in the game. Example: weapons and armor from Crushbone can be found at NPC-vendors in Kelethin. Equipment from monster-killing drops in price generally. Could it be this is due to the fact that there is no effective item sink balancing the amount of things? Is this intended to be as it is? Or am I even wrong? <br><br>3)<br>What is your idea of the development of the server population? As far as I can see the level of the average character will constantly grow. Doesn't that lead to a population profile with lots of highest level characters and unused newbie zones? Is it intended to be as that or is there a mechanism limiting the amount of people reaching a certain level (except their playing time)? ]</i></font><br><br>I'll just answer your questions by the number. <br><br>1) Actually, 1,500 is a pretty low number of people on a server. I can't imagine that this was a peak time number. If a server were to have only 1,500 players on at peak times, then during off times it might be nearly impossible to find a group. Though crowding certainly wouldn't be an issue, when the server population gets too low there is a legitimate concern about under population. Though with only 1,500 players on finding more than 10% of them in one zone would be shocking. That's got to be a pretty rare occurrence (not the number of people in Greater Faydark, that's number doesn't surprise me if a server has 2,500 people on line at the time). <br><br>With the addition of Velious (and in relation to your third question), I think 2,500 players on a server at peak times isn't too unreasonable. <br><br>2) I'm not an expert on MUD or MMORG economies, but I'll tell you what I see. Yes, there will be a decrease in the value of items over time in EverQuest. Items don't generally leave the economy. This was a known side effect of the decision to not have items decay or get damaged. For the most part, people don't really enjoy doing maintenance on items. It can become a tedious part of gameplay. And for item decay to really have an effect on the economy, to have it effectively keep prices for items stable, it has to eat up a lot of items. This upsets people and makes gameplay less fun. So given the choice to either have items decay (by whatever method) to 'help' the economy or having them remain as relatively permanent things, the designers of EverQuest decided that relative permanency was the better choice. <br><br>So the relative value of older items, ones that have had more time to become more common, will decrease as time passes. Debates have raged over whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, and they will continue to rage. Personally, I think it's a good thing, as an acceptable alternative to the other options. <br><br>3) Yes, there is a growing population at the higher levels on mature servers. Similar to the point about item decay, the only way to prevent this 'problem' would be to have levels 'decay' by some means. That's also not really going to be popular with players&#8230; <br><br>We've added content for the growing population at those levels. And that helps a lot. <br><br>But if you start a new character on even the oldest of servers, you will notice that the newbie zones are not empty. The influx of new players has been steady. Players that have played for a while will start new characters. People will try playing on a different server to see what the atmosphere is like there. The newbie zones aren't empty at all.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000053.html"><b>Stun 'N Spin</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have noticed a strange behavior that occurs when you happen to be turning in either direction when you get stunned by a mob. Rather than stun you, leaving you unable to move, you instead get 'stuck' turning and end up spinning around until the stun wears off. In most cases you will end up facing away from the mob, which can be fatal in the wrong situation. <br><br>This is by no means a priority, but it can be annoying when you are adjusting your view and happen to get stunned into a spin, and then have to spin back around before you can hit them again. <br><br>-Tairnyn ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I rather like it. To me it's like reeling from a blow to the head. The fact that you have to regain your composure and turn to face your opponent again seems like a good thing to me.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000056.html"><b>Trading in Velious Helmets</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I play a cleric who regularly fights in the plane of growth. As such, I have a cleric helm (with no graphic) from there. As this is similar to the quested armors, will I be able to get a graphic for this helm as well? <br><br>From my understanding, you have to "turn in" your helm to get a new one -- so maybe you guys overlooked this one, maybe not. <br><br>Seranthic T'sarith<br>53 Vicar (Coven Nex)<br>Druzzil RO ]</i></font><br><br>The smiths are only going to be accepting the quested helmets for trade in. We probably will not be adding a similar trade in for 'dropped' helms. It's a benefit for doing the quests right now. <br><br>Keep in mind that the smiths will not be giving your old helm back if you don't like the new one.

If so this will be a big problem.

I don't think assist should work until the person who is being assisted actually attacks. There will be big problems otherwise. ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, this is how it works by default. If you /assist someone, their target becomes your target and you begin to auto-attack. <br><br>If you don't want to have auto-attack start when you use /assist, you can turn that off in your eqclient.ini file.

I have a certain love for typing long messages myself. A long message will be read just like the short ones. But most people send short messages, so most of my replies are to short messages. <br><br>I'll admit that I do certainly prefer messages that get right to the point and don't get too sidetracked. It's also a little bit easier to respond to individual subject types, rather than a list of comments. If one thing on the list is waiting for some research or something, the whole response might be delayed a bit. So it is sometimes better to send us a few separate comments on specific topics than to send a long list. <br><br>But we look at everything sent in. And passing information to the team is a priority. So format and length are far less important than what you actually have to say. <br><br>So far the response has been great.

The zone is a lot more interesting than it was before, and a lot better in terms of gameplay. It's not perfect, that's for sure.

A new message is up on the Patch Server:<UL>April 4th, 11:30 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** EverQuest Classic Edition ** <br><br>There is a new package for EverQuest.  It's a small box with a small price.  Here's a bit from the press release for details:<br><br>---<br><br>SAN DIEGO, CA - April 3, 2001 - Sony Online Entertainment announced today that its classic edition of EverQuest(tm) is now available for the SRP of $9.99, a price point that will attract new users to a continuously growing community. EverQuest, the most successful massively multiplayer online role-playing game ever, will be available in both a jewel case and mini box versions at retail stores nationwide. "Newbies" will enjoy all the amazing aspects of the original EverQuest from creating their own specialized characters to embarking on perilous and excitement filled journeys across three continents.<br><br>---<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br>April 4th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** New and Changed Features **<br><br>- Guild Message of the Day.  Guild Officers and Leaders will be able to type /guildmotd <text> to set up a Guild Message of the Day (GMotD).  From then on any time a member of that guild logs in they will see the message with the name of the message sender added at the front, so you will know who sent the message.  Any guild member will also be able to read the GMotD by typing just /guildmotd and the message will be displayed again.  The GMotD will be erased if the server comes down, however.  You will have to reset the GMotD when the server comes back up.<br><br>- /assist changed and improved.  It should be much more reliable now.  It also will target whatever the assisted person has targeted.  The assisted person does not need to have auto-attack on for /assist to work.<br><br>- Fixed a problem with /corpse that kept it from working on corpses that were too far above or below you.<br><br><br>** Skill Change **<br><br>- Foraging changed so that if you are getting the hungry and thirsty messages, your next successful forage will always be drink or food.  We have also decreased the chance of foraging fishing grubs a bit and increased the chance that you will forage water.<br><br><br>** Spell Changes **<br><br>- Acumen now overwrites See Invisible.<br><br>- Translocate now has the proper spell gem.<br><br><br>** Bug Fix **<br><br>- Fixed many crash problems for Windows 2000 users.  This fix will most likely also aid some folks that are not using Windows 2000 that are having problems.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- Velious racial plate helm quests have been added that will allow you to 'trade in' your existing helms for ones with textures.  We have decided to allow the players (or their characters) to chose whether they wish to have the new helmet textures or to continue to use helmets that show no graphics.<br><br>- Five and ten charge versions of Potions of the Bone Field have been added.<br><br>- Kilva's Skin of Flame potion has been changed.  It no longer has the same effect as the Kilva's Blistering Flesh potion.<br><br>- Removed the tinting from Dark Forge and Resonant armors.  Tinting was never really intended to be on those pieces and, frankly, they look better without it.<br><br><br>** Miscellaneous Items **<br><br>- Reduced the 'bottleneck' for getting Howling Stone keys by increasing the availability of one of the quest items.<br><br>- Erudite guards will now be much less friendly to Kobolds.<br><br>- Vendors are once again selling the Coldain Tanner's Kit.<br><br><br>** 'Combine' container changes **<br><br>We've made a change to 'combine' containers.  In order to prevent people from accidentally destroying items, all containers with a 'combine' button will not combine any items that do not form a complete recipe.  This will be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath.  But this removes the only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks.  Their reduced weight and often greater carrying capacity made them more desirable as bags, with the compensating risk that you might just lose something if you made a mistake.<br><br>We will be increasing the weight of portable 'combine' containers somewhat.  Where some of these containers weighed under 1 pound, they will now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit.<br><br>Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks.  In case you didn't know, most tailor made packs have a built in weight reduction of 5%.  We are raising that to 10%.  We will also be displaying the weight reduction of all containers with the information shown on a right click.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

I do it, and I rarely see much delay (and I have the worlds worst connection at home). But if it really bothers you, and you have a lot of extra space on your hard drive, you can do what I've done in the past. Copy your EverQuest directory to a new directory. Have your shortcut for Test EverQuest run out of one directory, and play on the Live servers out of another. <br><br>I used to run out of two directories. But when I bought my new computer I forgot to set it up like that, and I've never really been bothered by the patches. If you are, then at least that's one solution.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000035.html"><b>Second Movelog For E'ci and The Rathe</b></a><br>Since there is still plenty of room on the new server, we will be opening a second move log for people to move from The Rathe and E'ci to Zebuxoruk. This will give those who missed the move another chance to get to the new server. We'll open the log at noon on Friday and close it at noon on Monday, so you will have the weekend to execute the /movelog command.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000039.html"><b>32 Bit Rendering Option</b></a><br>It seemed like a good idea to give this subject its own thread. You can read more about the video enhancements in the 3-28-01 patch here: <br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000004.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000004.html</a> <br><br>and here: <br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000002.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000002.html</a> <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Flareon wrote: <br><br>32 Bit rendering option <br><br>In regards to the new ability to change your color rendering to 32 bit depth via the eqclient.ini file... <br><br>I have a Matrox G400Max - when I switch my rendering to 32 bits, I can not see any of the 2D Bitmaps. <br><br>On the character select screen, I can only see the box with my character model in it, going in a circle. I can not see any of the buttons or the framing of that page. <br><br>With a little bit of luck and play, I was able to click the non-visible enter world button. Once into the world, I was able to see all the 3d models and every, but none of the 2d stuff.

If I change it to 24 in the eqclient.ini I have no problems at all.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, when you change it to 24, EverQuest ignores it and sets it to 16 bit. So that explains why that works. :)<br><br>The 32 bit rendering is an additional feature that we knew wouldn't work with all cards. But is certainly seemed like a nice feature to add for those with cards that could take advantage of it. <br><br>The Matrox card uses a slightly different memory arrangement than the cards we tested this with. We'll look into the Matrox, but we can't promise anything.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000041.html"><b>Guild Message of the Day Info</b></a><br>Yes, you got it. With the patch tomorrow we'll be adding a /guildmotd feature. Here's how it will work. <br><br>Guild Officers and Leaders will be able to type /guildmotd <text> to set up a Guild Message of the Day (GMotD). From then on any time a member of that guild logs in they will see the message with the name of the message sender added at the front, so you will know who sent the message. Any guild member will also be able to read the GMotD by typing just /guildmotd and the message will be displayed again. <br><br>The GMotD will be erased if the server comes down, however. You will have to reset the GMotD when the server comes back up.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000038.html"><b>A Change To Trade Containers</b></a><br>I'm sure we've all done it once or twice (or more). You start looking through your bags to see where that item that you've been carrying around for a month is hiding so that you can finally sell it. But instead of closing your tailoring kit, you combine it. Suddenly you've lost some stuff that you really wanted to keep. <br><br>Well, since EverQuest opened we've been warning you that this was one of the risks that you took when using lightweight trade containers for their carrying capacity rather than just using them for making things. <br><br>We've decided to make a rather dramatic change for the better when it comes to trade containers. <br><br>With this upcoming patch, trade containers will no longer combine items that are not a valid and complete recipe. <br><br>This means that if you accidentally hit combine, the container will not destroy your items. This also means that if you make an error and put the wrong item in the container while trying to cook something up, it won't destroy those items either. This will be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath. <br><br>But this removes the only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks. Their reduced weight and often larger carrying capacity made them more desirable as bags, with the risk that you might just lose something if you made a mistake. <br><br>So, with the logical change in the way combinable containers work (I mean, really, how often does a sewing kit eat a halberd?), we are also going to make them less desirable for just carrying stuff around in. We will be increasing their weight rather significantly. Where many of these containers weighed under 1 pound, they will now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit. <br><br>Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks. In case you didn't know (and I sure didn't), most tailor made packs have a built in weight reduction of 5%. We are raising that to 10%. We will also be displaying the weight reduction of all containers with the information shown on a right click. It seems that so few people knew about the weight reduction of tailor made items, even at Verant, that it seems that this bit of information should be shown to the players.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000042.html"><b>Planet of Sky Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Good afternoon, <br><br>I have seen the items in Plane of Sky get upgraded since the last patch (IE...if you turn in quest items they yeild upgraded and renamed quest rewards)....is there any chance of getting these upgraded items for those of us that have already attained the items? We worked just as hard as anyone currently has to for the items and deserve the same rewards. Any comment is appreciated...thank you. <br><br>Fitz AwlScyzes<br>60th Rogue of the Zebuxorcantspellname Server<br>Knights of Eternal Good ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I guess the first thing I need to say about this is that we made changes to items in the Plane of Sky several months ago, not with the last patch. I'm a bit concerned that people are only noticing the changes now. Hopefully the improved items will draw more people to the plane. <br><br>There is always an interesting dilemma when it comes to items like this. <br><br>It seems that most players want us to retroactively change items that we improve (or replace as a drop or quest reward) and to leave existing items as they are when they are made less powerful. Unfortunately a blanket rule for such changes wouldn't work out very well. Most of these item changes (at least the ones that make a stir in the community) are special cases, and we treat them as such. <br><br>Think of it this way. <br><br>Most people knew what they would be getting for the quest when they started working to complete it. When those people chose to do the quests (or fight the NPC) to gain a certain item, they knew what they would get. And they chose to do it anyway. <br><br>Keep in mind that quests can change at any time, either in difficulty or in reward. Just because something in the world of Norrath was one way today, that does not mean that it will remain that way tomorrow. <br><br>I have to admit to being confused about what this has to do with Haflingz though&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000044.html"><b>Velious Dragon Ring Teeth</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Is it true that you don't need to keep all the individual dragon ring teeth that you collect in velious? I.e. If you've got the one for Wakening Land you can destroy the one for Greater Divide as the WL one will work for both teleports? And if so, what exactly is the order that they're superceded in. (I think I know, but I want to make sure before I destroy anything) <br><br>Thanks. <br><br>Gavving Treewalker<br>Vallon Zek]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, the keys are&#8230; backward compatible. You don't need to keep the old ones. <br><br>If you want, you could try this for yourself by just leaving all but the last one in your bank and see what happens. I encourage you to try these things out in game, experiment.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000043.html"><b>Self Loot Messages Request</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I would like to put in a request to have the loot message that is sent to groupmates also be sent to the looter as well. I think this should apply while grouped or while solo, and perhaps should be switchable so that players who do not want to see their own loot messages can filter it out. <br><br>I can think of two situations where this would be extremely useful. <br><br>1. When fighting low to mid level armed mobs, the weapons that are dropped range from rusty to bronze to fine steel or velium. Rusty weapons just aren't worth the inventory space they take up in this situation when you might fill up on them and be unable to loot the FS later. With a self loot message, you could pick up the weapon, read what type of weapon it is and immediately decide whether to destroy it or put it in your inventory. There would be no delay in inspecting the item with a right click and hold, then a second click to pick up the item. <br><br>2. I have logging on all the time. It sure would be nice to be able to review my logs after a play session and have notes of what items dropped from what creatures. Months later, if I need to replace a particular item, I could use my logs to find out where it came from. Note: this would be even better if the loot message said what creature the loot came from, but that would not be required. <br><br>This kind of expands into another area I would like to see. I would like to have the ability to enter some notes into my logs. The /note command is OK, but there is no cross-reference between the note file and the log, so I can't do things like associate a note with a /loc unless I retype the coordinates. If I could get a note into the log, I could record a location with /loc and then make a note about an NPC at that location. Later I could search through my logs for the note and it would be right next to the /loc. <br><br>--- Geffin Dagrifter [The Keepers]<br>Wealth Redistribution Engineer<br>Level 50, E'ci ]</i></font><br><br>This isn't a bad idea at all. If the rest of your group gets a message that you've looted something, you might as well know it too. The basic assumption must have been that you would have already looked at the item when looting but, as you point out, that isn't always the case. <br><br>Perhaps having the /note command insert the time it was created would help out. That way you could at least compare times. I don't know. But I'll pass your ideas to the team.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000045.html"><b>Boards For Muses</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: With the elimination of the server boards, will there be a place for players to post their writings? For me, at least, reading a person's account of an amazing incounter or hearing about a funny incident was more useful and entertaining than the "go-here-kill-this-get-item" topics, or worse yet, the immature mudslinging that left you with a reason not to come back. It's easy to see why a change was made...but I so miss catching the rare gem of a story that made coming in here worthwhile. I, personally, would find a "Minstrel's Musings" board very nice...a lighthearted place to post(and comment on)EQ inspired stories, poetry and the like. All submitted for approval if need be. I realize it may be low-priority for you, but you've said that you're here for the players. So maybe you'll think about bringing back the fun of the Forum for those of us that play for the joy of playing. <br><br>Thank you for your time, <br><br>Larilei, Devoted Bard of Erollisi Marr<br>10th Harmony, Vazaelle]</i></font> <br><br>Harpy's Head Tavern is the place for in-character conversations and light-hearted fun. As long as it is kept civil and in-character, you should find the message boards there very much to your liking. They will be returning some time soon. Mennix will be shampooing his foot hair for the reopening, so it should be very interesting. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000047.html"><b>Voices</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I don`t know if it can be done, but if it were possibly and easy to make, can Verant add voices to some NPCs? I`m not talking to do a whole load of voices for every single quest they make or anything like that, but simple lines like "Hail!" or a couple of certain quests, let`s say, "Arh! Dark Forge...." and then just add the rest of the sentence this NPC has to say on the chat window. Anyway, just an idea that could be nifty.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, if you get up close to a beggar, you'll discover that some NPCs do have voices. <br><br>But the beggar's voice isn't exactly the same thing as your talking about. His speech is, basically, the same thing as a puma's roar. It's a sound effect, he's not responding to you by speaking. That's certainly a great idea, but right now we're limited by the technology. I'll look into this a bit, since you've got me interested, but I don't think we can have sound effects (that's really what an NPC voice would be) triggered by text events. I'll send this as a suggestion to the team and see if they can come up with a clever way to do it. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000046.html"><b>Firiona Vie's Background</b></a><br>link04 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: few questions <br><br>1.Why is firiona Vie the EQ "covergirl" if shes the daughter of a god when there are many other gods to the equal of tunare (mother of firiona vie if your not sure)im guessing that kunark wasnt nin planning 2 years ago when eq was developed and put out so how is she so important as to stand out,even when the kunark epic is over. <br><br>2.I'm sure warriors through Norrath will agree with my plee for information when i ask Why does some crafted armor add to intelligence and wisdom etc.? <br><br>just wondering about a few of those post back if ya want :)  please i need to know some of these things ]</i></font><br><br>Interesting that you should bring up Firiona. I just finished reading a story about our famous High Elf that suggests you might not be correct about her history&#8230; <br><br>Someone had to be the coverperson for EverQuest. Personally, I would have chosen Al'Kabor. He's far more intellectual, and High Elves are snooty, after all. As game players, readers, movie watchers&#8230; as an audience in general, it helps us to be more involved in a story if we can focus on and identify with the certain characters. Firiona and her group of adventuring friends serve that purpose for Norrath. <br><br>While it is true that the specific tale that was used for the discovery of Kunark in game was not written two years ago, Kunark was certainly part of the original concept for EverQuest. A lot of the game world was drawn from an existing game world created by some of the folks that started this whole thing (I think a lot of it was conceived by Bill Trost). The individual tales that have been written and used for certain characters might be new, but the world itself was part of the original plans and had its own rich history long before I ever heard of it. I think that's part of the charm of the game. <br><br>As for Crafted Armor&#8230; Magic items need variety in the game. I suppose we could make it so that all magical armor that a warrior can wear only boosts the attributes that help fighting. But there is nothing inherently wrong with having other attribute bonuses on them. It might please an Ogre warrior to be able to feel smarter than the average Ogre. It might make an Erudite magician happy to be a little stronger than his fellows in case he needs to show off his muscles to the ladies. <br><br>Not every piece of equipment will be created using a 'min/max' formula for class power.</UL>

A <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000002.html">few Direct X issues</a> were addressed by Brad McQuaid and Rowyl and the Developers Corner recently.  The following excerpt is a complete copy of Brad's post:<UL><i>Yes, we did make some DX intitialization code changes that should enable us in the future to take advantage of newer 3D cards and their feature sets.<br><br>There are a few problems associated with this code that are affecting some players. Addressing these issues and getting a new client up is a priority and we appreciate everyone's patience in the matter.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>Another important post in this thread was from Rowyl:<UL>RE: new features available as a result of the new DX initialization code.<br><br><i>Please note, these features only work with D3D, so don't try them if you are using Glide.</I><br><br><b>32 Bit Color Rendering</b><br>If your video card supports 32 Bit color 3D rendering then you can turn this on. Currently, the way to turn this on is via editing your eqclient.ini file. Look for the line that reads VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16 and change the 16 to a 32. Not only does this use 32 bit color rendering, but it utilizes 24 or 32 bit Z-Buffering (depending on your card) which improves the visual quality of many zones. Cards that I know will work are ones based on the nVidia TNT or Geforce chipsets, ATI Rage 128 and Radeon cards, and 3Dfx Voodoo 4 or 5 cards. There are others, you can check your video card manual or box to see if it lists 32bit color rendering as a feature. Cards that we know do not support 32bit color rendering are the Voodoo 1, 2, or 3, and nVidia Riva 128 based cards (like the STB Velocity 128 and others).<br><br><b>DirectX Texture Compression</b><br>This feature will work with any system or card. When enabled it will compress the textures at load time greatly reducing the memory needed to run without swapping to the hard disk. However, it will increase your load time, primarily between server select and character select. If you have a system with more then 128 MB of ram then you probably don't need to turn this on and suffer the longer load times. However, if you are running with 64 MB or less then this could help with your in game performance at the cost of a little extra load time. You turn this one on by editing your eqclient.ini and changing the line that reads UseD3DTextureCompression=FALSE to be TRUE instead. Also, note your video card does NOT need to support DXTC for this feature to work, however if it does you will gain a little more performance from it.</UL>Thanks Skip!

The topic he deals with is the recent decision by Sony Online Entertainment to close down the Gameplay Board and most of the official board system with it.  Here's a clip:<UL>Well, it's happened. The last straw has been placed on the camel's back, and Verant's teeming superhighway of thoughts and ideas has been condemned due to excessive roadkill. Okay... perhaps not condemned, per se, but undergoing some serious downgrading to an old, dusty mountain trail by comparison. Even so, now players are given the latitude of actually reading up on current issues without wading through the parade of Jerry Springer Show rejects to do it. I say more power to them, and for more reasons than one. </UL>You can respond to the editorial by following <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=10387034&start=10387034"><b>this link</b></a> to the discussion thread.

Length of text same as maximum permitted for tells, etc. <br><br>When members of the guild log on, the message is played back to them automatically. The message can also be replayed at any time by any guild member by executing /guildmotd <br><br>This is a very high value-added feature to guild life. It's a powerful and simple way to get 50 people to go to the same place at the same time for an event at short notice. Many guilds use message boards to try to coordinate and plan events (e.g. raids) in advance, but there are ALWAYS people who show up late or not at all for guild events because they didn't read the board, they didn't remember the right time etc. <br><br>It's been suggested many times and every time tons of your customers supported the idea as a great one, but it seems it just doesn't reach the right set of ears in VI. <br><br>Datalore<br>The Rathe ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, it has already reached the right ears.

I'm curious if the fact that it can no longer be worn in the backslot was a typo by one of the programmers or an intended change. <br><br>If this was an intended change, how can we get the shield to a class that will actually use the shield after this change with it being nodrop? <br><br>Thanks for the reply in advance. <br><br>Razzum<br>60 Warlord of OoP, Saryrn ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, the change was intentional. We most certainly should have announced it, I'm sorry that we didn't. However, as the item is no-drop, announcing the change probably wouldn't have made too much of a difference to those that have the shield. <br><br>We are not going to be transferring these no-drop shields. As a shield, it is one of the best (arguably THE best) in the game. Allowing it to be worn as a 40 armor class cloak was an error on our part, and for that we are sorry.

But the reality is that in order to add left-handed characters we would have to recreate the animations for all of those characters. It's certainly a great idea, though, and I'll mention it to the team. It's just that with the resources we would need to make this work, we could probably add a lot of content in other places.</UL>
