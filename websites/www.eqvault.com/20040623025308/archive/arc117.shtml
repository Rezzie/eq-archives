How often had he thought of his mother&#8217;s death? How did it happen, or did that really matter? How often had he himself brought himself to the brink of death doing something stupid on the plains or the northern shores? Maybe death would be welcome. He definitely needed a drink.<br><br>Minutes turned into an hour which then turned into two, and finally the Elders emerged. Aolis made it short.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Enjoy!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon was once again back on the boards answering questions and talking about many different EverQuest issues.  Here's the latest from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039068.html"><b>Buffing Your Allies</b></a><br>I understand your argument, however the only reason we were able to make the 51+ buffs as powerful as we did was based upon them not being able to be cast upon drastically lower in level. If you are over 51 and you wish to group with someone out of the range for some reason, you can feel free to buff them, however you'll still be limited to the 49 and lower spells. <P>Some of the 51+ buffs have serios increases to duration, with some lasting a full 2 game days. That's some serios power, and we don't want it being used to enhance buff-twinking.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039070.html"><b>Is Kunark in retail stores?</b></a><br>Yes, it is available in the stores. Until we can get the online store back up, that is your best option. Just make sure you pick up the box with the lizard on the front :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039072.html"><b>Kunark Items</b></a><br>This is another case where it is not our goal to make everyone the same. We don't want everyone of a given level to be clad in the same equipment. Equipment that is able to be widely used by a large number of race/class combos also encourage camping, something that we would like to see go away. <P>Restricting items by race and class works towards this goal.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039094.html"><b>Zone Misconceptions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Lavastorm and Sol A/B have some very small hallways, very poorly designed. Shrink is Verants fix for this, but only shamans have it and it only works in dungeons. So the hallways in Lavastorm really suck.]</i><P> You've got it a bit backwards. The zone was designed specifically to give you a hard time because of your size. That size, and the stats and abilities that come with it, isn't supposed to be without its disadvantages. <P>As for the subject of this thread, we did put in a shrink-anywhere potion, yes?<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039117.html"><b>Lure Series</b></a><br>You are missing the elegance of the Lure series. <P>The Draught series of spells is about fast-casting good-ratio mid-range damage spells. They let wizards deal damage in smaller chunks making it less likely that the target will want to play a game of eat-the-wizard. <P>For the elegance of the Lure series, please allow me to quote a section of your original message: <P><i>[Quote from original post: I've casted it quite a few times now and have cosistently gotten 640 damage]</i><P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039064.html"><b>Mana Regen</b></a><br>The mana-regen rate is constant regardless how much mana you have left when you start medding. I think what you might be observing is an issue with the resolution of the mana bar. For instance, I've always felt that the last 1/2 bubble took longer to med than any of the others.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039057.html"><b>More Iksar/Plate Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I was wondering is the inability for Iskar warriors and sk's to wear plate a matter of not having the skins completed yet, or as a further balancing issue? If so how is not letting us wear plate types armor explained?]</i><P> The inability of Iksar to wear plate is in the original design doc for the expansion. It's *not* a matter of skins not being "done", but because that it was specifically planned that way. <P>The reason that they cannot wear plate is that it chaffes their scales. But fear not, those same scales also give them an innate AC bonus :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039059.html"><b>Iksar AC Bonus</b></a><br>Yes, Iksar have an innate AC bonus based upon race. Monks also get an innate AC bonus based upon class. The Iksar monk gets both the race and class-based AC bonuses.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039062.html"><b>Summoning Mobs</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Wouldn't it make sense for mages to be able to summon mobs to them. I think give mages a spell line that allows them to summon(teleport) a mob to the front of them would not take a way from any other class and just make the game better.]</i><P> Doing something like this would have bad effects on the game. It would trivialize cases where creatures are meant to be encountered in groups when it succeeded, and would cause awful trains when it failed. <P>Though we apprecaite the suggestion, it really wouldn't work out well for EQ.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039055.html"><b>Fizzling Rates</b></a><br>There have been no changes to fizzle rates. If you've been following the boards here for a while, you'll notice that this subject pops up about every 3-5 weeks. The last time that I'm aware of fizzle-rate changes taking place was late beta when fizzles were made to happen less.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039039.html"><b>"Get Out of Jail Free" Spells</b></a><br>Nothing is meant to be a get-out-of-jail-free card. Even "Gate" has the opportunity to fail. Spells can also be resisted. Feign Death failing upon a successful cast is basically the same as a creature resisting your spell.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039023.html"><b>Shaman Spell Bug Report</b></a><br>I've forwarded this to GZ. I'm not sure what the deal is with them, the one with the higher slowing effect should overwrite the others. It sounds as if there might be a problem with whatever determine whether higher or lower numbers is better.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038871.html"><b>Realism</b></a><br>Realism must sometimes be bent in the interest of gameplay, balance, and hardware requirements. Not to mention that I think that people might get upset if we got rid of magic, and everything besides lions, wolves, and bears.... <P>(Say it with me) <P>Oh my! :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038873.html"><b>Balance and Fun</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Verant cares more about BALANCE than FUN]</i><P> We don't view these two concepts as mutually exclusive ideas. We instead believe that balance is necessary in order to promote fun, and thus the longevity of the game. <P>If all avenues to promote "fun" were pursued without regard to balance, we believe that people would get bored with the game and quit.<br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: How about, If all avenues to promote balance were pursued without regard to fun, I believe that thousands of people who bought this game would quit out of frustration and leave nasty posts about Verant's "vision".]</i><P> Absolutely. The door swings both ways. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Guess what, it's happening.]</i><P> But no, it's not. EQ has consistently gained subscribers every week since it was release. <P>One thing that I think most people understand about MMOG's is that people who leave them tend to leave because they are unhappy with something or bored. It happens, but unlike in singleplayer games where people can win them, then put them in the closet never to pick them up again all the while remembering them fondly, it's usually some event that causes people to leave MMOG's. This leads to unhappy people posting on the boards, and would happen regardless what the Vision(tm) was. <P>That's not to say that peoples complaints are invalid. They are far from that. Everyone has different reasons for playing these games and everyone has a reason that is at least valid to them when they quit. Though we can't apologize for the Vision(tm) itself, since it is what makes EQ what it is, we definitely apologize to those who left the game due to issues that we can all agree were bad, such as overcrowding or periods of excessive downtime. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038874.html"><b>Kunark Refunds</b></a><br>The refunds are being processed as quickly as possible and emails are being sent when that occurs. There's a fair amount involved in the whole process, such as verifying that the original order was placed and that it hasn't already been refunded. We appreciate your patience. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038928.html"><b>A Visit To Your Local Dungeon</b></a><br>Thanks for telling the story. It's nice to read these once in a while, and also nice to hear about people "doing" dungeons. <P>The aggro range is what it is due to the design of the tower. It makes the dungeon a little bit easier than we would like, but increasing it causes some really nasty trains. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038868.html"><b>Customer Service Editorial</b></a><br>I'd like to thank you for writing this wonderful editorial. Both the positive comments and well-deserved criticisms are well received.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038820.html"><b>Why can't NPCs tell us more stories?</b></a><br>Definitely a good idea. We do believe that the world could use more inert content (content provided for the sake of content). One of the concerns is that people often expect any talking NPC to lead to a quest. In the case that you suggest, the only purpose of the story would be the story itself, and some people might get frustrated by that thinking that they had to search for some keyword to get a quest. <P>The EQLive team has come up with some wonderful inert content ideas, and you should start seeing things happen soon.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038818.html"><b>Old Producer Letters</b></a><br>Links to the old producer letters are supposed to be listed at the bottom of the current one. I just looked at the one we have up now, and this was apparently overlooked. I've asked the web team to pop the links for the old ones on the page. Thanks for letting us know.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038805.html"><b>Artifact Questions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: ARTIFACT means that there is only one of these items in the world (server) right? How could an Artifact drop from a MoB that respawns then?]</i><P> The item that was recently found (a paladin sword) was marked as an artifact by mistake. It will be changed the next time we do items. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Can you give ALL No Drop items to NPC's?]</i><P> Yes, but it's meant to be for items associated with a quest. <P><i>[Quote from original post: If so does killing the NPC let you loot it?]</i><P> Nope. This was a nasty little nodrop transfer bug that we stomped sometime back. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Giving NPCs some items does leave that item on their corpse.]</i><P> It used to do this, I don't believe it does any longer. However it's been a while since I handed something to an NPC and later killed it :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038805.html"><b>Item Tag Listing</b></a><br>Here's a list of the current item tags as listed in the EverQuest ROK Manual Supplement: <P>MAGIC ITEM: This means that the item is imbued with magic. If this item is a weapon, it will have the ability to damage creatures which can only be harmed by magic/ <P>LORE: This means that you may only have one of these items in your possession at any one time. If you attempt to acquire another, you will not be able to pick the item up. This will check your bank account. <P>NODROP: This means that the item cannot be traded to another player nor sold to a merchant. However, you can hand the item to an NPC, which is necessary for many quests. <P>ARTIFACT: This means that the item is unique upon the server that you play, and that there will never be another one given out. Artifacts are usually earned through participation in dynamic quests that occur in game regularly. Artifacts however remain so rare that most people may never see one, much less own one, which is why they are called Artifacts of Great Power. <P>A Deities name: If a deity&#8217;s name is listed upon the item, it means that only followers of that deity may equip the item or use its effects. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038612-2.html"><b>Firepot Exploiters</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: To allow these early exploiters to remain bound in the FirePot room is unfair to Wizards, Druids, all melee classes, and every- one who did not receive their Kunark CD in a timely manner. It also sends the message that it is ok to exploit known bugs, as long as you do it quickly.]</i><P> We really don't have the capability to move everyone out of there all at once. For those who actually are bound in the room, I don't think that it will be very long before they change their bind points voluntarily. Also, I really don't think that it is fair to call those that bound there "exploiters". There's no reason to expect them to have known in advance that we didn't intend it to be like that. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037238-2.html"><b>Guild Tag Loss Issue</b></a><br>The guild-tag issue has been a very elusive problem, and we've been unable to duplicate it on demand in the test environment. The programmers have been looking for what might be causing it. If anyone has any way to reproduce this problem on demand, we'd love to hear about it. You can email me directly at <a href="mailto:gwrinn@verant.com">gwrinn@verant.com</a><P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038583.html"><b>Problem With Kunark Zones</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: There are lines...I can take a step backwards in places in FV and the mob I am fighting toe to toe will wander off(usually by poofing) and usually back to a pile of his friends I step back over the line and wait a few minutes and slam the baddie and eight of his friends attack. I know exactly where this line is. ]</i><P>Sounds like a pathing issue where the creature loses track of the best way to get to you, tries to run to a new patch, which ends up taking them out of pursuit range. The fact that they come back after you just means that you are back in pursuit range and are again a valid target. You don't actually leave the hate list, and aren't meant to. The pathing issues are something that needs to be fixed. If you can get specific LOCs of places where this happens (they turn around and run off), please let me know and I'll get them to the team.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037315.html"><b>Bad Paladin Piercing Weapons</b></a><br>The item database is huge and complex, containing tens of thousands of items. Mistakes do happen. <P>What's the name of the particular piercing item that has paladins listed? Also, if you all want to post items with blank effects, I can get those fixed pretty quickly.</UL>

Gordon's been at it again making more posts on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038833.html"><b>Simple Fix to the Killstealing Issue?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: A very simple way to fix this is increase the spawns. More often than not, I find that the people in my group have full mana and full health. The problem is, that we have nothing to do with this mana and health, because there are never enough mobs to kill.]</i><P> Increasing spawns does not decrease overcrowding, it in fact encourages it. If we keep increasing spawns as more and more people enter the zone, sooner or later things are going to break because there's nothing to encourage people to leave the zone in search of more fruitful hunting ground. <P>We don't want to encourage people to jump on a never-ending hack-and-slash conveyor belt, we'd rather encourage them to explore.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038832.html"><b>Finding Spells Beyond 50</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I've yet to see anyone casting a spell past 50 they didn't buy at their vendor. In almost 3 weeks of playing, I've yet to hear of a single post 50 spell dropping off a mob.]</i><P> I've got the EQLive team checking on this. I'll get back after I get the report from them. Just one note, Kunark has only been live for a week and a half :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038839.html"><b>My hard earned faction went from Amiable to Threatening!</b></a><br>This does indeed sound strange. Are you sure that you haven't done anything (quests, etc.) that would cause something like this? You seem to know your way around factions pretty well but I have to ask. <P>Anyone else have anything like this happen recently?<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038796.html"><b>No Experience from Blues?</b></a><br>This doesn't sound intentional. Is there any other information that you can give that can help us track the issue down? Is anyone else having the same problem? It's possible that we might have an unaccounted-for overflow somewhere due to to the size of the numbers that we are working with now. Any additional information would help.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038758.html"><b>Shooting Arrows</b></a><br>Shots with projectile weapons are allowed or disallowed based upon the delta-Z (Difference in the value of the Z-coordinant) of your feet versus the creatures feet. It was primarily done to disallow some exploits that are possible in the event that there is no control. The downside is that if you are standing on a hill, and for instance a sand giant is at the bottom of a hill, you might not be able to fire at it even if it is at eyelevel with you. <P>We could look into increasing the maximum allowable delta-z if that would be helpful.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038786.html"><b>Group EXP Screwy?</b></a><br>There are some limited cases where something like this can happen due to the way the group aggregate damage system works. Due to the way everything interacts, changing the system further probably isn't feasible. <P>On an opinionated note, it does seem like a bit of poetic justice to hear about melee types accidently KS'ing from casters :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038787.html"><b>Meshing Zones</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Are there plans in the works to add more content to the zones other than Kunark to "mesh" the old world with the new? For example, an NPC in Neriak that wants you to get something from a zone in Kunark, or a quest from someone in Overthere Outpost asking for supplies from "home".]</i><P> We are constantly planning an implementing more content, quests, items, etc. There are already many quests in that "link" the two continents. I've heard that there's even an Iksar prisoner in one of the old dungeons :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038683.html"><b>Feign Death</b></a><br>Well, I suppose pretending that you are someone else and convincingly pretending you are dead are two different things. <p>Really though, we didn't want to hand out Feign Death to everyone, and not everyone can have every skill, even when it's cool and incredibly useful (especially when it's cool and incredibly useful). When we started looking for a way for rogues to reduce their "hate" value, feign death was an option but we thought it would be cheesy to just duplicate another skill. That's how we came up with Evade.<p><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038033.html"><b>Spell Balance</b></a><br>These spells are balanced. I think that once people have an idea how they work, they'll pretty much agree. Until then however I'll leave you to debate them :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038156.html"><b>Rules of Conduct</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The Basic Rules of Conduct are agreed upon when one logs in. Period. Correct?]</i><P> Yes, that is correct. <P><i>[Quote from original post: These rules are in place to protect players from the abuse of the Basic Rules of Conduct. Correct?]</i><P> This is also correct. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Those rules, when logged in and playing EQ are a contract between Verant and the subscriber. Correct?]</i><P> Well, they are a contract between the publisher of the game (Sony Computer Entertainment America/989 Studios) and the player. Verant develops and operates the game for the publishers, who authorize us to set policy and enforce the rules of conduct. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Are players protected by the Constitution of the United States and the First Amendment "Free Speech" or are they in a private fantasy world, governed by the basic rules of conduct put into place by Verant and agreed upon by the player?]</i><P> The latter. EverQuest is a private service and as such is not governed by the Constitution which protects people from the government. By using our service players agree to abide by the rules of acceptable conduct that we require for continued use of our game. <P><i>[Quote from original post: If players are protected by the rules of conduct, and players file /reports and petitions about player abuses of the basic rules of conduct, how are players to know how many /reports or petitions have been filled against an abusive player?]</i><P> Players have no method of acquiring this information. It is for the private use of the EverQuest customers service staff. I have heard a few suggestions that we should implement something along the lines of a public Feedback system used by Ebay, but that would have the potential for abuse. <P><i>[Quote from original post: If players and Verant are in a contractual agreement when playing EQ to play by the rules of conduct. Is Verant in breach of that contract if "abusive" players are allowed to continue to play after numerous /reports and /petitions have been filed?]</i><P> No. We have specific rules for dealing with issues and define what exactly is entailed by the term "abusive". We typically need concrete evidence that the rules of conduct have been broken (such as a /report or the incident being witnessed by a CS rep), and then act, at our discretion, based upon the severity of the infraction. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038210.html"><b>More on Spectre Model</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Before, the excuse was used that enchanters couldn't get any more illusions b/c it would take too much memory to add another file to the global index. This spectre image has been added to the global file, and there is no reason not to give this to us.]</i><P> I think I might have mentioned this in the other thread, but the spectre model has too many poly's to have two classes able to create spectres on demand. System resources are unfortunately finite, and we have to keep EQ usable by people with Voodoo1 cards.</UL>

Several new posts were made by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board over the last few hours.  Here's a rundown of them all:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038373.html"><b>Iksar and Natural Hate</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Confirmed from a test server player that the only thing that Iksar monks lack is the natural haste that human monks have been given.]</i><P> No they don't.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038425.html"><b>Manaskin Bugged?</b></a><br>It's not bugged. Manaskin only adds a very small amount to the mana-regen rate. The resolution of each "chunk" of mana that displays when medding is probably too large to show the additional 10 mana/minute that this spell grants.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038433.html"><b>Ethical Debate about Online Store</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Has anyone else noticed that the online store went down THE DAY retail boxes hit the stores? And has been down since then?]</i><P> We didn't feel that it would be right to keep taking orders while the shipping problems were going on. The timing is coincidental. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Why on earth would Verant do such a thing?]</i><P> Because we didn't want to put more orders through the system until we were sure all of the issues were worked out. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Could it be that Verant is trying to force the players who decided to wait into the local software stores? Why would they DO such a thing?]</i><P> We wouldn't. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Because the retail ROK cost's $40, (but it comes with a brand new copy of EQ!!!) and Verant and their distributors need to move these things off the shelf]</i><P> I'm very sorry that you are upset about the store being down, but there is no conspiracy. We took the store in order to be sure that we could serve our customers better. The higher price of the ROK retail box has nothing to do with it, we'd rather you buy the expansion directly from us anyway. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Wonder how long the Online Store will be down....]</i><P> I just got an update on it today. Things are starting to look better, but we won't bring up the store until we're sure everything is working ok. As soon as we can give you an ETA we'll post it. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Harvey, the expansion IS a brand-new copy of EQ... you can either use the CD key to enable a new account, Kunark Enabled and all, or you can use that key to upgrade your existing account.]</i><P> Just to clear this up, no it isn't. The key that comes with the expansion can only be used to upgrade an existing account. The key that comes with the retail version can be used either to upgrade or to create a new account.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038712.html"><b>Balance Not About Equality</b></a><br>Though I do thank your for taking the time to post your opinion, balance is not about equality. It's not about making everyone able to do the same thing in the same time with the same amount of risk. <P>The equality that you suggest is incompatible with the concept of a class-based system with class-interdependence. There are a few games out there that support class-less system which you may find more to your liking. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038789.html"><b>Pick Pocketing Questions Answered</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Just wondering if you can pickpocket something that someone else is fighting?]</i><P> Yes. <P><i>[Quote from original post: And if you can would that not be about a the same as Ninja looting, except you do it before the creature is dead.]</i><P> Not really, the ninjalooting restriction primarily applies to special items. Since rogues can't PP anything but coin and the odd non-magical item, it's not really a major concern. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Oh one more thing is thier any way to tell if a rogue comes up and steals all the loot off of what your fighting... that is if he can?]</i><P> If the critter scolds him perhaps :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038365.html"><b>Equipping Weapons on an NPC</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: If you're going to nerf us, nerf us all the way. <P>Before the delay necromancer pet nerf, giving a pet a halberd, and then giving them a dagger would make the pet equip the dagger rather than the halberd.<P>This was because the pets preferred lower delay.<P>Now that their delay has a minimum of 30, they still seem to prefer low delay weapons. In other words, giving the pet a short sword, then giving the pet a halberd, the pet would keep the short sword. <P>If youre going to nerf, clip all the attached strings.]</i><P>It's not a bug. All NPCs use the same code to determine whether or not they will equip a weapon and what weapon they will equip. The fact that the lower delay doesn't work for pets doesn't change that. I'd recommend that you don't hand your pet a dagger after you give him the halberd if you want him to wield the halberd.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036020-4.html"><b>Shaman Spell Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: We get this spell at 29 and it now has a lock so you cant charm anything higher than 26??? PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THIS CAN BE USEFUL????? AND WHY IT WAS DONE?]</i><P> With levels going above 50, we had to put in code to catch caps that were controlled by the level ceiling before. One of these was a safety net for charm, which caught this spell. Assuming that they don't have it already (my spell list is dated), we'll be giving Shaman the higher level animal charm spell with a higher cap. <P>I apologize for this not being in the patch message.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038074-3.html"><b>Level 51+ buffs do not work on Players under 39?</b></a><br>One of the limiting factors on what spells could do before was based upon what it would do if used as a twinking mechanism. The level 49 spells put us right up against this ceiling. When we created the new buffs, we decided to put the cut-off. You can still use your level 49 series on people a ways below you in level.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038172.html"><b>Earth Elemental Damage Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: WHY does my level 41 EARTH Elemental HIT HARDER then my level 43 ONE?]</i><P>It's not a bug. There's more to the "power" of a pet than how hard it hits.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038342.html"><b>Play Nice Rules</b></a><br>There are a number of reasons why someone might choose not to group, and we certainly can't compel anyone to join one. For instance, perhaps this guy doesn't like Dark Elves? If he had been a high elf enchanter, perhaps the claim would make more sense, but it is nonetheless valid. There's also the possibility that you and he had some history making him unwilling to group. <P>In any case, it would not be reasonable for us to force people to group with other specific people, especially in the case of a 2 giant spawn, where the ability to split off and take your own spawn is just as viable. </UL>

Another new review of <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/reviews/rok_a.shtm">The Ruins of Kunark</a> was posted at GameSpy.  The final verdict is a 86/100 score.  Here's a clip:<UL>I have been playing EverQuest since Beta4 of last year and I haven't been this excited about anything Verant has done since they lowered the amount of experience you lose when you die. It will take players many weeks of gameplay to fully explore all of the twenty new zones, and the new race adds more color to an already rich world. The Ruins of Kunark is already fueling the fire of addictiveness that EverQuest started a year ago. The expansion was well-timed: Many players that left that game are returning to join their friends and investigate the new graphics and new areas. </UL>

PC.IGN has kicked up their own <a href="http://pc.ign.com/reviews/13953.html">review of Kunark</a> giving it a 8.5 out of 10.  Here's what reviewer Jeremey Conrad had to say:<UL>Since players can now exceed the previous level 50 limit, most of the new zones reflect that, and it is one of the things that hurts this expansion. As I mentioned before, while there are areas for characters of every level to hunt, its not very fun to have to run through an extremely hostile high level zone just to get there. People who start an Iksar won&#8217;t have this problem, as they start out near the lower level zones, but anyone else who is under level 20 will want to avoid Kunark until they are strong enough to survive the journey there. </UL>To read the complete review use the link provided above.<br><br>Thanks MadWand! :)

The next place to <a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/Reviews/Item/0,6,0-4078,00.html">review Kunark</a> is GameCenter.  In their review they award Kunark a 9 out of 10 rating, not bad if I say so myself.  Here's the traditional clip from the review:<UL><I>There are some issues with Kunark, however. The higher polygon count causes some lag problems in the new city of Fironia Vie. This lag is related to the CPU, video card, and the amount of RAM you have, and is not an Internet issue. Although the box lists 64MB of RAM as a minimum requirement, 128MB is a more realistic figure. The expansion was also released with some sound problems and noises are sometimes mismatched with some creatures. For instance, if you kill a saber-toothed tiger, it will sound like a human as it dies. Finally, the game could use some proofreading, as in-game text contains many spelling errors and typos ("Agressor [sic] Goblins"?). </I></UL>

Gordon was posting up a storm on the Gameplay Board as usual.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038301.html"><b>Iksar Can Wear Plate?</b></a><br>Keep in mind that "Plate texture" does not necessarily equal "Plate item". Rangers, for example, cannot wear plate, yet have a host of items out there that use the plate texture. This is primarily because the plate texture looks better when tinted. <P>Rubicite is a good example of a plate-looking item that is really chain.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038343.html"><b>No Level 49 Spell</b></a><br>There isn't a 49th level song at this time, and it looks like there might not be one. We've used the rest of the cool ideas that people had on the 51+ songs, where bards get two per level. I&#8217;m certainly willing to listen to suggestions though and talk them over with GZ. As it is now, we could throw a song together just for the sake of putting one in, but it wouldn&#8217;t be cool.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038348.html"><b>Wolfform Issue</b></a><br>Cros and Holly shouldn't be jumping on Druids in wolfform. I've asked the faction designer to take a look. <P>Cros and Holly are Protecters of Pine, correct?<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038299.html"><b>PnP  Addition Idea</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Can you add in that if a caster and a warrior is in an argument over a warrior weapon camp, that the warrior has priority over the caster? Chances are the caster has already farmed it a few times and saw how easy it is to sell so he keeps coming back, where the warrior is just trying to get one on his own. Comments?]</i><P> I don't think that we want to get into situations that we are policing camps based upon what drops. Camps are for whomever is willing to spend the time at them.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038290.html"><b>More Memorization Slots</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I'd like to be able to have more spell slots so I don't have to memorize spells everytime my buffs run out.]</i><P> No plans to do this. The limitation to the choice of spells available to you at any given time promotes strategy. Some classes have a harder time with this than others. Wizards, for instance, usually don't have a hard time making their choices, where enchanters (and necromancers from personal experience) will always have an ongoing debate as to what the best spell lineup is. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038176.html"><b>Why do other classes have a level 55 spell and Paladins don't?</b></a><br>Just checked my list. There's a spell on there. If there's not really one in game at that level, there's probably a typo. I'll check with GZ next time I see him.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038164.html"><b>Drops in Kunark</b></a><br>The updates that we made to item drop percentages and locations were not directly based upon complaints from people about loot being too comon, but rather economic reports that we run to determine the health of the economy and the rates at which items enter the world. <P>Basically, once we got 100K people over in Kunark, we'd have found the problems regardless, so it isn't the "fault" of the players who brought the issue to public light.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038169.html"><b>Compass Training</b></a><br>Well we don't have any way that we could easily implement skill-increase potential based on what is in your inventory on a per-skill basis. I suggest you train the skill up a bit. The way skill increases work is that they require a successful skill check before they'll roll for a skill increase. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038170.html"><b>Server Situation</b></a><br>There's really no situation that could cause everything on the server (including NPCs) to "hang" for an amount of time. If there was a network connection issue, PCs could lag, however NPCs would go about their normal business. If it were a server problem, it wouldn't affect everyone on the server, just everyone in a particular zone. <P>If the server were to have a problem causing the zone to hang for a bit, spells ticks wouldn't expire either. I imagine what happened in your case was a network problem. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038159.html"><b>More Communication Ideas</b></a><br>The Guild MOTD sounds nifty. I'll pass it around.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038138.html"><b>Hotkey/Mouse Problem</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I'm just curious about the fact that pressing the keyboard shortcut for a hotkey doesn't work while medding. Is this a bug? You can press the hotkey button with the mouse and that works fine. Is there any chance this could be fixed? My carpal tunnel syndrome is getting worse because of this 8-).]</i><P> Since we allow the buttons to be pressed with the mouse, I'll check with the client programmer to see if we can also allow the key to be pressed as well.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038145.html"><b>Faction Information</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I am a DE Agnostic Enchanter. I'm not KoS in Freeport, Qeynos, Erudin, and several other non-evil cities. Yet I'm KoS in FV. Why is this? It seems completely based on race, and not at all on religion. I figured that by being agnostic and not being able to do religious specific quests would at least allow me to not be KoS in both good and evil cities on Kunark. This seems unbalanced...]</i><P> Firiona Vie is an outpost built by the High Elves and Wood elves, who do not like dark elves (regardless of religion). I've seen some DE people who managed to get their faction with Felwithe and Kelethin up to the point that they could go in, but FV is a different faction, so you start over there. <P>Factions are based on four components: <P>1. Your race<br>2. Your religion<br>3. Your class<br>4. Things that you've done. <P>Any of those is sufficient to make an NPC dislike you. Just being a dark elf is enough in this case.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038147.html"><b>Quest Ideas</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Many items are NO DROP that, once something better is found, sit in the bank and rot. Example, Razing Sword of Skarlon, great sword, collecting dust. (this is just an idea for warrior ATM) For ALL races, make a 45+ quest starting with your guildmaster that will USE all these no drop items. So, you turn in the Skarlon Sword, Fleshripper, an item from sky, AND a sword from the gods, and you get THE BEST warrior weapon, period. None of this AWESOME l33t sword some newbie can win in a lotto in some zone, I am talking about a DIFFICULT quest to finish, that takes a LOT of time, and a lot of effort, and with THE BEST reward one can get. The same could be done for ALL melee classes. Every melee class deserves somethig for their efforts, the paladins got FA (which could have been a better sword btw, nothing in Kunark should be better, UNLESS FA becomes a quest component.) It would give a lot of classes something to drive for beyond the next level.]</i><P>We like this idea, but it does have a downside, that being that it causes people to want to go camp something outside their level-range. For instance, there is a quest for Rangers that requires the EBW as a component, and this was a frequent complaint when this quest went in. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038153.html"><b>Ideas for Communication</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Would it be possible, or difficult, to implement a way for members of a class to talk to each other over a channel (like guildtalk). I think this could be useful for players communicating with others in their class regarding quests, strategy, exchange of research components, etc. e.g. /class Anyone have any information on the spell call of bones?]</i><P> Blanket communication channels tend to reduce the sense of community in game, rather than enhance it. Instead of dealing with a specific person, and forming a relationship with them, it ends up pretty cold. This is somewhat apparent with zone-wide communications such as /shout and /ooc, however it's not as bad as a server-wide mechanism would be. In addition to this, there are some technical issues surrounding this idea (e.g. the number of additional packets to broadcast) which make the idea unattractive.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038084.html"><b>Splitting the Loot</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Every day, I get into groups with greedy master looters. When I master, I split after every battle and sometimes short myself just so the group gets an even split (i.e. if I loot 5 pp 4 gp in a group of 6 I /split 6). I just think it's fair.]</i><P> We did the loot items due to the number of complaints about the ninjalooting of rare and expensive items. Coin really doesn't fit this description, so the best suggestion that I can offer is that you only master-loot with people that you trust. <P><i>[Quote from original post: And yes, /autosplit is terrible. If you have 6 people, and the MOB drops 5 plat, 5 gold, 5 silver, and 5 copper, guess what happens? The looter gets 5 plat, 5 gold, 5 silver, and 5 copper, the other 5 players get NADA (because 5 coins of each type can't be evenly distributed among 6 members). ]</i><P>This was actually done based upon numerous requests from people playing the game in beta. They got tired of ending up with tons of heavy coin due to the magical splitting of it. If you are masterlooting, autosplit can work very well providing the person doing the final /split is aware that coins are not automatically reduced to even the split. If you are not masterlooting, an extra coin here, one coin less there, isn't a big deal and evens out in the long run.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038127-2.html"><b>Does Grouping Give You an EXP Bonus?</b></a><br>There is both an XP bonus assigned per kill based upon the number of people in your party, and it is also expected that you can take more critters in the same amount of time in excess of what you could do solo. <P>For instance, if a solo person can kill 1 blue mob every 2 minutes, then a group of two might be able to do 3 in that same amount of time, yielding 50% (plus the bonus) more experience per person per time unit.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038039.html"><b>Stats Clarification</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Before the release of ROK there was a post by someone on the Verant staff stating that basically EQ does not have the best stats system, and that the effects of stats have been purposefully minimized to reduce the the effects of twinking.]</i><P> I don't recall anyone saying that. What I do recall saying is that the reason we don't have any +skill items out there was to reduce the impact of twinking. Stats really don't affect twinking as their effect is scaled based upon the level of the recipient. For instance, a level 1 wizards with 200 INT has roughly 1 mana point more mana than one with 100 INT. <P>One other thing, I've seen a rumor going around that the effects of stats were drastically reduced at some point in late beta. Nothing like that happened.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038030.html"><b>Pronunciation</b></a><br>We're actually thinking about doing a pronunciation key. Here's a few. If anyone has any others that they'd luck to ask about, feel free: <P>Qeynos = `Key-nos<br>Kunark = `Coo-nark<br>Najena = `Nah-jen-uh<br>Guk = Guck<br>Ykesha = Yuh-`kesh-uh<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037815.html"><b>A Compelling Reason</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: This is NOT a class envy post. I just want to thank you, Gordon, for supplying us with the answer to the basic question of "what makes a class ballanced?" I, for one, think that you and Verant are using entirely the wrong yardstick to measure ballance, but at least I understand where you are coming from when you say class x, y, or z is in fact ballanced in spite of my opinions and observations otherwise.]</i><P> I respect your opinion, and thank you for voicing it, however it is very important that everyone is aware that balance does not equal equality in all things. The pinnacle of a good class-based system is interdependence, and homogenization of the classes doesn't promote that. <i>[Quote from original post: 1. Is there any available information as to how many characters of each class exist in Norrath?<P>2. Is there comparitive information as to the number of class-hours each class has since the game began (I know, this is a bit much, but I want to know if the 8.6% of the existing characters that are of class X are actually played or just hold twink items, etc.)]</i><P> We have access to the information, but it's not something that we'd generally release in a tabulated form. One thing I should mention is that we had no expectation that the number of characters in game would be spread across the classes evenly. This can easily be illustrated on the group level. For instance, there is no point of diminishing returns when adding warriors to a group. In other words, the benefit to the group that one warrior adds can always be doubled by adding another. Some other classes can't do that. For instance, adding a second bard to your group will not do as much as adding the first one did.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037931.html"><b>Monk Questions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi - Is the monk robe quest still on the 'fix list'?]</i><P> It's on the re-evaluation list still. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 2) The 'combine' attempt when all the pieces are assembled has a chance of failing. Since the quest is so expansive, perhaps the final combine can be made to not fail.]</i><P> As long as it takes to acquire all of the items for it, this sounds a little severe.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037950.html"><b>PK'd in the Bank</b></a><br>I've read this over, and chatted with the customer service folk just to make sure rules haven't changed since I guided on a PvP server, but there doesn't appear to be anything "illegal" here. <P>There's no rule baring someone from attacking you in town. The only thing that is illegal in regards to anything of this sort would be exploiting guard range issues, such as attacking someone in guard range while you are out of that range. If you get into a situation where the guards like your attacker more than they like you, it's feasible that you could be killed in town. <P>Here is sounds like they just sniped you while you were coming out of the bank.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036639.html"><b>More Hot Key Ideas</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: As any seasoned healer will tell you, the F1-F8 keys are a neccessity. Targeting your players with these keys are a must. Since we can heal pets i was wondering if it were possible for clerics to hit the Fkeys twice to target a mage's(or any pet class)pet. I also play a magician and i am able to target myself with F1 and then press F1 again and it targets my pet. I dont think this is to unreasonable a request. It would just make it alot easier to monitor the health of a pet in a group situation. =)]</i><P> It's a good idea, and I'll mention it, but I imagine that this might be a bit difficult to implement at this time. What the F-keys do is client-side, and the client really doesn't know who's pet is who's. </UL>

Just from patrolling the Gameplay Board this morning, I can tell that Verant's Gordon Wrinn didn't catch much sleep last night.  Not only did he post more, but he posted as early as 2:00AM in the morning.  Here's the Morning Edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037914.html"><b>The Gorillas</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The Gorillas in the Burning Woods are not animals.... Is this as intended? If so, why? There is absolutely no point for furthering the animal-line in the Druid's spell list if there are no animals on Kunark. To tell the truth, I have yet to find one creature that is an animal...]</i><P> Actually none of the Gorillas are animals as I recall, and I believe that these particular ones are undead.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037929.html"><b>Hide & Hate</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why doesn't hide wipe the hate list?]</i><P> Because we didn't implement it as an escape spell. It used to do this in beta, but it trivialized combat and provided too big of an advantage to those who could invis. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037959.html"><b>Timorous Deep Not Itemized?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: just wanted too point this out since i've not even been able to get a coin from a bandit]</i><P> No coin? That certainly doesn't sound right. I've sent it to the EQLive team for investigation. Much thanks.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037967.html"><b>Refund Problems</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: This might sound a bit harsh but I feel pretty strongly about people charging my creditcard for something they find out they cant deliver and then not refunding my money IMMEDIATELY!]</i><P> We apologize for any delay. We are processing refunds as fast as possible in the order that the requests were received. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037874.html"><b>Tech Support Number</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Is Verant going to add "a" second phone number to call now that the masses of subscribers have gotten way out of control for 7 technicians to handle? Trying to talk to a live Verant employee is like trying to talk to a live KROQ employee.]</i><P> It's one phone number, but it certainly is more than one line. The line rolls over to the next available technician.<P> The majority of EverQuest technical support occurs at installation time. Once people can get in game, only a very small percentage ever need tech support again. Certainly there are cases where that number and percentage increase, such as in the case of ROK, however the number of people that we have maning the phones do a very good job of keeping up with the load.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037887.html"><b>Ressurection Line Nerfed?</b></a><br>I've heard a couple reports of this (thanks to those who emailed me). No intentional change was made to this line, but I've forwarded to the test team to check it out. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037782.html"><b>Clipping Plane & Kunark Preformance Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: In a older game I used to play, (Wing Commander 3) it had a setting that made the game detect if the framerate dropped below a certain level. If this happened, the game lowered the grafics lvl automaticly to improve preformance. <P>I suggest that you implement something like this in EQ. Instead of lowering grafics, you could tell the game to stop drawing the last 1/3'd of the tree branches if the frame rate gets to low. As I understand, its the tree branches that cause the low FPS. And if you have 30 trees in the front 2/3's of your screen, then the only thing you'll see in the back 1/3'd of your screen is possibly the trunks anyways. So just have the game draw the trunks if the framerate drops to low. <P>I'd really appriciate some feedback on this idea. ]</i><P>Though we could probably have it so that the clipping plane automatically came in or the particle engine turned off, I suspect people would find this more annoying than anything. Our engine doesn't have the capability to automatically turn off features such as this.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037635.html"><b>Haste Items Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Since learning that +mana items are also subject to the level restriction and have a reduced effect at lower levels]</i><P> Actually that's not entirely accurate. You can only raise your mana with +mana items based upon the total base mana that you have. For instance, if someone has only 50 mana, and they don a +50 mana item, they do not have 100 mana. This isn't a function of the level, but of total mana. We won't let someone double their mana supply with +mana items. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Im wondering if permenant haste items fall under this rule as well. I know that the exe axe doesnt proc haste til level 30 so Im suggesting that permenant haste items like the FBSS and Mith 2H dont work until a certain level or have a reduced effect ]</i><P>Permanent-haste items do not share the level restrictions of a proc on a weapon.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037629.html"><b>Anti-Ninja Looting Idea</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: That way while one loot attempt could be explained away, if someone started clicking up a storm you'd know they were doing it and at least be ready. In the very least you could deny the ninja looter and maybe other people getting on his back before hand would get him to stop since he already knew he was busted and could only make it worse]</i><P> Good idea, but once the creature is dead, the system no longer has a list of people who have the right to loot the corpse other than the legal looters. Perhaps a message could be sent to them in this case, but don't you think people would get upset when they leave a corpse to lie and have to put up with 2 minutes of "Bob tried to loot a_bat's_corpse00"?. I'll ask around, but tell me what you think.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037593.html"><b>Iksar Warrior Pike-Quest Flaw</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: If there isn't a way to get a new Partisan's Pike (it's Lore Nodrop so trade or /consent doesn't work) Please put such method in the game. Like you ask tell your guildmaster you lost your pike and you will receive a new one (maybe even dropping a bit of faction because you are a disgrace to the guild).]</i><P> This is part of a growing series of "Chain Quests" in the game, quests that lead to other quests. <P>This is as it is designed. I'd recommend that people put their starting item in the bank until they get past level 5 and don't have to worry about their corpse decaying after a mere 30 minutes. Only the dedicated who have protected their items since the beginning will get the final item.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037609.html"><b>Human Monk vs. Iksar Monk</b></a><br>Previously, with only one class capable of becoming a monk, balancing the monk class on the basis of race was not difficult. However, the inclusion of the Iksar, with many different racial attributes, has made this a bit harder. <P>Infravision and regen make life much easier for the young Iksar, which leaves us with a need to validate humans as a monk class. In addition, monks are the only race that get an AC bonus based upon their race. This leaves them already getting one just by virtue of being a monk, and now another because they are also an Iksar. <P>In this case, we decided that in addition to including the expected XP and faction issues, we've also made it so that Iksar monks will not be as "good" at *being* monks as humans. It's not by a large extreme, but human monks will always be better at doing what monks do: dealing damage.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037587.html"><b>Make Summons More Useful</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Those summons would actually be much cooler if the bags and items we summoned didn't disappear so quickly after LD.]</i><P> Well we used to have them hang around if you went LD, however it became commonplace for people to LD out instead of camping in order to keep the items, so we had to change it to the way it is now. Extending the time they remain is unfortunately not feasible, as the servers no longer keep track of a character once they time out and are removed from the world. Changing the way this works would really impact how the core engine runs.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/022759.html"><b>More Music Equipment Wanted!</b></a><br>GZ is out of the office for the next couple of days, but I'll ask him about it the next time I see him.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037217.html"><b>Mosquito Wings</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: On the 27th I was able to obtain several wings for the newbie shaman quest for Iksar's. I camped for the night, and when I awoke the next day all my wings were gone and after hours of hunting mosquito's I was unable to find any wings in the loot.]</i><P> This was our fault. One of the guys attempted to make the wings stackable, but something didn't work out which caused the mosquito wings to become invalid. This caused them to disappear.</UL>

Gordon made an <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037784.html">interesting post</a> on the Gameplay board regarding the amount of people complaining about their respected classes.  Here's the post:<UL><I>I just got done taking a look at the first page of this forum. As I'm sure many know, each page holds 40 threads. Of the 40 threads at the time that I'm writing this:<br><br>13 are complaining about rogues<br>2 about rangers<br>2 about paladins<br>1 about wizards<br>1 about magicians<br>1 about druids<br>1 about enchanters<br>1 about necros<br><br>That's over half of the posts on the first page that basically consist of "My class isn't balanced, isn't powerful enough, isn't desired in groups, can't do something some other class can." or something along those lines. The other 18 posts are perhaps issues that we'd like to answer, but people constantly bumping the class-envy posts keeps pushing them down. That isn't fair to the people who have issues that we can and are willing to address or do something about. <br><br>I'm very sorry if we haven't been able to give everyone the answer that they are looking for in regards to their class, but being as clear as possible, notwithstanding current planned and announced enhancements, we consider all classes to be essentially well-balanced at this time. This means that we feel that there is a compelling reason to play each class beyond the desire to roleplay. It does not mean that every class is equivalent in offensive power, desirability to a group, or has some unique special skill or ability, just that there are tangible reasons someone might choose to play your class.<br><br>I don't wish to get involved in the unending recursive arguments that surround class-envy posts any longer (e.g. Explain how we are balanced, what is the compelling reason to play us, etc). This is all meant to be part of the discovery process in the game. Part of the process where everyone finds out what character class suits them. We can&#8217;t tell you what you should like about your class, and if there is no other way to convince to you like your class other than to start handing out enhancements, then we may be at an impasse.<br><br>If you wish to keep discussing these issues on our boards, it&#8217;s perfectly fine. We&#8217;ll read them and we may respond to some issues raised from time to time providing that the content is respectful and the answer would be of benefit to players as a whole, but we won&#8217;t feel compelled to answer class-envy posts regardless how many people comment in them. We&#8217;ll close the threads when they hit between 300-400 posts, and if the number of threads reach spam proportions (like the 13 rogue posts on the first page), we&#8217;ll start closing them before that. <br><br>It is not at all our intention to suppress anyone&#8217;s ability to discuss these issues, but we want to be sure that people with issues that we can address, and that we&#8217;d like to address, have priority on the boards. <br><br>Thank you for understanding, and I do intend to follow up on this thread today if content allows.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Here's today's edition of the Gordon Infobits hot off the pages of the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037846.html"><b>Damage Bonuses</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Is there any reason why for melees who dual weild, the level damage bonus is only calculated on your primary hand?]</i><P> That's just the way that it was set up for balance reasons. The enhanced melee damage is only applied to the primary hand, not the off-hand. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037739.html"><b>Tishan's Relocation = Mass Suicide?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well, I can't see the usefullness of group evac'ing a party to the middle of Skyfire mountains where numerous aggro 45+ MOBS are ready to eat your already HP and Mana depleted group for lunch. Gordon, please help us wizards see the point of this spell and why I wasted 19pp to only to get 6 honest people killed?]</i><P> Sounds like you might have gotten a bit unlucky with that cast. We'll check the destination and look to see whether we can move it someplace a little safer, but as a general rule I'd consider that spell a last-ditch effort to save the group without leaving the zone. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037687.html"><b>Why do snakes kick?</b></a><br>The skills that NPCs have are based on level and class, not on the model that they use. For instance, that puma that you are fighting might really be monk. I suppose that it might have been nice if we had a way to suppress the use of certain skills based upon body type.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037656.html"><b>Mana Regen Nerfed?</b></a><br>There has been no intentional change, however due to the number of people reporting it I'm not ready to dismiss it just yet. However, I highly suspect that the observations are due to a number of things, not related to the actual rate. For instance: <P>1. Perception: Mana above level 50 continues to increase at a rate much like it was before, however the mana regen rate does not increase on the same curve, giving the perception that it takes longer to med, even though you are still getting the same amount of mana back per tick. This is something that people also notice and claim as they level up or gain +INT/WIS/MANA items. They increase the amount of mana that they have without increasing the regen rate in a linear manner. <P>2. Watched Pot: The addition of Kunark has caused people to spread out more. The net result of this is that the ratio of people to targets has improved. Where a group used to be at full mana the next time it was their "turn" to kill a particular spawn, they are now staring at their mana bars while a surplus of critters walk by that they could be killing. <P>3. Placebo Effect: The "Placebo effect" also causes the "Watched Pot". Someone, perhaps due to one of the reasons mentioned above, perceives that the mana regen rate has changed, and comments on it. This causes other people to become sensitive to the issue, causing them to pay close attention to their mana bars, giving the impression that it is taking longer to regen. <P>4. Of course there is always the good old fashioned "bug", which shouldn't take too long for us to figure out as soon as I can corner the programmers :)  I'm looking into it this afternoon.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037731.html"><b>Loot Tables Changed: Who Gets Hurt?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Loot tables changed - Who gets hurt... Those that had delayed shipments. They should have stayed the same so everyone had the same opportunity... What about the people still waiting for thier CD's?]</i><P> If "fairness" is the main concern here, there's really no way to make these changes "fair". Certainly we could have waited until everyone (within reason) received their CD's, but the same subject of fairness would come up for those who have had their CDs and just now decided to make the trip to Kunark. <P>Yes, the 10s of thousands of people entering Kunark did bring a few loot issues to light. There were cases where loot was dropping in the wrong place, and it has in most cases been moved to a more appropriate location. We even had a few dragon/god items dropping on level 40 creatures (though at very small percentages), and the people who were there first certainly lucked out. Unfortunately at some time we have to fix these errors, and making it fair in everyone's eyes probably isn't possible. <P>Please, lets not look at this as people who got there later getting hurt, but perhaps as people who got there sooner getting lucky.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037615.html"><b>Killing Guards</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: It is getting alittle tiresome in Butcherblock trying to find a guard being that everyone is camped and murdered the minute they spawn. You can see the bodies of newbies at the guard stations because they were foolish enough to believe that they could get some back up there with a battle gone bad. Why don't you make the killing of a guard a faction hit that so that the individual is automatically KOS in good cities. That would curb this practice immediately.]</i><P> The goal was to have each city have a faction associated with it, making it possible for someone to upset one city and remain in good standing with another. In some cases it's apparent that this may not have worked just like we would have liked it to, and we're looking for different ways to respond. We'll probably look at making some of the guards a little less appetizing. <P>One thing to remember is that the goal of the faction system is to embrace the idea that no one really believes that they are evil. For instance, the dark elves do not think that they are evil, they are just uncompromising in their application of their morality. They probably feel that the high elves are evil.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037617.html"><b>Hot Key Problems</b></a><br>The buttons are a bit messed up due to a graphics file that went in last week. We've got it corrected, but it's a pretty sizable download (about 1.5 MB) so we wanted to hold off a little while. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037640.html"><b>Can Enchanters have Illusion: Specter? </b></a><br>Though we certainly appreciate everyone's desire to look "cool", we don't want to open this model up to player characters. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037564.html"><b>Good Loot Attracts People</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: However, with the coming of Kunark, most people congregated to Burning Woods and Karnor's Castle. Why? Because the loot was good.]</i><P> Well it's more of a combination of good loot, and the fact that Karnor's is the first dungeon that people find when they get to Kunark. People will fan out to the other dungeons as their comfort levels grow and as Karnor's becomes crowded. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Sure, Chardok looks very good, but a raid was done in TM and we found 2 staffs that were completely useless (like 7/38 2HB or something). Any ETAs on itemizing the zones? I'm rather disappointed that Kunark was so hastily finished and zones are not truly complete.]</i><P> Your assertion that the other zones are "unfinished" or "unitemized" isn't true. I'm not sure how much time you spent in them, or how deep you went in, but they are very well itemized. It will just take a little while for the masses to explore these zones and see what they have to offer.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037560.html"><b>Expansion Spells</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Aside from the ones that you can buy from Kunark vendors, where are these new spells? I heard Sky, but I know a lot of people that were there over the weekend, and they saw ZERO spells drop. Has anyone found them? I heard about a L60 mage pet spell dropping in Skyfire, but that is it. Could it be that Verant hasnt added them yet? This is ridiculous.]</i><P> 50+ spells are either obtained via merchants, quests, or loot drops. They are out there, but you'll probably want to make your way to an area that is a little more ripe with magic. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037561.html"><b>Who Ya Gonna Call?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: When we can prove the troubles are on Verant's side...can we do the same and expect a response?]</i><P> Of course, but the nice (and bad thing) about running a destination service where 25-60K people are connecting at once is that when we have a problem, we know it because we lose a good number of people at one time. We have alarms set up internally that polls the number of people connected and lets us know if a number of people drop all at one time. Aside from the zone server, where we could lose only a small number of people, any other error that we have control over would affect thousands of people. <P>Source services (such as ISPs) don't have that advantage (and disadvantage). ISP XYZ might only have a few people connecting to the EverQuest servers, so when they have a problem with the route to us, they only have that small number of people who call in. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037551.html"><b>What is balance?</b></a><br>Balance is about there being a compelling reason to choose one class over another aside from the desire to roleplay a particular type of character. It really isn't about relative power compared to another class, nor would we claim that that relative power is meant to be fixed from levels 1 to 60. <P>Offensive power is only one equation in determining "balance". Other factors are usefulness to a group, and special skills or abilities. For instance, though a wizard's teleporting capability does not at all affect their offensive efficiency, it does contribute to other factors of "balance". A bard gives up much offensive prowess in exchange for being a very desirable member of a group. <P>By "compelling reason", we mean that one class does not invalidate another. For instance, the monk can do more offensive damage at a give level than any warrior. Now, if they had the hitpoints of a warrior, could wear their armor, and carry as much weight, then there would be no compelling reason to play a warrior other than roleplay. The monks weakness opens the door for another class to be viable. <P>Now any time I speak about "compelling reasons", posts on the board follow along the lines of "Just what is the 'compelling reason' to play a [insert class here]." All I can say in all of these cases is that "compelling" is in the eyes of the beholder, and I would encourage everyone to find that out on their own. Our opinions might differ from yours, but we believe that there are compelling reasons to play every class in the game, which is why we consider them balanced.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037417.html"><b>/Yell Idea</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Would it be possible to change the 'Yell' command so that when it is used, the player's name turns yellow, or flashes, or something similar for a short time?]</i><P> Interesting idea. We'll look into it.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037416.html"><b>Advanced Communication</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Custom send groups. Being able to add friends from all guilds, or unguilded to one send, and vice versa, would make talk between friends far easier.]</i><P> We're still working on an enhancement called /ftell. When implemented, it will send your message in a /tell to everyone on your friends list. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037431.html"><b>Iksar and Qeynos Faction Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I have been killing Gnolls in BB for almost a total of 15 hours and have yet to see a faction change. I would thhink I would decrease to atleast threateningly by now.. but nope. Any general idea of how many hours I will need to spend in BB total to get good enough faction to enter Qeynos alive being an Iksar Monk of Cazic?]</i><P> Some factions have thresholds for how good or how bad they can get. I wouldn't be able to comment on whether or not it was this that you are hitting here (haven't checked to be honest, but wouldn't be able to say if I had), but it's possible.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037473.html"><b>The Timorous Deep</b></a><br>I'm sorry guys, but I really can't speak further about this issue until the zone is widely known. To speak about it further before then would be tantemount to releasing spoilers. If you'd like to bring it back up in about a month or so, I'll be happy to discuss it then.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037474.html"><b>Hacking an Account</b></a><br>I'm really not sure how to respond to the question. The only way that someone can "hack" your account is if they obtain your login name and password. We've seen many email scams sent to people attempting to gain access to that information, which is responsible for some "hacking", we've also a huge number of auction scams where "hacking" is claimed. <P>For obvious reasons, I can't go into our internal security proceedures, nor the investigation process. We know that your data is safe once it enters our facility. We really have no means to take responsibility for anyone who gives out there SN and password, but we nonetheless investigate claims. We won't knowingly let someone keep playing on an account that we know to be stolen, however the ultimate protection of the account is in the hands of each customer. </UL>

A new <a href="/lore/editorials">Editorial</a> has been published taking <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid957225171,83248,">another look at the Iksar Faction issue</a>.  Here's an excerpt from our latest editorial:<UL><i>With the addition of the Iksar race, there is much debate as to why Iksar are KOS to all other races. This is an attempt to address this issue by looking at historical events in our world to understand why the Iksar are KOS to all of Norrath. <br><br>OK. Look at the discovery of Kunark from this angle. When the Europeans discovered the Americas, they encountered Indians, Aztecs, Incas, Mayans, and more. The natives had established cities, especially the Incas, Aztecs and Mayans. You draw a comparison to Cabilis here. When the Europeans explored the new continent, they found a culture foreign and barbaric to them. They witnessed virgin sacrifices, the killing of a woman every morning to make the sun rise, the drinking of blood, and more. The Europeans did not say, "Hey, go board our ships and check out Europe. It's a neat place." The Europeans slaughtered them. It was very rare for an American Indian to travel to Europe and walk around freely. It was until the late 1500s/early 1600s before American Indians were taken to England under the guise of freedom (Read the factual tale of Pocahontas). What I am getting at here is that, Iksar would naturally be KOS in all foreign lands, at least for a long period. </i></UL>

Let me share with you the<br>answer I usually give: First of all, we are 'it' this year. There won't be<br>any other big online games coming out in 2000. <br><br>To top that, we offer the first persistent science-fiction world. We focus<br>on the social setting, but give the player the option to choose a<br>single-player experience in a multiplayer setting. We have created a system<br>where the player can enter at any time, and still have stuff to do. Our<br>first focus was to abolish the "camping" feature; the second was to enable<br>play during a lunch break without having to run around searching for<br>monsters - or someone to team with in order to conquer the monsters on your<br>level.<br><br>Other features at Anarchy Online Vault will include game information, news,<br>message boards, concept art, screenshots, humor, reader and community<br>participation features, humor and much more.  New content will begin to<br>appear in the very near future.<br><br>In advance of the activity that is sure to begin with Funcom's showing of<br>Anarchy Online at E3, we invite the online gaming community stop in at our<br>brand new Anarchy Online Vault where the excitement will be centered.  Enjoy!

Electronic Entertainment Expo, otherwise known as e3, is just days away.  Our parent site, the <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com">RPGVault</a>, discovered what a certain Vice President of company called Verant Interactive will be up to.  Here's Brad's plans for this event:<UL><b>1:</b> Mostly I'll be at the Verant/SOE booth talking to gamers and helping answer questions about our company as well as the two games we will be displaying there, Sovereign and EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark.<br><br><b>2:</b> UO2, but I'm sure they won't let me see it :)<br><br>I'm really interested in other MMORPGs being worked on, both on a professional and personal level. I really want to see where this genre is headed, not just so I can one-up my competition, but also because I'm very attached to this space as a gamer and excited to see how it will evolve. I'm also interested in checking out single player RPGs and RTSs, as well as any other hot new technology.</UL>The IGN Vault will of course be sending several staff members to cover all the action.

The refined and cultured blokes who run Voodoo Extreme just kicked up a brand <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/games/interviews/Hook_interview.html">new interview wtih Brian Hook</a>.  Brian, as many of you know, left iD Software last year to join the Verant Interactive team.  Here's an excerpt:<UL><b>Voodoo Extreme: First off, what are you working on these days?  Can you talk about your role at Verant and what kind of stuff you do on a day to day basis?  What's your team like?<P></b>Hook:  I'm currently working with over a half-dozen other programmers here on our next generation RPG technology (which is going to be used by Star Wars Online and other products).  This covers graphics, sound, networking, GUI, AI, scripting, you name it.  It's a very talented staff.</UL>

Mordaen sent in the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hiya,<br><br> Just a note I thought might be of interest. Blacksmithing of forged<br>items is currently broken due to the lack of "Flask of Water" in<br>Cabilis. What we Lizards have is "Flask of Bloodwater". Now obviously<br>somebody was being nice and naming items appropriate to the new City but<br>you can't make any items that require "Flask of Water"...Arrgh. You can<br>make Tarnished weapons and that is it.<br><br>Mordaen, Lizard Shaman of the 2nd rank.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
