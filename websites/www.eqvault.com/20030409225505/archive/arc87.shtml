Estimated duration of the <br>raid will be 6-7 hours. Sign-up is on a First-Come, First-Serve basis, of up to <br>40 people, each of level 47+. The raid leader, Zellex, has reserved the right to hold 10-12 places for the <br>planes management body. This raid is for those guilds or individuals who would not normally be able to <br>hold their own Planes raids (i.e. less than 30-40 planes level members). To sign up, <br>post your name (or names if a guild leader signing up their guild), profession and class <br>to the Council of Guilds forum at <br><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showMessage?topicID=25.topic">http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showMessage?topicID=25.topic</a><br><br>Before signing up, read the Policy and Loot for Planes Raids forum at <br><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showMessage?topicID=12.topic">http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showMessage?topicID=12.topic</a><br><br>Since the Plane of Hate raid requires a stone reagent for the wizard's teleportation spell, <br>all those wishing to attend MUST bring 50pp to pay for their part. The Council is not responsible <br>for guaranteeing that you make it to the planes if you do not bring your entrance fee. Also, the <br>Council does not guarantee that you will get any loot, nor do we guarantee that you won't lose experience. <br>This is a raid for the adventure of reaching the lands of the Gods, enter at your own risk. <br><br>For more information on the Council of Guilds, please see our Web site at <br><a href="http://go.to/karanacouncil">http://go.to/karanacouncil</a> or email Haemish at <a href=mailto:haemish@mail.com>haemish@mail.com</a> for details. <br><br>Haemish MacLennan<br>Clan Chieftan<br>The Silver Daggers</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Haemish!

Here's a few Labor Day posts from Verant's GOrdon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010707.html"><b>Feign Death</b></a><br>The change of Feign Death to its current operation happened many months ago. At that time it was preannounced on the boards, and discussed in detail for several weeks following the change. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010738.html"><b>New Patch Program</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: That new patch program is a Godsend... After running the thorough check once, it identified a bunch of corrupt files and poof... no more crashes to desktop or boots to server select screen at every zone =D]</i></font> <br><br>Cool deal! We'll have to get the word out to more people :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010632.html"><b>Raids on Solusek Ro</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Peak hours: Over 100 people in Oasis and SK, over 90 people in Lake of Ill Omen, over 80 people in Overthere,.....]</i></font> <br><br>And many other zones that support the same level ranges that are near empty. You can't make a case for a "crowded server" by quoting the number of people in an overly populated zone. We could probably remove 500 people from peak, and those three zones would probably have roughly the same number of people in them. <br><br>Simply, the zones are crowded because people would rather go to them (even with them being crowded) than somewhere else that isn't. There are plenty of areas for people who want to go places that aren't crowded. <br><br>That's not to say that population on SolRo *isn't* above where it should be. When we bring up the next split server we'll certainly look at SolRo as a potential candidate. However, there certainly *are* things to do that do not involve crowds on that server. After all, it is less crowded than some servers were pre-Kunark, and now there's many more zones out there.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010679.html"><b>Back Stab Broken?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I dont think this is right - why should one weapon with exactly the same ration be a much more horrible backstab over something else with the exact same ratio?]</i></font> <br><br>You've answered your own question in your post: Because the damage of the weapon is all that is used in calculating damage from a backstab, and the delay isn't taken into account. What you've described above is how backstab is designed to work, and it works correctly given that design. Indeed, a higher damage weapon of a given ratio, backstabs included, will typicaly do more damage than a lower damage weapon with a delay of the same ratio. <br><br>Of course we could get into damage bonuses on the primary melee slot and how they affect damage output, favoring the faster weapons, however I would imagine that two points of damage would offset that. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010685.html"><b>Ranger Issue Dead</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think the ranger issue is dead - play somethin else abashi aint listening]</i></font> <br><br>Listening, just not commenting any more. I've posted in several ranger threads since the boards were converted, and each post led to follow-up flames, personal attacks, profanity, and other things that are no longer allowed on these boards. Class-specific threads in general are very inflamatory since people are very passionate about what they play, so I'll probably not be commenting in those threads very much unless I can add something positive to them, rather than constantly telling them no.</UL>

While mainly dealing with Verant's upcoming MMORTS <i>Sovereign</i>,  thought people from the EQ community might be interested in what Verant's implementing in the sound department for their next projects.  The Seattle Times has published a great <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ptech/html98/loca03_20000903.html">article covering the recent recording of Sovereign's soundtrack</a>.  Here's the intro: <UL>Benaroya Hall hosted its first commercial recording last week. An orchestra of 100 musicians crowded onto the stage and produced a sweeping, John Williams-esque grandiose arrangement. <br><br>But it wasn't a movie studio that had reserved the hall. It was Verant Interactive, the PC game company owned by Sony. The 100-piece orchestra? Its sound was streaming into a recording trailer backstage where it will eventually be spliced onto Sovereign, a multiplayer PC game. </UL>Here's a second excerpt containing Verant's Clint Worley's final thoughts:<UL>"We want people to listen to the soundtrack when they're not playing the game," said Clint Worley, game producer at Verant. "Video games surpass movies in revenue. If movies have music like this, there's no reason video games shouldn't." </UL>Also of note, Jeremy Soule is the person who is composing this track.  He's responsible for the music behind <I>Total Annihilation</i> and the more recently released <I>Icewind Dale</i>.

Gordon "I don't need vacations or weekends off" Wrinn tackled a few new subjects in recent posts made today on the Gameplay Board.

However, we are planning on begining a co-sponsored information release program in the near future. We're still working the details out with our contacts over there, but we should be able to start giving out some info soon. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: goto bed your supposed to be on vacation]</i></font> <br><br>Well not so much vacation as it is "home for the weekend". My wife works nights (nurse) on the weekends and goes to school during the week. So I'm really just passing the time :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010577.html"><b>New Armor (Click link to see pic)</b></a><br>Mmmmmm...

The art used in EverQuest represents nearly 4 years of work for a team of artists. Going through and revamping all of EQ proper with updated textures would take roughly half that time for a full team. Now, if you are talking about a completely new engine, it would then take additional man-years of work by programmers. <br><br>New zone geometry, though not being possible for a platform that has to be backward compatible for people using the current engine, would have to match up in every way at every coordinate, so there wouldn't be much of a benefit there either. <br><br>Basically, it's not feasible because by the time we'd get EQ rebuilt in the suggested fashion, all of the next-generation games would be out, and we'd have an old game with a fresh look. We'd rather, when that time comes, have a new game with a fresh look.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010564.html"><b>Necros and Lifetaps</b></a><br>The resistability or lack thereof of any spell is subject to the immunity of the target.

This patch gives an option for a more thorough check (a full CRC check) on the installed files. In other words it should not longer be necessary for tech support to recommend a full re-install to people who are reporting strange problems. <br><br>The patch shouldn't at all affect gameplay, so there's really no issue with the timing for when it was put up. I'm sorry you are upset, but did this patch reduce your ability to play the game at all?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010560.html"><b>"What could we do to improve your game experience?"

Both of these mobs are required for major quests, they should not be placeholders for each other.]</i></font> <br><br>I do understand the desire to complete both quests as soon as one has all of the quest items for either. That said it's not really something that we're planning to change. People are completing both quests, and the items to be garnered from either are nice enough to warrant an added level of difficulty. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010233.html"><b>Boats</b></a><br>Even though he posted it in jest, Dranthor's reply is pretty much right on target. The length of the boat rides are indeed related to adding some realism to the process. If we'd wanted something akin to teleports from one continent to the other, we would have went that route. The second thing about class-interdependence is also right on target. If the boat rides are too long, you have a method at your disposal to reduce the amount of time taken for travel.</UL>

Here's the last few posts Gordon Wrinn made on the official forums before he left on holiday:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010504.html"><b>Camping, Nerfs</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Well guess what Abashi, the nerfs have only created more problems than fixed, with out things to solo, noone can do anything without a group and when all of teh groups everywhere are saying "I am full" then I WANT MY MONEY BACK! I pay to play this game not to sit around for hours begging to play from people i do not even know or people i do not even PAY TO PLAY!]</i></font> <br><br>Hello again Robert, <br><br>I hope that you'll appreciate my being blunt. I'm not really sure that I can tell you. The groups "everywhere" are not saying "I am full". The groups in 3 areas in the game, known to be heavily camped, are telling you "I am full". You might consider going someplace that isn't known to be heavily camped. You might consider trying to form a group of your own. <br><br>Also, considering that you are level 48, do you not have any friends online who will invite you to their group? For instance, most people jump on line, check the friends list, find out where everyone is, and go join a friend. Do you not have any friends who make room and time for you? <br><br>Last week you chose to do something very dangerous without the support of friends or a cleric and were upset when you died. This week you chose to go to 3 areas famous for being crowded/camped. You keep choosing to set yourself up for failure, and then cast blame upon the game. <br><br>The game is designed to punish people who run into dangerous areas ill-prepared. The game is supposed to motivate people to go places less crowded with more opportunities by only supporting so many people in a given area. The game is supposed to reward people for making friends who will bend over backwards for them. <br><br>The game is working fine in the situations that you've brought up. The best advice that I can offer is that you step outside the box and try doing something different from what "everyone else" does. I think that if you look around, you can probably find other people who went to Lower Guk, Karnor's, and Rathe Mountains that night and had the same problem that you did. Try hooking up with those folks and going someplace else. <br><br>On a slightly different note, make friends with people. Go out of your way to help others out. They'll remember it, and will make room for you when you need a hand. So often I hear from people who primarily solo from 1 to 50 or so and then get upset that no one will group with them for the harder encounters. No one wants to walk into a level 40+ dungeon with someone who is having their first dungeon experience. Grouping skills and relationships are formed early on.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010503.html"><b>More Roleplaying Server Issues</b></a><br>I really think that there must be more to this story. Any time I see something presented that makes it appear that the action taken by a CS Rep was so blatantly wrong, I have to question what really happened. Afterall, were it so clear when it occurred, there's no way that the person would have been warned. <br><br>You have the story quoted, so I'm assuming it was written by someone else. Please have the author kick me his station name at gwrinn@verant.com. I'd like to look into it.<br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When the forum_faq came out and I saw they'd removed the initials for Role Play, calling EverQuest a MMOG (as opposed to MMORPG), it just confirmed what I already knew]</i></font> <br><br>You're reading a bit too much into it. <br><br>And MMOG is just a broader description of what we make. Yes, EverQuest is an MMORPG. Sovereign will be a MMORTS. We have a MMOAG (action game) in development that we haven't announced yet (other than the fact that we have one in development). We have a couple other MMORPGs in development as well. Whether MMORPG, MMORTS, MMOAG, or MMO-anything, they are all MMOGs, and that's what we do.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010497.html"><b>New Server Debate</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Items become more common, high levels become more common, and everything begins to lose it's value, especially gameplay.]</i></font> <br><br>The last two "new" servers are still hanging around 1400-1500 users at peak (Morrell and Torvonnilus I believe). These environments are still pretty young when compared to some of the original servers. You might consider trying them out. <br><br>I am surprised to see the quote above. We've been saying for a long time that the presitige and fun garnered from acquiring an item is inversely proportional to it's availability. It is nice to see that someone agrees :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010379.html"><b>Ports On Single Players</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi... is it possible to make ports castable on single players?]</i></font> <br><br>It is possible to do this, however it's not really what we had in mind for teleportation. Wizards and Druids are supposed to take others to the destination, not send them to the destination. The power of teleportation is in the druid/wizard, and they just have the ability to extend their aura, if you will, to include others. <br><br>It's not likely that we would implement this.</UL>

While mostly focusing on Ultima Online's volunteer policies, I thought it might be interesting to point out <a href="http://avault.com/articles/getarticle.asp?name=smurfs">AVault's recent article</a> on the effects an AOL lawsuit is having on the MMORPG genre.  For those who haven't been following it, this exceprt will help bring you up to speed:<UL>No one is more reliant on volunteer labor than the massively multiplayer online games. The three largest online fantasy role-playing titles, EverQuest, Ultima Online and Asheron's Call, use them as their first line of customer service. But maybe not for long. On Monday, August 28, representatives of Ultima Online's makers, Origin Systems Inc. (OSI), announced the termination of free game account privileges for hundreds of community volunteers. In a letter to the community, external support coordinator Matt Gutierrez wrote: "Due to changes in the industry regarding volunteers, effective Sept. 30, 2000, OSI will no longer provide free player accounts or other added value to members of all [Ultima Online] Volunteer Programs." <br><br>While company representatives have not said so outright, it appears the move to eliminate what amounted to a $10 a month gratuity for volunteers is related to a recent New York class action lawsuit, brought by former volunteers at America Online (AOL). The plaintiffs are claiming that AOL's practice of relying on what it calls "community leaders" to produce, maintain and moderate online content was tantamount to employment, and hence is covered by American minimum wage laws. (Origin's parent company, Electronic Arts, has exclusive rights to AOL game content.) </UL>

Overall I think it's been a real boon for communication.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010400.html"><b>/Rand Can Be Hacked?</b></a><br>I'm not sure when this happened, but you might want to look very close to whatever text string was coming up and compare that to the real thing. People usually use a long /say or /emote to give the impression of a /random. The programmers have made /random 100% serverside, which means that it cannot be hacked.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010320.html"><b>Rogue's Weapons</b></a><br>Dazzler, there's nothing wrong with the weapons usable by rogues. As for that caster weapon you mentioned, it's a joke, and I think everyone is well aware of that. There is no pure caster who's coming anywhere near any melee class in melee damage. I'd hazard a guess that your rogue is outdamaging some casters in average combat. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010363.html"><b>"Where have all the dragons gone?"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Guess what? The dragon just despawned! Right into thin air... Humm.]</i></font> <br><br>It think that it will take a bit of strategy, not to mention alacrity, to take on these encounters. Yes, they are rare spawns, and they depop if they haven't been killed in a certain amount of time. Don't worry, they won't depop while they are fighting. <br><br>If anything, I consider this format better for all than that of Vox and Nagafen. Vox and Nagafen are routinely killed as soon as the servers come up which makes it hard for some people to participate. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What for? Are my $10 a month not equal at 53+level?]</i></font> <br><br>There's four dragons outdoors and more than that indoors in Kunark.

How on earth do such things happen? What sort of baroque database design would allow character attributes (name, level, skills, etc.) to be retained, while "forgetting" all possessions?]</i></font> <br><br>One of the good (and bad) things about running a system with 300K users is that if we have a problem on our end, it's never just one person experiences it. I've never heard of this happening before. My first guess at what may have happened is that someone your friend gave his login info to took the stuff and destroyed anything NODROP. Every case of a wiped character that I am aware of could be tracked back to this with enough effort. <br><br>In any case, though I've never heard of it before, GMs still need to investigate every claim that they receive and act on them in short order. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What's worse, his first responses from /petitions have been, "it'll take up to four weeks to research this and possibly restore your items, and anything you gain between now and then will be lost."]</i></font> <br><br>I'm dismayed to hear that any GM would say anything of that nature since they all know that immediate investigations and responses are mandated by company policy. Please have your friend forward the GMs name to gscotto@verant.com along with a description of events. <br><br>I think that I've answered all of the questions you've posed in this thread. Please let me know if you need more info.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010018.html"><b>Roleplaying Server</b></a><br>We cannot enforce a roleplay server. Left unenforced, the environment on that server would be no different than any other server. <br><br>I think that it's the second sentence that you disagree with, but that is all there is to it. Roleplaying is a personal choice that everyone makes. If people wanting hardcore roleplay were to stick to their guns and do nothing but on any server out there, they might be able to turn peer pressure in their direction. However if they won't do it on a normal server, there's no reason to suggest that they'd do it on a server labled as a "roleplay" server. <br><br>Furthermore, any new server is going to attract a large and diverse number of people regardless of any label on the server. It would also definitely attract the people who would go there just to give the roleplayers a hard time. <br><br>I'm sorry that you don't agree, but the issue closed.

Please read the quote again: <br><br>"neither I nor other members of the tuning team actively seek out ways to make the lives of the players more difficult." <br><br>We don't sit around trying to come up with ways to make the LIVES of the players more difficult. We don't have discussions about the best way to go about upsetting the players. We address issues in game. If there's an imbalance, we'll fix it. We fix it because gameplay mechanics must be balanced in order for the game to be challenging. If it weren't challenging, no one would play. <br><br>Sure, this means that certain aspects of the game are made more difficult in nature. An encounter might become harder to overcome. A weapon that does far too much damage may be weakened. A pathing issue that allows people to slaugther without risk will be fixed. Though these things might make one particular aspect of gameplay more difficult in nature, that doesn't translate to making the LIVES of the player more difficult. <br><br>Changing an aspect of gameplay in a way that has no positive side makes the LIVES of the players difficult. The "necro nerfs" that you mention in the subject certainly had a positive side, and doesn't qualify.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010200.html"><b>Re-implement /Med Command</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Aye, and anyways, Abashi said that he would ask Rowyl to put the /med command back in when R gets back from vacation, and to expect to see it in next week's patch (two weeks from now).]</i></font> <br><br>Actually since "/book" will handle the function, I don't think that it's necessary to reimplement /med since it would do the same thing.</UL>

In one of the biggest Velious articles yet, DailyRadar has scored a big <a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_1402_1.html">interview with Brad McQuaid and Jeff Butler</a>.  Brad as we all know is Vice President of Verant and Jeff is the proucer of the second expansion.  It's a great read for those wanting more info on the expansion so check it out:<UL><b>DR: What sort of new monsters will EQers run into (and over and through)?</b><br><br>JB: Among the new NPC races are two breeds of Giants, the Kromrif and Kromzek, that chiefly occupy the eastern areas of Velious. The Kromrif are barbaric nomads who roam the tundra, and the mighty Kromrif have built a great citadel in the easternmost end of the largest of Veeshan's Scars. <br><br>In the mountains of the Great Divide live the Coldain, a race descended from dwarves who were shipwrecked on Velious long ago. They have been isolated for such a long period of time, they have no knowledge of the other lands and races of Norrath. <br><br> Deeper in Velious, a race of amphibious beings known as Sirens inhabit the scar filled by the Cobalt Ocean. <br><br>Players will also encounter new Dragons and their allies, including the spirits of Dragons long deceased. </UL>Thanks Solomon!

I received a new report from Jabkoraz:<BLOCKQUOTE>GM event on Druzzil Ro<br>August 30th 10PM PST<br> <br>    At about 10PM the Frontier Mountains zone was taken over several named Burynai that were slaughtering everyone in sight. When I came through I first got there, there was some role-playing going on between the Burynai and the players. They were claiming that our forces could never take them, much taunting went on. people were saying there were all at the giant fort so I headed there, along with around 20 other people, to clean them out. To our surprise they were very hard and were almost impossible to kill with such low forces. Cries for help went out to all the surrounding zones, guilds were gathered to help take the Burynai that had invaded this zone.<br><br>    When all of us had regrouped we heard that there was one wondering we headed out, to our surprise the lone Burynai Hugger was rather easy all the forces of the burynai included: Burynai Mystic, Burynai hugger, Burynai Helper, Burynai Chanter(I think), <br>Burynai  Stabber, Burynai Fighter, Burynai Burner, probably more I can't remember all the exact names. The Burynai Mystic and Fighter fell next. To everyone's surprise a barbarian named Burynai Slayer popped out and never attacked anyone. After the three fell the Burynai started to retreat no longer shouting taunts.<br><br>    After the fight everyone gathered around the Giant Fort where the Burynai Slayer said we all did quite well, said a few people (sorry guys I forgot names) were very valorous and handed them gifts, they didn't get anything though. After that he said he must go gather his forces to strike again sometime then he disappeared. None of the Burynai dropped anything except they were wielding weapons. I have no clue if they dropped the weapons or not.<br><br>    More of these were probably slain, I wasn't there for the start so I do not know how it got started.<br> <br>Jabkoraz Bloodfang</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

Items aren't supposed to all be completely useful from every standpoint. The Kunark armor that people have been finding typically has high AC and little in the way of stats, aside from a piece or two. You have to decide if the AC and the spell attached to each piece is worth giving up another piece of armor from a different place. <br><br>I would say that someone mixing and matching pieces of the high level armors is probably better off overall than the person who wears a complete set of one kind or another.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010264.html"><b>Tracking</b></a><br>We indeed have some ideas for tracking based upon the ideas presented here on the boards.

Now, not only that, there are now threads about how best to get Gordon to respond to a topic.]</i></font> <br><br>It's going to happen whatever we adopt.

Secondly, a larger portion of our increasing numbers are coming from overseas due to our arrangment with Ubisoft. These players aren't typically reflected in peak usage. <br><br>When we have concrete information on new/new-split servers, we'll be sure to let everyone know.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010205.html"><b>Pending God Changes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Anybody who did not buy Kunark would be losing<br>a feature they always had, the ability to go on<br>raids on the planes and face down the Gods.]</i></font> <br><br>Not really, there is nothing to say that they can't participate in one form or another. But even if we assume that what you are saying is basically true, they are losing the ability to kill an NPC named "XXX". That's basically it. <br><br>Here's the situation. The deities and dragons are meant to be top level encounters. We made an exception with Vox and Nagafen and kept them where they were even though the level cap went up. In order to do this, we had to place the level restriction on those encounters. <br><br>The same situation is present with the deities, and the solution that we have is a compromise. Vox and Nagafen remained the same yet higher level folks can't attack them, and the deities will increase in power, so the lower level folks won't be able to attack them. At the same time we are taking the loot from the current deities and moving it to NPCs that are equivalent in power to the current deities. <br><br>Leaving things as they are now is not a reasonable option.

In this case, any time you give your login information to someone else, you are essentially giving them permission to take your stuff. It's roughly the same as if you had handed the items off yourself. Though we don't have the logs going back six months to see when the items were taken, the information you've given is enough to see that we couldn't do a reimbursement for the sake of the integrity of the gaming environment. We can't allow the duplication of items to be as simple as giving out your account info out then contacting a GM for replacement. <br><br>Had we the logs for when your stuff disappeared, we could certainly track down the recipient of your belongings and take action against them. We could then give you back anything that we recovered from the offending party. In this case, we know that the items still exist, and can't just duplicate them given the information you've provided. <br><br>I'm sorry that we couldn't help you in this matter.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010141.html"><b>"Don't Ban Players for Duping!"</b></a><br>I think that it would take considerably less effort on our part and be considerably better for the game just to release someone like that rather than toying with them like a cat with a mouse. We'd rather the GMs spend time helping out customers we want to keep.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010135.html"><b>Patches</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I find the constant posting of patches in either PDT, EST, PST ? its all lost on me. I&#8217;m sure a lot of us out there would appreciate this.]</i></font> <br><br>We're GMT-8, meaning that it's 8 hours later in Greenwich. As far as posting it, we want to try and confuse the smallest number of people possible. For part of the world, we don't even get the date right as it is :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: its unfair to a HUGE amount of players who potentially after upwards of a years play will just be approaching the level required to encounter Gods]</i></font> <br><br>I understand your feelings on this. Frankly, could it be avoided we would. From an RP perspective, across many fantasy worlds created in novels and such, the power of a deity is based upon the number or strength of their followers. That's basically what's happening in Norrath, a combination of both. <br><br>From a loot perspective, we will indeed be moving thier current loot down to creatures powered similarly to what the deities are now. The deities will be populated with level 60 loot and become an appropriate encounter for a large group in that level range. Indeed, this will raise the bar for encountering a deity, however killing deities is supposed to be the pinnacle of success in EverQuest. So is encountering dragons, however in that case we decided to place the level cap on the old dragons to keep them within reach.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010136.html"><b>AC Upgrade</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Most of the people in the following thread encouragingly enough support an AC upgrade for us.]</i></font> <br><br>The issue is that monks stack up in AC versus the other classes right where they should right now, equipped in full shiverback. Going to some of the more mundane items that have been suggested actually gives them more ac than they should have. As I mentioned before, the problem is not that shiverback's ac is too low, but the other stuff mentioned has ac that is too high, from the monk's perspective due to their innate AC bonus. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010131.html"><b>Two Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Did you say that the pop up adds were going to be removed from the page? I hope so, you are going to get me in trouble at work]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, our ad people are all over it. No popup ads are supposed to be displayed in any game forum. They're the quickest way to chase away visitors, which we certainly don't want to do. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) This is probaby considered a closed issue, but what are the chances of getting Roror super buffed and put back on Beta Neutral. I am soon going to give up on cazic all together. I love that zone, but of course have to leave every now and then to sell, bank, quest, fight with guild mates, etc...]</i></font> <br><br>Actually something along these lines occurred about 2 or 3 patches ago.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010113.html"><b>Getting Gordon to Talk</b></a><br>Gossamer, I just looked for some of the posts you've made but only find this one since the boards were pruned.

I can't really give you any pointers on getting that done. Most days I pick a page between 1 and 10, answer a bunch of posts, then just refresh the thread index on that page. I usually come to the front two pages to check and see if anything new and interesting has popped up. <br><br>Lately, I've been spending more time addressing posts that end up down on page 10 without anyone noticing them.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010130.html"><b>Getting Gloves to Proc</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If the combat system does indeed go to an equipment slot to see if your gloves are magical whenever you punch could the programmers add a few lines of code there so that whenever the combat system checks for magic status it could also do a test to see if the gloves proc an effect?]</i></font> <br><br>These are very different situations, and I'm sorry but I can't explain it much more detail. In the case you mentioned, the hand, foot, shoulder slots are not accessed upon each hit. The ability of a character to hit, kick, slam magic creatures is set for the character upon equipping or removing the item, rather than by accessing the item upon each combat round. Sometimes the way something appears to work isn't the way it works from a mechanics standpoint. It's sort of like us being unable to make potions stackable. The fact that alcohol is stackable and activatable is completely separate from the idea of making potions that are stackable and activatable. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010068.html"><b>Unannounced Change in Mountain Giants?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Well i have been camping mountin giants for a few weeks now, solo with my jboots, im a 34 wizard and it seemed at first they had a very LOW resistance to Bonds of Force and Root, well since the last patch they are resisting those spells almost every other cast and i am getting trampled, I would just like to know if i was getting extremely unlucky or it was an unnanounced change, thank you]</i></font> <br><br>To be honest, I really don't know if the changes mentioned above occurred, but it's not really something that'd I'd go check on either. We don't announce standard tweaks to NPCs, as that is part of gameplay that is subject to change at any time. I will tell you that NPC resistances versus a particular line of spells cannot be set separately, so if they are more resistant it's probably because their magic resistance was increased.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010023.html"><b>Rogues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What!

Great damage output, hide/sneak, evade is very cool, our class armor is dropped ~ not quested, our quest weapon is decent ~ not sucky... it's posts like this that keep slamming rogues back down. If you keep saying we suck, people will keep believing it. The rogue class has had many upgrades, all positive, and we are now a very effective fighting machine.

They are not the ones who are running out of content. Furthermore, since they are low level, they progress rather quickly from one set of zones to another, meaning that enjoyment of any new specifically low-level zone would be fleeting. It's the mid and upper levels that are typically most in need of new content.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006971.html"><b>Iksar Armor</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon, I must admit that I have faith that Verant will (eventually) address this issue.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for bringing the issue back up, and I can let you know that there is forward progress being made on this issue. The biggest problem that we've identified and taken steps to correct is a gap between smithed armor, and Jarsath, that is at around 20 levels wide. <br><br>I reviewed the item list for 3 sets of class-specific armor three days ago, and the quests are now being written. <br><br>As for planar type equivalents, evalutation of that end of item availability is behind the mid-level stuff in priority. One we get these quests in we'll start looking at the other end of the spectrum.</UL>

Rogue pets aren't owned as such, and ownership can't be reapplied once it is lost.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009909.html"><b>Healing on PvP Servers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi put up a thread about a month ago that had several possibilities for code changes to fix the x-teamin and immortal healing on the Teams-PVP servers. Couldnt find the thread, so wondering if anyone knew if anything was decidied.]</i></font> <br><br>Indeed a decision was made, which I posted a week or so ago. Basically its apparent from the responses to that thread that there are many different schools of thought out there on the issue. Given that, we determined that with this case, the number of people that we'd upset with any of the suggested changes would lead to less satisfaction overall than exists currently. We've decided not to implement any changes in regard to this matter. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Verant throws alot of hollow bones at people to keep them from leaving.

Enchanters strength has always been in making their enviroment work for them, that includes their teammates.]</i></font> <br><br>I didn't say that it would be damaging to the game, illusioning others just isn't something that enchanters do. It's not one of the abilities of their class. When setting up these class abilities we have to form a framework of the types of things that they should and should not be able to do. Applying illusions to others is in the should-not column. It's a basic foundation for the class, and is not something that we will change. <br><br>Along the same lines as wizards not casting DOT spells, enchanters cannot apply illusions to others. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The /target command helps some but the radius of this command IS TOO SMALL]</i></font> <br><br>That's possible.

As Gestalt said, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Even given the flaws of certain components of a class (and all classes have such flaws), does it indicate a problem with the entire class? In the case of the enchanter, I'd have to say no. The enchanter is designed to be primarily a group-class, and remain one of the classes most desired by groups due to what they can do for the group. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But from what I'm hearing from TEST, shamans and enchanters are both given a pretty equal role in enchanting stuff ????]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry, but I don't want to comment on this until it enters production.</UL>

Gordon got an early start on the Gameplay Board today with the following posts he generated:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009890.html"><b>Shadow Knights Dead?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When asked what spells are useful to a group a SK can cast the response has Been NONE or one<br>Darkness??? maybe<br><br>On a poll at: <br><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/</a><br>SK&#8217;s are DEAD last!!!!]</i></font> <br><br>EverQuest has 14 classes. *Someone* had to be last. Being last here is not really indicative of any problem. Besides, the difference between SKs and some of the other bottom classes is really not that great. For instance, someone could say "SKs are preferred over monks in groups 47% of the time", and suddenly it wouldn't sound as bad. <br><br>But that poll did not ask who you want in your group, it asked what is the *FIRST* class you look for when forming a group. There's a tremendous difference between those two questions. Of course regardless of what question you ask that has people rank a list, there will still always be someone in the list who is last. <br><br>I think that SKs need to start doing what I sugggested rogues do a few months ago: Show people what you can do, educate them in the ways of an sk, but most importantly, be cool with people. Your personality and reputation has far more to do with what groups you get into than your class. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009933.html"><b>Mez Stacking</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Mez stacking is broken. Every other spell line works this way. Better spells overwrite the weaker ones.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry that you don't agree, but as I said before, mez spell stacking works as intended. NPCs only know if they are mez'd or not, and the spell effect is absolute regardless of the duration of the spell. I've spread the word around that this is indeed not a bug, so you shouldn't get conflicting information going forward.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009938.html"><b>Velicous Creatures</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: PLEASE tell me its not a rehash of exsisting MOBS / Monsters with pretty new colors.]</i></font> <br><br>There will of course be some new variaties of existing creatures, as there is in Kunark, but there will also be a bunch of new ones as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: P.S. Will this new graphics engine revamp ALL of Everquest or just the new areas in SoV]</i></font> <br><br>As with Kunark, the new areas will adopt newer and more advanced technology. "EverQuest Proper", however, has to remain as it was in the original release.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009940.html"><b>Dragons</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are we told that the three dragons for the high level are now rare spawns? Why are we facing more hardship the higher the lvls we get? I really think that this change is rediculous and should have been annouced before you waisted alot of people time.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm afraid that I don't understand your complaint. NPC spawn rates/times etc., are never broadcast to the players. Secondly, I'm not sure what you mean by "waisted a lot of people's time". If you mean that people were waiting in the zone when the servers came up to get the dragons, and they weren't there, that doesn't really equate to much lost time at all. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009953.html"><b>Mana Battery</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon, about this quote:<br><br>"I'm sorry, but we've ruled out creating "mana batteries". The greatest extent that we can implement a mana battery is done with..." <br><br>Why, then, do you continue to leave bards broken, serving nothing more than this purpose? Its what we've been complaining about for ages.]</i></font> <br><br>I don't understand what you are getting at here, if you could elaborate. The subject of allowing enchanters to create mana batteries, and the existing modulation rod and the necromancer "conversion" line are not, in my opinion, related to bards. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009963.html"><b>What would you do if you caught someone cheating?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The GM could not verify that this item was in the players posession and gave that player the benefit of doubt and reimbursed the item. I was immediately told this occurance by the player. They bragged how they got over on the gm.]</i></font> <br><br>We'd certainly appreciate you /reporting such things if witnessed. Our new customer service policies regarding reimbursement is based on our ability to determine things from the logs, but you are correct that we will give the benefit of the doubt lacking any concrete evidence to the contrary. <br><br>However, if this is abused everyone is aware of the impact upon the game it will have, which is why we ban any scammers immediately.</UL>

Yakatizma hit the new <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Coalition+of+Tradesfolk&number=8">Coalition of Tradesfolk Board</a> recently and has made several posts to date:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000076.html"><b>Recipes</b></a><br>The recipes themselves are indeed the simplest part of the process. It is the many factors that play into balance and any extra coding that needs to be done that is the most time consuming. Once the properties, economic values, availability and difficulty of the product and its components plus the impact of the final product on existing items are determined the recipe table can be produced and placed for testing. This is why some content with very low balancing issues can be implemented quickly and others, blacksmithing for example, with high balance issues are very time consuming. For instance, the silk thread, bandages, small bag, and silk cord, all of which had extremely minimal balance issues were placed on test server the same day I saw them on the wishlist, but of course for them to appear on the live servers they must go through testing and wait for an available patch.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000066.html"><b>Chemistry</b></a><br>There is one other class that dabbles in a chemistry of sorts that can mix dyes besides Shaman.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000047.html"><b>Trade Skill Messages</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Implement a new message for tradeskills with the same display range as /say.<br>For example, if successful: "A sparkle of light gleams from Laestir's jewelry kit."<br>Alternately, if unsuccessful: "Laestir empties his jewelry kit of ruined materials."]</i></font><br><br>This is a very desirable feature in my opinion. I will attempt to have it addressed at the next tuning meeting.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000036.html"><b>Fletching</b></a><br>I'll come up with an arrow recipe that uses ****atrice beaks but the benefit of the arrow will have to be in its damage/delay ratio and its magic/non magic flag. Unfortunately the current engine does not allow for missiles to have procs. Another problem would be the fact that items with spell effects can not be made stackable, making storage and reloading of missiles with effects difficult.<br>--<br>If there are other items that you feel would make sense as fletching components in addition to the c-ockatrice beak I would like to see a list of them posted.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000014.html"><b>Tailoring</b></a><br>Thank you for the feedback. I have changed the icon for silk threads to the "urticating hairs" graphic, changed the weight of Silk Bandages to 0.2 and removed the skill check from creating Silk Thread.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000105.html"><b>Enchanters</b></a><br>Fear not enchanters. The summon mana series of spells has been expanded for use in enchanted trade skill items and you may find that enchanted precious metals have uses outside of jewelry craft. It is true that some items with special properties may need a cleric or shaman in addition to an enchanter, and in the case of some cultural items from societies without casters may exclude the enchanter entirely. However, the magic items produced with the assistance of a Cleric or Shaman are very noticeably different than those produced with solely enchanters. Enchanters will remain true to their namesake as masters of enchantments.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000013.html"><b>Tinkering</b></a><br>For tinkering to produce the mechanical wonders and blunders that gnomes are famous for it must be fairly heavily reliant on products of other trade skills as well as odds and ends found by the gnome as he adventures. The plus side of the dependency on other trade skills and treasure drops is that the difficulty to create a tinkered item will allow for more beneficial and/or powerful end products. Once the blacksmithing goes live I will be continuing to add content to the trade skills, including tinkering as I work on Velious. If any of you tinkers have good ideas that you would like to see implemented for the trade skill please post them on this board, ideally with the prefix Wish :(  title of post)there were some good suggestions for several trade skills on the wishlist board and now that this board is back up hopefully there will be many more.</UL>On a sidenote, you may have noticed I have started putting two spaces inbetween posts on the infobits.  If you like it double-spaced or single-spaced please leave a comment indicating it.
