<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
More posts were made today on the Gameplay Board by Gordon Wrinn.  Here's the skinny:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049536.html"><b>Wizard Runes</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: We have two runes of Fulguration, both marked the same but for different spells.  We have two runes of Attraction - same issue.]</i><br> <br>We should probably mark these runes Azia and Beza and update the research text accordingly. I'll see what I can do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049524.html"><b>Solusek Ro Server</b></a><br>Several servers can make very logical cases for a split. The ones that we do will be based upon the need that presents itself. I have noticed a fairly large off-peak population on Solusek Ro, indicating many international players on that server, but that of course isn't peak usage, and isn't part of the problem. <br><br>Next week after we take care of the TZ/VZ ruleset issue, we'll look into further population balancing methods across the servers, starting first with the servers with the highest at-peak population. We'll talk more about our plans then.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049535.html"><b>Camping</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: If i want to sit at one spawn site and camp a npc anywhere in the freakin world,i should be allowed to do so.]</i> <br><br>But when it's the same people who are choosing to do that that go around to the boards and various gamesites declaring how EQ is boring, we have to ask why they choose to do that. <br><br>In general, we've found that a non-trivial population will take the quickest path possible to leveling, regardless of the tedium that that particular path might present. The way to avoid tedium is to see that risk and reward are in balance. If we give these solitary and stationary fast-spawns spawn-times equivalent to the level of the NPC, then doing the boring camp for hours on end isn't as quick as getting into an underutilized dungeon with a good group. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049538.html"><b>More on Karana Server Switches</b></a><br>We'll probably split it to one server, not several. It is problematic as you mention to do something along the lines of splitting 500 accounts to one server, and 500 to another. That said, if we do pick up 1000 people and move them to Saryrn or 7th (most likely possibilities), history has shown that only about 40% represent peak usage. We'll also still be unable to guarantee that guilds stay together.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049573.html"><b>More on Server Switches</b></a><br>No, your current characters on Tallon will not be lost. Your Vallon characters will just be added to the account. Please keep in mind that if any of the characters have the same name, you'll end up with an X after the duplicate name.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049497.html"><b>Swapping Characters Between Servers</b></a><br>It won't be possible to swap characters between the servers. If you register /movelog on both servers, all of your characters will end up on whichever one is done last. If they total more than 8, the ones over 8 (by alpha) won't be accessible until you delete other characters.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049462.html"><b>Strength</b></a><br>Strength not only raises max damage, but average damage as well. 20 per hit in this case translates to a good deal more damage per minute than with lower stregth. <br><br>Stats, all of the stats, and set up so they provide a reasonable advantage without becoming the "only" advantage.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049504.html"><b>EQG3 Question</b></a><br>Just interested in hearing who from the boards here will be attending the gathering in Vegas in July. I heard yesterday that well over 300 people are signed up, which should lead to over 600 people attending if the walk-in percentage is anywhere near what the St. Louis Gathering's numbers were. <br><br>I'm looking forward to putting some faces to the names here.<br>--<br>The website for the gathering is at <a href="http://eqgathering.bizland.com.">http://eqgathering.bizland.com.</a> Officially it's on Sunday July 9th, but there are other events going on that whole weekend. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049506.html"><b>Shaman and Charm Animal</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Shamen are not at one with nature, they already have a pet. What on earth was the rationale behind giving them Charm Animal?]</i> <br><br>Basically, shaman had charm for a while after release. We then removed it from them and gave them Befriend animal instead, based on the idea that they are a nature type moreso than not. When going through checking caps on certain spells in preparation for the launch of Kunark, we discoverd that Befriend Animal wasn't capped like other charm spells. So we capped it, leaving shaman unable to charm a lot of things that they could. <br><br>Charm animal, the upgrade to Befriend, was given to them to give them a portion of that power back.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049369-2.html"><b>Skill Check on Tailoring: Robe of the Lost Circle</b></a><br>I agree that the skill check is a pain. Let me see what I can do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049424.html"><b>The View of a Warrior</b></a><br>BosDragon made some excellent points in this post. I recommend it as a good read.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049406.html"><b>Add New Corpse Recovery Commands</b></a><br>This issue comes up from time to time and as we've said, it is not a change that we are planning on pursuing at this time. When /corpse was introduced, it was put in to give people a way to get their corpse out of a wall or tree without requiring them to wait for customer-service assistance. The concept of "dragging" corpses around for people was not the original intent, however it did present another way for someone to interact with their fellow players, so we continued to allow the ability. <br><br>Conning people into giving consent and then stealing their belongings is a very quick way to get an account canceled. We can't however guarantee that the victim will get their equipment back in these cases. This is a risk, and is the only risk involved. Like so many other things in the game, if the risk of getting your stuff stolen is too great, don't /consent someone. Players are fully responsbile for who they choose to /consent. Yes, we will pursue and ban people taking advantage of people in this manner, but players need to bear some responsibility for the choices they make. <br><br>Do not consent someone who you do not trust.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049179.html"><b>More on Bannings</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: What is the official procedure for suspensions and bannings including what avenues of appeal do you have when you feel that you have been unfairly punished . Thankyou in advance for your time]</i> <br><br>It depends on the specific situation. <br><br>Depending upon what the person involved has done, there may or may not be a warning, or warnings issued prior to taking more severe action. <br><br>Suspensions are documented and approved by a Lead. Bans are documented and approved by the head GM. In either case, word of the action is sent to the email address of record, the one they set within the EQ account data interface. The appeal route is different for each instance and is explained in the email that informs them of the action. <br><br>I hope this answers everyone's questions. If you need more info, please let me know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049253.html"><b>Root Spell Series Not Fixed?</b></a><br>I checked entrapping, engorging, ensnaring, engulfing, and grasping last night. I didn't find any problem. <br><br>The defined problem that was fixed was the spell was breaking at the time that it hit. This is evident when the spell break message is printed before the "feet become entwined" or similar message. This did not occur in any of my tests. <br><br>The roots can still break quickly, and the occurance of that is not a bug as long as the break message occurs after the effect message.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049272.html"><b>A Court-System for Bannings</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why not have in game trials for those that are being banned.  GM's could send serverwide announcements with the name of the player pleading his case and randomly select people that are online asking them if they wish to be a juror.]</i> <br><br>I really don't think that people would go for the idea of other players (who are paying customers just like the accused) deciding their destiny. People often think that there is favoritism in the current system, I can only imagine that that feeling would be *supported* by doing something of this nature. Imagine it on a PvP server. <br><br>The entire disciplinary process needs to be held to the highest standard of integrity. That cannot be done by turning it into a public spectacle where popularity would often determine outcome. <br><br>I'd ask everyone to consider for a moment that we have *nothing* to gain, and everything to lose by banning someone unjustly. If we ban someone unjustly, we not only lose a good paying customer, but we lose everyone that could buy the game and play it based upon their recommendation. We also stand a good chance to lose current customers over the situation as well. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/046817.html"><b>Seven Player Groups Popping Up</b></a><br>It's a bug, and use of it is considered an exploit. We're looking into ways to fix it now. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048583.html"><b>Relaxed Stance for Female Models?</b></a><br>I'm checking to see if there's a bug or if the animations do not exist. And yes, we've heard of the female bard animation issue as well :)</UL>

Garthe has the following event announcement to share:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hear Ye, Hear Ye, the Freeport Tavern (Drunks) guild on the Morell-Thule <br>server will be hosting an event this Saturday June 10 at 9 PM EST.  It will <br>be held in West Freeport.  Registration for these events will start about an <br>hour before, so be sure to get inline about an hour before hand to register <br>unless you pre-register by email.<br><br>The events will happen as described below.<br><br>Our first event for the evening will be a newbies vs. Garthe match.  Any <br>people level 5 and under will register prior to the event with a Freeport <br>Tavern member near the Arena in West Freeport and must not be /anon.  Then <br>all the participants will enter the arena, and when told GO will attempt to <br>kill Garthe, he will be fighting back, so prepare for a death.  However, the <br>person who strikes the killing blow will win a Greater Lightstone!  We will <br>have 2 rounds of this event.  There is NO entrance fee for this event, <br>however Harm Touch users will be disqualified if it is used, and there will <br>be a cleric on hand to reverse HT effects. Spell casters are also allowed to <br>participate; however DoTs will be frowned upon.<br><br>The Second event will consist of Last Man Standing in the Arena.  We will <br>break people into level ranges and users must register with an appointed <br>guild member before participating.  All participants will enter the arena <br>and when told GO will try to kill everybody else in the arena.  The LAST <br>person standing will win a Greater Lightstone.  Second place winners will <br>win a Regular Lightstone.  This event will continue as long as we have <br>enough people for each level range.  This is also a free entrance.  Level <br>ranges are as follows:<br><br>1 to 4<br>5 to 7<br>8 to 11<br>12 to 15<br>16 to 19<br>20 to 23<br>24 to 27<br>Etc.<br><br><br>The Third event for the evening will be a Drunk Chase, also in West Freeport <br>and will start at the Gate.  Upon registration into this event, alcohol will <br>be given to the participant.  Just before starting each participant will <br>drink his or her alcohol when told. We will already have a runner somewhere <br>in West FP who will ALSO be drunk, and when told GO all people will run all <br>around West FP trying to find our guild runner, the first person to INSPECT <br>successfully will win a Greater Lightstone and the pot money.  There will be <br>a small entrance fee for this event that will be paid to the guild member <br>you register with.  The fees will follow this formula and FTD will not be <br>keeping any cuts:<br><br>Levels 1 to 5, 5gp<br>For each range after add an additional 5gold. (6-10 1pp, 11-15 1.5pp etc)<br><br>Registration for each of these events will be handled by a single person for <br>an event, a line will form in front of this person to easily register names. <br>  This will start at 8pm EST near the arena.  You may also PRE Register by <br>email gartheb@hotmail.com with your character name, level, and the event or <br>events you wish to participate in.  ONLY People registered will be eligible <br>for prizes.<br><br>If our supply of GLSs or LSs runs out, we may substitute a cash prize <br>instead.  Hopefully this won't happen though.<br><br>Alcohol will be given out to people as long as our supply lasts, but please <br>don't get greedy, we will have 1 or 2 people giving it out so it won't be <br>hard to remember names of people who ask for alcohol repeatedly.<br><br>This is the Freeport Tavern Drunks first event and we're hoping to have a <br>lot of fun!  Come out and enjoy yourself.  You can check out our website at <br><a href="http://ftdrunks.freeservers.com">http://ftdrunks.freeservers.com</a> for member info etc or for updated info on <br>this event.

I received the following letter from Zamzi:<BLOCKQUOTE>The Zek Lottery<br><br>As part of the upcoming changes on Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek<br>Here's what I propose I am willing to donate 100 pp and a Stein of Moggok to <br>kick start a lottery on what the Final Numbers will be at 10 PM EDT on the <br>first Saturday following the switch. The player who selects the number <br>closest to the number of players on Each server, without going over, will win <br>70% of the prize. The next closest will win 20 % of the donations and the <br>third closest will win 10 %. All items donated will be awarded to the first <br>place finisher. <br><br>De rulez. <br><br>Numbers are secured by response to this post. No entry fee. You must list <br>your character's name and your prediction in Tallon Zek / Vallon Zek Order. <br><br>Your predictions should be in 100 unit increments i.e. 100/3000 meaning 100 <br>players on Tallon 3000 players on Vallon. <br><br>Predictions will close at Noon (12PM EDT) the day before the switch. <br><br>One post per character per Eqvault screen name, we will filter screen the <br>name combos. So please don't abuse the fun with multiple postings. Also all <br>anonymous names will be deleted. <br><br>Award will be made at the first available opportunity that the winners and <br>Zamzi can find a quiet corner of the world and trade. For obvious reasons <br>there will be no "Awards Ceremony". <br><br>All rules are subject to change without notice. I have never run a lottery <br>before and if I have seriously overlooked something critical I will correct <br>it. <br><br>Additional prizes, I would like to develop this to be a little more worthy <br>prize wise but as a 22nd level guild less Shaman I don't have more to offer. <br>If you like this idea and can afford to bolster the prize total please post <br>your donation here and I will give an in game tell to arrange pick up. I <br>would love a friendly Wizzie to help with this step. All money and items <br>collected will be given out as prizes. I am not keeping any thing, only doing <br>this cuz it sounds like fun. (And even if it is a screaming success I will <br>not be called on to do something like it again, the event is just too unique) <br>Open posting keeps it all honest and on the up and up if a little cumbersome. <br><br>The primary goal of the lottery is to have some fun. The secondary goal is to <br>smoke out who knows their smack versus the tongue wagers who don't know <br>squat. The final goal is to encourage a healthy player base on Vallon Zek so <br>all prizes will be awarded there. So put your thinking cap on, and post your <br>prediction and we will see you back on the First Saturday Night following the <br>switch, 10PM EDT if you cannot play at that time we will post the results on <br>this thread. <br><br>Zamzi De Troll<br>Vallon Zek (and staying)</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

The following Patch Addendum is now being displayed on the Patch Server:<UL>June 6th, 7:00pm<br>-----------------<br><br>*Patch Addendum*<br><br>A few changes were not included in the patch message earlier today:<br><br>- Banshee Aura has had its duration increased.<br>- Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale will no longer be canceled by being the target of a melee attack. Ranged attacks and spells will still cancel the spell.<br>- Shaman can now cast Charm Animal<br>- Some enchanter and shaman spells have had their casting times/mana costs altered.<br>- Augment, Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture, and Clarity II have had their mana cost lowered.<br>- Root spells that cause damage (Druid roots, Hungry Earth) now work properly.<br><br>Additionally, NPCs now have a maximum amount that they can be slowed prior to being damaged.  This change should only affect users of the 54th level Bard song, which, when coupled with the bard "fear" song allowed them to stop fleeing NPCs completely, while rendering them unable to make any attacks.  <br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

One player charges that Verant is trying to do away with solo'ing in EQ altogether.  Gordon took the time to respond to this post.  Here's the scoop:<UL>Read the patch message. They noticed that those in a good class can gain exp much faster by not grouping and blasting static spawns, than take their chancesi n a group somewhere dangerous and get killed. So, instead of fixing the game to do what people obviously want to do, they're changing it so we have to play "their way" (see: the Vision(tm)). We made a stink about nerfing our classes, so they decided instead, to nerf the things we kill. Nice move. Hell with it, AC may suck hard, but I can solo as long as I want.<br><br><b><i>No Breuter, there's no intention here to "end" soloing, but what we have always said is that soloing should be a more difficult and longer path to advancement, even for those classes designed to be soloable. <br>These high level 6 minute static and solitary spawns make extended camping (which everyone agrees is boring) a preferred method for advancement.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Spotted on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049126.html">this thread</a> on the Gameplay Board.

The issue of speaking publicly about player bannings was raised again recently on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the first post followed by Gordon's:<UL>Perception.<br><br>It's all about perception.<br><br>In just the last few minutes, I've seen a couple of nasty stories about "unfair" bannings.<br><br>One about somebody who was given an item from a gm that he wasn't supposed to have. Maybe he should have questioned more about where the item come from, but did he know the other person was a gm? I honestly can't say I would have done anything different, looking a gift horse in the mouth and all, ESPECIALLY at a time when lots of people knew that drops in Kunark were much much better than they were supposed to be. (Ok, we didn't know they weren't supposed to be that way, but we did know they were much better than most things on the original continents)<br><br>A second story is about somebody who claims to use a spawn timing method that I actually thought was quite ingenious, using only the tools that are given to you in the game. (/time and the command history, available using shift-up) Maybe the person was using a packet pusher, maybe they weren't.<br><br>A third story is about somebody who ran around dragging a corpse behind them, probably using a hotkey for /corpse. (You did know you can do this, can't you?) Why provide the hotkeys if we're not meant to use them?<br><br>Yes, all of these stories could be incorrect, and surely they're only one side of the story, but you know what? If the people reading this board only can see one side of the story, and that side sounds reasonable (which in all three of these cases, they do), guess what people are going to believe?<br><br>If you have reasons to believe that the person with the timing method was using a third party program, then post them. If you have reasons to believe the person dragging their corpse was using a third party program, then post them.<br><br>Cause from the player's perspective, right now you're starting to look more and more like ogres. (no offense meant to those of the larger, uglier races)<br><br><b><i>I understand your opinion, but individual account issues will not be discussed in the court of public opinion. If the owner of the account wants to contact the Head GM and then post the communications, that is their choice to make those communications public. <br><br>People can say anything that they like here in public about why they were banned. Sure, we could get in here and argue each issue, but doing that would be fruitless. There is no information that could be placed on this board that someone couldn't claim was "manufactured", leaving the other side with no further avenue to argue the issue, and having the whole thing devolve into a case of "Yes you did/No I didn't". <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Some unannounced changes were made to the Bard class.  Here's the original post and Gordon's response from the Gameplay Board:<UL>Yes once again bards get a stealth nerf. This time they have nerfed both out lvl 23 song (Selo's Consonant Chain) and our lvl 54 song (Selo's Assonait Strane). Chains used to stop feared mobs at 50% health. Very useful for tight fights when the healer is OOM. Strane used to stop full health mobs when feared when played with a magic lute. Now they do not.<br><br>Chains is the worse nerf of the two. It is a mainstay of every bards song list after 23rd level. To have the movement portion of this song changed, WITH NO WARNING, is typical.<br><br>I am too pissed to write anymore at the moment. This is just sad.<br><br><b><i>Ack, yes, I meant to announce this.<br><br>Basically, NPCs now have a maximum amount that they can be slowed down without being damaged. <br><br>There was a particular exploit where two bards could get together, play this song (the level 54 one), and the Fear song, and any NPCs in the effect range would stop dead in their tracks and not fight back when being killed. <br><br>I'll announce it in the addendum that I'll post shortly.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Here's the latest from Gordon Wrinn from off the pages of the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049084.html"><b>Karana Server</b></a><br>We're looking into options for Karana now. Whether that will entail bringing up a new split server, or splitting people off to one of the 4 existing underutilized servers we won't know until about the middle of next week. <br><br>We also have a situation with Bertox again due to the sort-order defaulting to alpha order for the past few weeks.

Think you could dedicate some of that free time and not make mobs play by rules that we cant play by]</i><br> <br>Well mobs can't exactly go track down a rogue to open the door for them. And they aren't as intelligent as the average player. They therefore get some special advantages to remain competitive. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049080.html"><b>The Clipping Plane</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Congratulations Verant!

A combine dagger in North Karana costs around 36pp, with a fine steel costing 48pp.... any comments on that?]</i> <br><br>Fine steel weapons sell at a large premium on vendors because we prefer that players trade amongst themselves for the weapons. It's basically to spur the economy on. We really wouldn't expect that anyone would actually pay for a fine steel weapon from a vendor considering the price. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Second, is there any place to submit ideas for new quests?

Classes are balanced primarily for Player versus Environment (PvE). <br><br>We've had to make a few changes to the way things work in PvP in order to deal some balance issues that pop up. For example, in PvP, spells do 2/3rds damage versus another player. This is because the spells are designed to be effective versus NPCs, and are much too strong versus players who often have far less hitpoints than an equalently leveled NPC. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049023.html"><b>Patch Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Ok, I have three small issues with the new patch. First, didn't you say the Druid root series would be fixed? We've been waiting FOREVER.]</i> <br><br>Yes, it's in today. I'll post it in the patch message addendum. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Secondly you said, "Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different than they actually are. This includes all racial illusions, as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series." How many times have you told us that wolfform/treeform ARE NOT illusions?]</i> <br><br>From an RP standpoint, they are not illusions. From a programming standpoint, they are handled the same way. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: And lastly, you said, "there are many cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk." How do you figure? Any time you attack a creature there is risk, not to mention a single spawn will not give you the XP/loot that a good dungeon group will.]</i> <br><br>And example of a "fast spawn" is something that spawns much faster than a critter in a dungeon at a similar level would. For example, a level 40 critter spawning every 6 minutes would be a "fast spawn". Now if this spawn is stationary and solitary, the risk is reduced tremendously. That's what I was trying to point out. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Quit trying to NERF everything]</i> <br><br>We've still made far more enhancements to the game that people would consider generally positive in nature than we have made ones that they'd consider negative. Regardless of how people view the change, we feel that they are in the best interest of the game overall. <br><br>For example, in regards to those fast spawns, people will often sit there and camp them for hour after hour, doing an admitedly boring and repetitive task because they view it to be "faster". In the mean time, they are bored to death. Our goal in these cases is to make doing more exciting things, such as fighting in a dungeon, "faster". This way people are having fun while leveling up instead of being bored from camping one creature for hours. That's the goal anyway.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048984.html"><b>Warruirs & Stun</b></a><br>Yes, kicks with an integral chance to stun are indeed an ability gained by warriors post-50. I have not though commented on what level the ability is gained.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048977.html"><b>Why wasn't the weight on the Tranquil Staff reduced?</b></a><br>Some of the weapon weights are intentional. I will check to insure that they got all of the ones that were mistaken, but the tranquil staff is one of those that is meant to be very heavy (monk-wise anyway). It's an incredibly powerful weapon and needed a pretty substantial drawback.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048974.html"><b>Security Breach on Rallos Zek?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I am reposting this issue from the ralloszek.net OOC forum. It involves a former abusive player on Rallos Zek who has close personal ties with Brad McQuaid and has since become a Lead-GM on Rallos Zek. This issue transcends the coin loot issue and leads credence to a true conspiracy.]</i><br> <br>First, lets get off this idea that any time something happens that is questionable that the people involved must have "close personal ties with Brad McQuaid". No one working here has close enough personal ties with anyone that they would put the integrity of the game at risk. <br><br>That said, this is a coincidence. With several million characters in existence, it was only a matter of time before a GM begining work here chose a name that had some history on a particular server. When things of this nature happens, we investigate the issue to insure that integrity is maintained. We're having the GM choose a new name since this one evidently caused quite a stir on Rallos. <br><br>Furthermore I should mention that that particular GM isn't the GM for Rallos. He was just in the process of creating his GM name across all of the servers when he was spied in the /who list. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: On my origional post on this topic, a Verant emploee with the screen name Verant_Thom agreed to look into this.  Does anyone know who this is in the Verant Hierarchy?]</i><br><br>He's the Customer Service Manager for EverQuest. Jeff Butler was promoted to the position of Producer of EQLive back in March.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048965.html"><b>Posion Components</b></a><br>It's too soon for me to say how many of the existing components will continue to be usable with the new recipies. One of the guys was creating a bunch of new components yesterday and is putting the new recipies together. Assuming that we follow the same logic as before with the Alchemy revamp, existing poisons should continue to be makeable, but new ones will probably require new components. I really need to sit down with the designer before I'll be able to comment intelligently though, which I probably won't do until the new system has been approved.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048807-2.html"><b>Lock Door Explotation?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: What is the position of GMs on it? Is it allowed? Or is it a bannable offense?]</i> <br><br>It's not considered illegal at present, but more of a design consequence. In any case, I don't think that it is as reliable as having a rogue there to open the door for you. <br><br>We've been considering a few different options to eliminate this issue. One would be for all NPCs to walk through doors without opening them, like it was in beta. This looks bad though. We've got a couple other ideas that we are thinking about as well. <br><br>Does anyone feel that this is an issue that needs attention? In other words, do you feel that these are reliable enough options as to decrease the importance of rogues?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048893.html"><b>Fix the Howling Harpoon!</b></a><br>We are aware of this problem. We're still trying to decide what spell-effect to put on it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048937.html"><b>GMs Playing on the Same Server?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: It has come to my attention that we have a new Lead-Admin GM on Rallos Zek named Temporalis. I find it rather curious this GM is the same name, race, class, and gender of a player from the early days on Rallos. <br>More to the point, I find it troublesome that this person was a guild leader of Bane of the Living....one of the earliest PK guilds (not PvP...PK). This person left the server after being hunted again and again by any number of guilds out there. <br>Would you, Verant, please reassure us on Rallos Zek that you have not placed someone in an administrative position for our server that might hold grudges against players there?]</i><br><br>This is a coincidence. With several million characters in existence, it was only a matter of time before a GM begining work here chose a name that had some history on a particular server. When things of this nature happens, we investigate the issue to insure that integrity is maintained.

He was just in the process of creating his GM name across all of the servers when he was spied in the /who list. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: With respects, one question. As you are not a usual poster to the boards Verant_Thom, could I ask who you are?....Position wise if not by name. It is reassuring to have an idea who we are speaking with.]</i> <br><br>Thom is the Customer Service Manager for EverQuest. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048480.html"><b>Bumping It</b></a><br>There are a lot of posts on the board here that people "bump" quite often in hopes of getting some sort of response. Though persistence is commendable, sometimes the content of the post where the response is being demanded isn't really something that I like to respond to. <br><br>Posts from people who want an armor item with a specific look are not infrequent here on the boards. We treat it as a wishlist item and keep it in mind when creating new items. It's not the sort of thing that I want to give the impression that we are "promising" the item, nor do I want to rule it out as a possibility. <br><br>The best suggestion I can offer for things such as this are to make your opinion and desires known, but please don't demand a response, and pleasee don't feel like you are being ignored if you don't get one. </UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Today's Patch Message is now live.  Here's a complete copy of it:<UL>June 6th, 8:00am<br>-----------------<br><br><b>*Patch Day*</b><br><br>Greetings! The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest data on the Test Server:<br><br><b>*General*</b><br><br>- Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes.  Check your Kunark spell vendors.<br>- Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths upon zoning.  The majority of these issues should no longer occur.<br>- Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.<br>- Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle, Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.<br>- Upon review we've increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in Kunark.  They should be more plentiful now. <br>- Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets and other NPCs to get around the zones.<br><br><b>*Items*</b><br><br>- A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword.  Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their sword out for a working one.<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your possession when you leave the game.<br>- A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight.<br>- Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark.<br><br><b>*PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions*</b><br><br>Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently mesmerize or stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, illusions will now automatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion casts an offensive spell upon any player-character.  Players should keep this in mind before attacking with spells in an area where their faction standing is less than desirable.  <br><br>Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different than they actually are.  This includes all racial illusions, as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series.  <br><br><b>*Risk and Reward*</b><br><br>The concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of EverQuest.  Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should also provide substantial risk.  Over the past several weeks, we've been identifying areas in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and making necessary adjustments. <br><br>In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward for a specific action.  For example, we recently increased the experience awarded in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk associated with adventuring there.  We also do this quite frequently by increasing the reward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as we did last week with the Burning Rapier quest.  <br><br>However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess of the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those above as we come across them.  For example, there are many cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk.  <br><br>Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we did want to let you know that you will see risk/reward disparities corrected over the next several weeks.<br><br><b>*PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers*</b><br><br>As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP combat.  Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item from the fallen, whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.<br><br>Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek post-production, we've decided to allow characters on both servers a one-time character-move.  Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT on Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm PDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000.  You can register for the move by executing the "/movelog yes" command during the registration window.  There is no limit to the number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and Vallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<br><br>Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can not be rescinded.  The actual character-move will take place sometime next week, at a time to be announced later.  Please keep in mind that corpses are not moved in a character-move, so we'd recommend against leaving unclaimed corpses around after Monday of next week if you've asked to be moved. <br><br>Questions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay Message Forum available via www.everquest.com.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Kolath!

Banegrivm brings us the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>It all started one fatefull day when followers of both light and dark gods amassed for a battle of epic proportions that would never be forgotten. It was a time when Norrath needed heroes, where villains rued the day, the gates of hate opened wide, and a legacy was born. An army of light stood to defend the gates of High Keep from an assault led by Innoruuks daughter. The army of light stood victorious as Lanys had been cast into hate, and the heads of Teir Dal lined the <br>gates of high keep.<br><br>Sometime later the standard that had valiantly defended high keep sailed once more; enter the 1st Fist of Light. Within the confines of Neriak there had been a <br>stir, orders issued, and a crest of hate and retribution vile was raised; enter the Fist of Hate.<br><br>Now the war of hate that had once been is reborn. Sides have been drawn and the story unfolds once more. Brave heroes and villains fight on a battlefield to <br>determine the fate of Norrath. <br><br>Rumors scourge the taverns across fair Norrath from bards aglib with tales of woe and the heroic fray. Are the Bloodsabres secretly in league with the newly reborn hate armies. Is Commander Kane finally preparing for his tyrannical reign of Qeynos? Will the hate armies have the sacred ore they seek from the bowels of <br>high keep at long last? All this and more to come...as the War of Hate has returned at long last.<br><br>For all those interested in joining the hate war on the sides of the light armies contact <a href="mailto:Banegrivm@aol.com">Banegrivm@aol.com</a> and for those interested in the hate army contact <a href="mailto:zyacdvarr@aol.com">zyacdvarr@aol.com</a>.<br><br>Guildwar switches WILL be thrown on a mass scale by ALL guilds involved on both sides and any and all guilds interested in the event are openly welcomed and encouraged to take part.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Banegrivm!

Tumblin brings us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>  'Twas a hot day in the Oasis of Marr when the shouting began.  I was there sunbathing, enjoying one of TumJum's finest, when my respite was interupted as insults bellowed across the beach.  It seemed a fight was going down, and when I saw the two contestants I was glad I wasn't involved.  It seemed Daldrum Oakbreak and Ahkim Sandstorm weren't to happy with eachother, and there isn't too much that would get in their way.<br> <br>  Crowds gathered and lines were drawn, supporters from each side began to buff their champion.  Following tradition, a referee was found to keep the fight fair.  Seeing a rare opprotunity I immediately called for bets to be placed.  The giants began to go at it, circling each other and throwing jabs.  The crowd roard!<br> <br>  The fight was quick, with Ahkim the victor.  As he congratulated and thanked those who stood by him we was brutally attacked and slain by Daldrum's supporters!  I took home a small moral from this...Victory though sweet, is also short.<br> <br>Tumblin<br>16th lvl Rogue<br>Lanys T'Vyl<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/dukeitout.jpg">Screenshot #1</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Tumblin!

This article was written by Jubal Kinseeker, the Guildmaster of Fennin Ro's Sterling Order of Knights guild.  Here's an excerpt:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>The most important aspect of a successful guild is their recruitment policies. Guilds should make sure that the guild and the player are compatible before allowing membership. I look down on guilds which offer open recruiting via public channels. Considering that you will spend your online time consistently with these people, you want to make sure that there is some kind of filtering process. Although this is somewhat related to the above paragraph in making sure that the guild offers what you need, it puts the responsibility of that determination on the guild management, where it should be. An alternative to this would be if the guilds have an open invite policy, but remove the undesirables quickly. I have found that slow recruitment often prevents members from being removed later. </I></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks again Jubal!

GameCenter posted a <a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/0,3,0-4278,00.html">medium-length news blurb</a> concerning the recent Sony acquisition of Verant Interactive.  This article features some of the first comments made by Brad McQuaid regarding this transition.  Here's a quote:<UL>John Smedley, Verant's current president, will assume the role of senior vice president and chief operating officer. Brad McQuaid, Verant's vice president and producer/programmer on EverQuest, told Gamecenter that "from our standpoint, very little is changing. We're becoming the new headquarters for Sony Online. <br><br>"If [the acquisition] affects anything, it'll be a positive one, because we'll have access to more talent due to Sony's resources and brand recognition. We're going to be hiring more people, absolutely." <br><br>He added, "This is the best thing to happen to Verant. Both entities share a common vision of the future of online gaming." Apparently, this includes Sony's continued interest in The Station, as McQuaid indicated that Verant has been wanting to do casual games for some time. <br><br>McQuaid said it's business as usual at Verant, including work on the upcoming online strategy epic Sovereign (due out in early 2001), and he hints, "there are rumors there may be a second official expansion pack for EverQuest that may be out before Sovereign." Though McQuaid would not confirm, Verant says its highly anticipated Star Wars online role-playing game should be out by the end of next year as well. </UL>

While browsing through the pages of the Gameplay Board, I stumbled across the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048557.html">following post</a> that Sony Online's Gordon Wrinn replied to:<UL>It is well known that there is double-exp loss associated with post-hell levels (31, 36, 41, 46). I suspect there is a bug somewhere, however; consider the following scenario:<br>-----------------------------------<br><br>A char is L44, and notices that when they die they lose about 1/2 bubble of exp. They make it to L45 (a proven 'hell' level, taking about 2x exp to get through) and when they die they see 1/4 bubble loss, which is expected since the bubbles represent double the exp of a normal level. They then level on to L46; when they die; they lose about 1 1/4 bubbles. When they make L47, exp loss is back to about 1/2 bubble per death.<br><br>Here is the rub: if a char dies just after making L46, they will lose a full 1 1/4 bubbles in level *45*. Since L45 is a double-exp level, they have lost 2 1/2 bubbles of exp (half a level) with a single death. This 'quadruple penalty' seems to be a bug, as they lose much more exp in L45 if they die at the beginning of L46 than if they die in L45 itself.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>So...bug or design? I understand that we should not be so concerned by numbers, but a half-level of exp in a single death seems *quite* severe.<br><br>I see good reason to require more exp to go through the hell levels. However, I don't see why post-hell levels should have the extreme penalties for dying that they do. The penalties do not serve to keep groups of friends leveling at the same pace, but rather frustrate a single player who dies at the wrong time.<br><br><i>Experience loss is calculated as a percentage of total experience, not the experience required for a current level. The number of bubbles that are lost really doesn't matter. This is just the way that the math works out. You don't lose a higher percentage of total experience, it just happens to be a higher percentage of experience required for the current level. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon killed two birds with one stone this evening by writing a large message that tackled several different subjects in one post.  Here's the information:<UL>Hello all,<br><br>There are a few issues that are on the boards in multiple threads, so I thought I'd address them in one post:<br><br><b><i>-TZ/VZ Moves-</b></i><br><br>We'll be opening the /movelog command on TZ and VZ this Friday and leaving it open through Monday for move mid next week between those two servers. Specific's will be posted in the patch message tomorrow morning. If you can point out any issues that you think should be covered in the patch, please follow up in this thread.<br><br>In regards to possible moves or looting changes for RZ, none are planed or likely. RZ was created at a different time than the two other servers, and has maintained its ruleset since release. Though we tried out the loot idea on TZ, our desire is to keep Rallos as it is at present. <br><br><b><i>-Shrink Potion-</b></i><br><br>We'll be giving the shrink potion (created via alchemy) the ability to shrink the user anywhere in the near future. It will be announced in the patch message when it goes in. I can't say for certain whether this will be tomorrow or whether it will be held off until the next item patch at the moment.<br><br><b><i>-Spell Drop Rates-</b></i><br><br>We'll be increasing them, but do want to maintain a rate at which they are still desired drops, and not loot that you just destroy because it's taking up space in your backpack.<br><br><b><i>-Alchemy Prices-</b></i><br><br>We'll be adjusting these, making it alchemy less expensive. It won't be in tomorrows patch, but probably in the one after that.<br><br><b><i>-Poison-</b></i><br><br>Still looking good for an end-of-june implementation.<br><br><b><i>-Clipping Plane-</b></i><br><br>Several months ago some people complained that they were no longer able to adjust the clipping plane out as far as they had been. We've gone through all of the zone headers and put the "Maximum Clip" out as far as the data export would allow. This is already live and we've been unable to find any problems.<br><br>-Gordon</UL>

Catalyst sends word that <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo/">Ask Milo on EverLore</a> has been updated with new Q&A from Milo D. Cooper.  The big issue talked about today was the female player models.  Here's a short clip from that segment:<UL>I have noticed that ALL the player characters have the physiques of Greek gods. All the women are busty, leggy and thin, all the men are broad-shouldered, lean and ready to walk the runway in front of Versace (granted Trolls, Ogres, Halflings, etc. are an exception, but you get the idea). Why did Verant make this decision? I would think that it would make the world more colorful and diverse to actually have characters who were fat, skinny, or just plain ugly. I understand and accept that EQ is a fantasy world, but I think that the best fantasy is extrapolated from reality, and is thus believable and transporting. I was curious if the decision to make EQ a world of only beautiful people was rooted in technical constraints? Love of beauty? What?<br><br><B>It's been reported so many times that it should be common knowledge in the EQ community, by now: more than anyone else, it was Rosie (a woman) who pushed for player characters with tight, hard bodies and healthy endowments. She says that she did that because, in a fantasy world, most people are going to want to be Venuses and Adonises. That sounds reasonable to me.</b></UL>

Published recently on the St. Paul Pioneer Press is a new article entitled <a href="http://www.pioneerplanet.com/tech/docs/tech1.htm">Caught on the Net</a>.  This studies EverQuest and games like it online and some of the social effects it has on certain people.  Here's a clip:<UL>Lori Gilbert began playing EverQuest in earnest after quitting her job at a nuclear power plant, a move the couple had decided upon as part of their plans to have children, her husband said.<br><br>At first, Dan Gilbert saw nothing unusual, but after a few months he began to notice bowls and plates beside her computer when he came home, a sign that she had been playing all day. When he went to bed, she would still be playing and sometimes she'd still be at it when he awoke. Friends began to worry about her health.<br><br>``That was her life,'' Dan Gilbert said. ``I didn't say anything because, at that point, I was just so disgusted.''<br><br>All the things they had done together in the past -- working on the house, gardening, watching television and just talking -- had stopped.<br><br>Dan eventually issued his ultimatum, and Lori closed her EverQuest account.</UL>Thanks Zaerin!

Gedden brings us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>After six months of waiting, my Character Gedden Honorblade on the<br>Tunare server was able to complete a GM quest. Gedden did wind up being<br>approached by a Herald of Marr, and given the gift of a Deepwater<br>Breastplate.<UL><LI><a href="http://web2.airmail.net/art/DWBP.gif">Screenshot #1</a></UL>This Quest started with the Original apperance of Layns T'Vyl. After<br>consecutive days of dueling over 6 months ago, avraging a total of six<br>hours dueling, Gedden was promised by the gods a final confrontation.<br><br>On Sunday, June 4th, Gedden was able to confront Lanys for this battle.<br>Lanys T'Vyl, who is the daughter of Inny himself, was very rude and<br>abrupt. After a good twenty minutes of heated converstaion, Lanys<br>attacked Gedden. She charmed a near-by human caster who then attacked<br>Gedden.<br><br>The low armored caster did little good againt Gedden in melee combat, a<br>paladin of Marr who wields a Fiery avenger. The caster was nearly<br>totally cut down and killed in two or three rounds. The charmed and<br>probally very scared caster then got a heal from Lanys who at the same<br>time hit Gedden with what I can only describe as an Ice based attack<br>which did just under 1500 dammage. Gedden then rooted the helpless<br>charmed human caster and backed off to heal himself. The caster then<br>began to burn Gedden from afar. However he decided not to kill a<br>helpless chamred caster, and was able to eat all the dammage from the<br>caster and heal himself with little worry.<br><UL><LI><a href="http://web2.airmail.net/art/GED.GIF">Screenshot #2</a></UL>By this time Lanys was Enraged, and confronted Gedden, and cast on him<br>directly.

She would start to<br>lose, then invul herself and would seemingly regen to full instantly.<br>She was not doing much dammage to the players either. Gedden could out<br>manuver her all to easlily, and was laying waste to her in melee rounds.<br>The small ammout of dammage he was taking would be compensated by his<br>friends who would Gheal him.<br><br>Lanys cast an area effect Death toutch spell, which killed off nearly<br>everyone around her. There were a few players, Gedden included, who<br>actually resisted this spell. Anohter 15 min of fighting occured, Lanys<br>knew that she could not win a battle againt the rightous. She gave<br>Gedden a direct Death Toutch, and he fell.<br><br>Under an hour later, Gedden was wandering the commons area near Neriak.<br>When he heard lanys was in Kithcor.<br><UL><LI><a href="http://web2.airmail.net/art/HOM.GIF">Screenshot #3</a></UL><br>As he ran, he shouted: Marr, Help me defeat her!<br><br>Suddenly, a Herald of Marr appeared before him and said: He has heard of<br>you...
