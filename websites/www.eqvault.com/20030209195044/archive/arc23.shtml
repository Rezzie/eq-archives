The changes that took place Monday are still being talked about and clarified.  In the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000340.html">following excerpt</a> Alan addresses Aelfgar's concerns:<UL><b>I am still just a little confused... maybe you can clarify this. From what I have read, the change in resistance it two-fold: first, casters over 51 have a better chance of landing DD's on any mob; and second, certain high level mobs have either had their resistances lowered, or made more specific, so they will have high resistance to certain kinds of spells only... is that correct? If it is, I haven't really noticed the first change yet (dd's seem to be hitting Spiders in VL about the same (3/5th of the time full, 1/5 full resist, 1/5 partial resist), and Spirocs and Raptors in Timorous Deep seem to be on par with this too. I haven't had the chance to try out any uber mobs though... in the next couple of days I will have a chance to try it on Venril Sathir, though, hehe.<br><br>Aelfgar Raintree<br>Level 52 Channeler of Morrel-Thule</b><br><br>The reduced resistances will be more noticeable the higher level the NPC is. You might not see a dramatic change until you try out some of those 'uber' encounters. That's where the problem with resistances existed, not with the lower level NPCs.<br><br>I urge you all to read over the comments we've provided carefully before submitting questions. We tried very hard to explain all this as clearly as we can. The answers to most of the questions I am getting have been given already.<br><br>Alan</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Alan VanCouvering <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000348.html">unleashed some important news</a> on the Developer's Corner.  Catch the full story here:<UL>In the next month or so, prior to the release of EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin, we will be moving to DirectX 8. This will be true not just for those purchasing Shadows of Luclin, but for everyone playing EverQuest. <br><br>In fact, some time soon, prior to the new interface rollout, we will be giving everyone the DirectX 8 version of the graphics engine dll. This will give players the option of using the new dll to help us find any hardware incompatibilities prior to the time we move to DirectX 8 game-wide. We'll be testing as many configurations as we possibly can in-house, but with the huge number of possible hardware configurations we can't test them all. The plan here is to nail the problems down now and have as many of you updated to DirectX8 as soon as we can before we make the switchover. <br><br>Why are we doing this? Well, you'll need it to use the new interface and we need it for all of the good things it lets us do for the game, primarily improving framerates (yes, even in the old world and even if you don't buy Shadows of Luclin). For a good idea of the new features we'll be able to implement with DirectX 8, check out our latest <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/main/indev.jsp">In Development</a> (the EVERQUEST TECH DOCUMENT at the bottom). <br><br>Upgrading to DirectX 8 is pretty simple. Here's what you do: <br><br>1) Download DirectX 8.0a. Store it in a directory so you can find it when you need it in a few minutes, <b>but don't install it yet</b>. You can find them on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp">Microsoft's site</a>. Make certain to get the driver that is appropriate for your operating system. <br><br>2) Locate the most recent drivers for you video card and download them into the same folder (this makes them easier to find). Don't install these yet either. <b>Do this even if you have the latest drivers installed</b>. If they have a text file with installation instructions, you might want to get that too (or print it out). <br><br>3) Locate the most recent drivers for you sound card and download them into the same folder. Again, <b>don't install these yet</b>, and go ahead and download them even if you have the latest drivers installed. You might also want to get any installation instructions for the drivers. You're going to need to reinstall them shortly, so it's best to have them on hand. <br><br>4) Set your video adapter to the Standard Display Adapter (VGA)<br>The steps required to do this will probably vary for each of you a little bit. But here are the steps I followed to change this on my computer <b>(keep in mind that I am using Win 98 and the procedure will be different if you're using Win 2k or XP)</b>:<br>a) Click Start, then Settings, then Control Panel.<br>b) Double Click on Display<br>c) Click on the Settings Tab. Then click on the Advanced Button.<br>d) Click on the Adapter Tab, then choose Change.<br>e) Click Next.<br>f) Select the radial button (the little circle) next to the option for Display a list of all drivers and click Next.<br>g) Select the button next to the option for Show all hardware.<br>h) Scroll to the top of the list and select (standard display types). Then from the window on the right choose standard display adapter (VGA) and click Next.<br>i) It will ask you if you really, really want to use this adapter. Choose yes. <br><br>5) Now install DirectX 8.0a by finding it in your folder and double clicking it. Follow the instructions for installation. <br><br>6) NOW you need to reinstall your video drivers. Use the new ones that you saved in that folder. Follow the instructions for installation given by the manufacturer. <br><br>7) Install the latest sound drivers for you sound card, also following the instructions given by the manufacturer. <br><br>That should be it. You may want to reboot after this if the last driver installation didn't already force you to do it, just to make sure. <br><br>NOTE: It is important to reinstall the latest video <b>and</b> sound drivers <b>after</b> you install DX 8. <br><br>Yes, if you read that carefully you noticed that I said something about a new interface. We will be releasing a new and impressively customizable interface to all EverQuest players with the release of Shadows of Luclin. I don't have a lot of details for you about the new interface at this time. I can tell you that we think you'll be very impressed with it. The main feature of this new interface will be the customizability that it gives the players. We're still building it, so I can't really elaborate, but there is no doubt in my mind that you'll be impressed, or in the least intrigued. :)<br><br>We wanted to let you know about this as soon as we could to give you as much time as possible to make the upgrade. Please consider updating to DirectX 8.0a as soon as possible. EverQuest runs fine with DirectX 8 now, so you shouldn't see any problems running EverQuest after the update. <br><br>We will be double-checking our audio and video support page to make certain that it is up to date. If you need help with audio or video problems, including finding a driver for your cards and identifying your cards, check out our <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/audio_video/index.jsp">Audio and Video Support</a> page. <br><br>Alan</UL>

Chrysania Kiga'rasku brings us word of the demise of the Brethren of the Mystic Dawn guild:<BLOCKQUOTE>I look out my office window on the courtyard below.

We have walked<br>the Planes together with Family and friends.<br><br>We held the BBBB in the Arena, made many many friends. We shared tales of<br>amazing feats and even our share of defeats.  The Brethren became a tight<br>night family.  Together we laughed and cried. I managed to make more then a<br>few of you enjoy good ale.<br><br>Today, as I watch the sun set on the peaks of Highpass, I realize that the<br>Brethren of the Mystic Dawn have also reached their twilight.  It is high<br>time that I take off my mantle of Avatar.  It is time that the Brethren of<br>the Mystic Dawn become a part of History.<br><br>The Brethren of the Mystic Dawn will close its Headquarters. I shall pack my<br>desk and all in it.

The melee changes that went into the last patch received some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000346.html">additional clarification</a> from Alan.  Here's the two posts from the Developer's Corner:<UL>Obviously there have been plenty of questions regarding the changes to melee and magic post 50 that we introduced with the last patch. The man with his hands on the pulse of the melee changes is Rich Waters. He was instrumental in figuring out what needed to be done and implementing the needed changes, so it's probably best that he be the one to answer questions about those changes. <br><br><b>Hi there ! <br><br>Just a quick question: <br><br>When i saw the changes, i was very happy to see that my Shadow Knight could more damage at last........But now after playing and reading your reply's to some questions, i notice a flaw in it.....You stated that 2H weapons dmg is increased AFTER 51...But in your comment, that SK and Paladins will move to the same dmg table as the Warrior, you didn't make your self clear if this is from level 1 or level 51.....Fighting a blue con Mob yesterday after the patch made no difference for me....At 43 i still miss most of the time and thats the reason i quit playing my SK.....NOW i read that these table changes are in effect after level 51 ???? <br><br>I think a lott of SK and Paladins will be disappointed in this... </b><br><br>--------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Before level 51, paladins, shadowknights, and bards are all on the same damage table as warriors, and always have been. This patch, we changed it so that they remain on the same table all the way up to level 60. Just to make sure this is clear, here is a list of classes- <br><br>Pre-level 51 there are two damage tables, the "standard table" and the "high damage table"<br><b>1-50 Standard Table</b> - Warrior, Rogue, Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger, Bard<br><b>1-50 High Damage Table</b> - Monk <br><br>Before this patch when characters hit level 51, some of them would move to a higher table. This is how things were prior to this latest melee patch.<br><b>51+ Standard Table</b> - Paladin, Shadowknight, Bard<br><b>51+ High Damage Table</b> - Monk, Warrior, Rogue, Ranger <br><br>With this patch, we added two new totally new damage tables, and moved classes around a bit. Here is how things are on live servers right now-<br><b>51+ Standard Table</b> - No one.<br><b>51+ High Damage Table</b> - Warrior, Rogue, Ranger, Paladin, Shadowknight, Bard<br><b>55+ Monk Table</b> - Monk<br><b>60+ Monk Table</b> - Monk <br><br>Also, please note that damage tables are not always a big damage increase. Moving from the standard table to the high damage table is a fairly large increase, but moving from the high damage table to the 55+ monk table is only a small increase. <br><br>Another important thing to know about damage tables is this - they only affect the amount of damage you do. Damage tables do not affect the chance to hit or miss a monster, your weapon skills, or anything except the amount of damage you do. Damage tables specifically affect your average damage per hit and how high your hardest hits can be. <br>--------------------------------------<br><br><b>Ummm, So basicly what it said is that SK and Paladins move to the warrion table from level 1 on. It doesn't say anything about from level 51 ? And isn't it a bit strange that before level 51 i do only 50% of a warrior's damage ? Why don't give us BEFORE level 51 the same damage table ? That would balance the SK and Paladins for real.....even at 43 a warrior is always picked before a SK and a paladin (beter yet a Paladin is picked BEFORE a SK always since the can heal !) <br><br>There would be nothing unbalacing to this if SK and Paladins would be at 75% damage from level 1 upward to level 60 ? Can you at least think about this ? <br><br>Gravel Blacksoul,<br>Human Knight of Bertoxxulous. </b><br><br>--------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>The reason that these changes all took place from level 51 and up, is because we feel that the game and classes are well balanced from levels 1-50 and have been for a long time now. From level 1-50, knight classes do the right amount of damage and have an appropriate amount of other skills and abilities to balance them out against other classes. Even in the low 50s, the classes stay relatively balanced. It's only as they pass 55th level that things were getting unbalanced, so that is where we targeted our changes. <br><br>Also, saying a shadowknight only does half as much damage as a warrior pre-50 is not very accurate. If you compare a shadowknight and a warrior with similar quality gear in those levels, you will find it's much closer than that - even before you include your pet and the spell damage you can do. Shadowknights have always been a very viable class, and now don't suffer from a lack of melee damage at the highest levels. <br><br>One of our main goals with this patch was to bring melee classes at 60th level back to the relative balance they had at level 50. I think we've done this, and that you will find the results quite balanced once you have some time to get used to things again. <br><br>- Rich Waters <br>--------------------------------------<br><br>Thanks Rich. <br><br>Alan</UL>A little later Alan added this to the thread:<UL>I have a little more information for you: <br><br><b>I believe you guys did a great job with the upgrading, however I do feel you fell short in one spot. Paladin and Shadow Knight epics seem to have been effectivly killed in this patch. <br><br>I play a shadow knight I have my epic and personally I felt sick to my stomach. <br><br>Innoruuk's curse is possibly one of the most long involved epics you can do, based on rare drops of rare spawns and visits to all three planes. <br><br>I can understand not changing the epic prowess of Rogue/Ranger etc epics due to the damage they dealt with dual wield. However, because of the old combat system the shadow knight and paladin epics fell far behind the others in "epic" status. Now with the new upgraded 2handers and 1handers most of the sentiment I am feeling from my community is. "Why bother?" "Why did I even bother my EPIC weapon is now a decoration." <br><br>Truely I feel an epic weapon should take back seat to drops in zones such as Temple of Veeshan or Sleeper's tomb, but I feel a small upgrade to the epics themselves would make them desirable again, they are epic aren't they? </b><br><br>--------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Far from killing the effectiveness of knight epics, we actually improved the damage they do by a large amount. This seems to be a common misconception with the new melee patch, and one that's important to clear up. This question is really more about the quality of two-handed weapons than it is about paladins and shadowknights, but it's important since they have two-handed epics. <br><br>When we decided to upgrade two-handed weapons, we looked at both the formula we were using to calculate damage, and also the two-handed weapons available to players. When we looked at epics in particular, we took the amount of damage a warrior would do if he was dual wielding his epic sword pair. Our research showed that this was a good, balanced amount of damage for an epic weapon, so we used it as a basis for comparing the other epics. <br><br>We applied this information to tune our two-handed damage formula, until we were happy with the amount of damage a shadowknight or a paladin was doing with his epic, when compared to the dual epic wielding warrior. The result was an increase in damage done with the knight epics, without needing to change the damage/delay stats on them. You should see that you are doing significantly more damage now with your two-handed epic than you were before the patch, and this increases the closer you get to level 60. Epics did not need their damage/delay stats changed, because they are doing appropriate damage with just the new two-handed damage formula we implemented. <br><br>You've probably read by now that a few very powerful two-handed weapons had their damage/delay stats improved this patch. The reason for this is pretty simple: post-epic quality one-handed weapons were available that had much better damage/delay stats than epic weapons, but the two-handed weapons available after epics did not improve much. For example, if we made a one-handed sword that did 20% more damage than a warrior epic, we should include two-handed swords that do 20% more damage than a SK epic to keep things balanced. So, some of the very rare and powerful two-handed weapons in the game got a boost in stats, to put them on par with the one-handed weapons available in the same areas. <br>--------------------------------------<br><br><b>Also I'm curious as to how this Damage Bonus system works.<br>Paladin epic has 40 delay w/ 23 damage bonus <br>Innoruuk's Cuse has 45 delay w/ 24 damage bonus <br>Nature's Defender is 46 delay w/ 29 damage bonus <br>what am I missing here? <br><br>Anyways thanks for the upgrades even if you don't boost epic prowess I feel you did a good job. <br><br>Zerous </b><br><br>--------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I'll go over damage bonuses more fully in another post, but here's the answer to this question. Damage bonuses are based on the delay of the weapon and the level of the person using it. The damage bonuses you listed were not all from the same level character. At level 60, those weapons actually have these damage bonuses listed on them- <br><br>Fiery Defender (40 delay) 23 point damage bonus<br>Innoruuk's Curse (45 delay) 27 point damage bonus<br>Nature's Defender (46 delay) 29 point damage bonus <br><br>You can see that weapons with larger delays also gain larger damage bonuses. <br><br>- Rich Waters <br>--------------------------------------<br><br>Thanks for your questions Zerous, and thanks for the answers Rich. <br><br>Alan</UL>

Alan add this update to the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000340.html">Combat and Spell System Enchancement</a> thread on the Developer's Corner:<UL>Elans_corpse0 wrote: <br><br><b>I read in your latest response that none of the global resist changes have any effect for damage over time spells. <br><br>Perhaps I am missing something, but it seems that the Necromancer class is largely left out from these beneficial changes since 90% of their offensive spells are DoT. Can you help me out here and show me what I'm missing? </b><br><br>Sure. <br><br>All high level casters have benefited rather dramatically from the change to magic that we made, even if they don't primarily cast direct damage spells. <br><br>We made several changes, reducing the resistance of high level NPCs to direct damage spells was just one of them. We also reduced resistances in general for many of those high level NPCs, making it so that all sorts of spells will land more easily. Let me isolate the important paragraph for you here: <br><br><i>NPCs now have less of a chance to resist any direct damage spell caused by casters above level 50. Super-high level NPCs have received a large reduction in the level-difference bonus they receive to their resists based upon the level of the attacking player character. <b>We&#8217;ve increased the effectiveness of resist debuffs against a large number of higher level NPCs in regard to damage spells being cast upon them. We&#8217;ve also reduced the resistances on a wide range of NPCs, especially for NPCs in Velious.</b> Finally, we&#8217;ve given our designers more control over the ability to customize any particular encounter. For example previously, if a designer didn&#8217;t want a creature to be mesmerisable, he had to give it high magic resistance. Now they can set that feature individually while keeping magic resists reasonable so they don&#8217;t take a bunch of classes out of the picture through the need for one feature. </i><br><br>Overall, from reading the class-specific boards, I think all casters are seeing how useful this change has been for them. You might want to dig up the URL for a necromancer site and see what your fellow gravediggers think&#8230; :)<br><br>Alan</UL>

Alan talked about the new stuff in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000340.html">Combat and Spell System</a> in the thread Gordon created last week.  Here's the scoop:<UL>Jvaldezjr wrote: <br><br><b>I have a question in regard to potential 1 hand weapon changes being made in the future. Will there be a list released about what specific weapons have changed?? Also, for knights that have a weapon, and a change was made to it, will it need to be switched out with a GM in game? </b><br><br>Considering that we have never posted the stats on those weapons in the first place, we won't be posting stats for the changed weapons either. That's the sort of information you can get by playing the game. Existing weapons that change should change automatically, no trade-ins should be needed. <br><br>Psten wrote: <br><br><b>This seems to only effect melee characters from levels 51 - 60, is this true?</b> <br><br>Yes, these changes will only affect characters (both melee and casters, the caster change is rather significant, it just took fewer words to explain) over 50th level for the most part. The game is pretty well balanced up to level 50, and we don't see any real need to change the mechanics of the game for the levels that are balanced. <br><br>-Snuggles-4-King wrote: <br><br>--------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>we gave rangers an innate offensive bonus beginning at level 55, and increasing until level 60. This has the net effect of allowing them to double attack a bit more often, and hit harder on successful attacks. These two changes put the ranger exactly where we want him, doing approximately the same damage as a similarly equipped warrior. <br><br>We are raising the Defense skill cap for rangers a few points each level until it caps at 220. We are also raising the ranger's Riposte skill cap to 185 starting at level 51 and scaling up to level 60. <br>--------------------------------<br><br>I think i can speak for all rangers around norrath when i say : <br><br>Marry me. I love you. <br><br>After many many moons of being mocked, i think the ranger class may finally be balanced :)<br><br>I'll assume that your request for marriage was for Gordon rather than me. I'll pass it on&#8230; :)<br><br><b>Regarding the spell system and being a Cleric, I do have one question. <br><br>When it comes to my role to actively engage the monsters (when I am not desperately needed to only heal people :) ) I and many Clerics with me usually load up some form of Stun spell. <br><br>Except for the lowest-level Stun spell we get, all Stuns have a DD component. When a check is made to resist these spells, it is made separately for the DD component, and the stun effect, and if either is resisted, the spell is fully resisted. At least, that was up until now. <br><br>How will Stuns with a DD component now work? Also, is purely the Stun effect also considered as "DD" in this aspect, in that it might be easier for characters at 50+ to land Stuns now? <br><br>- Kaysha Soulsinger<br>Vicar in the 52nd Circle of Erollisi Marr </b><br><br>It is very unlikely that we'll be changing the basic nature of the way that combination spells like that work. Even though we haven't completed the spell casting examinations, I'm pretty sure that they will still be more likely to be resisted than single component spells. <br><br>We changed two things here, though. We reduced the innate resistance that NPCs had at high levels to direct damage spells. This was a rather sweeping change, as it was changed in code and will affect all NPCs that are 'super high level'. This change, though, only affects direct damage spells, not combination spells that have a direct damage component or things like damage over time spells. <br><br>But the other change we made was to specific NPCs. Those that we've fiddled with and lowered their resistances should be easier to hit with spells of all types. Now there weren't a lot of NPCs that received this reduction, but there were several. We'll continue to look at specific NPCs for further changes. <br><br><b>I'm pretty sure someone else has probably submitted this already but in this patch you said each 2 handed weapon would show the damage bonus on the weapon due to the delay. I've checked a few different 2hs, 2hb, 2hp weapons and I haven't seen a "Damage Bonus" stat on it. Is this something that was forgotten or was it just not worked in? <br><br>Falkahnhan </b><br><br>You need to be able to equip the weapon to see the bonus. If you can equip it, you should see the bonus listed on the weapon stats. <br><br>Gramercy wrote: <br><br><b>Re: Spell system changes <br><br>I cannot begin to tell you how great these changes are! Kudos to you all. <br><br>Immune messages alone would reduce caster frustration tremendously. Then, as icing on the cake, you added the capabilities to fine-tune which spells affect which NPCs, which I see as a positive change. <br><br>After the patch, we fought an "ubermob" and, although it was still un-slowable, it was refreshing to try some of my other spells and see them work ! The cries of joy over /guildsay from other class's spellcasters showed me that I was correct in viewing this change as a positive one. <br><br>Thanks again! </b><br><br>Thanks! <br><br>That's pretty much the result (and response :)) that we were looking for. <br><br>Jhade_Bard wrote: <br><br><b>A 240 cap on piercing, but slashing and blunt 250 cap for Bard classes? Excuse me, but WHY?! <br><br>As a bard, i love my little piercing weapons, i sometimes wish the epic was piercing. I dont want to weild fat and ugly weapons. This is a matter of choice. With this change, that choice is being limited. <br><br>I always thought a bard rogue-ish in nature.(sneak/hide/safe fall/pick locks) Why on earth would the primary weapon skill of one of the bards parent classes, be diminished below the other weapon skills available to a bard? We become too rogue like?<br><br><br>Please.. consider the poor piercing skill be capped wih the rest of the skills. Lets not forget there is an epic-like dagger ( sirens song ) at the high end encounter area. Please do not deminish this weapon and others that are piercing, any further than it already is. ( p.s. its proc is useless. ) <br><br>some bards like piercing, some like slashing, others like blunt. Please dont tell me now at 60th, you think bards should like slashing and blunt over piercing. </b><br><br>Only the rogue has a piercing cap of 250. I could, rather easily, justify raising the piercing skill cap of any melee or hybrid class to 250 with little effort. Warriors are masters of weapons, they should have a 250 piercing cap. Rangers are quick and agile, they should be as good as anyone with piercing weapons&#8230; <br><br>It comes down to two things. First, without that cap increase bards are where we want them for damage dealing. There is no balance need to increase it. And we have decided to leave rogues as with the best cap for piercing. <br><br>I've read a few of the post made by bards to the bard sites (yes, I read a LOT of message boards at work, just like I used to when I worked elsewhere&#8230; :) ). The main reason I see given for wanting a 250 cap for piercing is that, well, the other weapon skill caps are at 250. I'm sorry, but that's not really a good reason. I know this is going to sound like some sort of threat, I assure you it is not (and I'm not happy that I feel a need to qualify a statement like that, as I don't threaten people&#8230;), but if even skill levels is all you want then it's just as valid to ask that they all be evened out at 240 so that a bard has equal reason to use all three types of weapon. <br><br>There is some sense behind the argument that bards are partly rogues, as you mentioned, and that there are indeed some notable bard-only piercing weapons at the higher end. And these are interesting points. But we've decided to leave the cap at 240 and leave rogues with the 'bonus' of being the only class with a cap that high in piercing. <br><br>Will this keep bards from using their piercing weapons when they reach the 240 cap? I don't think so. You were using them when you had a cap significantly lower (225? I don't remember). There's still a notable improvement in the cap, greater than the 10 points it is lower than the rogue cap. If a bard want to use a piercing weapon, I don't think the slightly lower cap will be a deterrent. <br><br>Basically, there is no compelling balance reason to raise it over 240. I certainly understand the psychological effects, but those weren't part of the balancing equation. I'm sorry if that upsets some bard players. <br><br><b>Two things I wanted to comment on here: <br><br>One is the mention of the Singing Steel Shortsword for bards. I am thrilled that Bards get such a great epic weapon, but please remember that not all high level bards are supposed to have them, so they shouldn't be seen as a balancing item, accept against other epics. <br><br>As it stands now, the ability to melee *and* get enhanced songs through the SSS is an amazing difference between the epified and un-epified bard, one that cannot be duplicated by spells cast by other team members. For example, the haste components of some epics are redundant when an Enchanter is in the group - nothing makes the song enhancing effects of the SSS redundant unless the bard simply doesn't melee. <br><br>Please don't even consider nerfing the SSS out of this, but I would recommend adding a couple of magic weapons in the high end that had a lesser, but still noticeable boost then the SSS. Perhaps even having them instrument specific: Jonthan's Whistling Warstick for wind, Selo's Steel Drum Shield for percussion (if it still enhanced DoTs, it would be worth losing Dual Wield), etc.<br> <br>Also, I just want to remind you that reducing resists against DDs will lessen the value of Wizard Lures, unless you aren't changing raid encounters. Some of the damage numbers on the non-wizard folk are pretty high, it is my understanding that Lures are still important to high level wizards. <br><br>Mike </b><br><br>I understand. The change made to the bard epic was made based on the weapon itself, not as some method to balance out bardic spell (song) abilities. It's more about allowing the bard more freedom to use other weapon combinations than anything else. Song balance will be looked at separately. <br><br>As for Lures, I don't think that will happen. There is a difference between reducing the resistances and removing them completely. Lures will still be as unresistable as they are now. Their efficiency against highly resistant NPCs will continue. Those NPCs are still highly resistant, just some of them are not so much so resistant. <br><br>And, well, if there is anyone that will benefit from a better ability to land direct damage spells, it's wizards. <br><br>Graal_ wrote: <br><br><b>Kudos! I think these changes really improve the health of the high end game, every single one of them. The melee changes are much needed and much appreciated. As a paladin, thank you. <br><br>Even more important are the changes to resists and the ability to make a mob immune to 1 line of spells without making them immune to everything on that resist. There will be many enchanters, mages, necros, and shamans singing in the streets. Maybe the high end game won't revolve quite as much around WAR/ROG/CLR, and maybe high end mobs can be tuned so that they require greatly differing tactics. <br><br>On the other hand, I am upset that the green M&M didn't get upgraded with this patch. When will the green M&Ms of Norrath see justice!? </b><br><br>I'm sorry Graal, but I have eaten all the green M&Ms&#8230; <br><br>I blame it on the donut shortage. <br><br>Wow. There were a lot of responses to these changes, so I'm sorry it took me so long to read through them all. I hope I've cleared a few things up and not made things more confusing&#8230; <br><br>Alan</UL>Alan spoke on these issues again recently in this follow-up:<UL><b>Hi, <br><br>I have a question about the 2h damage bonus. How does this work? Let me give you an example. I am a 54 Paladin using a Granite Face Grinder. This wepon does 29 damage with delay of 36. I now receive a 9 damage bonus. Does that mean the wepon operates as 38 damage and 36 delay? or does it mean 9 damage is add to each hit? I thought it would be the second, but I noticed my self hitting for 21 a few times today. Subtract 9 off that and you get 12! I never hit that low before. <br><br>Overall I LOVE the changes. You have made paladins playable post 50!!!!!! WTG <br><br>Samin Soulsaver </b><br><br>Your weapon already had a bonus. What we've done is increased that bonus and put the number out there for you to see. So the 9 you're seeing is the old bonus plus the increase. <br><br><b>Thank you - thank you for the explanation of how everything works as well as your expectations of the classes. Nicely done and much appreciated! That's all I have to say about it for once! :)<br><br>- Tab </b><br><br>Since I like to give credit where it is due, those explanations were written by Jahaar. He's the new guy, and we're darn glad to have him. <br><br>Alan</UL>

In regards to the new screenshots posted yesterday, Brad McQuaid fired off <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000344.html">this announcement</a> to the Developer's Corner:<UL>Hello all,<br><br>While we've recently been very pleased to have been able to release a variety of Shadows of Luclin screen shots, we've simply not yet been at a point where we could truly show off the new character engine.<br><br>Well, the time is now here :) We've just now posted 12 brand new shots showing not only new zones, but a variety of the new character models with different clothing and weapons worn. While the few character shots we'd released earlier (for example, the gnome male and the barbarian female) were early and in-progress, these models are much closer to release status.<br><br>We think they look pretty amazing and hope you all agree as well. Please check out the first batch at:<br><br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/screenshots.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/screenshots.jsp</a><br><br>And then look for another batch on various web news sites either tomorrow or the next day.<br><br>Let us know what you think!<br><br>thanks,<br><br>-Brad<br><br>ps. one item of note is the Dark Elf Female's hair -- you'll see that she has a variety of tints. Well, the new engine allows us to do this, but what do you all think of it? It does vary from the traditional white -- is this good or bad? Let us know.</uL>A follow-up was then posted today:<UL>Hello again,<br><br>I want to say thanks very much for all the feedback we've received since last night -- much appreciated, and very helpful.<br><br>On the whole, we've received both positive and negative responses. I'd like to comment briefly about the negativity.<br><br>First, there's certainly nothing wrong with sending it in -- we want players&#8217; true feelings about the issue. And we are listening.<br><br>Second, though, we do understand that players have built up an emotional attachment to their existing characters and their character's appearances. And this is totally normal and expected, and ultimately it's why we're keeping an option in to display the older characters if desired. We certainly realize that some players will flat out prefer to stay the way they are &#8211; after all, this is a game that's been out a while, and changing the status quo always creates controversy. It is also worth noting that the responses to the Vah Shir and the horse (as well as the backgrounds) were almost universally positive, and by and large, we feel this is because there's no point of reference and no pre-existing emotional attachment to that content (they were, by the way, created by the same art team as the other models).<br><br>That said, we absolutely want as many people to be pleased with the new models as possible, and so we will continue to make tweaks and adjustments and to issue new screen shots reflecting those changes. The characters, while nearing completion, are still very much 'work in progress.' We also hope that as you see the new characters more often, you&#8217;ll get used the changes and start to appreciate even more the details and features this new technology allows us to explore. I know personally that I was a bit shocked and taken aback when I saw the first round of Luclin characters, but now that I&#8217;ve worked with the team day after day, watched the advances, and really become used to looking at them, I just can&#8217;t go back &#8211; the older characters just pale in comparison. <br><br>Let me address what we found to be the three main areas of concern based on the feedback:<br><br>1. The faces, especially on the females. Let me assure you that not only will they continue to be tweaked, but what you saw in these shots was the first draft of faces and all but the one shot of the barbarian male swinging his sword had NO facial animations applied to them. So, one of the reasons the faces look a little bland is because they are designed to have facial animations. Also, let me also assure everyone that we will make a very real attempt to creating new faces that match in style the older faces (in addition to, hopefully, having new ones).<br><br>2. The Ogre. Yes, he's definitely different stylistically, and this is on purpose. I can't go into too many details at this point, but part of a longer term story line we are developing (starting with Luclin but going far beyond) is that the Ogres begin reverting to their former intelligence level and sophistication. Remember, this is the race that invaded the planes and challenged the council of the Rathe, after which they were summarily cursed into the stone age. Well, the idea is that they will slowly be returning to their former glory, hence their differing appearance. And while I know that may not be appealing to some, I hope you do understand our desire to move the grand history of Norrath forward and that it might affect some of the major races.<br><br>3. The 'sexyness' of some of the new females... well, honestly, this one took me a bit by surprise. In actuality, we are purposely toning down the outfits of some of the base clothing sets of the females relative to the original character set (for example, no more thongs)... in fact, the majority of clothing you'll see is probably on par with what one might encounter at the gym or workout facility and certainly more covering than a typical beach scene in Southern California. In any case, this will undoubtedly continue to be a controversial issue, but all in all, EQ is a fantasy game with exaggerated, heroic player characters, both male and female, and it will stay that way.<br><br>In summary, we will be releasing more screen shots in the near future (another batch from yesterday's run just hit several of the major gaming sites, by the way). These newer shots will focus more on the characters themselves, their options as it relates to appearances, and less on backgrounds and action.<br><br>We continue to appreciate your feedback and will do our utmost to please as many customers as it is possible while making such a significant transition and change to a 2+ year old game.<br><br>We thank you for your understanding and support,<br><br>-Brad</UL>

Another interesting event report was brought to our attention by  Snow:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings, I have a tale of adventure originating from deep within the frigid <br>lands of Velious which may prove important.  Late last night, I was crawling <br>the icy caverns of Siren's Grotto with a few guildmates of mine, when our <br>group cleric, Ninan, heard a shout echoing throughout the caverns from a <br>curious little gnome named Bagus Skuttlebottom.  I searched around but was <br>unable to find him, but soon surmised that he had made his way out into <br>Cobolt Scar.  As fast as I could I went to the entrance and caught up with <br>him just outside of the Grotto.<br><br>I questioned the this fellow, fully clad in a shiny metallic, clockwork style <br>armor, as to what he was doing and how could I assist.  He claimed to have a <br>message for Captain Nalot in Iceclad, but did not know his way there.  I <br>offered to port him there without delay, but the silly little gnome did not <br>trust in the magics that my sorcerer kind could harness, and instead chose a <br>more treacherous route of using what he called "his feet."<br><br>As my group was fully entrenched inside of the Grotto, I attempted to delay <br>Bagus and have time to go lead them out for an escort, but another valiant <br>group from "The Defiant" quickly stepped up to the task of leading him there. <br> The group's leader, a brother gnome named "Warson", wielding two glowing <br>sabres of light, began the process of clearing the path for his cautious <br>brethren.  I would have left Bagus to the capable escorting of The Defiant <br>were it not for a small problem.  You see, Bagus, being the cautious and <br>skittish messenger that he was, had a problem of going up a little too close <br>to creatures.  A nearby drake taught him a quick lesson of what most of us <br>like to call "being careful" and seeing how quickly this little guy lost <br>precious health, I decided to tag along.  A spare wizzie with full mana can <br>sometimes come in handy when you are trying to protect a curious little <br>gnome. :)<br><br>We quickly lead him over the high plateau of Cobolt Scar and then coddled him <br>whilst fully visible through the halls of SkyShrine.  With luck, most of the <br>way was cleared already, but it certainly was a tense few minutes.  Without <br>knowing what enemies this little one would attract to his side or if some <br>nefarious stalker would jump out to intercept the message, it was never <br>assured how safe we were.<br><br>In the Waking Lands we had some panther trouble and a small scuffle with the <br>giants, but at that time I became separated from the escort due to problems <br>in the ether.  I knew that Warson's group, and a smaller group led by my old <br>friend from Solusek's Eye, named Kaziel, would have no trouble keeping the <br>messenger alive so after I returned from my zoning mishap, I quickly freed my <br>guild members from the icy tunnels of Siren's Grotto and attempted to return <br>to see if I could be of any more assistance.<br><br>After searching the frigid planes of the Eastern Wastes for the escort party, <br>I eventually decided to gate to Iceclad and meet up with them there, with the <br>hope that any uber enemy of Bagus would not have jumped him before that <br>point.  I was happy to see not only Bagus, but all the escort party alive and <br>well.  We led him to the igloo of Captain Nalot and the message was delivered <br>safe and sound to the pirate captain, though the contents of the message are <br>still unknown to me.<br><br>In appreciation for the effort put forth by the others, Bagus's hands worked <br>furiously as he cleverly devised Tinker Bags (10 slot, 100% weight reduction, <br>each with 5 fireworks inside) and gave them as rewards to the 2 groups that <br>were escorting.  Though I had been there for much of the time, I felt that I <br>had let Bagus down over the last two zones and did not step up to claim any <br>credit, instead I sat back away from the group invisible just to watch what <br>would unfold.  Bagus finished up his business with the pirate captain, waved <br>good-bye to everyone and slipped away into another igloo.  Just before I was <br>going to gate away, the scrappy little gnome appeared behind me saying, <br>"Ooops, almost forgot you, Snow!"  He gave me the same Tinker bag with <br>fireworks as he did the rest, I was so happy that I accepted the gift and <br>thanked him heartily.  I then went and joined the others in celebration of a <br>job well done in Captain Nalot's igloo.<br><br>We can only thank Karana that we all made it safe and sound, but I wonder <br>what contents that message contained.  Bagus had made comments about the dark <br>ones coming for him, but I assumed he meant the Dark Elves in Warson's party. <br> Perhaps, though, it was a warning of something to come from the Western <br>Wastes?  A new Tier'Dal encampment perhaps?  Or does Captain Nalot have a new <br>task for us...I'll let you all know when I do :)<br><br>Snow, Sorceress of the 54th Circle<br>Loyal servant to Second Heaven on the Innoruuk server.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

Tarus Mor sent in this report of a recent GM event on Rodcet Nife:<BLOCKQUOTE>A hearty crew of gnomish pirates were forced ashore in Cobalt Scar when assaulted by a storm and some of the unsavory denizens of the area. Shipwrecked and low on provisions, they drew straws to determine who would attempt the long and daunting journey back to the Iceclad settlement to retrieve help. A particularly nervous little fellow, Bofas Steambotom, was lucky enough to be chosen. Beset by sirens and wyverns, he soon shouted for help and was noticed by a number of nearby adventurers. Offering their services with a generally uncharacteristic enthusiasm, the travellers set out with Bofas in tow, who muttered to himself all the way. As it turns out, the gnome had remarkable machinery which aided him in his journey. Through the citadel of Skyshrine, the Wakening Lands of Tunare and the Kromzek fortress the band hurried, always stealthy. The eastern wastelands were a welcome sight to them all, so close to their journey's end. His courage returned, Bofas proved that he was indeed a great warrior. With the Gnomish port settlement in sight, the adventurers followed Bofas as he rushed to tell Captain Nalot of his comrades plight. A rescue expedition was subsequently sent out. In thanks for their support, the pirate offered a number of gifts of Gnomish make -- all marvellously crafted.<br> <br>/OOC<br>I was bestowed a Bag of the Tinkerer, a Rebreather and Mechanized Lockpicks. Jeyda, Enderzai, Unkel and Stumbly also recieved a gift or two -- I believe just Tinkerer Bags, but I might be wrong. Honorable mentions (those who probably should have gotten something too) are Rononat, Tannaar and Yenlo. While I didn't lead (except through part of Kael) I tried hard to take advantage of the situation from a roleplaying perspective, engaging Bofas in conversation as much as I could. I have to say, this restored my faith in GM events. It's nice to know that those who make an effort to roleplay and think creatively will also be rewarded instead of merely those who simply do the required task as if it's just another "ever"quest.<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/RNGMEvent.jpg">Screenshot #1</a></UL> </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

The following is a copy of the latest patch message to be added to the EverQuest Patch Server:<UL>October 8th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*** Item Changes ***<br><br>- Increased the duration on Song of the Deep Seas (the proc on a bardic weapon) dramatically.<br><br>- Modified the effect of Feast of Blood (weapon proc) it is now a DoT lifetap<br><br>- Added a texture to Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings.<br><br>- Added Illusion: Barbarian to the Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask.<br><br><br>*** Miscellaneous Changes ***<br><br>- The last language used by your character will be stored in your eqclient.ini file when you log out. This means that if the last character you were playing was speaking Elvish, then when you log back in with any character, that character will be speaking Elvish if he can, otherwise it will be set to a default language (most often Common).<br><br><br>*** Magic System Changes ***<br><br>There is a more detailed explanation of these changes posted on our Developer's Corner. Please visit there for more details (either at www.everquest.com or <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi</a>). Here is a summary of the changes:<br><br>- The level-based spell resistance bonus inherent in super-high level NPCs has been reduced significantly.<br><br>- Several NPCs have had their resistances reduced. Each of them was examined carefully, and resistances changed as seemed appropriate. For some of these NPCs other things were changed as well to compensate for their increased susceptibility to spells, such as armor improvements or perhaps greater hit points, if needed for that NPC.<br><br>- NPCs that were highly magic resistant in order to make them immune to certain spells can now be given specific immunity to those spells. This means that they can be made immune to critical spells, as intended, and still be generally less resistant to magic. Players will receive a message similar to the one that is already given for Mesmerization spells when they cast a spell on an NPC that it is specifically immune to.<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: It is very important to note that we have not made any NPCs immune to spells that they were not already immune to. Many NPCs that were previously immune to spells due to their high innate resistance to magic have had that resistance reduced and specific immunities added. So if you see an immunity message after attempting to cast a spell on an NPC that you hadn't seen such a message from before, understand that the NPC was already immune to that spell before due to high resistances, and the only difference is that it now has lower resistances in general and specific spell immunity (which is why you are seeing the message).<br><br>*** Melee Changes ***<br><br>After extensive research, testing, and evaluation we have completed the melee portion of our class balancing. To be clear, these changes apply just to the combat aspect of melee classes. Any issues with non-combat skills, spell effects, spell selection, or non-combat aspects of classes will be evaluated in the near future. With the completion of the melee combat balancing, we will be moving onto spells and spell casting classes. <br><br>Due to the extensive nature of these changes, we can't describe them in detail here. A detailed summary will be available on our Developer's Corner message board. Please visit www.everquest.com and our forums for more information.<br><br>* Summary of Melee Changes *<br><br>- Two-Handed Weapons have been given an increased damage bonus for characters over level 50. Also, certain post-epic quality two-handers have been improved.<br><br>- Warriors have had their taunt skill cap increased to 230 at 60th level. Also, the Blades of Strategy and Tactics can now be used in either hand.<br><br>- Rogues, as the primary user of piercing weapons, will benefit from an improvement in the quality of a few existing high-end daggers. At some future date new piercing weapons will be added to the game to fill gaps in equipment availability.<br><br>- Monks will now be on an improved combat table at levels 55 and again to a better table at 60. Monks now have the ability to Triple Attack at 60th level. The minimum damage done by Flying Kick will be greatly increased for monks starting at 51st level and scaling up to level 60. We also intend to add more monk weapons in the future to fill equipment gaps.<br><br>- Rangers have their Double Attack skill cap raised to 245. They have also gained an innate offensive bonus that starts at level 55 and increases until level 60. Ranger's Defense skill cap has been raised to 220, and their Riposte skill cap has been raised to 185.<br><br>- Paladins and Shadowknights, besides the benefits they gain from the two-handed weapons change mentioned above, have also been moved to the same combat tables as warriors. In the future we intend to examine the existing one-handed weapons useable by knights for possible upgrades. We are also increasing the Taunt skill cap for these two classes to 220.<br><br>- Bards have had their 1h blunt and 1h slash skill caps increased to 250. Their piercing skill cap has been increased to 240. Their Offense skill cap has been raised to 252. Bards are also being moved to the same combat table with all the other melee and hybrid classes (save monks who have separate tables after level 55). Bards Parry skill cap has been raised to 185 as well. Finally, the Singing Shortsword can now be equipped in the off hand and still give full song enhancing benefits.<br><br>Please read the detailed explanation of these changes on our Developer's Corner message boards at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi</a><br><br><br>*** Firiona Vie (Roleplaying Preferred) server goes Live ***<br><br>Our newest special rules server is now available. Firiona Vie is designated as roleplaying preferred. There are many special rules for this server, please read over them carefully before playing. We will be keeping an updated list of these rules on our web site at <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/firionavie.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/firionavie.jsp</a> .<br><br><br>** Firiona Vie Server Feature List **<br><br>- This is a new server, not a split server. Nor will there be any transfers to this server.<br>- Characters will be wiped before the server goes Live.<br>- This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. Player) server. In other words, it's a standard 'blue' server with the same rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our servers. It is not one of the 'Zeks'. <br>- Auction restricted to city zones: Qeynos, Surefall Glade, Highkeep, Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, Halas, Neriak, Grobb, Oggok, Greater Faydark, Ak'Anon, Kaladim, Felwithe, Paineel, Cabilis, Kael and Thurgadin. <br>- Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than the caster. <br>- Each character will be assigned an "alignment" upon creation. This alignment will be described in brief on the character creation screen (in the same location that their Deity is described).<br>- Each character will be able to change their alignment once any time after they reach 10th level if they choose. A character is not required to change alignments, but may do so any time after attaining 10th level. The player will be able to chose from a list of alignments based on their race, class and deity. <br>- A character's alignment will determine whether or not they can group with other characters.<br>- A character's alignment will determine an experience bonus or penalty when grouping with other characters. <br>- A character's alignment will determine if they can cast beneficial spells on other characters (including resurrections). <br>- Language skills will improve only through group chat in the same zone and from /say. <br>- Languages will only improve 1 point each hour and will be capped at level*5+5 skill points. <br>- Common will not exist. A Human language will be added and only made easily available to certain races. <br>- One character per account. <br>- The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones. <br>- Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as newbie notes and epic weapons.<br>- Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where melee characters can bind on other servers. <br>- /emote will be language specific <br>- All characters will be /roleplay. <br>- /alignment will display the alignment of your character and probably a more detailed description of that alignment. <br><br><br>** Trivial Loot Code **<br><br>Briefly, the Trivial Loot Code works like this: If a character kills an NPC and that NPC does not give them experience, then the Trivial Loot Code takes effect. If any member of a group does not get experience for a kill, the Trivial Loot Code will take effect. The Trivial Loot Code prevents magical, lore and no-drop items from appearing on the corpse. Normal items and coins will appear on the corpse in all cases as usual.<br><br><br>For detailed information about the alignment system on the Firiona Vie server, please visit our web site: <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/firionavie.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/firionavie.jsp</a><br><br><br>** NOTE **<br><br>Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers. Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their hometowns.<br><br><br>** A Tale from Norrath **<br><br>Adventurers, glory seekers, and plunder-hungry knaves,<br><br>A few new tavern tales have been circulating from across the Deep. It appears that strife and civil unrest have once again plagued the lands of Kunark. Stories of treachery and terror within the ranks of the Sarnak have spilled forth from the mountain fortress of Chardok.<br><br>Only a few of the most cunning spies have made their way into the Sarnak hive during this brief time of turmoil, and their reports may have serious implications. The Brood of Di`zok seems to be more organized than before. Their leadership is becoming more structured... and much more brutal. Production in the mines appears to be increasing and soldiers have been amassing in great numbers.<br><br>Other tales have come from this mountain fortress as well. Terror squads and interrogators have decimated the ranks of reported Sarnak traitors. These squads have been working under the leadership of one of the Sarnak Collective's newest council members, Korucust. It can only be presumed that this cleansing is another step towards strengthening the foul brood.<br><br>These tales are hard to confirm, since many of your adventurous kind are prone to drink and to the occasional mistruth. If these tales are true, it would only stand to reason that new dangers may reveal new wealth and glory. Perhaps it is time for you to gather your best gear, finish your mug of ale, and head out to investigate.<br><br>Good luck adventurers.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

GameZNet has published a <a href="http://mmo.gameznet.com/articles/mmorpgcomparison.shtml">comparison of all the major MMORPGs</a> on the market right now.  The comparison includes EverQuest and we see how it measures up to other titles.  Here's the introduction to the article:<UL>It has been a couple of years since I last did one of these. With the release of Dark Age of Camelot a mere three days away and Anarchy Online now over three months in to release I decided that it was time. It should be stressed that this comparison is only the opinions of one man, myself. Some areas covered here are subjective but I have done my best to give a fair and accurate comparison.<br><br>Not all MMORPG's are covered in depth here. The primary games covered are the big five: Ultima Online, Everquest, Asheron's Call, Anarchy Online and Dark Age of Camelot. We are aware that there are a number of other MMORPG's out on the market, and that some of them such as Lineage: The Bloodpledge are very popular in certain markets. Unfortunately not having had a chance to play these games extensively we have left them out of the comparison.</UL>

The patch scheduled to go in this Monday will bring much change to the spell and combat systems.  Gordon Wrinn stopped by the Developer's Corner to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000340.html">give us the lowdown</a>:<UL>Hello all,<br><br>It's been a while since I stopped by the corner to chat with everyone. Today I'm pleased to announce the specifics of the combat system enhancements mentioned last week. The changes described in the document below represent weeks of work by the team to define and quantify the issues facing players, particularly those level 51 and above. Suffice it to say that through the use of our new, highly robust combat simulation engine we've found a number of problems present that we're happy to address. <br><br>It is very important to that everyone know that these changes came about through a complete team effort, though special thanks goes out to our newest game designer, Rich Waters, who helped to pull them together and authored much of the document below. <br><br>Enjoy the read!<br><br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Associate Producer<br>EverQuest Live and Expansions<br>Sony Online Entertainment<br><br>----------SNIP----------<br><br><b>---ABOUT THE CHANGES IN GENERAL---</b><br><br>It is very important to us that our players understand our goals when making these changes. First and foremost, our goal is NOT to make any particular high-level encounter easier, nor the game easier as a whole. Our goal is that the group makeup at those high-level encounters become more diverse, with more classes, ideally all of them, feeling that they can contribute meaningfully to most encounters. Obviously there will always be some encounters where a particular classes utility should be greatly negated, but those should be the exception and included as a matter of story, rather than the rule.<br><br><br><b>---MELEE SYSTEM CHANGES---</b><br><br>After extensive research, testing, and evaluation we have completed the melee portion of our class balancing. To be clear, these changes apply just to the combat aspect of melee classes. <br><br>Here are the results of our melee combat balancing, and the solutions we are including in this patch.<br><br><b>-Two-Handed Weapons-</b><br><br>We are making changes to two-handed weapons to increase their damage output and desirability. As many of you know, two-handed weapons are not doing comparable damage to dual wielded single-handed weapons. This problem really manifests itself in the high end game. Before level 50, two-handed weapons perform fairly well. The following two-handed weapon change applies to characters level 51 and higher-<br><br>Two-handed weapons currently receive a damage bonus based on the delay of the weapon. Slower weapons swing less often, but hit harder when they connect. We have increased this damage bonus significantly over what it used to be. This increase in the damage bonus improves the damage potential of all existing two-handed weapons. Up through epic level weapons, the damage bonus alone makes two-handers a very viable choice for melee classes.<br><br>Along with the damage bonus enhancement, certain post-epic quality two-handers are being upgraded. The quality of these weapons did not improve enough when compared to the difficulty of encounters, and the rate at which one-handed weapons improved. These retroactive two-handed weapon upgrades are included in this patch. <br><br>To help you in selecting which two-handed weapons you want to use, we are giving a new piece of information when you inspect a two-handed weapon - the Damage Bonus. This damage bonus is the number of extra damage points that are added to each hit, based on the weapon delay. <br><br>*Please note- when combined with the damage bonus change, only the very highest quality weapons needed a stat improvement as well.<br><br>SPECIFIC CLASS CHANGES-<br><br><b>-Warriors-</b><br><br>The warrior is the key figure in any discussion of melee class balance. As the obvious choice for the "standard" melee class, we evaluated the warrior first to see how he compared to where we wanted him to be. Overall, we are quite happy with how the warrior performs in battle. At the very high end of the game, a warrior's damage output exceeds what we wanted, but not by so much that it merits any change. The "Defensive" discipline is also somewhat overpowered, but many high-end encounters now factor in this discipline in their design so this also remains unchanged. <br><br>As a class, the warrior is useful in both group and raid situations, and in fact is often thought of as crucial to making an efficient group. With these factors in mind, our decision is to leave the warrior class as is, both offensively and defensively. Warriors are well balanced and fill their role admirably.<br><br>That being said, we did make one enhancement to the warrior class. With the increase in damage output of several other classes, we are raising the Taunt skill cap for warriors. This increase begins at level 51, and the warrior gains a few points each level until 60th, when it caps at 230 skill. Taunt still follows all the previous rules with regard to taunting things above your level.<br><br>Also included in this patch, the Blade of Strategy and the Blade of Tactics may be used in either hand.<br><br><br><b>-Rogues-</b><br><br>The rogue class is also key to melee balance, because they clearly define the maximum amount of melee damage we want done in EverQuest. The rogue currently is, and will remain the king of situational melee damage. If a rogue has the opportunity to backstab, no other melee class approaches his damage output. This remains unchanged.<br><br>When we looked at the damage potential for rogues, we took into account that even in the best groups, a rogue can't backstab 100% of the time. In a well played experience group, a rogue is able to attempt backstabs roughly 90% of the time. In a more chaotic raid situation, it is harder to get backstabs more than 75% of the time due to monsters changing agro targets, moving around, or having their backs against a wall. So, when evaluating the rogue, we assumed 90% backstabs in a single group situation, and 75% backstabs on a raid level encounter.<br><br>Taking this all into account, the rogue met or exceeded our expectations in damage potential and his skills and damage output will not be receiving any adjustments, positive or negative. <br><br>However, we did discover that rogues do not have a full selection of piercing weapons available at all levels between 51 and 60. Prior to attaining an epic weapon, rogues do less damage than we expected. Additionally, rogues do not receive equal weapon upgrades post-epic when compared to other melee classes. To remedy this situation, we are adding new piercing weapons to give rogues a reasonable progression from 51-60. A few existing high-end daggers are being upgraded to make them relatively equal in quality to the weapons other classes have available. These new and upgraded weapons will begin appearing in the game in the near future.<br><br><br><b>-Monks-</b><br><br>While monks are an excellent class with some very useful abilities, our evaluation of monks found that they were coming up short in regards to damage output. In the progression from level 50 to level 60, monks slowly slip from doing the most toe-to-toe melee damage by a wide margin, to being very slightly better than a warrior in the high-end game. <br><br>Our goal for monks is to have them do significantly more damage than a similarly equipped warrior, without encroaching on the territory of rogues. We selected improvements for the monk class that place their damage output just below the midpoint of a warrior and a rogue. This is a sufficient damage advantage over a warrior to make a monk desirable in groups and raids, while leaving a large margin between the monk and the backstabbing rogue.<br><br>To accomplish this damage improvement, the first thing we did was move monks to new damage tables at levels 55 and 60. This means a monk will do slightly more damage than other classes when using the same weapons. This change is moderate at level 55, and a bit more noticeable at 60th. <br><br>In addition to new damage tables, we also gave the ability to Triple Attack to monks at level 60. This ability allows the monk to possibly attack a third time with his main hand, after each successful double attack. The final change to monks is the institution of minimum damage on Flying Kick beginning at level 51 and scaling up through level 60. <br><br>Also, much like the rogue, we discovered that monks do not receive a reasonable weapon selection between levels 51 and 60. We plan to add new blunt weapons for monks in the future to round out the monk class.<br><br><br><b>-Rangers-</b><br><br>Rangers were the most complex class we looked at during this evaluation. Rangers were clearly lacking in their ability to tank, and also proved to be doing slightly less damage than was desirable. After evaluating several possible solutions, we made upgrades in both of these areas. Keep in mind, rangers are an offense-oriented hybrid, giving up the ability to tank well in exchange for doing similar damage to a warrior. <br><br>In order to put rangers in the right place offensively, we made two changes. First, we upgraded their Double Attack skill cap from 235 to 245. Additionally, we gave rangers an innate offensive bonus beginning at level 55, and increasing until level 60. This has the net effect of allowing them to double attack a bit more often, and hit harder on successful attacks. These two changes put the ranger exactly where we want him, doing approximately the same damage as a similarly equipped warrior.<br><br>Part of the balancing factor of the ranger is the inability to tank well. This penalty will remain, though we are making some changes to lessen it. Prior to this patch, rangers were taking more damage than we desired. After these changes take effect, rangers will tank better than they did, but not nearly as well as the knight, bard, and warrior classes. <br><br>We are raising the Defense skill cap for rangers. This increase begins at level 51, increasing a few points each level until it caps at 220. We are also raising the ranger&#8217;s Riposte skill cap to 185 starting at level 51 and scaling up to level 60.<br><br><br><b>-Paladins and Shadowknights-</b><br><br>The Knight classes receive some of the biggest benefits from this melee balancing. Our evaluation of knights showed that in many cases they were doing just over half the damage of a similarly equipped warrior. This is simply not enough damage to make them highly desirable in group and raid situations. The changes we are implementing put knights at a bit over three-quarters of the damage potential of a ranger or a warrior. This represents a significant upgrade from their current status, without threatening the desirability of the ranger or warrior classes.<br><br>The first thing we did was to move knights to the same damage tables as warriors. This damage table is now shared by all melee classes, except the monk who is on the higher tables described above. By placing knights on this table, they will now hit harder with the same weapons than they did previously.<br><br>The second change that greatly benefits knight classes is the upgrade to two-handed weapons. While this isn't a knight only upgrade, as the premier users of two-handed weapons it has a profound effect on their damage potential. The two-handed weapon upgrade is discussed in more detail in the previous section.<br><br>For knights that prefer to use a weapon and shield combo, we plan to go through existing weapons available in the game and upgrade them in cases where they are not doing enough damage. These upgrades, as well as any new weapons we may add, will begin to be seen in game in the near future. One thing to note- a knight using a two-handed weapon will do more damage than a knight with weapon and shield of similar quality.<br><br>The final change we are making to knights is the increase of their Taunt skill cap. This increase begins at level 51, increasing a few points each level until it caps at 220 skill. Taunt still follows all the previous rules with regard to taunting things above your level.<br><br><br><b>-Bards-</b><br><br>Like rangers, bards are receiving enhanced offensive and defensive abilities. Bards are intended to do the least melee damage of our melee classes, falling somewhat behind Paladins and Shadowknights, but doing more than half the damage of a similarly equipped warrior. We found in some situations, this was not the case and bards were doing too little damage. <br><br>We are raising bard weapon skills (1h blunt, 1h slash) to a new cap of 250 skill. Piercing skill is being raised to 240. We are also increasing their Offense skill cap to 252 between levels 51 and 60. Along with the skill cap increases, we are moving the bard to the same melee damage table as the warrior and other classes. While this is a meaningful increase in bard damage potential, without the Double Attack skill bards continue to do less damage than a knight, as intended.<br><br>Defensively, we have raised the bard Parry cap to 185 points between levels 51 and 60. <br><br>Also this patch, the Singing Shortsword is now able to be equipped in the off hand, and gives it's full song enhancing benefits when used in either hand. This allows bards a bit more choice in weapon selection.<br><br><b>---MAGIC SYSTEM CHANGES---</b><br><br>In addition to the melee changes mentioned above, we&#8217;ve also made some wide-ranging changes to the way the spell system works, or more accurately, the spell-resist system and how it works in regards to content, specifically content of a high level.<br><br>Through our testing we found that many higher level creatures, and especially those creatures that are above 60th level, were typically resisting magical damage to an extent far greater than they should have been. This lead to a couple of classes having their usefulness in these situations either negated or reduced to a pure utility role. As such we&#8217;ve made the following changes:<br><br>NPCs now have less of a chance to resist any direct damage spell caused by casters above level 50. Super-high level NPCs have received a large reduction in the level-difference bonus they receive to their resists based upon the level of the attacking player character. We&#8217;ve increased the effectiveness of resist debuffs against a large number of higher level NPCs in regard to damage spells being cast upon them. We&#8217;ve also reduced the resistances on a wide range of NPCs, especially for NPCs in Velious. Finally, we&#8217;ve given our designers more control over the ability to customize any particular encounter. For example previously, if a designer didn&#8217;t want a creature to be mesmerisable, he had to give it high magic resistance. Now they can set that feature individually while keeping magic resists reasonable so they don&#8217;t take a bunch of classes out of the picture through the need for one feature.<br><br>Players will now also receive messages when an NPC is immune to a particular type of spell, much like messages regarding mesmerization have always been sent. We can do this since the designers have direct control over the effectiveness of certain utility effects, while still allowing damage-causing spells to go through. As an example, NPCs that were always immune to melee-speed debuffs by virtue of the fact that they had a very high magic resistance will still be immune to those spells, but magic-based spells that cause damage or do some other effect that the designer didn&#8217;t necessarily want to rule out would now go through.<br><br>Finally, to compensate for increased magical damage, some NPCs have received additional abilities and/or stats. This serves to keep the encounters at a similar level of difficulty while balancing the contribution of melee and casters, rather than engaging exclusively in the melee-heavy strategy of before.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Alan talked about <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000338.html">rewards for FV testers</a> in a recent update to the Developer's Corner.  Check it out:<UL><b>Just a heads up guys, if you decide to throw a bone (give a gift) to people testing a server, and bump them up in level as a 'bonus' for having tested for you, please remember to also give them some cash for buying appropriate level spells/songs at the very least.. if not a few pieces of bronze armor or something as well. <br><br>I was playing a bard on FV, and having an absolute blast.. I will definitely be starting a new character monday.. however when I logged in to find him level 24, but absolutely naked and with about 3 gold pieces to his name, I gave up. It would have taken a week to get a group together and hack our way through lower level stuff to the point where we could gain a few pieces of armor, maybe a weapon or two, and *maybe* buy one appropriate level song/spell.<br><br>I appreciate the chance to test and I did have a good time, but please think about the actual results when you 'give a gift' to folks who are testing for you..:)  My testing ended that day, now I'm waiting for the server to be wiped so I can start anew..<br><br>Zandramas</b><br><br>A few people have said something like this. I find it rather odd, really.<br><br>If you were able to buy your eighth level spells when you were only eighth level using fourth level spells, you can most certainly attain your eighth level spells as a 24th level character using 4th level spells. Certainly your ability to earn cash has only increased with the level boost. With very little effort a caster should be able to get the spell power he needs by only purchasing the minimal spells as stepping stones for making more money to get the next stepping stone spells. I would think that it would only take a few hours of play to bootstrap your way into your 24th level spells.<br><br>While this process would take longer for a warrior, it can be done the same way. You can be a fully equip and fully effective 24th level character in a very short time, especially when compared with the time it would take to level your character that high.<br><br>The point of the level increase was to allow characters a burst of advancement so they could test some of the higher level areas. It also, and most specifically, allows you to test how the no-drop/trivial loot code thing works.<br><br>We very much appreciate your testing this server. However it is very important that when playing on that server you need to be aware of the purpose of the server, testing. I would urge you to go back and try it out. You will find that it does not take a week to equip your character, and that with a group whose goals are exclusively geared toward gaining some sort of minimal equipment and cash for each other, it can be done with relative ease. We do really want to see how the code effects people that lose all their stuff, as this was one of the greatest concerns voiced by our players about the trivial loot code.<br><br>Alan</UL>

This <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000336.html">message</a> was found on the Developer's Corner concerning the EverQuest Patch Server:<UL>quote:<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The problem we experienced with the patch servers this weekend had nothing whatsoever to do with anyone being banned. An old patch server was inadvertently brought back up and caused some annoyances for a little while. People couldn't actually play the game with the bad files. We check for file integrity in a number of places, none of which have anything to do with what we are doing server side when checking for hackers. It was only 1 of a number of patch servers we have up, so only a small percentage of people even had this happen to them, and it was corrected later the day it was reported. <br><br>John Smedley<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>We're sorry about the problems the patch servers were causing. As Mr. Smedley said (though not using these words&#8230;  ) the goofy things the patchers were doing is not related in any way to the methods we use to catch hackers.<br><br>The old patch server was causing people re-download files and making accessing the game somewhat difficult. Again, we're sorry for the problem.<br><br>Alan</UL>

Catch the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000334.html">latest comments</a> from Alan VanCouvering regarding the topic of EverQuest Game Cards in the following excerpts:<UL><b>just wondering why exactly the game cards for playing without a credit card are only available at US retailers?Seems kind of silly to only have them available in the US when the player base is spread all over and the cards themselves don't care where they are sold.Seems to me they would be exactly like selling the game itself.So why exactly was the decision to only sell them in the US made?<br><br>Tsorath Ravenspirit</b><br><br><br>You can also purchase them directly from us at out online store. Try this link (hopefully I get this one right).<br><br><a href="https://store.station.sony.com/hardgood.jsp?SKU=EQ1RE-SU-GC1001-EQGCRD-90DAY">https://store.station.sony.com/hardgood.jsp?SKU=EQ1RE-SU-GC1001-EQGCRD-90DAY</a><br><br>Alan</UL>Alan returned to this issue shortly after making his first post:<UL>Wolfran wrote:<br><br><b>So you're saying I can use my credit card to purchase a Game Card that will allow me to play Everquest without needing a credit card. Sign me up! </b><br><br>I recognize the irony in all that. I'm a big fan of irony&#8230;<br><br>The cards are basically a solution for purchase in stores, where you can use any sort of payment the store will accept. But for those of you that can't find them in stores, it might be a lot easier to have someone buy you a Game Card as a one time purchase (think Christmas!) than to have them pay for an ongoing expense like a subscription to EverQuest.<br><br>Alan</UL>
