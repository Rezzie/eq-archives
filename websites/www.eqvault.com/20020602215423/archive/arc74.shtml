Gordon talked about NPCs fleeing in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018596.html">following thread he started on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>Last week while optimizing code, one of the programmers fixed a variable initilization problem that resulted in the fixing of a bug that had been around a long time in regards to when NPCs decide to flee. As a result of this, NPCs became much more likely to flee in combat. The response to this has been mixed, with roughly an equal number of people on both sides of the issue.<br><br>Now that the problem was fixed, we've reevaluated the the bravery code and determined that they flee too often now. As such, that potential to flee will be reduced in tomorrow's patch, though they will still flee more than they did before.<br><br>That said, the same change also had a decidedly negative effect: Charmed creatures began fleeing. I think everyone can agree that this part of it was pretty well objectionable, so we're going to stop charmed creatures from fleeing.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Yakatizma made a couple of posts recently on the Coalition of Tradesfolks Board.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/001033.html">post #1 on Bards and imbue issue</a>:<UL>I don't play on test, so I don't know if this is in or not yet, but will bards receive an imbue spell for Veeshan?

Yes I am aware that Regeneration was added to the Phantom line even prior to RoK, but why?, is my question.]</i></font> <br><br>We wanted the Phantom armor series to be useful to the mages. We didn't want to resort to increasing AC as in order to make it useful in that regard, the AC value would have had to be more than those of other classes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018208.html"><b>Closing Threads</b></a><br>I'm sorry cthon, but we need to encourage new ideas here on the board rather than revisiting the old ones over and over like a skipping record. We have these boards because they are a benefit to us. They can only be a benefit to us if they are a benefit to the players, which is the same thing. These boards cannot be a benefit to the players if we're constantly stuck in neutral. The point that they cease to benefit the players they cease to benefit us and they will be closed down. Let's see that that doesn't happen.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018184.html"><b>Starting Out on New Server</b></a><br>You must be quite the adventurer Azrael! <br><br>Though I wish you well on your journey, I might remind you that it will be some time before anyone will be capable of binding you. Though I think that it's possible for you to make the entire trip once, a few newbie deaths before anyone can bind could make things difficult.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018180.html"><b>Abashi Biased?</b></a><br>I knew this would come up. I almost put a disclaimer at the bottom explaining that more classes than the necro have fear spells, and that the suggested problem is pretty black and white making it a simple test, but I thought better of it. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018183.html"><b>Necros</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why isn't this game called "letsseehowlongittakestogeteveryonetostartanecroQuest" ]</i></font><br><br>Because in order to get all of that on the front of the box, the font would have to be so small that no one could read it. <br><br>Seriously though, yes, necros are powerful in their way. So are enchanters, and clerics, and warriors, and rogues, and a bunch of other classes. They are all "powerful" in their own way. <br><br>I'd agree that necros were too powerful if they were displacing other classes in their own bailiwick, which isn't happening.</UL>

Looks like a new message went up on the Patch Server yesterday.  Here it is for those that missed it:<UL>*Level 1 Character Purge*<br><br>The Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take place on Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7).  Any level 1 characters that haven't been played within the previous 30 days will be deleted.  If you wish to keep any level 1 characters that you may have, please log in and play them between now and 9/27.  <br><br><br>September 25th, 6:00pm<br>------------------------------<br><br>*New Servers*<br><br>We're pleased to announce that we are bringing up two new servers in the near future. <br><br>Tholuxe Paells will be a server for new characters only (no moves) and will be brought up following the patch this Wednesday.  Drinal will be a split server, initially accepting characters from Mithaniel Marr and Tunare.  We may open /movelog registrations for other servers in the future as system-load allows.<br><br>Registration for the move (via "/movelog yes") will take place on Friday, September 29th between 6PM PDT (GMT-7) and 12AM. You must be in game and run the command if you wish to be moved.  As a reminder, no special arrangements are made to keep guilds or groups together in the transition. If too many people execute the command to take them all, it is possible that some might get left behind. Also, any corpses left in the world at the time the actual split takes place will not follow you to the new server. The time of the split will be publicized on the "Scheduled Downtime" page at www.everquest.com.<br><br>One final note: There is a potential problem with the /movelog command when issued by hundreds of people at one time.  We highly recommend that you wait at least 15 minutes after registration opens prior to using the command. If you have any concerns that your command may not have gone through, you can zone and repeat the command if you wish.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

More posts were created during the last few hours by Gordon on the Gameplay Board.

You might consider searching some archives on news sites for this happening. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What I don't get and this is the point of the post is this: Verant will go days, weeks, months and deny there are no problems, then change things and say it wasn't do to player request. ]</i></font><br><br>Again, I'm not sure where you came up with this. While we have been guilty of allowing issues to continue for a period of time while we were of the belief that everything was fine, in every case I can think of that we later changed our minds, we stated that it was due to input here on the boards.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018117.html"><b>Closed Threads</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No offense Gordon, but every single post you replied to today (tues) ended that the subject is closed]</i></font> <br><br>Why is it that people keep using terms like "every" when it's clear that it isn't the case? Do a search. Perhaps every post that you looked at might have said that, but *every* post most certainly did not. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How about just ignoring the posts if you have already decided you're going to respond negative to every single thing?]</i></font> <br><br>Because then I get bogged down answering posts asking why I'm ignoring a particular issue :)<br><br>I guess I just need to spend more time on page 10 where the posts I'd like to see on the first page end up. It's a bit depressing to work late into the night with something that I care deeply about only to be constantly bombarded with "you don't care" posts. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018081.html"><b>Proxy Servers and EQ</b></a><br>There are some other proxy options out there, including connection sharing built into Windows, however if you'd rather use this one, I imagine that it's a port problem. Be sure that you have the proxy set up to allow UDP above 1024. <br><br>One of the most reliable ways to set up proxies/firewalls is to open them wide up to be sure that they work, then start locking them down to what you actually need and is secure. Give it a shot. <br><br>Just to check, you can browse the web with the second system, yes?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018122.html"><b>Past Issues</b></a><br>Several news sites are maintaining archives of past posts going back nearly a year.

I have no doubt that some are harder than others, as that wasn't what we were going for. We were going for making good quests for each class regardless of difficulty.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017877.html"><b>Aradune is Stinky!</b></a><br>I hear that the Irontoes had something to do with it :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017870.html"><b>Unexpected Flee Change</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Both Fear and Terror have been breaking unusually fast, I did a couple tests the other night on Jyle Windshot in WFP with Fear, out of 20 that landed unresisted only 5 or so lasted longer than half a second, I would cast and see XXX looks affraid, then see imediatly after your fear spell has worn off.]</i></font> <br><br>That's an interesting observation.

Here are the posts Gordon Wrinn wrote this afternoon on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018034.html"><b>Mark of Karn - What went wrong?</b></a><br>Before I close the thread, I'd hardly say that the issue regarding Mark of Karn qualified as a "fiasco". It was an overpowered spell that we addressed. End of story. <br><br>Yes, it should have been balance-tested (different from bug testing) under more diverse circumstances, but it wasn't, and we apologize for that. That being the case, it didn't become evident until more than a few clerics picked up the spell that it was a problem. <br><br>And just a note, the balance problems with this spell was brought up more by clerics than other classes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018031.html"><b>Mark of Karn Post</b></a><br>There's no "politics". The spell was too powerful in its original configuration. Given that, the change to its current state was made. At that point we put together another option that we felt would balance the spell and return it to usefulness again. The players here on the board accepted that option as better than its current state.

Gordon hit the boads again late last night and posted the following responses to many different player-genated posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017817.html"><b>Disciplines for Hybrids</b></a><br>We've been looking into the idea of possible disciplines for hybrids, but for more of a flavor thing than a balance one. If the suggestion being made is that there is a balance issue that can be solved by discipline, I'd have to disagree. Based upon the series of tests that were just made, they are now all measuring up as they should.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017819.html"><b>Is that really Brad and Gordon?</b></a><br><a href="http://www.gucomics.com/archives/default.asp?date=09/26/2000">http://www.gucomics.com/archives/default.asp?date=09/26/2000</a><br><br>Heh, yeah, those aren't too bad :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017816.html"><b>Quests</b></a><br>We're working on quests for Iksar to fill the mid-level gap, but I believe I mentioned before that it's not something that I'd be prepared to give periodic updates on. There are far too many issues that are brought up on this board with some regularity that getting involved in "status reports" wouldn't really help. <br><br>That said, the status at this point hasn't changed. The items have been created and the quests are being designed. We decided to hold off on them until after the epic quests went in. When the quests are put in, we may or may not announce something about it in the patch. We don't want to set a precident of announcing the existance of quests when they go in. We made an exception in the case of the epic quests due to the previous talk concerning the fiery avenger.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017809.html"><b>The Team and Mark of Karn</b></a><br>The team works together on these issues, and many others. There's no one person "in charge" of the change to Mark of Karn. <br><br>That said, many of the people on this team read this board on a daily basis, so you can be sure that your issues are heard. I do wish that it was easier to illustrate the amount of contact you have with various members of the development team as it's pretty amazing. It is not at all an unusual occurance that by the time I post a "we'll look into it" message, the people with their hands in the issue have already looked at it and are ready for me :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017733.html"><b>Mark of Karn</b></a><br>We had the discussion last week, presented two options here on the boards, and the players chose one of them. It will be implemented in the patch on Wednesday. I don't have the thread handy, but you should be able to search for it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017772.html"><b>Account Transfers</b></a><br>To answer question, account transfers are not permitted per the EULA for any reason, whether or not any "profit" was gained by either party through the process.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017783.html"><b>Humans Should Drap Raw Meat!</b></a><br>I hear that there's a chef somewhere who can help you out with this. I hear that much of this stuff isn't palatable raw, but works out pretty well once cooked up :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017720.html"><b>Deity Issues</b></a><br>When someone starts their character, they are making choices for how that character has lived their life. The choices of race, class, starting stats, and deity are not mutable for this reason. Since it was decided that they would not be mutable, no method to allow them to be mutable was included within the game. <br><br>Concerning the debate that people didn't know that at some future date the choice of religion would carry more weight, the game is constantly changing. No one starting a character can be aware of everything regarding the game nor future directions that the game may take. Someone brand new to the game may have no idea what the impact of choices such as race, class, starting stats, or religion will be. Essentially, this is part of the game. <br><br>It may make sense in the real world for an agnostic to "see the light" and choose to follow a deity, however for the purposes of gameplay limitations on reality are necessary. <br><br>I've addressed this topic many times since it was announced that deity-specific items would be coming in game, and our stance on this issue has to be firm. Changing of religion and "agnostic-only" equipment are not something that we are considering implementing.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017691.html"><b>Girl Gamers</b></a><br>Just a note here, while I think that the original author's post (which incidently doesn't really have anything to do with EQ, but rather the RPG industry in general) makes some good points for people in our industry, I really don't think that it supports the title written by the person who reposted it. <br><br>We're very proud of our gender demographics which to our knowledge support a better ratio than other RPG products. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017699.html"><b>Get Pizza in EverQuest!</b></a><br>I'm sorry, but putting pizza in game would affect racial-interdepency. The ogres and trolls would start eating it...then what use would they have for gnomes?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017684.html"><b>The Deal</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: For what it's worth, thankyou Gordon, Brad et al for the past year of fun. I'll keep paying you $10 a month if you keep up the challenge. Deal?]</i></font> <br><br>Deal :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015226.html"><b>The Business Side of Things</b></a><br>To expand upon your assertions, yes, we're a business, and businesses are around to make money. Of course the money comes from the customers. If we don't make something that the customers want, we don't make any money. <br><br>But thank God for businesses, for if it weren't for them, we wouldn't be able to enjoy many of the things that we have today. Sometimes it takes a business to bring an idea that could stand very well on its own into fruition. Does the artist who makes their living at it care any less about their canvas? Does the musician care any less about their music because they make money from it? Wouldn't everyone prefer to be able to make a living doing what they love? Does everyone get that chance? Wouldn't the world be better if they did? <br><br>The core design team of EverQuest was a bunch of guys who played MUDs and other RPG games together and had ideas for the game that they always wanted to play. What a boon that it is also the game that everyone else wants to play as well. This game would never have come about were there not a potential to make money, and the money from this game will fund the creation of other games by other teams who are making the game that *they* always wanted to play. <br><br>Making money, and creating something that you care deeply about are not mutually exclusive concepts. In fact, sometimes the former is absolutely necessary to bring about the latter.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017560.html"><b>Charm Stealth  Nerf</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Charmed mobs now flee when low health...even if they are WINNING THE FIGHT.]</i></font> <br><br>This is just part of the AI fix that went in as part of the last patch. Previously, NPCs were far more 'brave' than they should have been, and the patch addressed this issue. There was no special code in to keep charmed pets from fleeing, they just never did due to bravery being artificially high. Summoned pets do not however flee, which is part of design. <br><br>That said, we're going to adjust how bravery is calculated due to the inclusion of last weeks patch. After the one this week they should not flee as much.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016941.html"><b>Shaman Pet</b></a><br>As I've posted before on this subject, the additional mana cost of the pet is intended. As much as I wish I could get everyone's buy-in on the subject, it was established the last time the issue came up that it wouldn't be possible. I'm sorry that there are disagreements in this matter, but this isn't something we're considering changing in the foreseeable future.</UL>

Lady Dae elaborated a bit on the difference between events and quests.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000004.html">the post</a>:<UL><i>There seems to be a misunderstanding between Events and Quests.<br><br>Events change Character (Player) and Server history, Quests change Norrath's history.<br><br>Events are run with GM's and Guides being GM's and Guides, Quests are run with GM-NPC's that can be anything from Gnolls to Dragons.<br><br>GM's that are involved in a quest usually are designed to be slain by players. GM's that are involved with an Event are never designed to be slain.<br><br>The only difficult point is the creation of true NPC's which both can do to make the Event or Quest better.<br><br>99 percent of Events take place in the Arena. I have never seen a Quest run in the Arena.<br><br>Events are almost always pre-announced, with rules, times, and dates. Quests are almost never pre-announced, and usually have very limited rules for players.<br><br>Hopefully this will clear up the misunderstandings between what the "Event Staff" and "Quest Team" are.<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Events Coordinator<br>Verant Interactive</i></UL>Here's a follow-up by Tunso:<UL><i>One clarification to this statement:<br><br>========<br><br>GM's that are involved in a quest usually are designed to be slain by players. GM's that are involved with an Event are never designed to be slain.<br><br>=======<br><br>Though in most cases the actors in a Quest "can" be attacked, meaning that it is physically possible to attack them, it does not mean that they are always "designed" to be attacked and slain. In most cases, unless an NPC being portrayed by an actor says that it's going to attack you or you see the NPC attacking others, you actually may want to try having a conversation with them first. Trying to kill the NPC may not be the best idea and you may wind up missing out or ruining your chance to participate in something unique and fun :)</i></UL>

Shadoe, in his own unique and original way, addresses the recent dispute over the MMORPG volunteers, making special note of the lawsuit in the UO community.

Here's a clip from this article:<UL><i>Furthermore, I must protest to the semi-automatic weapon that is consistently held to my head as I perform such duties for you. Had I a choice in the matter, I would never have continued slaving away as your personal editorial writer for no money, sustenance or compensation of any kind. I don't even get a free account with which to play the game, so I can comment (somewhat) intelligently on the topic of EverQuest. Funding for such research comes from my own hard-earned money, and I'll not stand for it any longer.</I></UL>Thanks Shadoe, interesting and though provoking as usual, and I'm working on that pony! :)

Hot off the pages of the Gameplay Board comes the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017656.html">following announcement</a> made by Gordon Wrinn:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>The new servers that we had on order are now here and ready to go live. We've decided to make one a "new" server (for new characters only), and use the second one as a split-server.<br><br>The "new" server, Tholuxe Paells, will go live following the patch this Wednesday. <br><br>Concerning the split, based on peak usage, MithMarr and Tunare will be split. /movelogs ("/movelog yes") will be taken Friday night between 8pm and 10pm PDT (GMT-7), with the server split server, Drinal, going up early next week. Additional splits to this server might be done in the future if system load permits.<br><br>One item of note: The /movelog command has a problem when hundreds of people try to execute the command at once. I highly recommend that you wait at least 15 minutes after registration opens prior to using the command. If you have any concerns that your command may not have gone through, you can zone and repeat the command if you wish.<br><br>As a reminder, no special arrangements are made to keep guilds or groups together in the transition. If too many people execute the command to take them all, it is possible that some might get left behind. Also, any corpses left in the world at the time the actual split takes place will not follow you to the new server. The time of the split will be publicized on the "Scheduled Downtime" page at www.everquest.com.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Here's today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017675.html"><b>Closing Threads</b></a><br>I posted some time ago that threads explicitly or implicitly addressed to us, discussing dead issues, would be closed. Melee binding is one of those dead issues, and the thread was me or us collectively.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017680.html"><b>"Get Out While You Can"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: if you have just bought this game have fun while you can because its a majior drag at the higher levels....i played this game for close to 8 months and when i finally did walk away from it the whoel experiance left a sour taste in my mouth.... ]</i></font><br><br>I'm personally happy that we kept you entertained for 8 months. That's a surprising thing for a video game. Sure, there are other people who have been playing for a year and a half who still love the game, and that's great as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: levels 1-30 are fun but after that you can forget about it ]</i></font><br><br>You might consider starting another class and playing levels 1-30 again since you found them fun. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: thay have made the game so incredablly hard after that level that you will have an terable time playing... ]</i></font><br><br>Increased difficulty with advancement is part of games of this nature. Though the upper levels may not have been suited to you, they are the things that keep everyone else still playing after 8 months. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: ...that is unless you enjoy sitting in one place just to stand up every 10 mins to engage in a one min fight.... ]</i></font><br><br>That 10 minutes of downtime indicates you are a caster who goes full burn for every fight, is camping, and probably solo. You might try grouping or moving around a little for some more excitement. Some classes can increase the speed at which you regen mana, and all classes can reduce downtime by virtue of spreading the downtime across two or more people.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017694.html"><b>2Hand Weapon Bonuses Bad?</b></a><br>I've seen a couple of posts along these lines, however we checked the code and ran some tests and everything appears to be working fine. Look at your minimum damage with these weapons (40+ delay). It should be better than it was before. It's not by a lot, but it's still an extra few points of damage per hit.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017658.html"><b>Is raiding a town permissable?</b></a><br>It's perfectly permissable. Enjoy :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017653.html"><b>Cultural Armor for Erudites</b></a><br>Erudites typically haven't been known for their physical prowess. It makes sense that some of the cultural stuff coming out fit into what certain races are or are not very good at.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017620.html"><b>Some Opinions Are Out</b></a><br>Closed issue. Sorry. This is not something that will be a part of EverQuest. We have to place limits on what we will or will not implement in game, and this is beyond one of those limits.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017596.html"><b>Religous Restrictions Unfair</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Unless you are prepared to open up the doors to all religions at character creation, you should not punish someone for not choosing a god.]</i></font> <br><br>No one is being "punished" for not choosing a god. They are just not receiving the benefits *of* choosing a god. Now if we took items that were previously usable by everyone and restricted them by deity, that could be construed as what you suggest.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017611.html"><b>Runed Fighters Staff</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I know you removed warriors ability to wield this weapon because they did too much damage with it. But since the latest patch it does as much damage as 2 jade maces]</i></font> <br><br>That weapon had a ratio of nearly 1. I doubt that it does anywhere near the damage of the Jade Maces. That said, we'll probably have to scale the damage bonus to 1H weapons in the same fashion as that done for 2H weapons. We'll see if that's the case.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017415.html"><b>Official Forums Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Not only was it not shut down, but it was carefully pruned to leave the "good" and take out (most) of the offensive. (you missed one or two).<br>When did you get the ability to do this?]</i></font> <br><br>All or most of the "offensive" posts in this thread were made by one person, giving us the ability to do a "prune by user". <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why was it applied to this post (which I applaud) but not to others that were simply removed? Sure, some threads get so bad that they just should be removed, but some can be salvaged. ]</i></font><br><br>The "prune by user" function takes about 4 hours due to the number of posts here on the board. It's really only applicable when there's one or two people making offending posts in a thread. As it is, if a thread degenerates to the point that a bunch of people are making posts of that nature, it's more prudent to get rid of the whole thread, as the chance for reasonable discussion is pretty well eaten up by flames and counter-flames. <br><br>Also, if the owner of a thread (the person who made it) comes back and makes offending posts, it will also result in the whole thread being deleted.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017374.html"><b>EQ Violating Users Privacy?</b></a><br>Windows applications (like the EQ client) use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) from the MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class) and other exentions such as DirectX. These APIs in turn access other APIs which access yet other APIs which result in Windows OS calls that produce the output you are seeing. <br><br>Our code is not accessing, analyzing, collecting, or returning any data outside of the files necessary to run EverQuest. <br><br>If there are any windows programmers out there, feel free to jump in :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017397.html"><b>AI Bug</b></a><br>Well I believe I called it an "unintended fix". The programmer was going through optimizing code, cleaning up any memory leaks that might have been around, and initializing variables that might not have been, and inadvertently fixed something that we didn't know wasn't working as intended. <br><br>That said, we're aware that there appears to be somewhat of a split between people who like the new AI and those who don't, so we're going to change it to roughly halfway between where it is now, and where it was, in the next patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017221.html"><b>Warriors and Taunt: Raising the Level</b></a><br>When we know, we'll release further information. It's still under investigation.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017253.html"><b>Damage and Delay</b></a><br>Actually only 2H weapons with a delay under 28 had their damage bonus reduced. Weapons 28 to 39 stayed the same, with those above 40 getting an increase. <br><br>As for your problem, this is the first I've heard of a problem along these lines. I'll ask the programmer to take a look tomorrow and see that everything is ok.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017286.html"><b>Resist Bug Makes Bards Un-needed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is a "fact" that "everyone knows" that resists roll over after 255... i.e. 256 resist = 1 resist.<br><br>a) is this true? if so would you disclose it? it's not really one of those things that needs to be "hidden" since its so anti-intuitive and obviousely a result of computer programming, not some mystical god.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually I checked into it and this hasn't happened since beta when the resist-boosting spells were first put in. At that time, resists exceeding 255 would "roll" the counter, making it start over back at 1. This was apparently the case for all of the stats at one time. <br><br>Now they just cap (hard) at 255. <br><br>And to answer your question, yes, we would disclose it, and fix it right away.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017209.html"><b>Haste Items Stackable</b></a><br>This would not be an appropriate change. With the diversity of haste items in the game, this suggestion would make haste spells useless at the higher levels.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017214.html"><b>Banned</b></a><br>The posts have been pruned, I apologize for their presense. <br><br>I'd also like to remind everyone that giving out account info, despite being prohibited by the EULA, often results in it being banned due to the actions of people logged on to the account. On 3 occassions in the past week, people banned for activities on this board later contacted us and said that it was some ex-friends, guildmates, or others "borrowing" the account. <br><br>While I'm on it, if someone contacts you via messageboards, the usenet, email, or instant messaging, and offers to "trade" accounts for a while just to see what your character class is like and let you try theirs, they intend to steal your account. <br><br>Also, if someone offers to buy some items off of you, says that they need the items on the current character, and offers to log in their "alternate" to give you the money, they intend to steal your stuff. <br><br>Not to mention, if someone throws up a webpage with some 3rd party utility that allows you to "cheat" in EverQuest without getting caught, it just might contain a backdoor virus to allow them to get your account name and password. There are reputable 3rd party programs out there that do not affect gameplay that are as such not illegal and are distributed by reputable sources such as mainstream news sites that might be safe, but we make no warranties of any type nor do we endorse those programs. Just be sure of your source. <br><br>Finally, if someone with a level 1 character has a name very much like someone in your guild, and asks you to help twink them up with items, the person is most likely not your friend from the guild and just wants free stuff. <br><br>That should about cover it :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013570.html"><b>Dark Elf Rogues</b></a><br>Race isn't the only factor in regards to faction. Though I'm sure that what you are suggesting carries some weight, it's not all-encompassing. <br><br>I'll buy that there are less dark-elf rogues, but we're ok with that. If people want to play dark elves due to the roleplay factor over everything else, that's a good thing. We never expected that the number of people playing a class would be spread evenly over all of the available races.</UL>

Lanys T'vyl has returned to Norrath.  Our first report is from Kathai:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night, Emissary D'Veiu of the Tier'Dal nation called forth<br>throughout Nektulos forest for the assistance of those loyal to The<br>Dead.  Her call was answered by many dark elves, who offered their<br>assistance in the bringing of Lanys T'Vyl to Neriak on order of Queen<br>Cristianos Thex.  No harm was to come to Lanys, on punishment of death.<br><br>Through a blood ritual performed with the assistance of a shadowknight<br>named Kaydan, Lanys was summoned and bound to Nektulos forest at the<br>wizard pyramid.  There Lanys was offered sanctuary one last time, before<br>the Teir'Dal armies of The Dead were brought to force against her<br>selfish plans.  It was revealed that there is now a New Chosen, a young<br>child named Valizrae D`Tora.  This child had been captured by Lanys,<br>with the intent of torturing and ritually sacrificing the child so as to<br>prevent her from stealing Lanys' position as the Chosen.  However, the<br>Emissary revealed to Lanys that the location of the child was already<br>known by The Dead, and armies were already set in place to strike<br>against Lanys and her followers.  Despite this, Lanys refused sanctuary<br>and set herself irrevocably on her destiny to war.<br><br>The prophet Ashteth T'Dral appeared during the bitter war of words,<br>speaking against Lanys' foolishness.  The hatred flowing in dialogue<br>between the two sent a chill into even the most hardened Teir'Dal<br>watching.  In the end, Lanys escaped the power of the binding and left. <br>The Emissary left to report to the Queen, leaving Ashteth to warn those<br>watching - a war is coming soon, and the full glory of the Teir'Dal<br>nation will soon follow.<br><br>/ooc What a great time for me to drop back to Nektulos with my new<br>rogue! =)  The event was largely storytelling and roleplaying, although<br>Kaydan (sorry, don't remember last name or guild) was awarded a Hooded<br>Black Cloak for his participation in the ritual.  Surprisingly few<br>people were out of character or trying to interrupt the proceedings, and<br>I had a great time!  I've attached a few shots of the event.<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/LanysSummoning1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/LanysSummoning2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/LanysSummoning3.jpg">Screenshot #3</a></UL>Kathai<br>hired assassin of Morudoth Nimgaur, of the Council of Arcana</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!<br><br>The <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid969830818,77764,"><b>second report</a></b> was written in true roleplaying fashion by Koori of the Bristlebane server.  Due to it's length I've decided to post it in our <a href="/lore/stories">Stories</a> section.  For even more info on this recent development check it out!  Here's an excerpt:<UL><I>"Through the shadowed planes, she has been called."<br><br>There was a loud burst of magic on top of the wizard portal and out of the<br>smoke stepped the daughter of Innoruuk himself, Lanys T`Vyl. Her blood red<br>armor seemed to glow with unearthly magic.<br><br>I listened as the Emissary demanded she turn herself over to the protection<br>of The Dead and The Queen. Lanys refused and seemed very upset to have been<br>summoned from where ever she had been. The two spoke for some time ... and<br>again I must confess I did not listen all to clearly.<br><br>They spoke of another taking Lanys's place as Innoruuk's chosen, a child by<br>the name of Valizrae D`Tora. Lanys laughed and said she had the child and<br>was going to torture and scar her before binding her to this realm and then<br>killing her .. as some sort of warning to the gods.<br><br>Sometimes I have to wonder about the people of my birth .. these Teir`Dal<br>... so hungry for power.</I></UL>Thank you Koori!

I received the following news from Aeeleb:<BLOCKQUOTE>On Saturday September 23rd and continuing into the 24th, brave adventurers<br>from numerous guilds of the light race teams on Tallon Zek - led by Darkoan<br>of the Vale - stepped into the Plane of Sky. Their goal was to reach and<br>clear the 3rd island, with the second island never being passed before by<br>any team on Tallon Zek.<br><br>After a quick recovery from a defeat on Azerack island, they continued on<br>past that island and setup for what was the hardest adventure many of them<br>had ever faced. Precision and skillful pulling on the 3rd island lead to a<br>near flawless defeat of this island, and keeping deaths in the single<br>digits.<br><br>Once the 4th island was reached Gunzo Vanderhain became the first person -<br>and for quite awhile longer, the only person, to wield the Fiery Avenger on<br>Tallon Zek.<br><br>Having accomplished many firsts for Tallon Zek, many of the adventurers went<br>on that night to do what we do best, kill inkies :)<br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/tzpast/poa-gorgolask.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/tzpast/poa-gorgolask.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/tzpast/fieryobtained2.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/tzpast/fieryobtained2.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/tzpast/fagroup.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/tzpast/fagroup.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/tzpast/wheee.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/tzpast/wheee.jpg</a><br><br>Aeeleb Treelover<br>Hierophant of The Aggressors</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
