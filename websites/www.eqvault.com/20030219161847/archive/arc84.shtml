Brad talked more about the loot issue in a recent response posted to the one and only Gameplay Board.

As most of you know, I'm a huge proponent of player driven economies, player run bazaars and market places, etc. <br><br>No-drop basically removes an item from the economy.<br>All that said, though, there are places and encounters in the game where the rewards are so special that we want only those who participated to wield/wear the rewards.<br><br>I'm not totally happy with that, but at this point it's the lesser of evils. This all, of course, relates to the twinking issue as well, which also has great arguments for and against.<br><br>-Brad</I></b></UL>

Brad McQuaid <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013808-4.html">posted an in-depth response</a> to the "Lum Vs. Abashi" thread on the Gameplay Board:<UL><I>Very interesting thread.<br><br>I've debated myself for some time as to what good these boards do... Changing the boards to active accounts only with poster accountability was and is an attempt to make them constructive and both a benefit to Verant and our customers.<br><br>So many positive game changes have occurred because of these boards. Also, because of the official posts here appearing on boards everywhere, I really think it's a fairly efficient way to get the word out on issues.<br><br>But, then, there's the negativity. The posts that we should replace people, or that we never listen, or that our PR and CS is horrible, all on a board that we've put up and maintain. The generalizations are ludicrous (were it all true, of course, then there wouldn't be a board, nor an internet relations manager, and you wouldn't see many, many changes that originated from our customers implemented), but it's there. Does it hurt the game? Does it hurt Verant?<br><br>I don't know. It's hard to measure.<br><br>We do know that the vast majority of players don't read the boards themselves. Significantly more read the headlines summarized elsewhere, but even all the people who read all the fan sites related to EQ don't total to that many relative to our subscription base. But then, most of the people who do post play the game a LOT, know it very well, and have excellent insight.<br><br>We also know that the game continues to sell extremely well, that relatively VERY few people are leaving. The interactions with people in game, the emails and other feedback we get, is generally very positive.<br><br>So, I don't know. I do know that if I felt they were doing more harm then good, I'd shut them down. But it's pretty hard to do an empirical analysis given how many variables are involved as well as many subjective aspects.<br><br>In my opinion, overall, Abashi does a good job. Sometimes he doesn't handle a situation optimally, and well, neither do I. We're human, after all. But his general policy has been to be blunt and to the point and to try NOT to spin things. It's confusing sometimes, reading the criticisms, because I see people claiming he's spinning issues, but then I see other complaints that he's not taking the side of the player and being 'positive'.<br><br>Which is best? Blunt, no B.S., tell it like it is, objective posting? Or I'm your friend, I'll represent your side to those developer guys and seem all disappointed if they don't agree with you?<br><br>If you prefer the latter, then your dissatisfaction is probably my fault, because I prefer the former and I'm the guy who worked with Abashi in terms of how and what we wanted posted early on. I don't care for politicians, and people who pretend, and people who spin things because I guess I generally see through it. <br><br>Anyway, we'll continue to listen. We'll continue to post and to communicate. We'll continue to take good ideas and implement them if possible. And we'll continue to do our best to correct aspects of the game that could be improved.<br><br>I think, overall, that the game is better because of the boards despite the negativity and unrealistic expectations that continue to appear. The genre is relatively new, as are forums where developers are so accessible. And, as I've posted before, there aren't many MMORPGs so there's less choice. While I disagree with the assertions that we have a monopoly, I do think that there will be less complaining in the future due to more choice as well as the fact that the player base as a whole will mature in the sense that they'll understand more what is doable and what makes a great game. <br><br>Until then, though, we have the responsibility to improve EQ while simultaneously keeping it true to what it is at its core. And we'll also keep the boards up and keep listening. But we WILL control the signal to noise ratio. If anything, we'll become more strict. Negative, pointless, flaming drives away players with constructive criticism (negative and positive) - of that I am certain. And yeah, it also makes the game and the game's community look bad.<br><br>So, in closing, I'd really recommend that those of you who are upset with aspects of the game and would like to see change to keep things constructive. If you don't, honestly, you become self-defeating, because were the board to degenerate into purely flames and insults we'd shut it down, eliminating a fantastic avenue for you to affect the very change you want. Really, you risk losing your account AND losing these forums, and, knowing that you're all paying customers who care deeply about the game, I really don't think you want either. <br><br>-Brad</I></UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon shared some information regarding account warnings and bannings in a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014247.html">recent announcement posted to the Gameplay Board</a>.  Here is post #1 in this thread:<br><UL><i>Hello all, <br><br>There have been a number of requests here on the boards asking what warnings, suspensions, and bannings mean when applied to player accounts based upon actions taken in game or on these boards. <br><br>Warning - A warning is issued when we can give the customer the "benefit of the doubt". It's the assumption that they may not know what they are doing is inappropriate. It's very possible that warnings could be issued for borderline cases, and it really has no affect upon the account by itself. However, a pattern of someone not knowing that what they are doing is inappropriate leads to us no longer being able to give them the benefit of the doubt. This can very well lead to suspension or banning. <br><br>Suspension - Suspensions are temporary in nature. They typically last 7-10 business days, and customers are not allowed to access the EverQuest servers or message boards (for posting) during this time. They are appropriate when there has been a pattern of inappropriate conduct as indicated by warnings, or when there isn't question that conduct was inappropriate. A suspension means that while we still want your business, we want you to know that your conduct isn't appropriate. <br><br>Suspensions are also the first step taken when account-ownership is contested by someone with a bona fide claim. <br><br>Banning - Banishment is permanent removal from the game, and possibly future products as well (to be decided at a future date). It means that though we appreciate your past patronage, it is not in our best interest to continue the business relationship. Bannings are appropriate when the intensity of a willful act causes us to reach this determination. Bannings are also appropriate when there is past problems such as warnings or suspension. <br><br>Bannings are also appropriate for things such as confirmed EULA violations, attempts to defraud a GM/CS Rep, or other such problems. <br><br>Warnings are typically not contestable beyond the person who issued it. At most, the Server GM, at their option, may consider the issue. <br><br>Those who have been suspended or banned can contact <a href="mailto:EQAccountStatus@verant.com">EQAccountStatus@verant.com</a>, which is an email address reserved solely for communication with those customers, and is serviced by dedicated staff. Normal emails from people who have not been suspended or banned will not receive a response from this email address, and should forward their issue to <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a>. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Here's post #2:<UL>If you get a certain number of warnings will that then give you a suspension? <br><br><b><i>Yes, based of course on a judgement call of the person making that decision. That judgement call is basically: "Are these issues honest mistakes?" and "Does this customer still deserve the benefit of the doubt?". Someone getting warned repeatedly for the same thing is not likely to get the benefit of the doubt for long. <br><br>It's also important to mention that warnings are not a prerequisite for suspension, nor is suspension a prerequisite for a banning. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's post #3:<UL>you will only loose the account that has the infractions against it.... <br><br><b><i>There are exceptions to this. For instance, a few months ago someone made a bomb threat, causing us to ban two accounts that were at the same address and on the same credit card.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></uL>Here's post #4:<UL>According to Abashi's definition of a warning, logic dictates that players are always made aware of when they are given a warning, since:<br>" It's the assumption that they may not know what they are doing is inappropriate." <br><br><b><I>Yes, but this is another issue that has exceptions. <br><br>If a person flees from the GM/Guide, logs out, goes LD and doesn't come back, in an attempt to avoid the warning (you'd be surprised how often that this happens), it is still applied. However a note is made that for some reason a warning couldn't be issued. <br><br>Regarding these boards, Akriss sends email to the email address on the station account, on the game account, or both (if they are different). If none of those email addresses are valid, the warning is still applied. Everyone needs to keep their email addresses updated in both places. <br><br>You can go into the Account/Change Account section of the login server to change the email address on your game account. You'll need to go to <a href="http://www.station.sony.com">http://www.station.sony.com</a> to change the one on your station account. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

However invisibility is designed to have a random duration, limited of course by a cap on the maximum. It is not supposed to be so reliable that you can avoid situations in which it wears off unexpectedly.

If you have 2000 mana, a 100 mana spell is a much smaller percentage of your total mana. <br><br>But to address the first posters question, the spell system is build upon spells taking mana. The exception to these are items with activatable effects, and the tradeoff in this case is a long casting time. Were we to implement things as you suggest, the casting time would have to be pretty long. We're left with the fact that you probably wouldn't have that spell memorized at the time you are jumped by a level 15 critter. Even a level 60 wizard can't memorize a spell when being attacked by a level 15 critter.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014054.html"><b>Random Loot</b></a><br>I think that you must have encountered an incredible coincidence.

As such, there are a LOT that I can't read. <br><br>I do however usually begin my day back on page 10 catching some of that was done in the off hours, however at around 11am, page 10 only goes back to about 6 or 7 am.

That suggestion is often labeled the "cure for camping". Unfortunately, increasing the supply due to increasing demand only encourages more demand. <br><br>In other words, if Oasis is crowded now with 80 people, imagine how crowded it would be if there was enough creatures to support however many people wanted to pile into the zone. As it is, we hope that someone walks into oasis, sees 80 people, says, "man, this is crowded", and goes someplace else.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014031.html"><b>"@" Bug Repaired Friay?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am wondering why they use the @ symbol at all, kinda annoying because sometimes I need to exchange emails, ohh well.

The posting machine codenamed Abashi was at it again this afternoon.  Here's the latest from the official forums:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014014.html"><b>"Take Away Mend from Monks"</b></a><br>You're asking for changes that would lead to there being no reason to play a warrior. Why would people want warriors if monks can tank just as well? They want monks because they do more damage than warriors even though they cannot fill the primary tank role very well. <br><br>You also have Feign Death, which is an excellent escape ability, and also allows you to lower yourself on the creatures hatelist mid-combat. Warriors do not get anything special to help them escape.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014006.html"><b>Pet Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It also seems like I can summon a pet with the 39 level spell that can be weaker (hits for less damage) than the best pet I could summon at 34 was capable of.]</i></font> <br><br>It is very possible that a pet summoned with a higher level spell can hit for less damage than a pet summoned with a lower level spell. Most often it would be the worst possible pet of the upper level spell compared to the best possible pet of the lower level spell. <br><br>Remember that max damage is not the only attribute that the pet has. Pets have skills just like player characters. Higher level summons will have better skills than lower level ones, regardless of the max damage. As an example, the worst 39th level pet may hit for less than the best 34th level pet, however the 39th level summon will have better skills and do more damage on average. <br><br>There's also the matter of pet hitpoints, which is another factor in the strength of a pet.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014008.html"><b>Useful New Skill Idea</b></a><br>I don't think that the AC and stats for an NPC would be of much use to the player since they mean something very different. Overall I like the idea of the skill, maybe it would apply well to resistances. It would be nice to see where the "weakness" is in those resistances. Of course, if we were to do that, it would only be a little while before all of this was known with certainty and it didn't mean much. <br><br>Hmmm, I'm not sure that it would be something that would work well in EQ, but perhaps might be appropriate for a future product where we could design around it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014005.html"><b>Friends List Cap</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: May I suggest removing the friends lists cap of only 20. The reason is that most people including myself have more then 20 friends to add. Since the friends lists are saved locally to our computers I believe that cause a problem with Verants servers. Please consider this request and if possible post your thoughts.]</i></font> <br><br>We're still considering this. We'll probably end up making the friends list differ on a per character/per server basis, however the 20 person limit is likely to remain. Lookups from the friends list are very processor and bandwidth intensive, leading to some non-negligible technical concerns.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013999.html"><b>Lack of Good Quests</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Come on verant, this is EverQUEST, the only quest i think i have EVER done in 35 levels is the Wurmslayer. Why don't you change the name to EverCAMP because thats all we do its dumb. Give us some more good quests!]</i></font> <br><br>There's currently over 1400 quests in game. Some are better than others, as things of this nature are always subjective based upon the opinions of those completing the quest. Some are simple, some are more difficult, some have a really high "cool factor" (Like the Lanseaux quests). <br><br>We're always looking for ways to implement more cool quests in game and appreciate all of the suggestions that are made here on the boards.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014002.html"><b>Nerf Overused</b></a><br>When the term "nerf" was first coined, it was directed solely at making an existing item, skill, ability, or spell less useful in some fashion or another. Since then it's morphed to mean "anything that we don't like". I personally don't believe changing drops or moving things around constitutes a nerf, it's just a normal part of the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013993.html"><b>Spell Drop-Rates</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I have a question. Are drop-rates of level 55+ spells correct now? I ask this, because there seems to be a serious lack of them around.]</i></font> <br><br>The Live team is going over the spell drops once again to be sure that they are all dropping at appropriate levels. One thing to remember is that not all spells drop randomly on creatures in all areas. Some spells only drop randomly in certain zones, while others only drop off of certain creatures.</UL>

Gordon made <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013926.html">post after post in a thread he started</a> early this morning on the Gameplay Board announcing some new changes to the chat and emote system:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>I'm still trying to get together a list of changes for this Friday's patch and will have final data tomorrow, but either that one or the one after will include some new features in the in-game chat channels.<br><br>In the last patch, we implemented the ability to expand the "@" symbol into the targets name when used in an emote. There was a problem with this implementation that will be fixed in the new one. However, the @ symbol has been replaced with a series of @-variables that expand into various pieces of information, and now works in all chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild).<br><br>The new @-variables are:<br><br>@T - Returns the current target<br>@S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It)<br>@O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It)<br>@P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its)<br>@R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters)<br>@C - Returns the class of the target (only works on Player characters)<br><br>Furthermore, animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type "/point Abashi", the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but you must specify the target as "say" (getting a bit complicated now, sorry). For instance, if my current target is "a gnoll", and I were to type:<br><br>/point say points at @T, indicating that he is ready to kill @O.<br><br>...my character would execute the /point animation, and the text output would be:<br><br>"Abashi points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it."<br><br>Custom text for canned animations must be directed at a target named "say".<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>Here's follow-up post #1:<UL>Hmm maybe I will get used to it though. But I'd never type @O when i could just type "it".<br><br><b><i>Ahhh, but if your target was one of gender, such as Baobob Miller, your output with my sample emote would be:<br><br>"Abashi points at Baobob Miller, indicating that he is ready to kill him."<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's another follow-up post:<UL>(Pertaining to your example) Wouldn't it be easier to do this?<br><br>/em points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it.<br><br><b><i>Perhaps, but then you'd have to type it out each time, and your character wouldn't actually point. I'd rather assign it to a social :)<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's follow-up #3:<UL>Oh and what do you mean by animations? <br><br><b><i>When you for instance type "/point", your character will outstretch @P arm (hehe) as if to actually point. That is an animation. There are many animations of this type, such as /nod, /tap, /cheer, /salute, /rude, etc. This have canned (predefined) text associated with them. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>The tireless Abashi continued to post in this thread:<UL>Will we get any new text for /rude?<br><br><b><i>Well I suppose you could set up a social as:<br><br>/rude say gives @T the bird.<br><br>...but be nice </b></i><br><br>This is a tad complicated. I take it you are suggesting that we assing 2 or 3 of our favorites to hotkeys for easy use?<br><br><b><i>I expect that will be the simplest use. I really don't expect people to type this out on the commandline each time.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Continuing on:<UL>This is really great, but I'm running out of socials here.. and hot keys...<br><br><b><i>Funny that you should mention that. We plan to include additional socials and hotkeys, either as part of the Velious client-enhancement or as a general issue patch. We're not sure yet.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's yet another follow-up:<UL>Some of them don't have animations.. just wondering if they will be for these or the old ones<br><br><b><i>Yes, it would only really work for canned emotes that already have animations. There are tons of these however.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Believe it or not there's more:<UL>This might be getting esoteric, but what about plurals? How about a plural for the race? You can't just add 's' to the race emote because then you'd get dwarfs instead of dwarves, and iksars instead of iksar.<br><br><b><i>Hehe, this was one of the issues that we spoke about. For right now adding an "s" yourself will have to make due. At some point we might make special arrangements for dwarves, elves, and iksar.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>All of this made sometime around 1:00-3:00am this morning.  Whew. :)

Gordon went on a posting spree on the Gameplay Board this afternoon.  Here's the first installment of today's infobit posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013984.html"><b>No DROP</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You know I always chuckle when they say something like that.. databases can be converted its done all the time a new field is not out of the scope..I truly believe that is a way to try and end a topic..now with that said a few disclaimers]</i></font> <br><br>You're making some assumptions as to the way character data is stored that isn't exactly correct. Though I can't discuss how we handle data storage in detail, adding fields to existing objects is not something that we can feasibly do without unacceptable risk. It would require conversion of all character objects on a per-character basis, resulting in a LOT of downtime and an unacceptable risk of data-loss (necessitating more downtime for a restoration).<br>--<br>I should also mention that several core facets of EverQuest were designed and implemented several years ago. For those things, we're a bit limited by what could be done easily at the time it was coded, rather than what can be done easily now.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013992.html"><b>Complement and Comments</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Lets get back to making viable gameplay suggestions without resorting to bashing]</i></font> <br><br>Definitely a good suggestion! <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I do hope that verant dosen't go overboard trying to make everyone happy, IMHO I am happy with the way things are now - Just get tinkering up to par as was promised in Beta and get on with making new zones, quests, etc....]</i></font> <br><br>We certainly have to excercise due diligence when making any change in the game, espicially now when virtually any change will upset someone. There's even people who are upset about the emote enhancements going in on the next patch. <br><br>Very true that we shouldn't go overboard trying to please everyone, but at the same time we need to try and remain responsive to everyone's concerns. <br><br>Thanks for posting everyone!<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013951.html"><b>Problem with Emotes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you did the @R thing and it gives you the target's race, would that also give their race if they were in an illusion? Would it give the illusion's race, or the ACTUAL race? If it gives their base race, that could be disastrous on the PvP teams server...poor enchanters.]</i></font> <br><br>@R will return the current race, so illusioned enchanters would be perceived as whatever race they are illusioning at the time. There is a problem with @C (class) that people brought up regarding anonymous people. We'll probably end up just removing that command, as further case-specific exlclusions would probably reduce it to the point of uselessness.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013929.html"><b>Changes in the Game</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you dont see EQ has a catalyst for creativity then you are in the wrong business. You should be creating a game that makes people be creative. It should challenge us to be creative. Without creativity we will get bored and run to the next game that comes along.]</i></font> <br><br>We certainly agree which is why EQ and other games of this type are so freeform. Some people prefer more guided content, and while we are going to work at providing more in that area as well, it will always be a game where the player makes the decisions. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Every nerf is a limit to creativity.

For instance, our decision that the number of memorizable spells will remain at 8 is based upon this. <br><br>We do however have to avoid "creativity" that results in a severe reduction of challenge, as we feel that challenge is important for the game. For instance, if someone finds a way to kill something 100% of the time without suitable risk, we need to address that issue to keep the game challenging.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013935.html"><b>Why should we report bugs?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, Why should I report bugs?<br><br>I love this game ]</i></font><br><br>I think that you've answered your own question. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If verant wants to know the other bug I will tell them but I think for major bugs a reward should be more then just a mark..]</i></font> <br><br>We currently have a reward program for reporting dupe bugs.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013941.html"><b>Halflings and Hide</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You personally do not get to know whether the Hide was successful.

It doesn't take anything additional, such as spells, skills, abilities, etc., into account. <br><br>From a gameplay perspective, I've frequently said that /con assumes that you are in a sufficiently talented and powerful group, which would typically be true, as the definition of "sufficiently talented and powerful group" changes based upon the group's makeup, and the level at which you are fighting.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013882.html"><b>More Reality</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My only issue with EQ has been a lack of non-bashing, non-camping things to do.

They were added in a post-production update. In any case, the fact that the game would change over time was stated in the EULA, and it's not "illegal" for us to make those changes. <br><br>Perhaps after the plane changes you will not be able to kill an NPC named "Cazic-Thule" at the same level you used to, but you will still be able to take on an encounter that difficult and acquire the similar loot to what you get now off of that NPC. Neither of those are, however, required by law. <br><br>From a game design perspective, top level encounters were always meant to be top level encounters, and if the top level changes, those encounters should as well. We made an exception in order to avoid putting them all out of the reach of those who chose not to buy Kunark by placing the level cap on Vox and Nagafen. The other solution would have been to buff them up to a level that is appropriate for level 60 encounters, which we desperately wanted to avoid in the name of servicing our customers.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013868.html"><b>Stealth Nerf?</b></a><br>I suspect that you may have been /coning a creature set to what we call "AggroPC", meaning that it attacks everyone without regard to faction. NPCs will only appear "Indifferent" in a /con if they have a reason that they wouldn't attack a player character. For instance, the guards in Neriak take faction into account when deciding whether or not they are going to attack, and would show "Indifferent" when invisible. NPCs that attack everyone, like hill giants for instance, show as "scowls" whether or not you are invisible.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013811.html"><b>Guide Account for Sale on eBay</b></a><br>This issue has been addressed.

Abashi</b></a><br>While I disagree with that piece, I do think that the complaints here are indicative of how responsive we are to player issues. If you go to sites that we do not post on, such as many of the class-specific boards or some of the news sites, you'll see a far greater ratio of positive posts to negative ones.<br> <br>Why is that? Because it's generally understood that posting complaints on those boards doesn't do any "good", where in this case it can do some good. I've lost track of how many positive things that have happened in game due to the number of player concerns that have been posted here. The sheer involvement and passion on this board is a testement to the fact that we do listen to the players. Sometimes we can't always do what a particular group wants, but I think that the majority of what we do is in the interest of the players as a whole. <br><br>I'm not going to argue the personal aspects of that peice beyond asking, does anyone really think that communication and action was better prior to my arrival? I do not believe that is the case. We've made great strides in our ability to act on player issues since that time. Can it be better? Sure, as all things have the potential to improve. </UL>

I bring word of an upcoming event that will crown the King of Thieves. <br><br>No, please don&#8217;t leave, I can see you are not one to trust easily. <br><br>I give you my oath that this is not a ploy by the local governments to bring the greatest of rogues together in one place to arrest them all in a single action.<br><br>Starting next Wednesday, September 20th, the greatest of all rogues will start their events in different regions, to determine the champion rogue. This period of time will last until Saturday September 30th. Then a final match on Sunday, October 1st will decide the King of Thieves.<br><br>What kind of contest you may ask? To be honest, I have not decided upon the rules for this historical occasion. That is why I seek the council of many of your profession. I wish to know what qualities make the greatest rogues.<br><br>Therefore, let it be known that on Friday, September 15th, we shall hold a meeting of the greatest rogues in the land. In the region of Test, in the old Arena of Lake Rathetear, at exactly 7 PM (PST), I shall meet with the greatest of rogues and discuss the upcoming event.<br><br>I am sure that someone of your talent can make it to this location easily. Please do not draw your weapons or start combat at this meeting, for the gods themselves will be very watchful. Keep you identities a secret unless asked upon by those that you trust.<br><br>Here we will discuss the terms of the event, and make it so that it will be a true test of the Rogues.<br><br>Fare thee . . . where did he go?<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Events Coordinator<br>Verant Interactive</I></UL>

This doesn't yet represent a final revision, but is the big step necessary to get to the point where we can call them all "revamped". <br><br>As part of this update, we are including trade specialization. Players will only be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally available tradeskills. This includes:<br><br>Baking<br>Blacksmithing<br>Brewing<br>Jewelcraft<br>Tailoring<br>Fletching<br>Pottery<br><br>Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be able to exceed 200. This does not include class or race-specific tradeskills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>Here's the second post:<UL>Did you FORGET that tinkering was a trade skill?? <br><br><b><i>No. Tinkering isn't a generally available tradeskill. You can exceed 200 in it, and any generally available tradeskill if you are a gnome.

Several new issues and a few old ones were discussed in today's evening edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013761.html"><b>More on Spell Slot Balance Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How would it be unbalancing to allow more than 8 slots for casting?]</i></font> <br><br>Not so much unbalancing as it would reduce challenge and strategy in a portion of the game where it currently exists. There's much strategy in determining what spells you will mem. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013730.html"><b>"I Quit - Because of the Tweety Situation"</b></a><br>I'm sorry that you feel that way. We'd certainly prefer to not have to moderate the boards, however its been proven that that really isn't possible if they are going to be useful to the average player and to us. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013754.html"><b>East Cost Fan Faire Choices</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why in the HECK would you hold an East Coast EQ Faire in ORLANDO ??]</i></font> <br><br>Because it's warm, a good number of EQ players live in Florida, and other people might enjoy popping down there to enjoy the weather for a few days around the gathering in February.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013715.html"><b>New Servers</b></a><br>We will announce the information once we have a firm date. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013638.html"><b>Invulnarable Healers</b></a><br>The possiblity of retribution always exists, since people of level to slay the "invulnarable healer" could always show up. I myself have seen people flock back home when it's heard that this is occuring. <br><br>In any case, the tuning team has discussed the issue and decided that this is part of life on the PvP servers, and it's not something that the GMs/Guides should be getting involved in. I'll see if I can get the word spread a little better on that issue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013642.html"><b>Invsibility</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why isnt invisibility like a mem blur?]</i></font> <br><br>It used to work like this in beta but was fairly quickly changed. It was too powerful of an escape spell to farm out to so many classes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013589.html"><b>Downtime and Friday's Patch</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: ? I solo a lot, (Im a 31 Druid) and my night usually consists of, fight for 2 mins, start meditating, press play on DVD player, watch film for 10 mins, pause film, fight for 2 mins, start meditating, press play on DVD player.... you get the point, Im seriously running out of films to watch..]</i></font> <br><br>You might consider fighting in a group. People soloing a single spawn will likely encounter more downtime than they would if they were in a balanced group. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: ok, now thats of my chest, on the patch comming on Friday, are we getting all the new GUI updates mentioned? as in the 10 pages of 12 hotbuttons....12 pages of socials...and movable windows?]</i></font> <br><br>There are some things that we're working on that will be implemented into the existing client, and other things that are reserved for the expansion. As these decisions are made we'll announce what is going where.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013584.html"><b>Zones and Experience</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Let players know which zones give best exp]</i></font> <br><br>That's something that the players can figure out through the course of the game. I won't give out specifics, but here is a general rule: <br><br>Dungeons typically give better experience per kill than outdoor zones.<br>Sparsely populated zones typically give better experience per kill than crowded zones.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013566.html"><b>Embrace Camping</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is only one way to solve this problem - bring the server populations back down to their intended population levels.]</i></font> <br><br>Though likely to improve the situation somewhat, it's not really a solution. The Test server which only has a couple hundred people on it at peak still has people camping items. The newest servers averaging around 1500 people at peak also have people camping items. <br><br>I truly think that the only way to stop camping is to make things more rare across the board, or to somehow detect camping and dynamically reduce the reward based upon the length of the camp. I know that many have suggested just the opposite, but you cannot discourage people from engaging in a behavior by providing more rewards for engaging in that behavior. <br><br>I know that others have suggested that we look at it from a different angle, and strive to reward "doing" rather than nerfing "camping". However the current reward rate, whatever the method of acquiring that reward, is already sufficient. <br><br>My idea is to dynamically reduce the chance of a creature to drop loot, and reduce the experience garnered, the longer the person has been camping. It's not however something that we'll see in EverQuest, due to the way spawns and item creation works.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013557.html"><b>What is a Nerf?</b></a><br>Good point Orm. As I've mentioned before, what is an enhancement for one class is often determined to be a nerf for another, even when no actively negative change has been made to theirs. Take the monk issue as an example. No negative change was made to them. All of their skills went up, but since warrior skills went up more, even though they are by and large still less than the monk skills, the enhancement to warriors is perceived as a nerf to monks.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013564.html"><b>Producer Letter Abandoned</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Has Verant abandoned the producer's letter as a means of communicating thoughts with the player base? The last one was from April and I notice Brad is announcing significant things such as the upcoming class balancing freeze on the boards now instead.]</i></font> <br><br>No, it hasn't been abandoned, but we have been short on content due to our continual posts here on the boards which get broadcast to the playerbase. Many of the subjects we've chosen to discuss here would make excellent content for the Producer Letter, however we've preferred to have two-way communication. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What is the purpose of the Producer's letter and will it ever again be updated?

The following report was sent in by Namini:<BLOCKQUOTE>Date:  September 12, 200<br>Server:  Karana<br>Zone:  West Commons<br> <br>Early, on the morning of the 12th of September of the calendar denoted "Earth Time" I was found to be ridding Nektulos Forest of those pesky creature Dark Elves and their element Guardians.  A cry was heard from upon the trees that rabid will o wisps were ravaging the Commonlands.  Highly amused, I set it upon myself to discover the nature of this occurence.  Upon my arrival I did find that the claims were true.  Aged wisps, surely the Ancients and Elders of such species and undoubtedly the most skilled, had set it upon themselves to seek revenge on those who had so often killed their younger brethren.<br> <br>I found myself wholly underskilled to even approach these creatures without fear of soiling my plate armor.  However the nonethereal troops were out in force.  Champions of all races, occupations, and allegiances had come upon the Commonlands to banish these aged wisps.  I noted many champions whom I had had the pleasure of meeting before, such as the warrior Rams, the ranger Mirax, and Gigo, a halfling whose occupation escapes me.  Many deaths were seen, but scant few were of the wisps.  The flitty creatures had mastered many magickal arts, and knew well how to heal themselves and, probably the most trying skill of these creatures, were able to flick out from the fray as the whim to do so captured them.  While I myself was, as I said, too underskilled to slay such ethereal might, it was said that the small points of light beared great treasure for those who conquered them, including rumors of a Hooded Black Cloak which beheld many mysterious powers.<br> <br>The battle raged long and I served my champions as best I could by summoning other great masters of the arts to assist in the conflict, or by distracting the smaller beasts of the land which I could readily slay, but the more skilled should not be bothered to handle.  Though much blood was spilled, the ethereal creatures were finally destroyed, or at least, they perhaps gave up the fight and retreated to whatever hidey-hole in Norrath they had produced themselves from.  Unlike many a great battle I have seen concluded, there was no great hooplah, nor was there a declaration of victor and wonderful prizes bestowed on the most powerful.  There was only to be seen many great warriors dragging themselves, bloodied, back to the beds from which they had been so unceremoniously torn.  For those of us who suffered less in our injuries (only for the sheer undesire to involve ourselves against the wisps at all), we stayed a bit longer and were greeted by the sight of three lesser dieties by the names of Maell, Jacynth, and Parentis (whom I had seen dallying around the eastern commonlands before hand, most mysteriously).  The three were very pleased indeed to see that the Ancient and Elder Wisps had been destroyed, but as I said, these lesser dieties declared no victor, nor bestowed no great gifts (however much we pestered them to!).  <br> <br>The battle was great indeed, they said, and would be recorded in the great annals of Norrathian history.  I was pleased to be a part of this great occurence, and it was indeed and great achievement for our Norrathian champions.  Perhaps one day, I shall put it to a song...<br> <br>Namini Dolce<br>Bard of the 21st Season<br> <br>(On an OOC note, Guides Maell, Jacynth, and Parentis, as well as the Head Karana GM whose name I can't spell, did a wonderful job in this event.  It was certainly a change from the norm!  I would especially like to thank Guide Maell who was gracious enough to stay into the wee hours (3:30am pacific!) and answer a great barrage of questions and pesterings from myself and others.)</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

Gordon made several late night/early morning posts on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013475.html"><b>Verant PR</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Now I've been in a few MUDs, including one that demanded a monthly fee, and nowhere else did I find this disconnect between the users and the "gods" of the servers. None of those (admittedly primitive) MUDs found the players regarding the sysops with such naked contempt.]</i></font> <br><br>I disagree that there is that much of a "disconnect" given the scale of what we are doing here. I think that we have far more communications with our customers than other service companies out there this size, in or out of the game industry. The MUDs of old have a much smaller playerbase to deal with and thus have a much greater chance of pleasing everyone with the decisions that they make. That's a rough thing to do at this size. Consider this, more poeple have played EQ than live in the state of Wyoming. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Yeah sure you always had your share of bellyachers but here, I've seen some seemingly decent ideas and valid questions prefaced with lines like "I'm sure this will be ignored, but what about.." and "I know Verant doesn't give a **** but this would be cool.."]</i></font> <br><br>I really hate to see people prefix their posts like that as well, because it virtually guarantees that the post will go unanswered. Answering posts that are prefixed with some negative statement designed to promote a response out of spite get us off on the bad foot, and just encourage more posts of that type. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Average players I've been in pick-up groups with treat /petition like the lotto: good freakin' luck. For them patch messages are out of left field (What is this moss twig, and why is it being nerfed??). And they're always seeing another "stealth nerf" behind every new situation, failed/useless spell, or bad death experience. (Stealth nerfs exist but I have no idea how widespread they are.)]</i></font> <br><br>The foreseen "stealth nerf" is certainly our fault due to repeated problems with getting the appropriate things announced to the public. We've made great strides in that department over the past 9 months, and I think that we'll continue to improve. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And some staff members with Verant have slipped into a bunker mentality: it's us against the ignorant, whining, class-envious players who play 20 hours a week and then complain about how awful the game is. ]</i></font><br><br>I disagree, concerning the bunker mentality. Again, I feel that we have a great deal of communication with our customers. We not only have me here on the boards every day, but Aradune, Rowyl, Ester, Hobart, Akriss, people in customer service and tech support, as well as Yak over on the tradeskill board. These others weren't "ordered" to come post here on the boards, they chose to because of their committment to satisfying the customers and their respect for customer opinions. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'm just an ignorant consumer so I can't say.. however I DO know that this discontent will continue until EQ is no longer the hyperpopular online game it is now. ]</i></font><br><br>As I mentioned in another thread today, that's the natural cycle of these things. If you visit the boards for the other games out there, you'll see the same type of thing that you see here. There is always going to be a percentage of players for whom we fail to fulfill our goals. Considering our over-70% retention rate over 18 months, and the fact that we are still growing and adding servers, I think that we're doing fairly well over all. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Un-gag more staff members. Letting the coder in charge of the UI, and the guy in charge of tradeskills speak was a stroke of genius! Why don't we see GZ speak out anymore? What's the deal with the gag orders in the first place??]</i></font> <br><br>GZ is involved on another project but still consults with the EQ team and will always be the ArchMage :) We do have to place some limits on how many people can be out here in the public light, and how often, since they of course are working on ways to add content to and improve the game. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Fire Gordon Wrinn. I'm sorry Abashi, nothing personal at all ]</i></font> <br><br>I don't know why you would expect that I wouldn't take this personally. See my comments above about negative posts in threads. To be honest, had I read this before I started responding I wouldn't have. You have a good post here for which you've harmed your credibility. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013471.html"><b>Camping, Rolling for Loot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi doesent count, he works for VI so camping items isnt the same for the rest of us. The in-game play isnt the same for Abashi as it is for any 50+]</i></font> <br><br>I'm tired of seeing this comment, and ones like it, and having to come in and say over and over that it isn't true. It's an accusation without merit. Brad, I, and others who post here have said again and again that no, we don't cheat. We do not "play" EQ in "God mode". That wouldn't be any fun.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013415.html"><b>Fear and Charm</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi Will Fear and Charm be disabled for the Best of the Best]</i></font> <br><br>It's hard to say. Daegarmo will decide these issues when it's time for a class with these abilities to take center stage. When those issues are worked out, it will be announced.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013424.html"><b>EQ Fan Faire</b></a><br>I don't think anyone wants to go to New York in February :)<br>--<br>Ack! I don't even own a jacket warm enough for that :)  GO ORLANDO!!<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013418.html"><b>Account Question</b></a><br>It depends on whose name the account is in. If it's in your name, and just on your friends card, it's fine to switch it to your card.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013294.html"><b>Squeaky Wheel Gets the Grease: The Ranger Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There's always the impression that the "squeaky wheel gets the grease," so to speak. I would hope that Verant isn't doing this solely in an effort to appease the people who scream and threaten about the supposed nerfing of rangers. I hope it's simply a matter of peoples' concerns being looked into, and then, found to be accurate. But the attitude I've seen today is one of "If we ***** long enough, Verant will make our class better."]</i></font> <br><br>No, the changes weren't a "thrown bone", but I fear that impression that we are oiling the squeaky wheel is going to be about impossible to avoid. Let me say that class-issues on this board do impact what we choose to look at, once we can assign it a priority. The number of people complaining though really doesn't affect the outcome of what we look into. In other words, once we first stated that we'd look into the issue back in July, the continual loudness of the issue didn't impact our decision process. <br><br>As I've mentioned before, believe it or not, class enhancements typically cause a larger PR coup than nerfs. With a nerf, we have only the affected people plus a few sympathizers that complain. With enhancements, most complaints come from those who weren't affected, which is undoubtedly a bigger group. We get complaints from classes that are now "useless" because of the enhancement, and further complaints from other classes who feel that either they should have been the ones most deserving of an enhancement, or should be the next class to get an enhancement. <br><br>I've noticed many posts from people here who believe that periodic class-enhancements are an entitlement; that we are systematically looking for ways to enhance the classes. This is illustrated by many posts that begin with something along the lines of, "[class] haven't received an enhancement since [last enhancement] and are due". Just to be clear, we are not systematically searching out ways to make classes more powerful, and are generally of the opinion that the classes are well-balanced. Does this mean that we can change our opinion once looking into something further? Sure, but we don't see any glaring issues out there in desperate need of improvement. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You see... on any given day there are at least 20 threads of how rangers Wizards or bards have some kind of problem. However, I can't find ANY posts from unhappy necros.]</i></font> <br><br>They've been here. These things go in cycles. All classes have been represented in one drive or another for a change to the class, most of them several times, in the past 9 months. Some have been more of a constant drone, while others come in loud spurts with relative silence in between. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013149.html"><b>More on VP Loot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ever heard of the term, "Bait and Switch". They Bait you in with easily attainable loot to begin with, then SWITCH on you. They move this easily attainable loot elsewhere and replace it with inferior loot, while moving this once attainable loot to extremely difficult areas (Veeshans).]</i></font> <br><br>You've illustrated the problem fairly well there with "easily attainable loot". Loot of quality should have a difficulty associated with that quality. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My theory is simple. When Kunark was being itemized, all Kunark dungeons were loaded with really nice stuff, far better than anything before Kunark, to keep people interested and playing the game.]</i></font> <br><br>There's some things that only become evident upon people entering the zone and acquiring things on a large scale. That only happened recently with Veeshan's Peak, so some changes were inevitable. </UL>

Back on the Gameplay Board, Gordon <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013406.html">posted a small preview</a> of the upcoming patch:<UL><I>I just got word that one of the things to be patched Friday will be a change to corpse decay for high level creatures.<br><br>NPCs corpses 55th level or above will decay in 30 minutes rather than 5. We ended up deciding to make this change due to the difficulty of getting the dead back into VP to collect their loot in light of it all going NODROP.

Here's a compiled list of the many board posts Gordon Wrinn has made this evening on th e Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013405.html"><b>New Server Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: PS Probably a little out of the subject, but do you still know if there is going to be any newbie servers?]</i></font> <br><br>Of the two servers on order, we're not sure yet whether only one or both of those will be a split server.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013257.html"><b>Board Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When you decided to make the boards avaliable to subscribers only I knew what you were trying to do. You actually believed that the "whining" would go away because you created a great game and only those people who quit the game were disgruntled and kept posting here to stir up the "silent minority".]</i></font> <br><br>No, we never believed complaints would go away. We did however believe the constant baseless flames would go away, because that's what we were going to commit to make happen. We also hoped to see more people who formerly only lurked for fear of being flamed come onto the boards and let everyone know their thoughts as well. We've made great strides towards both of those goals. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The reason that it did not go away is because, although you created a very immersive game, you have made some bad decisions in the design, testing, alteration, and expansion phases of the game.]</i></font> <br><br>The concept of "bad decisions" is entirely subjective. What one person thinks is a bad decision, another person thinks is a great idea. In any case, we'll be the first to admit that the game isn't perfect, but it is inline with most of our goals and as such is responsible for the number of people that choose to play it. <br><br>No game can be perfect, and at some point continuing to tweak it to get it closer to "perfection" in *our* eyes will sooner or later take it further away from that goal. Perfection is subjective as well. I've yet to see any subject that 280K could agree upon. Even the latest UI changes which hurt NO ONE still had poeple who disagreed with the changes because they felt we should be working on something else that was important to them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It is not our fault that this is so. How could it be the players fault that we are losing interest in a game that we love and feel so passionately about.]</i></font> <br><br>Who says that it has to be anyone's "fault"? Growing disinterested in a game over time is part of the natural course. I just wish that instead of people saying, "I've played a year and a half, wasted 150 days played 4 level 50 characters, and you've finally upset me enough that I'm quiting", they'd say "OMG! I've played for a year and a half and put 150 days played into my 4 characters! I've never had something keep me this interested for this long. It's time to move on, but I just wanted to extend my thanks for the entertainment. It was well worth the money." <br><br>Frankly, if someone plays for a year or a year and a half before quitting, we feel that we've done our job well, regardless the reason stated for quitting. A computer game keeping someone interested for that long is truly amazing, and we're happy that our game was one that could do it. Over 70% of everyone who has ever purchased EverQuest is still subscribing today, and that is a fantasitc testement to what we're doing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Dont talk to me about burn-out either. There is a difference between baing burnt-out on a game and getting tired of the negative changes imposed on that game.]</i></font> <br><br>Oops, too late, I spoke about burnout already. Anyway, I've found that people who are ready to quit are looking for a *reason* to do so, rather than quitting just because they've had enough. These changes are excellent fuel for that. I sincerly doubt that anyone goes from completely happy to "quitting" over one minor change such as the stats on one item or the location of a drop changing. <br><br>You talk about "negative changes" like "negative" is a factual statement when in fact it is an opinion. Take this Veeshan loot issue as an example. People want risk and reward to make sense. We're going to make it make sense. That is a positive change if we are implementing what people want, right? A great many people have posted how some loot in other areas belongs on dragons. This was truly a case where it wasn't a case of items in VP being underpowered as much as it was a case of items elsewhere being overpowered. We can't keep raising the power of items found at the higher levels every time an item shows up in the mid levels a little more powerful than expected. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013372.html"><b>Necro and AoE Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: All other classes get them. Clerics get group heals, shamans get group buffs, druids get group wolf form ETC. Shouldn't we get group DMF or a AoE fear, lifetap or something??? As well as we dont get lev till 44. Why can't we get dead man bobbing at a lower level? The only AoE spells we get are the ones for close combat and do no real damage so are of NO use. Any input would be nice..]</i></font> <br><br>Necros pay the price for their superior single-target offensive power by getting little in the way of group-benefit spells, and all of them are single-target in nature. You do get a line of point-blank AOEs however.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013391.html"><b>/Con Biased?</b></a><br>Some classes excell at soloing, others at grouping, some can do either just as well. Strangely enough, the two top soloing casters and the top soloing meleer (for the most part) aren't on the top of everyone's "must have for the group" list. <br><br>It's worked out quite well in that regard. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is the main prob I have with this, as I understand it the higher the mob cons to you the more xp you get if you kill it putting classes such as warriors who have to group at a xp disadvantage.]</i></font> <br><br>I disagree. I've illustrated before on the boards how a group can get more experience than a soloer in most cases. Though members split the experience, they are killing things so much faster and with less downtime that it's more efficient for most applications. <br><br>Of course, if all the group is going to do is sit in one place camping a single spawn killing no faster than a solo caster of the same range could, the group will of course advance slower.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013187.html"><b>Clerics</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Proposed Solution would be a group variant (and lvl 58 is way to late in the class life to get this ability, how many cleric do yuo think will ever be 58?). I suggest at 52 a group version of Pinzarn be available ]</i></font><br><br>How many clerics will ever be 52? More than reach 58, sure, but that's not really an argument for changing it. The 58th level spell is certainly a nice benefit for reaching that level. Until you do, perhaps those you are buffing could share in the cost of the components. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Invisibility - We get group and single invis undead, no invis live. I think we are now the last class with no ability or item (without charges) that can't invis.]</i></font> <br><br>There are other classes that can't do something that other classes can. Class interdependancy is based on this. For instance, it could be aruged that necros should be able to case their invis upon others since every other class that can cast invis can do this. This isn't, however, how it was intended. Clerics can do so much for a group in other areas, it makes sense that they would have to rely on the group for some things as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: AC Lines.. SoW cost so mouch to cast.. Why should we burn 300+ mana for an AC buff, this seems like a awfully large jump in mana cost from AoF. We should see this buff reduced to the 175 mana range.]</i></font>  <br><br>It's a tradeoff. If the spell costs too much to cast, and is not worth that cost to you in that case, it's your option to choose not to cast it. If the group on the other hand wants every single stackable buff possible, it's going to cost more in the way of mana, components, and time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013243.html"><b>Non Agressive Dragons</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I haven't seen the one in Emrald Jungle, but I have seen the one in Dreadlands a few times. The thought occured to me that wouldn't it be great if these beasts would give a quest of some kind?]</i></font> <br><br>At some point there probably will be, but not just yet. Those dragons operate on a timer while the dragon is idle until it depops. Any time they respond to quest text, that timer is suspended. We had NPCs in the game like this at one point, but found that people were able to get them to stay around indefinitely by constanly /hailing them. <br><br>At some point we might change the way those timers work, so ruin your faction with those dragons at your own risk :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013177.html"><b>Kunark Upgrades Postponed?</b></a><br>I believe that Brad said we were running a couple of weeks behind. I certainly do expect to see the Kunark upgrade available once again prior to the release of Velious. We just want to be absolutely sure that there are no repeats of the fulfillment problems with Kunark.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013151.html"><b>Displeased with Kunark</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: From reading this board, I used to think Kunark sucked...I rarely went. Receintly, my guildmate told me to go to FM. I am hooked now. The exp is great. I belive that since the MOBs are harder, the experience for them is also boosted. I suggest killing lower things than you are used to, or play a class more known for it's solo ability.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for the note, and you are indeed correct that with the harder NPCs comes more experience. That's how it should be :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013172.html"><b>VP Loot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Can't you add a few high-powered items to the dragon drops instead of completely nerfing Sebilis?]</i></font> <br><br>We're not going to "completely nerf" Sebilis or any other zone, just balance item allocation out in a manner consistant with risk. There are some items from Sebilis that will certainly move to Veeshan's peak as common loot on the dragons there. Yes, the dragons in VP have common, rare, and ultrarare drops.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013120.html"><b>Bothersome Buffs</b></a><br>I know that this issue was brought up back in beta, and it was determined at that time that it shouldn't be too much of an issue. That said, anyone using the spell in an offensive manner would be in violation of the rules of conduct. <br><br>If players do find this to be a big issue, I could look into seeing if these types of spells could be limited to group only.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013123.html"><b>Magical Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: do got a question: its 35 right? not 32 as ya thought (med without a book)]</i></font><br><br>It's been a while since I was looking forward to the magic level. I'll go whip up a character tomorrow and get it straight in my head.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012579.html"><b>Morell-Thule Problem</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Our server will have to ignore both Nagafen and Vox and favor a large amount of time sitting on our collective duffs, praying to whatever EQ god that the boats mess up and Faydedar is forced to repop.]</i></font> <br><br>I don't understand your complaint. Are you saying that you won't be able to kill Vox and Nagafen but will be able to kill Faydedar? <br><br>Or are you saying that people powerleveled past 52 before there were enough people capable of taking on Vox or Nagafen?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013084.html"><b>10 Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) With the update of parry and dodge for rangers being in 'fine tuning' when can we reasonably expect for it to go live?]</i></font> <br><br>Friday. We postponed the patch for this and a couple of the other issues that we wanted to get in. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) With the lowering of cast time on jolt to go down, when can we reasonably expect it to go live? Also will it still maintain its high resist rate?]</i></font> <br><br>Should be this Friday as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) How will the implementation of the upgrade to parry and dodge be introduced? I.E. will it just be allowed to progress from its current level or will it be maxed out to your current level? i.e. im level 55 and say dodge is increased to 225 would i expect it to be maxed at 220 for my level or would it begin to work up from its current level. ]</i></font><br><br>The increase in the cap will give you the opportunity to build it naturally. No skills will be auto-accelerated to the cap. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) The UI tweaks. Will we have to wait till velious to see them go live?]</i></font> <br><br>Some yes, others no. It turns out that one of the stunning changes that I alluded to earlier this week is one on the Velious plate, so it won't be going live tomorrow. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7) Regarding trade skills, would it be possible to actually have a new title at skill 200 such as grandmaster? (seems this would be pretty easy and quick but not of high importance, but im quite sure many of us would appreciate having a title other than master just for self gratification) ]</i></font><br><br>Only if it fits into Rowyl's new UI issues. This is more related to art than "vision". <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 8) Can we get all the gms together and make a rock solid rule regarding some pvp issues that are affecting Rallos Zek server such as what defines corpse camping, bind camping, and when it is allowable to engage a person after killing them. ]</i></font><br><br>If the GMs are going to intervene in these matters at all, I doubt that any rule could be "rock solid". It's all highly subjective in nature. <br><br>I'll check into the questions I didn't answer.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013097.html"><b>Spell Slots</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But abashi is very firm on this topic, he wants to keep it like it is. Its not going to happen, I wish it would though. It does force you to use strategy.]</i></font> <br><br>Indeed. 8 spell-slots is absolutely firm, like melee-binding, the game being group-oriented, and the experience system. It's a core foundation of the game that isn't subject to change. <br><br>Though in all fairness it's not solely my decision, but one made by the design team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011858.html"><b>A Bard's Role</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: All I know is how I perceive my role in EverQuest. Let me explain how I see it in the hopes someone from Verant can explain where I differ. For me, a bard is the ultimate group member. We are designed to operate most effectively in the company of others. We are often called a Jack of All Trades, but a master of none. We have so many abilities that are spread among several other classes. Need someone to buff your attack speed? A Bard can do that and more at higher levels. Need to slowdown a mobs attack speed? A Bard can do that and more at higher levels. Need a boost to your resistances? A Bard is one of the best at boosting resistances. Need to regenerate health or mana faster? Again, a bard can do this. Need to charm a creature for a short while and make him your ally? Bards. Need someone who can wear armor and take a FEW hits ok? Bards. Need to get from one location to another fast and teleports or gates are not feasible? Bards.]</i></font> <br><br>While I'll leave in-depth determination of "role" to those playing it, I think that you've answered your own question here. Bards are good at so many things, you're surely here to do some of those things. I feel that Bards excell at making a good group better. That's my opinion. What's more important though is, what is a bard's role to you? If you look at it as a walking-talking mana battery, there's not really much I can do to make you feel better about it. It's the same issues with the clerics who often complain that they are a walking-talking hitpoint-battery. You are a support class. You support the group, and you do it very well. Whether or not you are happy with that role is up to you.</UL>

Brad wrote a follow-up to his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013030.html">Veeshan's Peak loot post</a>.  Here's the entire message:<UL><i>The following was my third post regarding the subject prior to the thread corrupting (*sigh*):<br><br>I don't mean this in a condescending way at all, but I honestly wish some of you would at least try to put yourselves in our shoes.<br><br>What options do we have in these situations?<br><br>First, let's establish a few facts: <br><br>1. This is a dynamic game. It may not be as dynamic as some would like with massive invasions and huge volcanic eruptions and entire NPC governments taking action that affect players' lives, but it DOES change. We add to the game, we change the game, and some times we take away. (Actually, it makes me worry for when the technology is such that we can do all of that stuff -- how will people respond... 'That volcano created a mountain where my favorite hunting grounds were and blocked the entrance to my favorite dungeon and now I have to walk farther to the new entrance at the top of the crater! You nerfed me!'). <br><br>We cannot have stagnant games, yet when the status quo changes, SOMEBODY always get's upset, especially if the change is not universally positive (and what change is?).<br><br>2. We're not perfect! We will make mistakes. We will continue to make mistakes as long as we continue to add content, and things will be out of balance in the future.<br><br>3. We learn and get better. For example, lots of universal class non-specific loot like Rubicite is bad. <br><br>So, what options do we have:<br><br>1. We could just leave mistakes and aspects of the game that didn't turn out as planned. I think that leads to stagnation. I also think it leaves areas of the game untouched... empty zones, ignored quests, etc.<br><br>2. We could upgrade the VP items that are weaker to what they should be. This doesn't address the other items that are too powerful relative to their difficulty to obtain, but it would address one side of the problem. The problem is that they'd be comparable then most likely to the other broken items. Many players would then simply try to obtain the broken items since they are as good as the upgraded VP items but easier to get. And we'd still have broken items.<br><br>3. We could upgrade the VP items and make them better than the non-VP broken items (and not adjust encounter difficulty). Here's where the MUDflation comes in. Now, what have we done to all the other items in the game... they're all indirectly weaker now. And, we've set a new (lower) standard of risk vs. reward. The game becomes less challenging, etc. <br><br>4. We could upgrade the VP items and make them better than the non-VP broken items (and then re-adjust NPC encounter difficulty throughout the game as well as other treasure tables everywhere, raising the entire risk/reward ratio but keeping it balanced). This, by the way, is what the infamous mud wimping article would have us do -- either that, or nothing. Basically, it's a ton of work and would probably introduce a whole slew of new problems and potential for mistakes. Bluntly, we'd rather allocate those resources elsewhere.<br><br>So, our solution is to identify the non-VP items that are out there that are too powerful and probably move them to VP. And then take some underpowered VP items and move them elsewhere AND/OR make some new items to replace the over-powered ones.<br><br>I also want to emphasize that there really aren't that many items. Also, just to let you know, MORE of this is going to occur when EQ Live starts revamping old world zones (Permafrost, Najena, etc.) We will be adding new content AND moving existing content around.<br><br>I know this isn't compatible with some players' feelings that how and where things are in the game the day they started playing MUST also be the same 3, 6 or 12 months later. But, with all due respect, that's simply NOT how MMORPGs work. As mentioned earlier, if anything, MMORPGs will become MORE dynamic and less predictable/dependable in the future.<br><br>In closing, I'll quote from one of the EQ Live game designers emails to me regarding some of the items that very well might change -- I want to emphasize again that there aren't that many we're talking about:<br><br>"Broken Weapons include: Blade of the Black Dragon Eye, Warding Star, Runed Fighters Staff (Somewhat easy to acquire, godly proc ratio), Moss Covered Twig (we all know this one), etc.<br><br>Those are a few examples of broken items which have been acquired by players and severely hamper our attempts to create new and interesting loot. The players should be made happy soon however. We just went through and nerfed the drops of those broken weapons and "added new content" -- replacement new items. Near copies of some of the broken weapons are being placed into VP." -EQ Live Game Designer<br><br>-Brad<br><br>p.s. I know this might encourage people to camp more short-term, but I wanted to be up front and detailed with all of you nonetheless. Heh, everything's a trade-off.</I></UL>

I just received the following announcement from Verant's Cindy Archuleta:<UL><I>Greetings!<br><br>You might want to note that there have been two important announcements<br>added to the Sony EQ Board. Both are Real Life Events that are designed for<br>the players. <br><br>First, on November 4-5, players are invited to attend the Velious Launch<br>Party in Las Vegas! They can meet other players, the Velious Development<br>Team and have a chance to play on the new Velious continent before it is<br>released! They can also win great prizes, including signed copies of the<br>expansion pack (to be shipped when it is shipped to the retailers).<br><br>Also announced is the next Real Life event I will be coordinating. The EQ<br>Fan Faire will be held in February in a yet to be determined East Coast<br>city. Check out the site to cast your vote for our destination! <br><br>Visit <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/">http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/</a> for more information on both of<br>these exciting events!<br><br>Cindy Archuleta<br>Community Relations Manager<br>Verant Interactive</I></UL>Thank you!

Gordon's made quite a few posts on the boards this afternoon.  Here's the latest from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013109.html"><b>Twinked Corpses</b></a><br>Interestingly enough, the GMs get /petitions every night from people who lost a twinked up corpse like this. Needless to say that it isn't something that we can intervene in.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013119.html"><b>Resist Bug</b></a><br>I'm aware of this happening at resists over 255, however this is the first I've heard of it being over 200. Are you certain that this is the case?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013106.html"><b>Abusive Users</b></a><br>If she's being threatened in that manner, she'll want to /report the text then /petition to let the GMs know that a /report has been filed. Providing that the /report shows the threats, he'll certainly be removed from game. I'm not really sure why she got the response that you've indicated, so if more information can be provided I'll be happy to look into it. <br><br>Secondly, if she has a restraining order against him, chances are that it prohibits any contact between them. The courts would probably not be too happy about learning that he's contacted her on the internet.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012952.html"><b>Putting Stuff in the Bank</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Would it not be easier to be able to put thing in a bag that is already in the bank?]</i></font> <br><br>This is indeed one of the UI enhancements on Rowyl's list. I'm not sure yet if it's one that will make the final cut due to the number of good suggestions, however we'll give it a shot.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012966.html"><b>Dupe Bug Question</b></a><br>Good suggestion Wyld, and to answer Sabaack's question, we'd certainly take intent into account. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013068.html"><b>Class Changes</b></a><br>We have nothing in particular planned right now. We do plan on retesting all of the classes to ensure that they fall where we feel that they should prior to freezing the classes. Most of these tests have already been completed for most of the melee classes, with only a few more steps necessary to finalize those.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012942.html"><b>More on the Story Elements in EQ</b></a><br>On one hand we have players asking for more of a story line to be overtly implemented into the game. On the other, there's also those who prefer an open "floorplan" if you will. In either case, we want to provide for both players. <br><br>"Story" requires that some limits be placed on the breadth of things that players can do. There's really no way around that. Whether the story is done in short bursts, such as quests, or in large multi-zone epics, there is some limit on what you can do to take part in the story.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012754.html"><b>Determining Balance of the Classes</b></a><br>As the game is and always will be primarily PvE (Player versus Environment), balance in this area has always been the chief concern. Even on the PvP servers, PvE is still the main focus there and affects everyone whether or not they engage in PvP regularly. <br><br>That said we also try to keep things in mind for PvP. For instance, the damage reduction for spells cast by players upon other players is one of the PvP balance mechanisms.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009851-2.html"><b>EQ's Plot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I believe Abashi or Aradune said that there would be a way for verant to relay storied to the players in the future well it must be the DISTANT future because it hasn't happened yet.]</i></font> <br><br>I wanted to wait until I had a time nailed down for this: We'll be debuting a section of our website dedicated to stories in a couple of days. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009837.html"><b>Abolish Disease</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The biggest question here is why aren't the priest classes equal in their ability to deal with diseases and poisons in the end?]</i></font><br><br>Because the classes aren't designed to be equal, but to be balanced. If they were equal they would be interchangable in many cases. As it is designed, you must often make a choice with what class you want to be near. If you are going up against something with really strong poison, you certainly want clerics around. For disease, you'll probably want to add a shaman. If you are looking for something a little more general purpose, there's the druid, with respectable DD, DOTs, healing, buffs, and ports.</UL>

Gordon started this week's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013130.html">Discussion of the Week</a> on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the complete post:<UL><I>I think that there&#8217;s a common misconception going around that, &#8220;All dynamic events consist of GMs going on a killing spree.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t the case, as there are many different types of dynamic events, ranging from the typical raid, to story-telling events, to epic quests with a vast story-line behind them.<br><br>Raids are typically short on story and last anywhere from a half an hour to an hour or two. They usually consist of trio of actor NPCs or so entering an area and running amok until they are killed by a sufficient force of players.<br><br>Story-telling events typically have little-to-no fighting of any kind, and are usually used to tell a story leading up to or concluding an epic quest.<br><br>Epic quests often run several hours and boast a slew of actor NPCs that both tell a story and engage in combat at some point during the quest.<br><br>In addition to these, there are also &#8220;Invasions&#8221; which are more static in nature and deal with a temporary data reset of the zone. Examples of this have been the period undead invasions of Qeynos Hills, or the recent one in Najena that was launched with a small epic quest.<br><br>We realize and agree that there have been problems publicizing the story behind dynamic events, and will be launching a new section of our website in the next couple of days to deal with that issue. However, the question I would like to pose is, what do you want to see in the way that dynamic events are handled? It seems that no matter the event, or the story behind it, there are always some people who felt that the event was nothing but a &#8220;killing spree&#8221;.<br><br>What can we do to make these events more enjoyable for the players?<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>
