Azarr Windtree brings us the following announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail and Well meet fellow Norrathians,<br><br>Allow me to introduce myself I am Azarr Windtree Mage of the Mysts and <br>member of the Great Atani Guild. I come here to inform you all of a great <br>saga just begone. The saga began one night hence as I traveled through West <br>Freeport, I happened apon a small band of my fellow Atani at the Theatre who <br>sat quitely listening to a man named Hicor, so being the curious mage I am, <br>I to stopped to listen to the Hicor's tale. He spoke of his friend Nyplid, <br>who on the very day of his wedding had been manhandled and spirited away. <br>Nicor told of how he had investigated Nyplid's disapearence. His <br>investigation had of course begone were Nyplid had last been seen and soon <br>came to believe that the dark races of Norrath may of had something to do <br>with Nyplid's disapearence. Though he found no strong clues he did find a <br>note posted in one of the local taverns that spoke of a Shadow from another <br>realm. The Shadow could not come into our realm nor could he take a person <br>from this realm to his. Yet the Shadow had followers here in Norrath, ones <br>of the dark races. Two of which the names are known, Drodak a Troll and <br>Androdameia a Shdowknight. Turning up know other clues, Nicor decided to <br>investagate the sewers of Freeport as it is rumored that the dark races <br>inhabit them at times. Nicor said he began his search in the sewers and came <br>apon a Darkelf, but though questions many times the Darkelf only ignored <br>Nicor. After more investigation of the sewers he had come apon a piece of <br>tatered cloth, the cloth had strange symbols as some sort of writing. He <br>himself could not translate it to the fullest yet know that the cloth had <br>something to do with the Shadow.<br><br>We had all sat quitely listening to the occurance of poor Nyplid's <br>kidnapping and of the search for him when Hicor asked that who among us <br>would help to locate Nyplid and return him safely home. Out of the Atani <br>that were assembled there four responed I being one of them. The others were <br>Granaut A dwarven cleric who liked his ale, Nacacia a halfelf rogue, whos <br>bueaty hides her deadly skills, and lastly Lowelf a druid, a blessing to <br>know. After the four agreed to help, Hicor handed me the tatered cloth and <br>told us to seek out a friend in Felwithe named Delcaraa, but that she might <br>be hard to see as her mother was sick and that she had left her post as <br>Cleric for the fireworks company Kaboom to tend to her, but we might seek <br>out Cahboom who also worked for the comapny and he might aid us to find <br>Delacaraa. Hicor did warn us not to let Cahboom see the Cloth as he would <br>destroy it, why I am not sure. Hicor then left after thanking us for the <br>help we offered. The four of us sat a moment and talking about what to do I, <br>Nacacia and Granaut decided to set sail on the next boat that left for <br>Faydwer. Lowelf decided he would go alone, as most druid seem to be loners <br>most of the time, but he would keep us informed if he found out anything. We <br>arrived shortly at Faydwer and headed to Felwithe, at the great wizard <br>spires we meet the Gnome Kahboom who was interested in hiring our dwarven <br>cleric friend as a replacement for Delcaraa until she could return to work, <br>of which Granaut agreed, "so if by chance you are in Faydwer and here a loud <br>boom know that Dwarven ale and fireworks do not mix well." After talking to <br>Cahboom he agreed to lead us to were Delcaraa lived, apon ariving and <br>introducing our selves she asked that the others leave and of course I asked <br>that Cahboom leave as well so that we could talk in private, but unknown to <br>Delcaraa, Nacacia had used your stealth to sneak back in. I then took out <br>the tatered cloth from my backpack and showed it to Delacaraa, she stood <br>back in amazment. Asked if she might have the cloth to investigate it. I <br>agreed, she took the cloth and said that it would take at least a week befor <br>she could tell me more of what it was and perhaps how it fit into Nyplids <br>disapearence. We left her to her studies "I was thankful to get rid of that <br>piece of cloth if made me fell very uneasy holding on to it."<br><br>Knowing how well my drawven friend likes his ale we decided to head to the <br>local tavern in Felwithe for a few rounds and some discussion of the events. <br>We all drank to the day and to the hopefully safe return of Nyplid, not <br>knowing what the future would hold. We all agreed on meeting one week hence <br>to find out what Delacaraa had to say. I look forward to what lies ahead.<br><br>Azarr Windtree<br>Mage of the Mysts Azarr Windtree<br>Atani - <A HREF="http://www.atani.com">http://www.atani.com</A></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon replied to the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039688.html">following post</a> on the Gameplay Board regarding a bug with one of the Rogue's new weapons:<UL>I finally got what turns out to be an extremly nice rogue dagger (locustous *spelling sorry*) 8 damage 17 dealy with Effect: walking sleep (level 5ish shaman). Now I was thrilled that my friend actually got this for me. I couldnt wait to try it out. OMG...... I was imediately told to put it away by the shaman and enchanter in my group. It cancles there high level tugurs/slow spells. Since when can a level 5 spell cancle a level 40+ or higher spell out. So basially since most groups i get in either have a shaman or enchanter in them ill never be able to use this weapon. Well there is the off chance that I might just go out soloing with it (not). Please if you could either put a different effect on this weapon, take the effect away, or make it so the effect doesnt write over the higher level spells.<br><br><b><i>We've acknowleded the bug. The spell supercedence rules try to figure out what spell is "better" and causes it to overwrite the inferior spell. It assumes that "higher values" = "better". The attack speed debuffs are the only spell where lesser values in the database yields a better spell. <br><br>It's on our list, but I don't have an ETA.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

GameOver has kicked up <a href="http://www.game-over.net/review/may2000/kunark/">another review of Kunark</a> awarding the expansion an 86% rating.  The review also comes with some nifty screenshots.  Here's a quote:<UL>The Ruins of Kunark does exactly what an expansion pack should do. It expands on the experience known as EverQuest and improves it at the same time. Graphically, the new zones look better. Combine that with the addition of a new race, a new continent, the change from level 50 to level 60 characters, new items, spells and creatures and you've basically got a fantastic addition that is a must for EverQuest adventurers. </UL>Use the link above to read the rest.

The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038211.html">first post</a> talks about his Wizard character:<UL><i>The "Abashi" character is an Erudite wizard, and has been since inception, except for a short stint as a gnomish enchanter between Beta2 and Beta3. <br><br>I haven't had a wizard as a play-character since beta .5 - beta1 when I built one to level 12, then changed to a different class because there were no more spells available.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039635.html">second post</a> about the Shrink spell:<UL>(not the ants potion...which is same as shrink spell and only works in dungeons). I'd like to clarify something: <br><br><b><i>That sounds like a bug, as the potion version was supposed to be "Shrink Everywhere". Someone evidently applied the wrong spell to that particular potion.

Another <a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/reviews/game_review_678.html">new review of Kunark</a> can be found on the pages of the DailyRadar.  The rating Kunark receives from them is a "Hit" (one of the site's best ratings).  Here's an excerpt: <UL>Unfortunately, the expansion pack wasn't completely finished by the time it launched on March 24. Many of the sounds weren't put in -- it's rather strange to listen to your lizard character make human sounds while striking a scorpion. Of course, the scorpion itself doesn't have any sounds -- whenever players hit it, they hear their own cries in its stead. Other difficulties arise as a result of the game's beauty -- the higher polygon counts mean reduced performance on slower machines, so if you ran EverQuest slowly, you'll really move through molasses in Kunark. The higher polygon counts are only in the new lands added by the expansion pack, however, so the older areas of the game will still look -- and play -- the same.</UL>

A few posts were made recently on the Gameplay Board by Verant's Gordon Wrinn.  Here's the skinny:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039617.html"><b>Kerra Faction</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Befor the Kerra Isle remake when you killed them you got several positive faction bonuses. This allowed a Erudite SK i hade made gather enough faction to walk thry Erudin and make it do the boat. Well they no longer give faction positives!!! so my new Necro cant increase his faction. Please return the faction to where it was before. Thanks!]</i><P> The only positive faction that they gave before was something like "High Guards of Erudin". However, no NPCs were ever assigned this faction, so there wasn't a benefit from building it up. I'm not sure how your SK got to the point that he could walk through Erudin, but there are other means of raising faction with the townfolk.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039612.html"><b>Shacke of Dust & Corpse Decaying</b></a><br>These chain-quests are designed to reward those who protected the item from inception and through each step of the quest. I would recommend that people put the shackle in the bank until they get to the point that their corpse stays around a while. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039574.html"><b>Kunark Sound Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post:  Just a quick question: When are the sound issues on Kunark going to be addressed? I'm sure I'm nto the only one who's sick of hitting just about anything and having it grunt like a human...]</i><P> They've been addressed in code already, we just need to get them over the live servers. It's looking like the week after next for the next patch.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039480.html"><b>Gameplay Board Rules</b></a><br>That type of conversation has no place on these boards, and the moderators will delete them as we find them. We can certainly ban the station names that post this stuff, of course they'll just be able to create another until we get the code in to only allow EQ subscribers to post here.<br>--<br>I assume you speak of the post at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039436.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039436.html</a> <P>It's on page 5 at the time that I'm answering this post. This board uses an index system where the most reacently posted-to thread is moved to the top of the list. <P>We don't remove posts just because we don't like the contents. If we did that, I think that the majority of the posts on this board would disappear.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039455.html"><b>Lag Spikes</b></a><br>I'm sorry that I didn't get back to comment on this issue earlier. We've been looking around for things that could be causing what the players have been pointing out. We did find one issue that could cause something like that for a period of a few seconds, and that was being exacerbated by a network problem on a couple of servers (Quellious and Morrel-Thule) that has been fixed. But we haven't been able to find anything that could cause the 5-20 minute periods of this that some people are claiming. <P>I'm willing to keep looking into the issue.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039429.html"><b>Gordon's Customer Relations Skills</b></a><br>I normally don't like to get involved in this type of thread, but in this case I think I should since the way I phrased the comment can so easily be taken as a flame. <P>In the past I have from time to time said some things that were a bit harsh, but I've *never* outright flamed anyone, and that wasn't my intention here either. My intention was to try and explain the situation to the person I was replying to to their satisfaction, which wasn't done in the first post of his that I answered in the Kunark Faction thread. The purpose of my final comment was to identify a reason that I might not be explaining the situation clearly enough, and let him know that I was open and willing further address his issues until he was satisfied. <P>That said, in retrospect, I should have come up with a different way of stating my intention to help that couldn't be so easily misconstrued as a flame. As I mentioned above, I've never flamed anyone, nor would I, particularly someone with valid concerns. <P>I apologize to anyone that was offended.</UL>

The posting machine known as Gordon Wrinn made a few more posts in the last hour.  Here's the info ripped straight from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039201.html"><b>More on Solusek Ro Faction</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Although the blurb seems promising, the deity related items are presently few and far between. Further, there is a nasty SR faction problem in Kunark. This may be addressed (it should be next patch) but you are likely best off playing the middle and remaining Agnostic]</i><P> The original author mentioned that he was playing a high elf. Just to be clear, the Solusek Ro faction issue at the evil outpost would affect a high elf. He'll be fairly well hated there regardless what deity he chooses. But yes, we will be changing the faction offset for the Dark Elven worshippers of Solusek Ro and Bristlebane in the next patch.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039034.html"><b>Compelling Reasons</b></a><br>The "compelling reasons" why someone might choose to play one class, and another person a different one differ from person to person. I'll take a stab at how we look at it. Here's an example of two melee classes: <P>If a monk had the hitpoints of a warrior, could equip all of their armor, and didn't have the weight restriction, what would be the point of playing a warrior? The monk has a bunch of nifty skills and can do more damage with their bare hands than the warrior can. There's be no compelling reason to play a warrior if the monk could do everything better. <P>Now monks and warriors primarily compare damage dealing potential, but you also have to factor in other skills. The monk for instance can feign death. This also contributes to balance, even though it has nothing to do with offensive power. <P>Every class has something that they can do better than some other class. That does not necessarily mean that they are the *best* at that particular thing, just that they can do *something* better, and also do something worse. As an example, a cleric can heal better than any other priest class, yet their offensive spells are not as good as the other priest classes. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039244.html"><b>Invoke Fear Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: While feared, pet kills her. I receive no XP.  There seems to be a problem that when feared, you will not obtain the XP for the kill.]</i><P> This is true, and it's not really a bug per se. When feared you are basically an NPC. When your pet kills her the system looks for where to assign the XP and doesn't find a valid PC. This isn't something that can be changed without making major changes to the core architecture. </UL>

Gordon Wrinn made a big post concerning various faction issues in Kunark on the Gameplay Board a few minutes ago.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039204.html">the post</a>:<UL><i>With the number of posts about dungeon factions in Kunark, I wanted to take an opportunity to address them all at once:<br>Yes, it is correct, fighting in several dungeons in Kunark will lower your faction with VenrilSathir, and thus make conducting business in the outpost in the Overthere a bit rough. This is intentional, and is not a bug. It's also necessary for the political environment of Kunark to make sense, and our stance on it is firm. There are consequences, the importance of which each person has to decide for themselves, for killing everything that moves.<br><br>We're not forcing anyone to fight anywhere, or to stay out of any particular zone. Like all faction issues, it is your choice whether or not that faction is important to you. This is the same choice that players of good alignments had to make when deciding whether or not to kill things that give them bad faction. It's a personal choice. Being KOS in the evil outpost does not put the spells that are available there out of your reach. You certainly have the ability to have someone else, who is not KOS there, complete the quests for you. Evil races are KOS throughout Faydwer as it is, and people get along fairly well there. Kunark is not meant to be an encapsulated environment that people never leave. We expect people to have to go back to the mainland from time to time to get supplies and such. If you make yourself KOS to the outpost, there are other ways for you to get into Kunark without going through it. <br><br>So just to summarize, the factions are intentional. I suggest that everyone consider their options carefully before making a decision on how to tackle the continent.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

How often had he thought of his mother&#8217;s death? How did it happen, or did that really matter? How often had he himself brought himself to the brink of death doing something stupid on the plains or the northern shores? Maybe death would be welcome. He definitely needed a drink.<br><br>Minutes turned into an hour which then turned into two, and finally the Elders emerged. Aolis made it short.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Enjoy!

Gordon was once again back on the boards answering questions and talking about many different EverQuest issues.  Here's the latest from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039068.html"><b>Buffing Your Allies</b></a><br>I understand your argument, however the only reason we were able to make the 51+ buffs as powerful as we did was based upon them not being able to be cast upon drastically lower in level. If you are over 51 and you wish to group with someone out of the range for some reason, you can feel free to buff them, however you'll still be limited to the 49 and lower spells. <P>Some of the 51+ buffs have serios increases to duration, with some lasting a full 2 game days. That's some serios power, and we don't want it being used to enhance buff-twinking.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039070.html"><b>Is Kunark in retail stores?</b></a><br>Yes, it is available in the stores. Until we can get the online store back up, that is your best option. Just make sure you pick up the box with the lizard on the front :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039072.html"><b>Kunark Items</b></a><br>This is another case where it is not our goal to make everyone the same. We don't want everyone of a given level to be clad in the same equipment. Equipment that is able to be widely used by a large number of race/class combos also encourage camping, something that we would like to see go away. <P>Restricting items by race and class works towards this goal.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039094.html"><b>Zone Misconceptions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Lavastorm and Sol A/B have some very small hallways, very poorly designed. Shrink is Verants fix for this, but only shamans have it and it only works in dungeons. So the hallways in Lavastorm really suck.]</i><P> You've got it a bit backwards. The zone was designed specifically to give you a hard time because of your size. That size, and the stats and abilities that come with it, isn't supposed to be without its disadvantages. <P>As for the subject of this thread, we did put in a shrink-anywhere potion, yes?<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039117.html"><b>Lure Series</b></a><br>You are missing the elegance of the Lure series. <P>The Draught series of spells is about fast-casting good-ratio mid-range damage spells. They let wizards deal damage in smaller chunks making it less likely that the target will want to play a game of eat-the-wizard. <P>For the elegance of the Lure series, please allow me to quote a section of your original message: <P><i>[Quote from original post: I've casted it quite a few times now and have cosistently gotten 640 damage]</i><P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039064.html"><b>Mana Regen</b></a><br>The mana-regen rate is constant regardless how much mana you have left when you start medding. I think what you might be observing is an issue with the resolution of the mana bar. For instance, I've always felt that the last 1/2 bubble took longer to med than any of the others.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039057.html"><b>More Iksar/Plate Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I was wondering is the inability for Iskar warriors and sk's to wear plate a matter of not having the skins completed yet, or as a further balancing issue? If so how is not letting us wear plate types armor explained?]</i><P> The inability of Iksar to wear plate is in the original design doc for the expansion. It's *not* a matter of skins not being "done", but because that it was specifically planned that way. <P>The reason that they cannot wear plate is that it chaffes their scales. But fear not, those same scales also give them an innate AC bonus :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039059.html"><b>Iksar AC Bonus</b></a><br>Yes, Iksar have an innate AC bonus based upon race. Monks also get an innate AC bonus based upon class. The Iksar monk gets both the race and class-based AC bonuses.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039062.html"><b>Summoning Mobs</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Wouldn't it make sense for mages to be able to summon mobs to them. I think give mages a spell line that allows them to summon(teleport) a mob to the front of them would not take a way from any other class and just make the game better.]</i><P> Doing something like this would have bad effects on the game. It would trivialize cases where creatures are meant to be encountered in groups when it succeeded, and would cause awful trains when it failed. <P>Though we apprecaite the suggestion, it really wouldn't work out well for EQ.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039055.html"><b>Fizzling Rates</b></a><br>There have been no changes to fizzle rates. If you've been following the boards here for a while, you'll notice that this subject pops up about every 3-5 weeks. The last time that I'm aware of fizzle-rate changes taking place was late beta when fizzles were made to happen less.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039039.html"><b>"Get Out of Jail Free" Spells</b></a><br>Nothing is meant to be a get-out-of-jail-free card. Even "Gate" has the opportunity to fail. Spells can also be resisted. Feign Death failing upon a successful cast is basically the same as a creature resisting your spell.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039023.html"><b>Shaman Spell Bug Report</b></a><br>I've forwarded this to GZ. I'm not sure what the deal is with them, the one with the higher slowing effect should overwrite the others. It sounds as if there might be a problem with whatever determine whether higher or lower numbers is better.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038871.html"><b>Realism</b></a><br>Realism must sometimes be bent in the interest of gameplay, balance, and hardware requirements. Not to mention that I think that people might get upset if we got rid of magic, and everything besides lions, wolves, and bears.... <P>(Say it with me) <P>Oh my! :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038873.html"><b>Balance and Fun</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Verant cares more about BALANCE than FUN]</i><P> We don't view these two concepts as mutually exclusive ideas. We instead believe that balance is necessary in order to promote fun, and thus the longevity of the game. <P>If all avenues to promote "fun" were pursued without regard to balance, we believe that people would get bored with the game and quit.<br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: How about, If all avenues to promote balance were pursued without regard to fun, I believe that thousands of people who bought this game would quit out of frustration and leave nasty posts about Verant's "vision".]</i><P> Absolutely. The door swings both ways. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Guess what, it's happening.]</i><P> But no, it's not. EQ has consistently gained subscribers every week since it was release. <P>One thing that I think most people understand about MMOG's is that people who leave them tend to leave because they are unhappy with something or bored. It happens, but unlike in singleplayer games where people can win them, then put them in the closet never to pick them up again all the while remembering them fondly, it's usually some event that causes people to leave MMOG's. This leads to unhappy people posting on the boards, and would happen regardless what the Vision(tm) was. <P>That's not to say that peoples complaints are invalid. They are far from that. Everyone has different reasons for playing these games and everyone has a reason that is at least valid to them when they quit. Though we can't apologize for the Vision(tm) itself, since it is what makes EQ what it is, we definitely apologize to those who left the game due to issues that we can all agree were bad, such as overcrowding or periods of excessive downtime. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038874.html"><b>Kunark Refunds</b></a><br>The refunds are being processed as quickly as possible and emails are being sent when that occurs. There's a fair amount involved in the whole process, such as verifying that the original order was placed and that it hasn't already been refunded. We appreciate your patience. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038928.html"><b>A Visit To Your Local Dungeon</b></a><br>Thanks for telling the story. It's nice to read these once in a while, and also nice to hear about people "doing" dungeons. <P>The aggro range is what it is due to the design of the tower. It makes the dungeon a little bit easier than we would like, but increasing it causes some really nasty trains. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038868.html"><b>Customer Service Editorial</b></a><br>I'd like to thank you for writing this wonderful editorial. Both the positive comments and well-deserved criticisms are well received.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038820.html"><b>Why can't NPCs tell us more stories?</b></a><br>Definitely a good idea. We do believe that the world could use more inert content (content provided for the sake of content). One of the concerns is that people often expect any talking NPC to lead to a quest. In the case that you suggest, the only purpose of the story would be the story itself, and some people might get frustrated by that thinking that they had to search for some keyword to get a quest. <P>The EQLive team has come up with some wonderful inert content ideas, and you should start seeing things happen soon.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038818.html"><b>Old Producer Letters</b></a><br>Links to the old producer letters are supposed to be listed at the bottom of the current one. I just looked at the one we have up now, and this was apparently overlooked. I've asked the web team to pop the links for the old ones on the page. Thanks for letting us know.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038805.html"><b>Artifact Questions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: ARTIFACT means that there is only one of these items in the world (server) right? How could an Artifact drop from a MoB that respawns then?]</i><P> The item that was recently found (a paladin sword) was marked as an artifact by mistake. It will be changed the next time we do items. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Can you give ALL No Drop items to NPC's?]</i><P> Yes, but it's meant to be for items associated with a quest. <P><i>[Quote from original post: If so does killing the NPC let you loot it?]</i><P> Nope. This was a nasty little nodrop transfer bug that we stomped sometime back. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Giving NPCs some items does leave that item on their corpse.]</i><P> It used to do this, I don't believe it does any longer. However it's been a while since I handed something to an NPC and later killed it :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038805.html"><b>Item Tag Listing</b></a><br>Here's a list of the current item tags as listed in the EverQuest ROK Manual Supplement: <P>MAGIC ITEM: This means that the item is imbued with magic. If this item is a weapon, it will have the ability to damage creatures which can only be harmed by magic/ <P>LORE: This means that you may only have one of these items in your possession at any one time. If you attempt to acquire another, you will not be able to pick the item up. This will check your bank account. <P>NODROP: This means that the item cannot be traded to another player nor sold to a merchant. However, you can hand the item to an NPC, which is necessary for many quests. <P>ARTIFACT: This means that the item is unique upon the server that you play, and that there will never be another one given out. Artifacts are usually earned through participation in dynamic quests that occur in game regularly. Artifacts however remain so rare that most people may never see one, much less own one, which is why they are called Artifacts of Great Power. <P>A Deities name: If a deity&#8217;s name is listed upon the item, it means that only followers of that deity may equip the item or use its effects. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038612-2.html"><b>Firepot Exploiters</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: To allow these early exploiters to remain bound in the FirePot room is unfair to Wizards, Druids, all melee classes, and every- one who did not receive their Kunark CD in a timely manner. It also sends the message that it is ok to exploit known bugs, as long as you do it quickly.]</i><P> We really don't have the capability to move everyone out of there all at once. For those who actually are bound in the room, I don't think that it will be very long before they change their bind points voluntarily. Also, I really don't think that it is fair to call those that bound there "exploiters". There's no reason to expect them to have known in advance that we didn't intend it to be like that. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037238-2.html"><b>Guild Tag Loss Issue</b></a><br>The guild-tag issue has been a very elusive problem, and we've been unable to duplicate it on demand in the test environment. The programmers have been looking for what might be causing it. If anyone has any way to reproduce this problem on demand, we'd love to hear about it. You can email me directly at <a href="mailto:gwrinn@verant.com">gwrinn@verant.com</a><P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038583.html"><b>Problem With Kunark Zones</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: There are lines...I can take a step backwards in places in FV and the mob I am fighting toe to toe will wander off(usually by poofing) and usually back to a pile of his friends I step back over the line and wait a few minutes and slam the baddie and eight of his friends attack. I know exactly where this line is. ]</i><P>Sounds like a pathing issue where the creature loses track of the best way to get to you, tries to run to a new patch, which ends up taking them out of pursuit range. The fact that they come back after you just means that you are back in pursuit range and are again a valid target. You don't actually leave the hate list, and aren't meant to. The pathing issues are something that needs to be fixed. If you can get specific LOCs of places where this happens (they turn around and run off), please let me know and I'll get them to the team.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037315.html"><b>Bad Paladin Piercing Weapons</b></a><br>The item database is huge and complex, containing tens of thousands of items. Mistakes do happen. <P>What's the name of the particular piercing item that has paladins listed? Also, if you all want to post items with blank effects, I can get those fixed pretty quickly.</UL>

Gordon's been at it again making more posts on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038833.html"><b>Simple Fix to the Killstealing Issue?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: A very simple way to fix this is increase the spawns. More often than not, I find that the people in my group have full mana and full health. The problem is, that we have nothing to do with this mana and health, because there are never enough mobs to kill.]</i><P> Increasing spawns does not decrease overcrowding, it in fact encourages it. If we keep increasing spawns as more and more people enter the zone, sooner or later things are going to break because there's nothing to encourage people to leave the zone in search of more fruitful hunting ground. <P>We don't want to encourage people to jump on a never-ending hack-and-slash conveyor belt, we'd rather encourage them to explore.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038832.html"><b>Finding Spells Beyond 50</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I've yet to see anyone casting a spell past 50 they didn't buy at their vendor. In almost 3 weeks of playing, I've yet to hear of a single post 50 spell dropping off a mob.]</i><P> I've got the EQLive team checking on this. I'll get back after I get the report from them. Just one note, Kunark has only been live for a week and a half :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038839.html"><b>My hard earned faction went from Amiable to Threatening!</b></a><br>This does indeed sound strange. Are you sure that you haven't done anything (quests, etc.) that would cause something like this? You seem to know your way around factions pretty well but I have to ask. <P>Anyone else have anything like this happen recently?<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038796.html"><b>No Experience from Blues?</b></a><br>This doesn't sound intentional. Is there any other information that you can give that can help us track the issue down? Is anyone else having the same problem? It's possible that we might have an unaccounted-for overflow somewhere due to to the size of the numbers that we are working with now. Any additional information would help.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038758.html"><b>Shooting Arrows</b></a><br>Shots with projectile weapons are allowed or disallowed based upon the delta-Z (Difference in the value of the Z-coordinant) of your feet versus the creatures feet. It was primarily done to disallow some exploits that are possible in the event that there is no control. The downside is that if you are standing on a hill, and for instance a sand giant is at the bottom of a hill, you might not be able to fire at it even if it is at eyelevel with you. <P>We could look into increasing the maximum allowable delta-z if that would be helpful.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038786.html"><b>Group EXP Screwy?</b></a><br>There are some limited cases where something like this can happen due to the way the group aggregate damage system works. Due to the way everything interacts, changing the system further probably isn't feasible. <P>On an opinionated note, it does seem like a bit of poetic justice to hear about melee types accidently KS'ing from casters :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038787.html"><b>Meshing Zones</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Are there plans in the works to add more content to the zones other than Kunark to "mesh" the old world with the new? For example, an NPC in Neriak that wants you to get something from a zone in Kunark, or a quest from someone in Overthere Outpost asking for supplies from "home".]</i><P> We are constantly planning an implementing more content, quests, items, etc. There are already many quests in that "link" the two continents. I've heard that there's even an Iksar prisoner in one of the old dungeons :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038683.html"><b>Feign Death</b></a><br>Well, I suppose pretending that you are someone else and convincingly pretending you are dead are two different things. <p>Really though, we didn't want to hand out Feign Death to everyone, and not everyone can have every skill, even when it's cool and incredibly useful (especially when it's cool and incredibly useful). When we started looking for a way for rogues to reduce their "hate" value, feign death was an option but we thought it would be cheesy to just duplicate another skill. That's how we came up with Evade.<p><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038033.html"><b>Spell Balance</b></a><br>These spells are balanced. I think that once people have an idea how they work, they'll pretty much agree. Until then however I'll leave you to debate them :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038156.html"><b>Rules of Conduct</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The Basic Rules of Conduct are agreed upon when one logs in. Period. Correct?]</i><P> Yes, that is correct. <P><i>[Quote from original post: These rules are in place to protect players from the abuse of the Basic Rules of Conduct. Correct?]</i><P> This is also correct. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Those rules, when logged in and playing EQ are a contract between Verant and the subscriber. Correct?]</i><P> Well, they are a contract between the publisher of the game (Sony Computer Entertainment America/989 Studios) and the player. Verant develops and operates the game for the publishers, who authorize us to set policy and enforce the rules of conduct. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Are players protected by the Constitution of the United States and the First Amendment "Free Speech" or are they in a private fantasy world, governed by the basic rules of conduct put into place by Verant and agreed upon by the player?]</i><P> The latter. EverQuest is a private service and as such is not governed by the Constitution which protects people from the government. By using our service players agree to abide by the rules of acceptable conduct that we require for continued use of our game. <P><i>[Quote from original post: If players are protected by the rules of conduct, and players file /reports and petitions about player abuses of the basic rules of conduct, how are players to know how many /reports or petitions have been filled against an abusive player?]</i><P> Players have no method of acquiring this information. It is for the private use of the EverQuest customers service staff. I have heard a few suggestions that we should implement something along the lines of a public Feedback system used by Ebay, but that would have the potential for abuse. <P><i>[Quote from original post: If players and Verant are in a contractual agreement when playing EQ to play by the rules of conduct. Is Verant in breach of that contract if "abusive" players are allowed to continue to play after numerous /reports and /petitions have been filed?]</i><P> No. We have specific rules for dealing with issues and define what exactly is entailed by the term "abusive". We typically need concrete evidence that the rules of conduct have been broken (such as a /report or the incident being witnessed by a CS rep), and then act, at our discretion, based upon the severity of the infraction. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038210.html"><b>More on Spectre Model</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Before, the excuse was used that enchanters couldn't get any more illusions b/c it would take too much memory to add another file to the global index. This spectre image has been added to the global file, and there is no reason not to give this to us.]</i><P> I think I might have mentioned this in the other thread, but the spectre model has too many poly's to have two classes able to create spectres on demand. System resources are unfortunately finite, and we have to keep EQ usable by people with Voodoo1 cards.</UL>

Since being announced last August, it has it managed to garner both considerable interest and a very active fan community by promising to bring fresh ideas, novel twists and some unique races to a game environment that will also contain many familiar fantasy-based elements. <br><br>We were, of course, right at the front of the line for information when the game was announced, obtaining the very first Horizons interview.  We have hosted the very busy <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/default.asp?cat=5014" target="_new">official Horizons message boards</a> since that same time, and have also been following development very closely.  <br><br>Today, as we celebrate the opening of our new Horizons Vault site, it is our pleasure to present a new <a href="http://horizonsvault.ign.com/features/interviews/dallen0005.shtml" target="_new">Horizons Interview</a> with David Allen, the game&#8217;s Executive Producer as well as CEO of developer Artifact Entertainment. <br><br>As at our other dedicated sites, Horizons Vault will focus on the player community with complete game information, thorough community news coverage, the message boards, concept art, screenshots, humor, reader and community participation features, humor and much more.  New content and features will be appearing on the site very shortly.  Enjoy!

Several new posts were made by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board over the last few hours.  Here's a rundown of them all:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038373.html"><b>Iksar and Natural Hate</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Confirmed from a test server player that the only thing that Iksar monks lack is the natural haste that human monks have been given.]</i><P> No they don't.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038425.html"><b>Manaskin Bugged?</b></a><br>It's not bugged. Manaskin only adds a very small amount to the mana-regen rate. The resolution of each "chunk" of mana that displays when medding is probably too large to show the additional 10 mana/minute that this spell grants.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038433.html"><b>Ethical Debate about Online Store</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Has anyone else noticed that the online store went down THE DAY retail boxes hit the stores? And has been down since then?]</i><P> We didn't feel that it would be right to keep taking orders while the shipping problems were going on. The timing is coincidental. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Why on earth would Verant do such a thing?]</i><P> Because we didn't want to put more orders through the system until we were sure all of the issues were worked out. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Could it be that Verant is trying to force the players who decided to wait into the local software stores? Why would they DO such a thing?]</i><P> We wouldn't. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Because the retail ROK cost's $40, (but it comes with a brand new copy of EQ!!!) and Verant and their distributors need to move these things off the shelf]</i><P> I'm very sorry that you are upset about the store being down, but there is no conspiracy. We took the store in order to be sure that we could serve our customers better. The higher price of the ROK retail box has nothing to do with it, we'd rather you buy the expansion directly from us anyway. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Wonder how long the Online Store will be down....]</i><P> I just got an update on it today. Things are starting to look better, but we won't bring up the store until we're sure everything is working ok. As soon as we can give you an ETA we'll post it. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Harvey, the expansion IS a brand-new copy of EQ... you can either use the CD key to enable a new account, Kunark Enabled and all, or you can use that key to upgrade your existing account.]</i><P> Just to clear this up, no it isn't. The key that comes with the expansion can only be used to upgrade an existing account. The key that comes with the retail version can be used either to upgrade or to create a new account.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038712.html"><b>Balance Not About Equality</b></a><br>Though I do thank your for taking the time to post your opinion, balance is not about equality. It's not about making everyone able to do the same thing in the same time with the same amount of risk. <P>The equality that you suggest is incompatible with the concept of a class-based system with class-interdependence. There are a few games out there that support class-less system which you may find more to your liking. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038789.html"><b>Pick Pocketing Questions Answered</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Just wondering if you can pickpocket something that someone else is fighting?]</i><P> Yes. <P><i>[Quote from original post: And if you can would that not be about a the same as Ninja looting, except you do it before the creature is dead.]</i><P> Not really, the ninjalooting restriction primarily applies to special items. Since rogues can't PP anything but coin and the odd non-magical item, it's not really a major concern. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Oh one more thing is thier any way to tell if a rogue comes up and steals all the loot off of what your fighting... that is if he can?]</i><P> If the critter scolds him perhaps :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038365.html"><b>Equipping Weapons on an NPC</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: If you're going to nerf us, nerf us all the way. <P>Before the delay necromancer pet nerf, giving a pet a halberd, and then giving them a dagger would make the pet equip the dagger rather than the halberd.<P>This was because the pets preferred lower delay.<P>Now that their delay has a minimum of 30, they still seem to prefer low delay weapons. In other words, giving the pet a short sword, then giving the pet a halberd, the pet would keep the short sword. <P>If youre going to nerf, clip all the attached strings.]</i><P>It's not a bug. All NPCs use the same code to determine whether or not they will equip a weapon and what weapon they will equip. The fact that the lower delay doesn't work for pets doesn't change that. I'd recommend that you don't hand your pet a dagger after you give him the halberd if you want him to wield the halberd.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036020-4.html"><b>Shaman Spell Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: We get this spell at 29 and it now has a lock so you cant charm anything higher than 26??? PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THIS CAN BE USEFUL????? AND WHY IT WAS DONE?]</i><P> With levels going above 50, we had to put in code to catch caps that were controlled by the level ceiling before. One of these was a safety net for charm, which caught this spell. Assuming that they don't have it already (my spell list is dated), we'll be giving Shaman the higher level animal charm spell with a higher cap. <P>I apologize for this not being in the patch message.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038074-3.html"><b>Level 51+ buffs do not work on Players under 39?</b></a><br>One of the limiting factors on what spells could do before was based upon what it would do if used as a twinking mechanism. The level 49 spells put us right up against this ceiling. When we created the new buffs, we decided to put the cut-off. You can still use your level 49 series on people a ways below you in level.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038172.html"><b>Earth Elemental Damage Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: WHY does my level 41 EARTH Elemental HIT HARDER then my level 43 ONE?]</i><P>It's not a bug. There's more to the "power" of a pet than how hard it hits.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038342.html"><b>Play Nice Rules</b></a><br>There are a number of reasons why someone might choose not to group, and we certainly can't compel anyone to join one. For instance, perhaps this guy doesn't like Dark Elves? If he had been a high elf enchanter, perhaps the claim would make more sense, but it is nonetheless valid. There's also the possibility that you and he had some history making him unwilling to group. <P>In any case, it would not be reasonable for us to force people to group with other specific people, especially in the case of a 2 giant spawn, where the ability to split off and take your own spawn is just as viable. </UL>

Another new review of <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/reviews/rok_a.shtm">The Ruins of Kunark</a> was posted at GameSpy.  The final verdict is a 86/100 score.  Here's a clip:<UL>I have been playing EverQuest since Beta4 of last year and I haven't been this excited about anything Verant has done since they lowered the amount of experience you lose when you die. It will take players many weeks of gameplay to fully explore all of the twenty new zones, and the new race adds more color to an already rich world. The Ruins of Kunark is already fueling the fire of addictiveness that EverQuest started a year ago. The expansion was well-timed: Many players that left that game are returning to join their friends and investigate the new graphics and new areas. </UL>

PC.IGN has kicked up their own <a href="http://pc.ign.com/reviews/13953.html">review of Kunark</a> giving it a 8.5 out of 10.  Here's what reviewer Jeremey Conrad had to say:<UL>Since players can now exceed the previous level 50 limit, most of the new zones reflect that, and it is one of the things that hurts this expansion. As I mentioned before, while there are areas for characters of every level to hunt, its not very fun to have to run through an extremely hostile high level zone just to get there. People who start an Iksar won&#8217;t have this problem, as they start out near the lower level zones, but anyone else who is under level 20 will want to avoid Kunark until they are strong enough to survive the journey there. </UL>To read the complete review use the link provided above.<br><br>Thanks MadWand! :)

He told me he was Hocir, the Historian of Freeport.  As he was wandering the underground sewers of Freeport he sensed a dark lurking being there and after further investigation had learned much of the captor of Nyplid, although he was unable to locate Nyplid he does have a great deal of information that may prove beneficial to all on the quest for Nyplid&#8217;s return.

The next place to <a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/Reviews/Item/0,6,0-4078,00.html">review Kunark</a> is GameCenter.  In their review they award Kunark a 9 out of 10 rating, not bad if I say so myself.  Here's the traditional clip from the review:<UL><I>There are some issues with Kunark, however. The higher polygon count causes some lag problems in the new city of Fironia Vie. This lag is related to the CPU, video card, and the amount of RAM you have, and is not an Internet issue. Although the box lists 64MB of RAM as a minimum requirement, 128MB is a more realistic figure. The expansion was also released with some sound problems and noises are sometimes mismatched with some creatures. For instance, if you kill a saber-toothed tiger, it will sound like a human as it dies. Finally, the game could use some proofreading, as in-game text contains many spelling errors and typos ("Agressor [sic] Goblins"?). </I></UL>
