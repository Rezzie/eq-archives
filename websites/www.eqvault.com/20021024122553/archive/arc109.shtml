Here is an excerpt from this tale:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>Brim decided to ready himself and checked his spell book for the right illusion. He found the one he was looking for and mouthed the words once to make sure he had them right. He then closed the book and chanted in the arcane language of power and enchantments. A green nimbus surrounded his hands and crept up his arms. Slowly, the light flowed over his shoulders and down his chest cavity. It finished surrounding him and ended off with a bright green pop, and Brim suddenly felt&#8230; different.<br><br>Izzi stood and looked at the form Brim had taken, and nodded at his choice. Jarnvid swung his big head around and his eyes narrowed slightly, almost as if he could just see through the illusion, but not quite. Brim surveyed himself and could see the form of the Earth Elemental looked satisfactory. He also felt the form&#8217;s added strength, and welcomed it for the upcoming battle.</i></BLOCKQUOTE>Enjoy!

The definition of nerfing was defined by Gordon Wrinn in a recent response he posted regarding some expansion pet issues.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/046347.html">the post</a>:<UL><I>Nerfing?<br><br>My understanding is that the generally accepted definition for a nerf is "changing something in game after initial implementation in a manner that the players generally view as negative".<br><br>Pets past 50 are more powerful than the 49th pets, perhaps not so much in the max-damage/hit or hitpoints, but they are higher level and have better combat skills. They are overall more powerful, and haven't been made less powerful since implementation, so there was no nerf.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon Wrinn, Verant's Internet Relations Manager, recently responded to another player-made post on the Gameplay Board.

Many many people on Tunare are leaving, people that have been there for a long time, and they have no intention of coming back.

Gordon briefly addressed the level 50+ experience issue again on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/046329.html">original post</a> followed by Gordon's response:<UL>A when i was lvl 50(gnome mage) and died i lost exactly half a bubble this could be reclaimed in about 20 kills of blues (solo)<br>Now im lvl 54 it has taken me about 2 weeks and 100's and 100's of kills, i play alot , anyways yesterday i pull a mob and on way back to fight area i got booted to windows from sound bug. When i finally disable sound card and get back in i see ive lost a full half a bubble. How is this equal to "lvl 50 warrior death loss" ?? , well its not even close abashi, if i didnt get a rez i would have been out some 30-40 hours play time. The experience loss of a lvl 50 warrior death would be approx ONE pixel in lvl 54 , could you please reveiw your statement and ammend with some honesty please abashi?<br><br><b><i>I don't have my post log here right now, but I believe I said "low 50s warrior", not "level 50 warrior".<br> <br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon responded to a post stating that Kunark is not for the casual gamer.  Here's the argument followed by Gordon's response:<UL>Kunark sucks for casual gamers  NO chance of getting lvls  NO chance of getting Spells<br><br><b><i>Kunark dungeons generally give more experience than dungeons in the main land. We've also implemented the ability to get *good* loot randomly, eliminating the perceived need to "camp" for items. <br><br>Both of these issues point to Kunark being better for the casual gamer.<br><br>Now, assuming your statement is about levels 51+, experience is slow for everyone there, and spells drop slowly and randomly, meaning that someone who fights in a dungeon 2 hours per day has just as much of a chance of getting a spell as a guy who plays 12 hours per day does in that 2 hour period. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>This post was spotted on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/046315.html">this thread</a> on the Gameplay Board.

From Shaka:<BLOCKQUOTE>Brand New EQ Items Database - Java Applet - Over 1000 Items!!!<br><br>Well, after about a week of working on it, I present to you my new EQ Items<br>Java applet.  There are a few things you must take into consideration before<br>it will work correctly.<br><br>You need the latest version (v1.3) of the Java plug-in for your browser to<br>be able to run my applet.  Upon attempting to run my applet for the first<br>time, it should point you in the right direction to download the plug-in.<br>Yes, I know this takes a bit, but I think it's worth it.<br><br>Secondly, the applet is currently optimized for a screen resolution of<br>1024x768.  Some portions of the applet are cut-off if you run it in 800x600,<br>and I wouldn't even attempt to use 640x480.  I will be optimizing the applet<br>so it runs fine in 800x600, but that hasn't been done yet.<br><br>An extremely important point to keep in mind is that the current version of<br>my applet is a BETA version.  There are bugs, and probably quite a few of<br>them. Please send every bug you find, or suggestions of any sort, to me.  My<br>email address is hawleycj@jmu.edu.  I would greatly appreciate help with<br>this, as it will help increase the applet's quality and ease of use.<br><br>Again, the more help I get from you all, the better this will become.<br>Without further adeiu (sp?), here's the address of my applet.<br><br><a href="http://sys12.cs.jmu.edu/hawleycj/eqitems/">http://sys12.cs.jmu.edu/hawleycj/eqitems/</a><br><br>Please check it out.  I really want this to help as many EQ players as<br>possible, because I know I've been wanting a centralized and well made EQ<br>item database for a long time.<br><br>Thanks guys!<br>Chris (Shaka)</BLOCKQUOTE>

Richardo is back and has the following news to share with the community:<BLOCKQUOTE>I'm finally through the surgery!  <br><br>It was much needed because my tonsils were rotten from the inside-out.  Had a few complications that made the experience a nightmare but I'm home now and ready to play some EQ to get my mind off this pain LOL! =)  Anyway, before I went under, I was able to release two new songs.  <br><br>One is a general comedy song called "Ode to the Hospital" and the other is a serious Everquest love song called "Norrathian Sky."  I particularly hold a special place for "Norrathian Sky" because it speaks so well about the in-game romantic relationships that have developed (role-played of course hehehe ).  <br><br>Unlike the other comedy songs I have released, this is a intricately structured song and is meant to be a ballad.  So please take a listen and post on them if you can.  =)   I will be unable to sing for approximately 2-3 weeks so enjoy these two new works in my leave <br>of absence.  One thing is for sure though, there will be LOTS OF EQ playing  during my recovery.  Heheehheehe  ;)  <br><br>It's just amazing the response I've gotten on these songs...  All of the 3 previous EQ songs have topped the charts at the #1 spot!  Hope this 4th one will do the same! :)~ Just think, it all started with a rainy day when the servers were down and I picked up the guitar!  <br><br>To my fans:<br><br>Thanks for all of your support.  It's crazy to wake up in the morning to see my mailbox filled with all sorts of positive comments but I enjoy hearing from all of you!  Forgive me with I don't answer all of them because there's ALOT of it.  I do read all of them though and appreciate the kind words! :)  <br><br>I'm recovering nicely from surgery now and I promise that when I recover from my surgery, I'll continue to write more music and finish the CD this summer.  See you in game and enjoy the music!  /smile  /bow  /em takes a percocet   "Richardo feels better"<br><br>Your friend, the happy tonsil-less Pally,<br>   Richardo Xavier aka Richie Truxillo<br><A HREF="http://www.mp3.com/richlove">http://www.mp3.com/richlove</A> </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Richardo and get feeling better! :)

Here's all the latest from Gordon Wrinn on the official EQ Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045989.html"><b>Final Fix to Overcrowding?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The FINAL fix to overcrowding, soloing, aggroing greens, and all other problems!  Make greens give experience.]</i><br> <br>Soloability in its current state is as intended. The classes who were designed to solo can do so efficiently. Some other classes have developed strategies that allow them to solo under certain circumstances, but not as efficiently. Finally, most if not all of the classes have the ability to kill an occasional experience-giving critter, but not to the extent that they could really say that they are "soloing". <br><br>My point here is that since soloability isn't broken, giving every class the ability to go "soloing" (Meaning efficiently killing creatures for the purpose of advancement) really wouldn't fix anything. <br><br>Finally, we really don't want to encourage people to bottomfeed (killing things much lower level than you, thus denying the people who should *really* be killing those things the experience of doing so). Bottomfeeding is a fairly present problem these days, to the extent that we've actually considered making it so that things that don't give experience won't give loot either.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045986.html"><b>NPCs</b></a><br>I have to go with Xvarious here. NPCs finish their casting cycle and only then turn around to flee. It has to do with the way NPCs process commands. They have a list of commands they execute, and only certain things can interrupt that list. In casting, the only thing is a bash. Even death causes them to finish their spell as I recall :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045936.html"><b>AE Spells on PvP</b></a><br>Though this explanation doesn't apply to RZ, on the Teams servers, it is an incentive to group within your own team. By choosing to group outside your team, those spells become less effective. <br><br>I will however chat with the team on Monday about it. As I recall, of the 3 types of AE spells, one of them (radiate out from caster) doesn't affect group members. The other two (radiate out from target, and rain spells) do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045957.html"><b>Signs EQ is Rotting Your Brain</b></a><br>I've a couple: <br><br>1. I was intently concentrating while playing the game one night, when my wife came over, gave me a kiss, and told me that she was going to the store. I asked her if she'd pick up a couple of stacks of jasper while she was there. <br><br>2. My wife would take insane joy in talking to me while I was playing EQ (again concentrating like mentioned above). On more than one occasion, I responded in /gsay to things that she said. My group thought I was losing my mind... If they only knew :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045971.html"><b>Even More Monk Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why can Monks get weapons that are stronger than their fists?]</i> <br><br>Simply, because if we provided monks weapons that were not as good as their fists, there wouldn't be a point to them. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Correct me if I'm mistaken, but I thought the idea of a monk is that they fight best with their fists, not with a weapon. This basically makes monks blunt-wielding warriors that hit harder and can't take as many hits.. Variety is a good thing, and the more the better.]</i> <br><br>Monks do wield a considerable amount of power with their fists, giving them an advantage over all of the melee classes when naked. The difference in power between the fists and the weapons is not so great that a monk would be at a *huge* disadvantage by choosing to shun weapons. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why don't Monks get any more damage upgrade on their fists post 50? I hear they're 14/30 at 50, and 14/28 at 60.]</i> <br><br>Though the weapon damage on the fist does not go up, they do get better damage tables, thus yeilding more damage. In other words, a level 60 monk will still hit harder than a level 50 monk.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045915.html"><b>3 Million a Day for Verant</b></a><br>Though I do recogize that this is a humorous post, it is strangly in line with some serious suggestions that I heard a few weeks ago. <br><br>At E3, I was asked a number of times by other game developers why we don't do something along these lines. Some suggested that we should sell the ability to level faster, others suggested that we should sell items and characters. <br><br>Though we could certainly make more money doing something along these lines, we really don't feel that doing something of this nature would be fair or good for the game. We feel that people should be able to expect similar rewards for similar time invested and similar risk taken. Doing something along these lines would just reduce the only deciding factor to those with a bigger wallet.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045766.html"><b>More Monk Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Shiverback has way better AC than cured silk. ;P But it's not quite as good as other non planar armor, which is the problem.]</i> <br><br>By the way, someone a post a few months ago outlining each piece of shiverback and comparing it to a piece of non-planar monk wearable armor that was preferable in most cases. I sent it to myself in an email so that I could hang onto it. <br><br>I'm having trouble finding that email. Can anyone send me that? Please be concise. The EQLive team was looking for it as well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045732.html"><b>More Level 50+ Spell Droppings</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: From having played the first 50 levels where spells were always available, we all assumed that every caster of a certain level is supposed to have all their spells. To a caster, spells are what gear is to a meleer. To have the best spells readily available is like having all the best melee items in the game available on vendors.]</i> <br><br>That's a good point Utay. Players have always viewed spells as "entitlements", espicially wis-casters who didn't have to worry about research. We're trying something different here. My character was 43rd level before he got his 39th pet. This situation really isn't that much different. <br><br>Players can generally survive and advance using a combination of their 49th level spells and the spells that are purchasable if need be. Finding a spell will just make it that much easier, in the same fashion that a melee character doesn't have to have the absolute best weapon in existance in order to be effective.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045648.html"><b>Monks</b></a><br>Monks are supposed to do more melee damage than warriors, which is why monk weapons are better than warrior weapons. If a warrior can suddenly do the damage of a monk, while having a LOT more hitpoints, a warrior would be preferential in a group in all cases. The compelling reason to have a monk would be missing. <br><br>This is the reason that the staff was overpowered for warriors.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044395.html"><b>Walking Sleep - Turgur's Insects </b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I didn't see anything in the patch message that said this was fixed. Verant could we please have an update!?!?]</i><br> <br>This hasn't been fixed yet. We'll definitely let you know when we've made some progress on it. In the mean time, I'd recommend that people don't use this weapon when there's someone in the group that can cast a better attack speed debuff.</UL>

Gordon posted a friendly reminder concerning Verant's policy toward 3rd party programs on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/046001.html">first post in this thread</a>:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>This is just a friendly reminder that using 3rd party programs that somehow provide you an in-game advantage over those that do not use them is not allowed per your license agreement. <br><br>In light of news of some new programs of this type coming on the market, we just wanted to let you know that we will vigorously investigate these issues as they come to our attention. Anyone found to be using such a program (macro programs, packet sniffers, etc.) will be immediately and permanently banned from EverQuest.<br><br>Please, let's play fair.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>Here's the second post in this thread:<UL>You guys spend so much ****ing time eliminating ANYTHING that makes the game less tedious, and yet it is so INCREDIBLY difficult to get any positive change affected. I am not talking about showEQers or ppl using macros, or things like that. I am quite sure 99% of your customers would like this to be a cheat free game, myself included. I am talking about spending time fixing zone teleports that save 5 mins off a one way trip thru a zone vs spending time fixing bugs that drop you for 10K damage. Or how you will 'adjust' nice xp guards/NPCs/raptors, before you will fix spell drops or low xp mob issues.<br><br><b><I>A common misconception is that the GMs are developers or game designers. Except for a small number of them that are apprenticing in the development department, this isn't the case. Therefore, when we announce that the customer service department will be doing something, it doesn't interfere with what the development department is doing. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the third:<UL>If you are going to be scanning computers, particularly mine, I would like to know about it beforehand. <br><br><b><i>Don't worry, per posts by John Smedley a couple of months ago on this issue, we won't be doing anything intrusive.</b></i></UL>Here's the fourth:<UL>I want a yes/no answer. I play a bard. I use a macro program to make song twisting easier. <br><br>This is mainly for downtime in groups (during fighting normally <br>requires a very active twist). I am never away from my computer while using this macro. <br><br>Are you going to ban me?<br><br><b><i>If we catch you, yes. </b></i><br><br>If macro programs are illegal, does that also include setting up a joystick (MS sidewinder is a popular one) on turbo and leaving it on overnight to raise a skill like sense heading, mend, instill doubt, etc. ?<br><br><b><i>Yes, this is included in the definition of a 3rd party program.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the fifth:<UL>Is a program like roger wilco (a way to talk to friends over the inet while playing a game) considered a cheat program? I hope not, because i use my PHONE to talk to my friends, or is that considered an unfair advantage as well?? Can i be banned for using AT&T???<br><br><b><I>No, Roger Wilco is not included in the definition. It does not interact with the EQClient, nor does it provide an advantage (beyond what a phone could do), so we don't have a problem with it.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

This covers all the important skills and trades that anybody new to the EQ world should know before entering Norrath.  It discusses such vital things as how to create an authentic Wood Elf Druid name, EQ socials (the most important one being to shout "DING!" every time you level), how to expertly complain about lag, and a detailed combat guide.

From Chris:<blockquote>GroupExp v 1.0 - 25 May 2000<br>----------------------------<br><br>This is the first "production" release. I think the majority of the kinks<br>are now worked out.<br><br>Improvements and Fixes:<br>1. All valid Race/Class combinations should now be properly recognized.<br>2. Default action for the <Enter> key is now Calculate, vice Exit.<br>3. Kills remaining to Level is now adjusted for % Level Complete (e.g. if<br>   you are two bubs into level 30, and need X experience, your experience <br>   remaining reflects the fact that you are about 40% thru the level).<br>4. GroupExp now re-calculates all numbers each time you make changes to <br>   group composition (you no longer have to make all your changes, then hit<br>   the Calculate button).<br>5. Added the ability to view Current xp, Next Level xp, and xp Remaining for <br>   each player in the group.<br>6. Added Labels at the top to make the interface more clear.<br>7. Added the ability to minimize the window if desired.<br><br>Known Issues:<br>1. GroupExp does not enforce level restrictions (i.e., you can group with <br>   anybody, and anything you kill will give you experience). I may fix this<br>   at a later date, but I am fairly certain the players know who they can<br>   group with, and what they can kill. =)<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Chris<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/GroupExp/">http://www.geocities.com/GroupExp/</a></blockquote>Thanks!

Here are the latest posts made by Verant's Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045608.html"><b>Blade of Passage Nerfed</b></a><br>That one was changed in the last item patch. Due to the number of changes that were made, I only announced the cases where a change would result in a non-negligible change in power for a player. Items that players could carry, but that they didn't have any skill in, were announced in a blanket statement rather than being mentioned specifically.<br><br><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045610.html"><b>Verant at e3</b></a><br>Hey, thanks for posting this. Over all, the whole EQ team had a great time at the show. It's really nice to get out there amongst your peers and chat about each other's games. In many booths that I walked in to (including booths for some future competitors with games in development), I was greeted with, "We're all die-hard EQ players here!" It's definitely a nice compliment. <br><br><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045621.html"><b>Dragon Loot</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: However, when the dragon is slayed, it must actually drop some loot!!! I mean something like 5000pp, a few spells or spell components, some armor (3-4pieces), weapons (3-4), a scale or two, some rare gems (1-2), and perhaps a few quest items (Paly books or others), and some random items like a head, torso, sachels, potions, or food items.]</i> <br><br>The loot the dragons drop is sufficient for their difficulty. Platinum-wise, we don't want dragons to become a bank that would bring 10K more in platinum into the game. Item-wise, it is true that they don't drop something for everyone in the party, but they really shouldn't. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: I was wondering if anyone at verant has ever considered making the dragon spawns at random. IE, Vox, Naggy and the various other dragons in Norrath would never be up at the same time, and you would not know after killing one which one would be up next or when it would be up (Stagger the next spawn between a few minutes to a few hours).]</i><br><br>Though they do spawn immediately when the servers are brought up, subsequent spawns have a random component that keeps them from coming back at a predictable time, even if they are both killed at the same time. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: With this kind of loot everyone would walk away with something]</i><br> <br>That's not really what we were going for. They aren't supposed to be the equivalent of taking out an armored car.<br><br><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045600.html"><b>More Boards</b></a><br>I am looking at getting up 2 or 3 more message boards in the near future providing that some technical specifics can be resolved in the near future. <br><br>One board, which we'll call something along the lines of "The Vision" (heh), will be for us to post our stance on persistent issues that keep coming up (Melee bind for instance). Another board (Announcements) will be for transient issues (Such as Quest X being repaired). Both boards would allow new threads only from official types like myself, Brad, Smed. The announcements board would allow replies from anyone. <br><br>Both boards would direct people to a general discussion board for debate purposes. <br><br>As far as creating another board for Venting, I suspect that it wouldn't work as envisioned. Since most people venting want to be sure that we are aware of their issues, they tend to post whereever it appears that read the most. That's why gameplay has become more of a general discussion forum than anything else.<br> <br>I have considered putting strong moderation in place on these boards, deleting flames, personal attacks, and messages with profanity. That might be a better method of promoting good debate here on the boards.<br><br><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045622.html"><b>Concordance of Research Patch</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: First, let me say Gordon is a GAWD. He walks on water and all that he pronounces is, and should be, the law of the land!]</i> <br><br>Well in that case, I might take a crack at this post :)<br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Can you tell me if this means that the "missing" components now drop off of those things that would logically drop them or the receipes have been changed to reflect items tht have always been dropped in the past?]</i> <br><br>The former. The recipies remain the same, but the missing components now drop. Also, one recipe required fine steel or blunt weapons, and one weapon (FS Great staff) wasn't working. That was fixed as well.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045624.html"><b>Naming Your Pet</b></a><br>We've ruled out allowing this due to the excessive customer-service impact of opening up another name assignment that would have to go through an approval process. We have two situations like this at present (first and last name), which is as difficult as we want to make it at present.<br><br><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045625.html"><b>Spell Effects on Armor Items</b></a><br>The spell effects on those armor items aren't unbalancing. To my knowledge, there isn't a spell effect greater than level 16 on any of the activatable (right-click to activate) items. All of them should require that the piece be worn to activate the effect, and all should have casting times double to quadruple that of the actual spell.<br><br><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045638.html"><b>Corpse Loss</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I'm sorry, the difficulty of corpse recovery should have *nothing* to do with the (in)efficiency of the server code. It should have to do with Vox sitting on your corpse's chest.]</i><br> <br>As an engine programmer, I'm sure that you are aware that any difficulty in retrieving corpses from areas with tons of corpses is caused by framerate from having to draw the corpses, not anything to do with server code. <br><br>This problem can be reduced by turning the clipping plane all the way down, turning off the sky and particle effects. <br><i>[Quote from original post: Address the real issue.]</i><br> <br>Can you concisely state what you believe the "real issue" to be? It's a fairly common occurance here that I'm accusing of not getting the point, or avoiding the "real issue". I do think that part of this is due to the fact that the "real issue" is often subjective in nature. <br>---------<br>Just a follow up here. I have spoken to the client programmer about the possibility of implementing a switch that would suppress the display of corpses for cases such as this. He's looking into the issue now, as it would probably be a worthwhile feature addition.<br><br><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045526.html"><b>The Customer is Not Always Right</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: i called the tech support line and didnt even get my problem solved and the next month when the bill came in... $ 13.00 dollar bill.....now that does NOT make any sense....]</i> <br><br>I assume by this you mean the phone bill, since we don't charge for technical support. It is the phone company that is charging you for calling the line, not us. It's not uncommon these days for technical support to be given via a toll number. We want to retain your business, and as such we provide a phone line for you to call if you need support to get EQ running on your system. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: What happend to the customer is always right?]</i> <br><br>On a broad scale, the customer in this case is nearly 250K people, all of whom have differing desires and expectations, which are often in direct conflict with the desires and expectations of another customer. For example, if one customer says, "He ninjalooted", and the other says, "No, he ninjalooted", which customer is "right" in this case? <br><br>"The Customer is always right" is a business philosophy that works well in situations where the service rendered to one customer does not affect the service that will be given to the next. The fast-food analogy in this thread (that I've been guilty of using before) doesn't apply because one customer ordering "extra pickles" will not cause all future orders to contain "extra pickles". What I mean is that in that analogy, the service organization can fulfill the needs of each individual customer impacting the next customer in line. <br><br>What the customers *are* entitled to is courtesy, respect, and fair treatment, even when their specific needs cannot be fulfilled. <br><br>That said, if you (gemini453) have any specific customer-service issues that haven't been resolved, I'll be happy to discuss them further here or pass them on to someone else if it is an issue that I cannot address. Please don't just say "you care so little about your customer satifaction" and not give us any guidance into how to improve our service.<br><br><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043691.html"><b>Resists Higher</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Is it me or do the resists seem higher after this last patch   It sure seems like im getting resisted even more now . On three seperate occassions today i had strings of 5 or 6 spell fully resisted two of these instances were blue pickclaw mobs in HighKeep note i was using magic , fire and ice based spells.]</i><br> <br>No changes of this type have been made. This comes up every patch day. Just to be fair, I promise that any blanket changes to how resists or fizzles work will be announced.</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
The following is the latest message to be displayed on the EverQuest Patch Server:<UL>May 25th, 8:00am<br>--------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Greetings all! The following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<br><br>*Spells/Songs*<br><br>- Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage spell was improperly saving versus resistance to cold. It now appropriately saves versus magic.<br>- The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly healing the target instead of damaging it. This has been corrected.<br><br>*Items*<br><br>The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge armor, has had its weight decreased substantially.<br><br>The Runed Fighter's Staff, previously useable by Monks and Warriors, has been restricted to Monks only. The statistics on this staff are much more powerful than normally allowed for warriors. This change is retroactive and will be reflected on items currently in inventory. Though we strive to avoid negatively adjusting items after they have been earned, this item presented a balance issue, making the change necessary. We apologize to warriors that currently own this weapon.<br><br>A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to report "Item out of charges", has been corrected. Due to the dynamics of this particular issue, current owners will need to contact a GM to trade this item out for a new, properly working version of the item.<br><br>The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced. In addition to an increase in statistics, it received a stronger spell effect. The lightsource effect on the weapon has been removed due to an aesthetic rogue desire to be "sneaky" :)<br><br>The effect on the Hangman's Noose will now work properly.<br><br>*General Changes*<br><br>- Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful for their level. They have been adjusted.<br>- Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep. NPCs and pets should have a much easier time of navigating the zone.<br>- Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe Mountains. These issues have been corrected.<br>- A handful of problems reported with research practice via the Concordance of Research have been corrected. All practice-rune recipes should now work correctly.<br>- Gorilla's in Burning Wood now have a new texture set that properly reflects their undead status.<br>- Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.<br>- /yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing the yell.<br>- Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression that they were allowed to start their character in Cabalis. They were never actually allowed to create the character there, however the indication that they could has been fixed.<br>- Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes to the desktop in certain cases.<br><br>We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) for zones in which music does not currently work. There are 55 small files (around 2K each) that will be patched over the next couple of days to enable music in all of the affected zones. <br><br>The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized. Certain aspects of the changes have made certain areas of the zone more dangerous, but the reward should be well worth the risk. Feel free to visit this zone and search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These changes went in on Monday.<br><br>Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the amount of experience being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons). The affected zones have been updated, and adventurers should notice the greater experience reward in return for the increased risk and challenge associated with these zones.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Uglar sends the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings all.<br><br>      While roaming through Field of Bone today I happened accross a<br>vile creature named The Tangrin.  I saw this creature from a far and he<br>seemed harmless enough.  Upon closer look I relized that this happy<br>monkee type creature was a little less than happy to see me, he suddenly<br>raised his paws in anger at me, showing me that he could swipe me down<br>with little effort on his part.<br><br>      I now realize the pain this creature must have cause many a<br>traveler and I set forth to rid the lands of this evil vile being.  I<br>brought in backup to assist in the second attempt at slaying.  With me<br>and Zaknafain raising our swords high with honor we struck hard at this<br>beast, Starweaver and Velven using their mojo struck hard and with<br>vengance in their hearts.  The beast struck back HARD slaying sheading<br>first blood on me, then shortly there after slaying the mighty<br>Zaknafain.<br><br>      After Rokglo used her special talent to resurrect us we decided<br>that we needed to call in the troops.  The Tangrin was a bigger opponent<br>than we had first thought.<br><br>    With the help of my wife Carressa, and many many others from the<br>Dead on Arrival clan we were able to destroy the beast with great honor<br>and vengance.  It was a bloody battle but in the end we were the<br>victorious ones and payback was served.  I give props to Tangrin, as he<br>was a worthy opponent and his bloodshed brought many a smile to the<br>faces of the residents of Cabilis.<br><br>/ooc - The Tangrin was an AWESOME battle.  Took upwards of 30+ people to<br>finally take this beast down.  Tangrin is a lvl 54 Monkee who resides on<br>the isle in the Field of Bone.  The battle was fought by the members of<br>DoA and friends.  Loot on The Tangrin, well unfortuately it seems Verant<br>forgot to stock this creature with any goods to be passed out to the<br>brave folk that slayed this creature.  Many a thanks to the people that<br>came from a far to help take this beast down - it was a great battle!<br><br>Uglar Ba'shdemgud<br>Troll Warrior of the Fatty Kind<br>Dead On Arrival<br>Tarew Marr Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Uglar!

There are a few more posts Gordon posts made late last night and early this morning on the Gameplay Board to report.  Here they are:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045284.html"><b>The Quest in EverQuest</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I know, I know. Wizards are catagorized as "Low Priority" at Verant but there's a quest that has been broken since ROK went live. <br><br>It's called the BRAIN BITE QUEST. Heard of it? Probably not unless you're a wizard dying to get a spell that just might add some balance to the class. <br><br>I wouldn't bother bringing it up since Verant has a very strict "see no evil, hear no evil" policy towards wizards, but this *is* a QUEST. <br><br>Could you fix it please?]</i><br><br>Is this the one with the NPC that spawns in an invalid location in a particular zone? That's being fixed in the patch tomorrow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045289.html"><b>Disciplines in Spellslots</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: It would be great to place the disciplines in spellslots as i just dont have any more room in my hotkeys or in my socials either. The slots are currenttly not used and the disciplines would be easier accesible as well as you would always be aware of the discipline status. (highlight the active discipline black all others grey and inactive disciplines grey until you can use the again, for example)]</i><br><br>Though we really don't have a problem with the idea from a philosophical standpoint, the interface doesn't currently allow this, or even anything close to this that could feasibly be implemented in a reasonable amount of time. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/000019.html"><b>Cannabilize II Update</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why haven't you gotten back to us like promised Abashi?]</i> <br><br>Because I was just able to get the info today. There will be a quest going in the next time we patch data that will allow Shaman's to obtain this spell.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045281.html"><b>Race War Server Mishap</b></a><br>There is a faction penalty for killing players on the racewar servers. Though I'm sorry that you are inconvenienced, it falls upon the players to learn the dynamics of how things work on the PvP servers.</UL>

From Dragons:<BLOCKQUOTE>The gaming industry has grown alot in the past years.  Its advanced from<br>text based muds to basic graphical games to the complex, indepth games<br>of the near future.  Despite all these advances, there are still alot of<br>fundamental problems with the games that concern all players yet dont<br>seem to get addressed by gaming companies.  <br><br>To help combat that problem, a new web site has been launched today<br>named Faustian Rants.  After 12 years of online gaming Faust has had a<br>great deal of experience involving Large Guild's, Game Design, PvP and<br>the politics of the industry.  Long ago he ran the Pagan Magic Research<br>team which was a popular item regarding  Ultima Online.  Within that web<br>site he used to include his rants and they  were always quite popular. <br>He now see's himself fit to rant and rave about  topics such as<br>EverQuest, Shadowbane, Ultima Online, and the Industry as a whole. <br>After his recent visit to E3 he's got some Scoop on these topics as<br>well!!<br><br>Check out Faustian Rants at <a href="http://www.llts.org/faust">http://www.llts.org/faust</a></BLOCKQUOTE>
