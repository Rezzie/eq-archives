<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon was back in full swing on the Gameplay Board today.  Here's the lowdown on all his latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056573.html"><b>"My Sky Quest items are gone!"</b></a><br>Though I'm not aware of any specific quests that have been changed up there, there is an ongoing plan to revisit the stats on the quest items, which may very well lead to the quests themselves being revamped. If a quest has been changed, it's very likely that items that were components for those quests might be removed or replaced with new items. In these cases, the items removed are probably ancillary in nature.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056585.html"><b>Keep Ralloz Zek Item Lootable</b></a><br>We indeed plan to keep Rallos Zek as it is for the foreseeable future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056637.html"><b>Verant's Customers</b></a><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I have read interviews where Verant thinks its customers are satisfied with the level of service they receive along with the quality of product they purchase on a monthy basis. ]</i></font><br><br>Generally, yes, I would agree that most people are satisfied by virtue of the fact that they continue to be customers and continue to recommend EQ to their friends. In addition, the last poll we conducted on the subject actually surprised us with how many individual people expressed satisfaction when given a specific intent to express otherwise. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: My question to you Verant is this, Why then do some many people flame Verant on this board?]</i></font> <br><br>Human psychology. People are more likely to get worked up and post about something that upsets them than they are about something that pleases them. People who are happy with the game are often too busy playing it to come here to the boards. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I can hardly find a nice thing being said about EQ or Verant. ]</i></font><br><br>Those posts are here, but the way the thread system works has the most controversial issues constantly being moved to the front page. Go back about 50 pages and see how many positive posts you see. <br><br>Also, check out other sites that we (Brad and I) do not post to regularly. You actually get some good discussions going on about various issues with very few of the flames that are popular here. I frequently go out and read these other boards to "get my bearings" when I get the feeling that what is so often portrayed here is the norm. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Here is my take on the problem. First off, you are using the stick to motivate players. Nerfs, EXP. losses post 50, slow EXP climbs and lack of bug fixes, customer support, etc.]</i></font> <br><br>Given the choice of only the "stick" or the "carrot", as your title mentions, I would say that we actually provide more carrot than stick. There is always more to do in EverQuest. More items to get, new spells to learn, new quests to complete, and other classes that haven't been played. We provide so much stuff to do that no one will ever experience all of the diversity that EverQuest has to offer. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: At level 50+ you camp EXP. Thats right, sit down and kill/kill/kill just to see your exp bar move a pixel]</i></font> <br><br>I'm a little dismayed that people continue to do this. Prior to levels above 50 being attainable, people did not "camp EXP" at level 50. They were happy to have fun and play the game at level 50 with the general understanding that they would never advance. All of a sudden we open up levels above 50, and everyone goes in XP camp mode. Why? There's no point to it. If they just played the game the same way that they were playing it once they reached 50, they would find themselves advancing. <br><br>I guess that it's the mindset that the "carrot" in this case encourages. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Nerfs. Why so many for all the wrong reasons? Instead of coding something properly we get unannounced nerfs. Then Verant wonders why people flame them? I don't understand. Throw a cold bucket of water on me while I am sleeping and I can guarantee I will not be a happy person.]</i></font> <br><br>We don't enjoy nerfing anything. Players will always figure out things that we didn't intend. Let's face it, players have far more people "on the job" than we do. We don't enjoy nerfing, and we do enjoy enhancing. However, enhancing or nerfing exclusivly will break the game quickly. Many are fond of quoting this article titled "Mudwimping", which advocates exclusive enhancements. There's a term for that as well that the author doesn't mention: Mudflation. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Verant, I truly think you have a great game. I think it needs alot of work to be one of the all time great games. Remeber to use the carrot and not the stick and I bet your reputation will come back full swing. I also would be willing to bet that me/us will once again truly enjoy a great game. ]</i></font><br><br>Though I didn't agree with some of your assertions, I would like to thank you for taking the time to express your opinions. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056642.html"><b>Login Poll Question</b></a><br>Currently we get just raw results from the polls. We don't store the answers or attach them to user accounts for later reference. I'd personally like to see some more robust demographic info, providing that reasonable guidelines can be established for determining a demographic. I'd really love to be able to cross-reference poll data against things such as /played time, servers played on, etc. <br><br>The downsides to this however might be that doing this would actually skew the results of a poll, as some people might be hesitant to answer in a certain way if they thought we were storing or analyzing responses. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056370.html"><b>Poison Revamp Status</b></a><br>Hopefully this next patch assuming the test department signs off on it. There's still one coding bug that we need to solve before that will happen, but hopefully we can take care of it quicky. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056421.html"><b>Crocodiles & Caimians </b></a><br>People in the high-teens to low 20s go to oasis to clean up on some relatively easy experience that the crocodilians there provide. To contrast the easy singular combat provided by those creatures, there exists the danger of being engaged and killed by some agressive creatures that run through the zone now and again. People fighting there learn that this is part of the risk, and likewise learn to keep an eye out for such things. <br><br>It seems to be working out well overall. Perhaps I'm missing your point.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056492.html"><b>PoH Nerfed?</b></a><br>Sounds like you are just having some bad luck. We haven't touched the Plane of Hate in a couple of months, since the last time that we announced a change with it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056308-2.html"><b>SWO & Zones</b></a><br>Though I really can't comment on any specifics regarding SWO at this time, I would like to clarify that "Zones" does not mean "zones" in the EQ sense from the perspective of "zoning". You can count on SWO embracing the newest technology available in regards to world layout.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056291.html"><b>"Why won't enduring breathe protect me from suffucating spehere?"</b></a><br>Hehe, you have a point. I do wish that we had some more complex spell interactions than what we do in a few instances. I would personally like to see most magic have both positive and negative effects in various proportions. <br><br>That's the nice thing about magic systems, you no longer have to be constrained by the inflexible boundaries of reality.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056336.html"><b>Results of Dragon Poll</b></a><br>I'm not prepared to release the specific informaiton just yet. As our Monday meetings have been postponeed, we need to discuss the data and decide how to proceed, which won't happen until Wednesday of this week. <br><br>I will say that the numbers were in favor of the current arrangement, but not to the extent that we thought they would be. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056341.html"><b>Invalid Account Key Problem</b></a><br>Your account is still valid, you just need to resubscribe via the accounts section of the game login. You don't have to create a "new" account.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056197.html"><b>"PAW Loot Stinks!"</b></a><br>Ok, so you did a dungeon once and didn't get any "phat lewt". The question is, did you have more fun than you do when killing the same critter for hour upon hour?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056212.html"><b>Corpse Decay & the EQ Community</b></a><br>I don't agree with your assertion that you received bad customer support since corpses decay, that's how it works, and it's necessary in order to keep corpses from clogging up every area of the land. <br><br>That said, you've posted a wonderful example of how the player community often chips in to help out someone who's fallen on bad times. Your character must be rather well-known for being the upstanding sort considering all of the support you received from your fellow players. Kudos to you for showing how kindness will be repaid.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056219.html"><b>"A Game is Supposed to be Fun"</b></a><br>Though I realize that this post is rhetorical in nature, I would be intrigued if you could post a definition of "fun" that everyone playing the game can agree upon. The perception of "fun" is entirely subjective, meaning that it is different from each persons point of view. Some things that one person finds "fun" might be seen as "boring" or "frustrating" to another. Some people's idea of "fun" is directly in conflict with other people's ideas. <br><br>It's our job as game designers to try and provide an environment where the greatest number of people possible can have fun. <br><br>We certainly won't be able to please everyone in these regards, nor would we want to. For instance, there are some people in the online world who can only have "fun" if they are allowed to ruin the "fun" of others. We don't aim to cater to that player-type. <br><br>There are many types of "fun" that we provide and allow players the opportunity to take part in, and our subscription numbers show that we must be doing something right.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056196.html"><b>Highest 2Hand Slashing in Game</b></a><br>This is along the same lines as some of the cursed weapons that will be coming in game shortly. Though I can see a bunch of people complaining that the weapons are "useless", I think they will end up a lot of fun :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054790.html"><b>Increased Spell Fizzles?</b></a><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I have noticed lately that the number of spell fizzles that I have been having have increased]</i></font> <br><br>This has been a standard concern posted here to the boards every few weeks since I started at Verant 7 months ago. Just to clarify, we have not made any changes to the way fizzles work in at least that long. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I have also noticed that my skills do not go up as frequently as before. This is most noticeable in my Sense Direction skill.]</i></font> <br><br>Skill-gain begins to work differently once a certain skill-level is surpassed. This is a normal part of leveling up.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056041.html"><b>Fleshy Orb</b></a><br>Our test department checks these boards and have apparently identified the issue. Basically one of the zones that needed to be updated to get this quest working completely didn't get updated in the patch before last. Last week's patch didn't update any zone-data, so we should catch this in the next patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056097.html"><b>Paragraphs, Please</b></a><br>Please, by all means, use paragraphs to seperate differing ideas and thoughts. It makes reading through and addressing your concerns far easier. It's often very difficult to discern the points that are truly important to the author when reading through a BBOT (Big Block of Text). <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056183.html"><b>Test of Flight Logistics Concerns </b></a><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Having a fee of 10 plat for each level of your character may be fine for higher level characters, but it basically excludes any untwinked players below level 30 ish.]</i></font> <br><br>While I understand your concerns, we do need to have some method to limit the number of people entering the contests. By lowering the price and making it more affordable for everyone, the number of people wishing to participate will skyrocket. We then might have to look into limiting the number of people who can particpate, which then will open up an entirely new set of difficulties, such as us having to track who participates from week to week to insure that everyone gets their chance.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056187.html"><b>Race Balance</b></a><br>I've always found these numbers pretty interesting and encouraging. It shows that there is some hope for roleplaying out there after all. It's nice to see that everyone didn't flock to the race perceived to be the most powerful as a rule. </UL>

The <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid962063667,24120,">Reader Responses for <i>The Bottom Line</i></a> article published last week have been posted at <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/lore/shadoe/">Shadoe's Corner</a>.  As you may recall, <i>The Bottom Line</i> dealt with many issues concerning customer support, the Test Server incident and more.  Here's a blurb:<UL><b>Oh yeah, re: "capitalism at iits finest." Capitalism is competition in a free market <br>place. Verant "not caring" is not "capitalism at its finest." Capitalism at its finest <br>would be several companies like Verant competing for the same consumer dollar. <br>The only other kid on the block right now is Ultima Online, which isn't really <br>competiton in the sense that it's not as active a member in the "MMRPG" <br>community anymore. You're talking about a "monopoly." </b><br><br>One... I never said Verant didn't care. On the contrary, I said they do care about their players as a community, <i>questioning</i> whether they cared for them as individuals, or even if they should.<br><br>Two... When did I say Verant not caring would be capitalism at its finest? For those like you who missed it, I'll summarize: It's the freedom of the consumer to cancel his (or her) account that is capitalism at its finest. It's increased competition that will make the bottom line serve the online gamer. I suggest reading that part again, sir, because I simply can't fathom how any other message could come out of those two paragraphs.<br><br>And, no, Verant does not hold a monopoly. The market is just very narrow at the moment. Besides, this is <i>entertainment</i>. People will pay for it so long as it serves their purposes to do so. This being the case, a monopoly in this regard would really be bordering on futility.</UL>  Check it out!

From Catalyst:<BLOCKQUOTE>We've just put up a new issue of <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">Ask Milo</a> here at Everlore. This weeks responses deal with the lack of clothing on some of EQ's female models, bad english skills, suggestions for new models, and many other things discussed. Interesting and entertaining read as always, here's a snip.     <Blockquote><i>    I found it rather interesting that you didn't even bother to comment on the lack of clothing on EverQuest characters. You did             mention that it was in fact a female who pushed for characters to have tight, hard bodies and healthy endowments, but failed to     notice and or comment that it is possible for beautiful people to wear clothing and still be beautiful. I am just a little tired of all the     male teenagers, who obviously have never gotten within ten feet of a real woman, constantly making comments about my             barbarian's *healthy endowment*.<P>     A female barbarian wishing for a really large cloak to hide in.     </blockquote></BLOCKQUOTE></i>

To read this report please <b>highlight</b> the following area with your mouse cursor, it has been blanked out due to possible spoiler content:<BLOCKQUOTE><font color=white>11 bold adventurers consisting of<br><br>Growls, Druid (54)<br>Kenzan, Druid (53)<br>Dykitana, Druid (52) I think<br>Polynices, Enchanter (53)<br>Easier , Rogue (51)<br>Stannis, Paladin (49)<br>Morganfox, Bard (40)<br>Lilyana, Cleric (50)<br>Luvin, Druid (53)<br>and me Saroeb , Wizard (47)<br><br>Ventured into the Hole the day after Patch day. The door is pickable by a rogue<br>and you zone into a small pool of water.<br><br>Upon swimming up you will encounter a corridor which is guarded by 2 elemental<br>warriors. Taking these down was not to tough and there are a few more elementals<br>along the way, occasionally a Rock Golem (which looks like a giant Muddite).<br>Going through a rocky corridor you come to a small courtyard type<br>place which leads up to a small Guardhouse. In the distance you can just see<br>some parapets of a castle.<br><br>Inside the guardhouse was a mob called Gabantik, had a few chuckles about that,<br>and several friends. Rock Golem, Elementals etc.<br><br>We cleared the guardhouse with suprising ease considering the Rock Golems summon<br>you  and have a whole pile of Hitpoints. The elementals we encountered<br>were only of the warrior type. The guardhouse has a door at the back of it which<br>leads out onto a bridge which connects to the top floor of the castle, this was<br>not<br>pickable and said you needed a key. More on this later.<br><br>We decided to venture on. Hugging the left wall we discovered a ramp which led<br>down and down and down and ended in a small drop. This is the point of no return<br>and so we all jumped taking minimal damage. We then proceeded to pull from the<br>side of this huge castle. Looking up we saw the bridge spanning the courtyard<br>area.<br><br>We pulled the first room clear, elementals mainly and a Flighty Fiend or two,<br>which looks like a big Fire Imp.<br><br>The elementals came in many different classes, Elemental Wizard, Bejewelled<br>Elemental (which dropped Loam Sleeves +5 int very nice), Elemental Vizier,<br>and others I cannot remember the names of.<br><br>Proceeding into the castle we made our way onwards and upwards encountering more<br>and more , rock golems, elementals and even some very amusing but<br>painful Rat Warriors hehe.<br><br>We kept on up the castle, even had a GM visit us to congratulate us on getting<br>so high up the castle. We got right to the top of the castle to the<br>aforementioned bridge. This was something of a major achievement in itself as we<br>weren't exactly the most balanced of groups but we were rocking and having a<br>real good time.<br><br>So we get to the bridge, clearing a throne room type area beforehand, thinking<br>we could go across the bridge and out through the Guardhouse again. We cleared<br>the guard house. Incidentally you can't fall off the bridge nor the castle<br>walls, nor can you cast levitate in this dungeon. Tried to open the door from<br>inside the guardhouse that would lead us back to where we started and it<br>wouldn't open. Couldn't be picked either and asked for a key.<br><br>So we figured we'd journey back down the castle again as the way up had been<br>relatively easy.<br><br>We made it down as far as the second floor and then the Castle must of decided<br>it had had enough of us as things came from all over. Basically my group of 6<br>was wiped out before we even had a chance to hit evac, the other 4 managed to<br>evac.<br><br>Figuring we weren't that far in we thought the Corpse Recovery would be<br>relatively easy, and there was another group there with 3 tanks enchanter,<br>healer and druid hunting at the zone so we called on them for some help and<br>assistance. So we started to fight our way in again same as before, and the<br>castle just didn't<br>seem to behave as well as it had on the way up. Things spawned from all over and<br>mauled all the parties.<br><br>In the end it took over 5 hours corpse recovery many high level people lost<br>their lives to rescue our fallen adventurers, and even then we had to get a<br>necromancer,  Tinnel *hugs*, to summon the last 4 corpses.<br><br>In summary, it was a great zone to hunt in, I don't know whether its been<br>programmed that way to lure you in then totally wipe you out. But I have never<br>seen<br>a dungeon change its spawning patterns so quickly and where all the mobs came<br>from god only knows.<br><br>As far as loot was concerned we got some nice items but to be honest it was the<br>thrill of adventure that made it and we all had a blast despite the 5hr CR.<br><br>I think we may possibly be the first to clear the castle and get all the way to<br>the top on our server at least.<br><br>Thanks to all involved in CR.<br><br>And I'll send you some piccies too to show you our ascent all the way later<br>this week when we've sorted through the several hundred we took! :)<br><br>Saroeb Na'Myraen<br>Naked Wizard<br>Quellious Server<br><br>Too many guilds involved to list em all as we're one big happy family  on<br>Quellious *grin*</font></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Saroeb!

Ariel sent us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>This last weekend, Legacy of Steel traveled to the Plane of Air. We fought from island to island, overcoming each obstacle in our path. On Island 4, we defeated the undefeated Overseer of Air. After this, we carefully set foot on Sprioc Island. After one of the most epic battles these eyes have ever seen, LoS was able to clear the Sprioc Guardian and the Spiroc Lord. Island 6 was next. There we encountered the Bzzzzats (huge flying wasps). This was our biggest challenge to date in the guild. The dangerous wasps overcame us several times as we attempted to defeat the boss of the island Bazzzt Zzzt. Bazzzt can hit a person for over 800 points of damage in a single attack and can coat the island entirely in a cloud of disease. After 2 attempts, we were able to overcome her. Battle-worn and weary, we used our keys and stepped upon the Seventh Island&#8230; LoS has now gone where no one has ever gone before. We were amazed by flying drakes and the majestic Sphinx which guards a foreboding temple at the center of the island. With our collective energies sorely depleted, we decided to save the island for the next day&#8230; Now we are one island away from the Hand of Veeshan himself&#8230;<br><br>Ariel<br>55th Level Warrior and<br>GM of Legacy of Steel<br>The Nameless<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa3.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa4.jpg">Screenshot #4</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa5.jpg">Screenshot #5</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa6.jpg">Screenshot #6</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa7.jpg">Screenshot #7</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is with a heavy heart that I report that my beloved, The Lady of the<br>AnDarim, has been ruthlessly kidnapped!

No tracks, no clues, nothing, it is as if she had vanished<br>into thin air.

It is now that I call upon the noble<br>travellers and mercernaries of Qeynos and it's surroundings to come to me<br>and aid me in my search. Those that find her shall be rewarded personally<br>from me, Lord Caleryn.  It is with great hope that i recieve as much help as<br>possible, for I believe that there isn't much time before something horrible<br>happens to my lady, if indeed that hasn't happened already.

Gordon responded to a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055966.html">lengthy post</a> about the Vallon Zek server on the Gameplay Board.  Here is an <i>excerpt</i> from the original post followed by Gordon's response:<UL>There are two purposes to this note: 1) to make a logical argument for keeping Vallon an item-loot server, and 2) to make an emotional one that Vallon is one of the best and most fun servers on EQ. I love my server and I hope that passion comes through. <br><br>There are a number of things that make Vallon special. Many of these will be lost if Vallon becomes a coin-only server. Here they are, in no particular order: <br><br>1) ROLEPLAYING on Vallon is not an optional frill. It arises organically out of the rules. Everyone on the server has definite ideas about cross-teaming and when it's appropriate to Player-Kill (PK). There are guilds that are all-team, all-Light, single-Team, single-Race. There are people who kill anyone not on their team, anyone Dark, anyone Light, anyone Elf. There are solo-PKers whose biggest thrill in life is killing green /cons and use every mean trick in the book, noble PKers who refuse to PK naked or to kill people at low health, and group-PKs who love camping the teleport circles and the banks. And everyone feels so passionately about these issues that they don't even call it role-playing, which naturally makes it the best kind of role-playing there is.<br><br>I'm a Gnome warrior, and I only kill PKers. I spent a few days in Blackburrow the other week, collecting Gnoll teeth to improve my faction with Steel Warriors. When I first got there the Barbarians and Humans there were really rude, attacking me occasionally, inspecting me without asking, shouting for everyone to watch out...a Gnome was in the zone. But while I was there I killed an average of two Dark Elf PKs a day, and before long I'd say /ooc "I can't help with the Shorts, but if you get any Dark PKs, just send me a /tell." And people would shout "All right! Caper's in the zone!", or I'd say /ooc "I have a Senior Apprentice robe I just looted of a PK wizard. I'll give it to the first caster who /pokes me", and they would shout "WTG Caper!" "Woo woo Caper!" It was more fun than I've had in a month of levelling and fighting AI mobs.<br><br>On a Blue server, what can you do that's a truly despicable act? Start a really bad train? And what can anyone do to stop you? Petition a GM? That's noble. Good and Evil become just an affectation. <br><br>2) TWINKING on Vallon is risky. If you're like me, you think twinking is cheating. It wrecks the economy, makes a mockery out of role-playing, and destroys competitiveness. I know I'll never convince many of you about this, but look: there are 2 dozen servers where you can twink to your heart's content. There are only 2 where it's in any way risky. Why can't those of us who hate twinking have our servers, too?<br><br>Once I saw a very low-level halfling warrior in Misty wearing a bronze breastplate. I thought, "That guy's going to be stripped naked inside a half hour." But that BP blinked on and off everytime he heard a noise. Blink orange, blink naked hobbit chest, blink orange. He was spending so much energy keeping the thing that I couldn't resent him for it. And that's the way twinking should be. <br><br>3) PvP TACTICS are difficult to learn and fun. Re-arranging the default keyboard layout and learning to move with the mouse are not affectations, they're necessities. Melees spend as much time collecting PvP gear as PvE gear, and that makes for tremendously exciting stories. "Hiding" on Vallon isn't a push-button skill, it's an art that works regardless of whether or not the other guy has his See Invisible spell up. For instance, a sitting Gnome will just fit inside the belly of an Ogre corpse, and no one can see her, and she can see out at everyone. Train a Young Kodiak to the Nektulous zone and kill it there, and you have a hiding spot that will let you eavesdrop on the glory of the Dark nation as they parade by, and no one will know.<br><br>The most fun I've ever had in EQ was running around LGuk trying to get some NO DROP Shin armors and the Basalt Carapace. I was level 15, chased by Dark Twinks and Shin Ghoul knights. I followed a high-level Dark group through the Bedroom, into the Heart room, to the Gargoyle room, shaking the whole time. I spent 10 days down there and never got a single experience point. But the stories I can tell! <br><br>4) The RISK is so much greater on Vallon, and that makes the game much more exciting. There's so much at stake. The first time you're murdered in cold blood and <br>your best item is looted, you're tramautized. You're shaking and you might feel sick at the stomach. You're probably filled with a futile hatred that some *%&$ wizard 8 levels higher than you are just killed you in two nukes and there's no way you will ever get back at her. Hatred on Vallon isn't artificial, it's real.<br><br>But so is gratitude...normally Elves hate Gnomes like me, so I'll never forget the Wood Elf Druid, a stranger, who saved me from a Ranger PK one day. Once you get a good reputation, those suprise acts of kindness become increasingly common. You make instant friends. And you begin to figure out the PvP tricks...how to hot-key inventory slots for quick bagging, how to move around in combat so you're not caught by surprise.<br><br>I'm a level 18 warrior with 15 days of /played, and with luck and skill I haven't lost an item since level 8. But I know I will again, and I'm ready for that. I'm proud that I'm levelling on the most difficult server there is, and you would be, too. <br><br>5) But the greater CHALLENGE of playing on Vallon varies greatly depending on class. Melees are the hardest, being the most dependent on equipment, and you never want to log on and level for a few hours when you're sleepy. On the other hand, pet classes can level to 50 stark naked, essentially without risk. <br><br>So when I'm in the mood to be challenged, when I'm ready for an adrenaline ride at any moment, then I play my warrior. And when I'm not, I play my mage. My warrior gets 85% of my playing time. <br><br>And Vallon is a team server, so there's always someplace SAFE. When I pull into Rivervale I breathe a sigh of relief. I can go fishing on the docks there in full armor without risk. I don't have to be paranoid all the time. <br><br>6) My favorite thing about Vallon is that it's so much less PREDICTABLE than the Blue servers. People are much more surprising than idiot computer AI MoBs. The game never reduces itself to a stopwatch and a calculator. You never get the feeling that you're just floating around a visually-appealing chatroom. You have so many more STORIES to tell.<br><br>I'm a regular reader on the main Warrior board, at Stratics, and in a thread on pulling recently an argument was made that a good puller is essentially just someone with a good memory for spawns and pathing and a knowledge of MoB's aggro radii. This poster was very denigrating about the skills of a puller, and even the best and most prideful pullers on the board agreed that he was essentially right.<br><br>I felt such pity. On Vallon when a warrior is in her best armor, in dangerous territory, a long way from her group, the spawn times of computer MoBs is strictly a secondary consideration. Even when you have a zone memorized, you're still always on the lookout, sharp and alert...at any time, an adventure can find you. <br><br>7) Vallon has a HISTORY of nations and a politics. Unlike Blue servers, racial hatreds aren't a static lookup on a database table, they evolve. It's fascinating to read about the fates of the four nations on our server as they won and lost influence, as zone controls shifted and attitudes changed. And you can aspire to something besides personal aggrandizement...you can imagine changing history.<br><br>Elf-Gnome relations have been particularly volatile since I came on the server in December. When I first got on, a low-level Gnome could run to Crushbone and level. But a series of Shorty-only PK guilds who hunt contstantly in GFay has changed all that. GFay has become the most savage zone in the game. Corpses everywhere. On the other hand, if an Elf and a Gnome meet out in Qeynos, they're almost instant friends. That's deep human territory. I see a High Elf walking toward me, my gut clenches up and I stop, and so does he, but before long we're bowing and swapping food and buffs and promising to help each other if someone tries to PK us. <br><br>8) I love the POLITICS involved in cross-teaming. I've been betrayed by group members, I've made good Dark friends, I've been forced to group with Darkies who hated my guts but who needed me at the time to get a job done. It's fascinating. <br><br>9) Vallon has BORDERS. This makes for many interesting consequences. For instance, some items are MUCH harder to get than on a Blue server, and when you get them they're so much rarer, and so naturally you're much prouder of them. Crude Steins, for instance, might sell for 20 pp on a Blue server, but they'll go for 10 times that in Freeport on Vallon. Small Bronze is very hard for a Dark Elf to get, since it drops only in Unrest, a light zone. The Gatorsmash Maul requires kills in Crushbone and Ogguk, the Wee Harvester requires adventuring in Rivervale, the Karanas, and Ferrot. You can make a killing by SMUGGLING these things, but that has its own risks...if you want to sell a Langseaxe in Nektulous, both of you at some point are going to have a huge quantity of cash on you and be vulnerable to a backstab.<br><br>And you don't find jarring combinations in newbie zones. Dark Elves don't run over to Misty Thicket to level, or if you see an Erudite levelling in GFay, that's a once-in-a-lifetime event. Some zones are war zones...you'll find 70 people in Nektulous daily, but maybe 10 in East Commons, and only a few of those are there to level. <br><br>10) On Vallon the ECONOMY works much better than blue servers. Items retain their values pretty consistantly. For instance, Bronze sells for about 2pp per AC, Banded for 1pp. Trade skills are actually worth something...if you're a master smith or a master tailor, you have an endless supply of decent armor. <br><br>If Vallon goes coin-only, then many of these things will disappear. Role-playing becomes an affectation. Without the ability to commit truly despicable acts, it also becomes impossible to commit noble ones. No good, no evil...everyone becomes sort of neutral unless they want to pretend to be something different for a little while. The server becomes less risky, more predictable, less exciting. It's no more challenging to level than on any Blue server, so a lot of the pride goes away. There's no reason to develop PvP tactics except as a hobby. Anyone can twink, the borders become soft, the economy gets as bad as on the Blue servers. <br><br>I don't want to see that happen. There's little enough server diversity in EQ. I'd hate to see a unique server become just another Care Bear server. I think Vallon is the best server in the game. I don't want to lose it. <br><br>Caper the Periodically Poignant Gemchopper<br>Level 18 Warrior Vallon Zek.<br><br><b><i>You're using Roleplaying as your argument here. However, Roleplaying doesn't require that items be looted in order to play your role as an anti-PK police guild. The "crime" of killing someone and taking their coin doesn't have to be any less important than the "crime" of killing them and taking an item. This is espicially true when the chances of getting an item back from someone, unless they are the honorable sort who always wears their gear, is very slim. <br><br>As for the rest, I have read it, and though I appreciate your opinion, we do not plan on changing Vallon back. The arguments here are roughly the same ones as on Tallon when the coin-only change was made there. Your arguments aren't any less important than those of the people who wanted coin-only loot, however the item-loot people was a much smaller population. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

A few posts were made today on the Gameplay Board by Sony's Gordon Wrinn:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055851.html"><b>eBay</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: sorry phelan..but that is not good enough. Before everyone goes and flames this "musk" you need to know it is him. ANYONE at all with a FA coold sell their account and try to MAKE it seem like it was this guy...hmmmmm would maybe casue people to try and bid more.]</i> <br><br>Very true, and it's the same issue that we face daily. We've already had several cases of people putting up auctions, making it appear to be someone on their server who they don't like, in an attempt to get them banned. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055820.html"><b>Does EQ Support Dual Processors?</b></a><br>Though EQ will run on a multiprocessor machine, any performance increase will be negligible. The application, though multithreaded, wasn't built specifically to take advantage of multiple processors.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055872.html"><b>Jumping Into the Hole</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: No one said not to levitate in... Read the patch message again it didnt say.]</i> <br><br>The patch message included: <br><br>"As a note, jumping in The Hole from Paineel is NO LONGER A SHORTCUT TO TOXXULIA FOREST. The GMs will not recover corpses for people who fall, or jump, or attempt to levitate into The Hole." <br><br>I felt that this was as clear as I could make it without completely spelling it out. The risk of exploring new zones is quite high, and it should be. It really wouldn't be appropriate for us to describe in detail everything that can kill you. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055457.html"><b>Rubricite & Manastones</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I was wondering why Verant doesn't put rubicite back in the game? It is so rare now that the price is inflated too high for its worth.]</i> <br><br>Prices never inflate too high for its "worth". The economy doesn't allow that to happen, as no one will pay more than it is "worth" to them. As for putting it back in, I suppose that it's possible that it might make an appearance or two. <br><br>The manastone, however, will not go back in. The manastone stopped dropping due to balance issues associated with it. Rubicite stopped dropping due to rampant camping.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055891.html"><b>If I do "this" will I get in trouble?</b></a><br>It basically falls under fraud or harassment. Someone is bugging you for a port, you agree to port them, you port them someplace else. You do something other than what you agreed to do. Next thing you know the guy is dead, and lost experience due to something that another player did intentionally. It's basically the same as purposely training someone. <br><br>Now if someone is harassing you with non-stop agressive begging, and refuses to leave you alone when you tell them to, please /report and /petition a GM. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055923.html"><b>Experience Loss & Death</b></a><br>Experience loss on death isn't calculated as a number of bubbles, but rather a numeric value. That value, is however, capped at the higher levels. In other words, a level 60 person will appear to lose less experience (comparing "bubbles") than a level 55 person.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055928.html"><b>Manastones and The Hole</b></a><br>The Hole shouldn't be marked as a "Kunark" zone, so the manastone should work fine at the moment. </UL>

Here's the first round of posts and excerpts made by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board today:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055248.html"><b>Dragons: Solutions Not Complaints</b></a><br>We're always open to better solutions to the problem. Of course in this case, I don't think that anyone will be happy with anything that reduces their ability to contribute once they get too high in level. <br><br>One suggestion I've seen was that people's ability to affect dragons should be scaled back as they go up in level, such that perhaps a level 58 warrior couldn't do as much damage as a level 52 warrior versus a dragon. Though this would most likely accomplish the same goal, I don't know how well it would fit into the world.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055250.html"><b>More Dragon Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: And where is it we find the "other dragons" that have the unique loot that you have places ONLY on these two dragons?]</i> <br><br>The same loot? I doubt you find that. However there's nothing to stop you from trading the loot you find on other dragons for some of the loot you can get on Vox and Nagafen.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055245.html"><b>Gobblins Banishing Players</b></a><br>Yes, we are aware, and it is not the intent. It will be fixed this evening. SolB is fine, however. <br><br>Sorry for the problem.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055182.html"><b>Zone Level Limits</b></a><br>For zones, you are correct, we aren't interested in putting level ceilings on particular zones. Having an NPC use different abilities based upon the level of the attacker is something else entirely. <br><br>"You are too strong to enter here" doesn't fit well into the environment. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055223.html"><b>Find Other Dragons</b></a><br>The change wasn't made to restrict people over 52 from fighting dragons, but to restrict the level of assistance they can render fighting these TWO dragons. Other dragons in the world are not affected by this change. <br><br>I realize that this is not a solution that will make everyone happy, but the situation the way it was wasn't making everyone happy either. This change should help give everyone a chance. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055159.html"><b>Can't Zone Into Permafrost</b></a><br>It's a small bug. Only Vox is supposed to have that ability. We'll be bringing down permafrost this evening to fix it. Nagafen's Lair is working correctly. <br><br>I apologize for the problem.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055123.html"><b>Druids, Animals and Charm</b></a><br>Though I'd certainly like to see more critters out there marked as "animals" to allow druids to charm them, we don't plan on giving druids a way to permanently charm an animal, as they are not a pet class. The ability to have a pet, for any period of time, certianly makes them stronger for that period, so I hope you consider it a benefit. <br><br>As a note, we have introduced an animal-only resistance debuff which should help with some of those charm times. However I suspect that you might need to check out some Charisma gear to extend the duration of your charms.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055151.html"><b>Locked Doors: Another Options</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: A better solution would be to not allow NPCs to walk through locked doors at all. How come that rat in Befallen can open a door (locked or not) anyway?]</i> <br><br>The problem is that spell effects don't collide with objects or world geometry. In other words, as was done at one point in beta, people could cast rain spells and such and have it affect NPCs on the other side of the door, with no risk to the caster.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055119.html"><b>Dragon Complaints</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why won't Gordon/Abashi comment on dragon complaints?]</i> <br><br>I've commented on several other threads as well. You might want to check out the "search" funtion, it can help you find the active discussions which we are participating in. <br><br>It's not unusual for situations like this to result in dozens of threads where everyone is asking similar questions or making similar arguments. In these cases, it makes the most sense for me to only concentrate on a couple of them. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055108.html"><b>Lockpicking Negatively Affects Players?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well, I don't know about your servers, but on mine there are probably 5-6 level 50+ rogues.]</i><br><br>With the lockpicking change, 3 of the 4 level 50+ dungeons in the game now require a rogue to access all/part of them. Now the 2 to 3 50+ rogues that are online at any given time have absolute control over where the other 100's of level 50+ players can go. <br><br>Players have always shown a remarkable ability to adapt to changing conditions. I doubt it will be long before we see a surge in rogue population in response to this change. <br><br>I think everything will work out well :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055056.html"><b>Nagafen/Vox</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: You never once said we'd be punished for levelling beyond 50th]</i> <br><br>This is a special case. As I stated in the patch message, our goal was to avoid having to raise the bar for existing players. Had we been able to make no changes, and still have the result be that the 40s and low 50s were killing the dragons, we would have done so. However every week I've gotten more and more reports of high-50s folk coming in with a small number of people and besting the dragons. <br><br>We still think that the lower level folks deserve a chance. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: After FoH killed Trakanon, we saw that he shared the same loot tables as Vox and Nagafen.]</i> <br><br>No, he doesn't. I looked at the items that they got off of Trakanon, and they are certainly different than anything that has been found in game. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: It does not say that characters lvl 53 and over would be BANNED from Vox & Nagafen raids.]</i> <br><br>Very true, and I'll let the players figure out exactly how it works. I still think that they'll be able to assist in some fashion or another, but it's not going to be the same old strategy.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055078.html"><b>FA Quest/Dragons</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Was the FA Quest, taken into consideration, before this Dragon *enhancement* was done?]</i><br><br>Well, we haven't done anything to restrict level 53+ paladins from looting the items, so I wouldn't say that it's been placed out of reach. That said, we are going to discuss this issue further in our next tuning meeting.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055079.html"><b>Shrink Anywhere Potions</b></a><br>I'll see if I can walk this issue through. I apologize that it's taking so long to get this change made.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055087.html"><b>Bug While Following Mobs</b></a><br>This happens due to the way collision with objects works server-side versus the prediction engine of the client. Basically, the server doesn't acknowledge the object (a tree for instance) so has the NPC walk through it. The client on the other hand sees the NPC hit the tree, and figures that he NPC will get stuck walking up against it. <br><br>In a few seconds, the server resync's the client and everything is updated. It's one of the minor drawbacks to the system that we adopted to minimize the effects of internet latency and reduce bandwidth usage.</UL>

<a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid961699856,47777,">The Bottom Line</a> is the most recent addition to <a href="/lore/shadoe">Shadoe's Corner</a>.  "Bottom Line" tackles many different issues and aspects of the customer service system, the Vision (TM), upcoming competition and more.  Needless to say, it's a very unique article and definitely worth the read.  Here's an except:<UL><i>The truth of that standpoint is subjective. It makes no sense that a company whose life's blood flows from its customers (is there any other kind of company?) would so callously hold them in the same regard as sheep. A spurned customer base is a short-lived customer base, and hence the same can be said for the business. So, I think it's safe to say that Verant, in fact, does care for its players as a community. Which begs the residual question: Do they care for their players as individuals? Should they?</i></UL>Thanks Shadoe!

Today's big Patch Message is up on the Patch Server now.  It reads as follows:<UL>June 22nd, 9:00am<br>-----------------<br><br>***Today's Updates***<br><br>*The Hole*<br><br>We are pleased to announce the opening of The Hole, a high-level dungeon on the continent of Odus.  The Hole is a complementary addition to EverQuest, available to all subscribers regardless of their Kunark status.  The files necessary to enter The Hole are available via the "Optional Patch" button at the bottom of the patch program interface.  The files are quite large (about 9MB total), so if the download is going slowly, you may want to postpone downloading the files until later.<br><br>As mentioned above, The Hole is a high-level dungeon, designed to support characters starting at about level 40.  It should be regarded as extremely dangerous.  As a note, jumping in The Hole from Paineel is NO LONGER A SHORTCUT TO TOXXULIA FOREST.  The GMs will not recover corpses for people who fall, or jump, or attempt to levitate into The Hole. <br><br><br>*Vallon Zek is now Coin-Only*<br><br>As we announced earlier this week, due to the number of people specifying interest in "coin-only" loot on Vallon Zek, versus those wishing to retain item- loot, we have implemented "coin-only" looting rules for PvP combat on Vallon Zek.<br><br><br>*Resurrection*<br><br>Previously, players had to be resurrected within two hours after death in order to receive any experience back as part of the resurrection.  Due to the increased size and difficulty associated with Kunark zones, we've raised this limit from two hours to three.  This should assist players and make it easier for them to obtain an experience-returning resurrection within the time limit.<br><br><br>*Warping*<br><br>We put in some code that should help decrease the "ghosting" (NPCs appearing to be some place they aren't) being reported in some of the larger Kunark zones.  Please let us know how this goes.<br><br><br>*Locked Doors*<br><br>We noticed few weeks ago that it is common practice to use NPCs to open locked doors rather than by using the services of someone that is able to pick locks.  In order to protect and increase the value of the abilities of the lock-picking classes, NPCs have gained the ability to walk through locked doors without opening them. <br><br><br>*Vox and Nagafen*<br><br>Over the past couple of weeks, we've received more and more reports of these dragons being bested by smaller and smaller groups of higher-level (high 50s) adventurers.  As we've always felt that Dragons should be special encounters that require a large number of people, we were left with some choices.<br><br>One choice available to us was to increase the power of the dragons to a level where the level 60 folks would find them challenging.  This would have the disadvantage of forever placing them out-of-reach for those who did not buy Kunark, and place them further out-of-reach for those who did, but are just now approaching the levels where they could go on Dragon raids. Another possible solution was to make the dragons flee (depop) when engaged by a more powerful group of people.  This would have the undesired effect of allowing some people to deny others the experience of fighting a dragon.<br><br>Instead of raising the bar as mentioned above, we've instead decided that dragons, or at least these two dragons, should have the magical ability to pick their own fights.  Players of level 53 or above will now encounter some difficulty when attempting to assist in combat with these dragons.  This should help 40s and low 50-level characters with their chances to encounter a dragon without worry of getting forced out by much higher level players.  In addition, it also has the added effect of creating a natural progression from the younger dragons of Antonica to the elder and more formidable dragons of Kunark.<br><br>-The EverQuest Team</UL>
