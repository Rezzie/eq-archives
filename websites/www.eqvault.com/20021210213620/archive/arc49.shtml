There were/are alternate ways to get those items. The faction loss was a choice the player made to get the item one way rather than the other. We won't be changing any factions over this. <br><br>Exchanges (or perhaps just changing all existing instances of these items) are something that we are reevaluating. When we've come to a decision on what the replacement effect will be, we'll then decide about how to deal with existing items.</UL>

This is news to note for those <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627.html">attempting to hand in a quest item</a>:<UL><I>I wanted to talk to all of you about the way turning in quest items works. We are thinking about making a change here, and I'd like to talk about it.<br><br>Let me set up a fictional example. Let's say that there is a quest NPC that gives out the final item for the quest in exchange for three other items. Currently, if you give the NPC two of the correct items and a third item that you think is the correct item but isn't, the NPC will take all of the items and give you nothing. This seems like a rude thing for the NPC to do.<br><br>Also, if someone has come along and given the NPC one of the three items before you arrive, and you give him the three correct items all at once he'll give you the quest result, but the person that gave the one item previously will get nothing (the NPC is, basically, letting you complete the transaction that he started).<br><br>Both of these situations cause someone to lose out. That's not something that we like.<br><br>We've been thinking about making a change to the way this whole turning in quest items thing works. The most reasonable and eloquent solution to this problem would be to simply have the NPC give the items back if they are not enough to complete the quest. This would mean that if you give him one item, he would give it back to you and tell you that he needs more than just that item to give you what you want. If you give him two correct items and an incorrect item, he would give the quest items back to you and tell you that you made a mistake (he might or might not give you back the mistaken item, depending on the technical ability to get him to do that).<br><br>This would fix a bunch of problems with questing. But, as you all have probably guessed, it would eliminate the ability to 'multi-quest'. We know that the whole concept of multi-questing is a touchy one.<br><br>So I have a question for you. Would eliminating the problems with losing quest items to NPCs be worth the loss of the ability to multi-quest?<br><br>Alan</I></UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627.html">Click here</a> to jump to that thread.

From Safka Fairheart:<BLOCKQUOTE>Two new episodes this week as the chapters "The Blood of Friends" and "The <br>Lair Beneath" continue, so be you a newcomer to our tale or an avid follower <br>please drop by a take a read . .<br><br>* The Blood of Friends Part 4 *<br><br>A great-carved platform stood out from the centre of the platform. Judging <br>by the foliage arranged atop it, Safka could only imagine that it was the <br>resting-place of the dragon herself. A series of ornate steps lead up to <br>smaller man sized platform some twelve paces or so above the main structure.<br><br>&#8220;That must be some form of audience area,&#8221; Safka guessed, &#8220;so that you can <br>speak to the dragon at it&#8217;s eye level.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Heh,&#8221; laughed Iste, &#8220;aye, I guess straining her neck to lean down to our <br>level might get a bit painful.&#8221;<br><br>The cleric smiled and nodded, &#8220;Although I don&#8217;t think she has had too many <br>visitors of late. Rumour of a place like this would spread like wildfire <br>amongst the adventurers of Norrath had any found it.&#8221;<br><br>A pair of the smaller dragons swooped down in a swift arc and landed before <br>them, immediately propping up on their hind legs and spreading their wings <br>to their full extension, barring their way any further down the path.<br><br>By now Iste was not surprised to find that they talked in common speak. Half <br>an hour before he might not have believed anyone who had told him of talking <br>dragons.<br><br>&#8220;Sssssstate your business.&#8221; Rasped the first of the dragons, pointing at <br>Safka with a curled claw.<br><br>&#8220;Your lady Gorenaire has invited us down to her home.&#8221; She explained bowing <br>serenely, and tugging Iste&#8217;s arm to make him bow as well.<br><br>The two dragons looked at each other briefly before the one that had <br>addressed them stepped forward.<br><br>&#8220;Invited you sssay?&#8221; it stated, looking them up and down, &#8220;ssstrange stature <br>of guests our lady seeks out today, bessst get to the audience podium then <br>you had. If you are lying ssshe will soon make dinner of you.&#8221;<br><br>The other dragon flapped its leather like wings excitedly. &#8220;Dinnerssss, yes <br>we have not eaten today, Elf tastes good from whats I remember.&#8221;<br><br>Safka gulped and looked at Iste<br><br>&#8220;Buts nothing to worry you if you are indeeds invited.&#8221; The first dragon <br>confirmed smirking, before turning to its brethren, &#8220;barbarian is too tough <br>though, not as sweet as the elf.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Well at least I would give them indigestion,&#8221; Iste leant over and whispered <br>to Safka.<br><br><br>* To read on visit us at <a href="http://safkaslore.webjump.com">http://safkaslore.webjump.com</a> *<br><br>Many Thanks<br><br>Safka Fairheart</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Safka! :)

Muertos A`Todos sent in this event announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Many ages ago, back when the Ogres lived on the land known as Faydwer in <br>lands taken from the Orc hoards, a great warrior step forward and created a <br>mighty kingdom.  This warlord&#8217;s name was Raknok and his empire was named <br>after him.<br><br>Several ages past and the fifth warlord of Raknok&#8217;s kingdom, Dagnor, began a <br>war on the Dwarven city of Kaladim.  Dagnor rallied all the Ogre forces <br>together and began a march onto the Dwarf Kingdom.  The great warlord&#8217;s army <br>assaulted every Dwarfish outpost and home between them and the city.  Now <br>this seemed like a good idea to rid as much land of the filthy little Dwarfs <br>as possible before the final battle at Kaladim, but the plan backfired.  <br>Dagnor&#8217;s raiding gave the Dwarfish King a chance to form they&#8217;re own army to <br>defend Kaladim from the Ogre onslaught approaching.  Sadly the Dwarf army <br>was able to advance and conquer over the powerful Ogres, with some aid from <br>the neighboring Elven Empire to the east.  The spot of this defeat was then <br>named after the warlord by the Dwarfs to mock the Ogres, Dagnor&#8217;s Cauldron.<br><br>The few Ogres that survived the war were forced to leave the land of Faydwer <br>and cross the Ocean of Tears to Antonica.  Here in the southern jungles of <br>Feerrott the Ogres built a new home and named it Oggok (which means Revenge <br>in the Ogre language for those of you that don&#8217;t speak Ogre). After all <br>these years the time has finally come for vengeance on the Dwarven Kingdom.  <br>How you ask?  The answer is simple; King Kazon Stormhammer (the current king <br>of Kaladim) will pay for what his ancestors did to the Ogres with his own <br>blood!<br><br>Commander Dervishh Dwarfslayer of Soldiers of Lost Souls is asking for all <br>Ogres and any other enemies of the Dwarfish race to unite to crush the <br>Kingdom of Kaladim and its king.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br>Server: Mithaniel Marr<br>What: Kaladim Raid<br>When: Saturday, March 10th, 6:00 P.M EST<br>Where: Meet at Butcherblock / Dagnor&#8217;s Cauldron zone<br>Who: All enemies of Kaladim<br>Sponsored by: Soldiers of Lost Souls<br>E-Mail class/level to soldiersoflostsouls@hotmail.com to sign up.

It might have been an improvement because of the way the skill worked, but reducing their cap would probably have upset people. <br><br>All that really matters now, though, is that it's pretty much the way we want it, and it's working great.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063452.html"><b>On Magical Death Item</b></a><br>Never heard of it. <br><br>And, well, maybe they were pulling your leg.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063448.html"><b>New Producer's Letter</b></a><br>Ok, it wasn't actually written by the producer&#8230; but it's up anyhow. <br><br><a href="http://www.everquest.com/main/letter.jsp">Take a look by clicking here</a>.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062802-2.html"><b>Wizards and the Vision</b></a><br>Calvarro wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Yes, we are making some positive changes to wizards.]</i></font><br><br>Yes, we are making some positive changes to wizards. <br><br>Alan <br><br>I'm not being flippant.

But that doesn't mean that there won't be new servers some time in the near future, just that there aren't any plans that I know of for one.

Until we're done testing them we don't know. But it seems likely that at least some of the changes on Test currently will go live. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 8. When the servers drop as they did today can we PLEASE get something posted on the system status/scheduled downtime page to inform us of what is going on?]</i></font> <br><br>That often depends on why they went down. Often the servers seem to go down because of ISP problems at one end or the other. We do our best to get a notice up. But for very short-term outages it's not always practical or useful to put up a notice. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 9.

Perhaps you should reword that and ask again. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 24. Do you play on a live server?]</i></font> <br><br>Sure do. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 25. If the answer to 24 is Yes is your character above lvl 50?]</i></font> <br><br>I don't talk about my characters. I will not reveal level, class, race&#8230; none of that. Doing so, unless I could claim to have played all classes and all races to 60th level, would do nothing to improve my credibility. It would only serve to focus people on the facts of my class preferences and be a hindrance to conversation on nearly any topic. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 26. Are there plans to give the clerics a JOLT type spell in the next 2 months?]</i></font> <br><br>Not that I know of. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 27. Are there plans to implement more portal type spells in the next 2 months?]</i></font> <br><br>Not that I know of. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 28. Are there plans to revamp POA in the next 2 months?]</i></font> <br><br>I don't know. I haven't heard any such rumors. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 29.

Again, we'll announce them when we know them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 30.

It seems unlikely to me, though. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Are there plans to reduce the Spellbook med from lvl 35 to lvl 20 within the next 3 months?]</i></font> <br><br>Not that I know of. <br><br>Sorry, I don't follow restrictions like only yes or no. :)  They certainly don't make your questions easier to answer. Some of your questions just can't be answered with only a yes or no. My general answer is that we'll announce changes as we decide them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061751.html"><b>The Term "Broken"</i></font></b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Stop using the term and come up with something that is more true to the situation.]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I only use that term when it's accurate.

This is the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063132.html">original post and Brad McQuaid's response</a> from a thread devoted to various community issues:<UL>They should just change things as they see appropriate. They should have invested the time and energy they put into these boards to have more people test the game actually IN-GAME.<br><br>It is THEIR game, they can make the rules however they want. Allowing the player base a forum to vent and suggest changes has actually decreased customer satisfaction. It looks good on paper, and is a tremendous effort to keep communication open, but it has been a failure. Yeah, they probably gleaned a little useful info off of these boards. But has it been worth the headaches? Have they gotten the return on the investment? NOW the customers perceive it is their RIGHT to mandate changes to VERANT's product. Of course we can just stop playing. If they never would have opened up this can of worms, players would just....PLAY. Of course we would get angry over issues or changes, but an open forum such as this amplifies dissatisfaction.<br>I know it is not quite right to compare other traditional games to EQ, but have you ever heard of a game or product manufacturer that goes through so much effort to solicit customer input? And 99% of these posts are negativem it seems.<br><br>I appreciate the effort, and I can imagine the meetings when they decided these boards were a good idea.<br><br>"Yes Alan, we will have a whole site dedicated to hearing our customer, and responding to their needs on an ongoing basis! Johnson, you work with Bradley and design it. That is the key to a long lasting MMPRPG people, real time customer feedback."<br>Maybe it has helped EQ to last longer. EQ has lasted a long time, and I bet will last a few years more. But they also have learned some very important lessons.<br><br>First, the majority of people in the world are selfish morons who are unable to see past the tip of their nose.<br><br>Second, soliciting input from this majority is a BIG DRAG and largely pointless. They end up spending days and hours and hours sifting through the unending load of crap and looking for a little gold.<br>And third, message board detail is NOT a fun assignment, but great for shuffling some poor schmuck into the limelight for 15 minutes. Wonder if just prior to reassigment here the next 'victim board moderator' goes home to his/her spouse all excited about their 'big break'? "Honey, this is big time, I am on the front line between our cutomers and the company. Man, I cant wait until Monday...this will really look good on a resume...I am really gonna change things there too"<br>Like I said the effort is appreciated, but the resource committment is misplaced.<br><br><same board moderator two weeks later><br>"Honey, nothing is WRONG, I just hate that place. I have been listening to people whine and cry all day on that @#$@ board, I dont need you whining now when I get home..." <br><br><b><i>Thanks for the feedback so far (excluding the x-files Aradune = Manglosh sillyness).<br><br>We will continue to read this thread very carefully.<br><br>I will say that if we do make a major change, we will still absolutely have a very real means by which our players can give us feedback. This board has been a huge resource for us (and hopefully many of you) -- many, many changes have been made because of ideas and feedback from this board, and so any change we might make cannot risk losing that feedback.<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>

George M. Scotto wrote the latest <a href="http://www.everquest.com/main/letter.jsp">Producer Letter</a> found on the official EQ site.  Customer Service and several policy updates were the main focus of this letter.  The big and most important points of the letter can be found in this excerpt:<UL>Communication will be the key and, naturally, it&#8217;s a two way street. Your concerns have been voiced to us, and we are responding. As you read this, several policies are in the process of being refined. Within the coming weeks, we will be posting several new policy FAQ&#8217;s at <a href="http://www.everquest.com/support/index.jsp.">http://www.everquest.com/support/index.jsp.</a> Our goal is to make it perfectly clear not only what we expect from you as player-citizens of Norrath, but also what you can count on from us here at Verant/SOE. <br><br>Our first step in response to players&#8217; concerns was posted recently. Our new and updated Naming Policy (<a href="http://www.everquest.com/support/naming.jsp">http://www.everquest.com/support/naming.jsp</a>) should hopefully be clearer, more consistent, and bring us even closer to a healthy role-playing environment. Subsequently, we will be conducting a thorough review of all current character names on all servers, including surnames and guild names. Names not necessarily in line with the updated Naming Policy will be evaluated and handled accordingly. </UL>Thanks Alan.

Perhaps they are sneaking a quick peek (and hand) into your pockets when you're not looking.<br><br>This "just for fun" test will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the live cuisinart blade masters of Norrath.
