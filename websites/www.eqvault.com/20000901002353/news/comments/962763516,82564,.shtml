He's saying that a monster chasing you, watching you essentially trip to the ground and go &quot;Ahhh&quot;, and deciding &quot;Well he's dead.  I'll leave him alone.  Hey wait!  He's faking it!  He got up!  Oh wait.. he's dead again.  Oh wait!  He's standing!  Damn he fell again.&quot;  and so on, is rediculous.  From a role play point of view.  How does a shout like &quot;Where's my corpse?&quot; relate to this?  Unless you're trying to get at someone shouting &quot;Where is my corpse&quot; isn't very realistic, which would be retarted because this is a fantasy world.  And you're role-playing a fantasy life.  In which corpses of yourself exist.  Two VERY different ideas here.  But please.. clarify.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Verant says that Feign Death is unrealistic... how about monsters that can walk THROUGH locked doors? It's okay for Verant to violate the &quot;realism&quot; of roleplay when it's convenient for them, but if a player uses the powers his character was GIVEN by Verant (like Feign) in a legitimate tactical capacity, suddenly it's not okay from a &quot;roleplay&quot; standpoint. Face it, it's a lot more realistic for a PC to cause a commotion outside a dungeon door, thus provoking the curiosity of the mobs inside... and jumping into the dungeon when said door opens.... than it is for the same mobs to walk THROUGH locked doors just so Verant can increase the difficulty of the game.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email jaeron_s@hotmail.com end_email start_name Jaeron end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->So you're saying then, Rupert, that this is a logical comparison?  Because a corpse IS fantasy.  Without a corpse, if you die, you're dead.  Gone forever, restart a new char.  How many people would play a game like that?  (Without it being just a side thing, like Hardcore in Diablo 2.)  Feign making a monster or even a person.. such as a guard or whatever, of decent intelligence deciding &quot;Duh uh.. George, which way did he go George.. oh duh.. he fell on da floor!  I not need chase him now.&quot;  is not fantastic in any sense of the word.  See the difference?  Yes the locked door thing is cheesy mind you, but it's incredibly cheesy to make the monsters walk through the door at all.  Unless if you kill them, you find a key on their corpse.  I don't agree with every Verant change, obviously some are a little harder to understand then others, but I've had alot of experience with balance, being a mudder for 6 years, and watching games evolve through sequals etc.. for all my life.  Personally, it woulda been better to make the monster stay stuck behind the door, though I can see people cheesing the hell out of that, so I understand why they did what they did.  You need to use &quot;process&quot; to figure out why they did something they did.  Yes they don't want you to be able to solo something, as the entire point of the game is reliance on eachother.  There IS no single player mode.  This is NOT a single player game.  If you want to be all powerful, and be able to kill anything and everything alone, go play something else.  Please.  Now bottom line is, while I don't say that a valid argument would be &quot;We only do things that are realistic and balancing.&quot; to argue rather or not monsters should walk through doors, or corpses should be looted, I'm just saying that in this particular case, the looting of a corpse should have absolutely nothing to do with arguing that feign death pulling is cheesy.<br><br>Jaeron -Shadowstalker, Merc for Hire, at your service.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

It takes quite a great deal of skill to feign pull.  It is a skill that I am still learning.  It is not an exploit, but a tactic.  It is no more unrealistic than dragons or spellcasters in Norrath.  What if when a monk FDs he creates a strong Psychic impression in the NPCs' minds that makes them believe that the monk is dead?  Sometimes it works (the skill fails or the NPC in question sees through the FD due to ability or level).  Is that more palatable to you?  What is cheesy to me is watching a 15th level magician take out a green level creature to my 20th monk (at the time) by using chain root and blasts spells.  I couldn't melee the same creature.  Isn't that an exploit of the calss abilites or just good tactics on the part of the player?  I say its cheese, others will say its tactics.  That is a difference of opinion.  <br><br>Shando<br>Bertoxx  <!--ktalk end_comment-->

You should be able to just type the command /corpse and summon your corpse from anywhere in the game.  I mean.. it's not realistic to do so, but neither is having a corpse in the first place right?  So I got another great idea.. lets set humans the ability to fly.. without wings.. it's not realistic, but this is a fantasy world.  If corpses can exist, humans can fly.  And pigs.. don't forget pigs.  You take an idea to the extreme just to prove yourself right, when in actuality, all you did in my eyes, was show me that you have no point to argue other then to spout over and over &quot;Well you can't have unrealistic and realistic in the same game!&quot;  You sure as hell can.<br><br>As for monks feigning for pulling being a tactic, and not an exploit, you're right.  I never said it wasn't a tactic to split up spawns.  But I DID say that the intended purpose of the spell/skill was not to make them the premier pullers in the game.  Period.  The intention of the skill was escaping sure death situations.  And it is still stupid to have someone of good intelligence chase you, turn around when you fall, turn around again when you stand up, turn around when you fall, turn around again when you stand up, etc.. at some point he says &quot;Well crap.  He's faking it.&quot;  Period.  You can argue how I'm contradicting myself just so that you don't have to bring up a single valid point in the discussion, or you can actually try contributing something to this.  Should I resort to pointing out your grammar errors such as punctuation as soon as you prove to have a valid point that I can't argue?  I mean come on already.<br><br>Jaeron -Shadowstalker, Merc for Hire, at your service.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name  end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Some good points here.  I agree the FD thing is silly from a RP angle.  It's nothing though compared to one of the fundamental cheesy things of EQ: item farming.<br><br>I can't really see any roleplay angle for item farming.  It's ridiculous and pretty much defeats any sense of adventure.  What brave band of fantasy heroes sits on their arses for hours on end killing the same monster over and over again for treasure?  <br><br>I think if Verant finially admitted that EQ is not a role playing game but rather a hack-and-slash dungeon fest things would be much better.<br>Thats my opinion though.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Does this give me geekdom or something?<br><br>Anyways back to reality.<br><br>Jaeron, the fallacy of extension isn't going to help you any. Your obviously trying to extend some theoretical arguement to great heights in order to look like an idiot. Please don't do it, I might get included by topical relation. That would make me mad.<br><br>My point of you contradicting yourself WAS the point. It is a fantasy game. Who says that monks don't have some magical or psychic ability (someone else above pointed this out) that makes their feign death work the way it does? Sheesh in real-life there are reports of similar things being done by masters of various martial arts.<br><br>The point is that Verant is not willing to simply provide &quot;tools&quot; or &quot;abilities&quot; and let the players learn how to use them. This is actually what happened. Now they are complaining because we didn't &quot;do it the right way&quot;. Wooohaw. <br><br>If it was something terribly unbalancing (such as how necromancers were using it so they wouldn't be hurt while their pet fought) then I would agree that there is a problem. But simply because the players figured out how to do something new with the tools they've been given? I'd be going &quot;YEAH! Smart players!&quot;<br><br>I don't often see a lot of games that penalize their players for investing new ways of doing stuff. Most of the time the players are praised for their skill and ingenuity. Not in EQ, not by Verant. Instead they scream &quot;oh the players are ruining our game! make it stop! make them stop!&quot;<br><br>Thats a pretty poor attitude.<br><br>If you think an arguement needs to be made against FD, then I would like to challenge you to tell me how FD is a problem. A real problem. Not just peeing match for Brad because everyone isn't playing by his vision.<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I never said it wasn't a tactic to split up spawns. But I DID say that the intended purpose of the spell/skill was not to make them the premier pullers in the game. Period. The intention of the skill was escaping sure death situations.&quot;  I guess I have to quote myself, sad as that may be, to show that I have nothing against the way people figured out an awesome tactic in Feign.  I'm just telling you WHY they don't like that it's used in that way.  If an item was put in that gave you perfect faction with everyone, like say.. you attack one dar ghoul in guk and the lord doesn't get pulled because of the godly faction you have cause of this item, people would pull using it, it would be a tactic, but it would be cheesy.  Rather or not I think it should be nerfed, in the case of the item, definately.  In the case of the Feign, perhaps not.  It still takes some skill to do.  What am I getting at?  I never said I had a problem with Feign, just think it has nothing to do with what they wanted the skill to do.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

If your intention was otherwise, then I apologize. However my point still stands - whether or not that is what the skill was intended to do, Verant has a poor attitude by telling the players that they aren't doing what Verant wants them to do.<br><br>Blackjack, <br><br>You bring up some very valid points. It is true that most posters here are total idiots (both yourself and Jaeron appear to be above that pack however), and that Verant probably doesn't read these boards. Your probably also right in that I probably am not making an effect on Verant - of course no matter where I post I don't think I ever will.<br><br>But perhaps I like to post because I'm upset at such a good idea for a game going so sour? Besides, who would you argue with if I'm not here? It seems to me that you want to &quot;save me from the boards&quot; or something. I'm just curious why it matters... I'm probably giving some of the most intelligent posts on these topics you'll ever read, and you won't have that if I leave.<br><br>I guess I don't understand A&gt; why you really want me gone, and B&gt; what you expect to accomplish by convincing me to leave.<br><br>Perhaps you'd rather go back to hearing about player numnuts talk about his nerfed necro?<br><br>PS.

So I suppose you've targeted me, for complaining non-stop, for absolutely no reason.<br><br>As for Verant doing &quot;a pretty good job&quot;, please tell me you don't completely understand english!?! You can't possibly tell me that you don't see anything wrong with their responses, with their customer service, or with the various things that are brought up about the game.<br><br>Then tell me that you can't see anything wrong with how they are doing their job. Please tell me that your not the only one who can't see that they aren't doing as much as they possibly can, or as good as they can, using other successful developers as measuring sticks.<br><br>I'm sorry, I don't mean to try and attack you or anything, and I certainly don't hold your opinion against you. I just don't understand how you can say &quot;they are doing pretty good&quot; when their customer base is the most vocal out of any in existence (including UO's), and who has nothing but disdain for their players, and who constantly makes changes or designs that contradict what EVERY SINGLE successful game developer out there tells you in their &quot;how to make a game&quot; articles, post-mortems, and &quot;our success&quot; articles.<br><br>They lie, they spin things to intentionally mislead their players, they change the fundamental aspects of the game on a whim and without warning, and they refuse to budge on the worse design decisions they could possibly choose.<br><br>Their trade skills are money sinks that produce results worse than drops, their game is a camper's dream, and their &quot;player interaction&quot; abilities such as dueling and guild wars remain broken as far back as the beta. They have no security, their information is sent as plain text over the internet. They form policies to curtail behaviour that doesn't line up with their vision, and their customer service helps friends and people who kiss up to them. And they hold you, the player, responsible for all this because you won't shut up and let them have it their way. <br><br>I guess the reason I post here is because if I can convince one person that their $10 is contributing towards a negative force in the industry, and that person quits, I will have had an effect upon Verant. I wish with all my might that tommorrow Verant will have lost 50% of it's customer base, but that simply won't happen. So I do it the long and slow way, and perhaps somewhere along the line I'll become the &quot;100th monkey&quot;.<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

If a mask was made that perfected faction with everything so that you could do some quest, and someone started using it for pulling solo mobs, it would be the same thing.. not being used for it's intended purpose.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Valentinian end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Hmmmm...<br><br>Good debate here.<br><br>Here's how I see it. Rubert is right, Jaeron is right, as is BJA.<br><br>You all are right in one aspect or another. However, you all are also wrong, in one way or another...<br><br>Jaeron's last statement is wrong in many ways. Verant has a nack for nerfing/changing/altering things that they see as being &quot;misused&quot;<br><br>Prime example: Guise of the Deciever.<br><br>Remember those? That frog was camped 24/7 for one, and NOT just for Bards. Any large race that had an IQ of 2 knew what that mask meant. It meant not dying becuase ya can't get your huge body over the damn kobald in SolB that's blocking the tunnel.<br><br>Verant saw that other classes were &quot;misusing&quot; the mask. And nerfed it so that only bards could use it.<br><br>Sideffect: If you started a large race and didn't make it a Shaman, you are gunna die in SolA, SolB, LG, or any other small tunneled dungeon because: 1)You are too fat/tall to squeeze through the tunnel around another player who is quite possibly trying to save you, or around the mob in your way becuase you are the tank and the last one out... but one dog/frog got ahead of you in the tunnel somehow. 2)No shammy to shrink ya... refer to 1. 3) The &quot;Shrink Anywhere&quot; potions are still broken because Verant has deemed it &quot;Not immediatly important&quot; even though they have yet to get Alchemy to work right.... ever.<br><br>Now then, BJA and Jae are also correct in that simply put, &quot;Ranting on this board, does no good.&quot; Verant probably doesn't read these posts, and if they do, they would not admit it, let alone, post to one.<br><br>However, I have to contradict them with this:<br><br>...it can't hurt.<br><br>These are legitimate concerns of players, and have every right to be voiced and heard. It also acts as a pressure release. If you rant or point something out, and someone agrees with you that, yes, it is indeed broken, or stupid. It helps, and creates the feeling of. &quot;Maybe they will see this and fix it.&quot; It probably will not happen, but it might.<br><br>EQ is a step into the unknown, as was UO and AC. The problem here is that Verant doesn't admit when it's done wrong, and very rarely corrects or askes the paying public what they think of a change.<br><br>What it comes down to is this:<br><br>People post here to let their feelings known, and problems be heard. It's the constructive Rupert, BJA, Jae posts that help fuel the debate and hopefully bring it to resolution.<br><br>It's the flaming idoits that post 1-3 lines blasting a &quot;Whiner to shut up and quit.&quot; that lend no aid in furthering the cause of the game as a whole.<br><br>There are but 3 groups that find such profane and seeming enjoyable waste of the English language as to feel satistifed in posting within a 3 line post... 8 profanities... and no constructive criticism... 1) The Old (they've lived this long, they have the right to blast ya if they want) 2)the Juvenile (the youth who find swearing to be &quot;Kewl&quot; and makes them feel grown up) 3) The uneducated (they just don't know any better... no really... that's the limit of their vocabulary)<br><br>This arguement can go on for ages, but simply put, it will, and nothing can stop it. If EQ dies today, another game will takes it's place, and the same postings will arise anew.<br><br>I do have to congradulate those who sound off and defend their ideals as using these boards to the truest meaning that they were created for.<br><br>Just my opinion, I could be wrong,<br><br>Vale<br><br>- &quot;Dopeler effect:  The tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter when they come at you rapidly&quot; -<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email jaeron_s@hotmail.com end_email start_name Jaeron end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Well.. the guise of the deceiver was originally supposed to be worn for it to work.. I mean think about the idea of the item.  You wear a mask and it magically makes you look like a dark elf.  It was wearable only by rogue types, which in this game limits you to Rogue and Bard.  If this were the game this game was loosely based on, Sojourn, you woulda had Rogue split up into sub classes.  The main class division was Rogue.  There were assassins, thieves, mercenaries, and bards.  Thus you have the reason it was rogue and bard only on EQ.  It was a bug that was never fixed, the ability for everyone to use it.  Instead of completely &quot;nerfing&quot; it, they removed the drop of the item that allowed all classes to use it, but allowed anyone who got it, to keep it.  I think that was more then fair, and more then nice of them personally.  Granted, it would be nice for ogres to be able to switch to dark elves to make life easier, but thats one of the downsides of being a large race that has so many advantages.  (Regen and str bonus, etc.)  As for who can post here, anyone is entitled to their opinion, and I would never tell anyone to stop posting their opinion.  And I also said that if it was a mask, they would have nerfed it right away.  An item that was made for a purpose that is being misused.  Feign pulling prolly woulda been nerfed horribly if the public outcry hadn't been so big.  Thats all I'm saying.<br><br>Jaeron -Shadowstalker, Merc for Hire, at your service.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email cralis@home.com end_email start_name Rupert end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Valentinian,<br><br>You have a remarkable wisdom :-) Not to mention you made me laugh with your three types of bad posters!<br><br>Anyways this issue is about dead. Jaeron, even though your right in that ONE specific instance, having played a rogue for 7 months I could point out a number of instances where your example doesn't hold water.<br><br>But its not worth it. Bottom line - Verant is going to do what they want and then try and manipulate the players to feel what they want. Personally I think the reason feign wasn't nerfed was because their accountant said &quot;whoa! 30% of our players are monks so if a third of them quit, then we lose 10% of our revenue&quot;<br><br>What a way to calculate the risk of nerfing.<br><br>Blah.<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<!--ktalk end_comment-->
