Just compiled for your reading pleasure is today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042863.html"><b>Happy Holidays from Alan</b></a><br>I hope you all have a safe and merry holiday season. <br><br>I'm heading home now. I won't be in the office until January 2nd, 2001. I'll still be reading and posting from home when I have free time, but that might be fairly infrequent. <br><br>I'll see you all in the new year.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042844.html"><b>Summon Food and Drink Questions</b></a><br>I, very vaguely, seem to remember that at one time if you summoned an item and you had that item on your cursor AND one in your inventory, the newly summoned item would stack into your inventory. <br><br>It doesn't do that now. It works as Tween said it does. <br><br>Thanks for reminding me about that...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042820.html"><b>Shaman Talk, Part Deux</b></a><br>I also wanted to add this to the follow-up thread (a repost from the last thread): <br><br>Essentially, these are the key points that I've gleaned from this post so far (at the expense of doing much else this morning&#8230;): <br><br>Group buffs suck. You'd like them to be, basically, like casting the normal buff on everyone, but just all at once. I can easily advocate having them the same as regular buffs, with maybe twice the casting cost or something, and the same duration as the regular spells. <br><br>Healing: You'd like to be more useful healers, better able to reduce the burden on clerics. The idea of another spell at about 56th and move superior heal to 51, while reducing the fizzles on it (and the new spell), would probably be enough. Though better regens would be nice, you're aware that they aren't likely. <br><br>Pets: Enough already! :)<br><br>Alchemy: more stuff and a better return on the items made from vendors. And you need more How To books. Kilva's Skin of Flame is producing the same effect as Kilva's Blistering Flesh. Also, some potions require components, and they probably should not (levitate and water breathing as examples) <br><br>Fizzles on higher level spells: You don't like this&#8230; <br><br>DoTs: They should not be causing corpses to disappear. <br><br>Specific spells: <br><br>Torpor: "Torpor does not stack with the regen line. At the level you obtain this spell, as a Shaman you almost always (and I mean this, I have these spells on 99% of my online time - I NEVER take them off unless I've been newly resurrected) have PCP (Pack Chloroplast), regrowth of the grove, or regrowth on. Torpor will overwrite all of these spells, causing you to have to recast them. Thus reducing its overall usefulness because although Torpor is only 200 mana, if you have to then re-cast Regrowth for an additional 300 mana, you just cost yourself 500 mana for a 1200 point heal. You might as well have cast two superior heals. It'd have saved you a gem slot and casting time. Here is the important part: Torpor lasts 4 ticks (24 seconds). During those 4 ticks, at most you can hope to regain 60 health back with Regrowth. There is no exploit whatsoever in regenerating a puny 60 health back while under the effects of Torpor. Please make it stack with the Regen line so I can keep Torpor memorized and use it at will, instead of just when Regrowth wears off." <br><br>Tigir's Insects: The spell is cool, the drop is too rare. <br><br>Pox of Bert: Also too rare. But also perhaps not effective enough, might need a bit more damage output per tick. <br><br>Bane of Nife: too rare of a drop as well. <br><br>Voice of the Berserker: didn&#8217;t get fixed with the other Rage spells&#8230; <br><br>--- <br><br>Also, I included the Epic item concerns in my note to the team, I just forgot to add it here.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042797.html"><b>Item Names Misspelled</b></a><br>Sounds like a typo. <br><br>Post the name(s) of the items in question, or e-mail them to me and I'll see if I can get them fixed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042756.html"><b>Inspection Options</b></a><br>There really is no reason to turn off inspection. <br><br>Look at what actually happens when someone 'inspects' you: <br><br>The game doesn't show you all of the things that you would be able to see if you were standing there looking at the character, such as cloaks, necklaces, rings and all that. When you inspect someone, all you can find out is the name of the items they are wearing. Despite the common analogy, you are not looking at the label on their underwear. You are just seeing what they have on. <br><br>Turning off the message should really solve the problem for most people (I personally got annoyed having the game tell me that someone was looking at me).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042141.html"><b>Cleric BP Nerf</b></a><br>Sorry, Willow, I just don't see it as a useless effect. I still think it's pretty darn good, even with the 30 second cast time included. <br><br>*shrug*<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041362.html"><b>What else does Absor do?</b></a><br>A lot of what I do is answering e-mail, reading posts (I don't respond to all of them, but I do read most of them), talking to the team about stuff that comes up on the boards, sleeping, playing with my new EQ figures, trying to find a power cord for a computer, eating, sleeping some more... <br><br>Actually, I was shocked at how much time it takes to just keep up with the reading on this job. Keep in mind that I don't just read this board, I try to read as many as I can. <br><br>And then there's all that sleeping... </UL>

Back on the Gameplay Board, Alan made <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042342.html">one huge post</a> about the recent issues troubling the Shaman class:<UL><i>Hi everyone, <br><br>I've taken a bunch of topics out of various posts and cobbled together this monster. I ended up not getting the names of the original posters, I hope you can forgive me if I don't attribute your posts or your ideas. I guess I'm more interested in addressing the ideas than giving credit&#8230; <br><br>First, some news about a few things: <br><br>1) Despite what I previously wrote about our satisfaction with the 55th level pet spell, we are still looking at it. I'm not promising any changes. But the debate continues&#8230; <br><br>2) The Rage Line: All the spells in the line should be working along the same lines as Rage now. But we did find an error. Fury was (is) giving a dex debuff instead of a dex buff. That should be fixed with our next patch (though there is no date set for a patch yet). There were some stacking issues to consider. We've looked them over, and they are working the way they should work. So, yes, it does overwrite some stat buffs and not others. That's the way it's going to stay. Changing anything about the way they stack would undoubtedly cause other stacking issues, and nobody wants that. :)<br><br>Ok, on to the various post snips. Keep in mind that this is sort of a first run through. You're getting my ideas and comments here, not company policy. I'm trying to get my ducks in a row so that I can present cogent ideas to the team. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Icons for group disease and poison buff - when applied, the icon appears exactly the same as if you are poisoned or diseased, would it be possible to tint the icons blue so people know its a buff and not a dot. This also applies for the druid group resist fire and cold.]></i></font> <br><br>Actually, I think a lot of icons probably need to be redone. It's something that I really would like to see get a revamp. But, really, this isn't a Shaman thing, it's something that everyone would probably like. I'm not ignoring this idea, just moving it off this thread and into my want list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Alchemy - 2 things <br><br>1) NPC merchants will only buy back potions for between 9 gold and 2 plat, regardless of the cost to make the potion. Could this be made more in line with jewlry, maybe were merchants can buy back potions for 80 - 90% of the cost. Currently, the cost of practicing is enormious with no chance of profit in the end. I spent 2500 pp to practice the other day, and went from a skill of 50 to 90, to practice above this level will cost between 15pp - 200pp per attempt.]></i></font> <br><br>I'll ask into it. But keep in mind that trade skills are designed to only be profitable when items are sold to players. But if the return isn't at least reasonable when selling to vendors, I'll see if I can find out why. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Currently only SOW potions have any demand at all, and occasionaly gate potions if people can afford them (cheaper to pay a druid or wizard). Could new gate potions be added to the new expansions zones?]></i></font> <br><br>I'll look into it. But my first thought is that Velious is designed to be hard to get to, so that's unlikely. And, well, it might not be the intent of Alchemy to reduce the need to have a wizard or druid to zap you around the globe. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Torpor &#8211; Doesn&#8217;t stack with chloroplast/regrowth, spirit of wolf, Turgur&#8217;s Insects, Ignite Blood, Plague, Celestial Elixer. None of these cases make sense except for SoW. We are not asking for Torpor to cancel DOTs, just stack with them, as well as CE and regen. In addition this spell hardly compares to other class Lvl 60 spells, with only 1200 hp total heal and all the negative effects, feel free to make it useful.]></i></font> <br><br>Well, stacking regens is always going to be very limited. And it makes some sense to me that you can't go into torpor while under a DoT. It's a lot of healing for little mana. It greatly reduces downtime. Personally, I think it's fine as is. But feel free to try to convince me otherwise. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Avatar &#8211; Does not stack with Focus of Spirit and Wolf Form. Even if you want to make some of the components (str for example) not stack please make the overall buff and non-redundant parts of these stack. This is not the main problem however, which is that for 325 mana, a 1 minute duration and a 3 minute recast, with quite questionable benefits (for example this is not anywhere near what 70% haste spells do), shamans do not use this spell at all.]></i></font> <br><br>Again, it seems like a great spell to me. Perhaps others can wade in here and explain to me why this isn't a good spell. Keep in mind that stacking is a very complicated issue. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Talisman of the Serpent &#8211; Most shamans consider this spell nothing less than an insult. Please just remove it. If you are feeling generous replace it with something a little more useful, a group Talisman of Kragg would be OK.]></i></font> <br><br>Not all spells will be 'A' list spells. There's no real reason to remove this spell. Heck, if you're playing with a lot of bards&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Stacking of Curse of Spirits, effect on epic weapon Spear of Fate- Splurt, Choke, Ignite Blood all overwrite it. It does not take on someone with Skin Like Nature series buff on. These are all obviously oversights on your part please correct.]></i></font> <br><br>I'll look into it and see if these are, in fact, oversights or if they are as intended. It's not so obvious to me&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Tigir&#8217;s Insects &#8211; Range of the area effect is pretty darned small. As this spell is so rare most shamans don&#8217;t have it yet to complain about this, but they will.]></i></font> <br><br>Well, there are a fair number of spells with a very small area of effect. It takes a bit of skill to land on a lot of targets, but it can be done. Keep in mind that monsters don&#8217;t have much, er&#8230; volume, so they can be stacked very close together. This doesn't seem like something that needs to be changed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It's pretty obvious from the original spell listing that shamans were designed as a generalist priest class with the following features: <br>1. Buffs far beyond any other class<br>2. Debuffing abilities somewhat better than an enchanter.<br>3. Second-tier healing. Similar to druids in straight heals, with regeneration spells to help.<br>4. Strong, but limited (only two) Damage over Time lines.<br>5. Use of a second-tier pet at higher level<br>6. Slightly better melee skills than the other priests. <br>Sound about right?]></i></font> <br><br>Sounds right to me, for the most part. I have a disagreement with point #2, but I'll get to that in a second. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: On the face, it sounds like a good plan. The realities of play at level 50 had some interesting effects: <br>1. Stats were never implemented in a manner to make stat buffs overly useful. The ratio of their effect to mana expendature make them iffy to use in a lot of circumstances. The lines of buffs that did really matter (AC, HP, melee speed) were done better by clerics, and about equivalently to enchanters.]></i></font> <br><br>And later you mentioned something about buffs not being mana efficient either. Honestly, mana efficiency isn't the end-all and be-all of determining the value of a class. It's a consideration, but it's not the only thing that matters. The ability to do something that is useful might fully overpower the idea that you can't do it efficiently. Tell me if I'm wrong here, but shaman do have the most efficient buffs (with perhaps the noted exception of AC and HP by clerics and attack speed by enchanters). You must be comparing efficiently, I guess, to just blasting things. Keep in mind, though, that blasting things may not always be an option. Buffing the melee types in some cases might be more efficient. <br><br>But I'm willing to accept your comments as they are, even if I might not believe in them as strongly as you do. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. This worked pretty much as planned. Enchanters did most of our abilities at a slightly lower level, and mages could do resist debuffing at a lower level of effectiveness.]></i></font> <br><br>Actually, I had always thought that enchanters were supposed to be the masters of debuffing. For me, the current setup seems just right on this account. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Worked as planned.<br>4. Worked as planned, but got hit by a nerf aimed to stop kiting, which was never our forte anyway.]></i></font> <br><br>Good enough. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. Went okay here. The only real problem was our pet got hit by some changes aimed at reigning in the power of the pets that WERE problematic, namely necro and mage pets.]></i></font> <br>Goodness, pets again! :)<br><br>But, essentially, pets for shaman work as intended, right? They add a bit of damage and tanking, and they look cool. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6. True, but largely irrelevant since at higher levels, necessity really dictates the higher efficiency of medding over melee in most situations, and we were never close in combat effectiveness anyway.]></i></font> <br><br>But not at all irrelevant to those in the level to use it. The ability for a shaman to melee pretty well makes the earlier levels a fairly easy go for them. Again, I think this works out well enough. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So we got hit by a couple nerfs aimed at others, and the "king of buffs" title was both misleading and largely useless, but all in all, it was a good class. What happened with Kunark? Well, look at the spell list as a whole: <br><br>1. We got a TON of buffs. All 5 stats get a bigger version AND all 5 get group versions. About a third of the RoK spell list is buffs.]></i></font> <br><br>I gather you disagree with the continuance of buffs as the main focus of shaman. I think I understand this, and I'll bring it to the team. Don't, however, expect a revamp of all the spells post 50. It's not very likely that we'll be suddenly changing all buffs to DD spells or something wild like that. As you stated, up to 50 shamans are pretty darn great. I'm of the opinion that buffs are part of that greatness. But I think I see what you're getting at. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Nice slow upgrade at 51, with still a slim lead over enchanters, but the Mage Mala line is much closer to our Malo than previously. In fact, from 51 to 59, mages have the same single-target debuff spell as shamans.]></i></font> <br><br>I guess this means that you're ok with the progression, and just upset that magicians have gained that type of spell. I'm not a big fan of the spreading of abilities over classes either. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Worked okay. We got superior heal finally, as well as Regrowth and Torpor (once in its current version) to help. Fizzle rates are insane on superior heal, but the design idea was right.]></i></font> <br><br>All 'secondary' powerful spells like that have a bit more fizzle to them. You're not alone in that. And it is, frankly, just another drawback to the spell. Personally, I'm not sure that shaman should have superior healing&#8230; it's not unlike giving mages Malosi&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. Necros get our prized #1 DoT spell (Envenomed Bolt) at 51, then several upgrades. Druids get two DoT upgrades by 54. Shamans don't get their DoT updates -- and somewhat disappointing ones -- at 56 and 59!]></i></font> <br><br>Confusion! You don't get he upgrades at all, or you're disappointed with them&#8230; <br><br>I looked it up. They seem to be there. In fact, here's what Everlore says about Pox of Bertoxxulous: <br><br>"This is believed to be the best DoT in game. It is the last Shaman DoT, doing close to 2100 damage."<br><br>Not that I hold everything on spoiler sites to be the gospel truth&#8230; :)<br><br>Please, give me some detail as to why these upgrades are disappointing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. The pet upgrade is only minimally better than the 49 pet while hitting a HUGE cost increase. Our second-tier pet actually becomes third-tier as by level 60, Shadowknights have better pets.]></i></font> <br><br>I know&#8230; I know. We're still looking into this one. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Now, as I mentioned, at 50 shamans were a pretty strong class, and it's probably true that a slight cut in overall power relative to the other classes wasn't out of line. But virtually every defining factor of the class was given a terribly minor update, save one. And, in a lot of cases, we were matched or surpassed by other classes in areas we'd been the specialists in.]></i></font> <br><br>I disagree with the minor update thing. And, well, if you agree that shaman were perhaps on the top few rungs at 50, then how else would you suggest we upgrade them? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The one that takes up over a third of our spell list: buffs. <br>It's really puzzling. One gets the feeling that the live team doesn't really quite grasp the role of the shaman in high level play, and although they think they're giving us key improvements in our major areas, we see them as near-worthless toss-ins that add to the pile of low-value spells that take the place that more interesting or useful spells could go. What's more, impinging on our REAL defining abilities by other classes is okay because they're not viewed by the design team as being shaman core abilities.]></i></font> <br><br>It seems that it's worthwhile to have a talk about stat buffs in house. But, well, I'm not convinced that they rate as&#8230; how did you put it&#8230; near-worthless. As for giving out core abilities to other classes, well, I don't like that either. It's always a fine line, though, between making classes playable and keeping things distinct for them as well. This is something that I also want to bring up to the team. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: A prime example of this would be the abilities of the class breastplates. In Kunark, the shaman BP casts a damage shield. This is really puzzling since apart from alchemy, we don't have damage shields, and the damage from it (5 points) is tiny... the real effect is the AC buff it provides. In Velious, the shaman BP casts a stamina buff. While not totally useless, it's hardly what we'd expect, when comparing our effects to say that of clerics (who get Complete Heal and Celestial Elixir).]></i></font> <br><br>I don't want to make this into an item discussion&#8230; I really think those sorts of things are best served in a different thread. But I'll mention this to the team as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'm not talking about the strength of the spells. It's that the clerics (and other casting classes) seem to be getting spells that are central to their function in game -- primary healing. Whereas an ac buff+damage shield and stamina buff seem to say a shaman's primary function is to buff. When it's not true at all -- our primary function is generally to DEBUFF. More appropriate spells would be things like Turgur's Insects, Malosi, or Cripple.]></i></font> <br><br>Well, this seems to be where you and I depart philosophy. Maybe it's just me, I don't know. The damage shield obviously isn't part of your core function as a shaman. But buffing really is. Debuffing is a secondary thing. But, as I've said, I'll talk this over with the team. Contrary to popular belief, we do have people that play shaman on the team&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think this is the primary obstacle between the designers and players -- as far as the players are concerned, shamans just aren't there to buff. We may do it, but it's not why we're needed in the high level game, and it's not our major contribution to the group. With the game mechanics as they are, this is not likely to change. What DOES need re-evaluating is the priority that function is given when designing shaman spell lists and assigning appropriate effects to class-specific items.]></i></font> <br><br>Again, perhaps&#8230; Buffing is certainly something that is a primary focus at lower levels. Obviously, as you've stated, you think that focus changes post 50. And, again, I'll talk to the team about it. <br><br>Wow. I'm sorry this thing ran so long. I'm just probing for ideas and clarifications, and letting you know where I stand and what I think. Feel free to try to change my mind. It doesn't really seem that, reading over all the threads, there is all that much that you're unhappy with. I guess I'm a bit shocked to see so many posts about shamans lately&#8230; <br><br>Alan</i></UL>

Alan had a busy day on the forums.  Here's the latest from him:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042002.html"><b>Having Three Bags Open at Once</b></a><br>Unfortunately, and oddly enough, it's not likely that we'll be able to make it so that you can open more than two bags. Rowyl already answered this, and essentially it's a programming nightmare. Obviously anything can be done with enough work, but this one isn't likely to happen. With the time required to change it, Rowyl could probably raise the Titanic&#8230; :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041958.html"><b>Ayonae Ro</b></a><br>Ayonae Ro is the ruler of the Realm of Music. <br><br>Don't you dare ask me to pronounce the name. I still officially mis-pronounce Tanarus...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041986.html"><b>On Enchanter Illusions</b></a><br>Pretty much, no. <br><br>There is as near to no chance that enchanters will ever be getting any spell that increases their foot speed as you could imagine. This is one of those signature abilities for other classes that we are very reluctant to give to other classes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041494-2.html"><b>Lure Spells</b></a><br>Monoriu wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:&#8221;What is the effectiveness of my lure spells after tonights patch, as compared to, say, 2 months ago? <br>A simple answer will do. <br><br>Also, I strongly suggest that you change your name to blue. This will increase your credibility 100 fold. <br><br>Thanks&#8221; ]></i></font><br><br>Well, he doesn&#8217;t post much, so that&#8217;s probably why his name is not blue. I can get that fixed if he plans to post more. Uzun is the server-side programmer. Basically, if anyone knows how this thing works, he's the guy. What happened was that Gordon and Roger talked it over, and it seems that Gordon made an error. <br><br>I messed up my own password yesterday and haven&#8217;t been able to post (in fact, I&#8217;m typing a bunch of replies to post when I get it fixed.) <br><br>It will be the same as it is now. This patch will make no changes to Lure. <br><br>But about three weeks ago monster saves were changed somewhat, so that they would resist the right kinds of Lures the right way. So, perhaps a fire breathing foe will now resist fire Lures a bit better. But it&#8217;s resistance to cold Lures wouldn&#8217;t have changed. The idea is, now you actually have to use the right Lure on certain monsters... <br><br>And that change was made a few weeks ago. There will be no change with this current patch. <br><br>I probably should have figured this out earlier and let you all know. But I was having trouble understanding the change. The lack of notification is primarily my fault. I&#8217;m sorry.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041855.html"><b>Items Nerfed</b></a><br>Gravedirt wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "VI should NEVER had put these effects on these items in the first place, they'd have saved themselves a LOT of grief at this point."]></i></font> <br><br>That's pretty much the truth of it. <br><br>Some of the items that we've given right-click effects are too powerful. This breastplate was one of them. I find it a bit surprising that most of you are suggesting that it was not too powerful. <br><br>I'm sorry that we had to change the casting time on it. But the item was plainly overpowered, and it needed to be changed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041951.html"><b>Verant Let Too Many Switch Servers?</b></a><br>You can create characters on the new server.

There were six or seven of us in the room when that conversation was going on, so I can see how Lum might have confused that. I gotta make sure you give credit where it's due.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041473.html"><b>"Did Verant hire a South Park artist?"</b></a><br>Oddly enough, I think a saw someone working on that animation recently... <br><br>Though I disagree about the graphic, I think the direwolf looks awesome.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041484.html"><b>EverQuest.com Poll</b></a><br>Absolutely, positively, just a poll. <br><br>I don&#8217;t think anyone on the dev team is even aware that there is a poll...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040590-3.html"><b>Shaman & Locked Threads</b></a><br>Piercey wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "A.the topic is under discussion and being looked at;or B.for reasons of balance/gameplay etc We do not feel an adjustment to to the Shaman pet is warranted."]></i></font> <br><br>To sum this up in short order, the answer is both A and B. <br><br>I asked about this pet at the last tuning meeting. We talked about it a bit (it was an old issue to everyone, but they went over the discussion again). And it was, again, decided that the pet is pretty much how it was intended to be. It's a very mild upgrade to the previous pet, and some will still use the old one. And that seems to be how it will remain. <br><br>I'll try to tackle the other Shaman concerns tomorrow.

Alan summed up the situation with Lure spells in the following <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041945.html">message he posted</a> on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>I just wanted to summarize what is happening and what has happened with Lure spells (hopefully I understand it).<br><br>Three weeks ago, the resist rates for NPCs in regards to Lure was fixed. This means, basically, that they will resist Lures that they are supposed to resists (a fire creature might now resist a fire-based Lure that it did not resist before). This change really shouldn't have affected most wizards, once they realized the change and adjusted tactics accordingly. It is my fault for not informing you of the change. For that I'm sorry.<br><br>However, all the talk about changes to this line of spells brought about a more in-depth look at how they work, leading to this post by one of our programmers (given in full here for your enjoyment):<br><br>"After looking closely at the way saves are done when the target is higher level than the caster, it appears that Lures would get saving throws in situations where they should not. I'm fixing it now, it should go on test shortly. <br><br>So to make everyone happy, the target of a lure spell will NOT get a saving throw addition if it's higher level than the caster. I thought this already was the case, it was not. <br><br>Currently on live some NPCs are getting saves versus lures that they should not be getting."<br><br>This change, however, will not take effect until we patch next. With the holidays on us, it's hard to tell when that will be.<br><br>So, over all, Lure should actually become a more powerful line of spells, for those that are fully aware of their proper use&#8230;<br><br>Alan</I></UL>

Verant's Unzun <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041494.html">made an announcement</a> concerning the Lure series of spells on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>There is a nasty rumour floating around that something will be changed in the overall way that NPCs save against the Lure series of spells this upcoming patch. This is NOT true. Lure saves at one time were SUPPOSED to be like lifetap saves, but this did not happen. They are currently more like Dragon Breath saves, which is better for the caster, worse for the target. They will CONTINUE to be that way!<br>About 3 weeks ago dragon breath saves were adjusted, and that resulted in some few NPCS saving SLIGHTLY better saves vs certain lures, but this change happened about a month ago on test, 3 weeks ago on live, and lures will continue to work as dragon breath type saves, that will not change.<br><br>In an irc chat it was incorrectly stated, that Lures would be treated as lifetap saves, let me repeat, this is NOT true. Lures are treated as Dragon breath type saves both before and after tonights patch.</i></UL>

Along with Patch Day comes a new Patch Message and today is no exception:<UL>December 19th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Today's patch primarily consists of tuning of Velious zones as well as content and other additions.  In addition, the following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<br><br>- High-end items that have a activatable (right-click) healing effect have in several cases had their casting times increased.  <br>- Factions for some of the higher end encounters in Velious have received some adjustments.  Basically, "bad acts" receive more weight than "good acts".  For instance, if "A" hates "B" and "B" hates "A", killing "A" will hurt your faction with "A" more than it will help your faction with "B".<br>- The stamina reduction with "Resurrection Effects" has been replaced by a slight attack-speed debuff.<br>- The Ranger's Trueshot discipline now works correctly.  It was previously only working versus other player characters.<br>- The Shadow Knight's "Unholy Aura" discipline has received an enhancement.  When in use, harmtouch resistances will be checked versus disease instead of magic.  In addition, harmtouch will resist in the same fashion as lifetap spells, meaning that unless the creature is immune to disease, you should get full damage most of the time.<br>- The spell attached to the "Fiery Defender" can now be partially resisted instead of being "all or nothing".  The net result is that the average damage will be higher.<br>- The Paladin "Holy Forge" discipline will now give paladins triple the normal chance of scoring a critical hit.  Each critical hit has a percent chance to be scored as a critical blow.<br>- Added parameters to the /camp command (the command that will cause you to camp out if you are already sitting).  "/camp server" will take you back to the server selection screen.  "/camp desktop" will take you out to the desktop following a successful camp.  Despite popular request, "/camp spawn" will not be implemented.<br>- Walruses now indeed sound like they should.<br>- Added the /chatfontsize [0 to 5] (default is 1) command.  This command will allow players to adjust the size of the font in the chat window.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>
