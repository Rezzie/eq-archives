I know that there were a number of people on Vallon Zek that were interested in escaping the cross teaming that was occurring between the light and dark races (see guilds such as Prophets), and these are the people that are most disappointed with the decision.  But, after looking at the numbers, I would have to agree that it may not be the best idea to combine the servers, and those of us concerned with the cross teaming of dark and lights (this was never the intent of a team PvP server) will have to police such guilds as we can.  Thanks for putting it up to a vote, and bring on the coin loot only.<br><br>Meghann Treewhisperer<br>Officer of Code of Honor<br>Vallon Zek<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Disappointed end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Sony/Verant are completely out of touch with their client base. For this reason im boycotting any SonyVerant games forever and suggest all real heroes leave this company and the cowards who remain to their own pathetic ways. here are my reasons:<br>1) Verant asked one question, and interpreted a completely different answer. Asking who wants to move is not the same asking who wants no loot.<br>2)Verant can NEVER be TRUSTED again. they change the server loot rules in the mid stream. And they arnt doing what they said they would, move ppl who wanted out of the server out. This Co. isnt smart enough to know some of the real reasons ppl wanted out...Prophets<br>3) this company is to LAZY to do what they said they would, and is taking the easy way out. this is a bad sign ppl.<br>4) this company is not bright enough, or is to cheap to figure out the best way to so this, which is: BUY another server, put the ppl who wanted to move in it. this leaves VZ the pure team pvp server it is, and satisfies EVERYONE.the ppl who want to move are moved and with friends; the ppl who want a loot server still will have one. it boils down to one thing ppl, Verant doesnt care about ALL its clients. SAD.<br>5)The ppl on VZ who would remain would be the ones staying,plus the ones from TZ who want over here. We pure team pvp players dont care how many are left, we just want it the way it is...and if verant thinks the population is too small, we dont care, we want our loot server. And the population will grow.<br>6) verant could just move the smallest amount of ppl, the ones wanting loot, on to the new server if they want to do it the fastest, easiest way. <br>7) or could just move the prophets and the 4way xteams guilds to one server..everyone would love this, the ones who want away from 4xteams, and prophets; who hate everyone and would be happy to be alone and have a server all to themselves.<br><br>i could go on and on with brilliant solutions. but im afraid they would all require some work or expense by verant, and we know how lazy and cheap verant is; and how little they really care for ALL of their clientle. the proof of this is in the statement above by verant.<br>  <!--ktalk end_comment-->

Like your &quot;boycotting&quot; their products forever is going to affect their buisness. It won't. This is EXTREMELY reasonable on the part of Verant. Would it make sense to have a server with 4000 people and one with 200? Nope. God your a whiner. &quot;They are never to be trusted again.&quot; Sheesh, you people that do complain take things way out of context. If your not happy on your server, why don't you move to the other one? Oh crap, I forgot, you might have to START OVER, or FIND A NEW GUILD. Gosh, that'd just be torture, now wouldn't it? In closing, haha, Verant has very good buisness practicies, and whiners like you will have no affect on their buisness. Boycott...sheesh, that's the funniest thing I've seen all day, and I just got done watching Dead Alive!<br><br>-BlackJack Ace II<!--ktalk end_comment-->

The majority rules in this, its just business sense. And NO Verant will not lose massive business, and NO there will be no great revolt, NO throwing down of the government, NO comming of the anti-christ. Just because you and a few hundred other people leave will probably only improve the game for the rest of us.<br><br>Whats wrong? Not being able to steal just that ONE item per kill from other players just RUINS the game for you? I agree with that guy who posted above, cancel you account and wait for UO2, the second comming of the land of kewl d00ds.

As my computer instructor always told me, GIGO.  (computer guys know what I mean).  The largest consortium of dark on the server (xanit and blacksun) stated they were moving NOT because of Item Loot, but because of Cross teaming.  The largest lighty guild (Old defiant) stated the same thing.  Sooooo.....if so many were leaving valon to escape crossteaming, how could anyone in their right mind decide changing it to Coin Only loot was the right fix?  Hello?  <br><br>Changing the crossteaming system would seem to be the logical change.  But alas, that would be too much work.  So once again, Verant makes the easy decision, based on faulty data.  <!--ktalk end_comment-->

This issue would never have came up if the player switching option was not offered in the first place. I seems likely that the players who want to move have reaped the advantages ot item loot and want to use the gain to tweek their other players.  Imagine the effects of changing to coin only.  Everyone with 50+ char. makes a new char. and tweeks that char. with prevously looted items making a lvl 1 supper tweek who can only be touched by other such tweeks.  How could a hard working player have a chance.  This would continue Verdant/Sony's trend of supporting high levels and leaving low levels to fend for themselves.  I have never played on anyother server, I think that I would leave EQ as quickly as i left Dioblo, Underlight, and starcraft.....all games without the chalenge and risk or coin + item loot.  <!--ktalk end_comment-->

I played a Ranger on Vallon until I couldnt take the unfair loot policy anymore.  I jumped at the chance to move, so I could play this game again.  Apparently so did almost everyone.  Why OVERLOAD Tallon and leave Vallon practically empty except for a few PK Brats who might actually have to earn their stuff now... Its obvious that the vast majority want Coin loot.  Its the most logical solution to fit the EQ system.  Not very many people are concerned about the crossteaming, its the loot system that makes Vallon so bad, and that is what must be changed.  Unfortunately the PK sect is one of the most vocal so it may APPEAR that a lot of people are upset about this, but dont be fooled Verant, your doing the right thing.  Most of the other posts in here are blathering spouts of illogical ranting... &quot;Im gonna quit!  Waaaa!&quot;  C'mon people idle threats arent going to help anything and just make you look juvenille.  Im SO glad Verant doesn't attempt to abide by the demands of the 'Im gonna quit' crowd or just imagine how horrible this game would be.  They almost always do what is best for the game.

The game has sucked many hours of my life from me.   Thats a good thing.  Anyway, I have charicters on a few servers... some with bad economys, some with good ones.   People on some servers were nicer then some people on other servers.  In any case I didnt know about PVP servers  (Where have I been)  I read up on the concept and decided it would be an interesting expariment to start a char on coin loot. I made it to a mid range level and realized that the coin loot was a but to little of a reward.  I made a NEW char on the coin/item loot server and I loved the.  The rewards were so much greater and the new risk was much more exciting.  Another point to put fourth.  People who are on the coin/item loot server came to that server by choise.   I know that the majority of those people want to move but they can do that without your help verent.   They can do what I and many others did and would do again. They can start a NEW charicter on the other server.  By telling them that sure they will complain about not wanting to move but they also have the option.   Once they get going on the other server they will stop complaining and they will be happy because they will be doing what they wanted to do.  That is they will be playing on a coin loot only server.   Unlike those people, changing the loot rules inflicts a lack of options in that we are deprived of out origonal choice to be in a coin/item loot situation.  We loose the option.  We loose the choice to determin what kind of playing environment we exist in.  This is not right.   Verent... if you must change the rulse then do so but I encourage you to please concider alternitives for all of us who do not wish a change to take place.  Please just think about other ways and/or methods that can be used to satisfy all and everyone.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

To have a lot of people transfer over to the other server (and you deal with the overcrowding),  or leave the servers as is (no changes at all) or change it to coin only.

If cross-teaming is such a major problem (and it certainly goes against the design intent of the team servers) then perhaps a solution can be coded to fix that. Unlike Rallos, Verant actually put some thought into the team servers (long ago) and I'd think they'd want to at least try and maintain the concept without being forced to reduce risk because of cross-teaming. Everyone on VZ CHOSE the rules they are playing under, whether they currently wish to move their characters and loot to a lower risk server or not.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I can't believe I just read some of that.<br><br>First, I agree that the Customer Service staff is seriously out of touch with the players. I think that the Verant policy of removing any member of said staff that IS in touch with the players or accessible at all is to blame for that. THAT certainly needs to be addressed.<br><br>As for some of the rest of that....<br><br>Much as it pains me to do this, I'm actually gonna have to defend the Prophets. THEY'RE NOT THE PROBLEM HERE. The problem is essentially the looting rules. Some people just don't like to risk loosing that shiny new whatever it is after all the trouble they went to to get it. And to those people I say &quot;you knew the rules when you started here, if you don't like it, feel free to start again somewhere else.&quot; I know, I know, it means (*gasp*) starting a new character, but this is a GAME, and that's part of the fun *Grin* Come on now, there's a certain entertainment in running for your life from a decaying skeleton. There's no need to change the loot rules for VZ, or even switch people. <br><br>I agree fully that there are some guilds (Prophets most notably, but also Da Bashin Iggles and Reapers) that make life difficult, but there are options other than leaving. Hey, you can use some of that vast untapped roleplaying potential to DO SOMETHING about them (as Cymbrogii does and Defiant used to) rather than whining like children about it. It's a PVP after all....just kill them, or see them killed if you can't do it personally. In all honesty, that's sort of the POINT Of PvP isn't it? <br><br>As for Prophets in particular, I'd rather deal with them than some other guilds....Iggles for SURE and Reapers too. Hell, the VAST majority of the server isn't in their level range anyways, so what are THEY complaining about? Last I checked they were essentially ALL over 50....which makes about 75% or more of the server totally safe from them. So those of you high enough to have a problem with them now (not just holding on to old grudges) go out an cry havok and let cry the dogs of war.  The rest of you SHUT UP! Frankly, I'd rather deal with Prophets than Iggles or Reapers. I've never actually seen the Prophets cheat, which is more than I can say for some other guilds. Also half of them don't even item loot, they just kill you for entertainment *Grin* Besides all that, they're (in my experience with them at least) at least more polite that some others. *shrug* I've never had one of them kill me and then start name calling, etc. Heck, I've had them help me out with things, just to be helpful. That's my official 2cp *Grin*<br><br>*shrug*<br>Let the flames begin<!--ktalk end_comment-->

EVERYONE that joined VZ/TZ in the begining joined KNOWING it was a coin +1 -8/+8. IT WAS OUR CHOICE TO BE HERE AS A WHOLE. NO ONE was forced to join this server and follow the coin +1 -8/+8 rules. To have had that choice in the begning is as fair as it gets. For you to NOT give us a choice now, and I MEAN EACH and everyone of us, is ridiculous.<br><br>Varent, you took from TZ without asking, DO NOT take from VZ. Hold true to your promises. Which in this case was the PROMISE of a PvP server with coin +1 with -8/+8. I left RZ for this server because it was coin +1, WITH THE bonus of -8/+8 rather than -4/+4 like on RZ. I knew what this server was going to be, I knew it because you promised it to be so. I trusted you then, I want to trust you now. KEEP your word, Coin +1 -8/+8 for VZ.  <br><br>If you would like a solution...<br><br>THE MAJORITY seem to whine about X-teaming. They want to fight the Prophets they say, but they say they can not because of immortal healers(which is BS, the truth of the matter is that 95% of the Prophets are 50+, with most of the prophets being level 55ish, and most of the server is too low of a level to fight the prophets.). So what do you do? <br><br>Ask if people want VZ to become all out PVP. Then EVERYONE can kill EVERYONE. Leave it -8/+8. This coin only crap will be forgotten fast. AS WELL, no one will cry about immortal healers (Except for the TRUE immortal healers on the server, and we all know those are, those level 39 clerics with complete heal that are too low for level 47+ to kill.). <br><br>There's a solution to the reason people are saying they want to move. Give the &quot;majority&quot; what they &quot;say&quot; they want. Give them all you can Verent. Give them the ability to fight the Prophets. Then you will have done your part Verent. The rest will be up to the server to gain 10 or so levels so they can start PvPing against the Prophets.<br><br>Drizzlin De'vir<br>Rogue of the 53rd Season<br>Vallen Zek<br>Coin +1 -8/+8 proactivist <!--ktalk end_comment-->

To have had that choice in the begning is as fair as it gets. For you to NOT give us a choice now, and I MEAN EACH and everyone of us, is ridiculous.<br><br>Varent, you took from TZ without asking, DO NOT take from VZ. Hold true to your promises. Which in this case was the PROMISE of a PvP server with coin +1 with -8/+8. I left RZ for this server because it was coin +1, WITH THE bonus of -8/+8 rather than -4/+4 like on RZ. I knew what this server was going to be, I knew it because you promised it to be so. I trusted you then, I want to trust you now.

They want to fight the Prophets they say, but they say they can not because of immortal healers(which is BS, the truth of the matter is that 95% of the Prophets are 50+, with most of the prophets being level 55ish, and most of the server is too low of a level to fight the prophets.). So what do you do? <br><br>Ask if people want VZ to become all out PVP. Then EVERYONE can kill EVERYONE. Leave it -8/+8. This coin only crap will be forgotten fast.

Many of you don't want to believe this *he says sarcastically* but there are those looking to find an exploit just to be able to screw the rest of you.  They don't care about what it takes to get to 60 and bend all of you over and abuse you.  These are the types of people who will find a way given any circumstance to break the spirit of the rules.  There is nothing that can be done to tweak the system to stop every exploit.  There are not enough GM's to stop this type of action.  It happens in all games.  Hell, it happens everyday in real life.  So because of these idiots the rest of us suffer.  If there was a solution it would be to ban their accounts altogether.  That won't happen either so you might as well go to a blue server where the exploiters are at least slowed in their efforts.  This just goes to show what people will do when there are no real rules.  So many cheats and liars.  No humanity.  Animals of the jungle.  Sure they will justify their actions by saying that they were pked unfairly so they developed their own &quot;strategy&quot;.  This is what you all get that want to PK in the least.  You reap what you have sown.  <!--ktalk end_comment-->

So now everyone is stuck together and i have a feeling after this is over that your going to see a lot of peeps quit the game... I never wanted to end the game like this,  i wanted to be lv60 and quit when i felt the time had come,  messing around with your costomers like puppets will get verant nowhere, NOTHING ever needed to be changed in the first place,  Looks like the whiners and beggers are going to win the war,  *sighs*  to all that know what the B.F.Y. is ,  you know who it goes out to,  my last post til you MAKE UP YOUR MIND,  btw casters WAKE UP&lt;  how are enchanters going to do anything in pvp,  everyone will be sporting there froglock crowns,  diamond mask ect. ect.  resist gear will be out of hand,  being a wizard i won't have fun fighting a tank with his/her FBSS,  that he/she can wear to the death,  yeah right i gotta chance,  wizards are supposed to be the most powerful,  i once felt that power and it looks like im going to lose it,  THINK and DON'T CHANGE SOMETHING THAT MADE THIS SERVER MORE ORGINAL THAN ALL OTHERS&lt;  PLENTY OF PEEPS CAME HERE FROM OTHER SERVERS,  just because peeps don't like it don't give in because they whine,  if they didn't like the loot of people on this server they could have started a new account at quit this server long ago,  why the hell did you guys level up to 50 whining the whole way?!?!?!?!?  deal with it ,  last post ... the B.F.Y.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I was pleased that you allowed the move for the sake of others, I had no intetion from moving off VZ, except for maybe a useless character to see what it was like -<br><br>And there perhaps is a good point... how many moved to 'SEE' what it was like, with a relatively unformed character (which is still better than grabbing a newbie on TZ) - if one of my character moves had been considered as a validation of the coin-only, I would have been very upset. Or perhaps they moved twinked characters over.  This is not necessarily about COIN-ONLY.  <br><br>YOU INSTITUTED A DAMN POLLING MECHANISM IN THE SOFTWARE, SO USE IT DAMN IT - IT MAKES ME REALLY ANGRY THAT YOU'RE BEHAVING SO ATROCIOUSLY IN THIS SITUATION.<br><br>Just, please, cut the crap.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email aneiric@smig.net end_email start_name Aneiric &lt;420&gt; end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment--><br><br>  After reading all these posts i have so much to say i cant think.  I woke up at 8am the other morning cause i couldnt sleep after thinking they were going to change it to coin only..i havent even logged on much since this whole /movelog bullshit started.  I moved from Karana server right when this Teams PVP stuff all started, for the reason of PvP AND for the chance to be looted or to loot, OR to gain respect from people if u dont loot..the last fun time i had in EQ was two weeks ago when my good RL friend Deneir logged on and we went out pking...we wear somethign in every slot so we arent called naked lamers..we took out 4 respectable DE's, didnt loot any of them to show our respect for their couragous efforts...but then there are people like Iggles , a few prophets that attack US, that we feel we have to loot and its FUN.  Ive played this game about 105days, 70 on VZ , im a 51 rogue &lt;still&gt;, pvp is pretty challenging for me and basically the rogue life in general is, and man just think right when u guys decide to make the rogues a little more needed and better, new posions ect ect, im going to have to quit because my fun is runed, and yes for people that are saying YAH to the naked lamers, dont u think about the 50+'s that get attacked by players that have somethign on them and if u win u have a nice present for you to loot when your done...do u think they would attack me if they cant loot me or would deneir and i go out to have some good pking fun if there is NO chance of loot , HELL NO...i was so looking forward to seeing all the new rogue things, but i guess ill have to play another game since u cant keep one friggin server at REAL PVP standards...what in gods name am i going to do with all my good shit ??? my two peices of rubicite ect ect, i always wanted before i quit the game on MY choice to wear it around pking till i lost both peices then quit, but shit now im going to destroy it all , all my shit, and god just to imagine all the hrs i spent picking them friggin doors in unrest to get my skill to 201 what a WASTE...some of u may like coin only , lots dont, but think if the question was...&quot;Do you want coin only&quot; instead of to &quot;move&quot;, i bet the numbers would be totally different..i could go on for ever but i wont , u probably wont even read past the 10th message anyways and u guys are just to lazy and cheap to just give all those 2100 people from VZ a new server and let the about 500 people that wanted to come to VZ , come.<br><br>Later all , maybe forever<br>Aneiric <br>51 rake<br>High Plane Drifters<br><br><br><!--ktalk end_comment-->
