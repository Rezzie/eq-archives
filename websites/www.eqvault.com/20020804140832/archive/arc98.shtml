<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
An event was just announced by Kallel of the Bristlebane server:<BLOCKQUOTE>Back by popular demand, Sanguine Blade will be hosting another all rogue tournament open to all rogues of the Bristlebane server.<br><br>The Time: It will be held on Sunday, July 9th at 3:00pm CST.<br><br>The Place: Since it will be all one-on-one competition, the location of this tourney will be Najena. We will simply use /duel for each bout. A few advantages to this is that there will be no outside interference like there would be in an arena, its a fairly low populated zone, so lag should be at a minimum, and the room where the event will take place is large enough to accommodate good wide open dueling. For lower levels, higher ups will keep the mobs at bay so as not to interfere in bouts near the entry. Higher ups can use the dungeon to their benefit as they see fit in between their duels. I think it'll be more fun than just standing face to face in an arena.<br><br>The Details: We will be setting up brackets like we did at our last tournament in Befallen by level: <br><br>Bracket: Entrance Fee:<br><br>Snatcher <br>lvl 10-15 3p <br><br>Filcher <br>lvl 16-21 5p <br><br>Burglar <br>lvl 22-26 10p <br><br>Crook <br>lvl 27-29 15p <br><br>Snitch <br>lvl 30-33 20p <br><br>Bandit <br>lvl 34-37 25p <br><br>Thief <br>lvl 38-41 30p <br><br>Ring leader <br>lvl 42-44 35p <br><br>Masterthief <br>lvl 45-47 40p <br><br>Mastermind <br>lvl 48-50 50p <br><br>And the NEW bracket:<br>Nightlord<br>lvl 51-60 65p<br><br>Prizes will be 100% of all the entrance fees in the bracket. For the lower 5 brackets, there will be a choice of a few items out of guild inventory that can be taken as a prize in place of 50% of the purse. (Would like to offer prize instead for all brackets, but we don't really have anything in inventory that would interest a lvl 40+ rogue) <br><br>The rules of combat are as follows: <br><br>1. Fight naked <br>- allowed to wear 2 pieces of equipment per lvl difference to compensate higher ATK, HP, AC of higher lvl's of same bracket.<br><br>2. FS weapons only <br>- this is to avoid exp loss with dot type proc'ing weapons, and advantages of special weapons.<br><br>3. Range weapons are allowed.<br><br>4. Shield allowed: for those who prefer shield versus weapon in secondary slot.<br><br>5. Bandages allowed <br><br>6. No buffs <br><br>7. No magic healing during combat. <br><br>8. Poison - allowed to be used with the exception of DoT poisons like Snake and Putrid Bane. (Burglar bracket and up ONLY)<br><br>These rules will ensure the winner relies on combat skills, instead of better equipment. Anyone found to be dueling outside these rules will forfeit their match.<br><br>The guild will provide a choice of FS weapons to combatants. However, each is responsible for bringing their own bandages and range weapons should they choose to employ them.<br><br>Pairings will be set randomly by the event organizers with winners advancing to the next round. <br><br>This tournament is open to non-guild rogues as well. Please spread the word to your rogue friends throughout Norrath.<br><br><a href="mailto:kallel@mail.com">Registration for the tournement</a> is required. Simply click on the above text and send your name and what bracket you believe you will be fighting in at tourney time, to myself via e-mail. Depending on the way the individual brackets are filled, walk-ons MAY NOT be accepted into the tournament.<br><br>Kallel Frostreaver<br>Minister of Events - Sanguine Blade<br>Ring Warden - Bristlebane Server </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon was busy on the Gameplay Board today as always.  Here's the latest from him:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057949.html"><b>Level 53+ Players</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Verant don't give a rats @SS about 53+ players]</i></font> <br><br>Yes we do. Of course we also care about 52- players as well. This is a case where the needs and desires of one group are directly contrary to that of another group. Our decision will in any case be bound to upset someone. <br><br>Leaving Vox/Nagafen as they were would sooner or later (if it hadn't already) require someone to be level 60, or at least in a guild with a bunch of level 60s in order to participate in raids upon them. At least this way, the lower-level folk still have a chance. As I mentioned in another thread, I've seen multiple reports of people being invited on Dragon runs just because they happened to be on the server at the time and another body was needed. We didn't hear too much of that before.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057968.html"><b>"Could you comment on existing poisons (i.e. asp poison) reduced in damage?"</b></a><br>The old poisons themselves haven't been changed, though that is the effect. <br><br>What did happen was that a fix was implemented for an existing problem. Previously, poisons would do their damage based off of the level of the rogue using them. Now, they do their damage based off of the level (e.g. strength) of the poison. <br><br>When poison was revamped in this patch, that effect was applied to all existing poisons as well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057978.html"><b>Unannounced Nerf: NPCs</b></a><br>Well we generally don't announce changes to individual NPCs, much less when we increase the combat skills of a merchant, but seriously, this guy was being used as a practice dummy.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057927.html"><b>Karana/Bertoxxulous Split Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think this has been answered before, but I can't remember-when we execute the /movelog command, does it automatically register all characters you have on that server, or do you have to log on each character and execute the command?]</i></font> <br><br>All characters on the account are covered by the registration of one /movelog for the account. People with multiple accounts will need to log in one character from each account to register should they want to move.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057940.html"><b>Posion Upgrade</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My 40 INJECTED POISONS (~250 damage DoT) that I had saved in the bank waiting for our 'infamous' patch have been nerfed to the introductory version I (~65 damage DoT).]</i></font> <br><br>The old poisons themselves haven't been changed. What did happen was that a fix was implemented for a problem, of which old poisons were affected. Previously, poisons would do their damage based off of the level of the rogue using them. Now, they do their damage based off of the level (e.g. strength) of the poison. <br><br>When poison was revamped in this patch, that effect was applied to all existing poisons as well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057674.html"><b>Why only two servers for a transfer at a time?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But the newer transfer servers peak at 1000 players.]</i></font> <br><br>That's because the number of people that we transfer is a bit of a guessing game. The purpose of the transfers is to fix a problem. That problem is: Overcrowding at peak hours. To fix this problem, we must move peak population from the crowded server to the new server. However, there's no metric that we can use to define "a peak player". <br><br>Regardless when we open registration for the move, there are always people who don't play at peak who want to be included in the move. Overall, this is expected and is actually necessary, since if this didn't happen, new split-servers would be near-vacant in the off hours. However the percentage of those moved that are represented in peak vs. off-peak varies. <br><br>We got the best percentage of peak players when we did the first split. This was because we didn't preannounce when registration would be, and just broadcast on the server during peak hours. Though this led to a much higher percentage being moved at peak, it did upset a number of customers, which is why we moved to announcing it a couple of days in advance. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When transfer servers come online to elevate crowding why are they only open to two established servers?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, in the first split we did only one. Subsequent splits all used two servers. The reason that we limit the number of "source" servers is that we need to accomplish an identifiable goal in the move, meaning that we have to fix crowding on the source servers. For every server that we open to the split, we dilute the possible effect. For instance, if we take 1000 people off of each of two servers, and that reduces peak load by 300 on each of those servers, the change is noticible. However, if we open it up to 4 servers, we can only take 500 from each, reducing peak load by a mere 150, which wouldn't affect peak populations to the same extreme, and thus have a lesser chance of fulfilling the original goal of the split.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057737-2.html"><b>Rogues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Well lets count this off now. A Rogue thats one spot]</i></font> <br><br>If going someplace that you must get behind locked doors, sure. Of course, the rogue is a fantastic group member in my opinion regardless what is to be encountered that day. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ok now you need to keep that group alive. Well shoot gotta have a cleric for that I suppose]</i></font> <br><br>Considering that people in the "death penalty is too severe" threads cite that clerics are sometimes hard to find, it sounds like groups are getting by with other classes that can heal. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What about crowd control you say? Ahh the enchanter class comes into the group for that.]</i></font> <br><br>For the best crowd control, perhaps. Other classes can also fill the role to varying degrees. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And if its a bad area you need a puller, plus another damage dealer wouldnt be a bad idea. Go get a monk for that. So now a possible 5th slot gone.]</i></font> <br><br>I dislike the idea of "pulling", particularly feign-pulling, so I won't comment on this one. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So now whats left? Well my basic math skills say that we have 1 to 2 slots left for 6 to 7 other classes. You are forcing the gruops to have the first four classes, and totally shorting any of the others.]</i></font> <br><br>With 14 classes, and only 6 slots in a group, not everyone can be in the first 6 choices of every group for every situation. There are other classes that have the ability to fulfill the roles you speak of to various extents. I've seen all-hybrid groups kick some serious tail. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Do I feel that Rogues dont belong in groups? No not at all.

Actually there was nearly a 1000 vote difference in favor of the current arrangement, but with over 180K votes total, that's well within the margin of error. This wasn't quite what we were expecting. <br><br>On the other hand, we've been hearing some good reports from the servers about the change. People who had never been on dragon runs, even ones not associated with guilds, have contacted and asked to go on dragon runs. In one case that I heard, a mid-30s cleric was invited along because they needed some extra healing power. <br><br>We're still keeping this matter open until we see how it plays out in game.

The messages themselves do have a function in the server community, and provide a good way to "break the ice" so to speak. It's not unusual for people dueling to get /tells of congratulations and such from others in the game. <br><br>It might be prudent to mention though that "showoff duels" (Duels between inappropriately named characters) can be considered a disruption of other's gameplay and could very well result in action upon your account.</UL>

Gordon Wrinn made the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057923.html">following post</a> on the Gameplay Board concerning Spell Drops:<UL><i>Hello all, <br><br>I've noticed a number of threads here talking about spell-drops in certain areas of the game, and I thought I'd clear up a few misconceptions.<br><br>1. The chances of getting a spell are higher in some zones than others. Some zones (Karnor's comes to mind) don't have spells because there's enough loot there already.<br>2. Spell-drop chances are not completely random. In other words, you may have to go to several different zones to get all of your spells.<br>3. Not all spell drops are on the "random" tables. What I mean here is that sitting at a dungeon enterace or exit and pulling from the closest room will not guarantee that you get all of the spells in the zone/dungeon sooner or later. You might have to venture in further.<br><br>I hope this might clear up some of the ideas about spells out there. If anyone has any other questions or concerns, please post in this thread and I'll see if I can address your issue.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon Wrinn <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057938.html">cleared up a few misconceptions</a> about the posion upgrade on the Gameplay Board today.  Here's what he said:<UL><i>The "system" of poison itself wasn't changed, and I apologize if people out there thought that it would be. What there is is a greater variety of poisons, which are cheaper, and have more plentiful components. I've gotten a number of emails today asking various quesitons:<br><br>Q: Why aren't the poisons themselves stackable.<br>A: The item system does not allow items with effects to be stackable. Alcohol doesn't apply, as it's covered with item-specific code. We cannot feasibly add item-specific code for poisons and potions due to technical concerns.<br><br>Q: Why don't poisons have multiple charges?<br>A: This is a function of the item engine again. They cannot have multiple charges.<br><br>Q: Why don't poisons last through zoning?<br>A: The game engine doesn't allow it, and spell-code doesn't apply. <br><br>Q: Why do poisons take time to apply?<br>A: Balance. It's necessary for it to take time so that the effects aren't used multiple times in the same combat encounter without stepping out of combat. Poisons are meant as a pre-combat preparation. Keep in mind that rogues are extremely powerful as it is. <br><br>Q: Why can poisons be interrupted? <br>A: Game engine again. To be honest, I'd like to see the chances of this reduced significantly. I'll look into seeing what we can do.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

I received the following from Sunray:<BLOCKQUOTE>Run Across Norrath: Ruis Saille<br> <br>Come one come all this Sunday the 2nd at 3PM Pacific for the Run Across Norrath. Ruis Saille will host yet another day of teaching and growth as we journey from one end of the continent to the other. We will start our journey on the foggy island of Tox and walk our way to Ak'Anon where our journey will end. We shall teach all we know of the zones that we pass through, show the major "sites to see" along the way and of course give a chance for many people who have not seen all the wonders of Norrath to go and journey in a large, safe group. Bring provisions and your hiking boots for we shall journey together and share and learn in the true Ruis Saille fashion.<br><br>OOC: I am hoping this will be a fun and educational event for everyone. Please, if anyone who wishes to participate would either be prepared in Tox forest or make arrangements with me at Sunray@ruis-saille.com so that I can meet with you and port you in would be most appreciative. We will start our run and anyone who is not KOS with the Erudites will get our first bind and we will go from there. There will be quite a few of us, so running in any outdoor zone should be fine and there will be no problem of getting jumped by something that we cannot handle. We shall bind along the way, just in case there are any accidents.

Here's the latest quotes and excerpts written by Gordon Wrinn and found on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057521.html"><b>Shaman Root Nerfed?</b></a><br>It hasn't been modified, changed, or otherwise nerfed. Bad rolls can happen from time to time. NPCs also have a chance of rolling for better than normal stats (including resists) at character creation. <br><br>Since we get accused of nerfing root every few weeks, I'll promise you that if we do, we'll let you know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057444.html"><b>Yeti's are too easy?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Here's something you don't see very often on this board -- a complaint that something is too easy to kill.]</i></font> <br><br>Hehe, yeah, that is fairly new :)<br><br>You've made some interesting observations. Thanks for the note.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057438.html"><b>More on Backing Up Characters</b></a><br>Well it was supposed to be 90 days, but someone put 6 months in the FAQ, so I guess it's six months now :)  In any case, as I've mentioned before, we really haven't deleted any inactive characters at this point. It's just an option that we have open as a matter of technical prudence. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057446.html"><b>"Will we ever have a totally no drop server?"</b></a><br>In a word, no. We believe that a player-driven economy is of paramount importance in a massively multiplayer game. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057423.html"><b>Will roleplaying get you banned?</b></a><br>Teerog's explanation is about as simple as it can get. Roleplaying crosses the line, so to speak, when the actions of one character start to negatively impact the gameplay experience of the user of another character. <br><br>As an example, refusing to group with dwarves is fine. Following an Erudite around using real-world racial slurs is not. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057417.html"><b>Guildwar/Duel Experience Loss</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just a question. Are there any plans to address this in the near future (DoT deaths, bleeding to death, etc)?]</i></font> <br><br>We have no short term plans to address this issue further at this time. It's caused by the core architecture and how damage from indirect sources is calculated. We've "fixed" the issue on the PvP servers (where most PvP takes place) by eliminating experience loss from all indirect sources, such as from the environment (falling, drowning, etc.) <br><br>On the PvE servers, experience loss is still a possible outcome from a PvP encounter. I should stress however that intentionally causing XP loss during PvP encounters is frowned-upon by the GM staff. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056369.html"><b>High Level Problems</b></a><br>I just wanted to put some things in perspective here: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You are now at a level where you are cut off from an entire section of the game.]</i></font> <br><br>You are cut off from participating directly in combat for 2 NPCs. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: They have now set the precedent that your level can determine what part of the game you can play.]</i></font> <br><br>It was set before, like, for instance, not giving experience when too high in level. Not an exact comparison, but applicable nonetheless. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: They have now decided that they are going to intervene because players are getting cool stuff "too easily".]</i></font> <br><br>Thus preventing people who are taking a challenge from getting that "cool stuff". <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi - tell Verant to listen up and smarten up. You are setting the precedence that you are now able to REMOVE sections of the game from players over a certain level. What, you think the Dragons are REALLY that special? It's a nice f*cking graphic for a different goddamned MOB. Get over yourself.]</i></font> <br><br>Not to mention there are still other dragons in the game. <br><br>Anyway, we may very well reevalutate our decision on the dragon issue. But please, consider our intent. We wanted to preserve an expected "right of passage" for the people who they were intended for by making these changes. There will always be other, in fact far more, dragons that other higher level folk can attack.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056428.html"><b>Vocerate: Water</b></a><br>I'm checking into this. We recently found that a couple of cleric spells weren't available in game, and will be fixing that in the patch tomorrow. It is possible that there might be another spell or two with similar problems.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057085.html"><b>Level 49 Summon for Mages</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: A while back GZ and/or Abashi had mentioned plans of a 44 and 49 summon item spell. We got the 44 summon(Rod of Modulation). I was just wondering what happened to the level 49 summon? Is it still in the works? Has it been tossed aside or what?]</i></font> <br><br>We don't have a 49th level summon planned at this time. We could probably implement one just for the sake of doing so, but it probably wouldn't be anywhere near as useful as the various things that expand the abilies of mages into areas held by other classes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057351.html"><b>Inactive Accounts</b></a><br>Secondly, we keep characters for inactive accounts a minimum of 6 months. To date, we haven't purged any inactive characters from the live servers, but have to keep the option open due to technical concerns. If you resubscribe at least once within the six month period prior to cancelling, you shouldn't have a problem.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057393.html"><b>Emailing Gordon</b></a><br>Heh, I do feel a bit bad about putting that automessage up, but it finally reached a point that *something* became necessary. Yesterday I came into work and found over 150 emails on the PvP issue that I'd posted about 18 hours before. This was in addition to the normal load of email, including the ones asking why I don't respond to email. <br><br>Though I certainly try to read all of my mail, I'd say on average I have time to answer about a dozen outside emails. Though I'd like to get to them all, it's purely a matter of getting the biggest bang for the buck. I can spend 5 minutes answering one email that will go to one person, or spend 5 minutes answering that same issue in public and having it go to thousands. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: He could at least forward the message to customer service]</i></font> <br><br>I frequently get things that are customer service issues and forward them to the appropriate people. I also get a fair number that I forward to the test team or the design team. In general though, people should send their customer service concerns to <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a> and testing issues should go to <a href="mailto:eqtesting@verant.com">eqtesting@verant.com</a>.</UL>

Gordon responded to a funny post making some interesting observations about the game.  Here's the post:<UL>--Why there are no children in Norrath? Where does everyone come from?<br><br><b><i>I guess they magically come into existance in their late teens :) We wouldn't want to put children into the game as then we'd have situations where people attack them. That sort of imagery wouldn't really add to the game.</b></i><br><br>--Where do the vendors get milk? I have yet to see a cow.<br><br><b><i>Bear milk? Er, yeah, that's the ticket. :)</b></i><br><br>--How boring it must be to be a guard. Nothing to do all day but kill snakes, beetles, and the like. <br><br><b><i>What I find amazing is how they keep their combat proficiency up by killing lowly vermin all day.</b></i><br><br>--Why is an Ogre selling items in Freeport? I thought Ogres were KOS in Freeport.<br><br><b><i>Some parts of Freeport are a little more tolerent than others.</b></i><br><br>--Why does it rain so much in the desert? The Oasis of Marr is going to end up being a temparate climate (bring on the swallows!)<br><br><b><i>I spent the last 8 years in Tucson.

Gordon, in response to a post on the Gameplay Board, gave us a status on where they are at with a number of Rogue issues.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057394.html">the thread</a>:<UL>Poison - This needs a major overhaul. Please look into this as soon as possible.<br><br><b><i>Poison is nearly done. We're looking to have around 50 poisons, including DOTs, DDs, Debuffs, and others. </b></i><br><br>Pickable Locks - Add a ton of these, to all kinds of dungeons, so everyone will WANT to group with Rogues on dangerous adventures.<br><br><b><i>We're taking care to add pickable locks to new dungeons that we create. We probably won't, however, add them to existing ones, except perhaps as part of a complete dungeon revamp.</b></i><br><br>Better Weapons - There ARE some good Rogue weapons out there, but most work in the primary hand only. There needs to be more offhanded quality rogue weapons with nice procs.<br><br><b><i>There are plenty of good rogue weapons out there. Like anything else, you can never have too many though :) </b></i><br><br>Feign Death - Why isn't this an ingrained rogue ability? Rogues are the masters of Stealth, Evasion and Trickery. Perhaps a scaled down version of Feign Death could be offered to Rogues.<br><br><b><i>Rogues won't get Feign Death. We elected to give Evade instead. Feigning death does not fit into our idea of what a rogue should be able to do. Monks get it on the basis of real-life where some have shown the ability to slow their heart-rate and respiration to a level near death. Necros/SKs get it due to their "kinship" with death. <br><br>Anyway, as I've said before, rogues are extremely powerful melee characters, and a benefit to any group.</b></i><br><br>Ah yes, the evade skill. It was wonderful when they first put it in. Over time, strangely enough usually after a patch has gone in, it has become less effective. Much less effective. <br><br><b><i>We haven't changed Evade's effectiveness since we put it in. It's just a matter of perception. When someone first gets a new ability, they notice the extreme difference between the way things used to be and the way they are now. As time goes on, the novelty wears off and they perceive that it's less and less of a big deal.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Here's the latest posts from off the Gameplay Board that Verant/Sony's Gordon Wrinn made:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057029.html"><b>Spell Scroll Idea</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you play a druid, you are constantly asked to sow people. If you are an enchanter, legions of players ask to be breezed/claritied. If you play a wizard, armies flock to you for taxi services and binding.]</i></font> <br><br>We don't view these things as bad. Quite to the contrary, players relying on other players is a big part of the game by design. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This causes a lot of wasted time for those that can provide these types of services. For example, if a wizard is asked to teleport, the wizard has to meet the person somewhere, he has to memorize the spell, he has to cast it, he then needs to get back to where he wants to be and finally, at some point, he has to meditate to regain the mana lost by teleporting someone]</i></font> <br><br>Very true, but there must be some cost to the dependence otherwise it is trivial. For instance, if there was an item in game that created unlimited money, the value of money would drop significantly as these items showed up in game. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When it comes to SOW, breeze/clarity, teleport, and binding, I think other solutions should be available.]</i></font> <br><br>Some other solutions for some of these are available in the form of Alchemy. Not for everything of course as we wouldn't want to destroy class interdependance, or turn one class (shamans) into the class that replaces all others. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How about giving casters a new skill called &#8216;spell scroll&#8217; or something to that affect. The &#8216;spell scroll&#8217; skill could then be learned like any other skill. Using the &#8216;spell scroll&#8217; skill, casters could create single-use spell scrolls ]</i></font><br><br>Any further expansions in the area of providing a craftable item that invokes a spell will be made via alchemy. Though I appreciate your opinion, we don't want to see classes excluded from a group on the basis of the people in the group being able to cast a bunch of those spells.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057072.html"><b>Where has Abashi gone?</b></a><br>We had a company thing going on this morning. I didn't get into the office until shorly after 1pm my time, which would be after 4 yours. Then I found over 150 emails, most of which were about the PvP thread posted yesterday. People are quite passionate about the issue :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057093.html"><b>Server Moves for Bertoxxulous & Karana</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: for what it's worth... I have two friends who successfully executed the "/movelog yes" command on Saturday. Even though there has been nothing official put forward, we were speculating that the fact that movelog is working (on Bertoxxulous) that a split is coming soon.]</i></font> <br><br>The /movelog command can always be executed. We just clear the file that is generated at the time that registration for a move is officially opened. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon: Any ETA on the New Server for Karana & Bertox?]</i></font> <br><br>It's in our network room now undergoing setup and configuration. It looks like we'll probably be taking registration either later this week or early next week.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057140.html"><b>Half Elves & Rods</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why cant half elves equip mod rods ? it seems that they should be all all . Half elves are the only race that cannot equip.]</i></font> <br><br>I don't have the stats on the item handy, but if it is available to all classes, there's no reason to exclude half-elves from the list of races. I'll check into this tomorrow and see if we can get it in for the next item update after this Thursday's patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057142.html"><b>Does Abashi defend and protect EQ or listen to the customers? </b></a><br>I don't think that the two concepts are mutually exclusive. We want EQ to remain successful and to do that we need to keep our players happy. Of course keeping players happy isn't as simple as granting "wants". It's not about "defending and protecting" EQ, it's about keeping the game fun and exciting. <br><br>Sometimes that requires doing things that might not seem to make a whole lot of sense until I have a chance to explain it. Even then, I'll surely be unable to explain it, or "convince" everyone that the chosen course is the best course of action. Heck, sometimes the chosen course *isn't* the best course of action. In these cases we've consistantly shown that we listen to the players concerns and act upon them. </UL>

Gordon made a few more posts this evening on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop on all of them:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057053.html"><b>Negative Posts</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Have you ever noticed that almost all the topics in this forum are negative! Nothing seems to be done. Its always complaints, or people saying they're quitting because of poor customer services... What do you think about US? I just dont get it...]</i></font> <br><br>People stop complaining when their issues are addressed. Often this is preceded by a few posts of praise, but those are quickly drowned out by the next group of people with issues that they feel need to be resolved. No one feels any reason to keep responding to praise threads because they feel that nothing good will come of them, afterall, their issue is resolved. <br><br>This is just the way human psychology works. We do address a great number of issues from week to week. It's just hard to get people as worked up about being happy.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056995.html"><b>"What does it mean to play EQ?"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: First, what is VI's "vision" for EQ? Personally, I have no idea what it is. Evidently it is important to VI, so why are they so shy about fully and completely saying what it is? Shouldn't it be in the manual? What about on this site?]</i></font> <br><br>Well other people actually mention the "vision" more often than what we do. It's not exactly something that can easily be quantified and placed on a web-site for open viewing. It's the culmination of everything that we've planned, expected, and learned about EQ throughout development and later into production. It's how we want EQ to be. <br><br>People often say that ClassX should be able to do "X, Y, and Z" (what X, Y, and Z are varies from class to class and person to person). In some cases, these ideas are contrary to what we had planned for the class (e.g. our vision for the class). There's no document that we can open up that tells us what we can or cannot do in all cases. Sure, we have the several hundred page EQ design doc (which will never be public), but it of course doesn't cover anything. <br><br>When an issue comes up that hadn't been previously considered, we (the design team) sit down and decide whether that issue merits some kind of action, based upon whether there is a problem to be solved, whether a solution is viable, and whether that solution fits into what we had in mind for the game. If we can come to some sort of agreement, we modify the "vision" (e.g. In this case, our thoughts and feelings about the way things should be). <br><br>A lot of people who read the board and the news sites on the Net probably can give you a pretty good idea as to what our response will be to any particular issue. Overall, we want to provide people with a challenging and fun game, to the extent that it encourages them to play the game for a long time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Second, what does EQ want to be when it grows up, besides being EQ2? The issue here is it a FPS with some community interaction or is it a CRPG?]</i></font> <br><br>We're obviously going for RPG :) But being an RPG doesn't mean that we can force people to "roleplay", as people have differing ideas as to what "roleplay" is. Furthermore, there are players that no matter what environment they are in, will never "roleplay" as a matter of choice. What we can do is provide everyone with options. Whether or not they pursue those options are up to them. I would love to see a world where everyone acts "in character", I just don't think that there's any way that this could be enforced. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Roleplaying requires a certain amount of interaction beyond "Where do you want to camp? ]</i></font><br><br>I would certainly agree with that. Of course, people have to make the decision engage in things other than camping. If everyone chooses to play the game in the fashion of choosing the quickest path to advancement regardless of the amount of fun that they have *during* that process, then that is their choice to make. You, as a roleplayer, can choose not to camp. You can choose to take actions other than that being taken by the people who are only interested in advancement. Sure, both options are valid gameplay styles, and we support it for that reason, but at some point people have to be responsible for thier own choices. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is no real growth in a character that I can associate with camping on trainer hill in CB waiting for the SBS to drop ]</i></font><br><br>The easy solution here is: Just don't do it. Choose to take actions that support "real growth in a character" in your opinion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Well, you say, what about the powergamers? What about them? The game as it currently is is geared towards them. To them, EQ is an FPS. More involved than most, but still just a hack-n-slash for exp and loot. ]</i></font><br><br>Only if people *choose* to play it that way. Again, it's in your hands. Choose to play it in a different manner. MMORPGs are not single-player games that can provide a single plot with some minor subplots, and expect everyone to follow them. MMORPGs have to provide all possible content up front and allow people make their own decisions in regard to how they are going to choose to play the game. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If they want to develop a true roleplaying community, they desperately need to add some human intervention on the back side. What this means is that GMs and/or guides establish quests and storylines and get people involved in them. ]</i></font><br><br>These can and do occur, quite regularly. Of course, unlike pen and paper games where four or five people are sitting around a table with one guy directing the dynamic content, EQ has 265K+ subscribers in nearly every country in the world. Though we'd like to be able to provide a "DM" to every group of people for the purpose of generating dynamic content directly for them, finances don't allow it, at least not for $10 per month. The Holy Grail for every MMORPG, both present and future, is to give people the feeling of a dedicated DM. Small MUDs can sometimes do it, but no game of this scale really can. This is one of the reasons that player-run events are so popular. The player can create their own dynamic content for themselves and their fellow players. Check out some of the news sites. There are usually a dozen or so player-groups doing this every week. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Next, hybrids. Why is this concept so difficult in EQ? When I first signed up, it never even occurred to me to be anything but a ranger. Ever since I started reading the boards, I have seen very little to show me that this was a smart choice. ]</i></font><br><br>I'd recommend against letting others on the internet decide for you how you feel about things. I read a post from a guy here a couple of weeks ago. He'd played the game for three months, had a wonderful time the entire time he was playing. Someone referred him to the boards, and a couple of weeks later he quit. He got the impression that somehow something must have been wrong with him judging by the amount of negativity on these boards. He was having the time of his life, until he let someone else tell him how he should feel. Decide for yourself. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Nerfing - Why does this even occur? If there is a problem with a certain class/object/spell/race, fix it. Lessening a skill/ability/person because there is a problem does not address the problem.]</i></font> <br><br>Sometimes nerfing is the *result* of fixing the problem. Nerfing is simply making something less powerful or useful than it was in the past. Though painful, it is sometimes necessary. As game designers, though it would be more popular, we cannot allow ourselves to get into a situation where we exclusively *UP* the power of things in the game in order to make up for an imbalance. If one item is too powerful, we often won&#8217;t get into a situation where we have to A) provide weapons of higher power to everyone else in the game B) then up the power of the NPCs in the game to make up for the fact that everyone is now more powerful. Nerfing is sometimes the best choice for the health of the game. At other times, the best choice is enhancement. <br><br>We will do whatever we feel is the best choice for the issue at hand, and it will usually be the choice that affects the least number of people. <br><br>As an example of how perceived &#8220;mudflation&#8221; occurs, take a look at the &#8220;rangers plight&#8221;. Six months ago, everyone (meaning, other melee characters) were all complaining about how powerful the ranger was, and how it was our &#8220;pet class&#8221; since it&#8217;s fairly well known that Brad plays one. Six months later, rangers are now complaining about how bad they are. No negative change has been made to the core ranger class. What happened? Some other classes received enhancements whereas the rangers didn&#8217;t. This &#8220;imbalanced&#8221; the ranger class in the eyes of many who play them. They feel that they&#8217;ve been nerfed even though no negative change has been made to the class. They now want to be enhanced based upon the perception that they are no longer as powerful in relation to other classes as they once were. This is the danger of mudflation. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Customer service - It seems to border somewhere between being a sick joke and an active campaign by VI to tick as many people off as possible. I got stuck in a doorway in Felwithe because of some glitch. I could not do anything. I petitioned and it took almost 1/2 hour before a GM showed up. They did nothing. ]</i></font><br><br>If a GM showed up and &#8220;did nothing&#8221;, there&#8217;s a good chance that it was an apprentice guide, since they do not have the powers that a full Guide or GM does (e.g. the power to unstick you). I do apologize for it taking a half an hour to &#8220;show up&#8221;. Keep in mind that there are a bunch of people on the server, all of them expecting the same level of service as the next guy. Though you&#8217;ve only petitioned two times in your EQ career, there are many that petition hourly for one issue or another. <br><br>We do the best that we can to provide you with the best customer service we can for a $10 per month fee, and we continue to improve the service regularly. Though I wish we could change this, there will always, however, be people who feel that they have received poor service, and will take their issue to the public. Many of these situations arise out of unrealistic expectations about what GMs and Guides can or should do. I think that perhaps one of the more pressing issues to be addressed by customer-service at this time is to help the players understand the situations in which they can expect customer-service help. Hopefully if we can do this, we can cut down the number of requests that we have to deny, giving more time to address the issues that we have some control over. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: is not meant to be flamer, just honest criticism and a search for answers. ]</i></font><br><br>And I do indeed thank you for posting your thoughts. I hope that my responses have been helpful.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057054.html"><b>Unforseen Consequences</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Unforseen consequence of high lvl spell restrictions?

I received the following from Mordeki:<BLOCKQUOTE>torms billowed beneath a malevolent sky. Mordeki's steed could barely<br>be seen within the fold of night, black upon black. His long ebon cloak<br>shielded his obsidian armor, and a cowl tapered his sinisterly chiseled<br>features. He spurred his steed forward as he descended the valley in the<br>Rathe mountains to where he saw the encampment's glowing embers that<br>burned into the midnight sky.<br><br>Sometime later the proud shadow knight of the House of Dra'Vedd stood<br>before the old crone, Madame Eva. "tell me what you see..." he inquired<br>as he sat across the table from the gypsy. Odd trinkets hung throughout<br>the wagon. Skulls, swirling beakers that overflowed with mists, charms,<br>sigils, and other strange things that laid trapped in the confines of<br>jars and other containers.<br><br>Upon a velvet cushion the crytal ball filled with a smokey hue. "I see<br>the son of hate will rise up. He is strong and his hands run red with<br>blood. His one is touched with a particular venom", she spoke with her<br>eyes focused still upon the smokey sphere. She stammered a bit,<br>"Vengefull spirits from the beyond..."<br><br>The cowl concealed the features of the Teir Dal whose hate began to<br>boil, "Bah I do not have time for spirits...tell m of the book...I must<br>have it...". The dark elves lips turned upwards in a snarl beneath the<br>hood of his cloak as his hatred mounted. It was then a cold wind blew<br>through the wagon. An inky cloud of blackness filled the wagon and their<br>was silence.<br><br>Mordeki sat atop a hill overlooking the encampment, a black bound tome<br>folded under one arm covered with the face of what seemed a groaning<br>spirit carved out of its "hide" cover. The flash of crimson orbs and<br>haunting laughter filled the air as the child of Dar'Vedd crossed<br>spurred his steed into the night and vanished into its embrace.<br><br>In the wagon the sage gypsy muttered her last breath of life. "I curse<br>you son of Dra'Vedd...may the eye of Mal'Arigar swollow you whole with<br>the unborn son of the futures wrath...", she gurgled past dying<br>lips...and faded into the void of death.<br><br>Off on the horizon were two brothers, both the heads of armies. One who<br>embraced Hate and the other Valor. Now would be the dark lord to come,<br>and his army would bring damnation in its wake. The cursed son of a<br>misbegotten house...and now the servant of armageddon itself. This was<br>the future...and written upon it were not just the dogs of war, but the<br>demons who preyed upon them.<br><br>Mordeki Dra'Vedd<br>Fist of Hate<br>"may his hate make you strong"</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Here's some late night posts Gordon Wrinn made a few minutes ago on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056230-2.html"><b>Archery</b></a><br>Archery was designed as a secondary form of combat. It was not meant to be more important or useful than melee combat or spell-casting. I understand that there are a lot of people out there that want to see it as a primary form of combat, seeing themselves as "archers", but that is not how we intended archery to be used in Norrath. <br><br>That said, there are some bows in game that do quite a fair amount of damage allowing someone to step back and take a few pot shots from time to time, but it won't replace melee.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056669.html"><b>Quest Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - The balance of the human monk sash/headband quests]</i></font> <br><br>There is no "balance" of sash/headband quests to implement. The ones that people were getting by killing off the guildmaster were artifacts from some old quests. <br><br>As for the other two issues you've brought up, I'll refer them to the test team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056706.html"><b>Dragon Poll Complaint</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I really Don't understand why you designed the poll the way you did... You basically force people to vote, even though they might no have issue with the current topic or understand it.]</i></font> <br><br>That's why a "I don't know/no opinion" option was presented. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Only the people that it effects should be able to vote on it. How is a level 5 newbie supposed to know about a dragon raid? do you think he cares? It is most likely he doesn't and he will just by pass it.]</i></font> <br><br>That level 5 "newbie" might be affected by it someday so has as much of a right to have his opinion heard as the people who are directly and immediately affected.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056671.html"><b>The Hole</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The Hole opens, and the players respond with "yeaah! Another place to kill!". Is it just me, or should the opening of the hole be a big event in the world of norrath?]</i></font> <br><br>It was a "big event" as you suggest. Several things happened all over Norrath across all the servers in the days leading up to the opening of the Hole. I am sorry that you missed them.</UL>
