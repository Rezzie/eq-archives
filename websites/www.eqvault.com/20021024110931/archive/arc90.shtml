<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Interesting event news to report to you tonight.  The following post, the first of a few in <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004737-2.html">this thread</a>, was made by a Verant CS rep on the Gameplay Board:<UL><I>Starting August 27th, the new events launch with the first of the &#8220;Best of the Best&#8221; series, that will pit the greatest of the servers against the greatest of the servers. During this week all servers will run the Warriors Championship. Rules for this event are simple, with no artifacts, no buffs, and no right clicking on any item (but wearing activatable items is acceptable, just not the use of those items). <br><br>These events will not have any entry fee, but players must be of 55th level or greater to enter. The winner of the event will be given a title of &#8220;The Champion&#8221; which is the 51st level title of the class. All of &#8220;The Champions&#8221; will be copied to Test Server, so that on Sunday at Noon (PST) all of the champions will face each other. Those that place (4th, 3rd, and 2nd places) will receive their 59th level title, and the winner of the &#8220;Main Event&#8221; will be dubbed the 60th level title (the Warlord).<br><br>Security for these events will be absolute, with Lake Rathetear shut down on Test Server for the duration of the event. The only characters that will be allowed in the Arena on Test Server will be the Events Staff, the Champions of each server, and possibly some members of the press who are covering the events. All others who come into the arena via gating in or having logged out there will be summoned out of the arena and binded in a far away land by a member of the event staff as soon as the player is discovered. There will be no exceptions to this.<br><br>After the event, all characters copied to test will be deleted, and titles will be given to the characters on their respective &#8220;live&#8221; server&#8217;s characters. This is to insure that the Test Server does not receive added players or items. Security measures will be in place to make sure that no items from the &#8220;live&#8221; servers end up in the hands of the Test Server. I know that there were concerns with this with the original announcement of bringing the champions to the Test Server, but rest assured that actions will be taken against those responsible IF something happens, not the server itself.<br><br>www.everquest.com will also carry all information and standings of the events for this great event.<br><br>At the conclusion of the warrior&#8217;s competition, a random roll will determine the next class that will have the excitement of this style event. The titles awarded again will be 51st level title for the winners of the server competition, the 59th level title for the runners up, and the 60th level title for the grand champion of that specific class Norrath-wide.<br><br>There will be a week of normal events that all levels and classes can enjoy, then the week of the new classes competitions start. This is so that all levels, races, and classes get to have fun with the events. When it comes to the game-wide championships, those will be dedicated only to the 55th level or higher players. One week dedicated to all levels, then a week dedicated to the class specific events that will determine the best of each class in the game.<br><br>More information should be released early next week, including official rules and regulations of the Warriors Event. The Events Staff and myself look forward to bringing you these new events.<br><br>Lady Daegarmo &#8220;The Faithful&#8221;<br>Online Events Coordinator <br>Verant Interactive</I></UL>Here's the second post from Lady Daegarmo:<UL><I>Just to make sure we are all reading off the same scroll here, a few points<br>First, these competitions will be every other week. This leaves a week of competitions that are designed for the other levels on the server.<br><br>Warriors were chosen because it will be the easiest of all the classes (Save maybe Monk) to judge, and I would like to test the Event Staff out on the easiest class to judge first.<br><br>As for fairness, remember there will be no less then 4 judges at this event, 30-some competitors, and myself at the final event on Test Server. If you have ever worked or grouped with high level characters, I assure you that they dont normally miss a detail, and are very verbal if they see something that is incorrect. I am certian that it will be fair.<br><br>As for equipment, the only items under review at this time are those with delays of 10 and 11, but all other items will be allowed. Why take away what players have earned?<br><br>I saw the remark about the PvP server's warriors going to crush the Non-PvP server's warriors. All I can say is that we will see on Sunday the 3rd if Rallos, Tallon, and Vallon end up crushing their foes.<br><br>Finally, as for tactics, when you consider the disciplines available to high level warriors, what a bad "combination" of one to the other could do, and the timing of those abilities, I am sure that this is more then a Flinstones club-match where they take turns bashing each other over the head. =)<br><br>Looking forward to it,<br><br>Dae</i></UL>Here's post #3:<UL><i>Since I announced the large scale events without giving the knowledge of the others involved, it appeared that we were ignoring the other types of events.<br><br>Below is a complete listing of events that are coming up, but there are some non-combat events that are being worked on, but still in the testing phase.<br><br>The event being held on all servers with the warriors is an example of a Tournament Event. We are taking it to the next level with the multi-server compeition.<br><br>Tournament Series Events<br>&#61623; The &#8220;Tournament&#8221; Series Events are designed to be held in addition to the original &#8220;Test&#8221; series events.<br>&#61623; These events are class specific for those not wishing to engage other classes that are of similar kind to their own class, or compete in a smaller sized event (2 hours is target length).<br>&#61623; These events are designed to have a lower entry fee as the target audience is much more specific.<br>&#61623; Anti-Twinking rules are currently under review, and maybe acted upon at anytime by the Event Master of Verant Interactive without warning.<br>&#61623; All of these events are designed as single elimination, standard bracket tournaments.<br>&#61623; All of these events are designed as player vs player events.<br>&#61623; Tournament Series Events are being designed as the standard, and most run event on the servers.<br>&#61623; Tournament Series Events are designed for all levels in mind.<br><br>Test Series Events<br>&#61623; These are the Original Series of events that were designed to put similar classes up against similar classes for a more broad range of player involvement.<br>&#61623; These are designed to be high entry fee (Lx10 plat), long lasting (4 hours or greater in length), and high competition events for those wishing the &#8220;Big&#8221; Event atmosphere.<br>&#61623; All of these events are designed as single elimination, standard bracket tournaments.<br>&#61623; All of these events are designed as player vs player events.<br>&#61623; Test Series Events require and will always require a Game Master to be present and run the event. Test of Tactics requires an Event Master to be present and run the event.<br>&#61623; Test Series Events are designed for high level players.<br><br><br>Challenge Series Events<br>&#61623; These are single player vs. environment (True NPC&#8217;s) events designed to test game knowledge and &#8220;Challenge&#8221; even the greatest of players to their limits.<br>&#61623; These are designed to be very class specific and level specific, with a low entry fee (LxL in Gold) for short timed (2 hours or less) events that many can enjoy.<br>&#61623; These are designed as an achievement level event, meaning that players will have to overcome different levels of creatures and continue to overcome creatures to the point of death or request by the player to cease the Challenge to achieve the final score. The character who defeats the most amount of mobs does the best in these events.<br>&#61623; Challenge series Events are designed for all levels in mind.<br><br>Competition Series Events<br>&#61623; These are single group or multi-grouped events that pit players against predetermined NPCs in a race to defeat these NPCs to achieve a time to be judged not only server wide, but game-wide as well<br>&#61623; Competition Series Events are designed with no entry fee and no prizes, simply for &#8220;Bragging Rights&#8221; to other groups, other guilds, and other servers.<br>&#61623; These Events are designed to be very short in length (60 minutes) at the request of specific guilds to achieve a time to be competitive against other times that have been scored.<br>&#61623; The Competition Series Events are still in final testing, more will be released about these events in the future.<br><br>I hope this clears up a lot of the questions.<br><br>=)<br><br>Dae</i></UL>And uh, thanks Gordon. :)

Here's the latest quotes and excerpts from Gordon Wrinn found on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005049.html"><b>Casual Players</b></a><br>I see your point Twigglin, but what do you propose? It does take time to set up for a group. That time is pretty much the same, regardless of the amount of time that you play in a day. Why is this a penalty? How do you suggest that we "fix" it? We can't *force* people to take you into a group in 10 minutes, nor can we reduce your travel time (other people have that ability). <br><br>Now we are implementing the LFG (Looking for Group) flag. Hopefully this will allow people to determine where a good place to look for a group is, and maybe even arrange the group prior to arriving. This could effectively cut down time 1 & 2, as you know where your going and there's a group there for you. <br><br>I wouldn't say that any of this constitutes a "penalty" for the casual gamer, but perhaps the person who plays 10 hours per day does indeed get an advantage. I doubt, however, that many groups would stay together for 10 hours without undergoing a period of looking for additional members, which affects them as it does the casual gamer. <br><br>In short, I really don't think that what you are citing is a problem that needs to be "fixed".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005071.html"><b>Recent Rubicite Drops</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This could be the revamp. You dont know.]</i></font> <br><br>This is not the revamp. There's some story behind what's happening now, so you might want to look around a bit to see if you can find it. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005072.html"><b>"Desperate Cry For Mages"</b></a><br>I'm not sure where you've been hunting, or if it's been in a few specific areas, but you might consider trying another areas out. There are some spells, for instance, that don't drop in all areas. If you've been hanging out in a few that have higher spell drops for the other classes, perhaps you've missed any areas that might have higher percentages of mage spells. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Now, is this intended, or am I the unluckiest mage in EQ?]</i></font> <br><br>That's a possibility as well :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005073.html"><b>NPCs and "Comparable" Weapons</b></a><br>heatsink, check out the section of the FAQ that deals with why NPCs must be stronger than PCs in most cases. The short of it is: <br><br>1. It's a group game. If the NPC were no stronger than a player of a particular level, it certainly wouldn't be a challenge for two. <br>2. You are smarter than the NPC. The NPC gets some extras for being computer-controlled, and therefore not as intelligent or adaptive than the average human.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005074.html"><b>Wizzies and Group Friendly Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:Would it be asking too much to give Wizards ONE group friendly spell?</font></i><br><br>I'm with Lelenae on this one. Ports are *very* group-friendly spells. Though they do not enhance the offensive power of a group, they can be very handy for getting out of trouble. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:1- Warriors, Monks, Rangers, SKs, Paladins, etc.. are stuck. They have to run forever.</font></i><br><br>That is indeed a danger. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:2- We lost our spot.</font></i><br><br>Don't camp. Don't fight some place where you need a "spot". Go someplace where there is no waiting and you can wade in at your own pace. There's tons of them in game at every level. Just say no to camping.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004934.html"><b>Guild Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Or to pay 10,000pp or more. I was told this by a guild today, that at high levels I can not do parts of the game (for which I paid $50 for) unless I join a guild. I feel it is not fair, I do not have 20 or more friends to get to do plane raids, or other high level things.]</i></font> <br><br>I'd have to go with DarckHellfire's response. The game is indeed a group game, and the size of a group needed to do certain things goes up as you advance. Most people should have formed relationships by reaching those levels that provide the much needed support. Those who don't form those relationships are usually the ones who solo exclusively or have shown themselves to be a burden to groups through reputation. <br><br>You don't *need* to be in a guild, however guilds are a nice way of making it easier for a large and extended group of friends to recognize each other. It's also useful when it comes to getting some pointers on how to do certain things. Some areas of the game have a bit of a learning curve, and it's sometimes nice to cut off the bottom portion of that curve.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005041.html"><b>Rallos Zek Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Is there any plans on changing the looting system?]</i></font> <br><br>No. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Will there ever be a chance to move to another server?]</i></font> <br><br>Maybe. We're still considering the issue. Nothing is likely to be decided within the next month. I'd really like to see a server-specific polling mechanism put in, but it will be at least two weeks before we can do work on that. It would be at least a week after that before something could go live, and a few more to set up and implement any kind of meaningful poll. That's basically the plan at the moment. Of course it's all subject to change. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Do you have any other options you are working with other then the two mentioned above?]</i></font> <br><br>Not really. I think that the thoughts posted here have determined without a doubt that there are many different opinions on how PvP should be handled. I don't think that there is a solution that will please everyone, or even most everyone. We're a bit nervous about making any more major changes to the environment going forward. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My question is WHY HAVE TWO IDENTICAL PVP SERVERS? Would it not make more sense to have:]</i></font> <br><br>Because there are enough people to support it. More people enjoy playing Teams than they do on an open PvP server like Rallos. Items being allowed, it still makes more sense for it to be allowed on Rallons than on the Teams servers due to the level range. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: BTW, any word on returning pumice stones to merchants as self-only??]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, we've ruled it out as an option, and decided that the current stone is appropriate.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004886.html"><b>Scale of Wolf Update</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale will no longer be canceled by being the target of a melee attack.

Sure, there is a lower concentration of them (found, anyway) in Kunark, but I'd hardly say that they have "gotten the shaft" as you put it. There's more than enough items out there for casters. Kunark fauna just happens to be more melee-centric than other places. Perhaps something else might be observed elsewhere. <br>--<br>I should also mention that we're about at the point that we're running out of "useful" things to do with caster items. There's only so many different ways to do +int and +mana before it's all the same stuff, and we all know that only +int and +mana stuff is considered "useful" by the casters at large. <br><br>We can do so much more with melee items.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004876.html"><b>Accusation Response</b></a><br>You might want to read the sentence you found issue with again: <br><br>"The worst ***armed monk*** versus the best ***armed warrior*** still favored the monk by 10%" <br><br>I added emphasis to the appropriate places. The case where the warrior outdamaged the monk was when the monk was ***unarmed*** and the warrior was armed with is best weapon. Every case where the monk used a weapon, he outdamaged the warrior. <br><br>I understand that this confusion was accidental, but in the future I would like to politely request that you be certain before breaking out accusations of lying.

Gordon Wrinn made a few more posts recently on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the skinny:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-2.html"><b>Play Nice</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: BTW, this maybe shoulda been on the rants board, but perhaps GW will come down and answer this mere mortal....why why why do you create rules that are detrimental to the players? Play nice started off as a way to prevent KSing and verbal abuse. Play nice should not be exploited as a means of allowing everyone the same chance at a spot in line for toilet paper...err...getting xp.]</i></font> <br><br>The Play Nice Policies were created because a growing number of customers were being subordinated by other, more powerful, groups of players. These other groups would claim "ownership" of spawns, loot drops, and even entire zones, refusing to allow other people a chance to experience them. On some servers, guilds had certain areas camped 24x7. <br><br>The play nice policies, in regards to spawns and camping, are designed to promote equal access to the areas. If a group can get into a room, they have as much right to be there as anyone else. Are the policies perfect? No, of course what is? No matter what policy we adopt, there will be people who are helped by the policy, and others that are hurt. Sometimes the policy may help them in one instance and hurt in another. <br><br>As I've mentioned in the past, if anyone has any ideas for policies that are easy to understand, are enforcable, do not require a larger CS team than before or after the Play nice policies, and will please everyone, I'd be happy to discuss them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004665.html"><b>Reimbursement For Next Patch Spell Change?</b></a><br>We're fairly open about the fact that things in game are subject to change at any time. This includes the prospect of both positive and negative changes. People making trades in game need to be aware that that there exists a chance that any item is likely to drop in value or usefulness after you buy it. It's sort of like buying stock in a company in that regard. <br><br>The spell was never supposed to be usable by magicians, who ended up able to use it only because the level restriction was transposed by the designer. I really wish we'd caught this sooner.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004601.html"><b>"Witch" Post Removed</b></a><br>Hello all, I just deleted a post suggesting that a new class ("Witch") be created. The thread was deleted because it degenerated into the disparaging of practiced religion (Wicca). <br><br>As a note to the original author of that post, as that certainly wasn't his intention, we wouldn't create a class by that name due to the fact that it does apply to a currently practiced religion.

Besides the fact that there are 300-400 new threads per day, there's another 4000 posts to go with them. This means that chances are your *post* won't be addressed. However, if you stick around long enough, your *issue* probably will. Of course, if your issue has already been addressed, it might be a while before I'll come back to it. There are issues on this board that we could debate full-time for months and never reach any agreeable resolution. I however can't devote all of my time to any one issue. <br><br>You might notice however that I addressed your post on the "Draught" line 20 minutes before you wrote this post. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004818.html"><b>"Ester's affront to all dwarves!"</b></a><br>GASP! :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000745.html"><b>Wizard Draughts </b></a><br>The Draught line was created to give wizards the option of doing less damage at similar mana/damage ratio compared to ice comet, and also to give them similar spells across the three elements that the wizards control. The reasoning behind "less damage" was to reduce the amount that the wizard would aggro the target. Had we wanted to continue along the same lines as ice comet, we could have given similar damage spells with equal damage, mana, and casting time requirements. <br><br>In this case, the additional time required to stack two draughts versus one ice comet is what you "pay" for the reduced amount that you aggro the target. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003933.html"><b>Nerfs 'N Bugs</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Hey Bashi!

Gordon cleared up a few rumors about the eqclient.ini file on the Gameplay Board this afternoon.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004497.html">the thread</a>:<UL>Abashi himself posted instructions on how to edit it the eqclient.ini manually via Notepad when the new colors went into effect with the latest patch. There's something better out there, though.<br>Some nice people have gone out of their way to create a program that makes the .ini file easier to edit. You just click on the different types of text messages to edit their colors in the game, or change the default run/walk mode, HUD view or full screen, even change background colors. (That last one I didn't even know could be done.)<br><br>My question is, does Verant consider this to be a 3rd-party program that can result in banning of players using it? Since all it does is make it easier to make the same changes that Verant has given us instruction on, and does not affect the actual gameplay in any way, I would think there is no problem with it. Just wanna hear it from the horse's mouth, though. :)<br><br><b><I>No, we wouldn't consider use of EQCLIENT.INI editors as cheating. They are just fancy text editors :) I should probably mention that none of them are, however, officially licensed or endorced by Verant/SOE, and that any use of them is at your own risk. Though I'm sure that the vast majority of people would never do this, with the ease of implementing password-stealing code into a 3rd party program, I'd recommend that you be certain of your source. <br><br>-Gordon </b></i></UL>

A <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396.html">new thread</a> was started by Verant's Gordon Wrinn this Sunday centering on the issue of PvP Teams.  Here's the entire post from the Gameplay Board:<UL><I>Hello,<br><br>I posted this in another thread but it seems to warrant its own.<br><br>The biggest difficulty in regards to PvP in EverQuest is that EverQuest is, and will remain, a primarily PvE (Player versus Environment) game. The addition of PvP to the game should not change the basic fundemental mechanics of EverQuest. PvP in EverQuest has to result in "EverQuest with PvP" rather than "PvP EverQuest", if you get my point. <br><br>One of the largest issues on the PvP Teams servers is the subject of cross-teaming. Players of different teams get together for battles. Due to the PvE focus of the game, this has to be allowed for sake of game balance. Though some have suggested that cross-teaming, either in groups or guilds, not be allowed, it's something that will need to remain for the PvE game.<br><br>The problem comes in when cross-teaming is applied to PvP. Cross-teaming creates a situation that is often referred to as the "invulnarable healer" scenario. Basically, one group of PCs (Team A) attack a group of people on Team B, while supported by a healer from Team B. In this fashion, you have a situation where a member of one team is taking an active role in the deaths of members of their own team.<br><br>There is another "invulnarable healer" scenario that is more common and often just as bad as the cross-teaming scenario. This one revolves around a group of players from Team A attacking a group from Team B, while supported by a healer/buffer who is far superior in level to anyone from Team A or Team B. For example, a group of level ~20 trolls go on a killing spree in Greater Faydark, while supported by a level 50 healer/buffer. The problem in this case is that someone out-of-range is directly contributing to the deaths of players below their range.<br><br>On Friday, I spoke with one of the programmers about possible solutions for the PvP Teams servers, assuming that people in general believe these issues to be a problem. Suffice it to say that there is no easy solution. Each one has its disadvantages and "loopholes". For an example of some of the solutions:<br><br>1. Disallow cross-team buffing/healing<br>2. Disallow out-of-level (+/- 8) buffing/healing<br>3. Combination of 1 & 2.<br>4. Redefine "Teams" servers to GvE (good versus evil) servers and implement idea #1 on that basis, rather than on cross-teaming.<br><br>The problem with all of these solutions is that they have an undeniable impact upon the PvE aspect of the game. <br><br>The final and best idea that we were able to come up with allows things to continue as they are now in regards to PvE, and only places restrictions on the basis of PvP. In this idea, any player who has taken damage from another player would not be able to be healed/buffed/receive any beneficial spells from anyone who wasn't on their own team or in the +/- 8 level range for a given amount of time (a few minutes), or until they zoned. <br><br>In the cross-teaming "invulnarable healer" scenario, the person from Team B would be able to support people from Team A for PvE engagements, however once a member of Team A took damage from another team, they would not be able to receive support from anyone on Team B for a few minutes. In a real game scenario, the maurading band of trolls in Greater Faydark couldn't be healed/buffed by a high-elf assuming that they were taking damage in their attacks. <br><br>In the out-of-level scenario, that same band of level ~20 trolls wouldn't be able to receive support from a 50th level cleric. <br><br>There are some disadvantages to this, such as in the following:<br><br>4 Trolls are grouped with a high-elf fighting PvE encoutners in a dungeon. Humans come in and "slap" the trolls every so often thus keeping the high-elf from assisting them. Perhaps this should just be a disadvantage for cross-teaming in general. Perhaps this is just a risk that people take from grouping with the enemy.<br><br>What are your thoughts on these ideas? What other issues do you see causing problems in regard to this idea? Do the benefits (e.g. reaffirming the servers as PvP Teams) outweigh the potential disadvantages? <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Verant's Gordon Wrinn on the Official Boards:<br><ul><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/001657.html"><b>Gordon or Abashi Please Answer This As Best You Can </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I believe EQ players currently have access to 3 Planes. I believe all 3 are malevolent. Are there any plans in the works for a benevolent plane to be made accessable to players. Just seems like an even trade off. Just thinking maybe some of the characters that are paticpating in the slaying of Innoruck and Cazic would probably feel more comfortable encountering their gods adversaries.<br>Also, I was wondering what kind of faction hits do characters get after slaying someone like Innoruck or Cazic? Its gotta be Incredible]</i></font><br><br>Actually the Plane of Sky really isn't malevolent in nature. It's there to test the resolve of Norrath's citizens.<br>In regards to your question however, though I can't really release any information, we're definitely aware of the players' desire to whup up on the minions of some of Norrath's kinder deities.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002666.html"><b>Need definite rule re: Invulnerable Healers on PvP team servers </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am running through a zone when I observe a PvP fight. A dwarven palladin is laying the smack down on a poor dark elf. I check the health on the DE and seeing he is about to die, I heal and SoW him. This allows him to run away. Both combatants were in their low teens, whereas I am level 27. Am I going to be warned?]</i></font><br><br>No.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My guild runs to Nek forest and starts laying waste. We have 6 members, 5 of whom are level 20, and the sixth is a level 40 cleric. The cleric is only there to heal the other 5 and no one in the zone on the opposing team is high enough to attack him. Is my guild in trouble?]</i></font><br><br>No.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: A group of Evils is attacking a group of Elves. Everyone in the fight is of equal level. However, the darks have brought with them a cross-teaming Elf, who heals the Evils, and can't be attacked by the other Elves since he is on the same team as them. Is the cross teaming Elf going to be banned?]</i></font><br><br>No, there are currently no rules againt the "invulnarable healer", whether its due to an "out of range" healer or a "cross-teaming" healer.<br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No one should be invulerable in combat and you shouldn't have to call an enemy to kills guys of your own race. A design flaw to be sure and this should at least be commented on or addressed by Verant. ]</i></font><br><br>Brega, you can say that the system is flawed and should be fixed, but none of the solutions that have been presented have been endorsed by plurality, much less a majority of the players. There are certainly some pretty rash and obscure things that we could do to try and "fix" this to your liking, but what of everyone else? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I've never seen this addressed by Abashi either. Most players just want Racewars to be coded as Racewars. Invulerable healing and buffing to help "Racewar enemy teams" defeat your own team should be coded out as impossible.]</i></font><br><br>Sure, that seems simple, but what is the reasoning behind, for instance, a human paladin and a high-elf paladin to "refuse" (cf. be restricted by code) to heal or buff each other? Why *must* there be animosity between them?<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Make the healer attackable by his own team for say the next 2 minutes everytime he heals (this happens in guild wars, so it should be possible); ]</i></font><br><br>Can't do this with the way that attack rights are handle. In EQ, if I can attack you, you can also attack me. There's no way around that mechanism. The exploit that pops out is that all I'd have to do to be able to go kill my own team would be to cast a beneficial spell on someone of another team. EQ also can't handle a persistant agressor flag. We know who is casting the spell and who the recipient is at the time the spell is cast, but not after. The same is true with melee attacks.<br><br>These are the options available to us:<br><br>1. Do nothing.<br>2. Disallow beneficial spells across teams. (handles cross-teaming problem)<br>3. Disallow beneficial spells out-of-level (handles, for the most part, the out-of-level situation)<br>4. A combination of 2&3.<br><br>The difficulty is that while we want to support PvP and the Teams servers, we cannot in that process harm the PvE aspects of the game. It's still going to be EverQuest, but will be EverQuest with PvP, rather than PvP EverQuest. <br><br>There's another possible solution (if indeed people feel that there is a problem) that one of the programmers and I were just brainstorming about. Please let me know if you feel that there are any unacceptable problems with this....<br><br>How about... If a player takes damage from another PC, they can only receive beneficial spells from someone in their own team for X-minutes or until they zone.<br><br>Let's apply this to the 3 scenarios that the original poster mentions:<br><br>Case #1: Dwarf is attacking DE1. DE2 is over 8 levels above DE1. Since DE2 is out-of-level with DE1, DE1 cannot take his beneficial spells since he's being attacked by the dwarf. DE2's only option would be to attack the dwarf if he was in range, but in this case, he's not. <br><br>Case #2: The level 40 DE cleric would not be able to support he level 20 marauders since he is out of range.<br><br>Case #3: Evils are attacking elves. Assuming that the elves have done damage to the evils, evils could not be healed/buffed by the cross-teaming elf.<br><br>Other scenarios:<br><br>Human is grouped with 3 elves, they can buff each other all day long. However, a troll attacks the human. The human can now only be healed by other people on the human team.<br><br>Human is grouped with 3 elves, and can buff, etc... The troll now attacks one of the elves. That elf cannot receive direct support from the human, but can from the other elves. The human could, of course, attack the troll if he was in range, just couldnt' heal the elf.<br><br>Any problems with this idea that you can think of?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003672.html"><b>Rogue Theft </b></a><br>Though I appreciate your concern nyrulz, it's a little known fact that a rogue cannot pickpocket the last coin of any type off of a creature. This means that if the creature is spawned with 1g3s5c, the most the rogue can pickpocket is 2s4c. He can't get the gold. <br>That said, I wouldn't let a bad experience with one member of a class taint your feeling towards grouping with that class. Rogues, like everyone else, are played by people on the other side of keyboard, who can be either nice or jerks regardless what class they play.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003987.html"><b>Abashi: I lowered my beta neutral and can't raise it </b></a><br>Talk to a GM in game about this. They should be able to reset your betaneutral faction back to default. If anyone is aware of any current ways to lose betaneutral faction in game, please email them to eqtesting@verant.com so we can get them fixed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004038.html"><b>Has anyone noticed verant is trying to stamp out twinking? </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Has anyone noticed verant is trying to stamp out twinking?<br>First you can no longer loot corpses with consent, so now you cant consent your lower level to just loot the body.]</i></font><br><br>The change in /consent was made due to the level of customer service that was required due to corpse scams every day, which kept the GMs tied up for a good portion of their shift harming customer-service overall.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And i just read a thread that ANY item dropped on the floor will be destroyed! ]</i></font><br><br>No, I said that we wouldn't reimburse for any item that was dropped on the ground. That said, yes, some things that are dropped disappear, and some don't. The point to the thread was that you shouldn't drop anything on the ground that you want to keep.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004041.html"><b>Is it possible to make Arena a no exp loss zone? </b></a><br>There's no XP loss for any death encountered while in the PK region of the Arena. Feel free to battle to your hearts content inside there <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004067.html"><b>Abashi: Confirm faction with the new dragons pls </b></a><br>As most of your questions would result in answers that are spoilers, I can really only answer one: The faction status is intentional.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004103.html"><b>60 war vs 60 mnk, monk wins. </b></a><br>One of the weapons combos I tested, with both the monk and the warrior actually was the moss-twig/jade mace combo. That twig has some serious problems.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004157.html"><b>Abashi: UI Idea: Compass/Radar (mildly plagiaristic) </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In essence it is a compass (in that it shows which direction you are facing/heading) that has "blips" on the screen (a la Radar). Yellow "blips" are MOBs, White "blips" are buildings and (I think) other PCs. It has a line-of-sight area (approx 90 deg), and the rest is out of sight (grayed over).]</i></font><br><br>I've seen what you suggest, however it was decided long ago that "radar" of that nature wouldn't be a part of EQ. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:Could something of this nature be implemented into EQ? This would be immensely helpful to players. Being able to see any and all MOBs in your general vicinity would be a great help. I can attest personally to how valuable it could be, as I've been attacked countless times by MOBs I didn't even know were there.]</i></font><br><br>But people have been prospering in game without something artificial like "radar" there. People learn to work together and post lookouts when in dangerous areas, and pay the price when they don't. The chance of something "sneaking up" on you is one of the dangers in the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004216.html"><b>Camping is a by product of lazy design... </b></a><br>The maximum rate at which things can come in game is tied directly to the availability of the rarest component. A quest with 20 steps that each take an hour, while being a 20 hour quest, lets items into the game at a rate of 1 per hour. <br><br>I'm wondering how rare we need to make things to stop camping. The easiest thing to do would be to make everything random. Of course there wouldn't be much point to quests then (e.g. "Kill in lower guk until you get a X and bring it to me).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004221.html"><b>Abashi, a simple YES/NO please </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Will anything ever be done to make the Disarm/Sense Traps skills even the least bit useful?]</i></font><br><br>We have no plans to increase the usefulness of these skills either by increasing the number of traps in the game nor through revamping the skills. The lack of a use for these skills was one of the driving forces behind redefining the rogue as more of an assassin rather than a theif, and as such, rogues have been thoroughly compensated (as much as I hate using that word). We would remove the skills from the list if it were possible, unfortunately some technical issues prevent that. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004229.html"><b>User Interface INTENTIONALLY bugged??!?! (from the QA board) </b></a><br>Well, artifact from some old UI stuff is probably more appropriate than "intentional" in this case. One of the programmers just fixed this by the way, it should be on Test soon.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004253.html"><b>Abashi Read- Game Threatening Bug </b></a><br>There's really not a trick to it, as when restrictions were placed on what you could do during a trade, removing coin was apparently overlooked. I've forwarded this to the programmer responsible for that portion of the UI for correction. <br><br>I should mention that using "timing scams" or any other trade-related scam will result in loss of game access.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004257.html"><b>Gordon..please start on page 10, and read down from now on </b></a><br>I usually do start on page 5 or so and just keep refreshing it as I run out of posts. Periodically though, I jump to the front couple of pages to handle current issues. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004258.html"><b>Restore Ping, Please </b></a><br>Neglecting your skills while you level was supposed to have negative impact when you decided to raise them after maxing out. Ping actually made that no big deal. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004264.html"><b>Quick clarification on Monk vs Warrior tests </b></a><br>Nuttyo, I'm not really sure what you are asking about haste caps. They weren't lowered when Kunark came out, they were raised, and they remained raised. Both PCs had the same buffs, stats, and items (save weapons). Everything that they had was attainable in game. I wanted to do the test max-hasted, to insure that everything is equal. Without including the enchanter buff, it would only have improved the monks advantage, espicially when bare knuck.</ul>

This weekend will have marked the 25th chapter of their tale at Safka's Lore.<br><blockquote>Safka's Lore proudly presents the 25th chapter of our epic tale this<br>weekend! Since we've now completed our quarter century of episodes we've put<br>together a short update of the events that have been chronicled to date,<br>hopefully this, combined with our character bio's on the site will allow the<br>uninitiated to begin to enjoy our tale.<br><br>"Safka Fairheart was born of Noble blood to the clerical school of Felwithe<br>under the guidance of Tunare. A caring and thoughtful child, her world was<br>shattered by the mysterious assassination of her father. No trace was ever<br>found of the killer and Safka was resigned to never finding the culprit. The<br>teachings of Tunare taught her not to yearn revenge, instead dedicating her<br>skills to saving and helping others.<br><br>As she grew, learnt and travelled out beyond the halls of Felwithe Safka<br>made the acquaintance of a group of adventurers lead by the Dwarf Lord<br>Balar, that were championing the cause of Light against an evil threat to<br>Norrath. Few unfortunately took them seriously, as they had little more than<br>rumour and instinct to guide them.<br><br>After a series of mysterious encounters with an evil necromancer called<br>Bugo, Safka became convinced that there was a plot being hatched against the<br>good races of Norrath and called upon the High table of Felwithe, the cities<br>magical council to help investigate the threat.<br><br>Politics though as usual, came between them and any real aid. The great Seer<br>Denaldar, who had been friend and companion of Safka's father agreed to help<br>them, but the backing of the council was denied them by the Veto of the<br>cunning and ambitious Sovariax, a long time adversary of the ancient Seer.<br><br>As events continued to point towards some great evil presence working<br>against them, Katlinel, enchanter and companion of the forces of Light was<br>possessed by an evil charm, and in the resulting confrontation, Safka was<br>forced to take the life of her closest friend. A plot against the followers<br>of Marr in both Qeynos and Freeport has been uncovered but the friends still<br>need evidence to give credence to their claims . . ."<br><br>Intrigue, battle, love and loyalty bind the characters together in a tale of<br>the eternal battle for Norrath, as the Lady Safka is torn between her<br>loyalty to her betrothed, the wood elf Rhyk and the pressures of unveiling<br>the evil presence that plagues them.<br><br>If you have read the lot or are yet to taste our storytelling, pull up a<br>stool and gather round  . . .the tale continues . .<a href="http://www.eqlore.moonfruit.com" target="_new">www.eqlore.moonfruit.com</a></blockquote>Thanks Safka!

Abashi on the Official Boards:<br><ul><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004016.html"><b>Gordon Thank you for doing a test for us. </b></a><br>For the past several weeks, the complaints by monks here on the board (most of the complaints anyway) have been that they no longer outdamage warriors. The tests that I did were only to confirm that that wasn't true. Yes, I conceed that monks cannot takes hits as well as warriors, but that's never been where the disagreement has been. When people said, "Monks no longer outdamage warriors", I had to disagree, which is why I ended up testing it out. However, when people now say, "We can't take hits like a warrior", I agree with that.<br>Dealing out more damage than the warrior doesn't mean that you'll beat the warrior in a duel, nor that the ratio of damage dealing to damage taking capability is constant. The benefit of extra damage has more weight than the disadvantage of being defensively inferior. <br><br>I'm sure that some would say, "If a warrior can solo creature X in two minutes and be almost dead at the end, then a monk should be able to do the same in a minute and end up almost dead". This would be an example of constant ratio between offense and defense and the two classes. This however isn't the case. If the ratio were constant as suggested, there would, again, be no reason to have the warrior, because the monk's other skills would make them preferable in all cases. Not to mention, there's an added benefit any time a creature is killed faster than normal, a benefit that can't be measured directly against the power of the class, but more against its usefulness to the group. Would a group, for instance, like to kill things in 2 minutes and end up OOM and near death at the end? Or would the rather do it in 1 minute and end up the same way? They'd want it done faster in all cases. That's what monks and rogues add as melee classes.<br><br>Concerning everyone saying that the test wasn't "valid", I fully agree with that from a scientific standpoint. Many more combats would have to be carried out than the ones I could do over a couple of hours yesterday. To be honest, its not really my job to test things of this nature, I just do it as needed so I can speak with first-hand experience. Though the specific percentage point differences can't really be considered averages, I do think that the test fairly well answered the question: Do monks outdamage warriors?<br><br>There was one interesting thing in the test that I didn't mention in the post yesterday, concerning the one time that the warrior outdamaged the monk. The warrior was using his best combo out of the 5 weapon combos I tried, the monk his worst (bare knuck). The damage ratios were determined by seeing how long it took for the character to kill the NPC in question. The monk completed the task in under two minutes in every case but one, where it took 2:03. The warrior was over two minutes in every case, with its fastest time at 2:01. The monk's best time, by the way, was 1:30.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003944.html"><b>Would a second arena with pets be possible? </b></a><br>Pets work in the Arena. Initially when the Arena was put together, pathing data wasn't included. That pathing data was put in a few months ago, and since then pets have worked properly.</ul>

This weekend on the Xegony server the First Xegony All-Norrathian Drinking Gathering will be held. It will be on Saturday, the <br>12th of August. <br><blockquote>**************************************************<br>* First Xegony All-Norrathian Drinking Gathering *<br>**************************************************<br><br>Hail citizens of Xegony!<br><br>The time has come to sit back and forget about spawns, loot, experience and <br>money for a while. You are all invited to the first Xegony All-Northian <br>Drinking Gathering.<br><br>*********************<br>* What is the Idea? *<br>*********************<br><br>The idea was conceived by 2 fellow adventurers, Balkin Ironfist and Ellegon <br>Grossfuss. We are both Master Brewers and enjoy having a good time without <br>constant competition. So we wanted to organize a gathering where we can hand <br>out free drinks and have fun with old and new friends.<br><br>*************************************<br>* Where will the Gathering be held? *<br>*************************************<br><br>We decided to take West Freeport, as it is relatively easy to reach with <br>boats and TP's and is a newbie zone, therefore there shouldn't be wandering <br>MoB's killing drunk people. We are aware that certain races or classes are <br>KOS in Freeport, but there is no place where EVERYBODY is safe. Just watch <br>out for the guards if your race/class is disliked! :-)<br><br>******************************<br>* How do I come to Freeport? *<br>******************************<br><br>You can either travel by foot and boat, or you can ask your friendly Druid <br>or Wizard for a Teleport. We are also trying to set up a taxi-service with <br>volunteer Teleporters. More about that in the section "How can I help?"<br><br>*************************<br>* What does it cost me? *<br>*************************<br><br>Besides some time, absolutely nothing. The alcohol will be given away free <br>of charge. You can tip the brewers, breezers, binders or the teleporters if <br>you want, but it's not at all necessary. This will NOT be a gathering for <br>the rich or to make money. It's only purpose is to have fun.<br><br>****************************<br>* When will it take place? *<br>****************************<br><br>The First XANDG will start on Saturday, the 12th of August at 6 pm PST (9pm <br>EST, 2am GMT).<br><br>*******************<br>* How can I help? *<br>*******************<br><br>The easiest way to help is: Spread the word! Tell all your friends, your <br>guild members and the people you meet in the zones. Post it on your guild <br>boards and websites!<br><br>In addition, we still need a lot of help from everyone. We decided to search <br>for some services to offer and therefore look out for:<br><br>- Brewers: Everyone with the brewing skill can attend and distribute his/her <br>drinks to the attending people. We don't care about your skill, as even Bog <br>Juice is alcohol :-) All we ask, is that you accept the fact that we're not <br>SELLING beverages. Again, this should be a free event, just for the fun of <br>it.<br><br>- Foragers/Gatherers: A lot of the higher skill level drinks need <br>ingredients that can't be bought. Good examples are Vegetables (very much <br>needed), Fruits, Berries, Froglok Meat, Snake Scales or Royal Jelly. So <br>everyone who can forage or collect these ingredients is welcomed to donate <br>or sell them to us. Yes, we will buy them. The simple reason is, that when <br>we make high end brews (like Hulgarsh, Ginesh, or Bleeding Brains), we will <br>most likely gain skill levels (we are both around 140 brewing, but not <br>maxed). Since we don't want to take advantage of your generosity, we are <br>willing to pay 1 or 2 plat per stack of Vegetables and also some pay for the <br>other ingredients. Of course we will gladly accept donations :-)<br><br>- Taxis: We want to offer a taxi-service between the various parts of <br>Norrath to Freeport (respectively Commons) and maybe back. Therefore we <br>would need some volunteer Druids and Wizards playing Taxi. We would allow <br>the teleporting personnel to collect tips if offered, but the TP itself <br>should be free of charge.<br><br>- Breezer/Clarity: The taxis will need a lot of mana and would very much <br>like a breeze or even a clarity cast on them. If you would be able to help <br>them a bit, please do so.<br><br>- Binders: Some of those who attend might like a bind in Freeport. We want <br>to offer this to the ones asking for it. If you can cast Bind and will do it <br>FREE of charge, why not join in the fun?<br><br>If you would like to help us in any way, please contact Balkin and Ellegon <br>at xandg@hotmail.com!<br><br>********************************<br>* What will I get for helping? *<br>********************************<br><br>No money, and no exp. If a player tips you, then so be it. But we ask anyone <br>participating, to offer his services for free. I'm sure you see the good <br>will behind this event and the possibility to make some new friends.<br><br>****************************************<br>* You still have additional Questions? *<br>****************************************<br><br>No problem. Contact us at xandg@hotmail.com!</blockquote>Thanks guys!
