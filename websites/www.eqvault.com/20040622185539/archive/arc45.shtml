Our esteemed Mr. Shadoe has been busy as of late.  Aside from his normal duties as a columnist and author in the EQ community, he's also traveled a good chunk of the country recently.  His latest <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid986865696,81679,">report centers around the Fan Faire event</a> held in San Diego over the weekend.  It is most definitely a read not to miss as this clip will show you:<UL>So, after 750 miles and $1000 later we discovered what was once kosher had suddenly turned into the proverbial Sausage McMuffin with Egg in the face of the Torah. This, friends, is what two years of volunteered time and service amounts to in the guide program. When someone's word is checked, double-checked, relied upon and it still falls through in the end, something is definitely not right. <br><br>Doubly so when you consider the fact that Verant's own Mrs. Butler didn't even have the guts to fight her own battles. Instead of coming out and denying us access face-to-face, she opted to enlist our gracious host, a GM, and an elder guide to do her dirty work as she hid herself behind closed doors. Mrs. Butler effectively quailed away from facing down a 5'6" housewife in the same way a tobacco company quails away from cogent empirical evidence. Such cowardice speaks volumes to this member of the press, and it paints a vivid picture of the way things can often be in the guide program under her majestic rule. But to be fair, what does one expect coming from an employee who just happened to be dating (and later married) a prominent Verant staff member at the time she was hired to fill the position? </UL>As always, a new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=10642205&start=10642205">feedback/response thread</a> has been activated on our General Board.

Hitting the Developer's Corner after a big weekend, here's all of what Alan had to say today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000081.html"><b>The Cat Who Walked Through Walls</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Forgive the Heinlein quote, I couldn't resist :)<br><br>I am a new player, so this question may be long since answered but I could not find it anywhere so thought I would ask it anyhow. Creatures can see and walk through walls. This appears to be common knowledge, something I found out the hard way. <grin> <br><br>I was prepared to simply shrug and live with it until a madman came in out of the desert and killed me through a wall while I was shopping. Is there a plan in place to change/repair this 'feature'? <br><br>Again apologies if this is a repetition. Oh, and thanks for creating a new addiction for me! :)<br><br>Alerius the (all singing all dancing) Bard ]</i></font><br><br>Quoting Heinlein titles is fine with me. A good bard needs to be aware of the great bards, after all. <br><br>Yes, that question has been asked several times. But I'm more than willing to answer it again. <br><br>Creatures walk through certain walls on purpose. The huts and inns you see out in the plains of Norrath, such as those out in the Commons near Freeport, don't prevent the passage of NPCs because if they did they would be easily abused. For example, Hill Giants would not be able to attack a player character through the roof of the inn, but you might be able to stab at his feet. And creatures used to get stuck against the geometry of those buildings all the time. So, while we certainly understand that it seems strange to have a bear wander through the walls of a hut, it's something that needed to be done.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000080.html"><b>New PvP Server</b></a><br>Jera300 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'ver heard references that the next server to be released will be a PvP server. I am very excited about this, would it be possible that this will be a new server, instead of a split server? It would be nice to start out with everyone on the same footing (ie:less twinking). Any information on this would be helpful. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I don't have much to tell you all yet. We did announce at the Fan Faire that the next server we bring up will be a PvP server, and that that server will have some new rules. I'll announce more when we've firmed up the details.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000079.html"><b>Support For Windows ME</b></a><br>Bullshmidt wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor- <br><br>I was wondering if Verant ws planning on suporting Windows ME for Everquest. I was wondering this because many of the large computer manufactures (Dell, HP, Gateway and Compaq for example) are begining to ship their high end home computers with Windows ME pre-installed. <br><br>Thanks. <br><br>Sperhawk Rocsword<br>40 Enchanter, Rabid Reich<br>The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br>While we don't 'officially' support ME, EverQuest runs on it just fine. Let me, once again, just quote Kendrick, who seems to be the featured Dev guy of the week. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Everquest works fine with Windows ME. Most of the (very few!) compatibility issues were from the days when ME required you to install DirectX 7.0 as part of the OS, and EQ was still using DX5. <br><br>Since we did the switch to DX7 prior to Velious, it's something of a non-issue. <br><br>There may be some older graphics cards that don't have DX7/8 drivers, but those folks can't play EQ now, no matter what OS they're using. ]</i></font><br><br>So if you are running ME and are seeing issues, make sure that you've checked the other potential problems (usually sound or video drivers) before thinking it's the operating system. It might be something you can fix more easily than changing OS's&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000019.html"><b>Roleplaying or Just Playing?</b></a><br>StormFront wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I happened to be looking through various posts and discovered the Role-Playing or Just Playing comments. I thought I would just give my thoughts. <br><br>First I have a High Elf Paladin, and have wondered about the way others would precieve my character when he comes across gruff with the evil races. Not wanting to party with them and such so I created a Dark Elf ShadowKnight just to see what the attitude of the land was towards those characters. To my surprise most people seemed to enjoy playing the DE and even though they were despied it never seemed to affect them. On a couple of occassions I have witnessed true DE tactics at work. Once I saw a DE ShadowKnight ask to join a group which sent these RPs in total hysteria, just to have the DE walk off gleeful he had stirred them up. Take it for what it's worth. <br><br>I also have a Wood Elf Druid, I understand the statement that we are to be the protectors of nature. However there is a fine line and others have asked how a Druid could attack a wildlife entity. My answer has been that of what most Native American believe which is how I feel the Druids must have been like(Though I admit I could be totally wrong). Druids wish to protect there environment but understand that they must live upon it and have no problem with the hunting of an animal as long as the entire animal is used and not wasted on momentary gain or sport. The senseless killing of many animals would get to them, but using them for food or clothing is acceptable as long as done with respect to them and not meaning a massacare of everything. I work with tailoring but kill only to equipment myself and for food when I am low and a town or merchant is not available.<br> <br>However I can see instances where role-playing becomes difficult especially when stakes are high. When your after that important item or you have lost your corpse and can not locate it and it has the offering you have to make to your god for a specific quest (just an example). Would you be willing to bend your character to accomplish these? In real life you sometimes have to swallow hard and deal with a situation. Perhaps allowing a character to be designed with regards to who they can group with and who they can not, dependent on their deity. If you were to lock out charcters from grouping solely because of race or class then you lose a bit of the reality. Maybe instead they suffer a faction hit and will need a way to correct for it, just a thought. A kind of atonement for their transgression. Having a instance where a character can deviate from normal can add something to the fabric that we call Norrath, making the area even more unknown. I have enjoyed RPing sometimes it is just interesting to determine why someone might act the way they do and come up with the reason even if they are wrong or not. I myself would like the ability to select the races or classes that I might fear or shun, granted there should be automatics, since I could have a quirky personality and noone is quite sure why. <br><br>Sorry to be so long but that is my thoughts about it, I think it would be fun to play on an RP server! ]</i></font><br><br>I think it's great that you've taken the extra step to play on both sides of the fence. A lot of people will play a single class or race for a long time and perhaps fail to understand some of the issues involved in playing one of the classes that they don't normally get along with. I'm not talking about 'my class is better than your class' stuff, but about how the communities work. For example, I've gotten the impression over the last two years that folks playing Dwarves tend to be more likely to roleplay than others. I don't know why, or if it's even true, but I've played at least a little as every race in the game, and I think it's true. Or I've noticed that it is a lot easier to be in-character when playing a good cleric than an evil cleric. As a 'good' cleric, it's easy enough to heal people when they ask. But for an 'evil' cleric this just might not be in-character (though it can be). <br><br>It is always easiest to abandon roleplaying when it comes to the 'high stakes' stuff. The temptation is great. And most of the time it's in-character to do such things as dealing with a necro to help get your corpse, even if your character might normally never do such a thing. High stakes for the player is usually high stakes for the character as well (your character doesn't want to lose his stuff either). But there are cases where you should sacrifice what you want for what your character wants. When the two desires are not the same, roleplaying means putting the character's desires first. <br><br>And I do agree that it seems that the best way to 'enforce' any sort of roleplaying (though I don't really like the idea of 'forced' roleplaying) would be along the lines of deity restrictions. How easy that would be to do in EverQuest I don't know&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I specialize in Halflings, and role-play everyone to the tee. It is my favorite part of EQ. I am the leader of a Small Races Only Guild and we exclusively roleplay, especially the worshipers of Bristlebane. <br><br>I think the idea of a Roleplaying Only server is great...only, could it be a new server where everyone has to start over at level one, no switch-over characters and high level twinks from other servers. That way everyone can start at the same level, and grow as a server together. Just a thought. <br><br>This board format is great!! <br><br>Apathos<br>From a lot of Servers and a lot of Personas, all Halflings ]</i></font><br><br>I know of a few Trolls that specialize in Halflings too&#8230; <br><br>IF there were to ever be such a thing as a server with rules built with roleplaying in mind, then it's my opinion that it would have to be a non-split server. You're right, a server like that would need to grow up under the new rules. <br><br>Dulc wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Up until March, my husband and I had played on only non-pvp servers. We love to roleplay, but eventually gave it up for the most part, because too many players reacted in a negative way. We had a paladin and cleric couple, for which the paladin was my Champion. He played it very chivalrous and honorable, no thees or thous, but maybe the use of "m'lady, m'lord, sir, mistress" etc. made people feel uncomfortable. We had reactions ranging from disgust to apologetic. There were a few that jumped right in and roleplayed with us, but for the most part it was a struggle. <br><br>Anyway, a friend offered to help us discover Tallon Zek through a roleplay story and we accepted. What a difference! Suddenly we were fearing for our lives, not just from npc's but from characters for which we had no idea what they might do. We are playing "shorties" and the added threat of the "dark alliance" has just enhanced the roleplay. This make me think that a roleplay server should be pvp, but with a safety net around the cities. On non-pvp servers, people can say whatever they wish with no reprecussions for the most part. But if a "light" race challenges a "dark" race in pvp, you may have the whole zone on your back. So yes, I personally am enjoying roleplaying a dislike of the evil races on Tallon Zek. But I wouldn't do it on a non-pvp server. Hope that makes sense. :)]</i></font><br><br>Well, it can be argued that the use of thee and thou wouldn't be appropriate for roleplaying in Norrath, as none of the cultures really use it, as far as I know. I've seen the same thing, though. People getting uncomfortable with use of more, um, flowery language. But then, I get uncomfortable around the use of words like 'plz' and 'r'. :)<br><br>Fear is a useful roleplaying tool. I don't think that it can be the basis of roleplaying in EverQuest on its own, though. I understand your point, though. The idea that you can attack another character based on whatever rules are set up tends to improve the interaction between those characters. On a standard server a High Elf is limited in the ways that he can express his dislike for Dark Elves in exactly the same way that he can't express his dislike of a rude Wood Elf. On Tallon Zek the High Elf has the ability to be more aggressive to a Dark Elf than to a rude Wood Elf, and that tends to make the willingness to be aggressive towards Dark Elves higher. <br><br>Kingfish01 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: No, no, no. You are absolutely wrong, and that's what frustrates me about EQ. <br><br>Your idea that "pacifists make poor adventurers" is patently false, but indicates why EQ is a challenge for roleplayers. <br><br>Now, I've enjoyed reading these comments and your responses abou this, but I must take issue with you. <br><br>Because of its design, EQ has no room for explorers, historians, cartographers, merchants, sages, hermits and evangelists (is not faith an important issue for EQ characters?). Why can't these characters exist? Because EQ only tolerates combat oriented roleplay. <br><br>Why can't players be multi classed, changing careers later in life? Why can't they experience conversion and change faith? I enjoy EQ, but your gameworld exists in a narrow box. <br><br>Adventure involves more than killing things, but EQ is almost exclusively about killing things. EQ is fundamentally a "kill something so you can kill something bigger" game. It's quests almost always involve the death of an NPC. But it doesn't have to be this way!!! <br><br>EQ SHOULD have ways for player to gain experience in other ways. The easiest would be to award experience for successful skill development. It should be possible for a player to be a 30th level blacksmith, tailor, or whatever, and still not be able to fight their way out of a paper bag. In theory, this is possible, but is unreasonable. Tradeskills depend on high level spells and materials, making it necessary for Master craftsmen to be also master casters for the most part. <br><br>Personally I think it is a programming cop-out to make almost all experience gain related to killing things. A little creative thinking could expand the roleplaying aspects of the game immensely, without sacrificing anything that currently exists. <br><br>Sorry for the rant, but it frustrates me that EQ could be so much better, but I don't see that happening. ]</i></font><br><br>Pacifists DO make poor adventurers. There's nothing false about that statement. <br><br>What I think you disagree with is that adventuring is a poor focus for roleplaying. I disagree. <br><br>While the focus of EverQuest is adventuring (much like most pen and paper games), it certainly doesn't exclude the roles that you've mentioned. Explorers certainly have a place in Norrath. Explorers in a dangerous world are basically adventurers anyway. Historians, cartographers, merchants, sages&#8230; all of these are not roles on their own. If you are playing a cartographer that likes to sit around the house and read maps, or a historian that likes to read history but doesn't like to talk to others about it, then you don't really need a multiplayer game. Hermit is so much not a roleplaying idea (sure, the GM could use it, but as a player character a hermit would never, ever, be in a game&#8230; Evangelists would be something that would be hard to do in EverQuest. <br><br>Yes, you can play a cartographer in EverQuest, and play one well. But I won't argue that such a character is somewhat limited by the mechanics and content of the game. Most certainly you can't make and sell (or give away) maps in game. That is partially a design limitation, but primarily a technological one. EverQuest does not have any sort of automated map making system by design. But then if it did, who would need a cartographer. As for drawing your own maps in game, that is more of a technology issue than a design one (or, if you want, it was a design decision not to develop the technology to allow such a thing). <br><br>But none of the careers you mentioned are directly prohibited by the game itself. In most cases where they are limited the limitation comes from technology or time restrictions, not a desire to hinder roleplaying. The best example would be your evangelist. Despite the fact that you can't actually change the little word(s) on the character description that the player sees, you most certainly could 'convert' people. You could convince them to work for the betterment of your chosen deity. You could convince them to do things that would bring their faction in line with the factions best suited to your deity. You could convert someone to your religion if the player of that character was convinced that his character would be converted. <br><br>No, the game doesn't really support such activity with gameplay features. We can't support all such features. I wish it were technologically and monetarily feasible. <br><br>Oh, and it is possible to be a 30th level tailor and still not be able to fight your way out of a paper bag. It would be really hard, but it could be done. <br><br>There's no cop-out here. To program a game (and get it done before the programmers die of old age) a feature set must be chosen. Some things won't make it, everything can't make it. <br><br>We just work day to day to get closer to the perfect game. <br><br>Sorry, that was a bit long-winded. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Part of the problem with roleplaying is the designers don't always consider those that want to roleplay when they do the quest. <br><br>Example: Iksar monks have to worship Cazic Thule, yet to do their Epic Quest, they have to gain the respect of the human monk guilds, one of which is dedicated to Quellious. An iksar "properly" roleplayed shouldn't have to do human quest. <br><br>Azzad ]</i></font><br><br>Well you can look at this two ways. First, if your Iksar wants to trick the stupid Humans into liking him so that he can gain something he wants, there's no need to sacrifice any roleplaying. <br><br>But if your Iksar is not the type of lizard that would do such a thing (an honorable lizard-monk), then don't do it. I see people using the word 'forced' to get an item all the time. Your Iksar does not 'have' to do a human quest. That's one of those things that I talked about before. It's one of those decisions where you either choose to roleplay and not get something that the player wants so that the character can remain true. If your Iksar doesn't want to do the quest because it's not in his character, having him do it is a concession to the player. <br><br>I know that the argument here is that the Iksar should be able to get the item by some other route. That an Iksar monk should be equally able to get that item if his player is roleplaying or if he's not. I don't agree. I, personally, like the idea that some paladins (as this is the most common example) will be able to roleplay in a world where they get to make a hard decision. Fair isn't a part of roleplaying. So while it might be fair to argue that from a game design standpoint such a quest is unfair, it's wrong to do so from a roleplaying standpoint. <br><br>Anyway, keep in mind that a lot of my reply in this post is my personal opinion. <br><br>As a representative of the company, I will send your concern about the quest to the team. I know a guy that's interested in looking into that sort of thing. :)</UL>

A <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid986865403,64421,">follow-up to <i>Where Silence Reigns</I></a>, one of Shadoe's latest editorials, has been published this evening.  The message board thread spawned by the editorial contained some very intense discussions.  Here's a clip of what Shadoe thought:<UL>Needless to say, I was a fish swimming upstream with this one. The EQ Vault poll showed the public was against my standpoint by a margin of 17% at the time I wrote it. Knowing this, I was prepared for one heated debate to ensue on the discussion thread, and I wasn't disappointed. Posters waxed rhapsotic about my siding with Verant, asking if I was on their payroll, accusing me of deliberately skewing my viewpoint -- all of which were highly amusing to see unfold. It's interesting to see the extents people resort to when they're out of new ideas, even to the point of saying that "blaming the [players/customers/escaped mental patients] is the most absurd thing I've heard you utter." An easy thing to say, and it's flawlessly in line with my expectations. <br><br>You see, I recognized the poll results for what they were: a golden opportunity to express my opinion on the matter while at the same time allowing the readers to exemplify my point in the discussion thread. So please indulge me, if you will, and take a good, hard look at the conversation that took place there. Read both sides of the argument. Feel the controversy. Taste the controversy. BE the controversy! </UL>I also wanted to quickly plug in <a href="http://express.stratics.com/credits/shadoe.htm">Shadoe's section at the Otherworld Express</a> where he is currently working on an EverQuest novel called <i>The Pact of Zeranon</I>.<br><br>Check it out!

Dynamite Shortfuze sent in this announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail good wizards of Norrath!<br><br>I come before you today with news of Fennin Ro's first ever Wizard<br>Faire! In months past, I have hosted a Rune Trade on Fennin Ro, and the<br>time has come to expand upon this, with a huge faire... for wizards!<br><br>I'm hoping that this can be held on the 28th of April. I know, it's very<br>early to discuss this, and I don't even know myself if I will be<br>available, but I've been getting pressure to start announcing it<br>(especially from Omnip, who is possibly the Faire's biggest supporter).<br>Let me explain how it works...<br><br>Before, at the rune faires, wizards of all levels would come together.<br>We would discuss life and have fun (the Ol'Tujim's Fierce Brew helped<br>with that I'm sure), but most prominently, we would trade runes. If you<br>needed a rune, you would ask if anyone had it, and you would likely<br>receive it. Conversely, if you had a rune someone else needed, you would<br>offer it to them. Higher level wizards were on hand to assist lower<br>levels in the research of their spells, and fun was had by all.<br><br>No changes are being made to that. We're just expanding on it. This<br>month, we will have contests, games, duels, the rune trade, and above<br>all, fun!<br><br>I would like to offer prizes of cash and items for this event, but as<br>this is an independant project and not one of any guild with a large<br>support base, my income restricts this from being much good. I can offer<br>prizes just fine, they just won't be good in many respects. So much so<br>that prizes would probably have just as much impact if they weren't<br>present. However, if you have any donations of items or cash that you<br>would like to put forward to this, please contact me in-game and let me<br>know. I won't ask that you give it to me until the event (since I can't<br>guaruntee my presence just yet), but I would like to know that these<br>things are available so I can plan ahead with them in mind. If you can't<br>get to me in-game, please contact me at<br><br><a href="mailto:fenninrunes@hotmail.com">fenninrunes@hotmail.com</a><br><br>Also, I am just one wizard, and in past trades, I have had JUST enough<br>alcohol to please the masses. So if you'd like to bring some of your own<br>brew for all to sample, please, I wholeheartedly encourage it!<br><br>We have a few games in mind, and Omnip has some that she won't tell me<br>about (she says it's a surprise and she'll post it on the boards<br>herself), but we can only get better with help. So, if you've got an<br>idea for a game, again, contact me with the procedure and rules at<br><br><a href="mailto:fenninrunes@hotmail.com">fenninrunes@hotmail.com</a><br><br>I'm really looking forward to this month, I expect it's going to be the<br>best we've had yet!

However I feel that there is a severe lack in EQ's interest in the early to mid level player. Everytime I turn around I see a listing somewhere for some new fantastic item, or a new neat spell, or a new interesting quest and they all seem to be designed around the 40th, 50th, or higher levels. I fully understand the developer's trying to keep the game interesting for the veteran players, but I must admit I feel left out. I see little or no development of new quests, spells, or magical items designed around the 10th to 25th level characters. Where are the new items, quests, and spells to make it interesting for our levels. If I see one more item showing up on the third party web sites that require killing some 50th level mob, or require that you enter the most diabolical dungeon, or traveling across 3 continents and camping for 40 hours I'm just gonna scream. I think it's time for the developer's to put stuff out there that us poor souls who have only been here a few months can look forward to. Something I can achieve with others my level. Not something I have to hope that some 54th level character is willing to sell for a mere 3000pp, which of course I have in my back pocket at any given time. Unless I'm not understanding the intent of the developers, I feel a little slighted. Sorry about the rambling. What do you think? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, our most recent addition was designed specifically for the level of character that you are talking about. The Warrens is exactly as you describe, a whole zone for lower level characters. Whatever impression you are taking away from reading web sites is going to be based on what the owners of that site find interesting. For the most part there will always be more 'hype' about the high level game and items and all that. That's what seems to interest people. Those that have characters that are of the level that they can think about getting that stuff are interested in hearing about it. But so are those that are looking ahead to what they might be doing later in the game. <br><br>That doesn't mean that we are not adding content for the early parts of the game, as you can see with The Warrens.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000065.html"><b>Crafted Armor & Magic Damage</b></a><br>WindigoA wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have a question about crafted armor being classified as "magic" and what that really means in terms of fighting a monster that can only be damaged by magic weapons. <br><br>I was fighting willowisps a couple months ago to get some extra cash and another light stone. I had noticed that throughout my fighting career that the boots I wore determined if I could hit ghouls, wisps, etc with kicks. Regular bronze boots yielded the INVULNERABLE message, while my crafted boots, because they were magic, yielding connecting hits that caused damage. On the flip side later I wanted to work with my hand to hand skill since I am supposed to be a fighting machine as a warrior. I had on crafted gloves that were classified as magic, yet everything such as ghouls and wisps that I tried to fight gave me the INVULNERABLE message when I tried to punch. If kick is a secondary skill but allows us to cause dmg to mobs if magic boots are worn, why is a primary fighting skill like hand to hand not able to share the same effect? I haven't tried this in a couple of months because I haven't seen anything in the patch message to tell me that this issue has been addressed! <br><br>When I petitioned asking if my equipment was bugged, I was told that they had no idea why a magic stat item that caused damage normally would not cause damage to items that can only be hurt by magic items. It was suggested to me that the programmers didn't want to infringe upon my monk friends by allowing warriors and others with hand to hand skill to hurt mobs that required magic weapon damage. I don't think this is a viable answer however since I've never been able to do more than 15 or 20 regular hit damage with my hands. <br><br>Thanks! ]</i></font><br><br>You're correct. Initially, fists were never hurting creatures that required magic weapons to damage. Special coding was added to allow Monks to cause damage to such creatures with magical gloves. It was not given to other classes because it is a special code for Monks. <br><br>Obviously the same thing could have been done with kicking as well, only allowing Monks to kick for damage with magic boots against resistant creatures. But Warriors use kick quite a bit, and so it was decided to let them kick for damage under those circumstances. Or it could have gone the other way. It could have been, as you suggested, that everyone with magic gloves could punch resistant creatures. <br><br>Either of those choices would have been more consistent, I suppose. But it's just a perk for Monks, really. It can easily be explained in game by the fact that Monks are skilled in the use of all their limbs as weapons and that's how they can use magical armor as a weapon. The Warrior only knows how to do so through practice with kicking and that he hasn't the skill with his fists to do so (and you'll find that it's probably true that few Warriors have much skill with Hand to Hand)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000070.html"><b>Darkforge Armor</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As of the patch,Darkforge armor looks exactly as it did before.

From AllaKhazam:<BLOCKQUOTE>Announcing a new addition to AllaKhazam's Magical<br>Realm.  Now you can use the equipment database, with<br>its over 5,500 Everquest items, and list the items you<br>have for sale for each of your characters (for<br>platinum pieces of course).  This is a great way to<br>sell off items without going through the hassle of<br>/auctioning, and a great way for craftsmen to<br>advertise their wares to the rest of their server.  It<br>is also an easy way to find that item you have always<br>wanted but didn't want to spend the time waiting<br>around hoping it would get auctioned.  All of the<br>items for sale can be searched either by server or<br>right from the item description page.  No auctions and<br>no hassles.

Like how about some information on Past Heroes of Norrath. Or how Mistmoore relates into the Kunark/Faydwer relationship. Why does Mistmoore like it when you hunt in Howling Stones for example. Or The storyline of Dar brood of dragons... Or some information on the exile of Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen from the Claws of Veeshan. I mean when I say put these books of lore in hard to find places.. I mean anywhere from a vendor in Yelinak's Lair for Information on Dragons, to a new spawn in Crushbone that drops a book telling the history of the Crushbone Orcs. Also how did Frogloks become some of the richest creatures in Norrath? I think if the storyline was developed a bit more people whould find it easier to get into that roleplaying mood. <br><br>Laurana Highwind<br>58 Knight of Tunare<br>Crusaders of Plilo<br>Zeb Server ]</i></font><br><br>I completely agree. I would love to see more things like this in game. The idea that someone could find an old musty tome and discover that it's Mayong Mistmoore's diary, kept up until the day he, um, died is pretty interesting. I'll most certainly plant the seed and see if it grows. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000068.html"><b>New Servers</b></a><br>I'm not trying to single you out by responding to you this way.

And prodding me with sharp objects, while fun, won't divulge any secret information about new servers. <br><br>When we've got one in the planning, we'll certainly let you know.

Yes, it could be clearer (we've had several e-mails like yours).

Check out the latest updates to the Developer's Corner made by Alan today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Agnostic Iksar</b></a><br>Iksar can only worship Chazic Thule. He was their creator, and they know it (unlike some of those that claim they were created by that Brell fellow). The society of the Iksar is very rigid, even in it's current form. Failure to be anything but a devout follower of Chazic is met with death. Those that have any tendency to disbelieve never live long enough to become player characters&#8230; <br><br>I'll query the EverQuest historian tomorrow and see if I can get a little more about their history for your. The more history, the better.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000049.html"><b>Corpse Tracking and Multiple Corpses</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: A friend of mine died in Emerald Jungle and asked if I could help with CR. He had no idea where his corpses were (yea there was 2 of them), so he called me in. I used track corpse (nice work on this spell by the way.. it is great now) and found one of his corpses. He then consented me and I was told I did not have permission to move the corpse. <br><br>Now I understand that when there is multiple corpses in the zone a choice of which one gets selected. But why does it have to be different for track and consent. If it is the most recient then make it the most recient for all or if you want to go with the oldest in the zone fine. But one way or other be consistant with the corpse it chooses. ]</i></font><br><br>The corpse tracking spell and song look for the closest corpse with the right name. But you can only consent the newest corpse. I can see how this might be a problem. You could bring the person with you and have them loot or drag the corpses as you find them. <br><br>I can see the possible value of having the spells look for the newest corpse first. I'll pass the idea on to the team.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>Server Populations and Economies</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: a few questions... <br><br>(sorry for bad english :)) <br><br>I would like to know about a few issues... <br><br>1)<br>I'm not sure if this is for the Developer's Corner, well... . Could you please tell us what the average number of players is you think to be OK for a server. I am from Europe and at the moment, on weekends, there are sometimes about 1500 players on my server (Morell-Thule). There were 170 people online in Faydark the other day. The point is that i am concerned this amount is quite high for the servers, and I got a feeling there are some bad effects developing from this crowding (don't want to see the servers at peak-time though, more than 2000 people, geez). Besides intensive camping with long waiting lists there are especially quite rude manners in the newbie zone of Kelethin regarding kill stealing. <br><br>2)<br>It seems to me that there is a constant inflation of equipment (and money too?) in the game. Example: weapons and armor from Crushbone can be found at NPC-vendors in Kelethin. Equipment from monster-killing drops in price generally. Could it be this is due to the fact that there is no effective item sink balancing the amount of things? Is this intended to be as it is? Or am I even wrong? <br><br>3)<br>What is your idea of the development of the server population? As far as I can see the level of the average character will constantly grow. Doesn't that lead to a population profile with lots of highest level characters and unused newbie zones? Is it intended to be as that or is there a mechanism limiting the amount of people reaching a certain level (except their playing time)? ]</i></font><br><br>I'll just answer your questions by the number. <br><br>1) Actually, 1,500 is a pretty low number of people on a server. I can't imagine that this was a peak time number. If a server were to have only 1,500 players on at peak times, then during off times it might be nearly impossible to find a group. Though crowding certainly wouldn't be an issue, when the server population gets too low there is a legitimate concern about under population. Though with only 1,500 players on finding more than 10% of them in one zone would be shocking. That's got to be a pretty rare occurrence (not the number of people in Greater Faydark, that's number doesn't surprise me if a server has 2,500 people on line at the time). <br><br>With the addition of Velious (and in relation to your third question), I think 2,500 players on a server at peak times isn't too unreasonable. <br><br>2) I'm not an expert on MUD or MMORG economies, but I'll tell you what I see. Yes, there will be a decrease in the value of items over time in EverQuest. Items don't generally leave the economy. This was a known side effect of the decision to not have items decay or get damaged. For the most part, people don't really enjoy doing maintenance on items. It can become a tedious part of gameplay. And for item decay to really have an effect on the economy, to have it effectively keep prices for items stable, it has to eat up a lot of items. This upsets people and makes gameplay less fun. So given the choice to either have items decay (by whatever method) to 'help' the economy or having them remain as relatively permanent things, the designers of EverQuest decided that relative permanency was the better choice. <br><br>So the relative value of older items, ones that have had more time to become more common, will decrease as time passes. Debates have raged over whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, and they will continue to rage. Personally, I think it's a good thing, as an acceptable alternative to the other options. <br><br>3) Yes, there is a growing population at the higher levels on mature servers. Similar to the point about item decay, the only way to prevent this 'problem' would be to have levels 'decay' by some means. That's also not really going to be popular with players&#8230; <br><br>We've added content for the growing population at those levels. And that helps a lot. <br><br>But if you start a new character on even the oldest of servers, you will notice that the newbie zones are not empty. The influx of new players has been steady. Players that have played for a while will start new characters. People will try playing on a different server to see what the atmosphere is like there. The newbie zones aren't empty at all.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000053.html"><b>Stun 'N Spin</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have noticed a strange behavior that occurs when you happen to be turning in either direction when you get stunned by a mob. Rather than stun you, leaving you unable to move, you instead get 'stuck' turning and end up spinning around until the stun wears off. In most cases you will end up facing away from the mob, which can be fatal in the wrong situation. <br><br>This is by no means a priority, but it can be annoying when you are adjusting your view and happen to get stunned into a spin, and then have to spin back around before you can hit them again. <br><br>-Tairnyn ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I rather like it. To me it's like reeling from a blow to the head. The fact that you have to regain your composure and turn to face your opponent again seems like a good thing to me.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000056.html"><b>Trading in Velious Helmets</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I play a cleric who regularly fights in the plane of growth. As such, I have a cleric helm (with no graphic) from there. As this is similar to the quested armors, will I be able to get a graphic for this helm as well? <br><br>From my understanding, you have to "turn in" your helm to get a new one -- so maybe you guys overlooked this one, maybe not. <br><br>Seranthic T'sarith<br>53 Vicar (Coven Nex)<br>Druzzil RO ]</i></font><br><br>The smiths are only going to be accepting the quested helmets for trade in. We probably will not be adding a similar trade in for 'dropped' helms. It's a benefit for doing the quests right now. <br><br>Keep in mind that the smiths will not be giving your old helm back if you don't like the new one. So be sure that you want to make the exchange.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000055.html"><b>Submit Comment Changes</b></a><br>We've added a small feature to the boards that will help us a lot on this end. When you reply to a specific thread, the topic of that thread will appear in the Subject line automatically. So if you want to reply on a certain thread, use the 'Submit Comment' button from within that thread (and please leave the subject as it appears). But if you want to send in a comment that is not necessarily a response to a specific thread, please add a subject that gives a clear indication of the comment included.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000054.html"><b>/Assist</b></a><br>bago-ED wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The assisted person does not need to have auto-attack on for /assist to work. <br><br>Does this mean that if I am main assist and I am targeting a mob, anyone who assists me automatically attacks that mob? If so this will be a big problem. There are many times that I have a mob targeted but I do not want to attack it (i.e. taunting messed mobs, waiting for chanter to mes one before attacking other, checking what mobs are there and their health before choosing, etc.). I don't think assist should work until the person who is being assisted actually attacks. There will be big problems otherwise. ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, this is how it works by default. If you /assist someone, their target becomes your target and you begin to auto-attack. <br><br>If you don't want to have auto-attack start when you use /assist, you can turn that off in your eqclient.ini file. Just open the file with a text editor and change this line: <br><br>AttackOnAssist=TRUE <br><br>To read: <br><br>AttackOnAssist=FALSE <br><br>Do this and /assist will not turn on auto-attack.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000058.html"><b>Ideal Message Length</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: In looking though the various posts which you have responded to I have noticed that most of them are rather short. Is there an optimal message length which we should try to limit ourselves to when posting here? <br><br>D-Phoenix ]</i></font><br><br>Not at all. I have a certain love for typing long messages myself. A long message will be read just like the short ones. But most people send short messages, so most of my replies are to short messages. <br><br>I'll admit that I do certainly prefer messages that get right to the point and don't get too sidetracked. It's also a little bit easier to respond to individual subject types, rather than a list of comments. If one thing on the list is waiting for some research or something, the whole response might be delayed a bit. So it is sometimes better to send us a few separate comments on specific topics than to send a long list. <br><br>But we look at everything sent in. And passing information to the team is a priority. So format and length are far less important than what you actually have to say. <br><br>So far the response has been great. Thanks for sending in your comments.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000061.html"><b>The Plane of Hate</b></a><br>Gattwin wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: There seems to be a lot of complaints about the new Hate and I'm wondering if you are still working on this zone in order to fix these.

The patrolling NPCs have the lowest chance of loot, and some loot you can only get from the statics. <br><br>There is a core issue with this zone that creates the pathing problems and the ability to get whacked from above or below, as well as mystery healing. <br><br>The zone is one of our earlier creations, and the software used to create it was the same we used on all outdoor zones. The problem with that is, NPC collision detection through walls/floors is non-existent. <br><br>The 'new' area has been there since the zone first came up, but wasn't used due to the problems listed above. <br><br>With a few new tools to work with, we felt we could make the neglected real estate usable. <br><br>While I'm not totally satisfied with the pathing/vis issues, I am satisfied that the area is playable, though it requires a bit different play style than most Planar raids.

The zone is a lot more interesting than it was before, and a lot better in terms of gameplay. It's not perfect, that's for sure. Completely rebuilding the zone would help, but not enough to warrant the effort. Rebuilding the zone would take the same amount of time that it would take to build new content, and new content would be a better use of that time since the old one is certainly playable and fun.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000064.html"><b>In-Game Help System</b></a><br>Yossi wrote: <br><br>Greetings, <br><br>With all the new cool commands you've been adding lately, I got kinda lost :)<br>the /help command ingame only let me see what commands are available (and there are alot of them), but I can't get help on a specific command, neither look for a command I forgot, but I know what it's meant to do.<br>I think that adding a little description to each command, so that typing /help <command> will display this description, and maybe typing /help <phrase> will search the descriptions for the phrase and display the matching commands (maybe it should be /helpsearch though...).<br>For example, if I don't remember how to handle server-side filtering, I could just type:<br>/help filtering<br>And get a response like:<br>Commands that match the phrase 'filtering':<br>/serverfilter<br>/... <br><br>Much more useful than the current help system, don't you think ? ;-) <br><br>Actually, if you type /serverfilter with no parameters, it will give you the parameters and a little message about what it does. /wincolor will also give you the parameters and some information about how it works.

A new message is up on the Patch Server:<UL>April 4th, 11:30 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** EverQuest Classic Edition ** <br><br>There is a new package for EverQuest.  It's a small box with a small price.  Here's a bit from the press release for details:<br><br>---<br><br>SAN DIEGO, CA - April 3, 2001 - Sony Online Entertainment announced today that its classic edition of EverQuest(tm) is now available for the SRP of $9.99, a price point that will attract new users to a continuously growing community. EverQuest, the most successful massively multiplayer online role-playing game ever, will be available in both a jewel case and mini box versions at retail stores nationwide. "Newbies" will enjoy all the amazing aspects of the original EverQuest from creating their own specialized characters to embarking on perilous and excitement filled journeys across three continents.<br><br>---<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br>April 4th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** New and Changed Features **<br><br>- Guild Message of the Day.  Guild Officers and Leaders will be able to type /guildmotd <text> to set up a Guild Message of the Day (GMotD).  From then on any time a member of that guild logs in they will see the message with the name of the message sender added at the front, so you will know who sent the message.  Any guild member will also be able to read the GMotD by typing just /guildmotd and the message will be displayed again.  The GMotD will be erased if the server comes down, however.  You will have to reset the GMotD when the server comes back up.<br><br>- /assist changed and improved.  It should be much more reliable now.  It also will target whatever the assisted person has targeted.  The assisted person does not need to have auto-attack on for /assist to work.<br><br>- Fixed a problem with /corpse that kept it from working on corpses that were too far above or below you.<br><br><br>** Skill Change **<br><br>- Foraging changed so that if you are getting the hungry and thirsty messages, your next successful forage will always be drink or food.  We have also decreased the chance of foraging fishing grubs a bit and increased the chance that you will forage water.<br><br><br>** Spell Changes **<br><br>- Acumen now overwrites See Invisible.<br><br>- Translocate now has the proper spell gem.<br><br><br>** Bug Fix **<br><br>- Fixed many crash problems for Windows 2000 users.  This fix will most likely also aid some folks that are not using Windows 2000 that are having problems.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- Velious racial plate helm quests have been added that will allow you to 'trade in' your existing helms for ones with textures.  We have decided to allow the players (or their characters) to chose whether they wish to have the new helmet textures or to continue to use helmets that show no graphics.<br><br>- Five and ten charge versions of Potions of the Bone Field have been added.<br><br>- Kilva's Skin of Flame potion has been changed.  It no longer has the same effect as the Kilva's Blistering Flesh potion.<br><br>- Removed the tinting from Dark Forge and Resonant armors.  Tinting was never really intended to be on those pieces and, frankly, they look better without it.<br><br><br>** Miscellaneous Items **<br><br>- Reduced the 'bottleneck' for getting Howling Stone keys by increasing the availability of one of the quest items.<br><br>- Erudite guards will now be much less friendly to Kobolds.<br><br>- Vendors are once again selling the Coldain Tanner's Kit.<br><br><br>** 'Combine' container changes **<br><br>We've made a change to 'combine' containers.  In order to prevent people from accidentally destroying items, all containers with a 'combine' button will not combine any items that do not form a complete recipe.  This will be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath.  But this removes the only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks.  Their reduced weight and often greater carrying capacity made them more desirable as bags, with the compensating risk that you might just lose something if you made a mistake.<br><br>We will be increasing the weight of portable 'combine' containers somewhat.  Where some of these containers weighed under 1 pound, they will now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit.<br><br>Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks.  In case you didn't know, most tailor made packs have a built in weight reduction of 5%.  We are raising that to 10%.  We will also be displaying the weight reduction of all containers with the information shown on a right click.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

As we can tell from the following load of new postings on the Developers Corner, Alan had a busy day:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000037.html"><b>Transparant Windows</a></b><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Nastar_Shadowsoul wrote: <br><br>Subject: transparant/solid windows in full screen. <br><br>I would like to see the ability to make each window its own color or transparent or not. Right now they all change at the same time it seems. (correct me if there is a way to do it already). I would like to make the chat window solid for easier reading and all others with no color or at least transparent. Would this be possible? ]</i></font> <br><br>This is already possible using the improved interface that comes with Velious. Using the /wincolor function, you can change the background color for and transparency for each window. Just use /wincolor <window name> 100 100 100 3 (or whatever numbers you like depending on your preferences). Replace <window name> with the name of the window that you want to change. The options are Chat, Spell, Player, Party, Target, Buff, Data, Main, Inv, Track or Hotbox. So, as you can see, there is a lot of customization available.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000036.html"><b>Playing on Test and Downloading Patches</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Jimm_The_Magician wrote: <br><br>One problem I have is that when I go between the Test server and the server I usually play on, I have to download files that I've downloaded before. It is very irritating when I go to the Test server for a little while I have to download files, when I go back to my normal server I have to download files. How about setting up the program for the Test server so that it stores the "altered" files in it's own directory or renames the "altered" files so that I don't have to keep downloading them? ]</i></font><br><br>Well, if those files are different on both servers, then you will have to download them each time you switch servers. <br><br>PLEASE READ: <br><br>But, if you find that you are patching every time you start to play on the same server (either Test or the Live servers), then you probably have a virus. The virus has infected your EverQuest executable, and the patcher is seeing that your file does not match expected parameters, and is giving you a new one. <i>If you are patching every time you log into a the same type of server, then you need to get a good virus scanner and run it on your system. </i><br><br>For the most part, the files you are downloading from Test or Live after switching between the two are small. I do it, and I rarely see much delay (and I have the worlds worst connection at home). But if it really bothers you, and you have a lot of extra space on your hard drive, you can do what I've done in the past. Copy your EverQuest directory to a new directory. Have your shortcut for Test EverQuest run out of one directory, and play on the Live servers out of another. <br><br>I used to run out of two directories. But when I bought my new computer I forgot to set it up like that, and I've never really been bothered by the patches. If you are, then at least that's one solution.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000035.html"><b>Second Movelog For E'ci and The Rathe</b></a><br>Since there is still plenty of room on the new server, we will be opening a second move log for people to move from The Rathe and E'ci to Zebuxoruk. This will give those who missed the move another chance to get to the new server. We'll open the log at noon on Friday and close it at noon on Monday, so you will have the weekend to execute the /movelog command.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000039.html"><b>32 Bit Rendering Option</b></a><br>It seemed like a good idea to give this subject its own thread.

I can not see any of the buttons or the framing of that page. <br><br>With a little bit of luck and play, I was able to click the non-visible enter world button. Once into the world, I was able to see all the 3d models and every, but none of the 2d stuff. I saw the chat / hotbox / spellbox / target / buff boxes, but none of the information contained within (ie - text, buttons, buff icons, spell gems, etc...) only the box overlays. <br><br>Every other game I have runs fine in 32 bit mode on my G400Max, why does EQ not? If I change it to 24 in the eqclient.ini I have no problems at all.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, when you change it to 24, EverQuest ignores it and sets it to 16 bit. So that explains why that works. :)<br><br>The 32 bit rendering is an additional feature that we knew wouldn't work with all cards. But is certainly seemed like a nice feature to add for those with cards that could take advantage of it. <br><br>The Matrox card uses a slightly different memory arrangement than the cards we tested this with. We'll look into the Matrox, but we can't promise anything.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000041.html"><b>Guild Message of the Day Info</b></a><br>Yes, you got it. With the patch tomorrow we'll be adding a /guildmotd feature. Here's how it will work. <br><br>Guild Officers and Leaders will be able to type /guildmotd <text> to set up a Guild Message of the Day (GMotD). From then on any time a member of that guild logs in they will see the message with the name of the message sender added at the front, so you will know who sent the message. Any guild member will also be able to read the GMotD by typing just /guildmotd and the message will be displayed again. <br><br>The GMotD will be erased if the server comes down, however. You will have to reset the GMotD when the server comes back up.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000038.html"><b>A Change To Trade Containers</b></a><br>I'm sure we've all done it once or twice (or more). You start looking through your bags to see where that item that you've been carrying around for a month is hiding so that you can finally sell it. But instead of closing your tailoring kit, you combine it. Suddenly you've lost some stuff that you really wanted to keep. <br><br>Well, since EverQuest opened we've been warning you that this was one of the risks that you took when using lightweight trade containers for their carrying capacity rather than just using them for making things. <br><br>We've decided to make a rather dramatic change for the better when it comes to trade containers. <br><br>With this upcoming patch, trade containers will no longer combine items that are not a valid and complete recipe. <br><br>This means that if you accidentally hit combine, the container will not destroy your items. This also means that if you make an error and put the wrong item in the container while trying to cook something up, it won't destroy those items either. This will be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath. <br><br>But this removes the only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks. Their reduced weight and often larger carrying capacity made them more desirable as bags, with the risk that you might just lose something if you made a mistake. <br><br>So, with the logical change in the way combinable containers work (I mean, really, how often does a sewing kit eat a halberd?), we are also going to make them less desirable for just carrying stuff around in. We will be increasing their weight rather significantly. Where many of these containers weighed under 1 pound, they will now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit. <br><br>Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks. In case you didn't know (and I sure didn't), most tailor made packs have a built in weight reduction of 5%. We are raising that to 10%. We will also be displaying the weight reduction of all containers with the information shown on a right click. It seems that so few people knew about the weight reduction of tailor made items, even at Verant, that it seems that this bit of information should be shown to the players.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000042.html"><b>Planet of Sky Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Good afternoon, <br><br>I have seen the items in Plane of Sky get upgraded since the last patch (IE...if you turn in quest items they yeild upgraded and renamed quest rewards)....is there any chance of getting these upgraded items for those of us that have already attained the items? We worked just as hard as anyone currently has to for the items and deserve the same rewards. Any comment is appreciated...thank you. <br><br>Fitz AwlScyzes<br>60th Rogue of the Zebuxorcantspellname Server<br>Knights of Eternal Good ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I guess the first thing I need to say about this is that we made changes to items in the Plane of Sky several months ago, not with the last patch. I'm a bit concerned that people are only noticing the changes now. Hopefully the improved items will draw more people to the plane. <br><br>There is always an interesting dilemma when it comes to items like this. <br><br>It seems that most players want us to retroactively change items that we improve (or replace as a drop or quest reward) and to leave existing items as they are when they are made less powerful. Unfortunately a blanket rule for such changes wouldn't work out very well. Most of these item changes (at least the ones that make a stir in the community) are special cases, and we treat them as such. <br><br>Think of it this way. <br><br>Most people knew what they would be getting for the quest when they started working to complete it. When those people chose to do the quests (or fight the NPC) to gain a certain item, they knew what they would get. And they chose to do it anyway. <br><br>Keep in mind that quests can change at any time, either in difficulty or in reward. Just because something in the world of Norrath was one way today, that does not mean that it will remain that way tomorrow. <br><br>I have to admit to being confused about what this has to do with Haflingz though&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000044.html"><b>Velious Dragon Ring Teeth</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Is it true that you don't need to keep all the individual dragon ring teeth that you collect in velious? I.e. If you've got the one for Wakening Land you can destroy the one for Greater Divide as the WL one will work for both teleports? And if so, what exactly is the order that they're superceded in. (I think I know, but I want to make sure before I destroy anything) <br><br>Thanks. <br><br>Gavving Treewalker<br>Vallon Zek]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, the keys are&#8230; backward compatible. You don't need to keep the old ones. <br><br>If you want, you could try this for yourself by just leaving all but the last one in your bank and see what happens. I encourage you to try these things out in game, experiment.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000043.html"><b>Self Loot Messages Request</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I would like to put in a request to have the loot message that is sent to groupmates also be sent to the looter as well. I think this should apply while grouped or while solo, and perhaps should be switchable so that players who do not want to see their own loot messages can filter it out. <br><br>I can think of two situations where this would be extremely useful. <br><br>1. When fighting low to mid level armed mobs, the weapons that are dropped range from rusty to bronze to fine steel or velium. Rusty weapons just aren't worth the inventory space they take up in this situation when you might fill up on them and be unable to loot the FS later. With a self loot message, you could pick up the weapon, read what type of weapon it is and immediately decide whether to destroy it or put it in your inventory. There would be no delay in inspecting the item with a right click and hold, then a second click to pick up the item. <br><br>2. I have logging on all the time. It sure would be nice to be able to review my logs after a play session and have notes of what items dropped from what creatures. Months later, if I need to replace a particular item, I could use my logs to find out where it came from. Note: this would be even better if the loot message said what creature the loot came from, but that would not be required. <br><br>This kind of expands into another area I would like to see. I would like to have the ability to enter some notes into my logs. The /note command is OK, but there is no cross-reference between the note file and the log, so I can't do things like associate a note with a /loc unless I retype the coordinates. If I could get a note into the log, I could record a location with /loc and then make a note about an NPC at that location. Later I could search through my logs for the note and it would be right next to the /loc. <br><br>--- Geffin Dagrifter [The Keepers]<br>Wealth Redistribution Engineer<br>Level 50, E'ci ]</i></font><br><br>This isn't a bad idea at all. If the rest of your group gets a message that you've looted something, you might as well know it too. The basic assumption must have been that you would have already looked at the item when looting but, as you point out, that isn't always the case. <br><br>Perhaps having the /note command insert the time it was created would help out. That way you could at least compare times. I don't know. But I'll pass your ideas to the team.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000045.html"><b>Boards For Muses</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: With the elimination of the server boards, will there be a place for players to post their writings? For me, at least, reading a person's account of an amazing incounter or hearing about a funny incident was more useful and entertaining than the "go-here-kill-this-get-item" topics, or worse yet, the immature mudslinging that left you with a reason not to come back. It's easy to see why a change was made...but I so miss catching the rare gem of a story that made coming in here worthwhile. I, personally, would find a "Minstrel's Musings" board very nice...a lighthearted place to post(and comment on)EQ inspired stories, poetry and the like. All submitted for approval if need be. I realize it may be low-priority for you, but you've said that you're here for the players. So maybe you'll think about bringing back the fun of the Forum for those of us that play for the joy of playing. <br><br>Thank you for your time, <br><br>Larilei, Devoted Bard of Erollisi Marr<br>10th Harmony, Vazaelle]</i></font> <br><br>Harpy's Head Tavern is the place for in-character conversations and light-hearted fun. As long as it is kept civil and in-character, you should find the message boards there very much to your liking. They will be returning some time soon. Mennix will be shampooing his foot hair for the reopening, so it should be very interesting. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000047.html"><b>Voices</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I don`t know if it can be done, but if it were possibly and easy to make, can Verant add voices to some NPCs? I`m not talking to do a whole load of voices for every single quest they make or anything like that, but simple lines like "Hail!" or a couple of certain quests, let`s say, "Arh! Dark Forge...." and then just add the rest of the sentence this NPC has to say on the chat window. Anyway, just an idea that could be nifty.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, if you get up close to a beggar, you'll discover that some NPCs do have voices. <br><br>But the beggar's voice isn't exactly the same thing as your talking about. His speech is, basically, the same thing as a puma's roar. It's a sound effect, he's not responding to you by speaking. That's certainly a great idea, but right now we're limited by the technology. I'll look into this a bit, since you've got me interested, but I don't think we can have sound effects (that's really what an NPC voice would be) triggered by text events. I'll send this as a suggestion to the team and see if they can come up with a clever way to do it. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000046.html"><b>Firiona Vie's Background</b></a><br>link04 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: few questions <br><br>1.Why is firiona Vie the EQ "covergirl" if shes the daughter of a god when there are many other gods to the equal of tunare (mother of firiona vie if your not sure)im guessing that kunark wasnt nin planning 2 years ago when eq was developed and put out so how is she so important as to stand out,even when the kunark epic is over. <br><br>2.I'm sure warriors through Norrath will agree with my plee for information when i ask Why does some crafted armor add to intelligence and wisdom etc.? <br><br>just wondering about a few of those post back if ya want :)  please i need to know some of these things ]</i></font><br><br>Interesting that you should bring up Firiona. I just finished reading a story about our famous High Elf that suggests you might not be correct about her history&#8230; <br><br>Someone had to be the coverperson for EverQuest. Personally, I would have chosen Al'Kabor. He's far more intellectual, and High Elves are snooty, after all. As game players, readers, movie watchers&#8230; as an audience in general, it helps us to be more involved in a story if we can focus on and identify with the certain characters. Firiona and her group of adventuring friends serve that purpose for Norrath. <br><br>While it is true that the specific tale that was used for the discovery of Kunark in game was not written two years ago, Kunark was certainly part of the original concept for EverQuest. A lot of the game world was drawn from an existing game world created by some of the folks that started this whole thing (I think a lot of it was conceived by Bill Trost). The individual tales that have been written and used for certain characters might be new, but the world itself was part of the original plans and had its own rich history long before I ever heard of it. I think that's part of the charm of the game. <br><br>As for Crafted Armor&#8230; Magic items need variety in the game. I suppose we could make it so that all magical armor that a warrior can wear only boosts the attributes that help fighting. But there is nothing inherently wrong with having other attribute bonuses on them. It might please an Ogre warrior to be able to feel smarter than the average Ogre. It might make an Erudite magician happy to be a little stronger than his fellows in case he needs to show off his muscles to the ladies. <br><br>Not every piece of equipment will be created using a 'min/max' formula for class power.</UL>

From PlanetEverQuest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Shamen</a>.  What do you know about them?  You've grouped with them sure, maybe you even are one.  These mysterious healers of the wilderness call upon the strange and wondrous forces of nature to heal and deal death with abandon.  They mix many useful and often  deadly potions with mystic powers granted by their gods and the  ancient spirits of the world.  You see them all the time .. but how much do you really know about the witch doctors of Norrath?<br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the ancient tribesmen of the realms.  Casting SOW isn't all that shamen can do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Shamen of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

Any word? <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Vanayr ]</i></font><br><br>We had another meeting last Friday on possible changes to the way PvP works in EverQuest. We want to make sure we're headed in the right direction before we announce anything. I wouldn't expect an announcement about changes to PvP until well after the Fan Faire this week. Since a lot of the folks that make changes and decisions about changes also go to Fan Faire, this will be a busy week for us, and making final decisions about this won't happen this week.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000034.html"><b>/Corpse Bug</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Z-Axys /corpse changed? <br><br>Before a recent patch, you used to be able to /corpse bodies up through the trap to where you zone in to Howling Stones.

There seems to be a problem with /corpse and its ability to pull a corpse up (or down) the z-axis. We should have it fixed in the patch this week. <br><br>Thanks for pointing this out.
