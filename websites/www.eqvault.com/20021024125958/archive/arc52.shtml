Attending in record numbers, EverQuest players met <br>their fellow Norrathians and shared stories with the creators of the most popular <br>online role playing game on the Internet. <br><br>Over 1,200 fans attended the EverQuest Fan Faire, hosted by Sony Online Entertainment <br>at the BWI Marriott in Baltimore; some Europeans had even crossed the Atlantic <br>just to attend the event. EverQuest, a massive multiplayer online role-playing <br>game that currently boasts over 330,000 active subscribers, brings tens of thousands <br>of people together for online quests each day.<br><br>"We couldn't be happier with how things went here this weekend," said Cindy Archuleta, <br>Community Relations Event Manager for Sony Online Entertainment.  "This gives <br>our development team and opportunity to keep in touch with the people who are <br>responsible for EQ's success and it gives players the opportunity to meet face <br>to face with some of their online friends for the first time."<br><br>At the event, fans tested their knowledge of EverQuest facts in the Trivia Quest, <br>interacted with the creators of EverQuest in discussion panels featuring members <br>of the development team, and submitted original art inspired by the game in the <br>Art Show.  Other events included a Real Life Quest, in which players had a chance <br>to role-play and solve puzzles for special prizes. Another very popular attraction <br>was EverQuest Jeopardy! which was set up for the event through www.station.com<br><br>Special in-game rewards were given to the winners - the Staff of Gathering and <br>the Sword of Gathering.  Specially created for the event, these items can be <br>used by the winners' characters in EverQuest online.<br><br>In addition, Sony Online Entertainment announced the next EverQuest Fan Faire <br>will be held in San Diego, California this April.</UL>Here are the list of available photographs from this event:<UL><LI><a href="/eqshots/prizestaff.jpg">Prizestaff with Caption</a><li><a href="/eqshots/prizesword.jpg">Prizesword with Caption</a><li><a href="/eqshots/firionaandfan.jpg">Firiona and Fan</a><li><a href="/eqshots/attendees.jpg">Attendees</a><LI><a href="/eqshots/knightarmor.jpg">Knight Armor</a><lI><a href="/eqshots/purplecape.jpg">Purple Cape</a></UL>Speaking of Fan Faire recaps, Steve let me know that the <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/fanfaire/scrapbook.jhtml">official EverQuest page's recap report</a> is now up and available to read.

Shalkai Windchaser sent the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings from Aven du Sora on the Innoruuk server!<br>We'll be hosting YAAP5 this Saturday, February 10th<br>at 6:30pm Pacific (9:30pm Eastern), in and around<br>Misty Thicket/Rivervale. YAAP5 is the fifth event in<br>the Young Adventurers Assistance Program. All races<br>are welcome and we will be stationed away from guards<br>for safety. <br><br>We'll have food, drink, buffs, and weapons available<br>for free for characters under 10 seasons. Armor for<br>all classes available for easy tasks. Magic items and<br>jewelry will also be given as rewards for simple<br>quests, games, races, and the like. Equipment will be<br>suitable for adventurers starting their careers:<br>expect fine steel, banded, raw silk and the like. If<br>you have Crafted Armor or a Charred Guardian Shield at<br>5 seasons, you've already had enough assistance :-). <br><br>There will be little quests and games throughout the<br>region. Swimmers brave enough (and fast enough) to go<br>through the pirahna pool will be well rewarded. And<br>where better to play hide-and-seek than Rivervale and<br>the Thicket?<br><br>We invite everyone to attend and enjoy the fun.  All<br>are welcome to join us and use their powers or extra<br>equipment to assist others. We'll have free alcoholic<br>beverages for all who want to imbibe and just relax<br>with the crowd. We'll make sure to have enough drink<br>so<br>we can find out if halflings really have greater<br>capacity...<br> <br>We hope to see you there!<br> <br>Shalkai Windchaser, Guildleader<br>Aven du Sora<br><a href="http://ads.eqhq.com">http://ads.eqhq.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for letting us know.

But I want to stress something here: This is not a fix, it's an enhancement. Making tracking more flexible is a distinct improvement geared toward rangers, and by no means a bug fix. <br><br>Howwl said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: c.

Jeff Butler even went so far as to call us "Hearty Outdoorsmen" to justify HP gains. I can see why some people would consider our HP buffing spells as a balancer, yet, they can be cast on anyone, thus negating any self gain. Please look into this issue more.]</i></font> <br><br>I can add this to the list. I, personally, am a bit reluctant to suggest a modification to any classes hit points, as they are very much the basis of the power of fighter types. But I'll list it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You got the casting time perfect. Now, you need to lower the level on it, reduce or change the resist check and reduce the mana cost.

You're giving me mixed signals on this. <br><br>Sunmoon wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I forgot to mention, you mentioned that some of the changes may act as nerfs and we all pretty much agree on one way you can nerf us. <br><br>Remove the DISARM skill.]</i></font> <br><br>*sigh* <br><br>Alright, I've been hearing this way too much lately. You're logic is flawed here in two places. <br><br>We are not hunting for nerfs. There is no need to toss up some sort of token nerf to distract us. The only nerfs we would want to make would be ones that are necessary to achieve balance. <br><br>And, well, if Disarm is as useless as you claim, then removing it wouldn't really be a nerf, now would it? <br><br>Oh, and it's not like Disarm is taking points from some other ability. Removing it would not suddenly free up points that would have to go into some other skill. That's not really how this whole thing works. <br><br>sasandra wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1.) raise dodge cap, the other defense skills are fine were they are, we aren't tanks but there is no way a warrior in full plate armor can out dodge a chain wearing class, rangers dodge cap should be the same as warriors, the other should not be changed.]</i></font><br> <br>Other than the defense cap itself, this would seem to be the most logical defense skill to increase for rangers. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5.)

This is from one of our designers: <br><br>--- <br><br>We've ran through the Evade mechanics I described yesterday, and made a few refinements. <br><br>If Evading while at the top of the hate list, you will still be moved between the current #2 and #3 person on the hate list. In addition, if the amount of hate reduction calculated is less than 500 actual points, it becomes 500. <br><br>This insures that Evade will always be at least as effective as Jolt, and it will mitigate the Multiple Rogue Syndrome many of you fear. Example: <br><br>Rogue1 has 10000 hate<br>Warrior2 has 9800 hate<br>Ranger3 has 9795 hate. <br><br>Using the formula (#2hate-#3hate)/2(+#3hate)=Rogue Evade hate, the Rogue1 would be set to #2 with 9798 hate. 2 points lower than the new #1 player, and 202 points lower than his initial hate. Sucks, doesn't it? <br><br>Since 202 is less than 500, the actual hate would be adjusted 500 points lower, setting Rogue1 to 9500 hate, which could actually move him lower than #3. Doesn't suck. <br><br>Now if the three players at the top of the list were all rogues, the rotation of the three would not be as likely, since each one of them drops by a minimum of 500 points, IF there are other non-rogue damage dealers around. The non-rogues are much more likely to claim top spot rather than the trio of rogues. Lets throw some more math out here for you: <br><br>Above example, Rogue1 just evaded, setting his hate to 9500. <br><br>Warrior2 is actually Rogue2, with 9800 points of hate, now the top spot. He evades, placing him between 9795 and 9500, which is 9648. 9800-9648 is only 152, so he is bumped down 500 to 9300. <br><br>Ranger3 is actually Rogue3. He is now in the top spot with 9795. He evades, placed between 9500 and 9300, to 9400. Again, less than 500, so he is moved to 9295. <br><br>Now, you say that Rogue1 at 9500 should be back on top of the hate list, right? <br><br>This could be the case, but you have to realize that while these three Evades were going on, there may well have been other damage dealers in the encounter who have exceeded 9500 hate. <br><br>Each time a string of rogues evades, it becomes more and more efficient for the evader, pushing them down to the point where they are eclipsed by the other damage dealers. <br><br>We're testing this out now, and so far it looks pretty good. <br><br>In addition, if Evading while not #1 (pre-Evade), your total hate is reduced by 10% [i]OR[/i] 500, whichever is greater, not to go below 128. <br><br>We've also looked a few more rogue issues, and expect to have them adjusted in the following weeks. None of these are promised, keep this in mind, but we are looking into them. <br><br>Reduction of Min Range for throwing weapons. Not a removal, but a reduction, to around 3-5 feet. Should make them easier to use. <br><br>Instill Doubt still on the same timer as it is currently, but allowing that first backstab or special attack to land after ID goes off. This will happen. Still rewards those of you with good timing. <br><br>Apply Poison putting the Rogue in kneel mode similar to bind wounds, and releasing him when complete. Great player idea, this will probably happen.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864.html"><b>Necromancer Talk</b></a><br>So let's talk about necromancers. <br><br>As with all the other threads, I want to talk about class balance here, not about bugs or epic weapons. You may certainly present bugs and concerns about the epic weapons, but they will not be the main concern of this thread. <br><br>Unlike the other threads, I have a fairly good list of ideas already garnered from several other posts to start us out. It is not complete, I'm sure. But it is certainly a good place to start our discussion. <br><br>Also, we are not looking to make necromancers any more effective at soloing than they already are. And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now. The primary issues that I see revolve around the battle with the boss monsters. But I certainly want to hear from necromancers with concerns about all levels of the game. And, once again, I have to warn you that since we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance. <br><br>Anyhow, here's what I have already. <br><br>Ignite Bones: Despite the coolness factor, this spell can't really be used on the big raids because it suddenly pulls the enemy out of range, and by the time you relocate your range, one warrior could conceivably have done more damage than the spell is going to do. The best solution is to make the skeleton match the monster, if we can find some way to do that. Fixing this one spell might solve a lot of concerns. If we can&#8217;t size the skeleton, then we probably should remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD. Note: Any change to this spell should also be made to Chill Bones (55). <br><br>Lifetaps: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters. If we are telling necromancers that they have a valid place at the final encounter because they can give mana to other casters, then they will need a way to regain mana. Lich and Lifetap are the way they do that now. I am not convinced that this is something that we should change. But this is the single most asked for thing by the necromancer community. Perhaps, if made in conjunction with the fixing the bug in Lich, then perhaps this could be balanced.<br><br>DoTs and corpse poofing: This affects everyone. Hopefully this is now much improved, but I&#8217;m not taking it off the list until I&#8217;m convinced it has been fixed.<br><br>Mana transfer: Again, if their &#8216;place&#8217; against the boss mob is to transfer mana, then perhaps we should allow them to do it at a better rate. A 2:1 transfer rate might be enough. I'm not at all certain that this should be done in conjunction with any change to Lifetaps in those encounters, though, as a change in one makes the other far more effective and might just be too much of a change. But this could certainly be considered if we fix the bug with the Lich spells.<br><br>Infusion: Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, they might actually cast this spell. Otherwise, those Essence Emerald&#8217;s will only be used for raising the dead. <br><br>Defoliation: There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on. I fully understand how we need to limit the use of any spell that is overly efficient against any one monster type. But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be. I've asked the players for a list that they'd like reviewed, but I've received nothing yet. <br><br>Track Corpse: Broken spell. Is it going to stay that way?<br><br>Epic Weapon: The look and effect are not well loved in the community.<br><br>Lich Series: This series of spells is broken. It is more powerful than it should be. It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana. It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'. Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players. This change also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2). This is a bug that we have chosen not to change in the past because it would be a 'nerf'. I think in conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, we should also look at this series and decide if we should put it right. If it remains as it is, the necromancer is going to be limited in the improvements it can gain, as the class is already using a powerful and broken spell series. Note: Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055083-2.html"><b>Necro Raids</b></a><br>Hi all. <br><br>I've just opened the Necromancer Talk thread. With as much reading as I've been doing lately, I can't keep up with all these threads. <br><br>So let's move this to the Necromancer Talk thread. PLEASE try to keep it concise and try not to repeat things that have already been written.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885.html"><b>Magician Talk</b></a><br>It's very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class. They can solo for their entire career fairly well. Because of their pets, they are welcome enough in any group, and at higher levels they get the Malo spell line that makes them even more welcome. There is some concern about the use of pets in higher level groups. Pathing in places can make them more of a danger than a help. And any creature with an AoE fear spell will exclude the use of magician pets. I'm not sure that these issues constitute any sort of imbalance, though. Fixing them, however, would most certainly eliminate any concern that magicians might have about having something to do in raids against the boss mob, or against the high hit point Velious monsters. Having powerful pets gives them the ability to contribute to the combat, regardless of the magic resistance of the monster, or the magicians available mana. <br><br>So, most of what is listed below are essentially minor. The issue of a change to the way rain spells work crosses several classes, though, and is the only real sweeping concern here. The change to the way link death and logging back in works hit magicians pretty hard. The tedium and expense of summoning new items when you go link dead is harsh. <br><br>No Rent Items: We all know what happened when we changed the way players log back into the servers after disconnect, and how that affected magicians (not to mention people holding no rent quest items). The most viable solution for this seems to be making No Rent items disappear on log in instead of log out, and only if the last log in time was more than 30 minutes prior. This would be a perfect solution (and one that I&#8217;ve heard the players suggest a few times).<br><br>Rain Spells: Can we remove the pets from the equation? Just this would probably make them useful without making them too useful. I've looked at the numbers, and adding more waves would probably overpower these spells by a large margin. We might want to look at the resistance on these spells, though. They may be too high.<br><br>New Summoned Proc&#8217;ing Weapons: With the recent changes to the status of pets (making them Pets instead of NPCs) and the fix to the way their weapons proc (and the &#8216;nerf&#8217; of the Sword of Runes) we also mentioned that we would be adding new proc&#8217;ing summoned weapons for them. Perhaps something like this could be a good way to introduce a few situational weapons. <br><br>Pathing: Any continuing improvement on pathing would be a great benefit to magicians. There are several places where the pathing, rather than the actual pet or the zone design intent, is bad enough to exclude the use of a pet.<br>Notes: Get specific zone examples where pathing is at its worst. <br><br>Pets and AoE fear: Pets are unwanted against any enemy that can cast an area of effect fear spell (and those are some of the more important encounters, at least emotionally), because the pet will always flee, and will often run directly into other monsters that the party does not want to engage. It might be nice to give magicians the ability to make their pets immune to fear for short periods of time. It could be debated about letting them make other pets immune to fear. And it will most certainly be expected by the players that immunity to fear would make more sense for necromancer pets than mage pets. But, as always, gameplay has to come before appearances. <br><br>Voceration: Fire and Greater Voceration: Fire: The claim is that these two pets do less damage than the level 29 fire pet. Are they really less useful than the 29th level pet? Can someone check? If it is, should it be? Perhaps another careful examination of these pets is in order&#8230; <br><br>Spell Drops: Could someone look into the 54th level Water Pet Spell (heck, all the 54th level pets) and Blizzard, just to see if they are dropping off the right level monsters? There is a rumor that the water pet is dropping off of lower level mobs in Skyfire. Is that really where it should drop? <br><br>Pet Names: How about letting players pick a pet name (just one per character) and have all of their pets named by that name. It would be no more likely to be abused than the naming of characters, and it would make people with pets much happier. Not to mention it would help diversify the landscape a bit. Or perhaps some other way to allow for more interesting names than the list they are randomly chosen from now.<br><br>Pet Graphics: How about a new graphic for high level magician and enchanter pets, something to match the spectre for the necros. At least can we look into getting an interesting look for the epic pet, something like the original appearance (this thing looked pretty cool the first time out, then something bad happened and it lost its cool looks)? <br><br>Rage of Zomm: How about making it look like a big fat Eye of Zomm? <br><br>DoTs: Why did we give magicians DoT's with Velious? It does seem a bit odd. <br><br>Dyzil's Deafening Decoy: The claim is that it doesn't actually seem to decoy very well. We should up its ability to taunt. I don&#8217;t see a reason that it can&#8217;t be a super taunter. With its low hit points, letting it taunt the heck out of things wouldn&#8217;t seem to overpower it. Though, if it&#8217;s going to be attacked so much maybe we should give it a few more hit points. Also (or maybe instead), perhaps making it more of an escape spell would be a good idea. Give it a very short casting time (2 seconds), so that magicians could summon it in bad situations real quick and then run like heck. (Summary of requests for this spell: A lot more taunt, more hit points, 2 second cast time).<br><br>Higher level pet healing spell: By giving them a better healing pet healing spell (a standard upgrade) at higher levels, we can force them to decide if they want to heal or summon a new one in a tight spot. The last one they get is at 20th level, I think. It&#8217;s a good spell line that seems worthy of continuation. <br><br>Improved Invisibility: Why don&#8217;t magicians get this spell? <br><br>Phantom Armor: Two concerns here. The first is that it uses 4 components! That&#8217;s an awful lot of components to carry around. It would be nice to make the component a single item that costs 4 (or even more) times as much. The second concern is that it is overwritten by Shield of Words. It seems to me that the 52nd level personal magician spell should hold over the 49th level cleric spell. Though the cleric spell seems to have more AC, the mage spell also give additional regen&#8230; <br><br>Aegis of Ro: The players think that this spell is more than rare, that it is not dropping at all. I've also been told by a very few players (one that I can think of) that it does indeed drop off a dragon in Dreadlands. Perhaps a slight increase in the drop rate on this spell would be good. (Note: Obviously we've fixed this one since I wrote this. This spell never was dropping, but is now.}<br><br>Pet Fear Immunity spell: One idea that came in during the necromancer thread spurred me to suggest this. Area of affect fear spells make pets unwanted in some places. How about we give magicians a spell that would allow them to make a pet immune to fear for a short while? (another note: See, the dev team DOES read these threads&#8230;)<br><br>Robe of Conjuration: Both necromancer and magician pantaloons (legs) for caster classes give them mana free level 50 pet buffs (Burnout III, Augment Death), but the necromancer robe has the level 57 Conjure corpse, while the Robe of Conjuration gives the level 49 damage shield. How about changing the magician leggings to the level 56 damage shield?<br><br>Pet Health Bars: It would be nice if the magician could see his pet's health bar at all times. Even better if every party member could see the health bars of all party pets. <br><br>Ok, keep in mind that this list was written a while ago. Obviously some of these items have already been added. And some of them really are not class balance issues (I wrote this up before the idea of starting the class balance threads even existed). So, please, let's only talk about these ideas (if you don't like them or think I've written them incorrectly) and new ones. But please keep in mind, if you know you've stated it before and it is not on this list, that's probably because I purposefully did not add it to the list&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055914.html"><b>Cleric and Warrior Bashing Thread</b></a><br>I'm going to lock this thread solely because of its unpleasant and abrasive title. But I also want you all to know that we will NOT be making warriors and/or clerics obsolete. And threads like this one, created solely to tell one class or another to shut up, are not beneficial to this board. Talk about the potential changes, that's great.

This is today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055204.html]</i></font><b>Servers Coming Down Tomorrow</b></a><br>You should check the scheduled downtime section of our web site for further details (it should be updated shortly).

We will be starting on with E'ci on Wednesday (7th), Innoruuk on Thursday (8th), and Fennin Ro on Friday (9th).

The only thing that the paladin has defensively that equals a warrior is the defense cap. Warriors have better armor, skills (like parry and riposte), and hit points. There is no doubt in my mind that a warrior will still be better defensively than a paladin after these changes. <br><br>Kalorad Valrexxaeus wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) We need a useful, big encounter, uber-mob purpose. We have none at the moment. My preference would be a defensive discipline such as riposte. We are by definition defensive tanks. Give us this ability.]</i></font> <br><br>I know that just a few lines up I said that paladins, even with the defense cap increase present on Test, are not the equal of warriors defensively, I am also not certain that they need any other defensive power. I&#8217;ll add this item to the list. But I am also going to suggest that we make no further changes in this area for a while, until we get a chance to see what affect the current improvements have. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Fix the level 60 Divine Strength buff, our ONLY useful high level buff, to stack with the level 50 Ranger buff. We need ONE good buff that makes us needed and makes us unique in that no other class has it. It has to stack with everything.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, I disagree. The stacking of this spell is going to have to be kept in line with the other spells. Making it stack with everything just to make it &#8216;special&#8217; for paladins isn&#8217;t a good reason. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) We need the ability to Stun high level mobs. We are the masters at stuns. No mobs above level 55 or 56 are stunable, i.e., the message says they are stunned but they do not stop beating on anyone, nor do they stop their spell casting.]</i></font> <br><br>I can add this to the list. Perhaps allowing more creatures to be stunned would help a few other classes at the higher levels, without being to unbalancing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) Raise our BASH skill. Also a disc to make BASH an unresistable stun IF it lands, i.e., to interrupt caster mobs, is highly needed.]</i></font> <br><br>I&#8217;m thinking that adding more disciplines isn&#8217;t a great idea. I&#8217;m reluctant to start stuffing in disciplines to fix things. But I&#8217;ll add it to the list, assuming that we do not do something like your number 3. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5) Reduce the reuse time of LOH post level 50. Make it gradually less until level 60. Make it a Complete Heal at level 60.]</i></font> <br><br>No. Look, LoH is good as it is. Perhaps an increase in its healing power is in order. But reducing the reuse time isn&#8217;t appropriate (it&#8217;s kind of the basis power for recast times), and Complete Heal is out of the question. I&#8217;ll add a suggestion for an increase in the healing power of LoH, but I think it&#8217;s fine as is. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6) Add Yaulp IV to our spells at level 59.]</i></font> <br><br>Hmmm... I&#8217;ll add it. But there is probably a reason it wasn&#8217;t added with the last changes. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7) Raise our TAUNT skill. Again, we are defensive tanks. It is currently too hard to taunt mobs off of classes which deal much more damage than us.]</i></font> <br><br>Every fighting class seems to want a better ability to taunt. Folks, taunt is a group thing, not an individual thing. Your group needs to be controlling their aggro. And we just can&#8217;t be setting it up so that any character can flip a switch to gain the attention of their enemy. <br><br>Again, I&#8217;ll add it to the list. But we&#8217;ll certainly have to look at this is relationship to everything else. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Where do i begin. Lets start with the appearance no offense but pally's dont look "epic" with just a hilt. The proc rate is for some reason lower than before and i have even saw procs as low as 1 and 2 damage. Something needs to be done.]</i></font> <br><br>The hilt thing is already on the programmer&#8217;s to-do list. I&#8217;ll add it to this list too. <br><br>I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve changed the actual proc rate of the weapon. <br><br>I&#8217;ll ask that someone look at the damage on this item. I&#8217;ll also add to the list of a suggestion that perhaps we change this effect to something defensive. <br><br>Scrith wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - raise the Paladin (and SK) Bash skill cap as high as Warriors. Rangers are as good at Archery as Warriors, why shouldn't Paladins be as good at Bashing? You can even argue that they should be better, since Paladins use shield MUCH more often than Warriors (unlike Archery, which is used by both Rangers and Warriors, yet they share the same skill).]</i></font> <br><br>Not better than warriors... but I can add that it be raised to match a warrior. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - give Paladins special shields which PROC something. Much like there are Ranger bows that proc when they hit, why not give Paladins shields that can proc? <br>- give Paladins critical hits on Bash. Rangers have it on Archery, how about finally giving Paladins (and SKs) a chance to get critical hits by putting them on our Bash skill? <br>- increase the likelihood of Bash stunning high level mobs. One of the biggest problems facing high-level Paladins (lvl 55+) is that our beloved Bash skill, which we have used and depended on so much since our earliest days, is no longer effective against high level mobs. <br>- please increase the AC on our shields...many of us are still using the same AC 25 shields we had before Kunark was released. Why have weapons (and armor) improved so dramatically since then, yet shields are still providing about the same AC? <br>- how about a new skill, called Blocking? When using a shield, it gives you a chance of blocking an opponent's attack (much like parry and dodge work). This would give Paladins (and SKs) a unique defensive skill that relies upon their role as shield-bearer.]</i></font> <br><br>In fact, most of this is similar to what shadow knights suggested. It certainly makes sense to suggest that these two classes have the same sort of skills. <br><br>ebob said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: One thing that concerns me is the recast times on certian spells. The one that I've had experiance with is Wave of Healing, our Level 55 Group heal spell. Why is the recast time on this spell 1 minute? I would see the reasoning behind a 1 minute cast time if the spell were to heal more than 200hp, but at 55, 200hp is 1-2 rounds of combat from any mob. I belive that this spell should have its recast time significantly reduced, or the amount of the heal increased.]</i></font> <br><br>I can add it to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Another thing that is of concern is the new 'Celestial Clensing' spell. Do you realize that it is a worse healing spell than Superior heal, with a higher recast time? The only advantage the spell has over Superior healing is that the first 110 hp will happen a few seconds sooner than the Superior heal will land. The added 30 second recast time just makes it even less useful. This spell should either cost very little mana, or heal for quite a few more ticks.]</i></font> <br><br>I can also add this to the list. But keep in mind we have a delicate balance to maintain here. We are already planning to look at upgrades for the two secondary healers. Too many healers will really impede the viability of clerics. <br><br>Vikki-the-Valorous wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is kind of a suggestion for all classes, not just Paladins. It involves 2 handed weapons. Now over the last few monthes or so you guys have been attempting to make 2h weapons more viable by giving weapons above 40 delay (rarely is there a worthwhile 1h weapon with above 40 delay) a higher damage cap. <br>My suggestion is instead of raising the maximum damage we can do, raise the minimum. The best idea I can think of at this time would be for the minimum slash/crush/pierce you could do with a 2h weapon would be the base damage of the weapon. For Example: Take a Razing Sword of Skarlon... 25 damage 40 delay... my Paladin has this ( not as my main weapon, but this is for example) and on average I do about 50ish damage a swing (not counting misses). But every once in awhile I'll swing for 16 or so damage.]</i></font> <br><br>Seems like a good idea to me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And, while not on the topic of balance, the Velious spell, Flame of Light, has no particle effect. You just pretty much make the movements like you're casting the spell, but no particle effect.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br>Seanen wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Defensive discipline, of course]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, I&#8217;ll add it to the list. Perhaps to replace Holy Forge (and with the suggestion that, perhaps, we might just allow paladins to get crits on undead naturally...). <br><br>Eliakim wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Disciplines - this topic will be covered many times in this thread by more knowledgable paladins so I won't say much other than paladins need a way to survive and contribute against uber mobs like Venthril Sathir, Trak, Kunark dragons, and the Velious boss mobs. Right now there's no real reason to have a paladin along on the raid. I advocate a shield block discipline equivalent to the Ranger parry discipline. The paladin would have to equip a shield to make it work.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br>TexasRanger said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1.) More 1HB/1HS and shield options. Many of our signature weapons, like the Messenger of the Queen, Soulfure, Firey Avenger, and Firey Defender are all 2 handers. If we are to be defensive hybrids, where are our shields? Why are so may Paladin only weapons 2 handers?]</i></font> <br><br>I've been thinking about this. I think what we need to do is determine who will primarily use what weapon combo, and lead them that way (by no means forcing them into those roles). I see that there are really three types of weapon combos, 2-handed, 1-handed and shield, and two weapons. Off the top of my head, I'd say 2-handers for shadow knights, weapon and shield for paladins, two weapons for warriors and bards&#8230; <br><br>In any case, this is probably something we should settle on and keep in mind for the future. It seems unlikely that we would actually change the Fiery Defender into some new weapon and shield combo at this point. But perhaps we can set some guidelines for the future. <br><br>Deringer wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  1. Celestial Level 59 improvement on Test is inconsequential: It has been shown that Superior Healing is better for less mana in every situation unless one where 110 hp before 4.5 seconds is necessary, in which case Divine Favor covers this. Celestial Line is supposed to be more mana efficient because of its over-time effect, yet this spell is LESS mana efficient than Superior Healing. Like every other Paladin spell, it has stacking issues. You do not need to nerf its hitpoints healed AS WELL AS its mana cost. Please reevaluate this spell, it is, in its current form, almost wholly useless, and at Level 59, laughable. <br>2. Divine Strength Spell is ARGUABLY not as good as storebought level 51 Ranger spell and DOES NOT stack. Make the Level 53 Paladin version 150 HP and the Level 60 version 300 HP, OR make them stack. Currently, this is a huge problem.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, I'll add a request to either increase the healing or reduce the mana on the new Celestial and to look at the stacking of Divine Strength. <br><br>Kithain wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: A larg enumber of people who play paladins want to play the perfectly noble and good knight. I know the erudites have a quest that involves them slaying a bridge builder (a quest better for an honorable rogue maybe) but ghoulbane is such an important weapon (leads to the epic) that it is really dificult for a Paladin to get one. In a game setting of high fantasy one should be allowed to play a purely good character who will not stain thier honor. If this was a White Wolf game of vampire with all its angst this quest would make more sense.]</i></font> <br><br>We could probably argue for pages about this&#8230; I could tell you that an honorable paladin would have absolutely no concern for gaining a weapon, especially if he was taking it from another noble creature&#8230; <br><br>But we won't do that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - Divine Glory (100hp buff at level 53). Grossly underpowered. Please consider that Rangers get Strength of Nature at level 51, which adds not only 75hp but an amazing 25 ATK, making it one of the best offensive buffs in the game. To be comparable in utility, you'd have to make Divine Glory about 200hp and 10ac, I think.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br>-Kleitus- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - Double check that our piercing skill is capped at the same level as our other weapon skills. If you're going to give us lances and spear based polearms then you should allow us to have the same skill caps or just forget about giving us the weapons. Lower skill caps in piercing would make the weapons less attractive for us in the end, especially with our lower skill caps in offense and weapon skills compared to other classes.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not sure that I agree.

This narrows the AC gap between hybrid and parent class.<br>2) Addition of Block Skill when a Shield is equipped (don?t know if this is possible to code, and seems too powerful to simply give the skill to the character if it can be used with a 2hS equipped). Block would be another defensive check the same as Parry, Dodge and Ripsote.<br>3) Failing the implementation of #2, raise other defensive skills as follows: Dodge 165 (10 under Warriors from 155), Parry 220 (10 under Warriors from 205).<br>4) Implement Critical/Crippling hits against Undead for Paladins. Warrior (parent class) crit against everything in melee. Rangers crit with archery. Implementing partial criticals makes sense with the parent/hybrid line of thought, and makes Paladins more fun to play.<br>5) Scale the Lay On Hands recycle timer based on level. Currently it?s 72 minutes per reset. Other disciplines scale down in time based on level, so this is not a request without precedent. I wouldn?t think a recycle time of between 30-40 minutes at level 55+ would be too much, and a scaling formula can be worked out between the current and the new once the team decides on a number.<br>6) Bash to 240-252 (0 to 12 over Warriors from 200). Paladins and SKs are the only two melee classes that use shields the majority of the time; so much so tank looking types with shields are automatically assumed to be a hybrid since ?real? tanks don?t use them. Clerics, Shamans and/or Druids sometimes use shields, but also sometimes use books or other items in the off hand. A maxed Bash skill makes sense for Paladins.<br>7) Disarm and Archery; both skills cap low enough to make them effectively useless. Assuming they are intended to do more than take up hot key slots and be a useful pulling tool, they should be raised to levels where they have more than a remote chance of being useful. Somewhere between 70/75 and the mid-upper 100s there?s a happy ground, I?m sure.<br>8) Add the Evasive Discipline at level 56, the Defensive Discipline at 60. Both should have 2/3rds the effects they do for Warriors (2/3rds of the missed/damage down percentage, 2/3rds duration); keep reset timers the same as for Warriors. <br>Spells<br>1) Move the Armor line down: Guard to 39, Armor of Faith to 49.<br>2) Move the Yaulp line down: Yaulp II to 30, Yaulp III to 39, Yaulp IV to 49.<br>3) Move Superior Healing from 57 to 53-54. Reduce fizzle rate in line with other previously noted comments on SH fizzles.<br>4) Add Remedy at 57-58.<br>5) Move Revive to 39, Resuscitate to 49, Resurrection to 56, Reviviscence to 59. The reason?s pretty basic. Travel spells are shared by two classes (Wizards and Druids). Damage Shields are shared by two classes (Druids and Mages). Primary Pets are shared by two classes (Mages and Necromancers). Speed spells (SoW) are shared by two classes (Druids and Shamans). All the ?market spells? are available from at least two separate class sources, those spells which are generally being sought after. Except Resurrections (specifically what people want when they want a Res, which is some of their lost time back in the form of returned death XP); Clerics are always preferred since they have the highest Res. Doubly so since 59+ Paladins are in such short supply. Granting the hybrid this ability of the parent (Cleric) would not impact the parent?s tactical abilities, only the support slot. And it brings parity to the market of spells we all eternally have varying needs for as we play the game. I haven't met a cleric yet that'd object to help in taking care of the eternal cries for 'Can anyone XP Rez?'<br>6) Change Divine Strength to a 300-350 HP buff (up from 200). Create a 200-215 HP version and place at level 55. Create a 100-105 HP version and place at level 50.<br>7) Addendum to #6 above, also add a Regeneration effect to the Divine Strength line. 3HP/Tick at 50, 5HP/Tick at 55, 7HP/Tick at 60. Maintain stacking with all current spells, including Natureskin, Divine Purpose, and druidic/shamanic Regeneration lines. <br>Equipment:<br>1) Add a ?Lichbane? 45-50+ version of Ghoulbane, appropriate for the level range it would be used in. Basically, an upgraded version of the popular mid level Paladin sword. The post that mentioned this idea and suggested it be yielded by questing to turn in Ghoulbane and Soulfire was a good way to go about it. If the ?sub-quest? to upgrade the sword idea could be implemented as well (where you do a quest for each temple in Norrath and get slight upgrades to your Lichbane, that?s a great idea that would end up with a final version Lichbane perhaps 10-15% better than the unquested version).<br>2) Implement additional Shields in game to address the rather sparse shield choices available to Paladins and Shadowknights who, again, are the only tanks using them. Between four and eight new shields would be excellent, with one to three of them coming in at or over 30 AC. Some of the new shields should be questable, some should be drop; hopefully there will be a division in the method used to introduce them into the game. Hopefully at least two or three of them will have useful and functional effects to consider as well.<br>3) Examine the class-specific weapons available in the game and note the numbers. Paladins are lacking in class-specific (1hS and 1hB especially) weapons compared to options available to other tank classes. A little on the quality side, but mostly on the availability side of the question. Broader selection would really help shake out the equipment options for the bulk of the Paladin class population.<br>4) Reexamine the Paladin Epic; is it comparable to other tank epic weapons? Why is it 2hS when many Paladins are using shields? Various suggestions already made adding additional quests that can be done to transfer a 2hS major quest or epic Paladin weapon into a sword/shield combo would be great additions after balance issues with the current offering are considered. <br>Combat Problems:<br>1) Unstunnable mobs are a real brick wall for Paladins. The Stun line is our single most combat effective line, the one that gives us the most mileage. Mobs where stuns are meaningless render a decent chunk of a Paladin?s combat effectiveness useless. Some encounters should be retained unstunnable for encounter/world balance reasons; others are perhaps able to be tuned down to keep Paladins in the game in these situations. Speaking personally, fighting mobs that cast but are unstunnable and uninterruptible generate intense feelings of hopelessness. To make an encounter difficult and require challenging use of skill is one thing; to make an encounter unalterable through any means is another.<br>Put another way; sometimes it?s good that you know the mob will get the complete heal off anyway. Other times, it just leaves you feeling useless at your inability to have any chance of doing something to counter that which is leading to your downfall.<br>2) The proposed spell on Test, Celestial Cleansing (110hp heal-over-time for four ticks, totaling 440hps healing at the end of the spell, with an additional tick waited before recasting) is a great way to let a Paladin heal while still staying engaged in the fight (skip a melee round to get the heal off on your fellow, then start swinging again the next while the healing kicks in). The problem are the numbers involved. At 59 mobs double for 110 on a really, really bad roll. The well documented severity of Velious raid-level encounters should adequately showcase the disparity between Test?s Celestial Cleansing and the amount of damage it?s being called upon to heal. The spell idea is solid however, if implemented in two or three versions and spread across the spell options for the Paladin. Move Celestial Cleansing to 50 or 51, where it can make a more measurable impact. Put in a 170-200hp/tick version at about 55, and a 225-300hp/tick version at about 60. The Mana/HP efficiency should be very comparable to that of ?normal? heals, as you?re trading away time to get more HPs later, and that should be a tradeoff respected in the costs associated with the spell.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, I know that was a long quote, sorry. I'm using these replies as the basis for building my lists, so I just decided to use this whole thing.

So don't worry about that. Just worry if I've missed a good idea. So please don't repost what you've already said, let's use this thread to move forward.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055465.html"><b>Rogue Talk, Part 2</b></a><br>Hi all. <br><br>Don't bother, I didn't even bring my wallet. I knew what sort of crowd I would be hanging out with&#8230; <br><br>I just popped in to let you know that I am going to start reading this thread shortly. But I'm also not the only one reading these threads. And I have a preliminary response from the team about the possible (and I repeat &#8211; possible) changes to be made to rogues (and, actually, some other classes as well): <br><br>We've decided on another tack for changing Evade. <br><br>Instead of setting you to 120 (current Evade), or reducing your total hate by 33% (our first intended change), this is what we are thinking of doing. <br><br>If the rogue is #1 on the hate list, a successful evade will lower his hate to a point between the 2nd and 3rd person on the hate list. <br><br>If the rogue is NOT #1 on the hate list, a successful evade will lower the total hate by a few percent, allowing "pre-evade" to remain a viable tactic. <br><br>At no time will Evade increase a rogue's hate, it will always reduce it. <br><br>Now for other changes: <br><br>Bind Wounds: Skill cap pre-50 for Warriors and Rogues was 100. We are likely to be moving this to 175, with a max skill of 210. This would mean a 70% binding well before 60th level. We're also adjusting other classes caps higher as well, but in reality, only Monks, Warriors and Rogues used Bind Wounds with any frequency, and only Pure Melee and Priests will be able to bind to 70% of maximum hit points. <br><br>Pick Pockets: Instead of a hard level cap at 45th for target NPCs, we're leaving it as it stands up to level 50 for the player. After a player is past 50th, it is (Player Level)-5 to set the level of an NPC whose pocket you can pick. All other pick pocket restrictions will remain in place, no magic or no-drop items can be purloined. So, to simplify this, at 60th you can steal from 55th or lower NPCs. <br><br>Instill Doubt/Backstab/Special Attacks. We are not going to change the functionality of this, but we are going to make Instill Doubt gray out backstab and vice versa until the timer has expired. This should make it easier to know when you can use the skill, and prevent a lot of dud Instill Doubt attempts. <br><br>We simply can't make stackable poisons without a great deal of coding, and we feel that poison as it stands now is workable. <br><br>Hide and Sneak through zonelines/logoff/linkdead is possible, but once again, will take a significant amount of coding and testing. We're not saying no to this, but we are also not promising that we will do it.</UL>

Those changes came about, mostly, from our folks reading the threads about the other hybrids and reading those about paladins that were started in preparation for this thread. Feel free to discuss those changes as well, though I think they are all very much in line with what is needed for the paladin. <br><br>Here's a list that I stole from Everlore&#8230; I was too lazy to actually look them up (but this list seems accurate): <br><br>a) Add Endure Magic spell at level 30<br>b) Add Resist Magic at 55<br>c) Move Guard spell from 49 to 39<br>d) Move Armor of Faith from 53 to 49<br>e) New level 53 paladin spell, Divine Glory, clone of divine strength but 100 hp instead of 200<br>f) New level 59 spell, Celestial Cleansing 110 hp healdot per tick, for 4 ticks. 1.5 second casting time. Recast time 30 secs.<br>g) Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors <br><br>So let's start the discussion. Please be detailed when explaining things. But at the same time, please be precise. I really don't need your background as a player, or detailed examples of gameplay (unless they are needed to explain a game mechanic). These threads get long, and anything that you folks can do to cut down the amount of text or increase the readability of the posts is appreciated. <br><br>And remember, we're primarily discussing 'balance' here. Bugs and such are fine to point out, but they are not the main reason we are here. <br><br>So let's hear what you have to say.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114.html"><b>Rogue Talk</b></a><br>Hello again. <br><br>This will be the thread for discussion about the rogue class. The idea is to look at the things that need to be changed to make the class 'balanced'. With that as the primary goal, I am still interested in hearing about bugs and other such things. But, primarily, I want to talk about balance. <br><br>My take on the rogue is pretty similar to that of the warrior. They are pretty well balanced. Obviously with EverQuest as a primarily player vs. environment game, some of the things that thieves traditionally do are not really part of the package. That's why, in EverQuest, they are titled rogues. <br><br>Again, I have had little time (actually, no time at all) to do research on rogue concerns before starting this thread. So please be as detailed as you need to be to get your point across. But, at the same time, please remember that this thread will get long. So being concise and readable is important too. <br><br>I do want to report one thing that we have already discovered internally about rogues that is broken and will be fixed when we make these changes. Yes, it is a nerf, but not in the true sense of the word. <br><br>In the old days, NPCs had a limited size to their hate-list (basically the way that they track who they are angry at). In those days, evade would just drop you to the bottom of that list. Recently we increased the size of that list dramatically. This allows us to do a lot more with NPCs. But evade was never changed to reflect this, so it still drops you to the bottom of the hate-list. Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone. The rogue can then beat the NPC up with impunity. Basically, evade is far too useful for avoiding aggro from an NPC, and we're going to change it to be more in line with its original function. <br><br>I wanted to let you know that at the outset. Please don't make it the focus of this thread. It&#8217;s certainly something we should talk about. But there are certainly other things that are worth discussion as well. <br><br>So let's hear what you think.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055080.html"><b>More on Fan Faire</b></a><br>Akriss-Ziller wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I don't know that either.....I will mention it to Abigale, maybe we can space the panels out when everyone comes to San Diego for the next one]</i></font><br><br>Dude! <br><br>There just is no way that one panel of two or three Verant people could answer questions from 1,200 people at once.

Keep a few things in mind here. Clerics get any shared healing spell many levels earlier than any other class. Clerics have a larger variety of healing spells to choose from, making them much more flexible in their healing powers. Clerics are also innately better healers than any other class. They will heal more hit points with the same spell than any other class (they have a built in bonus on all their healing). <br><br>I had the pleasure of talking to several clerics at the Faire. After talking with them in depth about this change, each of them was willing to admit that it seemed like a fair enough thing to do. Admittedly, they had their reservations, but they accepted the changes as probably a good thing for the game. <br><br>I wish some of you that disagree would have been able to come to the Faire and we could have talked about it in person. <br><br>But I am convinced that this is the right thing to do. And, from my skimming this post, I really see no arguments that validly suggest otherwise.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052938.html"><b>Verant Banning People Expressing Their Opinions?</b></a><br>ShockaZuulu wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I would like to know from a blue name if posting my thoughts strongly but not obscenely is now bannable.]</i></font> <br><br>Nope.

They will still have the best defense and offensive power (when compared to the hybrids). They will still have a significant hit point advantage. They will still have the best armor and weapons, and the greatest versatility in equipment. <br><br>Also, the changes you see are not likely to be the last.

There were a number of interesting things that took place that made this raid so unique.<br><br>-	The last server split took most if not all of our talented raid leaders and strategists, so Haemish, a Barbarian Warrior, whom at the tender age of 39 Seasons, took up the mantle of leadership by organizing and leading this raid.<br><br>-	The final raiding parties consisted of 8 groups ranging in level from 52 at the high end all the way to our lone bard at 37(who was critical in keeping the forward group alive long enough for the nukers to kill Vox).  All in all, the average level was about 46.<br><br>-	The servers went down halfway through the raid &#8211; but we regrouped and cleared the castle again for a second push and then launched our attack.<br><br>-	We did this raid with only 2, yep count em, 2 !!!! clerics (a 51 Vicar and a 40 Cleric) and 1 Bard.<br><br>-	The raiding parties consisted of players from a collection of over 15+ small to medium sized guilds that all belong to the Karana Council of Guilds.<br><br><br>Lady Vox was very generous on this raid and dropped the following (sadly no FA books for the Paladins):<br><br>(2) McVaxius&#8217; Horns of War &#8211; One defaulted to Merithment 37 of Illuminatus, and the other was won by Edina Elvandar of Haven of Light<br><br>Crystalline Spear &#8211; Tanniss Riverwinds - 51 Champion of Forever Knights<br><br>Staff of Forbidden Rites &#8211; Drusila (DRU) of Kindred of the Moon<br><br>Warhammer of the Divine Grace &#8211; Azuriem Angelgrace &#8211; 40 Cleric and Leader of guild Illuminatus<br><br>Tobrin&#8217;s Mystic Eyepatch &#8211; Morgail D&#8217;unistar - 51 Wizard of Fell Omen<br><br>King room loot &#8211; Vox Bracers to Salani (47 Warrior) and Crystalline Sword to Cretar (51 Ranger).  With all the talk of Magic and Cold resists &#8211; you can imagine how hot and heavy the rolling was for the Vox Bracer <chuckle>.<br><br>We also managed to retrieve 2 Prickly Pears for the Shadowknight Lifeleech spell quest won by Silver Daggers and Fell Omen to be passed down to their respective ranking Shadowknights AND, 2 Blocks of Permafrost &#8211; marking the beginning of the epic quests for 2 more of Karana&#8217;s Warriors.<br><br><br>The KCoG would like to publicly thank Jzonn and Halagar on Ayonae Ro, Steelheart of Avenging Crusaders, Solonel, and Jannelle Alcedonia of Ashborne, and Pippi Langstrump of Silver Daggers all of whom provided the new management team with assistance in planning, strategy, and execution of the raid.  Your advice and guidance in advance of this raid was the lynchpin of our success.<br><br>The Karana Council of Guilds is a loose community of dozens of small to medium size guilds.  The KCoG sponsors a variety of player driven events ranging from player run &#8220;Battle-Chess&#8221; type chess tournaments in Butcher Block, to low level Tournaments all the way on up to Planes and Dragon raids.

Brad McQuaid shed some more light on the changes coming to Donal's Breastplate in <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944.html">this thread he created</a> on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>I just read through Absor's post and the replies to it.<br>I wanted to clarify some things.<br><br>First, it didn't take 6 months and 300,000 people to find the problem. The problem was only made apparent recently, with Velious and the removal of the HP cap. The breastplate didn't appear as a problem until encounters started lasting much longer than they had previously. We made one attempt to address the issue, found out it wasn't nearly enough, and now are faced with having to do this change.<br><br>Removal of the HP cap added more variety to the game -- it changed strategies and tactics. No longer were we forced to simply make mobs kill in a very short period of time. Overall, this is a very good thing for the game -- variety and encounters that require differing tactics is good.<br><br>That said, whenever we do change or add behavior or other significant aspects of the game, other unforeseen problems often surface. It's the nature of the genre -- these game's change and evolve, and every change, small or large, can have unexpected ripple effects.<br><br>A second clarification: less than 5 or so mobs in Velious were created assuming the breastplate would be used, and this was mostly likely in error (i.e. we shouldn't have made that assumption in those cases). We will be addressing those mobs and tuning them down accordingly.<br><br>In summary, I'm sorry we goofed up -- it does happen. It will happen again. It's the nature of the beast, but we will always do our best to minimize these occurrences. And we will also do our best to react as fairly as possible when we are forced to act, attempting to do the right thing for both the individual player as well as the game as a whole.<br><br>It is unfortunate that the item was created in the first place, given its potential for problems, and it's also unfortunate that we didn't realize how much more magnified that problem would become when the HP cap was lifted. <br><br>That said, again, we're not perfect, and we will continue to make mistakes as long as this game continues to grow and evolve. And, no matter how dedicated our testing staff is, or how carefully we watch for problems on test, we will miss things that 300,000+ players will find. I don't see this changing, and I certainly don't think this is something unique to EQ, but rather something inherent to the genre -- no other type of game changes as often and as significantly, nor involves such a huge community of players who both work with and compete with each other.<br><br>I know that what I've said probably won't stop the flaming, and I know this is disappointing to both players who have the item as well as those who were planning on obtaining it one day -- I don't expect to post and have happiness follow -- but I did want to at least try to explain the situation in more detail, and to clarify it. And I also think it's important for us to try to manage expectations as they relate to the future.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

Brad <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052942.html">addressed a thread recently on the official boards</a> that requested a few answers about some issues the E'ci server is having:<UL>I really dont know if you can answer this but I still want to know what is being done about the NON-STOP LD problems on E'ci. We one time seen that verant recognizes there is a problem (maybe 2 months ago) and they say they are trying to resolve it but it is still happening all the time. So which is it? You guys cant figure out your own servers or your just not telling the truth? <br><br>Also since you might read this can you please comment on some of the mage issues that have been raised over and over and over again, (i.e. staff on inny)which for some reason just go ignored despite the mass quantities of requests by disgruntled magicians. At least SAY SOMETHIING!<br><br><b><i>We found some configuration problems with E'Ci, and corrected them.<br><br>We also very recently upgraded many of the servers that are part of E'Ci, Rathe, etc., with more RAM.<br><br>We found measurable improvement -- if you are still having problems, then we need more detailed information.<br><br>thanks,<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>

Brad McQuaid <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054508.html">stopped by a thread</a> on the Gameplay Board today that dealt with the surveys conducted by Verant:<UL>While I appreciate the fact you're conducting more surveys in order to get feedback on issues, it would be nice if it showed in the surveys that someone actually thinks before putting them out.<br><br>Look at the one running now. What kind of choice do you leave to those who aren't high level enough to go to Velious... We're supposed to either not know/not care, not having bought it or be dissatisfied? I know it's not a scientific survey by any means, but it could at least try and be a bit more on the significant side...<br><br><b><i>How would you re-word it? I thought it was pretty thorough. If you're not high enough level and you bought it anyway (for the UI, I assume), then let us know if you're satisfied or not.<br><br>If you didn't buy it and aren't high level enough, well, you didn't buy it -- let us know <br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>
