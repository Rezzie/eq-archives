I realize this was done to reduce clutter, but 2 hours is cutting it short. Some CR trips can take longer then that. If it was 3 or 4 hours that would be ALOT better.<br><br>Another limit that is EVEN worse! is the empty corpse super fast decay. I had a friend of mine die on a trip to Charduk, normally no big deal he was a cleric and we ran back over to do the res, but we got mobed at the entrance and he died again. However, because we have to run so far through Kunark we couldn't get back to the empty corpse before it decayed. He lost more then half a bubble of level 53 experience because of this.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I came from UO and I expect to lose everything when I die. In UO you have 15 mins to get rezzed, get back to your body, and hope something is left. I know this is not UO, but most of the danger of combat is lost for me in EQ. I know that when I die I have, to me it seams, forever and a day to get my body back. Knowing that no one can loot my items. I am glad there are some zones like this. So once I get high enough level I will get some of the danger that got my heart pounding in UO. I agree with EQ. If you do not want the danger then just do not go into that zone. I am glad they have these zones and reward players with great treasures for making it out of the zone with their lives.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Zanen end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Araskis -<br><br>In UO items of worth are not nearly as hard to get as those in EQ.  In UO you don't have to stay in one spot for 12+ hours straight in order to get a decent item, or spend months saving up platinum.  At lower levels sure, you could probably replace most of your items in a few days, but at 50+ it would take MONTHS to recover the items lost on your corpse.  This just isn't the case in UO.  Thus because it is much more difficult to actually get good items, it seems logical that more of a chance to get the items back should be available.  Also, although you lose skills in UO when you die (if you choose that options), it's not nearly as horrible as losing EXP in EQ.  EXP is the big penalty for dying, and the secondary penalty is the risk involved in recovering your corpse.  However, losing all your items that could take you MONTHS to explore just because you zoned into one of these zones seems a bit harsh to me.  Gordon said that the excitement of certain zones is the possiblity of corpse loss, but the truth of the matter is that once people figure out that certain zones have a very high potential to lose your corpse entirely, no one is going to be &quot;excited&quot; to go there - they are just going to avoid it!<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I'd really like you spend all year long getting items for your character and you lose them just because you TRIED TO EXPLORE SOMEWHERE NEW. That is complete B*@&amp; SH($. Verant designed places where nobody goes because you will die and lose your corpse. Theres nothing EXCITING about me fighting in a zone where I can lose my corpse.. In fact, Everquest has NEVER ONCE been exciting, Only interesting. I can't remember ONE time that my heart was pounding in EQ, However I can remember when I've gotten angry at EQ.<br><br>Verant.. You are just the stupidest people I have ever seen running a business. When the other games come in a tidal wave, EverQuest WILL DIE, All your profits, Your entire division, Will be swept up on shore and die of lack of water. Oh please, Do you expect your Star Wars game to save you? Fat chance.. The day you are all bankrupt, I will be laughing like hell.. Because you didn't put enough effort into the game to make people stay playing. You cant even REALIZE that you are about to go bankrupt. You know what I did recently? I reactivated my UO account. I see they have made some very good changes while I was gone.. And I had some fun playing. It is very sad Verant.. When I stop playing EQ and go back to UO. You people sicken me as you stand in your offices devising new ways to work as least as possible, and only adding to game balance. Do you even realize that every time someone loses ALL of their equipment due to corpse loss, THEY MOST LIKELY QUIT THE GAME. Not to mention that you are AGAINST corpse loss but PRO excitement that you might lose your corpse. LETS THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND.. Enough of this blood boiling one sided discussion, I am pinching to deactivate my account, And I am also pinching to play Ultima Online 2 (and one) And when I leave your game for the retail Ultima Online 2.. You won't have an overcrowding problem to deal with anymore.. However a new bankrupcy problem will arize. Good luck with your BSing until that happens.. Because I know for sure.. You havn't said one intelligent thing for quite a long time.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Maybe  next time you will explore a zone naked.  Leave all the stuff u can't lose in the bank.  Why do you need your primary equipment when your just looking around?   I made sure when I was exploring the new lands to leave all the stuff I could not live with out in the bank.  Maybe its time you guys started to use your heads instead of bitching every time something does not go your way.    If they did take out the corpse decay, you would be crying about how there are 100s of bodies at a zone because people think its neat to leave one  item on there corpse.    /petition &lt;cry&gt; why are there so many bodies at the zone, its making my PC slow down so much I died and loss  a full bar of exp  plase feel sorry for my stupidity and give me a full exp res :-(<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Your just about as good as Verant is. Hah.. Its so great.<br><br>You know, If everyone in the world was as smart as you, We would all end up starving to death because nobody felt like planting the crops.<br><br>You dont even look into the incident Nenwil, You just catch a glance and pour out your feelings.<br><br>And Badger.. How many times have I heard your &quot;go play AC&quot; arguement? Lets see, Countless times.. At least us &quot;whiners&quot; have something to whine about and all change what we say from time to time. You have the same old story, &quot;you dont like it, go play AC&quot;. Well its not as simple as that. Ive been playing the game for a while and put some effort into it, For all the to come crashing down.. I dont just figure &quot;OH DEWD ILL GO PLAY AC&quot;. I try and argue against it so it doesnt crash down. At least I have some fight in me. I bet if you were about to take the axe you would have more fight in you than what you currently have. You see a few people protesting against your game and you take the same old arguement &quot;go play AC&quot;. You know what? what im saying to you is also a tired old arguement about why Im not just going to play AC.. but at least its been mutated so that it doesnt get to be the same arguement.<br><br>No. You wont even understand what I am saying will you? Tough luck I guess. And no.. This isnt only a game.. This is a few people ruling over people and whatever they say goes. If I was to quit EQ, it would be a loss to what EQ could have been. EQ could have been good, But verants constant raping of the game has caused it to be horrible. And you do nothing to protest?<br><br>Enough.. You arent even listening, have fun letting Verant dictate your playing privelages.. Because when this finally falls on you, You wont just say &quot;OH OK ILL GO PLAY AC&quot;.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

EQ is basically the only thing worth play.  Verant is staring to have the same attitude that OSI has.  First off all of us EQplayers are wrong, and that Verant is correct.  So if there is really a problem in the game it takes like 2-3 weeks before anything is done to it.. Good example is  Spell drops for 50+ spells. <br><br>For a person to lose his corpse and equipment is lame.  All the effort and time is wasted.  I for one will quit EQ if that happend to me.  <br>The way some of the zones are set up. It takes more than 2 hours to do CR sometimes. Res time limit should also be extended.  I remember one time after they changed the pathing of Pats in PoFear it took us over 15 hours to do CR.. 24 hour limit is way to short and needs to be changed.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

You do not want to just go to SolB or Guk and get exp. You want adventure. Even though i agree that corpse loss should be in the game, it shouldnt be so soon. I've ALMOST lost my corpse (at lvl 45) because i had RL problems with ISP and couldnt even attempt to grab my corpse. This is not fun. So, stop saying shit about &quot;you dont have to go into those zones&quot;... You need to. You need to acquire knowledge/exp/items from that zone. Sucks that you clothe wearing EQ players think you know everything just because you've played UO or AC. All onlines games are different, And i think EQ is the hardest and most time consuming.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Then we would not have to listen to your childish bitching.  You just don't seem to understand anything about software development.  EQ is a huge program.  You comment &quot;You people sicken me as you stand in your offices devising new ways to work as least as possible, and only adding to game balance&quot; is so lame.  Do think that writing new code and placing it into the game is trivial?  The new code has to be tested re-tested and then tested again.  Patching software is a very delicate task and takes a lot of time and effort.  Get a clue and just be happy that there is a game called Everquest.  I applaud Verant for the awesome achievment that is Everquest.<br>As for the corpse decay issue, we all knew the rules about it when we started playing.  We may not like them but we agreed to play by them when we signed up.  Just because we are paying customers does not make the situation any different.  Fighting in the planes and other high level zones is like gambling.  Sure the possible rewards are great but the risk is also high.  You can't walk into a casino and gamble all you money away and then go whine to the casino owner that you just lost all your hard earned money that you have been working to get the past year cause the cards did not fall in your favor.  You don't like those rules don't gamble.  You don't like Verants policy don't play EQ.<br><br>Nuff said.<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

Every single player in our group (six of us) has played their character for over eight years, some more.<br><br>Whenever my party enters into unknown territory, say, a recently discovered forest that a king has commanded us to map, we don't go in with our fanciest, best gear. We take gear that will allow us to move quickly, and provide us with benefits not suited to heavy fighting, but instead to avoiding those fights. We've learned this from experience, as I've seen our party almost decimated when we tried a &quot;Gung-Ho&quot; approach - Going in, guns blazing.<br><br>Two: The army, when it wants to go into unknown territory, does not go in with heavy artillery, M1A2 Abrahm tanks, and Bradley light vehicles. Instead, they send only a few men in to reconnoiter the area, armed with light weapons - Not meant to fight, but instead to explore.<br><br>Moral? Don't go in looking for a fight if you're trying to explore. Take what equipment is best suited to exploring - That often isn't your best equipment (say, instead of a M-60 Machine gun, just use an M-4 Carbine), but is the best suited for the job. To do otherwise is to go against experience - Often not a wise choice.<br><br>Forgive me if any military references are inaccurate, I'm only an amateur military historian.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I am bar none one of the most Nuetral players on the server however you people need to wake up.  I was the FIRST 50 druid.  I have lost 2 corpses in that time.  Both where due to *super mobs* that (mind you this is one at 20 and one at 30) I could not contend with to get them back.  However I did not bitch or cry over it.  Yet you all whine about zones that time and time again Verant has said *these are &quot;super&quot; zones that you will recieve no help in* and you still manage to cram 30 + players into and die 5 to 7 times each.  What the hell is wrong with you people.  If there is no challenge or real risk what is the point???  You whine because Verant places rules in the game that SHOULD be listened to.  For instance.  Veeshans Peaks.... I HOPE AND I DO SERIOUSLY HOPE!  That the first bunch of morons to enter this zone and get slaughtered within seconds of zoning in lose their corpses.  I have no ill will toward any player on our server save two....  However.  If this zone is entered and this rule is broken.  I will likely give the game up.  It is just silly to put a zone in game with that much terror and not leave it at that.  Without a zone that I can go into and realize I HAVE to count on my guild and fellow players to do their BEST to survive in I don't think there is really any point in this game.  I am NO newbie.  I am likely (since damn near all other characters that actually beat me to 50 are sold off now, Carnuss being one of the few that I know of who are still out there.  Takako I think is still played by the same person...) the oldest player/character on the server.  So not a damn one of you can call me a newbie.  I will listen to reasonable objection, ignore the stupid *y3r n0t l33t d00d* comments and see where our server stands on the subject.  I however will enter that zone when I know I have my FULL guild behind me and what members *we as a guild* deem worthy of venturing with.  I know there are MANY of you that are not is SOTS that deserve to be on this raid.  When that day comes I will see you there.  For those that are just stupid enough to be lead into this zone with 30 players.... I do honestly hope your corpse rots... because doing stupid shit like that is ONLY deserving of a lost corpse.<br><br>All you spelling majors out there that are going to judge my IQ on what gramatical errors I have made... sorry.  I have a slight crown buzz on and don't honestly care.  Read what I wrote.  Figure out what words are what and get on with it.<br><br>Wynnter BitterKnight, First Druid to make a stand PRO corpse loss.....<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I am bar none one of the most Nuetral players on the server however you people need to wake up.  I was the FIRST 50 druid.  I have lost 2 corpses in that time.  Both where due to *super mobs* that (mind you this is one at 20 and one at 30) I could not contend with to get them back.  However I did not bitch or cry over it.  Yet you all whine about zones that time and time again Verant has said *these are &quot;super&quot; zones that you will recieve no help in* and you still manage to cram 30 + players into and die 5 to 7 times each.  What the hell is wrong with you people.  If there is no challenge or real risk what is the point???  You whine because Verant places rules in the game that SHOULD be listened to.  For instance.  Veeshans Peaks.... I HOPE AND I DO SERIOUSLY HOPE!  That the first bunch of morons to enter this zone and get slaughtered within seconds of zoning in lose their corpses.  I have no ill will toward any player on our server save two....  However.  If this zone is entered and this rule is broken.  I will likely give the game up.  It is just silly to put a zone in game with that much terror and not leave it at that.  Without a zone that I can go into and realize I HAVE to count on my guild and fellow players to do their BEST to survive in I don't think there is really any point in this game.  I am NO newbie.  I am likely (since damn near all other characters that actually beat me to 50 are sold off now) the oldest player/character on the server.  So not a damn one of you can call me a newbie.  I will listen to reasonable objection, ignore the stupid *y3r n0t l33t d00d* comments and see where our server stands on the subject.  I however will enter that zone when I know I have my FULL guild behind me and what members *we as a guild* deem worthy of venturing with.  I know there are MANY of you that are not is SOTS that deserve to be on this raid.  When that day comes I will see you there.  For those that are just stupid enough to be lead into this zone with 30 players.... I do honestly hope your corpse rots... because doing stupid stuff like that is ONLY deserving of a lost corpse.<br><br>All you spelling majors out there that are going to judge my IQ on what gramatical errors I have made... sorry.  I have a slight crown buzz on and don't honestly care.  Read what I wrote.  Figure out what words are what and get on with it.<br><br>Wynnter BitterKnight, First Druid to make a stand PRO corpse loss.....<!--ktalk end_comment-->

At least this is my take on it. Verant is conserned about your good time but... to verant obtaining items and retaining them is not the good time they had in mind. To them the game is not about geting items. Or about leveling. Its about adventure, fun, and advancement. They do not see trying to obtain all the best items as fun so they dont agree that you should have any extra time to preserve your items. Their vision is for a MMO Role Playing Game. You know for role playing. Now they understand that not every one understands roleplaying or wants to roleplay if they do. This is why they also try to cater to those who enjoy gathering items and trying to win the game by be comeing as powerfull as posible. However I belive that end the end their vision is of a roleplaying game.... and so is mine.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I also agree that the times for these should be extended though.  I'm not at a huge level by any means (32) but I must also agree with Overon.  Just finished an 8 hour camp of barely any exp for gatorscale leggings... only wis legs pre-plane in the game.  They are not exactly my most valuable piece that I have, but they are damn important considering I spent 8 hours doing nothing to get them.  I wish I could help you guys out on Tareww Marr and I wish you all good luck for the CR...  <br><br>If I lost my corpse, even at level 32 with 160 wis, (not that great) I would stop playing.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name DEEZ end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment--> Listen up people, if you all remember verant put a post in a patch stating that certain zones are REALLY difficult and you may lose you corpse forever. Infact<br>when the freakin game came out it even says in the manual that you may lose your corpse to lava and other instances. Now reading this it seems many of you simply <br>didn't bother to think what this exactally meant. You go into zones that you may have never been to and when you can't get your corpse back for whatever reason you <br>complain and BS to verant saying what are you gonna do about it. You have only yourselves to blame. I understand many hours are racked up getting xp and lewt but <br>this is one of the hardships and options for the PLAYERS who wish to challenge the fact that you may lose your corpse forever, and i'm sure the reward in zones like <br>veeshans peak are well deserved. If you are uncertain about a zone or don't think you have the manpower to take it don't go in no one is forcing you to, but be aware of what could happen. <br><br> On a side note bugs in zones suck and make CR even more difficult but with things like summon corpse/player it is POSSIBLE to get it back.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

They tried to zone back in for c/r and were all dead before they finished loading.<br><br>3)The GM said yes these mobs are not supposed to be here so I am killing them.<br><br>4)The GM then had the attitude of sorry you have no keys and died to mobs that shouldn't be here sucks to be you.<br><br>5)Verant has never stated Howling Stones was a zone no help would be given in. The Planes and Veeshan's peak are the 4 zones listed by Verant as limited to absolutely no help.<br><br>6)The quest mob for the key was not spawning for 5 days.<br><br>7)Bottom line the GM admitted the mobs were bugged and should not be there then refused to do more than kill the mobs. He should have killed the mobs and IMHO summoned the group cleric. If the GM did not wish to do this then they never should have told the party the mobs were bugged and not in the right spot.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

If your a player you risk it all and if you die and your corpse rots, you grit your teeth and live with it.  If your a wannabee you complain to Verant.  Just make sure in your rant you include the line &quot;I don't have as much talent to go into the high level zones so please give me my armor back&quot;.  <br><br>The problem with all you high level campers is that Verant allowed your no talent selfs to achieve level 50 by reducing the death penalty about 2 months after the game came out.  (It used to be that if you died you'd lose 1-2 bubbles  of experience, which is too much for most of you out there to overcome and successfully level, if it wasn't for Verant nerfing the death penalty your sorry selfs would still be level 35 stuck forever in hell level...hahaha)   So everyone who complains about losing their corpse, i say your a WANNABEE  NO EQ TALENT WHINING LITTLE DWARF. If you had any talent you'd have the backing and smarts to get any corpse back.  (although I haven't checked out Veeshan's Peak yet, but if I die..i'm a player..NO BIG DEAL) <!--ktalk end_comment-->

If the corpses didnt decay then we would never see the ground, as many times as we all die. Most people wont go back for a second naked corpse in their low levels...and just think we wouldn't even know what the priest of discord looooked like from all the bodies piled up around him from people creating characters just to run up and hit him for the fun of it.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

As all can see many have different opinions about this issue so I wil ljust give my opinion. I feel that this is a tragic thing. I feel that there should be some type of warning sign. If this game is based on AD&amp;D then there is a piece missing here. If I were to plan an evening with me buddies<br>I would ask 2 questions first. Where are we going and what type of place is it. Now lets go to AD&amp;D for a sec here. If my group was given a choice of dungeons to go into we would be given diferent ideas of what the dugeon we want to go into is like by the DM. If EQ is supposedly based on this game then they should provide the users with same info. Again this is my opinion only. Look at going into that dungeon as you were a human going out at night with your buddies.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

No others.<br>These are the players that take risks, lower than that, there is never any real risk no matter what.<br>If you spend 200 hours getting all of the &quot;uber&quot; items you want, to only go and try something fun in the game, and lose it all, can you honestly look back and say &quot;Oh man! That was FUN, lets do it again!&quot;<br>Neither does it add a feeling of &quot;risk&quot;, that comes from just plain dying and having to lose XP and time.<br>Now, about the bugged zone and npc part and lack of GM help, 3 words, WTF. I am mistaken or was this piece of software in a games store? Maybe it was in the business section, must have been, couldn't be a game. <br><br>-----<br><br>Disgruntled player: &quot;/petition, help! I lost my corpse in a zone that there is no way back into due a game bug!&quot;<br>GM Superdude: &quot;Sorry, this isn't a game, and either way, if I actually cared, I might help you, but NO!&quot; /ignore player<br>Player then quits and the situation resets until Verant's player base is worse than UO's.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

If there was a bug involved in the deaths of the group and not something in game i.e. anything that was programmed to happen as a result of the players actions/choices then i say let the corpses rot. A lvl 50 character is still a level 50 character and they probably have some plat in the bank to reequipped there character(of course it would be susbstandard to what they had before but it would be a start), however, if the circumstances of there death was beyond their control (bug) then they should have their corpses sommoned to them, their exp given back, and an apology saying that the bug will be fixed and they should not return to the zone until an announcement is made stating that the bug is fixed.  <br>    I am all for corpse loss but not if it was the result of a faulty program/bug or someother such thing that should not have happend in the game.

EQ is just a game buddy, if you can't live bye Verrants rules you should go else were. I have been playing for almost a year now and play when I have time. I have had a corpse decay on me when I went on vacation once but I did not let it stop me (char was only 31 at the time). If your going to play a game were corpse loss is a danger you have to face and you don't want to loses that corpse, just scout a head naked or with your non plane gear. Dam I remember reading post on the Howling stone 2 weeks ago plus when a rouge picked the lock and was killed instantly. I also think it said if u go in ivu the mobs won't argo on ya. In the end if you hate Verrant so  so much then stop supporting them with your monthly fee. I know all of us that can live with the rules would not be said to see you leave. Every time there is a small change, I read 100s of post about nerfing and crap, just adapt! <br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

Don't get me wrong, most level 10's (at least on my server) are pretty twinked and would not be fun to loose corpse with, but a higher level needs more time.<br>Perhaps changing the corpse time at say, level 35 onwards?

I really understand the ones which corpses are lost..and not to mention the items..<br>I think Verant really need to do something about the fact that you have to camp a spawn for like 100-200 hours just to get a item.<br>In this case the GM should..no he/she HAVE to remove the mobs guarding the corpses..AND he/she have to get the keys for the lock..Thats the players right, and im not saying the GM should give the players a exp res. they entered at their own free will, and therefore ,NO exp res, just a chance to get their items..i dont know how it is in the states , but here in Norway me have to pay roughly 1 dollar per hour online, plus the monthly fee to Verant, that is alot of money if i should have to camp for 100 hrs..(100*1=100$ plus the fee which is roughly 15$= alot of money)<br>heh, looks like i started a new thread here...well, anyway : tothe GM on that server: HELP THEM GET THEIR ITEMS!<br>I`m a 23 warrior and just because some of you here are high level (maybe arogant ba***rds) please dont come here and call me a nooobeee or anything..i have played three characters up to 20-25 before and that is the same as if i had one char. at 35-40th lvl..<br><br><br>Istbadulla Barkeeper 23rd lvl Barbarian Warrior on the Mithaniell Marr server.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email lyrnia@home.com end_email start_name Lyrnia Jongleur end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Hmmm<br><br>I see two separate issues here.   The folks who got stuck locked out of the zone due to the NPC who gives out the key not spawning were stuck because of a BUG and the GM should have helped them.<br><br>Now, on the topic of whether corpse decay times are too short I have to dissagree.  24 hours or 7 days is plenty of time to recover your corpse.  I played a Bard to 50 on test where just dying and getting your corpse stuck in a wall means you lost everything.  I dealt with this all the way to level 50.  There ARE no GM's on Test (or weren't then at any rate) to bail you out if you get in trouble.  It was also this way in Beta.  If you lost your corpse, owell, go get new stuff.  I still have fond memories of running around killing ultra-green stuff at level 35 to get cash to buy chainmail (there was no such thing as banded) so that I could go get real items again.<br><br>I'm also an avid AD&amp;D, RIFTS, Vampire, MAGE and many other role playing games player.  I love the risk and adventure.  The problem is that EQ is, by and large, an adventure game with role playing game tendancies.  In a ROLE PLAYING game death is permanent.  If you die your character is _gone_.  You learn to take risks only after carefull planning and coordination with your party members.  You learn not to take your best things with you because your party may have to strip your corpse in order to carry it to a cleric capable of ressurecting you (rare!)<br><br>In EQ 99% of the time Death is nothing more than a nuissance.  &quot;Ok, I died, lemme get a rez and we'll go kill that pest!&quot;  People camping out in the middle of lower guk because they know &quot;well someone can invis undead me so I can get out&quot;. <br><br>The problem isn't that death is trivial it's that the predominance of trivial deaths kind of jades us and makes us expect that death will always be relatively risk free.<br><br>I don't think the uber-zones are too dangerous.  I relish the danger.  I love going on planes runs but ya know what?  DONT take your best stuff.  In my bank is a complete set of backup armor.  It's not as good as what I wear normally but it's not bad either.  Instead of selling all kinds of stuff to other players when I get duplicates or slightly lesser powered items I save them.  I then wear that BACKUP armor when exploring a new place.  This is something that players should do on a regular basis, especially when going somewhere nobody has been yet.  I mean... there COULD be a dragon around that bend in the mountains, why on earth would you wear your best stuff when you don't know what lies ahead.<br><br>My take on death decay delays is:  They're fine as is.<br><br>My take on how the GM handled that particular situation is:  He should have given them keys so they could get back in since the key dropper was bugged.<br><br>So, in effect, the GAME is ok.  The GM goofed.  And I think because the GM goofed the player(s) who's corpses are stuck should be given help by the GM's to get to them.<br><br>Just my $2 (sorry this was so long, I ramble sometimes)<br><br>Lyrnia Jongleur - 40 Bard, Saryrn<br>Lyrnali Windsong - 51 Bard, Test<br>Lyrnia Windsong - 30 Bard - Beta 2, 3, 3.5, 4<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Fraus end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Alright, now for a post from a native English speaker...<br><br>Item One: We're in their world now. Verant has stated time and again that they will do what they feel is best for gameplay. While Verant does take players' suggestions into account, they typically ignore whines. So, if whining doesn't help, quit whining. Unfortunately, reasoned argument doesn't work, either, so we, the players, have to just suck it up and deal.<br><br>Item Two: As has been pointed out frequently, it's a game. EQ is not your job. Playing EQ doesn't feed your family. Your worth as a human being is not improved by playing EQ. EQ is there for you to have fun. When you stop having fun, stop playing. Rub your eyes, wander outside, and have a good ol' time under your friend, Mr. Sun.<br><br>Item Three: If you're frothing with rage as you read this, thinking that I just don't &quot;get it,&quot; think again. Do me a favor. Look up B.F. Skinner's work on irregular reward systems. Go ahead. I'll wait. Sound familiar? That's right! EQ is one big, random, irregular reward system, a system which Skinner noted as abnormally addicting. While you're at it, check out the theory of cognitive dissonance. Basically, a lot of high-level people aren't having as much fun as they used to, but they've invested so much time in their character that they can't let go.<br><br>It's a game.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Wayseeker end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->I recall either a /MOD or a post here from a Verant employee (likely Abashi) that even in Veeshan's Peak and the planes (which is not, incidentally, where this particular problem happened), if there was a BUG that caused death or made corpse retrieval impossible, it was supposed to be investigated and if found to be the cause, the situation amended in some fashion. Clearly there was a bug involving the MOB that drops the key, AND the monsters spawning at the zone so quickly. The GM in question confirmed such in a statement made to the players involved. But then did nothing to amend the problems, such as summoning a cleric to the corpse or giving the players keys to get their corpses.<br><br>So, my conclusion is that the GM was at fault per Verant's stated policy in this case. Unless somewhere along the line, Verant has said &quot;if the problem is caused by a bug, you're still shit out of luck,&quot; then the GM obviously goofed.<br><br>I agree with Lyrnia otherwise, as to corpse decay times (fine as is) and the danger-excitement of new areas. If it is too much danger for you to handle, simply don't go there. If you want to explore it, to assess the danger/risk, then don't go in with your best gear. If you want to roll-play as a berserker warrior and charge right in, go ahead, but accept the fact that you may be heading for (irreversible) doom.<br><br>Sadly though, as much debated as this topic is, I don't see Verant reversing the GMs decision on this matter. They've made their statements, so now their pride is at stake - thus they will stick to their guns this round. If they do surprise us and get those corpses back for the people involved, someone please post that information up.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name A Gamer end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->I remember when I made my first trip from Qyenos to Freeport almost a year ago.  I was all set to go then my traveling friend turned to me and asked me Why I was wearing my full banded and FS weapons when we don't know the way (hehe back then that was our best equipment, not to shabby for a lvl 10).  So I ran to the bank and spent a pp or 2 on some leather armor and got myself a rusty sword.    We did not die along the way but I did feel much  safer knowing all my nice stuff would be waiting for me if I lived or died.   I still do this to this day.  Ever time I explore a new area I set a hot key to /loc (just in case I am attacked and I can't win at least I will have the LOC of my body) and strip down to my secondary armor.     Its to bad these fellows did not get the same advice I did at lvl 10 but I don't see why they are blaming the gms.     Thems the breaks when u want to explore a new zone.  If you don't want to take em don't be the first to do it.  <br><br>BTW  I have lost a corpse before,  my nice twinked necro.  I was mad for about a day then I moved on, after all its just a game :-)  sorry for the rant<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name A Larper end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->I play EQ a lot. I am no newbie, having played the game for over a year now. I have a number of PC's with REALLY nice stuff, that I spent a good deal of time and/or plat getting. Although I would be distraught if my corpse would be lossed with any of them, it would not be the end of the world. I wonder at what type of little people with little lifes get so agitted over this sort of thing. EQ is a game, all games, to have any long term or endearing value to them, must include the chance of succes and the chance of loss. People don't seem to understand that.<br><br>Other then playing EverQuest, I LARP (Live Action Role Play). I have a level 10 rougeish sort Larping. As anyone else that LARPs most non-NERO LARP games can tell you, a level 10 PC represents around 1,000+ $ American in investments. Magic weapons aren't a dime a dozen, in game money is hard to come by, and deaths are a major pain. When I Larp, everytime I go out on an adventure, I have no clue what the risk will be. I am risking a milti-hundred dollar investment, and we don't have zone lines. I do this all the time still, and the risk, the real risk of losing items I have worked hard to achive, is one of the things that keeps it intresting.<br><br>So, I don't understand why people whine so much when they lose their stuff on EQ. Your level 40+ and you go someplace hard, might lose your stuff? Whaa. I bet you have at least 1 backup NICE weapon on the bank, and plenty of cash to purchase the best vendor sold armour for your class. I should also note that I play on a PvP server, and I've had some of the best loot I've owned go away in zones so 'dangerous' as EC, Nek forest, SK, NK, EK, ect... guess what.... I got more. Game was still playable, and that chalange, that increased chance of loss, is one of the things that makes PvP fun. <br><br>I dunno, just wanted to add that comment.<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

Tim says that all sony is trying to do is keep you from leveling.... <br><br>DUH! That is their job.. to keep the game interesting, it's no diffrent then saying &quot;the monsters in quake are there to keep you from finishing the next level! no fair!&quot; Again, people need to take a step back and think about things a little harder. What is good for the game.. dont think about what YOU want or what it hard for YOU but seriously, if you where in their place what would you do?  give everyone level 50 as soon as you kill your first named mob? No.. dieing is part of the game, looseing your stuff is part of the game, you people are lucky they even TOLD us that the zone would be a problem, if it where up to me, and I didnt have to deal with little brats that want to be handed everying, I would have just thrown in these &quot;super&quot; zones and then let the players figure it out for themselves.. RISK = REWARD. Whoever was calling me a newbie before? I'm level 53.. how about you? And your right, I dont have to worry about loosing my stuff because I'm not going to be stupid enough to wander in there with everything I own, if I go in there at all it will be totaly naked, or with bronze and a combine wep. <br><br>People, step back and think about what you want.. and what it would ultimatly do for the game.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I do not know what EQ is based on but on the internet muds, you were assured when you died you LOST a FULL level.  You had to double your exps to get to next level. If they want to complain about it then have an option when you first start your character.  <br>A: Lose 1/2 exps or a level or two and keep all your stuff.<br>or<br>B: Die and lose some exps and retrieve your body.<br>or<br>C: You get one(maybe 3) deaths per level. i.e. after you use up your lives. You character gets deleted and you start over.<br>or<br>D: Like regular D&amp;D, you die your dead.  Game Over.<br><br>Just though I had to put my 2 cents in, and from post 11 Overon, &quot;I am pinching to deactivate my account, And I am also pinching to play Ultima Online 2 (and one) And when I leave your game for the retail Ultima Online 2.. You won't have an overcrowding problem to deal with anymore..&quot;  With you leaving this game for &quot;RETAIL UO 2&quot; I dont think your the overcrowding issue and I dont think you have a following to make the population go down.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Star end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->I gotta say, this is some extremely poor customer service on Verant's part.  Now we all realize, that the customer is never right in &quot;your World&quot;, and we are just guests.  But the fact of the matter is, that many of us have made a Cyber-Home for ourselves in &quot;your&quot; little World. We have devoted countless hours to exploring, questing, camping, and completing many of the less than necessary tedious tasks of the game.  And lets face it, after a certain amount of hours online, Platinum Peices start to look like dollar bills.  We, in time, have become very attached to our mighty swords, flashy armor, and long flowing robes.  And with good reason, when it can take over a year to build up a character that can hold its own in this scary world.<br><br>So, when I saw this thread being discussed, I simply had to chime in and voice my opinion.  Recovering Bodies is ESSENTIAL. I left Ultima Online because I always lost my gear upon death. It was impossible to build up any self worth in their game. I feel Verant, also has been less than helpful concerning this issue.  I feel as if they are copping-out on this issue due to laziness or lack of desire to help the VERY same customers that have made all you people at Verant, Sony, and 989, very rich people.  You remember us, we are the same people that put up with the game's initial network problems, over a year ago. We are the same gamers that sat through countless server updates and fixes, in the month leading up the the expansion release. We are the same gamers that patiently waited to get shipped our Kunark expansion when you botched that up too.  We are the same gamers that stood up and said &quot;Ultima Online...You Suck!&quot;  And finally we are the same 250,000 gamers that played your game like fanatic banshees until you got yourselves noticed by LucasArts. And I'm not going to waste your time explaining just how important the LucasArts partnership is to you.  Just remember when your a bathing in a tub full of 100 dollar bills, that a couple of those bills came from the guy who is begging, and pleading for just an iota of assistance in retrieving their online life  ( their corpse). <br><br>In closing, I'd like to add that I started playing Everquest on the second day of it's public release over one year ago. If I were to ever loose or get my gear stolen from my main character, I would leave Everquest and never return again. The betrayal would be to much.  Please Verant don't continue to betray your loyal customers, even though we are in &quot;your world now&quot;.<br><br>Thanks kindly for your time, and any consideration you may give to this crucial issue.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>The Star of Eci<br><br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

Now the policy is your corpse will rot in thiry minutes if you're under 5th level and within 24 hours on-line/7 days offline if 5th level or higher. The 24 hour/7 day period are congruent, meaning if you stay on-line for 12 hours, you now have 3.5 days to retrieve your corpse. This was a big oversight on their part.<br><br>Now to the main discusion, all Verant would have to do is move a few MOB's away from the zone entrance to allow players to zone through, summon corpse, RES corpse, leave zone...if a player takes three to four steps into the zone, then let the MOB's jump them...but for all of Norrath's sake, move the MOB's back some so players can get their corpses summoned and ressed.<br><br>-Docter Stormfist<br>Dwarven Cleric<br>Officer of the Dogs of War<br>Tarew Marr<br>Head of the &quot;Cherub as Pets for Clerics&quot; movement<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Overon end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Fraus has it very right. But what I feel is that I put some time into this game, I have some friends in this game, And We all liked playing this game. Verants continual rape of it causes me to hate them.<br><br>As you might expect.. There is nothing interesting to do in real life. Most of my real life friends play EQ. Recently, Over and Over again, It has just not been any more fun.<br><br>As for you people talking about &quot;you probably have spare armor in the bank and can recover&quot; You can't. You never can replace your armor.. And your bank isnt big enough to put backup sets of armor and such in.<br><br>EQ wasn't designed to give you the ability to recoil from losing all your items.. Verant probably didn't even realize it. But I don't care anymore.<br><br>The bottom line is.. All the people who have sided with Verant so far are either Ignorant of how hard it is to get your corpse back, Or just plane stupid and cant realize that Verants &quot;vision&quot; is not a stable entity.<br><br>Perhaps if you stupid people would actually listen to this and squeeze it in, you might understand. (doubtful that you will but I'm gunna say it anyway)<br><br>Verant has stated time and time again that character loss is not good in EQ, they dont like it at all. But their &quot;Vision&quot; of the game has shifted to allow corpse loss. Now.. Please. Corpse loss, Is character loss. I am afraid you are going to have to trust me on this one. If you lose your corpse.. You lose your character. A level 50 with leather armor and well balanced weapons is not nearly as powerful as one who worked for their equipment, and therefore, wont go anywhere in advancement in a long long time until they slowly get items back.<br><br>Verants &quot;vision&quot; is just an excuse to use whenever they run into something they cant explain to us. If we come up with something they will say its part of their &quot;Vision&quot;. Let me explain, All zones created (before an upgrade) You had no risk of losing your corpse. But then they began opening new zones that started having risks of losing your corpse. Why would they ever do something like that? They completely changed their mind on weather or not your corpse should rot and you lose everything. (believe me losing everything on your corpse after one day isnt something you can just recoil from). They just felt like changing their mind.<br><br>For 7 days.. a corpse will stay. 7 days offline that is. And if you lose your corpse on a monday, People have busy lives and arent going to help you till maybe saturday or friday (if they even do that). And with such a hard to break zone, People dont have days to spend doing this tedious job. They go back to their lives, and lose everything on their corpse.<br><br>In UO, losing everything on your corpse was just fine. You could easily get back to the status you once were just by spending a small fraction of the money you had and buying new items to fight with. But in EQ.. Where they have LONG camps and RARE spawns that take days upon days of camping time in game just to get an item.. You lose your items, And you lose a lot of effort.<br>Now..<br>Verant has stated they dont like corpses rotting. Yet they are very happy having the &quot;excitement&quot; that if I go in here and die my corpse will rot. I dont even care about MY opinion on the excitement thing.. But by them saying one thing like &quot;We dont like corpses rotting&quot; and then doing another thing like &quot;We like the excitement of maybe your corpse will rot&quot; and then implementing into the game chances for your corpse to rot. They are just going against their own statement.<br><br>They say one thing, and do another.. Anti corpse loss, Pro excitement of corpses maybe being lost. Well guess what Verant.. Corpses will be lost, You might have some of that excitement, But you will also have corpse loss (something your against). (I'm not talking to Verant anymore.. Thats it)<br><br>Now.. After all that (which you didnt even read) How do you feel about verants &quot;vision&quot;? (at least nobody incompitant will reply to this, because its too boring to read)<br><br>Thanks..<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Overon end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Oh, Did I forget to mention.<br><br>&quot;<br>But in EQ.. Where they have LONG camps and RARE spawns that take days upon days of camping time in game just to get an item.. You lose your items, And you lose a lot of effort.&quot;<br><br>Why do you think they have made so many rare spawns? Well.. To keep you playing of course. You want that rare item, You take forever to get it. If you get it in one day, Whats the point of that? So you spend forever trying to get it, and forever doing nothing but sitting on your ass in the game.<br><br>Verant now makes corpses lose so that when you finally get that item and go WOOHOO I got it, You have a chance to lose it and have to go get it again. They dont realize how many people stop playing when they lose their corpse, But anyway.<br><br>Want to hear why Verant is stupid? Allow me to comment more.<br><br>&quot;So you spend forever trying to get it, and forever doing nothing but sitting on your ass in the game.&quot;<br><br>THIS is what makes Verant stupid. Instead of making the items rare and fun to get. They make them rare and annoying as hell to get. If they were to add things to the game that were fun to do, and you get the items, then getting your items would be fun! And thats the whole reason for playing? Fun? But instead, They have you sitting there forever with you and maybe 2 other people, camping something you can easily take, Over and over again, until you finally get the item. Is that fun? No. Same goes for rare spawns wandering around the zone, even worse for them. You spend forever sitting there, days and days just waiting to get that one thing to come up and kill it. Well, Sitting and doing nothing isnt fun, and this is what they did in the game.<br><br>If Verant was just more creative, They could have devised fun ways to get items, but still have them be rare so that there was a point to get them. But they arent creative, and like I said before, They don't like to work. Oh, And comment to Thelselas in message 23.. I dont like responding to people who dont know what they are talking about but, You dont know how hard it is to run a game either, and you act like you do. Well I have seen many other games out there, And I have seen what Verant is doing.<br><br>Verant releases things into the game that are bugged when they could easily have done a 5 minute test to see if it was bugged or not. Does that sound like effort to you? No.. Its not effort. They havn't upgraded the 3D engine in EQ like other games have to keep up with the times. They made the Kunark zones look better, But they are really laggy because EQs 3D isnt up with the times. If it was, They would have new ways to filter out the lag of the 3D cards and make EQ run more smoothly (and even look better). Verant is a horrible company, They have made bug after bug and done stupid thing after stupid thing. Trust me, They have. I wont list them all, Because I'd be here forever, But they have, Check up on it and you will see. And based on this evidance, Yes, I am saying EverQuest is a bad game and they could have done a lot better if the man managing it cared about quality. Does Brad even play EQ? No, he has a level 20 ranger he never plays, One should take PRIDE in his work and play EverQuest when he can, because he made it, and he is proud of his creation. Brad isn't proud, He doesn't have the feeling that they are doing something he would enjoy, because he doesn't play EQ. And don't think he is too busy to play EQ, Can you see all the mistakes they have been making, and how they dont test anything? Well don't tell me they are working their asses off. When I play a game, I want to commend the creators for making it, and give them a pat on the back, and say Good job. When I play EQ, All I see is laziness. Their whole priority list shows they are lazy. They could add a /drag option for corpses, But they don't because they are lazy and dont wan't to implement it. So they spend 5 minutes typing up &quot;Well you should trust the corpse dragger not to loot it&quot; .. Typical BS. Verant is lazy, Verant doesnt have that sense of quality, the sense that they are actually doing it right, Because they have no effort into making a game they love.<br><br>Flame me all you want.. Theres nothing you can post there to say that Verant is doing a good job when they have repetatively shown that they arent. If you don't believe they are doing a bad job, Then trust me on this.. Please trust me, You are wrong, and you have to investigate into this much further to see.<br><br>Of course, you probably don't have the effort to investigate, and I don't blame you because It isn't fun, But if you want to, Go ahead. I just don't like seeing Verant control the players with BS messages and Priority Lists. If they wanted to make a great game they loved, They could, But they have no effort, So they don't.<br><br>Thank you again..<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email The Soerbaird end_email start_name Tamboran Ratamacue end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Here is my two cents on the subject.<br><br>On this specific incident, the GM handled it poorly, and should be dealt with.<br><br>Now, I do have to say that I think that the corpse recovery stuff is okay.  I have played in a three year campaign of Vampire: The Masquerade - it was a LARP (Live Action Role Playing game) and we played once a month.  I spent three years building up my characters, and building up my stats.  I had one of the most powerful characters in the game.  Then, one night, about 20 minutes after the game started, I was jumped, and put into torpor.  I was then killed.<br><br>The storyteller took all of my item cards (&quot;phat lewt&quot;) away.<br><br>I spent three years developing my character, getting the real cool items, and it was all taken away because I was careless and was jumped.  I had no way to go &quot;retrieve my corpse&quot;.  I was dead.  It was something I knew was going to happen.<br><br>Was I upset?  YES.  I left the game that night.  However, I did come back the next month and started brand new.<br><br>So, if there is NO DANGER in going to an uncharted area, then what is the point?  When I DM or ST (depending on the campaign/chronicle I'm running), if the party goes into an unknown area with guns blazing, I am going to probably kill them. :)  Use a little bit of strategy, and you may limit the loss of the items on your corpse.<br><br>Oh, and by the way, when I was at E3, I saw the entryway to Veeshan's Peak as a teaser from one of the developers.  I cannot WAIT to see the whiners start posting on the boards when they get in there, because of where you zone in.  I don't want to ruin the surprise any more than that.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

And it's not your fault, it's probably mine.  You're talking about me taking the whipping that Verant is dishing out...Really?  Just because they made parts of the game uber-difficult and requiring strategy?  Just because it's not Quake with Swords?  (If you want that, play Daikatana...OH WAIT it's never coming out)<br><br>I'm sorry that some people can't take things like a man (or woman).  In this particular instance I do feel for the party because the GM screwed them over (due to the key thing).  That situation is not a CR-time problem, it's a GM/Customer Service problem, which Verant needs to deal with.<br><br>But I bet you'll twist those words to say that I have no compassion towards other players of the game.<br><br>I guess I just got matured in the realm of game playing to accept &quot;Permanent Death&quot;.  And, according to you, that is exactly why I should not post on these boards.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Your acting like &quot;Well Verant is doing stuff That really sucks? Oh well thats what they do and I will take it like a man&quot; And that is just rediculious.<br><br>Its like someone in 20 below weather trying to act cool and &quot;manly&quot; by not wearing a jacket and showing how strong he is by resisting the cold when hes really freezing his ass off and getting sick from it.<br><br>People complain because this change was a stupid move by Verant and their policies just switch around to whatever they want them to be reguardless of your imput, and you just have to &quot;take it like a man&quot; do you? In that case, To you, If something goes wrong, Don't protest against it, You'r weaker if you protest against it and &quot;less of a man&quot;.. I'd hate to prove you wrong, But by letting verant make these changes to their once claimed not wanting character / item loss, and you just taking it, you are less of a man by allowing them to change such a drastic aspect of the game that they once felt as a bad thing. Not to mention the real reason why they are doing it, Not the BS one they have been feeding the public.<br><br>You probably dont understand.. But if you do.. Then good, Start protesting against Verant for having whatever &quot;Vision&quot; they feel like having based on a daily decision of weather or not they like something.<!--ktalk end_comment-->
