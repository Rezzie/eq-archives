The talented, daring and dashing Crispin of Fennin Ro has a tale to share with us:<BLOCKQUOTE>Good day citizens of Norrath! <br><br>A few minutes ago, the first band of adventurers traveled to the recently re-discovered isle of Kunark.  The first people on Fennin Ro to set foot on Finonia Vie were Vegeetta, Minara, Azyzik, Cloudstorm and of course yours truly.<br><br>The remainder of my report will be hidden, meaning you must highlight the white area below with your cursor to view it.  I daresay I would not want to spoil all the surprises that will await you in Kunark.<br><br><font color="white"><i>The journey began at the Faydwer Docks close to the Dwarven city of Kaladim.  Six small shuttles were docked neatly in a row.  These shuttles could only carry a few people at time, but none the less they seemed capable of standing the voyage.  Upon boarding them, we waited for additional reinforcements and prepared to get underway.<br><br>A few minutes later the shuttles were launched and headed to the unknown, departing what was then the known world.  <br><br>Time seemed to freeze as we crossed the borders.  When time returned to normal my sharp elven eyes tried to penetrate at the fog ahead.  As we pushed forward it became clear that there was a massive object in front of us.  The size of this object can only be described as unworldly at best.  As we drew nearer it became apparent what it was.<br><br>Having sailed on all the known boats that exist on Norrath, my breath was taken away as I stared bleakly at the most impressive warship my eyes had ever beheld.  The Elven armies had spared no expense for this mighty ship of war.  The shuttles slowly came about and circled the ship halfway giving us a spectacular view of the massive ship.<br><br>The shuttles slowly docked one at time, allowing us to board the ship. When everything was secured the sails were unfolded and we got underway.  The voyage wasn't short, but thanks to the vessel's speed we crossed the distance of the ocean quickly.<br><br>At last we arrived at the newly opened elven outpost of Firiona Via.  We quickly disembarked and crossed the long length of the dock to set foot on the isle outpost.  <br><br>A kind enchanter named Azyzik volunteered to bind the entire group to the outpost.  <br><br>Feeling glad to have set foot on solid land once again, I gazed round about me to get a better feeling of my new surroundings.  Despite the announcement issued by the League of Bards, this outpost seemed to be under construction still.  Buildings were still being built, and the gates hardly seemed able to keep out invaders.  As I wandered out to the perimeter, other people were stocking up on supplies at the nearby vendors and some were even engaging in new quests.  As I scouted my surroundings, I quickly discovered that leaving the gates of the outpost would be foolish.  As a 13th season Ranger, I would have no chance of surviving any kind of encounter with the gruesome creatures lay ahead.  I was marooned.</font></i><br><br>Crouching down to the earth, I contemplated what my next move would be on this dangerous, but exciting new frontier.<br><br>Crispin<br>Ranger of Tunare<br>13th Season<br>Fennin Ro<br><UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/leavingfaydwer.jpg">Leaving Faydwer</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/leavingfaydwer2.jpg">Leaving Faydwer, Part 2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/theunknown.jpg">Drifting in the Unknown</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/objectahead.jpg">Object Ahead!</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/voyage1.jpg">Docking with Mothership</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/massive.jpg">A Ship of Massive Size</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/arrivingatport.jpg">Arriving at Port</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/defenseweapon2.jpg">A defensive weapon</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/thefrontier.jpg">The Unknown Frontier</a></UL></blockquote>Check out those screenshots, several are high resolution shots with little or no compression.  <br><br>Good luck, Crispin!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
I just spotted the following Patch Message annoucning several things Kunark-related.  This is a must-read for all players:<UL>April 24th, 6:00am<br>-------------------<br><br>***Press Release***<br><br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br><br>LEAGUE OF ANTONICAN BARDS ANNOUNCE NEW MAIL ROUTE<br><br>FIRIONA VIE, Kunark.  February 1, 3178--<br><br>Today, the League of Antonican Bards, responsible for maintaining communication across Norrath announced that they have established a mail route to the newly discovered continent of Kunark, located across the ocean, south and east of Antonica. The new route will carry mail from Port Faydwer to the Elven outpost of Firiona Vie, which will serve as main port-of-entry and battle staging grounds for adventurers arriving in the new lands.  <br><br>The outpost of Firiona Vie was established soon after word reached King Tearis Thex, King of Felwithe and leader of the Koada`Dal, that his daughter of the same name had been kidnapped by lizard creatures now known to be named the Iksar.  The King commissioned Galeth Veredeth, once-Lord and High Paladin of Tunare, to establish the outpost on Kunark and return his daughter to him, lest Veredeth's life be forfeited for failure.  "I cannot allow those vile creatures to keep my daughter and only heir to the Koada`Dal throne from fulfilling her destiny," says King Tearis Thex. "Galeth Veredeth had best not fail me."<br><br>A high level source in Neriak confirmed today that the Dark races will not be outdone in the endeavor to acquire new territory and power.  The source said, "We believe that this nonsense about a kidnapped princess is just that.  If the lesser `Dals and their human and stunted playthings think that they can wander the new lands unchecked, they are quite mistaken."<br><br>Many adventures are already beginning the trip to Kunark, a journey that is not without its perils. A human and halfling party was apparently slaughtered upon their arrival after mistakenly boarding a Kunark-destined ship in the Oasis of Marr.  They evidently were not aware that the ship would arrive at a new port, firmly controlled by Neriak and their brutish muscle from Oggok and Grobb.  <br><br>Druidic scouts have reported that there are some strange phenomena present throughout the new lands.  "The land appears to have been ravaged by some viscous magical storms at one time," said one follower of Karana. "Some magics that we have come to count on just do not work."  This phenomenon was apparently noticed to an extreme in the vicinity of a mountain peak rumored to be inhabited by followers of Veeshan.  "Only through divine intervention did I escape that place with my life."<br><br>The League of Antonican Bards' representative in Kunark met with Galeth Veredeth, Governor of the Outpost Firiona Via.  "It is my sincerest hope that many adventures loyal to the King will assist us on our Quest to return the Princess to her home," says Veredeth. "Though the dangers in these new lands are formidable, I have no doubt that many will come, if for nothing else than to reap the spoils." <br><br>					#	#	#<br><br><br>*Kunark Goes Live*<br><br>In case the announcement from the League of Antonican Bards wasn't to your liking, we are very pleased to announce that the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark expansion has been implemented on the live servers.  Adventurers who have installed the expansion and registered their account key may now visit the new lands, exceed level 50, create Iksar characters, and access Kunark-related content in general. <br><br>Here is a short list of some of the new features available to those who have upgraded:<br><br>- Players may now reach level 60!<br>- Over two dozen new zones to explore!<br>- Tons of new quests, items, and spells to complete, acquire, and learn!<br>- All-new creatures and weapons, with new art too!<br><br>There are two minor issue that is known and that we are still in the process of rectifying: Action-based sounds for the Iksar and some other Kunark creatures are still being worked on.  In other words, you might hear a giant mosquito "walk" by you, and your Iksar might sound curiously like a human when he is hit with a sword. In addition, there is some additional work required with a couple of the starting Iksar quests.  This may cause you to reach a point where you cannot proceed further in a quest.  This will not however cause you to turn in items and be denied your reward, so feel free to explore these new quests.  We will be finishing them over the next week.<br><br>We would like to offer special thanks everyone who has been patient over the past couple of weeks while we've readied EverQuest for this awesome event.  It has been quite a challenge for our team to get everything ready for launch, and your support has been instrumental in this process.  We'd also like to thank the beta test team, who in the face of all of the new content managed to keep their thoughts between themselves and the Dev Team, while working to make the game better for everyone.  <br><br>If you ordered Kunark on or before 4/19/2000 and do not receive your Kunark CD by today, we will be posting instructions later today on how to claim the shipping refund as well as the free month of EverQuest promised last week. <br><br>Thank you,<br><br>The EverQuest Team<br><br>April 24th, 6:01am<br>-------------------<br><br>*K-Patch Required*<br><br>All Kunark-enabled players should run the Kunark Patch on the Patch Program control panel prior to attempting to enter Kunark.<br><br>*Manual Supplement*<br><br>The files named everquest_manual.doc and everquest_manual.txt in your EverQuest directory are now obsolete.  Downloaded to you today are two new files, labeled EQROKSupplement.doc (MS-Word '97 Format) and EQROKSupplement.txt (Text Only).  These files are supplements to the manual distributed with the retail version of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark.  For those who upgraded, PDF files of the manual will be placed on the official EverQuest web-site at www.everquest.com. A new patch message will announce their availability.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

As of this writing it is 9:23AM CST.  I just spent thirty minutes running to the docks and Kaladim to discover the newly created Shuttles.  After waiting about five minutes the all the small shuttles took off.  A very cool sight it was seeing the would-be invasion force depart from the known world on such little transports.  <br><br>After sailing around the zone for a while the shuttles stopped and everyone was teleported back to Butchers Block.<br><br>I have had some reports of new (non-beta testers) players being able to create Iksar, but after trying it myself I had no success.

Firiona Vie, Sionachie, Thubr Axebringer, Sir Jevik Isqual, Al`Kabor,<br>Dreezil Pocketdip, Dagda Icefury, Ognit Eznertob, Dabner Drednever, and<br>Lyirae Oakwynd arrived at the tiny Elven stronghold in the new lands. Tired<br>from their journey, they stepped off of the Maiden's Voyage and began to<br>rest for a few moments.  Galeth Veredeth came to greet them as they were<br>resting. <br><br>Galeth Veredeth shouts  "Lieutenant Thorn! Please do me the honor of taking<br>our friends on a tour of the surrounding area" <br><br>The Lieutenant approached the group and began to lead them out of town.  As<br>they were walking along, the Lieutenant made an effort to point out the<br>creatures and structures to Firiona and her companions.  He informed them<br>that the Iksar are an ancient race. The ruins that lie all about the land<br>show that the Iksar were a great empire whose influence seemed to stretch<br>the length of the continent. 1900 years ago, the Iksar attempted to attack<br>and take control of Faydwer but the navy was wiped out by a terrible storm<br>and they were not successful. Something terrible happened to cause the once<br>great empire to crumble.  None of the local inhabitants of the area seem<br>very friendly with the exception being the Drixies. <br><br>As the party began to walk back, Danak Dhorentath, an Iksar shaman shouted<br>"Visitors! Watch your backs, the Drolvarg are attacking!"  At that moment,<br>four Drolvarg appeared and ambushed the group.  Danak and an Iksar Initiate<br>joined the group in fighting the Drolvarg. After the Drolvarg were dead,<br>Danak asked if everyone was alright. <br><br>While Firiona was explaining to Danak that they were seeking out the Ring<br>of Scale, he seemed generally concerned for their safety.  He told them<br>that their journey would be incredibly long and dangerous. Danak offered a<br>quicker means for them to get there.  He offered the use of his special<br>portal.  Within a few moments, with serpentine speed, Danak Dhorentath<br>grabbed Firiona Vie by the arm. Taking her by surprise he pulled her into<br>the gate, which disappeared with a hiss leaving nothing more than the smell<br>of ozone hanging in the air. <br><br> "I must return and tell King Thex the terrible news. Bind the vile Iksar<br>at once! Dagda, Thubr, Jevik and I will escort the prisoner back to the<br>mainland!" Galeth Veredeth shouted. <br><br>They escorted the Initiate to the Maiden's Voyage and traveled to Faydwer. <UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen01.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen02.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen03.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen04.jpg">Screenshot #4</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen05.jpg">Screenshot #5</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen06.jpg">Screenshot #6</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen07.jpg">Screenshot #7</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen08.jpg">Screenshot #8</a></UL><br>

A commotion erupts near the warm campfires in the cave leading to Halas. A<br>pair of gnomes scurry out into the cold carrying odd looking equipment.<br>Ognit Eznertob and Dabner Drednever are hurrying to finish setting up a new<br>device they have created while their friend Dagda Icefury gather her<br>kindred to come and experience this life changing revolution. <br>  <br>Dagda Icefury shouts, "Come and see my brothers and sisters! My friends<br>have made for us a device that will keep us warm on the frigid tundra!<br>Follow me and see this wonderful invention! We shall never know cold again! " <br><br>Once the crowd has gathered around, Dabner turns on the Portable Heater.<br>The sound of a mighty explosion rolls across the tundra. Animals stop dead<br>in their tracks in fear as the shockwave passes by.  The device is a little<br>broken and begins to spout out flames at those nearby.  While Ognit and<br>Dabner argue about whether or not the blueprints were followed correctly,<br>Dagda jumps up on the igloo where the machine sets and begins to destroy<br>it.  She looks toward Dabner and says "Not a word from you wizard. This<br>thing must be destroyed. It is a danger to us all!"  Ognit and Dabner<br>continue to argue about who is to blame for the malfunction. <br><br>The winds howl a mournful song. Firiona Vie, the Chosen of Tunare, makes<br>her way slowly across the frozen ground. Flanking her are her companions,<br>their faces drawn and somber.  Dagda, Ognit and Dabner walk over toward<br>Firiona Vie and her companions.  As Dagda gets closer to Firiona, the fair<br>maiden's staff brushes the barbarian's arm.  The touch of her staff,<br>Lifeguide, brings memories back to Dagda. <br><br>"I've come to ask the three of you for your help." Firiona graciously<br>pleads to them  "The task set before us is difficult and the road we must<br>travel deadly. And I truly know not what the future has in store for all of<br>us."  She informs them of Lorisyn Oakwynd's death and introduces them to<br>his twin sister, Lyirae Oakwynd.  Dagda, Ognit and Dabner agree to journey<br>with them. <br><br>Fighting against the raging blizzard, their faces drawn and determined,<br>they disappear into the furious storm.  Firiona Vie, Sionachie, Thubr<br>Axebringer, Dreezil Pocketdip, Sir Jevik Isqual, Al`Kabor, Dagda Icefury,<br>Ognit Eznertob, Dabner Drednever, and Lyirae Oakwynd set forth on their<br>journey to the new lands to confront the Ring of Scale.<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV3screen1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV3screen2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a></UL>

Gordon Wrinn left a news comment on yesterday's EQVault newspost "More on 2Hand Damage Description."  Here's the thread:<br><UL>I don't know about anyone else but I have not noticed any damage increase per hit. My 13th lev ogre warrior is still hitting for 29 hp max damage. Now maybe what those comments by verant mean is that they increased the frequency of attempts to hit, but that is not clear to me. And if this is so, that the frequency of swings so to speak has been increased it is not noticeable to me. <br><br><b><i>I doubt that you'd notice much at level 13. It's on a curve that increases with level. It will be much more noticable at the higher levels. <br><br>Gordon Wrinn</b></i></UL>Thanks Gordon!

I received the following from Aolan:<BLOCKQUOTE>As many of you have already noticed a brand new edition has been added to the Rodcet Nife server. No, the event has not yet begun but we are still awaiting new members. The event will begin on Saturday the 29th of April. It will be a royal rumble where everyone in the arena decimates their surroundings. It will be held at the Qeynos Arena. Currently, there are very few members and the only way you can participate in the once a week EQWF will be to either find one of the posts on the message boards, talk to me on EverQuest, or email me at sonrise@together.net <br> <br>Every player will have a record for themselves and the first week will only begin with a royal rumble. Weeks after the 29th there will be many more events such as 1 vs. 1 duels, handicap matches, ladder matches, etc... A story line will be incorporated into each of these. Do not fear dying, this is a fun addition to the server. Please join and have fun!<br>  <br>-Aolan<br>Human Magician Level 17<br>The Rodcet Nife Server<br> <br>P.S.<br>Please go here for full information: <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5496915">http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5496915</a></BLOCKQUOTE>

While visiting the Gameplay Board this evening I spotted the following post that Gordon made:<UL>If damage is (as Abashi has said it should be) calculated by damage/dly ratio, why do 2h weapons ALWAYS have a VASTLY superior ratio to 1h weapons?<br><br><b><i>Because you can't dual wield when wielding a 2H weapon. The damage and delays mentioned were completely arbitrary and were just listed to make the problem understandable by everyone. The problem itself is entirely mathematical.<br><br>The problem as I explained it is that IF a person wields a 1H weapon of an equal ratio to a 2H weapon, they will do more damage with the 1H weapon than with the 2H weapon just by virtue of it being faster. The margin was fairly large, and was reduced by the changes announced the other day. <br><br>This is still true, but not to the large margin that it was. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

These screenshots and the text are from quests being done right now, which are leading up to the re-discovery of the continent of Kunark.

Today, the battle rests,<br>and the Festival of Faydark's Children shall be held!" Elves begin to<br>emerge from their huts atop the Tree City of Kelethin, and from the small<br>valley leading into the Butcherblock Mountains, a small band of dwarves<br>marches into the forest. A mule pulling a wagon carrying three large<br>barrels, each the height of an elf and the width of a dwarf, follows<br>closely behind the dwarves. <br><br>King Tearis Thex, the high elven king, welcomes everyone to the celebration. <br><br>"During this past year the Mother has shown much generosity and to our<br>people. The restoration of my daughter and your princess, Firiona Vie, has<br>been only the crown of the Mother's gifts to us this year.  To all of you,<br>I give my best wishes and though I am your King, it is not necessarily I<br>who has brought you here today. It is your hearts, your spirits. the very<br>things that make you of the Fier`Dal and Koada`Dal nations, that have<br>brought you here.  To you, I raise my glass. May your blades prove strong,<br>your bows aim true, your hearts remain pure and The Mother, may she bless<br>you with every year being twice as good as the past. To old friends." <br><br>Firiona Vie, Thubr Axebringer, and Sionachie reunite with their friend from<br>long ago, Lorisyn Oakwynd.  They also receive the wonderful news of the<br>existence of Lorisyn's twin sister, Lyirae Oakwynd.  They all take part in<br>the celebration of the Faydark. <br><br>The moment the King retired back to Felwithe, a band of villains disrupted<br>the celebration.  Ghargin Bumblok, an ogre shaman, and a troll warrior by<br>the name of Rogkasth were led by Vahlai Ka`Izal from the Teir`Dal.  These<br>villains came to kill Lorisyn Oakwynd.  Once Lorisyn was dead, they warned<br>Firiona Vie that this was not the last they will see of them.

An amazing <a href="http://www.gamefan.com/hotinfo.asp?s=6335&rs=">35 screenshots from RoK</a> have been posted on Game Fan.  Here's an excerpt from the page:<UL>The story flows well in the game and enhances all of the immediate surroundings. The fallen empire of Kunark has remains in every zone--haunted ruins that were once fortresses, towering bridges run over by goblins, mystical swamplands now controlled by cooperating frogloks and carniverous plants and desert islands inhabited by angry King Kong-sized gorillas. Such diversity and expansive horizons made my little exploration quite an adventure, and stimulated thought on what event (or wrath) of God could have destroyed this empire. Expect for the same to happen to you, as the grounds that inhabit Kunark are most curious, and encourage some adventuring.</UL>Thanks Jasen!

From Zierr Greyhawk:<br><BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings! <br><br>         Over the last year my friends and I have been producing fan fiction <br>films for the Internet. Some as class projects, some for fun. Since we all <br>love EverQuest, making a fan-film on it is something we all are very excited <br>about. One of the things we like to do prior to starting work on a film is to <br>create a short demo clip to see what kind of support and interest we can pull <br>in.  Last week we spent a day, ran out and made the following film as our <br>demo. It is very rough, and really was done in less than a day with equipment <br>we had on hand. Basically it is just for us to get a feel for the setting. I <br>would like to encourage people to download it and take a look. You will need <br>the newer version of QuickTime to play it. <br><br>     If you enjoy it, we would love hear comments about making a fan film <br>baised on Everquest. Right now we are starting work on the script, and <br>starting to think of ideas for locations and sets. Since it is fan fiction, <br>we have a near zero budget for the film. If we receive enough positive <br>replies then we will go ahead with the fan-film. In which case we will also <br>be looking for actors and EverQuest players around the Atlanta area to help <br>out with some of the bigger scenes. <br><br>  Keep in mind, as fan-fiction this means the movie will be released on the <br>Internet freely.  It is nonprofit and does not represent the views or work <br>from Sony, or any of the makers of EverQuest. Most companies don't mind <br>fan-fiction projects on the product, however if requested by the makers of EQ <br>we will stop this project.<br><br>Scott Zier<br>(Zierr Greyhawk, Quellious)<br>Source Entertainment<br><a href="mailto:SourceEQ@aol.com">SourceEQ@aol.com</a><br></BLOCKQUOTE>You can grab the <a href="http://vnfiles.ign.com/everquest/Tales_320.mov">Fan Fiction Movie here</a> (9.0 Megs).
