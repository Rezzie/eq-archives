Here's the last few posts Gordon Wrinn made on the official forums before he left on holiday:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010504.html"><b>Camping, Nerfs</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Well guess what Abashi, the nerfs have only created more problems than fixed, with out things to solo, noone can do anything without a group and when all of teh groups everywhere are saying "I am full" then I WANT MY MONEY BACK! I pay to play this game not to sit around for hours begging to play from people i do not even know or people i do not even PAY TO PLAY!]</i></font> <br><br>Hello again Robert, <br><br>I hope that you'll appreciate my being blunt. I'm not really sure that I can tell you. The groups "everywhere" are not saying "I am full". The groups in 3 areas in the game, known to be heavily camped, are telling you "I am full". You might consider going someplace that isn't known to be heavily camped. You might consider trying to form a group of your own. <br><br>Also, considering that you are level 48, do you not have any friends online who will invite you to their group? For instance, most people jump on line, check the friends list, find out where everyone is, and go join a friend. Do you not have any friends who make room and time for you? <br><br>Last week you chose to do something very dangerous without the support of friends or a cleric and were upset when you died. This week you chose to go to 3 areas famous for being crowded/camped. You keep choosing to set yourself up for failure, and then cast blame upon the game. <br><br>The game is designed to punish people who run into dangerous areas ill-prepared. The game is supposed to motivate people to go places less crowded with more opportunities by only supporting so many people in a given area. The game is supposed to reward people for making friends who will bend over backwards for them. <br><br>The game is working fine in the situations that you've brought up. The best advice that I can offer is that you step outside the box and try doing something different from what "everyone else" does. I think that if you look around, you can probably find other people who went to Lower Guk, Karnor's, and Rathe Mountains that night and had the same problem that you did. Try hooking up with those folks and going someplace else. <br><br>On a slightly different note, make friends with people. Go out of your way to help others out. They'll remember it, and will make room for you when you need a hand. So often I hear from people who primarily solo from 1 to 50 or so and then get upset that no one will group with them for the harder encounters. No one wants to walk into a level 40+ dungeon with someone who is having their first dungeon experience. Grouping skills and relationships are formed early on.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010503.html"><b>More Roleplaying Server Issues</b></a><br>I really think that there must be more to this story. Any time I see something presented that makes it appear that the action taken by a CS Rep was so blatantly wrong, I have to question what really happened. Afterall, were it so clear when it occurred, there's no way that the person would have been warned. <br><br>You have the story quoted, so I'm assuming it was written by someone else. Please have the author kick me his station name at gwrinn@verant.com. I'd like to look into it.<br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When the forum_faq came out and I saw they'd removed the initials for Role Play, calling EverQuest a MMOG (as opposed to MMORPG), it just confirmed what I already knew]</i></font> <br><br>You're reading a bit too much into it. <br><br>And MMOG is just a broader description of what we make. Yes, EverQuest is an MMORPG. Sovereign will be a MMORTS. We have a MMOAG (action game) in development that we haven't announced yet (other than the fact that we have one in development). We have a couple other MMORPGs in development as well. Whether MMORPG, MMORTS, MMOAG, or MMO-anything, they are all MMOGs, and that's what we do.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010497.html"><b>New Server Debate</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Items become more common, high levels become more common, and everything begins to lose it's value, especially gameplay.]</i></font> <br><br>The last two "new" servers are still hanging around 1400-1500 users at peak (Morrell and Torvonnilus I believe). These environments are still pretty young when compared to some of the original servers. You might consider trying them out. <br><br>I am surprised to see the quote above. We've been saying for a long time that the presitige and fun garnered from acquiring an item is inversely proportional to it's availability. It is nice to see that someone agrees :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010379.html"><b>Ports On Single Players</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi... is it possible to make ports castable on single players?]</i></font> <br><br>It is possible to do this, however it's not really what we had in mind for teleportation. Wizards and Druids are supposed to take others to the destination, not send them to the destination. The power of teleportation is in the druid/wizard, and they just have the ability to extend their aura, if you will, to include others. <br><br>It's not likely that we would implement this.</UL>

While mostly focusing on Ultima Online's volunteer policies, I thought it might be interesting to point out <a href="http://avault.com/articles/getarticle.asp?name=smurfs">AVault's recent article</a> on the effects an AOL lawsuit is having on the MMORPG genre.  For those who haven't been following it, this exceprt will help bring you up to speed:<UL>No one is more reliant on volunteer labor than the massively multiplayer online games. The three largest online fantasy role-playing titles, EverQuest, Ultima Online and Asheron's Call, use them as their first line of customer service. But maybe not for long. On Monday, August 28, representatives of Ultima Online's makers, Origin Systems Inc. (OSI), announced the termination of free game account privileges for hundreds of community volunteers. In a letter to the community, external support coordinator Matt Gutierrez wrote: "Due to changes in the industry regarding volunteers, effective Sept. 30, 2000, OSI will no longer provide free player accounts or other added value to members of all [Ultima Online] Volunteer Programs." <br><br>While company representatives have not said so outright, it appears the move to eliminate what amounted to a $10 a month gratuity for volunteers is related to a recent New York class action lawsuit, brought by former volunteers at America Online (AOL). The plaintiffs are claiming that AOL's practice of relying on what it calls "community leaders" to produce, maintain and moderate online content was tantamount to employment, and hence is covered by American minimum wage laws. (Origin's parent company, Electronic Arts, has exclusive rights to AOL game content.) </UL>

Here's ths morning's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010371.html"><b>Boards, Board and more Boards</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi has the board really changed at all?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, yes, I believe that they have. It really wasn't our intention to suppress the expression of ideas, but rather the way those ideas are expressed. I'm happy to see cases of name-calling, profanity, and general flaming severely reduced, as those are NEVER necessary in order to express an idea. <br><br>The fact that the boards have been clearing up has let us do some things that were impossible before: Get more Verant people here posting. While I remain the spokesperson if you will, I'm happy that we're able to get Rowyl, Ester, Hobart, Chris, Yakat....howeveryouspellit, here helping answer questions and such. Overall I think it's been a real boon for communication.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010400.html"><b>/Rand Can Be Hacked?</b></a><br>I'm not sure when this happened, but you might want to look very close to whatever text string was coming up and compare that to the real thing. People usually use a long /say or /emote to give the impression of a /random. The programmers have made /random 100% serverside, which means that it cannot be hacked.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010320.html"><b>Rogue's Weapons</b></a><br>Dazzler, there's nothing wrong with the weapons usable by rogues. As for that caster weapon you mentioned, it's a joke, and I think everyone is well aware of that. There is no pure caster who's coming anywhere near any melee class in melee damage. I'd hazard a guess that your rogue is outdamaging some casters in average combat. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010363.html"><b>"Where have all the dragons gone?"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Guess what? The dragon just despawned! Right into thin air... Humm.]</i></font> <br><br>It think that it will take a bit of strategy, not to mention alacrity, to take on these encounters. Yes, they are rare spawns, and they depop if they haven't been killed in a certain amount of time. Don't worry, they won't depop while they are fighting. <br><br>If anything, I consider this format better for all than that of Vox and Nagafen. Vox and Nagafen are routinely killed as soon as the servers come up which makes it hard for some people to participate. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What for?

Left unenforced, the environment on that server would be no different than any other server. <br><br>I think that it's the second sentence that you disagree with, but that is all there is to it. Roleplaying is a personal choice that everyone makes. If people wanting hardcore roleplay were to stick to their guns and do nothing but on any server out there, they might be able to turn peer pressure in their direction. However if they won't do it on a normal server, there's no reason to suggest that they'd do it on a server labled as a "roleplay" server. <br><br>Furthermore, any new server is going to attract a large and diverse number of people regardless of any label on the server. It would also definitely attract the people who would go there just to give the roleplayers a hard time. <br><br>I'm sorry that you don't agree, but the issue closed.

Please read the quote again: <br><br>"neither I nor other members of the tuning team actively seek out ways to make the lives of the players more difficult." <br><br>We don't sit around trying to come up with ways to make the LIVES of the players more difficult. We don't have discussions about the best way to go about upsetting the players. We address issues in game. If there's an imbalance, we'll fix it. We fix it because gameplay mechanics must be balanced in order for the game to be challenging. If it weren't challenging, no one would play. <br><br>Sure, this means that certain aspects of the game are made more difficult in nature. An encounter might become harder to overcome. A weapon that does far too much damage may be weakened. A pathing issue that allows people to slaugther without risk will be fixed. Though these things might make one particular aspect of gameplay more difficult in nature, that doesn't translate to making the LIVES of the player more difficult. <br><br>Changing an aspect of gameplay in a way that has no positive side makes the LIVES of the players difficult.

In one of the biggest Velious articles yet, DailyRadar has scored a big <a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_1402_1.html">interview with Brad McQuaid and Jeff Butler</a>.  Brad as we all know is Vice President of Verant and Jeff is the proucer of the second expansion.  It's a great read for those wanting more info on the expansion so check it out:<UL><b>DR: What sort of new monsters will EQers run into (and over and through)?</b><br><br>JB: Among the new NPC races are two breeds of Giants, the Kromrif and Kromzek, that chiefly occupy the eastern areas of Velious. The Kromrif are barbaric nomads who roam the tundra, and the mighty Kromrif have built a great citadel in the easternmost end of the largest of Veeshan's Scars. <br><br>In the mountains of the Great Divide live the Coldain, a race descended from dwarves who were shipwrecked on Velious long ago. They have been isolated for such a long period of time, they have no knowledge of the other lands and races of Norrath. <br><br> Deeper in Velious, a race of amphibious beings known as Sirens inhabit the scar filled by the Cobalt Ocean. <br><br>Players will also encounter new Dragons and their allies, including the spirits of Dragons long deceased. </UL>Thanks Solomon!

I received a new report from Jabkoraz:<BLOCKQUOTE>GM event on Druzzil Ro<br>August 30th 10PM PST<br> <br>    At about 10PM the Frontier Mountains zone was taken over several named Burynai that were slaughtering everyone in sight. When I came through I first got there, there was some role-playing going on between the Burynai and the players. They were claiming that our forces could never take them, much taunting went on. people were saying there were all at the giant fort so I headed there, along with around 20 other people, to clean them out. To our surprise they were very hard and were almost impossible to kill with such low forces. Cries for help went out to all the surrounding zones, guilds were gathered to help take the Burynai that had invaded this zone.<br><br>    When all of us had regrouped we heard that there was one wondering we headed out, to our surprise the lone Burynai Hugger was rather easy all the forces of the burynai included: Burynai Mystic, Burynai hugger, Burynai Helper, Burynai Chanter(I think), <br>Burynai  Stabber, Burynai Fighter, Burynai Burner, probably more I can't remember all the exact names. The Burynai Mystic and Fighter fell next. To everyone's surprise a barbarian named Burynai Slayer popped out and never attacked anyone. After the three fell the Burynai started to retreat no longer shouting taunts.<br><br>    After the fight everyone gathered around the Giant Fort where the Burynai Slayer said we all did quite well, said a few people (sorry guys I forgot names) were very valorous and handed them gifts, they didn't get anything though. After that he said he must go gather his forces to strike again sometime then he disappeared. None of the Burynai dropped anything except they were wielding weapons. I have no clue if they dropped the weapons or not.<br><br>    More of these were probably slain, I wasn't there for the start so I do not know how it got started.<br> <br>Jabkoraz Bloodfang</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

Items aren't supposed to all be completely useful from every standpoint. The Kunark armor that people have been finding typically has high AC and little in the way of stats, aside from a piece or two. You have to decide if the AC and the spell attached to each piece is worth giving up another piece of armor from a different place. <br><br>I would say that someone mixing and matching pieces of the high level armors is probably better off overall than the person who wears a complete set of one kind or another.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010264.html"><b>Tracking</b></a><br>We indeed have some ideas for tracking based upon the ideas presented here on the boards.

But even if we assume that what you are saying is basically true, they are losing the ability to kill an NPC named "XXX". That's basically it. <br><br>Here's the situation. The deities and dragons are meant to be top level encounters. We made an exception with Vox and Nagafen and kept them where they were even though the level cap went up. In order to do this, we had to place the level restriction on those encounters. <br><br>The same situation is present with the deities, and the solution that we have is a compromise. Vox and Nagafen remained the same yet higher level folks can't attack them, and the deities will increase in power, so the lower level folks won't be able to attack them. At the same time we are taking the loot from the current deities and moving it to NPCs that are equivalent in power to the current deities. <br><br>Leaving things as they are now is not a reasonable option.

We can't allow the duplication of items to be as simple as giving out your account info out then contacting a GM for replacement. <br><br>Had we the logs for when your stuff disappeared, we could certainly track down the recipient of your belongings and take action against them.

For part of the world, we don't even get the date right as it is :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: its unfair to a HUGE amount of players who potentially after upwards of a years play will just be approaching the level required to encounter Gods]</i></font> <br><br>I understand your feelings on this. Frankly, could it be avoided we would. From an RP perspective, across many fantasy worlds created in novels and such, the power of a deity is based upon the number or strength of their followers. That's basically what's happening in Norrath, a combination of both. <br><br>From a loot perspective, we will indeed be moving thier current loot down to creatures powered similarly to what the deities are now. The deities will be populated with level 60 loot and become an appropriate encounter for a large group in that level range. Indeed, this will raise the bar for encountering a deity, however killing deities is supposed to be the pinnacle of success in EverQuest. So is encountering dragons, however in that case we decided to place the level cap on the old dragons to keep them within reach.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010136.html"><b>AC Upgrade</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Most of the people in the following thread encouragingly enough support an AC upgrade for us.]</i></font> <br><br>The issue is that monks stack up in AC versus the other classes right where they should right now, equipped in full shiverback. Going to some of the more mundane items that have been suggested actually gives them more ac than they should have. As I mentioned before, the problem is not that shiverback's ac is too low, but the other stuff mentioned has ac that is too high, from the monk's perspective due to their innate AC bonus. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010131.html"><b>Two Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Did you say that the pop up adds were going to be removed from the page? I hope so, you are going to get me in trouble at work]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, our ad people are all over it. No popup ads are supposed to be displayed in any game forum. They're the quickest way to chase away visitors, which we certainly don't want to do. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) This is probaby considered a closed issue, but what are the chances of getting Roror super buffed and put back on Beta Neutral. I am soon going to give up on cazic all together.

If it's any solace, I don't remember purposely ignoring any of your posts :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What does it take to get a reply from Gordon??]</i></font> <br><br>Well first I have to see it. I can't really give you any pointers on getting that done. Most days I pick a page between 1 and 10, answer a bunch of posts, then just refresh the thread index on that page. I usually come to the front two pages to check and see if anything new and interesting has popped up. <br><br>Lately, I've been spending more time addressing posts that end up down on page 10 without anyone noticing them.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010130.html"><b>Getting Gloves to Proc</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If the combat system does indeed go to an equipment slot to see if your gloves are magical whenever you punch could the programmers add a few lines of code there so that whenever the combat system checks for magic status it could also do a test to see if the gloves proc an effect?]</i></font> <br><br>These are very different situations, and I'm sorry but I can't explain it much more detail. In the case you mentioned, the hand, foot, shoulder slots are not accessed upon each hit. The ability of a character to hit, kick, slam magic creatures is set for the character upon equipping or removing the item, rather than by accessing the item upon each combat round. Sometimes the way something appears to work isn't the way it works from a mechanics standpoint. It's sort of like us being unable to make potions stackable. The fact that alcohol is stackable and activatable is completely separate from the idea of making potions that are stackable and activatable. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010068.html"><b>Unannounced Change in Mountain Giants?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Well i have been camping mountin giants for a few weeks now, solo with my jboots, im a 34 wizard and it seemed at first they had a very LOW resistance to Bonds of Force and Root, well since the last patch they are resisting those spells almost every other cast and i am getting trampled, I would just like to know if i was getting extremely unlucky or it was an unnanounced change, thank you]</i></font> <br><br>To be honest, I really don't know if the changes mentioned above occurred, but it's not really something that'd I'd go check on either. We don't announce standard tweaks to NPCs, as that is part of gameplay that is subject to change at any time. I will tell you that NPC resistances versus a particular line of spells cannot be set separately, so if they are more resistant it's probably because their magic resistance was increased.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010023.html"><b>Rogues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What! Rogues don't suck. Rogues do rock! Great damage output, hide/sneak, evade is very cool, our class armor is dropped ~ not quested, our quest weapon is decent ~ not sucky... it's posts like this that keep slamming rogues back down. If you keep saying we suck, people will keep believing it. The rogue class has had many upgrades, all positive, and we are now a very effective fighting machine.

They are not the ones who are running out of content. Furthermore, since they are low level, they progress rather quickly from one set of zones to another, meaning that enjoyment of any new specifically low-level zone would be fleeting. It's the mid and upper levels that are typically most in need of new content.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006971.html"><b>Iksar Armor</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon, I must admit that I have faith that Verant will (eventually) address this issue.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for bringing the issue back up, and I can let you know that there is forward progress being made on this issue. The biggest problem that we've identified and taken steps to correct is a gap between smithed armor, and Jarsath, that is at around 20 levels wide. <br><br>I reviewed the item list for 3 sets of class-specific armor three days ago, and the quests are now being written. <br><br>As for planar type equivalents, evalutation of that end of item availability is behind the mid-level stuff in priority. One we get these quests in we'll start looking at the other end of the spectrum.</UL>

Back again at the Gameplay Board, Gordon Wrinn made even more posts on several EQ-related subjects:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010007.html"><b>Medding</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Good job with the automed idea when you open your spellbook. The only bad thing about it is taking out the /med command. Understandably, it's a convienience feature, but by any chance can that be reinstated in the game?]</i></font> <br><br>Rowyl took it out because he didn't see a need for it after implementing the auto-med feature when opening the spellbook. It's possible that we could implement it should there be a strong preference for it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Second, I have a 37 paladin. I notice when I'm medding, my head's still in the (bleeping) book. Will I ever be able to med without having the book graphic in front of me (thus seeing what's going on around me), or will the book always be there?]</i></font> <br><br>Just sit :)  At your level you do not need to look at the book to meditate. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010025.html"><b>"Gordon Mis-informed"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Not true, my most recently ignored post was on how a players pet had been hanging around in Najena for hours after the player had went LD and the pet attacked and killed me. So pets CAN and DO stay in the world after the player leaves. The GM said that this was a "game feature" and i could not receive a res..although the GM killed the "rogue" pet because he said it didn't belong there.]</i></font> <br><br>Rogue pets aren't "pets" from a game mechanics perspective. A pet is an NPC that is owned by another entity. Rogue pets aren't owned as such, and ownership can't be reapplied once it is lost.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009909.html"><b>Healing on PvP Servers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi put up a thread about a month ago that had several possibilities for code changes to fix the x-teamin and immortal healing on the Teams-PVP servers. Couldnt find the thread, so wondering if anyone knew if anything was decidied.]</i></font> <br><br>Indeed a decision was made, which I posted a week or so ago. Basically its apparent from the responses to that thread that there are many different schools of thought out there on the issue. Given that, we determined that with this case, the number of people that we'd upset with any of the suggested changes would lead to less satisfaction overall than exists currently. We've decided not to implement any changes in regard to this matter. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Verant throws alot of hollow bones at people to keep them from leaving. They think none of us notice this and that it is perfectly acceptable to do this sort of thing (along with the pitiful misdirection Abashi puts forth when answering customer complaints). I just want to say that alot of us notice this type of shyte we just don't bother to post anything on this forum ]</i></font><br><br>I'm sorry that you see it this way. I was trying to get the feelings of those who play on those servers to "test the waters" if you will.

Enchanters strength has always been in making their enviroment work for them, that includes their teammates.]</i></font> <br><br>I didn't say that it would be damaging to the game, illusioning others just isn't something that enchanters do. It's not one of the abilities of their class. When setting up these class abilities we have to form a framework of the types of things that they should and should not be able to do. Applying illusions to others is in the should-not column. It's a basic foundation for the class, and is not something that we will change. <br><br>Along the same lines as wizards not casting DOT spells, enchanters cannot apply illusions to others. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The /target command helps some but the radius of this command IS TOO SMALL]</i></font> <br><br>That's possible.

As Gestalt said, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Even given the flaws of certain components of a class (and all classes have such flaws), does it indicate a problem with the entire class? In the case of the enchanter, I'd have to say no. The enchanter is designed to be primarily a group-class, and remain one of the classes most desired by groups due to what they can do for the group. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But from what I'm hearing from TEST, shamans and enchanters are both given a pretty equal role in enchanting stuff ????]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry, but I don't want to comment on this until it enters production.</UL>

Brad made a few posts today on the official boards.

It will probably only be reasonable on a FASTER, newer d3d card (like a gforce, for example). <br><br>To test it out, just put a text file with the name <br><br>d3d_mip_enable.txt <br><br>in your everquest directory. The contents of the text file don't matter. <br><br>Let us know how it's working, with what cards, etc.<br>---<br>You know, I noticed the blipping too on my newly installed gforce 2 -- I'll ask the programmers to look into it.<br>--<br>We may add it to the patch message if it appears to work well (we'll also need to add it to the in-game interface). <br><br>This is just mostly a test and I wanted the avid message board readers and posters to be able to check it out for us.<br>---<br>Masthis: heh, that's kinda what mip mapping does -- it blurs textures in the distance to make them smoother and pattern less.

Gordon got an early start on the Gameplay Board today with the following posts he generated:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009890.html"><b>Shadow Knights Dead?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When asked what spells are useful to a group a SK can cast the response has Been NONE or one<br>Darkness??? maybe<br><br>On a poll at: <br><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/</a><br>SK&#8217;s are DEAD last!!!!]</i></font> <br><br>EverQuest has 14 classes. *Someone* had to be last. Being last here is not really indicative of any problem. Besides, the difference between SKs and some of the other bottom classes is really not that great. For instance, someone could say "SKs are preferred over monks in groups 47% of the time", and suddenly it wouldn't sound as bad. <br><br>But that poll did not ask who you want in your group, it asked what is the *FIRST* class you look for when forming a group. There's a tremendous difference between those two questions. Of course regardless of what question you ask that has people rank a list, there will still always be someone in the list who is last. <br><br>I think that SKs need to start doing what I sugggested rogues do a few months ago: Show people what you can do, educate them in the ways of an sk, but most importantly, be cool with people. Your personality and reputation has far more to do with what groups you get into than your class. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009933.html"><b>Mez Stacking</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Mez stacking is broken. Every other spell line works this way. Better spells overwrite the weaker ones.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry that you don't agree, but as I said before, mez spell stacking works as intended. NPCs only know if they are mez'd or not, and the spell effect is absolute regardless of the duration of the spell. I've spread the word around that this is indeed not a bug, so you shouldn't get conflicting information going forward.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009938.html"><b>Velicous Creatures</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: PLEASE tell me its not a rehash of exsisting MOBS / Monsters with pretty new colors.]</i></font> <br><br>There will of course be some new variaties of existing creatures, as there is in Kunark, but there will also be a bunch of new ones as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: P.S. Will this new graphics engine revamp ALL of Everquest or just the new areas in SoV]</i></font> <br><br>As with Kunark, the new areas will adopt newer and more advanced technology. "EverQuest Proper", however, has to remain as it was in the original release.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009940.html"><b>Dragons</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are we told that the three dragons for the high level are now rare spawns? Why are we facing more hardship the higher the lvls we get? I really think that this change is rediculous and should have been annouced before you waisted alot of people time.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm afraid that I don't understand your complaint. NPC spawn rates/times etc., are never broadcast to the players. Secondly, I'm not sure what you mean by "waisted a lot of people's time". If you mean that people were waiting in the zone when the servers came up to get the dragons, and they weren't there, that doesn't really equate to much lost time at all. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009953.html"><b>Mana Battery</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon, about this quote:<br><br>"I'm sorry, but we've ruled out creating "mana batteries". The greatest extent that we can implement a mana battery is done with..." <br><br>Why, then, do you continue to leave bards broken, serving nothing more than this purpose? Its what we've been complaining about for ages.]</i></font> <br><br>I don't understand what you are getting at here, if you could elaborate. The subject of allowing enchanters to create mana batteries, and the existing modulation rod and the necromancer "conversion" line are not, in my opinion, related to bards. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009963.html"><b>What would you do if you caught someone cheating?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The GM could not verify that this item was in the players posession and gave that player the benefit of doubt and reimbursed the item. I was immediately told this occurance by the player. They bragged how they got over on the gm.]</i></font> <br><br>We'd certainly appreciate you /reporting such things if witnessed. Our new customer service policies regarding reimbursement is based on our ability to determine things from the logs, but you are correct that we will give the benefit of the doubt lacking any concrete evidence to the contrary. <br><br>However, if this is abused everyone is aware of the impact upon the game it will have, which is why we ban any scammers immediately.</UL>

Yakatizma hit the new <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Coalition+of+Tradesfolk&number=8">Coalition of Tradesfolk Board</a> recently and has made several posts to date:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000076.html"><b>Recipes</b></a><br>The recipes themselves are indeed the simplest part of the process. It is the many factors that play into balance and any extra coding that needs to be done that is the most time consuming. Once the properties, economic values, availability and difficulty of the product and its components plus the impact of the final product on existing items are determined the recipe table can be produced and placed for testing. This is why some content with very low balancing issues can be implemented quickly and others, blacksmithing for example, with high balance issues are very time consuming. For instance, the silk thread, bandages, small bag, and silk cord, all of which had extremely minimal balance issues were placed on test server the same day I saw them on the wishlist, but of course for them to appear on the live servers they must go through testing and wait for an available patch.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000066.html"><b>Chemistry</b></a><br>There is one other class that dabbles in a chemistry of sorts that can mix dyes besides Shaman.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000047.html"><b>Trade Skill Messages</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Implement a new message for tradeskills with the same display range as /say.<br>For example, if successful: "A sparkle of light gleams from Laestir's jewelry kit."<br>Alternately, if unsuccessful: "Laestir empties his jewelry kit of ruined materials."]</i></font><br><br>This is a very desirable feature in my opinion. I will attempt to have it addressed at the next tuning meeting.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000036.html"><b>Fletching</b></a><br>I'll come up with an arrow recipe that uses ****atrice beaks but the benefit of the arrow will have to be in its damage/delay ratio and its magic/non magic flag. Unfortunately the current engine does not allow for missiles to have procs. Another problem would be the fact that items with spell effects can not be made stackable, making storage and reloading of missiles with effects difficult.<br>--<br>If there are other items that you feel would make sense as fletching components in addition to the c-ockatrice beak I would like to see a list of them posted.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000014.html"><b>Tailoring</b></a><br>Thank you for the feedback. I have changed the icon for silk threads to the "urticating hairs" graphic, changed the weight of Silk Bandages to 0.2 and removed the skill check from creating Silk Thread.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000105.html"><b>Enchanters</b></a><br>Fear not enchanters. The summon mana series of spells has been expanded for use in enchanted trade skill items and you may find that enchanted precious metals have uses outside of jewelry craft. It is true that some items with special properties may need a cleric or shaman in addition to an enchanter, and in the case of some cultural items from societies without casters may exclude the enchanter entirely. However, the magic items produced with the assistance of a Cleric or Shaman are very noticeably different than those produced with solely enchanters. Enchanters will remain true to their namesake as masters of enchantments.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000013.html"><b>Tinkering</b></a><br>For tinkering to produce the mechanical wonders and blunders that gnomes are famous for it must be fairly heavily reliant on products of other trade skills as well as odds and ends found by the gnome as he adventures. The plus side of the dependency on other trade skills and treasure drops is that the difficulty to create a tinkered item will allow for more beneficial and/or powerful end products. Once the blacksmithing goes live I will be continuing to add content to the trade skills, including tinkering as I work on Velious. If any of you tinkers have good ideas that you would like to see implemented for the trade skill please post them on this board, ideally with the prefix Wish :(  title of post)there were some good suggestions for several trade skills on the wishlist board and now that this board is back up hopefully there will be many more.</UL>On a sidenote, you may have noticed I have started putting two spaces inbetween posts on the infobits.  If you like it double-spaced or single-spaced please leave a comment indicating it.

We've hired a number of new tech-support and customer-service representatives, it's likely that one of them had a problem with the phone system. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So I try that -- Am I surprised when I get the same message trying to log in? NO! But guess what? I have to CALL BACK. Yes, another test of paitence. So I figure lets email, its easier and easier to get a response. Well, amazed.

I do indeed apologize for the problems.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009674.html"><b>Colors, Colors Everywhere</b></a><br>Per today's patch, the client will write the original colors as defaults when creating the file.

The following report was sent in by Ganzon:<BLOCKQUOTE>This occured at 8/29/00, around 2AM EST. <br><br>-GM Event on Povar-<br><br>While hunting Sand Giants in Oasis, I came across two <br>named Sand Giants standing near the orc highway. They didn't attack onsight, <br>and just stood there for a few minutes. Reports that other named Sand Giants <br>appeared at the docks were confirmed, and after a moment Harziz Garnt, a <br>midget Sand Giant (about the size of a human) began to kill at the docks. <br><br>He had  a partner who was about the size of a gnome casting wizard spells. <br>Reports of his brethren on a killing spree at the Orc Highway were also <br>confirmed, and that was when we got smart and decided to retreat to the first <br>pillar at the water to regroup. The Giants were killing off everyone, <br>disregarding race and religion...they had to be stopped. We formed assault <br>groups and hunted down Harziz Garnt, who, when attacked, called for his <br>gnome-sized friend to cast a devestating area of effect-rain spell in the <br>dead center of our mass of about 30 people. My party dove out of the assault <br>group in time to avoid being hit by the second and third rains, but most were <br>not that lucky. <br><br>We regrouped again at the first pillar and buffed up while <br>the Giants were enjoying themselves by killing weaker people. After everyone <br>was at full mana and full health, we went after Harziz again who had taken <br>the gypsies hostage with his gnome-sized friend. We pulled him away from the <br>gypsies and proceeded to beat him down, Fearing his friend so that we <br>wouldn't be hit with anymore devestating area spells. After a few minutes of <br>nuking and melee, we got him on the run, and eventually killed him. We had <br>very little time to celebrate because the other assault group was being <br>wrecked by the gnome Giant. He went down fairly easy though, once we got <br>enough melee people in there to interrupt his castings. The third giant to <br>die was one of the large ones, Nirziz Pire, who ran faster than a Shaman with <br>Spirit of Cheetah. <br><br>I myself didn't get to see the fourth one go down, or even <br>if he did, but I remember hearing his shout about how we "won the sands this <br>day." <br><br>/OOC As far as I know no one was able to loot anything, and none of the <br>Giants were part of a GM quest. This was all a big fun thing, and no one lost <br>exp for dying at the hands of the Giants.  <br><br>Ganzon Actueras,<br>35th Shaman of The Sentinals.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you.

Gordon Wrinn, aka Abashi (aka Top Secret Goverment Message Board Posting Machine), let loose another round of board posts on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop: <UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009659.html"><b>Thicken Mana Line</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why not make the mana vials expendable items that recover a certain amount of mana when consumed? The higher up the mana vial spell is, the more mana is regained by drinking the vial. You can keep down the abuse of this item by making it so they cannot be placed in any containers. That and the high level ones will be VERY expensive to make (4 rubies for the highest level mana vial).]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry, but we've ruled out creating "mana batteries". The greatest extent that we can implement a mana battery is done with the modulation rod (which eats hitpoints and is lore) and with your friendly neighborhood necromancer.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009672.html"><b>Smokers Getting Damaged While Taking Breaks</b></a><br>You could just turn your autoattack function on and back up against a zone wall. Anything coming after you would then most likely be in front of you, be auto-targeted, and attacked when it approached. The best suggestion I can offer is of course that you camp to take your breaks. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009656.html"><b>Disillusioned Enchanters</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are enchanters not given the ability to cast these very same race/creature illusions upon either the group as a whole, or individuals in a group? (You already HAVE the code for specific-case faction issues with the already in- game illusion series of spells)]</i></font> <br><br>I agree that the code exists, is in game, and would be easy to do. Our reasons for not implementing illusions on others via enchanters is that its not what we had in mind for them. It's part of the premise for the enchanter class. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Are you explicitly saying that in order for an enchanter to cast any illusion spell on themselves/others that a faction adjustment MUST take place and that for this reason, Verant would not attempt to try to code a spell allowing an illusion change to any NPC model in a particular zone? Or would Verant consider allowing enchanters to create illusions with no faction adjustments?]</i></font> <br><br>Illusions always have faction adjustments. They adjust the "race" portion of the faction formula. The game/faction engine does not allow someone to appear as a different race without adopting the faction settings for that race. As such, special allowances have been made for every race that can be illusioned. Opening more races to this would require a massive revamp of the faction engine and how it interacts with illusions. That revamp would constitute a major change to what defines EverQuest. Furthermore, the diversity the various areas in the game would surely lead to some bugs that would be implemented in the course of the revamp. Given these reasons, a change along these lines does not have benefits that outweigh cost. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Aside from faction issues, are you saying that by essentially allowing the 'minor illusion' spell to also include NPC models, in addition to the myriad of other object models in a particular zone, that this creates some sort of a problem? If so, could you please elaborate?]</i></font> <br><br>I think that I covered this one above. If I need to elaborate further, please let me know. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009655.html"><b>Harmony Upgrade</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Level 24 would be perfect for a harmony upgrade that could be castable indoors. I think this would greatly increase numbers in mid level dungeons, were crowed control is needed most.]</i></font> <br><br>Harmony is too powerful to extend to the indoors. We'd have to make it resistable and give a chance for the whole group of targets to come running in order to balance it.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009648.html"><b>More Hybrid Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi you said that hybrids spells are largely useless in a well balanced group <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009260.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009260.html</a>  ]</i></font><br><br>I just reread my post to that thread, and I believe that I indicated that the spells aren't useless even when in a group where the parnet class is present. I certainly didn't say that "hybrids spells are largely useless in a well-balanced group".<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009647.html"><b>Rowl's Day Off: Bug Found!</b></a><br>Oops :)<br><br>Rowyl's off for a couple of days but I'll mention it to him when he gets back. I'd agree that that is pretty useless until we get the change made. Unless if course if you want to type the emote out every time. Sorry about that.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009638.html"><b>Control Item Farming</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I will use the FBSS(flowing black silk sash) for my example. Consider if that only ONE FBSS can be looted by each player on a server. Each account allows 8 players per server. That means you could only loot 8 FBSS's per account, then you would have to purchase any others you might want(for whatever reason) from other players.]</i></font> <br><br>This is much like the "Lore for Life" suggestion that was posed here several months ago, suggesting that once an item was in a characters possession, that they could not get another one, whether it be via drop, or trade, or possibly a combination of one or another. It's an idea that I like, however not something that's compatible with EverQuest's core mechanics. It might however be applicable to future products.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009643.html"><b>Can you riposte a riposte? </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This can be fun in an arena environment between two melee classes who use their 100% riposite chance disciplines at the same time.]</i></font> <br><br>Yeah, I was so worried about that little feature when it first came out I grabbed a tester and had it tested right there for fear it would crash the server :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009635.html"><b>Velious Questions </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Velious Questions <br><br>Your questions really aren't related to Velious, but are more along the lines of general gameplay questions.]</i></font> <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Will playes every be able to pick the handiness of their character? i.e. Left handed players<br>2) Will anything be done to make Ogres look less goofy? A way to turn<br>the butt scraching off would help, I think the best way would be a long grey beard, but somthing needs to be done ]</i></font><br><br>We have no plans along these lines at present. Character geometry, animations, and the combat system are considered complete and as such are unlikely to change going forward. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) Will players be able to customize thier clothing? i.e. Dyes, or maybe an option for what clothing will show up and what doesn't, like<br>the goofy looking bronze helm for Ogres ]</i></font><br><br>To a certain extent, something along one of the lines you've suggested is planned for the future. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) not related to Velious, but Next time there is an expantion that includes a new race, PLEASE take a poll on what new race you guys will make. Everyone I've talked to likes this Idea. ]</i></font><br><br>It is very unlikely that new player races will be forthcoming in EverQuest.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009634.html"><b>Overlapping Mezes?</b></a><br>The stacking of mez spells works as intended. They are not designed so that more powerful mez's overwrite weaker ones.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009628.html"><b>The Rathe In Distress</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:From a player's perspective, a multiple Hate or Fear zone system would be just fantastic. A player would just select PlaneFearA or PlaneFearB and so forth when trying to zone in. This would not ruin the economy as the items are already no drop nor would it throw the armor rate off balance as it already has been off balance negatively for months. Bottom line - no matter how you implement it, either the plane armor drop rate has to increase - or the number of places where you can get it has to increase. Either duplicate Fear and Hate, implement new planes or increase drop rate.]</i></font> <br><br>We've addressed the "multiple copy" proposals before. In short, this is not something that we would implement. It would indeed mess up the economy, create unmanagable server load, and be inconsistant with our ideals for the world. There are more than enough areas in the game to support everyone who wishes to adventure at every level, and we're about to add an entire new continent. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:The guilds on the Rathe server favor a reservation system]</i></font> <br><br>That aside, I have to put my "reservation system disclaimer" in now. We do not support nor endorse, nor will we enforce any type of "reservation system" in use on the servers for the purpose of scheduling dragons, planes, other zones, or other encounters. Compliance with them is entirely voluntary on the part of the groups involved.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008951-5.html"><b>Saviente Fired?</b></a><br>I aplogize for the insensitive smiley on the end of Chris's post. He signs all of his posts in that matter and I've asked him to be a little more careful with it in the future. <br><br>To elaborate, privacy laws and professional policy prohibit us from discussing the issue in the detail that is being requested in this thread. It's not a matter of "corporate doublespeak" as a few have suggested in this thread, its that we cannot expose ourselves to discussing someone's personal life in public without their consent. <br><br>I appreciate all of the support that has been shown in the thread, as it's always nice to hear when our customer service representatives liked by our customers, but that is the extent to which I can address the issue. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009625.html"><b>Was Strength of Earth Modified?</b></a><br>No spells were modified as a result of this patch. And no, the changes to the "Sense" series really don't qualify as spell changes (meaning a change to the spell database). <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009619.html"><b>"Are you ever going to fix Archery?"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Yea, like this will ever get a response.]</i></font> <br><br>If you'd like to repost this, sans insults, you'd have a better chance. I was reading your post, and getting a reply ready when I reach the insulting section of the original post followed by this one, and decided against responding. Normally I don't even comment to this extent on such a thread, but I thought I'd pop in and let you know why posts of this nature are unlikely to "ever get a response". <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009179.html"><b>Suggestions to Improve EQ</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. GM Events-<br><br>I posted a snip about this on the topic of the week thread, but thought I would bring it up here. Just to remind you to look back there]</i></font> <br><br>The discussion of the week thread deals with broad issues from more of a philosophical standpoint rather than individual ideas. There's about 450 responses to those threads, which I of course won't comment on them all. If you had some specific ideas you might want to post them outside of the thread. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Gods-<br><br>I think Gods should be increased in difficulty. An absurd request eh? Lemme explain. These are the Gods, plain and simple they should be the hardest in the game. But of course the reward would be the "best" in the game I know it sounds odd, but hey it's just a suggestion. ]</i></font><br><br>We do indeed have plans to do this in the near future. The current loot from the deities will be moved to other encounters of a similar current difficulty, and the deities themselves will get much tougher and gain new loot. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Someone kills Karana, It doesn't rain for a month in game. Something along those lines. I see Gods as big and all mighty. If you kill one of em stuff is gonna go down! Once again, just a suggestion. ]</i></font><br><br>Ahhh, I see where you are going now, you just want it to stop raining in the Karanas :) :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Trade Skills<br><br>I think everyone can agree these need to be redone big time. ]</i></font><br><br>In progress. Check out the tradeskill board. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. Towns-<br><br>Now all these revamping to dungeons, but I was thinking, what about revamping a town or 2? I think this would be great! Everquest is an always expanding game right? A new look on an old town would be awesome. ]</i></font><br><br>While we can make changes to NPCs in town, and the things they do, we're restricted from making world-geometry or texture changes due to download size in most cases. We'll certainly keep the ideas in mind though. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. Random Spawns in Outdoor areas<br><br>This is always fun. I love being in a huge zone and someone saying "Who is Joe Blow?!" And everyone says I dunno never heard of em. "What's the loc?" I really like the sense that you don't know if you're gonna find some really kewl monster just running around in the middle of no where.]</i></font> <br><br>I agree that this is fun. Of course there can be too much of a good thing. These encounters remain special since they are rare in nature. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6. Meditate book<br><br>Now this probably has been suggested before, but I'll give it a shot. How about when someone sits down to meditate, it shows them looking at a book. I mean, the book graphic is there right?]</i></font> <br><br>Cool idea! :)</UL>

Big day on the boards so far for Verant's Gordon Wrinn.  Here's what he's posted today so far on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009258.html"><b>Enchanter Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Will Enchanters ever get the ability to Illusion others? I know this MAY raise some faction issues, but then again so do the Druids wolf illusions. Anyhow, At higher levels, Illusion other: (insertrace here) would make up for the lack of illuions ant the higher levels. After all Enchanters are the "Master of Illusions" heck, we even get called illusionists at high levels. Please let me know what u think of this idea. I am rather curious]</i></font> <br><br>There have been several posts as of late concerning other illusions. One limitation is that certain models are only available in certain zones, where other models are available globally. Illusions are for the most part restricted to zones in which the model exists. It has been suggested that we should allow enchanters to illusion to the "nearest animate entity" in the zone, however that would indeed present faction issues. <br><br>Each illusion requires specific case-coding to handle the faction issues associated with each illusion. The number of different NPC body-types in the game would make that difficult, and in many cases impossible.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009254.html"><b>/guildmessage Suggestion</b></a><br>Hey there, just dropping a note to let you know that we've seen this request *many* times here on the boards. It's something that we may be able to do at some point, but we really can't promise it as a coming feature.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009260.html"><b>Rangers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. Spells givenn to Rangers are useless in groups and outside of groups do not allow Soloing exp giving mobs.]</i></font> <br><br>Out of your four points, I'd agree with all but #4. The spells aren't useless, and are only eclipsed when fighting in a group where there is a druid. Even then, the rangers mana can be used to do things like buff pets and help out between fights, so they aren't total invalidated. <br><br>Also, as I've mentioned before, the soloability argument isn't indicative of any problem, as the class is not designed to solo. Finally, your other three points simply state the design, and are also not indicative of any problems. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Archery is a Joke.]</i></font> <br><br>I disagree, especially after the double-damage upgrade above level 50. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And yes we do less damage Dual Yielding than Warriors.]</i></font> <br><br>There are many weapons out there that can be used by both warriors and rangers. Ranger damage output is within a percentage point or two of a warrior wielding a weapon of the same quality. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Do a who all Ranger 50-60 on Cazic thule with 2800 people on line and you will see 20-25 and who all Ranger 40 50 you see 20 more any day of the week. This should be telling you something.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, people didn't start complaining about drops in ranger numbers until the "rangers suck" drive started shortly after Kunark was released. It is, in my opinion, the same thing that happened in regards to rogues complaining on the boards about how bad they were. I think that the community is starting to realize how valuable rogues are at this point, so the numbers will start rising again. <br><br>Rangers might have a bit more of a difficult time ahead of them, as recovering from a "we suck" drive is very difficult. Remember that when a bunch of people get on the board and complain about how bad they feel their class is, other people read those posts and begin to believe that it's true. It's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009267-2.html"><b>Ralls and PvP Issues</b></a><br>The GM probably shouldn't have stated it in such absolute terms, but no, there are no plans to implement a move at present. That however does not equate to "There will be no move". <br><br>The quotes posted by Nanuvis-RZ on the first page of this thread still apply. And I do apologize, but this is not an issue that I'll be able to give periodic updates on, as we've been shifting priorities a bit here. <br><br>The PvP servers are still primarily PvE, like all of the other servers. PvP is there as an addition to the environment. As such, if we have to decide between changes that will improve things across all servers, or only on the PvP servers, we'll have to go with the one across all servers first. <br><br>My recommendation would be that if you absolutly cannot stand playing on Rallos any longer, you should create a character on one of the other servers and play there. As long as the population on Rallos continues to be strong, we're not going to assign priority to drastically changing the server environment. I'm not trying to be short or gruff, but we are going to need some type of sign that drastic changes are indeed wanted on that server beyond what's on these boards to provide us with a business reason to assign it some priority.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009261.html"><b>Crashing Bug</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone else having problems with the game crashing to their desktop from the character select screen? the first time it happened was when i tried zoning into WC,then i crashed,then i tried to enter norrath then it crashed again. Anyone else having this problem ?]</i></font> <br><br>There was a crash bug fixed in this patch that would cause people who had exited the game to crash upon trying to come back in, but that bug shouldn't have caused you to crash out of the game itself. We also included a bunch of code-optimizations in today's patch, so that might help out with some of the random crashes we've heard of.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009280.html"><b>Blacksmithing Question</b></a><br>I have a note in to the designer responsible for tradeskills to find out if this is an oversight or by design. I hope to have word back later today or tomorrow. You might also consider posting about this on the tradeskills board, which that designer will visit regularly.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009284.html"><b>Way to Stop Camping</b></a><br>This was suggested before under the moniker "Lore for Life". It's a nice idea that I like as a feature, but unfortunately not likely to be compatible with EQ at any point. It's one of those things that needs to be designed as a core foundation of the game in the begining.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009304.html"><b>EQ Slang Not Understood By All</b></a><br>I apologize for that. I usually try to define any abbreviation that I use at least once within my response if it isn't already defined by the poster. Sometimes I forget a couple :)<br><br>I have the same problem with some of the posts I read. I've had to go asking around the office just to see if someone knows that a particular abbreviation is. <br><br>By the way, what is a BMT?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009311.html"><b>No Drop = Soulbound?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I guess this isn't really a question, but rather a suggestion. Could you just make it so that a no drop item is soulbound in the way that Sebilis/Charisis/VP keys are?]</i></font> <br><br>We "soulbound" the keys so you wouldn't have to do the quest to get the key twice just for the purpose of going back and getting your body. Making all nodrop items soulbound is another matter entirely, and not related to the initial change. We did this as a matter of courtesy and to help players out. There was no balance issue or gameplay design that necessitated completing the key-quest twice. <br><br>Though we certainly won't make all nodrop items soulbound, we do indeed now have a way to add additional value items that are awarded. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009253.html"><b>Why do Hybrids have an EXP penalty?</b></a><br>This subject is fairly well covered in the FAQ at http:/everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009558.html"><b>Venril Sathir Faction</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just want to know if there will ever be a valid story line in the game to explain why I can't group with my friends in the dungeons in kunark which hit venril sathir faction.]</i></font> <br><br>I believe that the zones have been in long enough now that someone can reasonably extrapolate the story line involved. I'll give a hint to enable you to do some further research: <br><br>Who runs Karnor's, Charasis, and Kaesora?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009249.html"><b>Leveling</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon, if you wish to respond to this, respond with 'Actually Azrael178, there are tons of stuff that have yet to be figured out, even at your level.' I mean, only say that if it is true, but give me some clue as to how close I was when I said most everthing in game (save Planar/Veeshans Peak) has been solved.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually Azrael178, "Actually" is one of my favorite words (next to "evidently") :)<br><br>Seriously though, thanks for the post and I understand where you are coming from. It would be fair to say that most things in game have been solved by one person or another, which is why we keep putting new things in. It's certainly difficult if not impossible to put content in at a rate higher than it can be consumed. For instance, it takes an author months to write a book, while it takes only a few hours to read one. The guys here, for instance, have been working for weeks on putting together some really special quests for all of the classes. I think that it will only be a couple of weeks before they have all been solved by someone. <br><br>I think that the important thing here is that though things might have been solved by someone, they haven't been solved by you, yet. There is still tons of content out there for you to explore, and we put more in nearly every week. I think that we can entertain you for sometime to come :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009595.html"><b>Adding Target's Name to Socials</b></a><br>We do indeed plan on adding the "@" to the chat channels as well as emotes in the near future. I've also asked Rowyl to include additional identifiers for gender-specific subjective (he, she, it), objective (him, her, it), and possesive (his, her, its) pronouns.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009244.html"><b>The Unknown Pet Command</b></a><br>In beta, "/pet attack" would not automatically assume the target, so you had to enter the name, or get hit first to initiate the attack. At that time I created a macro of "/pet attack a". That handled most encounters fairly well :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009617.html"><b>Have NPC Pets Die With Master</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Makes sense. Happens to PCs. Why not NPCs too?]</i></font> <br><br>See the FAQ. NPCs can do things that PCs cannot.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009236.html"><b>More on Discussion of the Week</b></a><br>When the first thread was closed due to size, I started another at: <br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009074.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009074.html</a><br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009624.html"><b>Idea Suggestion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:We have wizards, that get some natural immunity to resistences. And we have spells that lower resist, and items that raise resist. So why no items that give you a bonus to cut through a mobs resist? Like most resist items, they are in of themselves not always the best item to wear durning normal day to day play. But there are times when you put them on for special occasions. An example would be fire resist items for a Naggy raid.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not sure I understand the question. <br><br>There are spells in the game that lower the resists of the target. There are items in game that increase your resists. There are items in game that proc spells that reduce the resistances of the target, and wizards innately roll versus lower resist-scores by the target once above level 35. <br><br>Are you asking for an item that YOU wear, that decreases the ability of the target to resist? If so, we do not have the ability to flag specific items with the ability to reduce the resist rate of a target without going through a spell effect. Furthermore, there are sufficient methods available to reduce resist scores on a target, so the suggested change really isn't something that is needed in game, and as such would be low priority if we ever did decide to move in this direction.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008466.html"><b>Sound Fix</b></a><br>To my knowledge, all known sound-related crash bugs were fixed a while ago. We are indeed working on a new sound engine to improve the way sounds are handled in EverQuest and improve the use of EAX though. <br><br>I do keep hearing enough anecdotal evidence concerning sound-related crashes to indicate that they still might be happening. What kind of card are you using? I have an SBLive in both my work and home PCs, and never crash with them. People having crashes usually say that they have an SBLive as well. If so, do you have all of the latest drivers? <br><br>Finally, if you disable your sound card in the device manager, do the crashes go away. Obviously I'm not suggesting that this is a "fix" for any sound related issue, but it is the final test to determine whether a crashing problem is sound-related.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009021-2.html"><b>The /Petition System</b></a><br>I've personally petitioned many times while in my player character to report names or profanity, however I've never petitioned for some issue requiring "help" within game. <br><br>This fairly well represents the average player in game. There are on the other hand players who petition quite frequently for help of one kind or another. Sometimes it's due to a run of bad luck or perhaps system-related issues. <br><br>At some point, I'd like to see us start tracking petitions made within the last month or so and using that data to establish priorities for helping the customers. Chances are that if someone hasn't petitioned in the last month, and he or she is petitioning now, they need help right away.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008941.html"><b>GMs as NPCs?</b></a><br>Uluhtc, <br><br>Did you lose experience when you died? If so, it was an NPC. If not, it was an actor. <br><br>In any case, I'm not at all familiar with this incident and I'll look into it tomorrow. I imagine that there is more story to what was going on than you may have been privy to at your particular point of interaction. <br><br>There are many different types of dynamic events that take place in game. Not all of them have to do with killing, though that does play a role of one kind or another in many of them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:If the GM had picked up the pieces]</i></font> <br><br>The important thing to remember is that an NPC being played by a human is not a GM. They are an NPC in the world, and just happen to have a human brain behind them. They act in the world as an NPC and react to stimuli based upon a script and character profile. <br><br>Knowing how these things work, I'd say that there was probably something more to what was going on. If you see something of this nature in the future you might try to talk to the NPC to see what they are there for.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008284.html"><b>Smithing and Tinkering</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why is blacksmithing getting revamped BEFORE tinkering?????]</i></font> <br><br>Blacksmithing is a skill that can be used by everyone. Tinkering is a skill that can only be used by gnomes. It makes more sense to work on blacksmithy first. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: STICK TO YOUR PROMISES. You said tinkering was next, now own up to your words.]</i></font> <br><br>I do not believe that I said this. I do recall saying that several of the tradeskills are being revamped, but did not put them in any specific order. Please be patient. Everyone wants to see their issue addressed next. We'll get to all that we have planned as we are able.</UL>

Interesting news from the infamous pages of <a href="http://slashdot.org/yro/00/08/30/1652232.shtml">Slashdot.org</a> to bring you this afternoon.  It appears that after all these months a server emulator has finally been released.  Here's the report:<UL>Zummi writes "The people at <a href="http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch">HackersQuest</a> have released a beta of their Everquest server emulator. " Verant's  reaction should be interesting to watch - EthernalQuest looks cool, and will hopefully look better than the 1992 graphics of Everquest. </UL>An interesting thing to note is the fact that HackersQuest has been around for a long time and Verant has not as of yet shut them down.  Certainly questions come to mind regarding conflicts this has with the EULA, but on the other side Verant has done little to enforce their rules against auctioning <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&ht=1&SortProperty=MetaEndSort&query=EverQuest">accounts and items on eBay</a>.  <br><br>To discuss this issue more I have created a <b><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=6654186&start=6654186#6654186">special discussion thread</b></a> on our General Board where you can share and comment on this issue with the people of this community.<br><br>We'll bring you updates to this story as they occur.<br><br><s><b>Update:</b> Something else I thought I should note here is that HackersQuest is apparently is based in China. </s><br><br><b>Update:</b> Whoops, scratch that.

Here's a copy of the entire message:<UL>August 30th, 8:00am<br>------------------------<br><br>*Today's Patch*<br><br>Today we modified the EverQuest client to implement the following changes:<br><br>- Corrected a bug that would cause players to crash if they entered the<br>game, exited to the server selection screen, and tried to reenter the game.<br>- Corrected a bug that caused delays when switching between UI modes due to<br>the text wrapping change implemented last week.<br>- The /book command (/book #) now accepts pages 1 through 50, and will<br>switch to the proper page.<br>- Opening your spellbook will automatically cause you to begin meditating<br>providing that you have the skill.<br>- Removed the /meditate command since it is no longer necessary.<br>- You can now activate a hotkey while the spellbook is open by pressing the<br>corresponding number-key.<br>- The "/target [name]" command can be used to target other players by name.<br>Please note that this ability is subject to the range to the target.<br>- EverQuest will now write the original default colors when creating the<br>EQCLIENT.INI file, rather than the new colors that were put in a few weeks<br>ago.<br>- The @-character can be used in emotes to indicate a target.  For instance,<br>if you target "a gnoll" and type "/emote laughs cruelly at @", the output<br>will be, "Playername laughs cruelly at a gnoll".<br>- People with the /LFG (Looking for Group) flag set will now have their<br>over-head name prefixed with an asterisk.  Remember that you can search for<br>people looking for a group by using the "/who" and "/who all" commands.<br>Typing "/who all ranger 40 50 lfg" will return a list of all rangers between<br>40 and 50 that are looking for a group.<br>- The "Sense" series (Undead, Animal, and Summoned) will no longer point you<br>towards people's pets.<br><br>*Note on Voice Recognition*<br><br>Last week we implemented voice recognition technology in EverQuest.  To use<br>this new feature, please refer to the EQROKManualSupplement.doc file in your<br>EverQuest directory.  Please note that you must already have a voice<br>recognition engine that is compliant with the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI),<br>version 4.0.  The voice recognition technology was tested with Dragon<br>NaturallySpeaking(r) v4.0.  Check with the developer of your software to<br>find out if it is SAPI 4.0 compliant.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Arkinia!
