Brad wrote a follow-up to his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013030.html">Veeshan's Peak loot post</a>.  Here's the entire message:<UL><i>The following was my third post regarding the subject prior to the thread corrupting (*sigh*):<br><br>I don't mean this in a condescending way at all, but I honestly wish some of you would at least try to put yourselves in our shoes.<br><br>What options do we have in these situations?<br><br>First, let's establish a few facts: <br><br>1. This is a dynamic game. It may not be as dynamic as some would like with massive invasions and huge volcanic eruptions and entire NPC governments taking action that affect players' lives, but it DOES change. We add to the game, we change the game, and some times we take away. (Actually, it makes me worry for when the technology is such that we can do all of that stuff -- how will people respond... 'That volcano created a mountain where my favorite hunting grounds were and blocked the entrance to my favorite dungeon and now I have to walk farther to the new entrance at the top of the crater! You nerfed me!'). <br><br>We cannot have stagnant games, yet when the status quo changes, SOMEBODY always get's upset, especially if the change is not universally positive (and what change is?).<br><br>2. We're not perfect! We will make mistakes. We will continue to make mistakes as long as we continue to add content, and things will be out of balance in the future.<br><br>3. We learn and get better. For example, lots of universal class non-specific loot like Rubicite is bad. <br><br>So, what options do we have:<br><br>1. We could just leave mistakes and aspects of the game that didn't turn out as planned. I think that leads to stagnation. I also think it leaves areas of the game untouched... empty zones, ignored quests, etc.<br><br>2. We could upgrade the VP items that are weaker to what they should be. This doesn't address the other items that are too powerful relative to their difficulty to obtain, but it would address one side of the problem. The problem is that they'd be comparable then most likely to the other broken items. Many players would then simply try to obtain the broken items since they are as good as the upgraded VP items but easier to get. And we'd still have broken items.<br><br>3. We could upgrade the VP items and make them better than the non-VP broken items (and not adjust encounter difficulty). Here's where the MUDflation comes in. Now, what have we done to all the other items in the game... they're all indirectly weaker now. And, we've set a new (lower) standard of risk vs. reward. The game becomes less challenging, etc. <br><br>4. We could upgrade the VP items and make them better than the non-VP broken items (and then re-adjust NPC encounter difficulty throughout the game as well as other treasure tables everywhere, raising the entire risk/reward ratio but keeping it balanced). This, by the way, is what the infamous mud wimping article would have us do -- either that, or nothing. Basically, it's a ton of work and would probably introduce a whole slew of new problems and potential for mistakes. Bluntly, we'd rather allocate those resources elsewhere.<br><br>So, our solution is to identify the non-VP items that are out there that are too powerful and probably move them to VP. And then take some underpowered VP items and move them elsewhere AND/OR make some new items to replace the over-powered ones.<br><br>I also want to emphasize that there really aren't that many items. Also, just to let you know, MORE of this is going to occur when EQ Live starts revamping old world zones (Permafrost, Najena, etc.) We will be adding new content AND moving existing content around.<br><br>I know this isn't compatible with some players' feelings that how and where things are in the game the day they started playing MUST also be the same 3, 6 or 12 months later. But, with all due respect, that's simply NOT how MMORPGs work. As mentioned earlier, if anything, MMORPGs will become MORE dynamic and less predictable/dependable in the future.<br><br>In closing, I'll quote from one of the EQ Live game designers emails to me regarding some of the items that very well might change -- I want to emphasize again that there aren't that many we're talking about:<br><br>"Broken Weapons include: Blade of the Black Dragon Eye, Warding Star, Runed Fighters Staff (Somewhat easy to acquire, godly proc ratio), Moss Covered Twig (we all know this one), etc.<br><br>Those are a few examples of broken items which have been acquired by players and severely hamper our attempts to create new and interesting loot. The players should be made happy soon however. We just went through and nerfed the drops of those broken weapons and "added new content" -- replacement new items. Near copies of some of the broken weapons are being placed into VP." -EQ Live Game Designer<br><br>-Brad<br><br>p.s. I know this might encourage people to camp more short-term, but I wanted to be up front and detailed with all of you nonetheless. Heh, everything's a trade-off.</I></UL>

I just received the following announcement from Verant's Cindy Archuleta:<UL><I>Greetings!<br><br>You might want to note that there have been two important announcements<br>added to the Sony EQ Board. Both are Real Life Events that are designed for<br>the players. <br><br>First, on November 4-5, players are invited to attend the Velious Launch<br>Party in Las Vegas! They can meet other players, the Velious Development<br>Team and have a chance to play on the new Velious continent before it is<br>released! They can also win great prizes, including signed copies of the<br>expansion pack (to be shipped when it is shipped to the retailers).<br><br>Also announced is the next Real Life event I will be coordinating. The EQ<br>Fan Faire will be held in February in a yet to be determined East Coast<br>city. Check out the site to cast your vote for our destination! <br><br>Visit <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/">http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/</a> for more information on both of<br>these exciting events!<br><br>Cindy Archuleta<br>Community Relations Manager<br>Verant Interactive</I></UL>Thank you!

Gordon's made quite a few posts on the boards this afternoon.  Here's the latest from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013109.html"><b>Twinked Corpses</b></a><br>Interestingly enough, the GMs get /petitions every night from people who lost a twinked up corpse like this. Needless to say that it isn't something that we can intervene in.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013119.html"><b>Resist Bug</b></a><br>I'm aware of this happening at resists over 255, however this is the first I've heard of it being over 200. Are you certain that this is the case?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013106.html"><b>Abusive Users</b></a><br>If she's being threatened in that manner, she'll want to /report the text then /petition to let the GMs know that a /report has been filed. Providing that the /report shows the threats, he'll certainly be removed from game. I'm not really sure why she got the response that you've indicated, so if more information can be provided I'll be happy to look into it. <br><br>Secondly, if she has a restraining order against him, chances are that it prohibits any contact between them. The courts would probably not be too happy about learning that he's contacted her on the internet.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012952.html"><b>Putting Stuff in the Bank</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Would it not be easier to be able to put thing in a bag that is already in the bank?]</i></font> <br><br>This is indeed one of the UI enhancements on Rowyl's list. I'm not sure yet if it's one that will make the final cut due to the number of good suggestions, however we'll give it a shot.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012966.html"><b>Dupe Bug Question</b></a><br>Good suggestion Wyld, and to answer Sabaack's question, we'd certainly take intent into account. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013068.html"><b>Class Changes</b></a><br>We have nothing in particular planned right now. We do plan on retesting all of the classes to ensure that they fall where we feel that they should prior to freezing the classes. Most of these tests have already been completed for most of the melee classes, with only a few more steps necessary to finalize those.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012942.html"><b>More on the Story Elements in EQ</b></a><br>On one hand we have players asking for more of a story line to be overtly implemented into the game. On the other, there's also those who prefer an open "floorplan" if you will. In either case, we want to provide for both players. <br><br>"Story" requires that some limits be placed on the breadth of things that players can do. There's really no way around that. Whether the story is done in short bursts, such as quests, or in large multi-zone epics, there is some limit on what you can do to take part in the story.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012754.html"><b>Determining Balance of the Classes</b></a><br>As the game is and always will be primarily PvE (Player versus Environment), balance in this area has always been the chief concern. Even on the PvP servers, PvE is still the main focus there and affects everyone whether or not they engage in PvP regularly. <br><br>That said we also try to keep things in mind for PvP. For instance, the damage reduction for spells cast by players upon other players is one of the PvP balance mechanisms.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009851-2.html"><b>EQ's Plot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I believe Abashi or Aradune said that there would be a way for verant to relay storied to the players in the future well it must be the DISTANT future because it hasn't happened yet.]</i></font> <br><br>I wanted to wait until I had a time nailed down for this: We'll be debuting a section of our website dedicated to stories in a couple of days. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009837.html"><b>Abolish Disease</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The biggest question here is why aren't the priest classes equal in their ability to deal with diseases and poisons in the end?]</i></font><br><br>Because the classes aren't designed to be equal, but to be balanced. If they were equal they would be interchangable in many cases. As it is designed, you must often make a choice with what class you want to be near. If you are going up against something with really strong poison, you certainly want clerics around. For disease, you'll probably want to add a shaman. If you are looking for something a little more general purpose, there's the druid, with respectable DD, DOTs, healing, buffs, and ports.</UL>

Gordon started this week's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013130.html">Discussion of the Week</a> on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the complete post:<UL><I>I think that there&#8217;s a common misconception going around that, &#8220;All dynamic events consist of GMs going on a killing spree.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t the case, as there are many different types of dynamic events, ranging from the typical raid, to story-telling events, to epic quests with a vast story-line behind them.<br><br>Raids are typically short on story and last anywhere from a half an hour to an hour or two. They usually consist of trio of actor NPCs or so entering an area and running amok until they are killed by a sufficient force of players.<br><br>Story-telling events typically have little-to-no fighting of any kind, and are usually used to tell a story leading up to or concluding an epic quest.<br><br>Epic quests often run several hours and boast a slew of actor NPCs that both tell a story and engage in combat at some point during the quest.<br><br>In addition to these, there are also &#8220;Invasions&#8221; which are more static in nature and deal with a temporary data reset of the zone. Examples of this have been the period undead invasions of Qeynos Hills, or the recent one in Najena that was launched with a small epic quest.<br><br>We realize and agree that there have been problems publicizing the story behind dynamic events, and will be launching a new section of our website in the next couple of days to deal with that issue. However, the question I would like to pose is, what do you want to see in the way that dynamic events are handled? It seems that no matter the event, or the story behind it, there are always some people who felt that the event was nothing but a &#8220;killing spree&#8221;.<br><br>What can we do to make these events more enjoyable for the players?<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Here's an excerpt:<UL><b>GL : What new items are going to be available in the new expansion?</b><br>JB : There will be 6 new sets of armour graphics for each sex/class combination (2 x leather, 2 x chain, 2 x plate). Plus there will be all new weapon and helmet textures along with lots of new items of all types.<br><br><b>GL : What engine does the new expansion use? </b><br>JB : It uses a slightly tweaked version of the graphical engine used in the Kunark Expansion. We did not want to enhance the engine too much, as this would increase the minimum machine specs.</UL>Thanks Mike!

Trakanon has had a rough few days on several servers.  The following news post contains two reports of the slayings:<BLOCKQUOTE>Dragon Force pushes onward, through foggy dark tunnels of stale dank air<br>and into an expansive cavern.

Mages of various religions follow closely<br>behind their larger kin, frequently turning around nervously to see if<br>any devilish beings have taken notice of their presence.

A silent army crests a ledge and set their<br>eyes on the mighty dragon Trakanon.<br><br>Warriors raise their swords still dripping with red blood above their<br>heads, grunting and shouting words of rage and courage.  Paladin's<br>kneel, head pressed against the hilt of their mighty swords blessing<br>their surrounding adventurers.  Powerful priests with glowing eyes of<br>fluorescent blue call upon their gods for support.  Mages with glints of<br>color around the hands and head chant harmoniously in a foreign arcane<br>language.  The sky sizzles with energy and the air is filled with<br>absolute power!<br><br>A battle cry is sound, a massive rush of valorous tanks strewn with<br>armor of unknown lands charge towards the almighty dragon.  The mages<br>chants blend together as one in rhythmic unison, rising to a deafening<br>roar.

The following is this evening's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013015.html"><b>Greed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So let me get this strait, if the item that dropped did not have Necro in it and another class could use it you would not roll?]</i></font> <br><br>I'd only roll for it if: <br><br>-There was no one in the group who could use it, or<br>-The person in the group who could use it already had it or something better. <br><br>-Gordon <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So you have never camped the FBSS or any Item a necro could not use?]</i></font> <br><br>No. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You don't think the Cleric or the Enchanter you just met worked as hard as the warrior in the group when a rare sword drops?]</i></font> <br><br>Sure they worked just as hard, however I imagine that they were doing so to help out their warrior. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Do you not believe you can trade a Item you don't need for one you do?]</i></font> <br><br>I had friends to help get those other items, or obtained a tradable item when there was no class in the group that could use it. <br><br>Of course that's just me. It's up to each player to decide what way they wish to play.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012998.html"><b>Verant's Attitude Toward Solo'ers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What he means is that if you have solo'd your entire career, you will not be making all of the connections with other characters. If I don't know you from Adam and no one else I know does, the odds are we're not going to be to thrilled with the idea of letting you into our group where you may kill us.]</i></font> <br><br>I'd say that's an accurate description of the issues. Grouping is a skill that needs to be developed early on. Certainly, some classes support soloing, but we've always said that soloers not be able to go everywhere and do everything. If going everywhere and doing everything is important to the person who plays a soloable class, I'd certainly recommend that they work on forming relationships early on and throughout the leveling process.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012993.html"><b>How do you pronounce Kunark?</b></a><br>Koo-nark :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012784-2.html"><b>European Players & Overcrowding on Karana</b></a><br>European players do not measurably contribute to server crowding at peak times due to the fact that their prime-time is different from that in the states. I'd attribute crowding on Karana to be more due to the fact that most really don't want to leave. The last split offered to Karana was prepared to move 1200 people, yet only 139 actually requested a move. <br><br>I'm not really sure how to go about splitting up the server further when the community has become so strong that no one wants to leave. We're willing to discuss suggestions of course.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012846.html"><b>Age Discrimination?</b></a><br>First, CS Reps do not have access to account passwords. <br><br>Second, I'm not sure why you see this as an age discrimination issue. In situation number 1, if the person proved that he bought the accounts, they would then be banned. He would not be given access back to them, and it would be up to him to pursue action against the person that sold the account. In situation number 2, we get people calling us all of the time telling us that their account was stolen. They are required to prove ownership to get the account back. If it turns out that they did sell it, and the buyer calls us up, it becomes issue #1, and the account would be banned. In neither case does age come into the equation. <br><br>Original owners are always required to prove ownership, and are given the account back if they can (via a password reset). Buyers are also required to prove that they bought it, however once they do the account it banned. <br><br>We do not allow transfers of accounts, and will not support it nor open ourselves to getting involved with the fraud associated with them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012653.html"><b>Poor Customer Service</b></a><br>I do agree that the way the CSRep phrased his response was poor, and I'd like to extend you our apologies. <br><br>In regards to your query as to whether the decision to change the item to offhand only is final, it indeed is. Though I understand your feelings regarding this issue, the encounter from which this item was obtainable and the quantities that it dropped are not sufficient for the power of the item.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012618.html"><b>Problems With EQ: Crashing</b></a><br>I've heard of heat-crashes before, and it sounds like this is what you may have been experiencing. Kunark is more processer-intensive than the mainland, so would cause more heat to build up. I can see an overclocking your CPU causing a problem like this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012522-4.html"><b>Don't Roll For Loot!</b></a><br>I'd have to agree with the original posters feelings, though somewhat more politely :)  I'd never consider rolling for something that my character could not use if there was someone in the group who could . <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011959.html"><b>Reducing Player Burnout</b></a><br>I believe that the requirement to look at the spellbook goes away at 32 rather than 35. That said, arguments could always be made to have it go away sooner. It's a matter of providing rewards for continuing to gain levels. People gain levels for those rewards, and this is yet another goal that people can reach. We could lower it to 30, but I imagine that we'd see the same requests to lower it to 28, 25, or get rid of it altogether. In this case we've decided that 32 is a good level for that requirment to be overcome.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012461.html"><b>Enchanters Without Breeze</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When you added the Breeze spell to the Enchanter series, I don't understand why you made this spell only purchasable in Kunarak. Since this spell is such a well known Enchanter spell shouldn't all Enchanter guilds sell it?]</i></font> <br><br>The spell was added as part of the Kunark expansion. Kunark expansion spells are available only in Kunark. We did, however, decide that the spell would not be NODROP, thus allowing someone to carry them back to the mainland and sell them there for a profit. In my opinion, it has worked out pretty well in implementation.</UL>

The Ranger class will be upgraded says EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013021.html">formal announcement from the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><i>After a LOT of internal testing, interacting with the community, and major debate, we've decided to upgrade Rangers as follows:<br><br>We will be upping their dodge and parry to near Warrior levels. I don't want to get into specifics yet because we are still fine tuning, but the end result is that a Ranger should be significantly more survivable. <br><br>I'm personally happy with the solution because, rather than just increasing defense and making them more Warrior-like, we've upped skills that are more traditionally associated with Rangers (the view that they are nimble, chain-wearing fighters who often avoid attacks).<br><br>I'd also like to pre-announce a future goal and policy change:<br><br>Soon (we'll announce a date in the future), we're going to completely stop adjusting game balance as it relates to tweaking classes. Recently, we've made more changes than usual due to the level limits being raised from 50 to 60. Soon, however, we're going to come to a point where it stops. <br><br>We'll continue to add content (i.e. items, spells, etc.) and game balance will still be tweaked (and will continue to be tweaked as long as we do add content). But class balance changes as a whole will cease.<br><br>The Ranger upgrade is part of this. I'd say that hopefullly by early 2001 we'll be done.<br><br>Abashi or I will post more on this as we work out the plan in detail internally.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>

Here are the first posts written by Gordon Wrinn and posted to the Gameplay Board today:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010301.html"><b>Selo's Accelerando</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Now I hear (still at work) that Selo's Accelerando has been nerfed.

IF this is the case (it sure seems to be, I trust the people that report it to be true), it would have taken ]</i></font><br><br>I could be wrong, so I'll check tomorrow, but I believe that this change occurred months ago, and that there was discussion relating to it on the boards at that time.

The jolt spell is immensly useful, as tested by several high-level rangers in house, as well as a rogue who found it comparable to Evade. I think that if you give it some time once the new casting time goes in, and learn how to use it effectivly, you'll find it useful as well.</UL>

CGO has a <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/029/130/velious_preview.html">new preview of the Scars of Velious</a> posted at their site.  Again, this article uses mostly the info released by Verant at ECTS but it's a good read none the less.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>After the Coldain Dwarves, you will eventually work your way into the zones that contain the Frost and Storm Giants. These Giants are the enemies of the Dwarves, so may be able to raise your faction with the Giants (i.e. make them like you better) by killing Dwarves (or Dragons). Ultimately, you may be able to bind yourself to the city of the Storm Giants so that you'll be able to return from death to this point. From the Giants you will continue on to face the Dragons. These are likely to be the mightiest creatures in Velious, but again you have the opportunity to raise faction with the Dragons by killing Giants, so the potential to walk unscathed among the mighty serpents does exist. There are of course many other zones on Velious populated with other creatures dire and dangerous, but the Dwarves, Giants, and Dragons are the main players in the power struggle for Velious.</UL>

A new article has been published to <a href="/lore/shadoe">Shadoe's Corner</a> titled <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid968638912,25951,">What Do You Want from Norrath?</a>  If you've ever mumbled, ranted, flamed or complained about design aspects of EverQuest this article is something you might find interesting.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>I have to wonder at some of the things I see posted on the message boards sometimes. Those of you who frequent the boards know what I'm talking about. "The loot in Veeshan's Peak sucks!" "The loot in the planes suck!" "Item stats are too low for my Black Featherduster of Doom!" "Give monks better class weapons!" "Why is the necromancer able to give himself mana, and not wizards who need it most?" "The game is unplayable for me after 35 because you don't care about my class!" "I'm tired of taking so long to get anywhere in Norrath! Make NPCs able to teleport!"<br><br>I find myself questioning how people became so egocentric about their characters. Is it so hard to take a step back from your own selfish desires and take a look at the big picture of what Verant is trying to deliver with EverQuest? Is it so hard to see that if Verant bowed and scraped to each and every player demand presented on the message boards, that the game itself would quickly become the very icon of boredom and drudgery?</UL>Thanks Shadoe!

A few Sunday posts were made today by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012300.html"><b>Aradune's Ranger Comments</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Aradune says "I have not played a high level ranger" Testing doesn't Exist]</i></font> <br><br>Personally, I don't think the fact that the Vice President of premuim games doesn't play a high level character of every class to be indicative of "Testing doesn't exist". <br><br>We have a team of designers and developers, and I can't think of a class that isn't played, to a high level by someone on that team. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1- 2 months ago Bards got a higher level charm, the first couple days bards were charming Innoruuk and Cazic thule. The charm was horribly bugged. Did these glorious testers ever test this? No]</i></font> <br><br>Some things get by in the testing process. With litterally tens of thousands of actions that can be completed by any character class, unforeseen things are bound to occur. In this case, code was put in to avoid what you mentioned, and just didn't work as intended. So a few bards had some unforeseen benefits for a little while. No harm was really done. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2- "I have not played a high level Ranger" Aradune, quite frankly I question whether you, or anyone at Verant has ever played a high level character. I've seen numerous claims by Abashi and yourself that there are high level players that work for VI. Then why wouldn't they pick up on the Ranger deficiancies? Where was the testing in beta of Kunark?]</i></font> <br><br>See my first paragraph. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3- Plane of Sky. Who can ever forget Abashi's famous quote. "Plane of Sky items make other planar items look like rusty weapons". Frankly, this zone has a couple good items in it and the rest of the items are pitiful. Where was the testing, why didn't anyone ever take a DEEP look at these items and announce their weakness? It's been MONTHS, nothing has been done yet.]</i></font> <br><br>The quote was "SOME Plane of Sky weapons...", and this is true. That said there still are some modifications necessary. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1- Chardok- What an absolute waste of time for such a beautiful zone. Who was the guy/girl that itemized this zone? It's pathetic! For such a neat looking layout where was the imagination in the actual items? Why wasn't someone there testing these dungeons for the treasures and the Risk/Reward? ]</i></font><br><br>One of the problems with the way the game works is that it appears that players will always go to the place with the best loot, even if it causes that zone to be horrendously overcrowded. Unfortunately, not every zone can be stocked with the "best loot". <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2- Sebilis- Oppsss I'm sorry, I meant to say Extended Lower Guk. Aradune, what are you going to do in two months when there are 200+ people in Lower Sebilis fighting for camping spots? Ever wonder why sebilis is getting so crowded?]</i></font> <br><br>See my last paragraph. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3- Veeshans Peek- What's so different about Veeshan's peek and Sebilis? You spend a weekend in Sebilis, get a 31/37 staff, very nice one handers, plenty of spells, and other odds and ends that are VERY good for LITTLE risk with a comptent group. Yes, that's right little risk. The risk in Veeshan's peek? It's tremendous, you have to fight TOUGH dragons, very tough fast spawning Guardian Wurms, and risk hard earned hours of experience in hopes of something better than Sebilis. Where is the sense in this? Why wasn't this even tested? Does anyone at Verant play Everquest?]</i></font> <br><br>I really don't see the complaint here. Yes, you can get good items from Sebilis. It's only "little risk", because it's crowded, because people crowd the places with the best loot. At some point perhaps Veeshan's peak will get crowded. Of course due to the way the zone is set up, I doubt that it will ever get so crowded that it's considered "little risk".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012397.html"><b>Upcoming MMORPGs</b></a><br>Hey, don't forget that RPGs aren't the only thing you can tack an MMO on to.

Here's the latest quotes and excerpts generated by Verant's Gordon Wrinn:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012275.html"><b>What happened to Discussion of the Week?</b></a><br>Yeah, the sort week messed up my plans this week. I've an idea for another one Monday based upon some of the ideas in the thread. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012260.html"><b>"Will warriors in the Best of the Best be buffed to 60 on test?"</b></a><br>No, they have to work with whatever level and equipment that they come in with when their characters are transferred over. Those of lesser level, or a race with lesser hitpoints will have to be that much more skillful.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012208.html"><b>Mana Bar for Melee Classes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why not take away the mana bar for pure-melee classes? I just don't see the purpose in having an empty bar (save for that one blue pixel at the front ) sitting there. Anyway, just a suggestion]</i></font> <br><br>I look at it as a placeholder. There are many people who play both casters and melee classes, and I'd guess that it would take a short while to adjust to even a slightly different UI. <br><br>In any case, it's one bar and really doesn't hurt anything. I'll mention it to Rowyl, but I doubt it would be changed since it's such a minor issue that really doesn't affect anything.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012172.html"><b>Of Rangers and Lies</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, did Verant lie to rangers?]</i></font><br><br>My first instict was to delete the thread consdiering the "Lies... damned lies" comment. Calling me or us collectively liars will cause a warning to be placed on your account, espicially when you misquote something to establish that fact. <br><br>Then it occurred to me that it should be refuted rather than just deleted, for the sake of others reading the posts here. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi said no class would ever be fixed or enhanced ever again. (6)]</i></font> <br><br>#6 (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011782.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011782.html</a>) did not say anything of the sort. If you were going to summarize the post, I would say that #6 said that we are at the point that any enhancement made to one class will upset another. It's happened with every class-enhancement we've made for some time, and should be agreeable as a fact. If we started making every change that could get a couple hundred people in support of it, we'd 1) never be done making changes as each change would raise issues for another class, and 2) actively kill the game since it would no longer be a challenge after a while. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi said monks were getting a carrying weight enhancement. (7)]</i></font><br><br>#7 incidently occurred in the same post as #6. <br><br>Anyway, your accusation of lying is dependant upon your paraphrase of #6 being true, which it wasn't.</UL>

Spotted on <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com">Voodoo Extreme</a> that Games Domain has scored a <a href="http://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview/zones/previews/sep00/everquest.html">new interview with Scott McDaniel</a>, Executive Director of marketing and PR for Sony Online Entertainment.  The subjects in the interview focuses on Velious and the upcoming Sovereign.  Here's an excerpt:<UL><b>GD: What kinds of characters can we expect to bump into?</b><br><br><i>SM: We have all new characters, such as Walrus Men and an array of Dragons and Giants. Character design on the players' part can be as much or as little as they want. You can basically create a character from the tone of their skin right through to what special skills or mental agility they have. Upper level characters will be able to interact with the new environment and new races of monsters with their own political system will inhabit the areas that players will have to explore.</i></UL>

Our network affiliate PC.IGN has published a <a href="http://pc.ign.com/previews/15361.html">new preview of the Scars of Velious</a>.  The article comes complete with several screenshots and concept artwork sketchings.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>Unlike Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious will, for the most part, be a land upgrade. There won't be any new races or classes added to the game...just more landmass. The Scars expansion will feature a new continent that will increase the playing field of the game with 16 new zones suitable for players level 30 and up to explore and hunt. "Why 30 and above?," you may ask. Well, according to producer Jeff Butler, the vast majority of EQ's player base falls between 30th and 40th level, so this expansion gives them a fresh continent to explore as well as giving newbies something to strive for. </UL>Check it out!

Here's an accurate report of the real slaying of Trakanon on Tarew Marr:<BLOCKQUOTE>After 12 attempts, Enlightened Dark of Tarew Marr<br>finally killed Trakanon. The Battle with him was<br>short,<br>and he very nearly defeated us for the 13th time. But<br>we somehow prevailed! Thanks to all that were invited<br>on this guild raid to help us suceed in what has been<br>a major thorn in our side for months! <br><br>Loot was a mana robe, shaman breastplate, and five<br>teeth!

The following report was brought to us by Uglar:<BLOCKQUOTE><s>Greetings! Your fatty warrior Uglar brings news of Trakanon's Death on the Tarew Marr server.<br> <br>On Friday, Sept. 8th, 2000, 36 brave adventures from the guild Dead on Arrival gathered in the depths of Sebilis and laid waist to the evil plague dragon for the first time in Tarew Marr's history.

In the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-2.html">mother of all Bard posts</a>, Gordon Wrinn tackled the subject getting the most buzz on the forums these days:<UL>Do you even plan on reading any of these threads? Or do you just want fewer threads so they are easier to lock? <br><br><b><i>I plan to read this one for now. <br><br></b></i>Why can't you mez level 1 snakes in Freeport? <br><br><b><i>A player called me on the phone today shortly before I left work. We chatted for a while about various bard-related issues and this is one of them that came up. While he was on the phone I figured I'd check it out. I was unable to reproduce the claim that lullaby works better on level 1 npcs at level 15, than at level 60. In fact, I noticed a substantial decrease in primary resists, though secondaries remained constant, as they should. <br><br>In both cases I was able to mez the level one creatures a good percentage of the time. <br><br></b></i>I have a question Abashi. Do you or anyone else read and post to the class forums. Just a thought that maybe this board would not get so flooded if the other boards were given a little feedback. <br><br><b><i>Not in an official capacity. However, I imagine that some of the designers, programmers, and gms read them from time to time as they are also players of the game. The players will bring their issues to whereever they are most likely to be seen or receive a comment, so I think it's probably better to have it all in one place. I remember back in beta when Brad and team would visit the EQVault boards (all of them), and it usually led to the same posts being cross-posted to all of the boards. <br><br></b></i>If I think you are a company of liars and cheats is that a flame or an opinion? <br><br><b><i>That would be a flame, and you know it. Please don't make posts of that nature again. A lie requires intent to mislead or deceive as a statement of fact. For instance, "Bards are balanced" is not a lie no matter how much you disagree with it, or how much data you come up with to support your position. It is an opinion. "Alchemy is working" was a mistake. A mistake isn't a lie. "We hope to have it fixed next week." is not a promise to absolutely get it fixed next week, and therefore not a lie if we don't make it. <br><br></b></i>Are you going to get GZ and Brad on here to explain why they went back on their word? Why they lied to use, then ignored our posts, only to have someone who isn't qualified to test our songs test them? <br><br><b><i>What word? And what lie? And as far as Ester's qualifications, she's very good at what she does. If you still don't accept that, then I'll also tell you that GZ was involved in the latest round of testing. <br><br></b></i>Make bard Mez as good as necro at least.<br>25-30 percent resist rates by design are not acceptable <br><br><b><i>There is no way that we can make a no-mana song as powerful as a mez as good as a spell that uses mana, which is the reason that it was changed to its current state last August or so. <br><br></b></i>There have been several instances where one of the developers states there is a problem, and then you come along and say it is working as intended. Now I'm not trying to flame, but, as I see it, you are over-riding the programmers and developers. Are you the main person who decides the all of the issues in EQ? <br><br><b><i>I think that there is little understanding on the level of communications that goes on behind the scenes. Depending on the issue, I may or may not bring other people into the decision process. I was hired due to my understanding of the big picture, being tuned in to what the design team was trying to accomplish. In many cases, I often have a better idea of this than anyone on a large scale, besides of course the producers and lead designers. That is why I make decisions in regard to what issues, for instance, that I'll bring to a tuning meeting for discussion. <br><br>Some other things do require a lot of communication between the various members of the team, and it is my responsibility to identify those issues and engage the appropriate people. I translate specific-issue "design speak" into english and see how it fits into the big picture. <br><br></b></i>It seems to me that, lately, you are TRYING to get people mad!!!! <br><br><b><i>Probably the biggest downside to what I do is that I get to take credit whenever a mistake is made by anyone. That's part of the job. It's not my job to point fingers at individual members, but to accept responsibility for the mistakes on behalf of Verant. <br><br>I of course take no joy in being the bearer of bad news. I'd much rather only have to announce the good stuff that pleases everyone, but both components are part of the job. So yes, that means that if a programmer says something that is in error, it may appear that I'm "over-riding" him even though that isn't really the case. I also get to take responsibility for my own mistakes (of which I've made many), and I think that most people here know that I own up to them. <br><br></b></i>Dis-satifaction is 100 times more infectious that satifaction is. <br><br><b><i>Don't I know it :)<br><br></b></i>Could we see why the effectiveness of a song decreases on mobs as a Bard's level increases? Why do multiple mobs get two resists on a song that has an automatic resist check every 6 seconds anyway? <br><br><b><i>I think that I've effectively addressed these issues above, but I'll elaborate. The original implementation of the song made it much too powerful considering its lack of a mana control. <br><br></b></i>What is the Vision for Bards use? <br><br><b><i>That's for you to figure out and establish given the tools that we've provided. What is at your disposal? What can you do? Where can you excel? That is our vision for the bard class. <br><br></b></i>What are the parent classes for Bards? <br><br><b><i>Bards are not really hybrids despite having the same experience table. They are a class all to their own. If I had to name something, I'd call them part warrior, part rogue, part enchanter, part druid, and part shaman. <br><br></b></i>Why are bards one of the least played high level classes? <br><br><b><i>They are difficult to play well, and their name doesn't scream offensive power like some other classes. <br><br></b></i>Why are dozens of high level bards quitting over this issue? <br><br><b><i>Dozens of high-level players quit over every issue imaginable. Often I think that in cases like this, the player is burnt out and is looking for a reason to bail out or start a new class. <br><br></b></i>Why am I still holding a flute when playing a drum? <br><br><b><i>Evidently the drum animations aren't in, or perhaps we don't have anything that looks like a drum when held. I've not personally looked at the appearence in game to see. <br><br></b></i>How was chains imbalancing the game? <br><br><b><i>Chains had the power to reduce the effective movement of a fleeing NPC to zero, causing it to be an effective root. However, were an actual root spell used, the NPC would have fought having no other option available (fight or flight). It had fleeing mobs at a dead stop, yet not fighting back. <br><br></b></i>What he really wants is a single thread he can ignore instead of having to scroll through pages and pages of threads looking for the "cool" ones he can answer. <br><br><b><i>No, I just don't want to see one issue monopolizing the front page requiring me to pop around several different threads that say basically the same thing. Hopefully this way I'll be able to post one or two big responses in a place that everyone can find them. <br><br></b></i>You know the ones..."Hey Abashi, what's your favorite color" that seem to get a reply 2 minutes after being posted. <br><br><b><i>Deep metallic black. <br><br></b></i>Heh gotta love the 'working as intended' standard reply. I just wish VI would finally have GZ write down EXACTLY how each spell is INTENDED to work so that there wont be these ugly surprises months after you start playing a class... It's happened too many times with my enchanter, necro, druid, and ranger... <br><br><b><i>Most spells work as intended until someone finds a way to make it work in a way that wasn't intended. People think that new way they've discovered is the way it is supposed to work, so when we make changes so that it only works as intended, it's perceived as a nerf. <br><br></b></i>No, they don't plan on reading it. A while ago Abashi posted something saying that 'Class issue were going to still be read, but not replys to anymore.' Raise your hands if you believe that anyone is going to bother reading them. <br><br><b><i>*raises his hand* <br><br>I'll make an exception in this case for a few days since it's on a new and hot issue. <br><br></b></i>Hows this Abashi, the day you start really, really listening to us, and making real changes will be the same day we start listening to you and changing how much negative stuff is on the board. <br><br><b><i>Please don't confuse "no" with not listening. We always listen, just sometimes the answer isn't the one people want. <br><br></b></i>Why do y'all seem to feel that your inability to mesmerize negates your class? <br>Bards are all-around nifty <br><br><b><i>I agree completely. <br><br></b></i>Because we're slowly being nerfed into a manna battery, regen source for other classes. <br><br><b><i>I wouldn't reduce it to that, but bards are indeed supposed to be a support class. <br><br></b></i>Wouldn't it be easier to just fix the song than to avoid the issue for 10 months, then piss off 80% of your bard community defending yet another unintentional nerf? <br><br><b><i>There's nothing unintentional about the way that lullaby is currently working. That said, I do indeed wish that we'd done all of the work and announced our findings sooner rather than later. For that, I sincerely apologize. <br><br></b></i>People CAN'T IMAGINE that you want these songs to be this completely useless. Even if it IS as designed, a concept which I myself have a great deal of trouble adjusting to, then your design is broken and needs fixing. <br><br><b><i>They aren't completely useless, just reduced in usefulness once the targets go over level 30. That said, we're not opposed to revisiting pixie strike and twilight to see if they need to be changed positively now that we know that lullaby is working correctly. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>And here's the latest follow-up post:<UL>If that's the case, it SEEMS you might be open to better crowd control WITH manacost for bards. I see a gaping spot in the 49th level spell just waiting to be filled?<br><br><b><i>We're also open to reexamining pixie strike. It's effectiveness as a single-target mez might be something we can improve given that enchanters can essentially keep a single-target mez up for zero-mana as well.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Since the first infobit post today, Gordon Wrinn has made the following new posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012245.html"><b>Melee Tests</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Would you please make a statement about the defense tests you are/were conducting for melee classes.]</i></font> <br><br>Jeff Butler is personally investigating the situation by running those tests, and to my knowledge no final determination has been made yet. Jeff just came back from Europe where he attended ECTS (The European E3). This is slow going as we certainly don't have any knee-jerk reactions, so I appreciate the patience. <br><br>One thing that did come out so far is another casting time reduction for jolt. I believe we're giving it the same casting time as the feign death spell.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011990.html"><b>Bad Names Ignored?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are silly names no longer being changed in EQ? I remember hearing that when EQ was to come out on the market character names would have to be in theme. I see names everyday that are not.]</i></font> <br><br>Names are being changed when they violate the naming policy. Unforunately "silly" is subjective. Of the name examples you mentioned, only one would be immediately ruled inappropriate. "Twomoons" would only create a problem if one tried to get a last name of "Overmiami" or something of that nature. "Physikal" would only be a problem if the last name was something along the lines of "Attraction". <br><br>That said, a name has to be noticed and escalated when a GM or Senior Guide is online to get it changed. The obvious exception to this is if a name is horribly vulgar. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011886.html"><b>Roror and His Faction</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: After reading several previous post regarding this subject, I was under the impression that Roror was to be returned to the Beta Neutral faction. This evening, I ran in to him and died rather quickly. I petitioned (Druzzil Ro), got and assistant guide who forwardedd the question to higher authorities. Later, I received a tell from Teniel (not exact), who said that Roror had been Beta Neutral and that the resent change was to make him one of the lizard factions in Cazic Thule.]</i></font> <br><br>He is going back to betaneutral, it did not however get patched the last time we pushed zone data. I hope to see it go in the next one.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012214-2.html"><b>Guide Banning Closed For Discussion</b></a><br>As a persons account status is a private matter between them and us, even if they choose to publicize it, we won't be discussing the matter further on the boards. As it is a privacy issue, posts in regards to that subject will be deleted. Please do not open additional threads on the subject. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012212.html"><b>Posting on the Official Forums</b></a><br>We're quite pleased with the direction that the board has taken since we implemented the changes only allowing active EverQuest account holders the ability to post. It's caused the overall tone here to change greatly for the better, allowing us to raise the quality and quantity of our communication with the customers. <br><br>That said, there's been some slippage over the past day or so, leading to 15 account warnings, 4 suspensions, and 2 bannings for posts made in the past 24 hours. There is still too much baseless flaming, personal attacks, insults, and general discourtesy going on. We&#8217;d like everyone to feel free to discuss opinions and issues, however there is no opinion worth stating that must contain discourteous content in order for the point to be made. People who cannot post without engaging in such discourse, who also want to remain EverQuest subscribers, should not do so on these boards. <br><br>I want to reiterate our commitment to maintain these boards as a viable medium for communications with our customers. If they cannot serve that purpose, and if it is not advantageous to have them (both for you and for us), they won&#8217;t be something that we&#8217;ll continue to have on the official site. <br><br>We appreciate everyone&#8217;s cooperation in keeping these forums civilized and respectful.</UL>
