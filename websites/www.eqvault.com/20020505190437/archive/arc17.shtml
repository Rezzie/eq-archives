One of the most active topics Alan tackled on the Developer's Corner today was that of the issue of <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000323.html">Bard Item Effect Stacking</a>.  Here's the intitial post:<UL>Many bards have noticed that something went wrong with the emergency patch last night. Here's what happened.<br><br>We had to emergency patch to remove an evil duping bug. I'm not going to detail that out, as those details aren't pertinent to the tale at hand.<br><br>We were also patching to remove some bard stacking problems. There was a way that a bard could, basically, cheat the system and double up on buffs.<br><br>To fix this problem we changed the way that spells cast from items work for bards. Bards using items that cast spells (not songs) will have those spells act just like regular spells, where they were acting like songs before. Bard songs stack with just about anything, and spells have their own sets of stacking rules. Bards casting spells from items were able to ignore the stacking restrictions of those spells.<br><br>We changed that. Bards using spells from items will find that they stack just like the spells normally do, not like bard songs.<br><br>However, one of the components of the patch didn't make it to the servers.<br><br>That component is the one that tells songs cast off of items to act like songs, not spells.<br><br>Ok, this is getting complicated. Basically, right now songs cast from items are acting just like spells cast from items, and are trying to stack like spells not like songs. This is causing a lot of item-cast songs to not stack as they should.<br><br>Having just brought the servers down, we are very reluctant to do so again right away. We're not sure when the update needed to fix this will happen, but it might not be until the next regular patch. Please bear with us until we can get this patched. It took us a long time to remove this 'perk', so maybe you can forgive us for taking a little while to fix the fix&#8230;<br><br>Alan</UL>This is follow-up #1:<UL><b>"We were also patching to remove some bard stacking problems. There was a way that a bard could, basically, cheat the system and double up on buffs."<br><br>I am SO offended by this remark. Why is using a part of the game YOU design, in a helpful way, "cheating"???<br><br>To tar all bards as cheaters in this way is just beyond belief.<br><br>You REALLY need to work on your PR. I can't put into words how awful you made me feel, after playing EQ for 2 years and serving as a guide for one year.<br><br>- Lyzandia Starsinger</b><br><br>That was probably a poor choice of words. It was not intended to imply that anyone was doing anything wrong. I apologize.<br><br>Let me clarify a few things about this change.<br><br>Bards have been able to stack some spells on top of themselves and other spells that were never intended to be stacked. That was broken and never intended to work as it has.<br><br>Bard songs are intended to stack with everything. They will continue to do so.<br><br>Bard songs that are generated by items will continue to stack just like bard songs sung by bards, they will stack with everything. Most bard unique items will also continue to stack with everything. For example, the Singing Short Sword will stack as it always has.<br><br>The only spells that bards will no longer be able to stack will be spells from items, spells that were designed with stacking rules in mind and were never intended to be stacked with everything in the manner of a bard song.<br><br>Our next patch will be Tuesday. We'll have the Epic (and the Shaman Epic&#8230;) along with the rest of this fixed then.<br><br>Again, I'm sorry for the error in the patch and the delay in repairing it.<br><br>Alan</UL>Here's follow-up #2:<UL>I've been less than clear on this whole thing. Let me pass on some information from Lawrence that should make this more clear.<br><br>quote:<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>In order to prevent some bard stacking exploits we implemented a change to bard stacking code as it pertains to spells cast by bards using items. When bards cast spells that are not flagged as being a bard song <61 the bard stacking code is not applied. I flagged the effect on the bard epic to be a level 1 bard song in the spdat to accommodate this change, however the spdat was not pushed in last nights emergency patch. Until our next patch when we can push the spdat the bard epic effect will have stacking issues. Basically Bard stacking code will not be applied to it.<br><br>- Lawrence Poe<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Hopefully that is clearer. The problem occurred when the spdat file didn't get pushed to the servers during the emergency patch, and so the effects on some items didn't get flagged properly.<br><br>Alan</UL>And finally, the latest follow-up:<UL><b>What exactly do you mean when you say bard songs stack with everything? I know that a lot of songs will not stack with other songs and they also do not stack with other spells. One good example is our Psalm line where they give resistance as well as a damage sheild. These do not stack with druid damage sheilds... It just over writes them... perhaps your definition of stacking is different. Can you claify what you mean by stacking with EVERYTHING because they certainly don't.<br><br>Zedia</b><br><br>They'll be stacking just as they used to stack. They will follow the bard stacking rules.<br><br>Today seems to be a bad day for me to be trying to explain things. I'm sorry for the confusion.<br><br>Alan</UL>

We wanted to make certain that when we did it we could be confident that the results matched our desires, and that our desires were well considered. <br><br>We're certainly not ignoring Dark Ages of Camelot or any of the other games that are coming up. But we're not working any differently than we always have. I can say that we're honestly impressed with the work that other people are doing. And, sure, that drives us a bit. But our goal has always been to make EverQuest the best game of its type. This change works toward the betterment of the game.<br> <br><b>That said, I do have one question: Are you also considering increasing caster damage output?</b><br> <br>We are going to review casters in much the same way we reviewed melee. Melee is, however, a lot easier to quantify. It's not so easy with casters. Damage output is by no means the only thing that a caster brings to a fight. It's much more complicated to evaluate the effects of debuffs, haste, buffs and even evacs when talking about combat effectiveness. But we certainly have plans to review spell casting. <br><b>If the answer is yes, more power to you. Do it in your own time, make sure it works, and thank you in advance :)</b><br><br>:)<br><br><b>If the answer is no, I have to ask: Why not? PLEASE don't tell me "Luclin focus items". Besides the obvious counter that very few people will have them (due to Trivial Loot Code preventing you from killing green mobs for them, and the other mobs that con blue to 55+ characters being camped 24/7...Obviously some will trickle down, but consider melee haste items as a parallel...They stay fairly rare), the fact remains that casters since beta have been based on being gearless. For a long time you've told us that's the price we pay for coming up short behind the melees in end-game power - they can get gear to improve them, while caster gear improvements are fairly limited. </b><br><br>Well, while casters are less dependent on gear, it's certainly unfair to claim that they are based on being 'gearless'. As for the end-game power, the idea is that nobody should come up short. Gear has to be a consideration when determining what is and what is not enough oomph. The focus of this analysis will indeed consider Shadows of Luclin ideas. We do need to look at the whole game when doing this. We certainly can't make changes in the name of 'balance' and then add items in an expansion that blow that balance into little bits. <br><br><b>Fair enough, then. You've increased their power a bit - could we get an increase too, in order to stay in line with them? <br><br>Branar<br>60th Enchanter<br>The Seventh Hammer </b><br><br>Actually, you have to look carefully at what we've done. <br><br>We have not increased the power of melee classes as a whole. <br><br>We have, using warriors as a sort of measuring bar, brought the melee classes and hybrids in line with each other. Warriors should now be a little more flexible in that they should find more use for two-handed weapons. But they haven't gained the ability to deal more damage. <br><br>What we did was to carefully dissect the damage-dealing ability of all the melee-type classes (for sake of this discussion this includes hybrids) and we determined our goals for them when compared to each other. It was an internal comparison. The combat ability of these classes should now where we want them, relative only to each other. <br><br>Fopoode wrote: <br><br><b>Just want to say how positive I'm feeling about recent changes and proposed ones. <br><br>The feign death fix was great and much appreciated. I haven't had chance to check out the TLC quest item drop changes yet, but if this allows higher levels to do more quests for fun and/or faction then this is great also. <br><br>Having read the test patch message the new melee changes seem to have balanced the melee and hybrid classes against each other IMO near perfectly. (well on paper - obviously I haven't had chance to experience them yet) Fixing some long standing issues and make several classes more viable in the highend game. I hope these all go live. :)</b><br><br>You bring up something that I wanted to stress (and that we stressed a lot in the Test patch message). THIS IS ONLY ON TEST. Though we've done a lot of internal testing, we want to see these changes work in game a while before we put them live. We may make further changes. We might find that these changes mess everything up and they might not go live at all. Certainly we believe that these changes are well thought out and will be just the thing that is needed. But they are on Test for testing. So please don't assume they are certain to go live. <br><br>We need to be able to use the Test server to test things. The arrival of something on Test is not a promise that it will make it into the game. <br><br><b>Absor, <br><br>I've just finished reading all of the changes proposed to balance out melee classes and I'm very happy with all of them. However, the defensive change for rangers should be a reverse parity of the offensive increase for the other hybrids. As Paladins and Shadowknights receive 25 points of Offense and corollary weapon skills post 50, Rangers should receive 25 points of defense. I think you will find that changing the increase from 10 to 25 points will both elate your Ranger population and refrain from frustrating or angering any of the other melee classes. After all, Rangers will still be the only non Priest, non Caster class who's defense does not cap at 255. <br><br>Khross<br>Level 60 Warder of Tunare<br>Innoruuk Server </b><br><br>The ten point increase meets our desires for the defense of Rangers. I can strongly emphasize that we've taken a lot of time and careful calculation to determine those ten points. This analysis was done without consideration of who might be upset and who might be elated. When options were available for ways to make needed improvements, then we looked at what we thought people would like the most. <br><br>This isn't to say that we don't worry about what people think. But when this examination was done we wanted our decisions to be driven by fact and numbers primarily. When all is said and done, we expect to be very confident that we've done the right thing as far as the balance needed to make the melee classes fit our goals. <br><br>And 25 points of offense is not directly comparable to 25 points of defense. Two different skills, unrelated to each other except for the fact that they involve combat. You can't directly compare them, and it's unfair to assume that they have the same meaning to the ability of a class. <br><br>Keep in mind that the hybrid classes will also receive examination when we review spell casting in the near future. <br><br>Alan</UL>

This is a copy of the latest Test Server patch message as posted by Mr. VanCouvering on the Dev's Corner:<UL>***Test Server Disclaimer***<br><br>Playing on the Test server will give users an opportunity to experience changes firsthand before they are made available to the live world servers. However, it should be noted that due to frequent changes and revisions, enhancements made to the Test server will not necessarily make it to the live servers. Any quest-related bugs should be submitted via e-mail to eqtesting@verant.com. In addition, the Test server has NO official Game Master support, therefore, if an item(s) is lost due to a bug, server outage, or any other reason, there will be NO reimbursement for the lost goods. It should also be noted that due to the nature of testing, the Test server may be brought down at anytime, without notice. Finally, it may be necessary from time to time to execute character and/or equipment wipes in order to maintain the integrity of the test platform.<br><br><br>September 18th, 6:00pm<br>-------------------------<br><br>** Melee changes **<br><br><br>We're wrapping up an extensive look at the way that melee works in EverQuest. These changes are appearing now on Test (in fact, most of them are working as of right now). We wanted to make you aware of these changes in some detail so that you can give us the feedback that we need on them. Please try these changes out and comment on results that you've seen.<br><br>We will be beginning our final analysis on casters in the very near future.<br><br>* Melee Tables * <br><br>Melee combat is based, at least in part, on tables that determines how each class functions. Up until 50th level melee and hybrid classes are on the same table, with the exception being monks who are on a separate table (one that has them doing more damage). At 50th level warriors, rogues and rangers were all moved to the monk table along with the monk, who did not receive a new separate table.<br><br>The problem here is that post 50th level the disparity between these two tables, combined with lower combat abilities for the hybrids as well as a more restricted selection of weapons acted as a double (almost triple) penalty, making them less effective in combat than was really intended.<br><br>Therefore, all melee and hybrid classes will be basing their combat off the melee table once they reach 51st level. This should increase the combat effectiveness of hybrids noticeably.<br><br>Monks, however, are intended to be somewhat better at dealing out damage in combat than warriors. To slightly improve their combat prowess they will be working from an improved combat table once they reach 55th level and again at 60th level. This will improve the combat ability of monks somewhat, essentially placing them a half a step ahead of everyone else in toe-to-toe combat in the same way that they were prior to 50th level. The rogue will still maintain a margin of superiority when you consider their ability to backstab.<br><br><br>* Two-Handed Weapons *<br><br>The effectiveness of these weapons falls slightly below our desire for them. This tends to make those that rely on them most often (shadowknights and paladins) also fall slightly behind our desires for their damage output, at least at levels beyond 50. We'd also like to see a broader range of weapons used by higher level warriors, and it would be nice to see two-handers as a more viable option.<br><br>Therefore, we will be increasing the minimum damage of these weapons for all classes once they reach 50th level. There will be an increase in the minimum damage of two-handed weapons based on the wielder's level and delay of the weapon. The higher level the character and the larger the delay, the bigger the bonus. Obviously we're not going to give out exact numbers, but this should result in a solid increase in damage output when using two-handed weapons.<br><br>We also believe that there has been a bit of disparity between the very high-end one-handed weapons and their counterpart two-handed weapons. The ultra-high end one-handed weapons are comparatively better than their two-handed counterparts. We will, on a case by case basis, be improving many of the high-end two-handed weapons. Because this is essentially a fix for an oversight on our parts, we will be making these changes retroactive (meaning you won't have to trade the items in or hunt for new ones, existing weapons will just change).<br><br><br>* Rangers *<br><br>We've also noticed that rangers, while intended to be hit harder in combat than other melee/hybrid classes, are getting hit harder than we planned. Again, this only happens in the 50+ level range. So we will be increasing the defense cap for rangers again slightly to 210 at 60th level. Exactly how these points will be distributed is uncertain, but probably just one point per level after 50. We will also be giving rangers triple attack.<br><br><br>* Monks *<br><br>Monks will be getting triple attack. This along with the improvement of their combat tables should place them about where we want them, combat-wise.<br><br><br>* Bards *<br><br>Bards are indeed intended to have the least ability to deal damage physically of all the classes we're discussing. However, with their lack of double attack they didn't meet even our intentions for their damage output. We will, therefore, be raising the offense and one-handed weapon caps for bards over 50th level to match that of warriors. This should place their ability to do damage by means of melee within our intended range without making them more effective than the knights at any given level, since double attack is a potent melee skill that bards do not get.<br><br><br>Obviously we want to see how this all pans out when applied to the game. Feel free to send your comments on the results you see to us through the Developer's Corner on our web site, or contact our staff if you see them on the Test Server.<br><br>It is very important that you understand that these are changes that we are testing. These changes (and any others made on the Test Server) may not be moved to Live Servers. After all, that's the reason we're testing them.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

In the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000313.html">second and final update</a> of the night, Steve Burke makes another cameo along with a few parting commments from Alan:<UL><b>There are 10 coldain quest rings.<br><br>There are now 4 qeynos quest investigator badges.<br>Unfortunately, there are still only 7 coldain quest shawls.<br>The quest text following shawl 7 speaks of more shawls to come. Additionally, there is a quote floating around purported to be from the Verant employee in-the-know stating that there would be 10 coldain quest shawls.<br><br>Unfortunately, I've also heard a rumor that the brilliant designer that made the ring and shawl quests was fired. I also see the shadows of Luclin over the horizon.<br><br>So, I worry that you have decided to forego creation of further coldain prayer shawl quests.<br><br>It has been a _LONG_ time now since the 7th shawl was added. Could you _please_ confirm that the 8th shawl is still slated for development? Hoping so, could you estimate when it might be live? Pre or post Luclin?<br><br>Thank you,<br>Flintnilf</b><br><br><br>quote:<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Flintnilf,<br><br>Firstly, I assure you the rumors of my termination have been greatly exaggerated. I'm still here and staying very busy helping to make Luclin the best expansion it can be.<br><br>I regret that I was unable to complete the implementation of the final quests for the Coldain Shawl before Luclin production began. It's still my intention to implement the remaining segments, but my current workload has forced me to postpone its completion. I hope you'll feel the remaining portion was worth the wait.<br><br>Steve Burke<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br>I dunno about all of you, but I think it's better that Steve work on completing the quests when he's got more time to do it right. I can't express to you how much work this guy puts into making these things work. But it's a lot.<br><br>Alan</UL>

The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000311.html">Scaled Wolves</a> was one of the latest updates to be made on the Developer's Corner today.  The original question and Absor's response is included in the following text:<UL>Aegwyn wrote:<br><br><b>Please bear with the story or skip to the end for my suggestion/question.<br>Growing up in Cabilis I had never seen a furry animal except one that came across my dinner plate. Then when I began my Shaman training I saw my masters summoning wolves, yet these weren't the wolves I hunted almost daily to supply Klok Mugruk with scales for armor. These wolves had fur and were soft. I was naive enough to ask one of the Shamans why he couldn't summon a wolf native to our lands, I was backhanded for my questioning of a superior but I believed at the time it was more because he was not powerful enough to summon one of the greater scaled wolves of Kunark. But now that I have increased my abilities beyond many of my former teachers I find I am unable to summon a wolf more suited to Iksars. I have talked to the Scaled Heirophants in the temple in Cabilis and even travelled to the great Plane of Cazic Thule, its only called Fear by those who have reason to be afraid, to seek audience with the great one himself. I have yet to recieve an answer to my questions on this subject.<br><br>Is there anyway to make it possible for Iksar Shaman to summon a wolf that has the look of the Scaled Wolves well known in Kunark?</b><br><br>I've heard a similar request from folks that play Iksar Necromancers. They would like to see their pets look like the Iksar skeletons that we see on Kunark.<br><br>Unfortunately, in order to allow such a pet to be summoned by those spells we would have to make those models available in all zones. This would mean adding them to the 'global' graphics file. Right now this file is pretty much as large as it can get, and we can't add anything to it.<br><br>Obviously we'll probably be doing something to accommodate new graphics for Shadows of Luclin. How that will affect our ability to add those (and other) graphics isn't really clear right now.<br><br>In short, try asking me again after the start of next year and I'll see if we have a different answer for you.<br><br>Alan</UL>

I don't get a confirmation box or anything (which I think was the bug when the corpse looting changes were originally introduced) I just get yellow text in my chat-box.<br><br>If it is an intentional change is the a command line switch to turn off that particular message display?</b><br><br>Yes, that's a bug. For some reason the game was sending you a meaningless message when you loot no-drop items.
