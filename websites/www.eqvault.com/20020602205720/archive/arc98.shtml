<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
An interesting situation has been developing over the weekend on the Gameplay Board.  It was called to my attention today by the following post Gordon Wrinn just made:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>The post by "Habenera", titled "Exposed- The Real Facts" was deleted because it purported to contain confidential and proprietary personnel information in regards to the EverQuest Guide Program. While I cannot comment on the authenticity or lack thereof in regards to the posted information, it is not appropriate for us to allow true or manufactured information of that type to be passed on to the public as "fact". <br><br>That said, the original poster of that message, "Habenera", does not speak for and is not affiliated with Verant Interactive or the EverQuest Guide program. I do indeed apologize to anyone subjected to the rantings of this individual. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Upon further investigation I discovered this was linked with a post Gordon Wrinn made last week asking a former guide named "rpgadvocate" to personally email him.  Rpgadvocate made his response public and you can <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053028.html">read it by clicking here</a>.  I have come to the conclusion that the reason Gordon asked him to email him was to deal with his views of the GM/Guide system in private.<br><br>A few minutes later someone, presumably from the guide program, posted rpgadvocate's personal file, which was the force behind the post Gordon made.  Yes, we know that post was been published on other sites and boards but I will <b>not</b> be posting it here. (so please don't email me asking for a link to it)<br><br>To cap things off <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net/">Lum the Mad</a> obtained the following response rpgadvocate posted:<BLOCKQUOTE>This is entirely too scary. Let me explain:<br><br>&#8226; Those records are accurate. I was ejected from the program the first week in February. One thing he has wrong however is that I was indeed asked to resign, but I refused on principle.<br><br>&#8226; So what this must mean is that a Verant employee who has access to database edits posted a portion of those records here, SERIOUSLY violating privacy policies. Verant needs to find out who the rogue poster is and fire him or her.<br><br>&#8226; About my attitude. Yes, I expressed my frustration to players on many occasions, telling them that while I believed many of their stories, I was powerless to do anything, and that they should /feedback, post, and generally make noise about poor policies. As for the guide messageboard, I did post a couple of vicious flames, but I believe I was justified in doing so, considering the abuse issues I was posting about. When I say "vicious" I mean scathing arguments, not childish prattle (except in one case, for which I apologized later).<br><br>&#8226; I was very lenient with everyone except those whom I actually witnessed multi-KSing, multi-training, and whatnot. I was stern with those folk, as there was nothing I could do officially, since the PNP wasn't in force at the time.<br>Both these attitudes caused me trouble in the program, as being a policy-bot is the only acceptable way to act. <br><br>&#8226; So does that mean my Guiding was impeccable? OF COURSE NOT!! One night I acted like a complete ass, as I had had a bad day. Guess what I spent the first 20 minutes of my shift doing the next day? You guessed it! APOLOGIZING to everyone that was online that I was short and rude to the previous evening. GMs need to own up to trouble like that.<br><br>&#8226; Finally, you made my argument more powerful than I ever could have. This foul deed is exactly the kind of abuse that I allege is routine within Verant.</BLOCKQUOTE>We'll bring you any updates (depending on their importantance and relevance) concerning this situation as they occur.

Also new the Editorial section is another article written by Oakgrove Fallingleaf.  This one, entitled <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid961380015,57564,">Quit Yer Whinin'</a>, deals with evil race factions in Kunark.  Here's a clip: <UL><i>In fact, I see the complexity of the factions on Kunark to be colorful<br>obstacles to be overcome by those who are the most ingenious. Further,<br>I would not characterize Kunark as a region in which high-levels should<br>concentrate on levelling quickly - much of what is there is to provide a<br>variety of challenges rather than the ability to race through levels. <br>Moreso, I was glad to see the experience lowered for monsters of the<br>same caliber elsewhere in order to slow level advancement and<br>concentrate on the environment and thrill of the game.</i></UL>Thank Oakgrove!

This article helps those particularly new to EQ, or misinformed, learn a little about how the GM/Guide system works.

The topics of linkdeath and PvP where the issues recently addressed by Sony's Gordon Wrinn.  The following contains excerpts from the original post along with Gordon's entire response:<UL>Its always bugged me that when you go link dead everyone in the zone can see that your link dead. What is the point of this? the only people that need to know are the people in your group, NOT everyone in the zone. If you dont play on the PVP servers then its no big deal, but if you do its so unfair. You go link dead, you log back on only to find out that you got pked, lost an item and you have no idea who killed you. The really sad thing is the last time i was pked from a LD, the guy that killed me was 4 levels below me. <br><br><b><i>I do wonder if the benefit to be obtained by removing the linkdead notation in the /who list is less than that that would be lost. If people in your group miss the message, they can always check the /who list. If people who are not in your group are talking to you, they can /who and see that you are LD and not just ignoring them. I really doubt that the linkdead-PK issues happen enough to be a concern. As long as people cannot force others to go LD, they shouldn't be able to reliably hunt LD players.</b></i><br><br>LD players (casters) should be casting spells to the best of there abilities. <br><br><b><i>Since LD players are NPCs in most cases, and since NPCs follow different rules on what they can and cannot cast, players casting created a number of problems where people would mem spells that they can't cast in a particular area and go LD on purpose. </b></i><br><br>Remove the text message that tells everyone in the zone that you went LD.<br><br><b><i>See above.</b></i><br><br>If you go LD BEFORE you get attacked, nobody can loot you. If i cant tell who killed me then nobody should be allowed to loot me.<br><br><b><i>I don't believe that the information relating to when you were attacked versus when you went LD is available at the time of the kill. All that's known is that you were attacked and that you are now dead. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

A case of "insane GM behavior" was reported on the Gameplay Board recently.  Here's the original post followed by Gordon's response:<UL>I allowed my friend to play with my lvl 20 woodelf warrior. Big mistake.<br>The kunark boats were down, so he was summoned to firiona by GMs, then wandered off into the forest to be slaughtered by Drachnids and Drolvarg. Naturally his bind point was in Faydark.<br><br><br>I came and took over at this point. I asked if the GMs could summon me back (once he got to the BB docks). Nope, the boats were back up. So I waited half an hour and took the boats. I proceeded to tell the GM i was in contact with what had happened and the terrible situation my corpse was in. He said: I will summon the corpse to a safe location.<br><br>Beginning of insane GM behavior: he would not tell me the location he summoned the corpse to. By the time I got to firiona I still couldnt pry it out of him. I wasnt asking for a rezz...I was asking where he put my corpse! At least I KNEW where it was before, even if it was surrounded by Drachnids. The GM keeps giving me the standard "sorry I cant help you with this".<br>I didnt have any money in the bank (it was all on my corpse) so I had to sell some of my more expensive items to merchants so that I could get a Chipped Bone Rod from Firiona merchants (no bards to be had and no necro would go to firiona vie). I used a couple of the prescious charges to determine that the 'safe location' was somewhere thru that nest of Drolvarg thingies...deep reds.<br><br>It's been 2 hours since I died. I'm getting tired of this. I tell the GM to just put the corpse back where he found it. You know what? HE WOULDNT EVEN DO THAT. He basically screwed me over and then wouldnt undo it even when it was obvious that it had hurt more than helped.<br><br>For the next 2 hours I just begged people to tell me if they saw the corpse or if they could escort me out to where I thought it was. So there I was, naked lvl 20 woodelf warrior, strolling around aggro reds with no guards in sight. Well, somebody finds the corpse...I somehow get back to Firiona unscathed...get the corpse...all is well, nothing but a little exp loss.<br><br>Abashi, can you justify the 4-hour corpse-juggling this GM put me thru? (i dont have the gms name atm, I will get it asap and post it)<br><br><b><i>I really don't know why the GM even got involved with this situation to begin with. You let someone else play your character (which, for future reference is not allowed by the EULA), and that person got it in a rough spot. The GMs certainly aren't there to save people from their own bad decisions, but to assist when things that shouldn't happen do.<br><br>That said, if a CS rep made the mistake to get involved in the first place, moving the corpse and not telling you where it was was worse of a mistake than carrying the corpse to you would have been, so please accept my apologies.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon responded to a post claiming that some JBoots are rigged to blow.  Here's the original post followed by Gordon's response:<UL>Be on the lookout for exploding Jboots.<br><br>I (level 50 Necro) was in the process of redoing the shadowbound quests (had just given my robe, gloves and boots to my wifes Necro) and had gathered all the quest components with the exception of the Shadowed Man items. Normally I have hunted them in South Karana, but this time, for convenience sake, I was going to kill them in Lavastorm. After killing a couple, I decided to scout for a new location with better visibility. I found such a location, parked my pet, and right clicked on my jboots in preparation for going up the hill the to pull a shadowed man. The second I clicked upon my jboots BANG! Dead. I checked the scrollback when I reappeared at my bind point and the only lines which appeared were Your feet feel quick (or whatever the Jboots line is) immediately followed by Loading Please Wait...<br>No non melee falling damage, no NPC spell casting, etc. Only instantaneous damage of over 900hps the second I clicked on my boots.<br><br>Of course I petitioned and of course was told politely by a guide that there was nothing that they could do about it, etc, etc. I decided to camp at my bind point at that point instead of making the trudge back to my body.<br><br>I myself am going to take a couple of weeks off to decide if it's worth playing again. I definately do not expect Verant to believe every single player of this game when they die due to suspicous reasons - that's not the point. What the point IS however is that in a codebase as large as EQ must be, along with a host of other things that could cause illogical deaths it sucks to be the first or the second or third to die due to a bug (or in some cases many more) since instantly you are branded a liar and seen as trying to scam the system.<br><br>In 50 levels my Necro has died countless times. Same goes for my 40 Druid, 21 Warrior, and all the rest of my EQ toons. Only three times have I petitioned. Once to report a trade bug (and I stated in the petition that I didn't expect anything to be done, I was simply reporting it), a second time when someone was being overly profane in ooc, and this, the third time. You'd have thought if I was trying to "scam the system" I wouldn't have waited till I had well over 100 levels of playtime under my belt.<br><br>Ah well, just a warning to everyone who's got em. Be carefull when clicking on your Jboots. When I asked if I should continue to use my Jboots I was told that if I didn't want to risk another death, I would probably be better off not using them. If you aren't prepared to pay with your EQ life and a healthy chunk of xp, you probably should bank your Jboots for a while.<br><br><b><i>I've never heard of this happening before. It's certainly not something that we put in intentionally. I would encourage anyone experiencing this to /report it and then /petition a gm. <br><br>If anyone else has had this happen I'd like to hear about it.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Brad McQuaid was on the boards today answering a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052361-2.html">post concerning the clipping plane</a> issue.  Here's the original post followed by Brad's response:<UL>I've been saying for MONTHS that the clipping plane slider bar is bugged. But Verant has yet to fix it. They say they have moved out the file header to max on the server, but since this is a client side bug, its still not fixed. I finnally got fed up at being believed by everyone BUT Verant, so I took the time to makes these pictures.<br>As you can see, as the rain subsites, it moves off, reveiling the real max clipping plane, but when the rain actually stops, the haze sets in, breaking the clipping planes max distance.<br>Abashi said that the clipping plane on each zone was set to max. Well if it was set to max, why is the rain able to go farther out then we are able to see? <br>I also made a comparison picture so you could see the difference.<br>----------------------------------<br><br>Here we have a normal day of EQ (typhoon)<br><br><a href="http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRaining.jpg">http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRaining.jpg</a><br><br>----------------------------------<br><br>Here we have the rain moving off, and as you can see, it reveils a lot of open land. This wasn't even the farthest it goes, but its hard to take a pic at the right time when you only have 2 seconds.<br><br><a href="http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRainStopping.jpg">http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRainStopping.jpg</a><br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>Here is what we normally see. Lots of sky, not much land. The above might not look like a lot of extra land, but when you take the time to study it, you can see that it really can ammount to a LOT of extra distance.<br><br><a href="http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRainStopped.jpg">http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRainStopped.jpg</a><br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>Here is a comparison of the 2 views. I didn't want to confuse anyone and have them say that "They can't see the difference"<br><br><a href="http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereCompare.jpg">http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereCompare.jpg</a><br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>Any Questions?<br><br><b><i>First, thanks for the screenshots -- it helped us understand part of this issue.<br>Jeff Butler and I looked into this personally today and came to some conclusions.<br><br>But first, some info into how clipping planes work.<br><br>1. When an outdoor zone is exported from the tools we use to create it, the artist chooses a maximum clip plane. This setting affects how far out visibility is calculated, and can affect file size and frame rate.<br><br>2. Most old world zones were exported with a much lower number than most Kunark zones.<br><br>3. Each zone has a minimum and maximum clip plane number associated with it server side. These are the numbers you move between when you adjust the clipping plane slider in-game.<br><br>4. The slider bar is supposed to work as a percentage. In other words, in one zone if the min is 1 and the max 1000, were the slider in the center, you'd be at 500. But if the min was 1 and the max 100, say for another zone, you'd be at 50 with the slider in the middle.<br><br>Ok, so, after looking into this and checking out the screenshots referred to in this thread we were able to determine the following:<br><br>1. For some reason (we'll ask the programmer tomorrow), when rain stops, the clipping plane moves out beyond the max briefly and then settles back at the max. For example, I went to Overthere and verified what the screenshots showed: the Overthere's max clip is 1800 feet. It looked like the clip went to 2000 or so briefly when the sky was still gray and then returned to 1800 when the sky was on again.<br><br>2. Another bug (though not terribly consequential) is that depending on the max clip, the clip slider bar appears to do nothing the last 25% or so. I was in the Overthere using the clip slider and watching the clipping plane distance in feet (something that doesn't show on the normal client) and it got to the max, 1800, at around 75% of the slider bar.<br><br>Ok, so what does this all mean? And could people see farther in the past?<br><br>Possibly, yes -- we've changed the max clipping plane in zones several times. The fact that the slider bar appears to max out early, though, isn't stopping you from setting your clipping plane to the max setting server side. Neither is the rain.<br><br>A good question, though, is 'if the Overthere displays out to 2000 briefly, why isn't the max clip for the Overthere 2000?'<br><br>I agree. What we'll do is go through the zones again and make sure the max server side is really the max the zone was exported at.<br><br>Do keep this in mind, though: we cannot move the max clip beyond the clipping distance the zone was originally exported at -- the visibility data is just not there and you'll see nothing beyond that hard limit. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the old world zones had max clips between 600 and 1500 feet. In other words, East Commons will never have a clip of 1800 or 2000 like the Overthere could.<br><br>I'll also ask that the bug associated with the rain that has the cilp pull back past the max clip be fixed, although honestly, it's not going to be a high priority bug in that it doesn't hurt gameplay.<br><br>Anyway, I hope this clears things up. I'll watch this thread tonight to see if there are any additional questions.<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>Here's the second volley of posts in this thread:<UL>Brad I took a screenshot of each click of the clipping plane slider, from left to right, and took a snapshot of it (you can see its position)<br>I wanted to upload the images but seems @home won't let me upload at the momment... *sigh*<br>I also included a picture from the front of Felwithe that shows the entrace to the city, but the horizon is mostly sky, cause the clipping plane can't go far enough. Before the bug, I used to be able to see a good chunk of the town and NO blue sky at the horizon.<br>Since my server is down, would you like me to zip them up and email them to you?<br><br><b><i>Darkmatter: The slider works fine up until that 75% or so point -- I was watching both the display that showed what the clipping distance is in feet as well as the view in the 3D window.<br>Am I positive that when it says 1800 feet I'm really seeing 1800 feet? *shrug* As much as I can be -- the number is really just relative ('virtual' feet).<br><br>Is it possible that when some weather/fog bugs were looked at that all zones clips were reduced a percentage, but I doubt it. I will ask the programmer to look at that again.<br><br>I really think that having the live team go through and make sure the max_clip is set to as far as one can physically see in the zone (based on the exported zone maximum) is the best solution. Then, as long as you can move the slider to the right and eventually your client's clip is the same as the maximum clip for the zone, everything should be fine.<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>And here's the third and final volley of posts:<UL>Oh while I was watching the rain for 30 minutes while I was making my first set of screenshots I had an idea.<br>Instead of having superlow visibility for all rain, why not have it random.<br><br>Rainstorms aren't always hurricanes.<br><br>You could have it randomly pick how far the clipping plane is brought in, and how hazy it is, and if there was lightning, so you could reproduce a light shower.<br>You could also alter the ammount of light coming in, and the actual rain grafics so it could be raining more, or less. Maybe even at an angle to represent the wind blowing it. Rain should also be seen farther out in the distance, as it is now, the rain is almost totally 2D. (Actually I think it IS 2D. :P)<br><br>And, a cool thing, would be rarely, a really BAD storm where visibility was done to near 0, and rain came down hard, and light was really reduced. But this would have to be really rare or would kinda hamper the gameplay.<br><br>Obviously not a high priority issue but I think it would add to the game. <br><br><b><i>Darkmatter:<br>When I move the slider bar (or hit the + key) it tells me something like: current clip: 500 max clip: 1800. Then, when I move it to about 75% it tells me current 1800 and max 1800 and then it stays at that from 75% to 100%. (which is obviously a bug -- the slider reads 75% but is really at 100%).<br><br>When the max_clips are moved up on Test we will tell you. I will also ask the client programmer to let all players know current and max clip values (like our special client tells us now).<br><br>Your rain ideas are great, and we could possibly randomize the fog distance when raining a little, but not much. The rain drops in EQ are actually polygonal particles, and if you could see very far while it rained your frame rate would approach zero because of all the particles that would be drawn :(<br><br>-Brad</i></b></UL>

As usual, Gordon was once again on the Gameplay Board answering people's questions and responding to comments.  Here's the latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052852.html"><b>Rare Spawn Complaints</b></a><br>Most of the complaints I see in regards to these rare spawns for quest components is related to the general feeling that there is an "entitlement" to these items. There isn't. No one is entitled to any particular item. <br><br>You can't fix a situation where everyone is camping by making what they are camping for more plentiful. That just encourages camping, as the camp duration gets shorter, and more people feeel that the camp time is worth the effort. As it is now, maybe people will get the idea that the camp is too long, and just choose not to camp. Then perhaps someone happening by can get lucky and find the spawn in question. If people are still choosing to camp it, perhaps we need to look into making it even rarer, closing the quest, or look into creating other items that represent reasonable alternatives to the item that people are choosing to camp.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052874.html"><b>EverQuest & FPS Games</b></a><br>I completely agree that Doom and other First-person shooter type games are very fun, despite the lack of a penalty for death. However, those games are not about building and molding a character to your desires. The worlds aren't persistent. There's is nothing that can be achieved by playing for a year that can't be achieved in the first few minutes of each life. <br><br>The games are completely different and cannot be measured against each other. The concept of "Challenge" is implemented in different ways. EverQuest implements challenge by providing risks. In order to provide risks, there must be some downside that will be realised should a task not be completed. That downside can't be enjoyable, or it wouldn't be a risk. <br><br>I do wish that I could explain this to everyone's satisfaction. If anyone can offer any suggestions to this end, I'd certainly appreciate it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052875.html"><b>Gaining Experience</b></a><br>Experience given by a creature is based upon its level, and the zone you are in. It is not based upon its level in relation to you, other than at the point that you stop receiving experience from killing a particular level creature. <br><br>In other words, if you are level 50, a level 49 creature will give more experience than a level 48 creature, even though they are both blue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052873.html"><b>Online Store Status</b></a><br>The status is that the online store in it's former incarnation will probably not be up in the foreseeable future. We are however working on a web-based store that we expect to open in a few weeks.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052845.html"><b>Spell Drops</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I have yet to see a difference in the spell drop rate. Hours of hunting skyfire, chardok, etc. still yield nothing]</i> <br><br>Most people who cite problems with spell drops cite hours of hunting in Skyfire and Chardok. Consider for a moment that though spells drop there, those might not be the best places to find spells.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052735.html"><b>The Bammbo Bo Stick</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: We were told by you Abashi that the Bammbo Bo stick was a mistake and was being lowered in weight.]</i> <br><br>Actually I never said that. I said that some of the monk-only weapons in Kunark were too heavy, and I never meantioned what specific weapons. Anyway, the live team went through the weapons and lowered the weight on some of them. Some of them are remaining rather heavy, and are that way on purpose. <br><br>I'll ask the live team to look it over again, but I wouldn't expect a ton of dramatic changes. The fact that a particular character has the ability to use a particular weapon doesn't necessarily mean that they *should* use it, nor that it's the *best* thing that they could be using. <br><br>Wait until you see some of the cursed items that will begin turning up soon.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052614.html"><b>Account Hacking</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon this must be fixed(account hackers) Now this is an ongoing problem and need to be addressed instantly!]</i> <br><br>I would love to be able to find out how this stuff happens. In most cases, we can usually track it back to passwords being given by the account owners to guild members or real-life "friends". In most other cases, it turns out to be some auction or account sales related fraud. <br><br>Players have to be responsible for their own account information and never provide it to anyone. They also need to refrain from buying characters online as the original owner can get the account back at nearly any time. We'll of course ban the account in the case of the latter, but we don't at all get involved with any lost funds. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Set up direct link command just like bug or feedback and have it go directly to all gms guides and customer support peeps online so that the peeps hacking are caught in the act!]</i> <br><br>Very few people could get caught hacking in the act as most people don't have multiple accounts to log in and see it for themselves. That said, some type of more direct system-wide petition would probably end up being used for things other than hacking. <br><br>All of that said, I would like to hear from folks who've had their accounts hacked, and honestly never gave the password to anyone and never bought or sold the account.

I received the following notice from VanZant:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings All,<br><br>On Thursday, May 15th, the Crimson Dragons guild on Fennin Ro hosted their<br>1st Annual Newbie Gnome Race.  The Race was started at the entrance to the<br>city of Ak'Anon and ended at the gates of Halas.  Over twenty-five members<br>of the Crimson Dragons guild created 1st level gnome characters of any class<br>and raced this tremendous distance.  None of the racers were allowed to use<br>any type of speed increasing buffs or buffs such as invisibility and<br>levitate that help to avoid creatures.  Teleports were not allowed, nor were<br>high level escorts.  Binding in cities along the way was permitted.<br><br>After the start at Ak'Anon, the stampede of newbie gnomes rushed through<br>Faydwer and boarded the ship at the docks in Butcherblock.  After much<br>singing, merriment and the spreading of sheer terror to the Ocean of Tears<br>population, the gnomish hordes spilled out onto the Freeport Docks and began<br>their frenzied rush to Halas.  Out of twenty-fave racers, only five gnomes<br>were able to complete the extremely difficult course.  Kilkin Cobblepot came<br>in first place, followed shortly by Taldor Fizzalot and Tahnlu Freestyler in<br>second and third.  The three victorious gnomes were awarded several flasks<br>of brandy and graciously drank themselves into unconciousness on the Halas<br>pier!<br><br>Congrats to all racers for an extremely amusing event!  Please feel free to<br>visit the Crimson Dragons website at <a href="http://www.crimson-dragons.com">http://www.crimson-dragons.com</a> for<br>pictures and details about the event!<br><br>Take Care,<br>VanZant BraveSword<br>Warrior of the 50th Season<br>Crimson Dragons Guild Leader</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks VanZant!

The following news post contains two observations about the patch that was recently implemented.  Here's the first report:<BLOCKQUOTE>The casting time for Donal's Arms of Mourning (effect: Valor) was doubled, to 12 seconds. Verant "forgot" to mention this in the patch info today. I thought is was important to know.

They are now Half the old price.<br><br>For example where it used to cost 10p5g to make a sow potion it now costs 4p2g5s. All herbs in FV were cut in half but this is as far as I could check will be checking on rest tonight.<br><br>Katerin soon to be wife of Acidic Maarr<br>Level 51 Divine Shaman</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks guys!

Another very positive <a href="http://www.electricgames.com/reviews/e/everquestrok.html">review of Kunark</a> was posted at Electric Games.  The final score awarded to RoK is 4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars.  Here's the bottom line:<UL>The Ruins of Kunark adds about 33% more land content to Everquest, a new playable race, the ability to achieve character levels above the previous limit, and a ton of new spells, monsters, items, and quests. The graphics in the new zones are incredibly detailed and show off all new effects. The expansion is more difficult than the original game, but still worth a look by new customers. 200,000+ subscribed players (even though a minority of them complain very loudly) is an impressive number and shows how addictive this game can be. </UL>Thanks RHFactor!

As promised, here is the second part of today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052536.html"><b>Explain ATK and AC x/1000 Caps</b></a><br>Numbers over 1000 are indeed calculated. <br><br>Back in beta, for a time, AC and ATK were displayed with two numbers each, showing the different components of the factor. For instance, AC was displayed with both a damage avoidance and a damage mitigation factor. This was highly confusing to a majority of the players, so both numbers were combined for the purpose of display. <br><br>Basically, the two numbers were added, then divided by a theoretical max that one could attain at the time, yielding a percentage. It's this percentage that is displayed. <br><br>Now, when we brought new items into the game that raised the true theoretical max (as opposed to the calculated theoretical max), and espicially when we brought out Kunark, we could have raised the calculated theoretical max so that the percentage would always be below 1000, but that would have resulted in most people seeing their AC drop, making them think that we had somehow nerfed it. So we left the calculated max the same, yeilding numbers greater than 1000. <br><br>For actual combat calculations, the values you see are still reduced into their specific componenets which aren't capped with exception of lower level twinking-impact caps that we've referenced before.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052577.html"><b>Speed Advantage</b></a><br>Well with any internet-based game, a better connection never hurts. However EQ is designed to mask some of the typical problems experienced by slower connections. For instance, some games won't allow you to move unless packets are flowing. EQ does, and sync's up with the server regularly to see that you aren't doing something illegal. <br><br>The biggest difference experienced is usually the time it takes to zone. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052579.html"><b>Server Population Cap</b></a><br>As I've mentioned before, capping server population is not something that we consider to be a valid option, and certainly wouldn't help retain players. People would get upset and leave if they suddenly found themselves unable to play that character that they have months of playtime invested in. It would be an all-too-regular occurence if server population were capped. <br><br>Also, people new to the game often have friends that already play. We'd be shooting ourselves in the foot if we just told all of these new players that they couldn't play with their friends. <br><br>As for your assertions on what would be fixed: <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Camping would be lessened]</i> <br><br>No, it wouldn't. People still camp on the test server which only has about 500 people on it at peak. They camp because its an easier and preferred method to get experience and loot. What there *would* be is less people waiting to join a particular camp. We're always working on this issue by trying to get people to spread out, moving loot around, randomizing drops, etc. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Class envy would be less because competition would be less.]</i> <br><br>Class-envy will exist as long as some class can do something that another class can't. It's not related to competition for most. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Finding groups would be easier]</i> <br><br>Actually we've found that smaller populations have more problems finding groups than larger ones. With more people on the server, there are more groups, and thus more groups that aren't full, leading to more groups that need people. <br><br>Servers with smaller populations (PvP servers, Test) often have people who cite problems finding groups, as well as problems getting services such as binding or resurrections during off-peak times. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Economy would not be as screwed up]</i> <br><br>The economy being "screwed up" is subjective. Trading among people happens very frequently on the servers. Signs of a screwed up economy in a game of this nature are indicated by a lack of demand, due to an excess of supply, or vice versa. Either the items are too valuable to trade, or they are too worthless to be traded. <br><br>Since people are constantly trading items, the economy isn't "screwed up". <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: People would be able to play and enjoy themselves and when the can actually play, they will tend to dwell less on the things they *cant* do, and the things they *cant* get.]</i> <br><br>That's based upon the personal psyche and choice of each player.

Here's part 1 of today's edition of the Gordon Infobits.  Part 2 will be posted in a few minutes.  Here's the first part:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052452.html"><b>Coin-Loot News</b></a><br>We're actually considering a "magic coin purse" that will reduce the weight of coin carried. No promises on this yet as it's still a work in progress. <br><br>That said, we're going to revisit coin-loot in Kunark in Monday's tuning meeting.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052485.html"><b>Customer Support Helping Retrieve Corpses</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I am curious, what bad aspects are there in helping me find my corpse?]</i> <br><br>Guides and GMs will not provide services that a player can provide, except in the cases of a bug. <br><br>Corpse recovery, in this case, is an intended part of the game. The Guide probably went to your corpse, found it in an open and accessible area, and then determined that he couldn't help you.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052492.html"><b>/ignore & Spells</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I am a lvl 50 wizard on the Prexus server and I got my Temp Flux Staff at level 20, for 30 levels I have used it as a pulling and distance gauge. To suddenly change it as a quick fix to a "so called" spam problem is totally unfair. A better fix would be to make the /ignore work with spell effects...]</i> <br><br>/ignore does work on spell effects, but not affects upon YOU. In other words, you won't see "IgnoredPerson begins to cast a spell", but you will see "You feel friendly", because it is an effect upon you. <br><br>At the point that you are feeling the effects of the spell, the game doesn't know who cast it. Changing the game on a broad scale to include that information for the sake of two items really wouldn't be a good use of time. <br><br>I do apologize to everyone affected by the casting times.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052431.html"><b>Caster Spellbook</b></a><br>Though I appreciate the effort to form an argument and draw a parallel between the two issues, looking at a spellbook and being able to bind anywhere aren't related. <br><br>Melee bind is an issue of balance and class-interdependence, whereas a caster looking at a spellbook is one of fun and aesthetics.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052356.html"><b>Post 50 Hybrid Spell Bug?</b></a><br>It's not a bug, but rather it is based upon the level that you get the spell in question. Since hybrids get the spells post-50, they are treated like level 50+ spells of other classes. <br><br>That said, I will talk to the tuning team to see if we can get it based on the lowest level that anyone gets the spell.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052178.html"><b>Complaint against a GM</b></a><br>I am indeed sorry that you feel that you were treated badly in this manner, however, the GM was correct in that linkdeath, often being something out of our control, is not a "bug" and therefore wouldn't result in a GM resurrection. <br><br>Of course, if we have a zone that goes down or our ISP has a problem, we make every effort to perform resurrections for people who died at the time. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052053.html"><b>Kunark Monsters are Disappearing</b></a><br>That's not a pathing problem, but one associated to the size of the zones and the number of NPCs in them. We're working on this issue now.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052048.html"><b>Will Bertoxxulous be split again?</b></a><br>We're planning on addressing issues with several servers in the near future. We have a new server on order currently, and will probably split Karana and Bertox to it. MithMarr and a couple of others are being looked at as well, but will probably be split to one of the existing underutilized split servers.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052041.html"><b>Balance Comments</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Warriors are Offensivly WEAK]</i> <br><br>I disagree that they are "Weak". They rank third in overall melee damage, with rogues and monks trading places for the number 1 spot depending on circumstances. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Warriors are Defensivly AVERAGE]</i> <br><br>I disagree here as well, and would rank them defensively "High". Their ability to have much higher AC and Hitpoints than any other class gives them some serious advantages in the defensive department. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Warriors have higher downtime than ANY class.]</i> <br><br>Only if they don't have healer support. If they do, which they always should, their downtime is no more than that of the healer/buffer supporting them. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Warriors are the most dependant on healing classes.]</i> <br><br>I'll buy that. Of course, I've never met a healer who didn't like warriors either. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: As a 54 Warrior I see the ONLY place that warriors are "powerful" is in groups, and while we are better than other classes in that aspect we are NO WHERE near as balanced in the solo/small group aspects that make the "balance" of Versatility playable.]</i> <br><br>This is as intended. Warriors weren't designed for solo play, so weren't "balanced" in that respect. A warrior is always expected to be in a group of some kind.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052029.html"><b>Are ATK and AC softcapped at 1000?</b></a><br>AC and ATK are derivatives of other values used to provide some general info to the person playing. They are not, in and of themselves, capped in any fashion.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052017.html"><b>Why can't Rogue's kick?</b></a><br>I think you've answered your own question. There's really no reason for them to have kick, when their existing special attack will almost always do more damage.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052070.html"><b>What happens if you are banned in month one of 6 prepaid months? </b></a><br>If banned, any time already paid on the account is forfeit.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045763-4.html"><b>Keyboards & International Users</b></a><br>We're going to be testing keyboard translations for international users on the Test server over the next week or two. Logging on to the test server will create a file named "Keyboard.txt" in your everquest directory. This file may be edited to put in alternate keyboard definitions. <br><br>Editing this file isn't exactly an easy task, but we're hoping that enough people will log on from the various areas to present us with alternate Keyboard.txt files that we can put up on the web page. <br><br>If any users of alternate standard keyboards would like to try their hand at editing the file, please give it a shot and test it out. Assuming everything works out, please email your modified Keyboard.txt file to jbutler@verant.com. <br><br>Here's a copy of the patch message that will be on the test server shortly: <br><br>---snip---<br><br>Today the testeqgame.exe file was updated to allow users to modify their keyboard layout in order to account for some international keyboards. When the executable launches, it will create a file in your EverQuest directory named &#8220;KEYBOARD.TXT&#8221;. You may modify this file using an ASCII text editor to substitute keys where appropriate. <br><br>The beginning of the file contains un-shifted keys, and the end contains the character that will be printed when the SHIFT key is depressed. Feel free to edit this file as you wish, but take care to leave any unprintable characters or spaces intact. If you make a mistake editing this file and have problems, merely delete the file. A new default version will be created the next time that testeqgame.exe is launched. <br><br>If you use a standardized keyboard layout other than QWERTY, such as the French AZERTY layout, we would be interested in seeing your version of the file. After you&#8217;ve modified and tested your version of the KEYBOARD.TXT file, please email it along with a description of what standard it is for to jbutler@verant.com. <br><br>---snip---<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051035.html"><b>Al'Kabor & Mana</b></a><br>The Al`Kabor spells are targetable "radiate out from target" type spells. In addition to this, they have the ability to affect more targets at once than any of the other AE spells. <br><br>That's why their mana/damage ratio might be a bit worse than other AE spells.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051158.html"><b>Pets & Power</b></a><br>Pets are indeed powerful, I don't think that we or anyone else will deny that. That said, I do not believe that the existence of these powerful pets reduces the need for or replaces melee classes. I've never seen someone /ooc for a group saying "Need warrior or Mage/Necro with pet". Perhaps that might happen once in a while for combat outdoors, but in dungeons, there's no substitute for the human intellect.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051506.html"><b>Twinking</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why is it that twinking is not considered a 3rd Party Program? Just as that rogue put zero effort into upping his skills, the newbie twink has put no effort into gaining his uber equipment. Although it is all done thru the game, it is still the same principle, is it not? Why is twinking allowed, but not using a macro to raise skills? Twinking raises AC, ATK, and often other stats.]</i> <br><br>It's a nice argument, but twinking is accounted for in the game design. We acknowleged that people would do it and put things in game to minimize any unbalancing impact from it. Not to mention, with twinking, *someone* had to put in the effort. Whether the fruits of that effort move around is up to the person who put in the effort. <br><br>Macroing doesn't compare to twinking. If an analogy was needed, I'd have to compare it to duping. In both cases, someone receives gains that were not earned by anyone. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Again: He wasn't playing HIMSELF. He let the pad play while he was off taking a nap or something. And THAT was the bannable offense.]</i> <br><br>That's an accurate observation.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051716.html"><b>Experience Res Time Limit</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: XP Res time limit should be 4 hours, due to Kunark]</i> <br><br>That's a good argument. I'll bring up your thoughts at the meeting next Monday. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051901.html"><b>Armor Comments</b></a><br>At first glace the AC makes sense since Druids are not meant to get the same level of armor as the other priest classes. As for the weight, I'll ask the Live guys to take a look.</UL>

The question of how many tabacco products you go through a night was raised recently on this <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052506.html">thread</a> on the Gameplay Board.  Here's Gordon's response:<UL><i>I smoked about 3 packs a day for a 4 month period between my last consulting gig and the time I started here at Verant.

Gordon Wrinn made the following post recently on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>A few days ago we sent out an email from opportunities@verant.com to a small group of EverQuest players. The email asked them to fill out a survey on the <a href="http://www.testing1234.com">http://www.testing1234.com</a> URL for MovieFly, Inc., a Sony subsidiary, for the purpose of selecting testers for some new broadband technology. I do want to stress that participation is completely voluntary, being for people who want to check out some really cool new technology for free.<br><br>Due to some recent email account scams that have turned up, several people have written to me asking for authentication. This email is authentic, and the survey on the web page that it asks you to go to does not ask for any account information. <br><br>As always, you can feel free to contact me at gwrinn@verant.com anytime should you have a question about the authenticity of any communications you receive from us.

Here's today's message following the patch that was implemented today:<UL>June 15th, 8:00am<br>-----------------<br> <br>*Patch Day*<br> <br>Hello everyone,<br> <br>Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on The Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future.  Even so, a number of changes and additions were made in today's patch.  Most of the changes are in regards to quests:<br> <br>- The "Fleshy Orb" quest has been completed<br>- We've received word that "Fabian" has been spotted somewhere on Norrath.<br>- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly.<br>- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<br>- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the Lost Circle.  <br> <br>A few items have also been changed this week:<br> <br>- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.<br>- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a short casting time associated with their activatable effect (See Below).<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when you log off (See Below.)<br> <br><br>*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*<br> <br>We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to "spam" other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to disconnect.  Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages caused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.  <br> <br>The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have to stand still to use them now.<br> <br>*Gunthak Harpoon*<br> <br>In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon "rentable", meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff.  Basically, one of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it must be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.  Unfortunately, the stats on this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical composition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in obtaining it.  <br> <br>For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the next time that you log out.  This is a retroactive change and will affect weapons already in possession.  We do apologize to those who acquired it within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon.<br> <br>*Chat / Login Process*<br><br>Due to the rapidly increasing number of people playing EverQuest, the Chat<br>and Login processes have been moved to more robust servers. This should<br>increase the capabilities of both servers and help alleviate the congestion<br>experienced by some during periods of high utilization.<br> <br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Alexisi!
