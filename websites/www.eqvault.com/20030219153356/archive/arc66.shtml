Pets have been a hot issue lately on EverQuest boards across the net.  In the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035388.html">following thread</a> Alan summarizes things up:<UL><i>Let me summarize, for convenience sake, the changes that we have made to pets over the course of the last few patches.<br><br>Pets wielding weapons will now proc with those weapons just as frequently as a player character with that weapon and the same stats. This has reduced the frequency of weapon procs from pets. To make this change we simply removed an artificial multiplier to pet proc chances, no stats or attributes were changed.<br><br>Pets wielding the Sword of Runes will proc with that sword as often as they do with any other procing weapon, but it will only proc against its intended target, summoned creatures.<br><br>Magician and necromancer pets (and because they use the same spells, shadowknight pets as well) now have the ability to duel wield without a weapon, if they are powerful enough. This will happen with some regularity with pets cast from 39th level (52nd for shadowknights) spells and above.<br><br>No other changes to the duel wielding ability of any other pets was changed.

I received the following from Fitten:<BLOCKQUOTE>Outdoor Dragon Hat Trick and Two (Three) Rathe Server Firsts!<br> <br>Last night Blades of Destiny on The Rathe were looking for something to do and ended up pulling a hat trick involving the three outdoor dragons in Kunark.  First stop was Severilous, who fell as usual.  Next, everyone flitted off to Skyfire to attempt Talendor.  Having been unsuccessful against Talendor a couple times in the past, we were going to give new tactics a try.  We met Talendor and laid him low for the first time on the server!  Buoyed by these two successes, everyone decided to run give Gorenaire a try -- surely our stars were aligned properly as evidenced by the success of this server first!  We regrouped quickly and met Gorenaire in Dreadlands for the first time since the day these three dragons were introduced into the game.  The first clash sent us packing but was a close fight.  We decided to quickly regroup and give it another go.  This second attempt was met with success!  Congrats to Blades of Destiny for pulling off all three outdoor dragons in one night, two of which were Rathe server firsts!!  These server firsts followed on the heals of the first killing of Silverwing in Veeshan's Peak on the Rathe by Blades of Destiny this past weekend!

Veeshan's Peak, considered by most to be the most difficult of all EQ's zones, has been defeated on two seperate servers recently.  Damodread sent in the first report for the Cazic-Thule server:<BLOCKQUOTE><s>Me and my guild, The Dark Vigilantes, cleared Veeshan's <br>Peak yesterday, taking out Silverwing, Hoshkar, Druushk, <br>Nexona, Xygox and Phara Dar.  We were actually quite <br>impressed with ourselves since we were able to clear it in <br>our first time in the zone.  This just proves that my <br>guildmates are some of the best EQ players around.  My <br>thanks goes out to all of them and the other players <br>invited on the raid (especially Dobbwin! thanks for saving <br>my butt!).  Here's a small list of the loot:<br><br>Garrison received a Sword of Rile<br>Ouden received that crappy Enchanters robe<br>Kakamar received a Flowing Water Katana<br>Zaben received Grey Suede Boots<br>Smashbash received Shield of the Elders<br><br>There were also many other loots but I don't remember who <br>received what.

I<br>remember how difficult the first dragon of the Ring of Scale was,<br>Silverwing. The mighty silver dragon that guards the halls of the dungeon<br>was a difficult challenge. Each new dragon faced by my band of adventurers<br>was a new and difficult challenge. From the grotesque Hoshkar and his<br>diseased ridden breath to Nexona with her acidic breath. Easily the most<br>difficult dungeon we have ever seen was now nearing its completion. The<br>previous five dragons had all met their makers, and while we were all weary<br>and tired, we pushed ourselves to our limit. We entered the door to Phara<br>Dar himself, the rumored avatar of Veeshan himself.<br><br>We sent our brave Necromancer Ronald down to tempt the dragon to fight, alas<br>Ronald did not survive the taunting. Phara Dar was enraged and charged into<br>our ranks. Her breath seared like wilfefire through our ranks, as warriors<br>and wizards alike writhed in agony. With battle cries in the air we attacked<br>the black beast. Time and again, Phara breathed into our ranks, as many of<br>my comrades fell down dead. As the dragon began to faulter, I cried out<br>excited to see victory within our grasp. Phara Dar did not look beaten<br>however and showed us her breath weapon was not her only weapon, and started<br>to incant a spell. Magically, torn wings began to nit back together and open<br>wounds stopped bleeding and closed before our eyes. At this moment, I<br>despaired that we would die that day. With our backs against the wall, and<br>defeat certain, a frenzy overtook us. We fought like berserkers and cast<br>magical spells with abandon. As my stregth fled from my arms, I knew we were<br>dead, and I closed my eyes and continued to hack away at the Dragon's torso.<br>Suddenly, the halls went quiet and I realized I was still alive. I opened my<br>eyes to see the Black Dragon dead at my feet. I looked into the eyes of the<br>few remaining survivors from our once mighty guild and laughed. Let it be<br>written, the Ring of Scale has been vanquished by the Legacy of Steel.<br><br>See the screenshots of the battles and the amazing treasure discovered at: <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com">http://www.legacyofsteel.com</a><br><br>Ariel<br>GM Legacy of Steel<br>The Nameless </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

In your second point you talk about the feeble guard not being able to kill Young Kodiaks&#8230; And yet, you find opponents of Young Kodiak danger level out in East or West Commons&#8230; <br><br>Yes, the gate guards are the 'newbie' guards for Nektulos. <br><br>And there are other guards that are hunted, take a look out in the Karanas. Head over to Steamfont&#8230; <br><br>I guess my question to you is, why does in matter that those guards are killed? Humans in Freeport have the same level of guard protection in the area that they fight in at that level. I guess I'm confused by your anger at this situation&#8230; <br><br>By the way, I agree about the Lavastorm thing.

Perhaps a bit over my head, intellectually&#8230; <br><br>I think it's wrong to imply that you can only do one or the other, either increase the power of the monsters OR decrease the power of player characters, if your goal is to make the game harder (and that's IF&#8230;). <br><br>The real world answer is that you do both as the situation requires. In the case of one bit of the picture being off, say an item or a spell that makes one class or character type or tactic too powerful, relatively, you obviously reduce the power of that item. If you want to make the world as a whole more difficult for the heroes in it, then you can do either, really. Obviously the preferable method is to increase the AI for the monsters, or find other clever ways to make them more powerful. <br><br>That being said, don't go overboard. If we do something that reduces the power of an item or spell or somesuch, it's done in consideration of the whole. I like to picture class balance as a sort of sea (ok, I've never pictured it that way until just now&#8230;). Waves are expected, even desirable. But when you see a tsunami, what do you do? Do you raise the ocean or lower the wave? Keep in mind that if you raise the ocean you'll drown the world&#8230; <br><br>I love bad analogies. :)</UL>

Gordon stopped by the Gameplay Board today to make a couple of posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035008.html"><b>Downtime Affecting Users Across World</b></a><br>After having addressed many times I wonder if I should keep trying or give up, but I'll give it another short: <br><br>EverQuest is played all over the world. ANY time that we take the servers down will be SOMEONE's primetime. We try to take them down when the fewest number of people will be affected, that will mean taking them down during off-peak time for the America's. <br><br>It's a matter of math. How can we affect the fewest number of people possible? If *peak* was at 4am my time and the low point were at 8pm, we'd take them down at 8pm even though it was primetime here. <br><br>I realize as an off-peak player you don't like this, any more than Americans who play during off-peak like it, but until peak time moves to a time other than the time it is, our scheduled patches will be in the general viscinity of when this one is taking place. I'm sorry, but there is really no other option that makes sense. I've seen people argue that we should stagger patch times so that it falls in someone elses peak every time, but that does not meet the goal of affecting the fewest number of people possible. <br><br>Now, that said, no spawn is "exactly 7 days", nor is it exactly "three days". Any spawn over two hours has a +/- modifier that adjusts its spawn time. That means that the seven day spawn could very well pop up anywhere from six to eight days after it was killed.<br>--<br>It's plus or minus a percentage of the total spawn delay. That means that a two-hour spawn would have a variation of minutes, whereas a 7 day spawn could very well have a variation of days days.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035118.html"><b>Enchanter Pets</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What we want to know now is this. Will enchanter pets be made to dual-wield automatically at the levels you mentioned, just as mage and necro, and shadowknight pets now do? ]</i></font><br><br>In a word: No. <br><br>The enchanter pets consist of a floating sword and shield.

A new message now appears on the EQ Patch Server:<UL>November 29th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Today's patch includes updates to the client to address some problems reported by people in regards to the DX7 update, as well as other gameplay issues:<br><br>- Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing faction with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum.  Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate direction.<br><br>- Random-effects on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the pet is a player character rather than an NPC.  The change last patch reduced them to a rate below player characters.  As part of this patch, target-specific random effects will only work if the target is the intended type.  For instance, a weapon that processes "Dismiss Summoned" will only "go off" on a summoned NPC instead of everything.  <br><br>- Added some code that should address if not eliminate a problem reported by people whereas the client would "freeze" for a second or two every few minutes.  For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or driver problems, this should address the issue.<br><br>- Made final positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards.  Included in these changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash while carrying it.  <br><br>- Fixed a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and attempting to get back in.<br><br>- Added some code to address reports from people who find exiting from the character-select screen back to the server-select screen rather slow when mip-mapping is enabled.  Most of this problem is due to routines in DX required to release resources consumed by mip-mapping and may not be addressable until the next version of DirectX is adopted.<br><br>- Changed customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the "NOKEY" setting instead of the "Backspace".  This means that you can now assign "Backspace" to a function in game.<br><br>- Corrected a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be played "rapid-fire" under some circumstances.  There is still a potential for this to happen with some other sounds that will be addressed in a patch in the near future.<br><br>- Corrected a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more difficult than intended after the server had been up for a while.<br><br>- Higher level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have the ability to dual-wield without being handed weapons.  The calculation used to determine whether or not this ability exists takes several things into account, but for the most part 39th level and above summons (higher for the Shadowknight) will have this ability.  It is possible that you could get a "good" 34th level pet that will, or a "bad" 39th level pet that will not have this ability. <br><br>- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant.  Abandon your mates, though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's tune.<br><br>- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed blunt skill.<br><br>Remember! Only a few days left until the launch of EverQuest: The Scars of Velious.  Reserve your copy at your local retailer today!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

A detailed report of a recent event on the Bertoxxulous server was sent to me today by Iuveniel:<BLOCKQUOTE>Today as we went about our business in the fair city<br>of Firiona Vie, a shout was heard throughout the area<br>proclaiming that the defenders of the city come forth<br>and speak with a man by the name of Danak Dhorentath. <br>Upon arriving at the stone bridge we glimpsed an Iksar<br>figure in the distance, away from the guards.  Curious<br>we went forth to his side and asked what business he<br>had demanding that we come to his call.  Unworried<br>about being surrounded by the Defenders of Firiona<br>Vie, he explained that he had cast a ritual that would<br>shield him from harm and that we would do best to<br>entertain his speech.<br><br>This Iksar, Danak Dhorentath, apparently is<br>responsible for the kidnapping of Firiona Vie and has<br>held her these past six months torturing her for the<br>information only she herself can give up.  Danak<br>talked of the staff that she carried, a blessed weapon<br>of Tunare, and how his necromancer friend Vahlai had<br>discovered a ritual to steal away the Elven Princess'<br>powers.  These powers would be given instead to<br>Vahlai, Danak, and the evil Iksar Venril Sathir.  He<br>spoke of power over all of Norrath and how one person<br>in attendance had the power to stop this ritual,<br>though he never alluded to who it may be except in<br>vague hints and cryptic words.<br><br>This person would be presented a chance at some point<br>to stop the ritual or else claim the power with Danak<br>and rule over Norrath.  The evil being also spoke of<br>Galeth and the Companions returning to the lands of<br>Kunark.  Only time shall tell what the future holds<br>for our world and if Firiona Vie shall be released!<br><br>/ooc This event was wonderfully played out.  The group<br>of people gathered was only 10-15 strong at first, but<br>then began to grow as word spread, although it never<br>exceeded 25.  The GM did a wonderful job of keeping<br>the story VERY interesting and entertaining and I for<br>one am happy that I was able to participate.  One<br>person did attempt to strike down Danak but quickly<br>met his demise.  VERY quickly!  I applaud everyone at<br>the event for doing such a wonderful job roleplaying<br>it out and hope to see you all on the next segment of<br>the tale!<br><br>Attached are some screenshots of the event.<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak3.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak4.jpg">Screenshot #4</a><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid975469781,16381,"><b>Event Log</b></a></UL><br>Iuveniel Woodspirit<br>54th Unkempt Druidess<br>Bertoxxulous Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

It's always been based on the level of the NPC and the zone you are in. <br><br>- No change was made to make people lose more experience on death. The only change to this that has occurred since release was when it was halved. <br><br>- No change was made to reduce the amount of loot entering the world on a global scale. <br><br>Now in regards to your suggestions regarding level based equipment, it was decided some time ago that EQ would not take that route. The FAQ has a pretty good explanation regarding this suggestion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: BTW this was not a bash or flame, I am just concerend, I've been playing EQ for erm what 3 years now, and this latest move SCARES me.]</i></font> <br><br>Well two and a half years at most if you were in the earliest beta phase, but I don't believe that the "latest move" that you spoke of above occurred.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034913.html"><b>Necro & Magician Damge Rates Against Green Frog</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What is wrong with this picture:<br>he never ran out of mana...<br>he resisted unresistable spells...<br>he never got hurt even with 2 50+ pets wailing on him due to lifetap...]</i></font> <br><br>Nothing really. He's not an NPC that we want to be killed. As for the "unresistable" spells, there are only a couple of truly unresistable spells in game, and they all belong to NPCs.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034727.html"><b>Patch Problems</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Still can't activate spells with the control key, like you could before the patch (<ctrl> + <number 1-8> )]</i></font> <br><br>The default key was changed to ALT. You can check it back to CTRL if you like by going into Options/Keyboard. <br><br><br>2. I've never heard of that one. It sounds like a problem with your video card or driver, perhaps the way it's handling mipmapping. Have you tried turning off mipmapping to see what happens? <br><br>3. The spell line eats mana gradually. When you ran out of mana it didn't wear off. It was a bug fix. Should it have been reported? Certainly, but it's still a bug fix.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034702.html"><b>Witch Hunts</b></a><br>I'm unaware of any case where someone found a ban to be "probably mistaken" yet did not reverse it.

"Oh yeah, one more thing. Why doesnt EQ put the maps of the citys in there guide when you buy the game??"]</i></font> <br><br>There are indeed maps of the playable cities in the manual released with the Kunark full-retail box, which I believe is the only thing on the shelves these days. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. "Its been 2 years and they still havn't made the game compatible with most sound cards (promissed June, '98 that there would be a new sound engine VERY Shortly, September '00 still no engine)" ]</i></font><br><br>First, the game never had a problem with "most" sound cards as suggested. Some people running under certain configurations (with the SBLive for instance) had problems, where as others had no problems of that nature though they used the same card. The vast majority of people (including myself on my home system which included an SBLive) never had any problems. <br><br>As to the new sound engine, it's in. It went in the same time as the DX7 update. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. On the new expansion coming out "Still havnt fixed some bugs from beta.. "]</i></font> <br><br>It wouldn't be proper to comment without a specific list of "bugs from beta" to know what you are getting at. Most issues that exist and have existed for that period of time are not bugs, but rather a waived design issues that will never be addressed due to various technology limitations (download size being chief among them). They are part of the game now, and we'll have to live with them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. "I love EQ so don't get me wrong. I play AC also and, I have to admit, am wondering why AC makes upgrades and increases land/monsters/spells/items/etc etc, for FREE and EQ makes you pay for them? Just wondering..." ]</i></font><br><br>They have their business plan and we have ours. We've added tons of new content (quests, items, spells, even zones) for "free" as well. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034717.html"><b>The Point of AFK</b></a><br>Sinneed's response was pretty concise. <br><br>Basically, there's no "pause" button in a persistant world, at least not ours. The only way we would implement a "safe AFK" would be if there was absolutely no in-game benefit to using it. That means that we'd have to make you blind and deaf as well as stopping any type of regeneration and skill-use countdowns. <br><br>At that rate, the question indeed becomes, why not just log off?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034469.html"><b>Magical Damage</b></a><br>This keeps coming up as an example, though I've addressed it before. <br><br>What does "magical damage" mean to you? To you does that mean that any spell that does damage available to a wizard of a certain level should do more damage than any other spell available to any other class of a particular level? <br><br>If so, that's not the definition we use. Our definition is damage over a time period. A DOT that does more damage overall than ICE comet does not do it in the short period of time like Ice Comet. Of those two spells you mentioned, one wizard and one mage, the wizard spell is faster and more mana efficient. <br><br>Wizard spells across the board have usually have either better casting times, better mana ratios, do more damage, or a combination of the three than those of any other class (harmtouch excluded) ***over a period of time***. That's how it works, and wizards fit that definition. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034695.html"><b>More Druid Forms Needed?</b></a><br>"Require" is a pretty strong word. While I understand that you *want* more forms, I don't think that they are required. As such, it's certainly good content for the wish-list, but it's not something that I can say we will or will not do at some point in the future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034622.html"><b>NPC Named "!"</b></a><br>The exclaimation point is indicative of an NPC that has been "permakilled", which usually happens when a problem is found after the live servers come up that is severe enough to justify removing the NPC from the game until they can be patched. <br><br>There are a few other problems which can cause them to pop up unintentionally, requiring a patch to fix them. Often, if it is a critical NPC, we'll patch the zone without taking the servers down to clear up the problem.</UL>

Here's a couple of posts recently made by Alan on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888.html"><b>Shaman Issues</b></a><br>Rorgg said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Admit the spell had its intended functionality before. Your statement made it sound like the way the Rage series has been operating was due to a bug. That's not true and I think everyone knows it. The Rage series spells were designed with the full knowledge that draining empty mana would not cancel them, that was part of the design.]</i></font> <br><br>It was working that way due to a bug. But it was also working pretty much as intended. The two are not exclusive ideas. The bug is fixed. Now we need to fix the "as intended part". <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Admit the mechanics changed for a new spell line and VI did not anticipate the effects of changing the mechanic (which is obvious from Torpor). Promise us better QC in these regards.]</i></font> <br><br>I have admitted that it was changed to make it so that spells that use mana continuously couldn't use mana that didn't exist (I will neither confirm nor deny anything about any new spell lines). We're not hiding it. And we did not anticipate this particular effect to occur with the change in the mechanic. I won't promise better quality control in the future. I will promise that we will work on having better quality control in the future (a subtle difference. The trick here is that if our quality control improves, most people would never notice. You can't see all the problems that we catch, only the ones we don&#8217;t). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Do NOT leave us with a gimped replacement or no fix. ]</i></font><br><br>I have no intention of that. I'd like to see the spell working mostly as it was. But this is also a chance for the community to voice its opinions on this particular spell, at a time when we know we have to change it. Let's keep this thread to that purpose. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. Above all, do NOT flee the thread. The more you talk to us, the calmer we are. The thing we're most afraid of is being left with no replacement, like the other two times this has happened. ]</i></font><br><br>I'm not going anywhere. It's my job to stay here and talk. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. Go /bonk the live team. They deserve it. ]</i></font><br><br>Not really. There are a LOT of spells and spell effects in EverQuest. Missing one on a change like that (of the many changes that are made) isn't too bad. Besides, some of these guys are a lot stronger and tougher than I am&#8230; <br><br>Please, let's keep this thread to the topic at hand. Yelling at me about pets or other issues dilutes the ideas that we are looking for here. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034748.html"><b>Mage Bug with Pets</b></a><br>Thanks for the info.

Brian Hook, one of the most recognizable people in the gaming industry, resigned from his post at Verant Interactive yesterday.  The guys at Voodoo Extreme caught up with Brian today to <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/games/interviews/hook/">get the full story behind his depature</a>.  Here's a snippet:<UL><b>VoodooExtreme: Why did you leave Verant?</b><br><br>Brian Hook: First, let me state up front that this was a completely amicable departure.  Verant was very good to me.  Smed [John Smedley, Verant/SOE Executive VP] and I have a good rapport, and he&#8217;s a genuinely good guy that I like a lot.<br><br>But to answer your question, I was just getting uncomfortable with the very corporate environment there.  You have to understand my background  I left 3Dfx when it had less than 50 employees; when I worked for Silicon Graphics I was just a contractor, so I never had to deal with &#8220;big company&#8221; issues; and at id there were about a dozen employees.  So I come from a very small company mentality.  When I went to Verant it felt absolutely huge  I think there were about 70 or so employees, but I don&#8217;t quite remember  but after the acquisition by Sony it got even huger.  All of a sudden I was working for this gigantic company based out of Japan instead of a relatively small game developer, and that just wasn&#8217;t as enjoyable for me.  This isn&#8217;t a slam on Sony, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m a lot more comfortable working with a small group of people without a lot of corporate &#8220;stuff&#8221; to deal with. </UL>Thanks Steph!

A lengthy post was made in response by Gordon to a thread entitled "<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034311.html">Verant vs. Players</a>" found on the Gameplay Board.<UL>This is the retail version of EQ, the classes and races should have been balanced before you released it. <br><br><b><I>That's easy to say, and for the most part it was true. However we *have* been adding content to the game with every patch, including tons of new zones that over doubled the worlds size since release. Every time we add something, we run the risk of creating an imbalance that needs to be addressed, or else we have a broken game that people will not play. Make no mistake: People will not play a broken game. <br><br></b></i>All the patches should only be adding content and bug fixes, not plugging up ingenious strategies which the players found and which you didn't think of. <br><br><b><I>It goes without saying that 300K people can discover strategies that weren't found by the 40K or so that were in all phases of the beta, and the 2000 people that were in for all but the last month of beta. Additionally, many of these "ingenious strategies" that you speak of were created by us attempting to add more content by way of items, quests, abilites, etc., to the game. <br><br></b></i>We players are not here to find crack's in the design of EQ for you. <br><br><b><I>No, you are here to have fun. However that aside, you will still find cracks in the design of EQ for us throughout that process. I'm thankful we have a dev team working to address those cracks as they are discovered, or again we'd have a broken game. <br><br></b></i>If you truely don't like how we players play this game, or the strategies we come up with, then keep them in mind for when your designing EQ2, but dont punish us here and now. <br><br><b><I>Again you seem to be saying that it would be better to leave gross imbalances in game that cause people to leave rather than correct them. I have to respectfully disagree, and say with some authority that this will not be the case with any game we make. These games are designed to last in the marketplace for a number of years, and need to last that long to cover development costs, both past and present. If they do not draw enough subscribers or last long enough, the game fails and future development is hurt by it. We won't sit around and watch a game fail when we can do something about it. Now EQ was never in jeopardy of that because we've always addressed these problems as they came up, but if we left every problem, or tried to address them all in a "positive" manner by increasing the power of "A" through "Y" because Z is overpowered, it would not be long before everything in game was elavated to broken proportions. <br><br></b></i>Maybe you should realize that this game you created has taken on a life of its own when boxed it and sold it. <br><br><b><I>Actually it took on a life of its own over a year before release when the community was formed by people interested in the game. As with anything alive though, things are in a constant state of flux. Things change, and we have to change with them to be sure that everything stays in line. <br><br></b></i>thats exactly my point. Don't do anything. So what if warriors found a way to solo blues up to 60. So what if every other warrior is doing it 3 weeks later. How does it hurt anyone? <br><br><b><I>So what if all classes found a way to do it? Should we leave it then? Suddenly you have everyone in the game running around without a need to group. Classes become meaningless as one class can do pretty much anything that the next class can. Class A is no longer dependant on class B for good or services in order to advance. That alone would reduce the social impact of the game by making it unnecessary for people to meet each other. Suddenly we'd have 300K people playing a single person game on our servers, with nothing really to hold them together. Aside from the hardcore players, the game would be dead within 6 months. </b></i><br><br>Always ADD never TAKE away because when you take away (nerf) you punish. <br><br><b><I>And *never* make a policy absolute, with exception to the policy of *never* making a policy absolute. Once you completely block out a particular course of action you limit yourself for no good reason other than it being "policy". <br><br>As mentioned above, the policy of buffing up A-Y every time Z is overpowered is not at all suited to this environment. We would be constantly increasing every classes abilities, or the power of their spells or items, because of "inequities" cited by one class or another. <br><br>Can we agree that as long as we have a class-based system, where classes have complimentary strengths and weaknesses, that there will always be people who believe that the strengths are not strong enough and that the weaknesses are too severe? </b></i><br><br>If Verant really does really not like this new strategy, then they should tip their hat to the player who discovered it, and remember to make that strategy impossible in some future EQ game. <br><br><b><I>That's certainly the policy advocated by the ever-quoted "mudwimping" article, an article that I personally disagree with. As I mentioned above, absolutes are dangerous. Completely ruling out one reasonable course of action and exclusively increasing power or abilities of the game as a whole is a BAD thing to do. It's as bad as exclusively decreasing power or abilities. Neither is an appropriate course of action. That article gets a lot of mention because it suggests a course of action that is popular with socieity: more, more, more, never less. <br><br>There's a quote that suits this situation quite well, so I'll paraphrase: What is right is not always popular, and what is popular is not always right. It basically speaks to the fact that people do not always make the choices that are best for them. I'm sure that we could adopt the suggestions in the mudwimping article and please a lot of people in the short run, but as soon as something came up that completely unbalanced the game, invalidating a class or two, and we decided to leave things as is or enter the "enhancement death spiral", there would be no peace. <br><br>Let me string a series of analogies together. I'm sure they all have their flaws, but I think that the point is sound. Imagine if: <br><br>- banks have a policy of *always* taking the customers word for it in a disputed account.<br>- paying taxes was voluntary (some argue that it is, but still)<br>- we released all of the "innocent" people from jail.<br>- *everyone* has a college degree<br>- *everyone* has at least a million dollars <br><br>These are situations that are pleasing and popular to those who are to be affected, but what happens when they are applied to everyone across the boards? Would any of this be right? Yes, if *I* have a problem at the bank I'd like to know that they'd just take *my* word for it. Yes, *I'd* like paying taxes to be voluntary for *me*. Yes, if *I* was in jail, I know *I'd* be innocent of any crime that would put *me* there so *I'd* like to be released. Yes, *I'd* like to have a college degree. Yes, *I* would like a million bucks. <br><br>But everyone?! NO. *I* can vouch for what is good for *me*, but I know that it's not good for global policy. No, I wouldn't like the idea of banks taking everyone's word for it, as I know that fraud would increase to the point of critical failure and that the entire economy would collapse. No, I wouldn't want paying taxes to be voluntary, because then very few would, government programs would fail, we'd have no standing army, and the government would collapse. No, I wouldn't like everyone who say's that they are innocent to be released from jail. That's why we have a court system. No, I wouldn't want *everyone* to have a college degree, because then a college degree would be meaningless. No, I wouldn't want everyone to have a million bucks, because inflation would run out of control, milk and bread would cost thousands of dollars per unit, and the money would all be in the hands of the top 1% within a month anyway, putting them that much further out of *my* reach. <br><br>One final analogy that fits better than the rest. Imagine if: <br><br>- we increased the power of a class/item/ability, etc., every time "enough" (whatever that means) people complained.</b></i> <br><br>So to answer your question, Verant should only add content, or leave things as they are. <br>Koen <br><br><b><I>Well, while I appreciate your ability to state your opinion in a manner that is appropriate for this forum, I must respectfully disagree with the points that you've made.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>
