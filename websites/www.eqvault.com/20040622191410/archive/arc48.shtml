Assuming it's really as easy as you suggest it is to fix&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: For the person that thinks a 2 hour day is a long day of EQ (the way I was for the first 6-8 months I played), that's crippling.]</i></font> <br><br>This is something that I just don't understand. I play casually. If it takes two hours to do something for the player with a lot of time, it still takes two hours for the casual player to do. The only difference there is that the casual player (or whatever you want to call a player without a lot of time to play each week) needs more real-life hours to pass before he or she gets the same task done as others that play more. Honestly, a casual player should know that this is pretty much normal. Heck, I've got a really cool model sitting on a bookcase in my bedroom that only needs a few more hours work to finish. But it's going to take me months to get it done. That's ok with me, because I know that I have little time to dedicate to it. The fact that someone else might have completed it over a weekend has no bearing on it. <br><br>Yes, there are some times when the time lost because of short game sessions (like looking for groups) is really lost time. But travel time isn't one of those times. It's time you need to spend regardless of how many sessions it takes you to get it done. I guess that's part of the reason why I think of it as a convenience than a need. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is that clearer?]</i></font> <br><br>Yes it is. Do I agree that this is a good idea? I don't know. I'll think on it some more. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Alan, if the only good thing to come from this conversation is that this idea is given serious consideration, then the post was worth the effort.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, you've certainly gotten me to think about it. I've also passed a link to this thread to the Live Team&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Second, can you check into the Onyx Encrusted Urn thing? I'd *love* to burn the 100 plat I earned last night experimenting further.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry. It's been such a long time since I responded to this thread, I have no idea what that was all about&#8230; <br><br>Howsabout this. I imagine you have a list of stuff that you want fixed for trade skills. Send them to me and I'll pass them on. Underline the Urn. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The point I was trying to make was this: one of the reasons you have such an outcry over nerfs -- even one as justified as this -- is that VERANT created an environment in which the PLAYERS developed an us-versus-them mentality.]</i></font> <br><br>And, well, I'm not sure how that happened or how that could have been prevented. <br><br>Obviously one of the goals of a game like this is to get people involved and attached. We want enthusiasm from players and developers alike. Unfortunately a side affect of making a good game is that you have to keep it good. Being willing to make changes is important. And when those changes affect something personal, something that the player is enthusiastic about, like his character, the players react. That's a good thing, really. Without it, the game isn't compelling and nobody is here talking about it. <br><br>Obviously we don't want to develop any sort of us-versus-them mentality. It makes things muddy. It is very hard to get points across to people that feel that we are out to get them. And, by the same token, it's hard to understand the points that people are trying to make amidst finger pointing and anger. <br><br>So, sure, maybe it is our fault that people feel so strongly about the game and their characters, we want that. And, yes, we feel strongly about the game itself (if only you could hear a hotly-debated tuning meeting&#8230;). But there is no need for any adversarial relationship between players and developers. At times, though, we are going to make changes that will upset people. And people will say things that upset us (or me, I can't really talk for the whole company on that point). The real trick is to understand that we are all passionate about how this turns out. <br><br>Heh, lots of words but no resolution&#8230; I don't have one. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: That is, it is my opinion that the fact your clients have been treated as victims in the game contributed to the way those same clients react to "metagame" changes.]</i></font> <br><br>That might be true, I don't know. I've never been a part of a GM quest myself. But, well, those sorts of quests are long in the past now. I would hope that changing for the better would count for something. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does that sound better?]</i></font> <br><br>I understand what you are saying. I've done exactly that, but in reverse. Went to a game at a friends house (a long story, but we play with them semi-annually instead of going to conventions &#8211; when we went to conventions we pretty much only played with these folks anyhow&#8230;) and when it was over I just erased items that I had gained off of my character sheet (I kept one). Their world was too rich in items compared to ours. <br><br>I guess the point here is that, and I think you hit on this, the 'loss' in the 'victim' scenario EverQuest is at most going to be some experience points and some time. If I play the victim in my regular campaign, I'm going to genuinely lose. For example, we once had to 'bribe' our way out of Baba Yaga's hut. That was a mess. I was playing my greediest character, therefore he had the most stuff to offer. He was practically itemless when it was over. And this was a 'victim' situation, the Witch would have destroyed us. That was a far greater loss for that character (and, therefore, for me) than a level in EverQuest would be. <br><br>And yet, that was a very fun game for all of us. Five years later my character still complains about it, and he still hasn't recovered much of his stuff. <br><br>But, yes, I agree that to expect a random EverQuest player to play like I do is probably not reasonable. And I still want to stress that this sort of thing just doesn't happen anymore. <br><br>Alpheus-SoL wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Fighting Strahd Von Zarovich, Alan? ]</i></font> <br><br>Him too&#8230; <br><br>But the instance I was thinking of was a trap. Crying child turns out to be a vampire child. Once close enough, charm and that's it. It nailed me and turned my character into a vampire. I had no chance, really. Then, though, the fun began. As the 'victim' in this case, I got to hunt down and kill the rest of the party because I knew that they would tell people that I had become a vampire and I'd have to run from them the rest of my life. <br><br>I'm not sure if I was the victim or if the party was. Be we all lost that day. <br><br>Grimstaff wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Alpheus, nobody likes being the victim. Volunteering to be a victim in a game or play is one thing, but being one because you zoned in and A_GM_God_Creature01 butchers you is not fun.]</i></font> <br><br>But that's really my point. By signing on to play in a roleplaying game you need to accept that the world goes on around you, and getting caught in the wrong place at the wrong time can happen. In a way, that's part of what makes the setting real.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069356.html"><b>PvP Talk</b></a><br>Hi all. <br><br>As with the class talk threads, I'll be certain to get you any information as soon as we've made some decisions.

From Mennix:<BLOCKQUOTE>As I'm sure most of you already know, EverQuest celebrated its two year<br>anniversary on March 16. To mark this occasion, various teams associated<br>with EverQuest dug deep into their archives and came up with a few things to<br>share with the EverQuest community. What did they find? Well first, they<br>came up with some alpha screenshots. Ever see a Dark Elf with a Mohawk? If<br>not, then you must check out the screenshots. We were also able to obtain a<br>very early EverQuest client from Brad McQuaid himself. This is a must-see<br>along with a pre-alpha movie.<br><br>The SOE Art Department did their share also. We recently got the appropriate<br>equipment to create our own movies and the art department has been giggling<br>like school girls ever since. Their first creation was a EQ 2nd Anniversary<br>movie that is now available for download at the EverQuest site. And now<br>completely mad with power and overflowing with ego, the art department has<br>also created the first EverQuest screensaver which will be available for<br>download soon.<br><br>Yet, that is not it. EverQuest concept art is also available along with 12<br>scans of early Keith Parkinson sketches. <br><br>Check out the EverQuest 2nd Anniversary site and help us celebrate a<br>remarkable two years of gaming.<br><br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp">EQ 2n Anniversary</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Mennix!

A <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068770.html">Move Log reminder</a> was written and posted to the Gameplay Board by Alan today:<UL><i>Folks, please wait until the move log has been opened before trying to use the command. If you use the command before it is opened, your request will not be captured by the log. So if you have already executed the move log, you will need to do it again during the proper window. Here is a copy of my recent post about this:<br><br>We will be opening a new server and moving characters from the E'ci and The Rather severs to this new server upon the request of the customer. If you choose to move your characters to the new server, please be aware that all of your characters on the old server will be moved to the new server.<br><br>To request to have your characters moved to the new server, all you need to do is type "/movelog yes" into the chat window while playing a character on that server during the time that the move log is open.<br><br>We will be opening the move log for these two servers on Friday, March 16th, 2001 at 6:00 pm. PST (which is Saturday morning at 2:00 am GMT). We will be closing the move log on Sunday, March 18th, 2001 at 11:59 pm PST (7:59 am on Monday the 19th GMT). The new, yet unnamed, server should be opened some time during the week of March 19th. We'll announce the exact date as soon as we can.<br><br>There are a few things to keep in mind when choosing to move your characters to the new server. The most important thing to keep in mind is that character corpses will not be moved with the characters. So it is important to make certain that you have looted all of the corpses that you want to loot before the characters are moved.<br><br>Also, characters names are unique on the new server. Because characters will be moving from two separate servers onto the new one, there may be cases where two characters with the same name are created on the new server. Because character names must be unique, one of the two characters will be chosen at random and have an 'x' added to the end of their name. If you find that one of your characters has had an 'x' tacked onto their name after the move and you would rather have a new name, please contact your GM by using the /petition function. The GM will help you to change the name of your character.<br><br>Guild structures do not follow the characters to the new server. We will be unable to reestablish guilds until at least a week has passed after the split. On any day after the new server has been up for eight days, the guild leader can /petition for a GM to help them reestablish the guild. Please do not petition for this before seven days have passed, we will not be able to set up your guild before then.<br><br>We will not be moving characters back to the old server, so make certain that you want to move your characters before you type "/movelog yes". And we will not be moving characters for those that fail to execute the movelog command during the stated window of opportunity. <br><br>Alan</i></UL>

The only problem is, while almost every other class has a reasonable easy time getting their epics, Verant has made it very, very difficult for paladins. Problem being, since you implimented the level limit on Vox/Nagafen, you have hence punished us paladins who have lvled up. So, basically, if we can manage to get the levels together to kill Gorenaire, etc, then MAYBE we might be lucky to get a book drop. This is ridiculous.]</i></font><br><br>One of the designers pulled me to the side and explained something to me about this whole situation. <br><br>Let's look at the whole picture here. <br><br>Most people seem to agree that the way it was before the caps on Naggy and Vox was just fine. The quests were hard, but not too hard. Drops were not too infrequent. <br><br>For characters of the right level, that challenge hasn't changed, so that should still be fine. <br><br>Now, consider that it takes about the same number of people to kill the tougher dragons as it does to kill the old ones (35 or so at the low-end and as few as 18 at the high end). Also realize that the books drop at about the same rate off the old dragons as they do off the new ones. <br><br>So, basically, Paladins have twice as many opportunities to get these book as they did in the past.

Fans of the world's <br>most popular multiplayer online game are being rewarded with a host of free downloads <br>and activities from the EverQuest Web Site (www.EverQuest.com.)  For a limited <br>time, Norrathians will be able to download exclusive movies, screen shots, concept <br>sketches, and will be able to participate in online chats with the developers <br>of EverQuest.<br><br>Since it's launch in March of 1999, EverQuest has grown to over 350,000 monthly <br>subscribers from all corners of the globe.

It is set up so that if you play a High Elf there's a good chance you will never get to do some quests in Oggok. There are all kinds of restrictions on what a character can and can't do. Having paid $10 does not mean that you will get to see all the content all the time. If a new player wants to help defeat Naggy, he's going to have to level his character. If a player with a high level character wants loot off of a low level NPC in The Warrens, he's going to have to do it with a low level character. <br><br>Saying that this rule somehow restricts the player of a high level characters is misleading.

A <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/067896.html">note was posted</a> by Alan Vancouvering today concerning "Trival Combat" and other such code:<UL><i>I just wanted to pop in here and let you all know that the plan for such code changes, like the 'Trivial Combat' code idea, is to go forward with them. It is unlikely that we'll move that code or others like it back into the existing game.<br><br>The plan is to try the idea out and see how it works. We want to know what you think of it (after trying it out) and then decide if we will include the code in future content. Yes, there is a very small chance that we'll find some code that is so overwhelmingly great that we'll use it in the old world.

Along with a new patch comes a new message explaining what went in and what was changed in Norrath:<UL>March 14th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>***EverQuest Turns Two***<br><br>Two years ago this Friday, EverQuest was launched, forever changing the course of online gaming.  Today EverQuest boasts nearly 360,000 active subscribers, and a two-year retention rate of 65%.  Peak usage tops 89,000 simultaneous users with average peak usage at roughly 87,000.  The EverQuest community continues to grow daily.  <br><br>We've put up a page on the EverQuest website to help celebrate EverQuest's achievement and to thank our loyal fans.  Over the next couple of days we will be posting interesting content from EverQuest's humble beginnings, as well as a few surprises.  Check it out!  <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp</a><br><br>*Ever Changing, Evolving, Expanding*<br><br>The Warrens:<br><br>As part of our two-year celebration, we're pleased to announce the release of "The Warrens", a free expansion zone located on Odus. "The Warrens" is a low-to-mid level dungeon and the home of the Kobolds on Odus.  You can patch the Warrens by running the "Optional Patch". <br><br>In addition to filling-out the continent of Odus, "the Warrens" will also serve as a platform to try out some of the new ideas brought forth by members of the team and the public aimed at addressing some common gameplay issues.  We would like to see what options might be open to and enjoyed by the players in the future.<br><br>The first issue addressed in the Warrens is the problem of higher level characters competing with lower level characters for loot on lower level creatures.  To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group that "outclasses" a particular foe will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP.  All other loot will drop.  "Outclassing" a foe is defined as having a group makeup such that no one in your group receives experience from the kill.  This can happen if, for instance, the foe is "green" to all group members, or if the group makeup is of such a wide level range that the system determines the fight was unbalanced using regular experience rules.<br><br>Any time that an NPC would have dropped special loot and does not due to it being outclassed, a message indicating that the combat was "trivial" will be displayed to the group. <br><br>As time goes on, we will be implementing new gameplay subsets and adjustements in the Warrens.  Please be sure to let us know what you think!<br><br>The Planes:<br> <br>The Planes of Fear and Hate have been updated as part of our two-year celebration.  Adventurers in the Plane of Fear will notice that some high-level foes are now available.  Rewards for former "boss npcs" have been moved down to underlings that are roughly as powerful as the old bosses were.<br><br>The Plane of Hate has also received a large update, but this one also includes the opening of a previously undiscovered part of the zone, now full high-level expansion-oriented content.  Much as with Fear, rewards from bosses have been moved.  <br><br>Epic Quests:<br><br>As part of the Plane updates, we've made several adjustments to Epic quests for a number of classes.  Previously, questers of many classes were put in direct competition with regular non-questing adventurers for a few coveted spawns.  In these cases, a new step has been added to separate the "Epic Encounter" NPCs from the "Epic Quest" NPCs.  <br><br>For those who are mid-quest, all quest requirements have remained the same.  In other words, if you turn the same items into the same NPC, the same reward applies.  What has changed is that some components may be in a different location from where you expect them.  It is recommended that you check with the last NPC in line or other adventurers to find where you need to go next.<br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>Along with the big announcements above, today was a patch day as well:<br><br>- Fixed a bug that allowed exploitation of the period of time between character control being established and loading of character faction tables.<br>- Fixed the Dagger of Frost.  Its special item flags were improperly removed in the last patch.<br>- The spell, Mark of Karn, has been enhanced to heal more per hit.<br>- The effect on the Celestial Elixir Breastplates has been changed to the enhanced Mark of Karn.  The casting time on these items has also been changed to 9 seconds.<br>- NPCs in Thurgadin will no longer stop traveling when you /hail them.<br>- Fixed a problem present in Nagafen's Lair and the Plane of Hate that caused framerate to drop over time.<br>- Shift-clicking on a stack of items will cause you to pick up the whole stack.  This is in addition to CTRL-clicking on a stack, which will cause you to pick up one.  These both also work for coins now as well as items.<br>- In addition to the above, holding down the shift key while clicking the "Sell" button in the vendor screen will cause you to sell the entire stack of items if a stack is selected.  For example, you can sell 20 peridots by selecting the stack, and shift-clicking "Sell".  I'd recommend though that you give them to your neighborhood cleric first though :)  The ability to buy stacks is on the list for implementation in the near future.<br>- There are a ton of new recipies for trade skill users out there.  Check your books.  <br>- There are a bunch of new quests as well.<br>- It appears that we fixed a bug with the Mend skill that caused it to be unavailable for a few seconds after it was supposed to be ready for use.  Let us know if there are any further problems.<br>- Foraging items will now yield a message giving you some idea of what you've foraged.<br><br>Please remember that the /movelog for the Rathe and E'ci is scheduled for this weekend.  Please read the message below for details on the /movelog.<br><br>*A Message From Customer Service*<br><br>We regularly receive requests from customers that want their characters moved from one server to another, or from one account to another.  Unfortunately, due to the EverQuest EULA, the number of requests that we receive, the desire to maintain stable server communities and economies, and other problems associated with character moves, we can not move characters across servers or accounts.  <br><br>It is important for the integrity of the server that items from a server remain on that server.  We also feel that it is important that characters that have built up a reputation, good or bad, have to live with the consequences of their decisions, and are not allowed to retreat from that reputation by changing servers.<br><br>The only exception to this rule is when we open a Movelog for moving a large number of characters to new servers.  At no other time will we move a character in such a fashion.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>
