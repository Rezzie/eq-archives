The Human city "rents" its<br>underground domain to the Teir'Dals who, in turn, teach ambitious Humans the<br>dark path of necromancy, and reward the cooperative attitude of the local<br>militia. Now, we, Dark Elves, propose ourselves to share our hunting<br>tradition with the youngest residents of Freeport. The northern fringe of Ro<br>has been chosen as the perfect ground for this Wild Hunt! Those who are<br>willing to embrace our bloody ways should look for Radharc at Neriak's<br>entrance, or Moruviell at Freeport's south gate. An escort will then lead<br>them to North Ro, where the slaughter will begin!<br><br>/ooc: EQLoft, the new French site dedicated to EverQuest, organises its<br>first event this Friday (July the 7th). Newbies (level 1 to 7 characters)<br>can meet us at Freeport's and Neriak's gates between 2:30 and 3:00 PM (EST).<br>Then, we will hunt in North Ro, until 6:00 PM. Argarwaen, our Lady of the<br>Blades, will join us from time to time to skin your preys alive and turn<br>their hides into pieces of patchwork armor, so start collecting ruined pelts<br>: wolf if you're small (Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome), cat if average (Elf,<br>Human, Iksar), or bear if large (Barbarian, Ogre, Troll).

Now due to the amount of witty come-backs, sarcasm, and your amazing ability to change the subject to         something entirely differant, and completely avoid the question at hand, I couldn't tell if you were being legit, or just trying to see     if somebody would be foolish enough to do it.

Gordon Wrinn responded to a post today on a question a player raised about the upcoming Bertoxxulous and Karana server split.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057573.html">the original post followed by Gordon's response</a>:<UL>Gordon:<br><br>In the past, server splits have always had a limit on them. The split starts at some time in the US, and then the disclaimer message says that only the first xxxx will get through, and tough luck for the others. Well this discourages many people from moving, because their friends might all make it to the split, but that person could get left behind. And the GM would just say "tough luck". Being left behind by your friends is the worst thing that could happen in this game. Nobody wants this to happen.<br><br>Since this is Bertoxx's 2nd split, can you assure us that anyone who does /movelog will get moved, and if they do not, that they can petition for a move?<br><br><I><B>Though I appreciate your concerns, we couldn't realistically "guarantee" that everyone who registers once we open registration will be moved. For instance, if everyone, however unlikely, registered to be moved, we wouldn't be able to move everyone.<br> <br>The discouragement that you speak of is about the only thing that keeps the number of people to be moved reasonable. Like always, we'll make every effort to provide the best customer-service possible. <br><br>-Gordon</I></B></UL>

A controversial new <a href="/lore/editorials">Editorial</a> is now available to read entitled the <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid962588366,31872,">Excuses of EverQuest</a>.  Written by Graack, this article explores several EverQuest issues in-depth that the author feels Verant should work on.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>Verant has repeatedly asked it's players to use the /feedback command to <br>give their opinion of the game and certain issues that arise. This would <br>allow Verant to have an inclination how of the players of EverQuest feel. <br>However, again, I feel that the feedback-logs are allowed to fill to such a <br>capacity that many feedbacks are lost without having ever been examined.<br><br>Indeed, I have often seen GW post about various issues on how he sees the <br>people who post on the web-boards as representing the minority of players. <br>And yet, he has a very valuable tool in finding the pulse of the majority <br>that he allows to go unused, and wasted.</UL>Enjoy!

A new story entitled <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid962587572,46212,">Aislein</a> was published today in our <a href="/lore/stories">Fan Fiction</a> archive.  Here's an excerpt from this tale written by Steven M. Hackett:<UL><i>Just then, a familiar snuffling sound attracted his attention. Withholding the urge to panic, Daylan dove into a nearby bush, holding perfectly still to camouflage his presence. As soon as he was settled, the five orcs came lumbering out of the trees, snorting and pounding one another upon the back, congratulating each other on some marvelous deed. Their blood red eyes were glowing wit a malicious form of energy and Daylan shuddered unconsciously wen an orc glowered in his direction. He had a new reason to fear these grotesque creatures now. He had been disgusted by their actions earlier, just as he would have been had he stumbled upon the carnage left by a pack of wolves. But now that he saw that they were sentient creatures, he was filled with rage. Not only did they realize they were committing heinous crimes against the peaceful farmers, but they were actually enjoying it! Yet, even this newest realization didn&#8217;t prepare him for the orc&#8217;s reaction when they emerged from the thick canopy and felt the rain beating down upon them. <br><br>        The orcs went berserk. As one, the foul creatures raised their faces to the sky and began to howl. It was a cry of defiance raised towards Karana for sending the offensive precipitation. Their battle cry sounded, the pack darted out into the downpour, heading directly towards the still-burning farmhouse. For a brief instant, Daylan considered unloading his arrow into one of the orcs&#8217; backs to distract them from his father, but he decided it would be unwise to incur the wrath of the Crushbone pack. He was not particularly proud of his decision since in emphasized his terror of the orcs, but he firmly reminded himself that his father was a ranger. Larwyn could take care of himself without his son running the risk of getting killed. Besides, Daylan had his own assignment, though he had a dreadful suspicion as to what he would find in the depths of Faydark.</i></UL>Enjoy!

This is a follow-up article to the reader responses the author received from the original editorial.  Here's a clip:<UL>From the responses to the last editorial, I can see that there is a great<br>deal of interest in this particular topic. I think a couple of points<br>needs to be elaborated, however, so I am taking another stab at this.<br><br>Granted, not having a base of operations on a harsh continent like Kunark<br>must really make some players angry, especially after working through a<br>long dungeon crawl only to return to a city in which you formerly had<br>favored citizen status and end up slaughtered. It would make me angry. On<br>the other hand, much of EQ is trial by fire, and it's meant to be that way.</UL>Enjoy!

Gordon made a big announcement this morning on the Gameplay Board regarding new changes coming to EverQuest.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058462.html">the post</a>:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>I thought I'd drop a line and let everyone know about some exciting changes that we are working on:<br><br>First, the next EQ client will, unless a problem is discovered in testing, include a slash-command that will allow players to turn off display of corpses. This will be a client-side option that will just repress the rendering of the corpses themselves. This will allow corpse-related actions (like sense-corpse) to be taken even while corpse display is repressed. <br><br>The command (/hidecorpses) will have three possible parameters:<br><br>None - Shows all corpses<br>All - Hides all corpses but that belonging to the player.<br>All but group - Hides all corpses but those belonging to the player and group members.<br><br>As asking people "Has anyone seen my corpse?" is an issue that we feel builds the feeling of community and encourages people to help each other out, the command will reset to showing all corpses upon zoning. Also, as a note, in its current implementation, any corpses created after the command is run will be shown. <br><br>This command should help people who experience framerate problems after zoning in to areas known to cause a large number of corpses. <br><br>The second change has to do with quested keys for entrance into the keyed dungeons on Kunark: Sebilis, Charasis, and Veeshan's Peak. It's apparent that the risk of dying in these zones is too great to risk going with only one key. Furthermore, it's become standard practice for people to leave a corpse at the entrance of these dungeons with the spare key.<br><br>As we feel that the idea of dueling and getting killed just to leave a corpse for a bank isn't in the best intrest of roleplaying or our vision for the game (e.g. It's cheesy), we've decided to nerf this practice  Our plan is to have keys for these three dungeons stay with the owner when they return to their bind point. This new ability that we are working on also gives us the opportunity to explore "soulbound" items in the future, but no promises just yet on that.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Gordon made a second post in this thread clearing up an issue one of the players had with his original post:<UL>that when you die in sebelis that the key to sebelis (and charlis, and howling) will stay with<br>you? That way only one key is needed?<br><br><b><i>Judging by the responses, I apparently didn't explain it very well.<br><br>When you die, instead of appearing at your bind point naked, you'll appear there with your key. So yes, only one key would be needed, and there'd be no reason to kill yourself off outside the dungeon to hold your key.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

An event announcement was sent to me by Eric:<BLOCKQUOTE>I will be running a GM type quest with pretty good loot as rewards for those<br>who complete it in the given time period.  This is just a test to see if<br>there is an interest in this type of thing, and depending on the outcome of<br>it, I may run others in the near future.  This quest will have no entry fee,<br>but for me to boost the quality level of the items I will probably charge a<br>nominal fee per person/party that joins if this continues beyond the test<br>run.  If you aren&#8217;t interested in role-playing and would prefer not to take<br>part in this, there is no need to read any further.  For those of you who<br>would like a break from the hum drum beating on mobs in the eternal search<br>for that next level, please read on.  Also, for anyone who has problems with<br>me using Freeport as the city name and Lucan as the boss, please forgive me.<br>It is a must though because using the word &#8220;city&#8221; and labeling the guards as<br>he/she/they throughout the tale would have lost a lot.  This is however open<br>to any race though some may find it more difficult than others:<br><br>You feel as though your lungs will burst if you take another step, but<br>fearing your pursuers are still on your tracks you dare not rest.  How could<br>this have happened to you?  Once a respected citizen of Freeport, your name<br>has been disgraced and your own city has turned on you.  As you escape the<br>boundaries of the city and look around you, you see that the guards dare not<br>pursue you further.  Gasping for breath you think back&#8230;<br><br>Just two nights ago while enjoying a healthy cup of mead you were approached<br>by a sinewy man that claimed that he knew you.  Having had perhaps a bit too<br>much ale, you humored the rather sly looking creature and asked him if it<br>was your fame or you good looks that he had heard about.  Apparently not<br>getting the joke, he came closer and said, &#8220;You are the one.  The one that<br>was foretold.&#8221; He spat at your feet and walked off, but turned with a<br>menacing glare and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t think you can live out your prophecy, for I<br>know your heart well and will see you burned before I allow you to destroy<br>us!&#8221; then disappeared into the darkness of the night.  You shared a laugh<br>with the bartender and asked what the mad man was having because you could<br>use a cup or two&#8230;<br><br>The encounter seemed odd, but hardly worth wasting one&#8217;s time contemplating<br>as angry and bitter people frequent bars as much as hardy adventurers.  One<br>deluded soul was unlikely to be the turn of your fate and he was as likely<br>as not passed out in a ditch somewhere by now anyway.  Sadly, you could not<br>have been more wrong&#8230;<br><br>As you left the bar severely intoxicated, you were greeted by the local<br>militia.  &#8220;Stop right where you are,&#8221; one of the guards demanded.  Being in<br>no shape to argue you froze.  &#8220;Is this the man that you saw?&#8221;<br><br>A voice you have never heard before but that made your skin crawl to listen<br>to it stated, &#8220;Yes, he is the one.  Arrest him before he brings anymore harm<br>to the people of this town!&#8221;  With that you began to feel the world shift<br>underneath you as you were grabbed, thrown around, beaten, and finally taken<br>into custody.  As you awoke the next day you could hear the screams of those<br>who had been placed in the &#8220;care&#8221; of the Freeport militia before you.  Still<br>a bit hazy from the night before you screamed for a guard&#8230;.  No response.<br>Laying back against your cell door a bit exhausted and for some reason in<br>pain, you drifted off again.<br><br>TAP TAP TAP<br><br>Awakened with a start, you found a guard bouncing the flat of his sword<br>against your head to get you off the bars, &#8220;Listen up prisoner&#8230;  I<br>personally thought we should have killed you for what you have done when we<br>found you, so get out of the reach of my sword before it slips and hurts<br>someone!  We don&#8217;t take kindly to kidnappers here.  Tomorrow when Lucan<br>holds your trial, you can expect to meet with swift punishment, so you<br>better enjoy this fine cuisine like it was your last!&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Kidnapping?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Heh, yeah your damn right.  Kidnapping the child was worth slaying you<br>over, but executing the rest of the household will insure that you hang.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Wait, but I didn&#8217;t do anything!&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yeah, yeah&#8230;  That&#8217;s what they all say.  If I had a copper for every time I<br>heard that line I wouldn&#8217;t be working here!  Sweet dreams kidnapper.  Take<br>whatever spiritual precautions you feel the need to now, because in the<br>mornin&#8217;, you&#8217;re going to meet justice.&#8221;<br><br>The night came and went, but this time it wasn&#8217;t spent passed out or in a<br>stupor.  By daybreak you had filed away the bars and were well on your way<br>out of the city.  Such things as missing bars seem not to have gone<br>unnoticed though as you picked up a large train of pursuers and barely made<br>it out with your life.  Thus you have ended up here&#8230;<br><br>While your life is safe for now, your name has been destroyed.  But by who?<br>And what would they stand to gain by destroying you?  Could this all have<br>been coincidence?  That seems very doubtful.  Clearly someone has made an<br>attempt on your life, and the only way to meet such an assault is with the<br>proper defense of your name and deeds.<br><br>Where shall you begin this trek though?  Freeport is not open to you and<br>would likely cost you your head if you returned.  Perhaps sending another to<br>scout out the information&#8230;  No, this is your fight and you don&#8217;t need to<br>bring anyone else down this dark road.  There is one who would be able to<br>help&#8230;  A sagely monk by the name of Cheng Meng&#8217;te is known to reside deep to<br>the south beyond Oggok and perhaps he would be able to see with his<br>clairvoyance who the cause of this great evil against you was.  With that,<br>you set out determined to bring your name justice, and to slay those that<br>would attempt to have you slain you no matter the cost!<br><br>When:  Friday, July 7 at 8:00 PM EST is when this quest will begin and it<br>will last until Sunday 8:00 PM that same weekend.<br><br>Where:  E&#8217;ci West Freeport near the wagons/vendors is where the quest will<br>begin but you may find that the travel involved in completing this quest is<br>in abundance.  Don&#8217;t worry, at no point will I hand you a note and tell you<br>to take it to the Bard&#8217;s guild in such and such zone, so this is NOT like a<br>regular EQ quest.<br><br>Who:  You are allowed to do this quest with 1 &#8211; 5 players.  Please, no more<br>than 5 as depending on how far into the quest you get it may require that I<br>add one of my own characters or a friend&#8217;s into your group.<br><br>Cost:  NOTHING but your time.  There are prizes along the way, and prizes<br>for finishing the quest, but all I ask of you is that you enjoy the ride.<br><br>Requirements:  Evil races will run into a bit of a problem with a few of the<br>encounters and may want to bring a high level friend or two to help defend<br>them from beatings.  Be prepared to duel.  Almost all combat involved in<br>this quest will involve other PCs and for that reason when one prompts any<br>member of your group with a /duel you must accept it.  No waiting around for<br>buffs, no healing up before you accept.  You should have done those prior to<br>the encounter.  If you at any point find the urge striking you to /duel<br>someone, feel free to.  These characters for the sake of this quest are NPCs<br>and if you prompt to attack them, then they will accept and the battle will<br>proceed from there.<br><br>Rewards:  Rewards are based on a few things.  The primary deciding factor is<br>how far you get in the quest.  Some will not reach the objectives at all,<br>some will complete a portion of it and assume they are done, and others will<br>complete the whole quest.  All I can suggest for completing this quest is BE<br>ALERT.  It isn&#8217;t over until the fat lady sings.  You will receive rewards at<br>the end of the quest based on the speed with which you accomplish it, and<br>the fun that you provided along the way.  Role-play if you want to get<br>anywhere.<br><br>Registration:  Please inform me ahead of time if you are interested and we<br>will prepare for you.  All registry will actually take place at the actual<br>meeting place in West Freeport on Friday though and at that point you will<br>give me a group name (doesn&#8217;t have to be creative.  Could be group X for all<br>I care) and a group leader which will actually be the person the above story<br>describes and thus the person that the entire quest revolves around.  If you<br>choose to go solo, that is OK as well, but you will still need a group name<br>for referencing you when you reach certain spots.<br><br>NOTIFICATION:  I know that only a small percentage of the population of E&#8217;ci<br>reads this board, so please notify your friends if you have any that are<br>interested in this sort of adventure.  NOBODY at any point should share<br>information with other groups as YOU are the one on this quest and all other<br>groups are not any of your concern since as far as your group is concerned<br>you are the only ones involved here.  I know that it will be hard, but share<br>all your tales about it at 8:00 on Sunday rather than during the actual<br>campaign.  If you have any questions, contact me in private messages here,<br>or in /tells in the game.<br><br>Thanks for reading this lengthy post and for those of you who do take part,<br>I hope you like it.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon announced some big changes for those Test Server players transfered to the newer servers over the last couple of days.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058382.html">the announcement</a>:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>Many of you are probably familiar with the situation that resulted in characters from Test being moved to Torvonnilous and other servers. For those who are not, let me do a quick recap:<br><br>A few weeks ago we did a character wipe on the Test server in order to cleanse the testing platform. After doing this wipe, it was apparent that many people on the server did not have a reasonable expectation that this was a possibility. As a result, in the interest of providing good customer service, we decided to back out the player-wipe, change it to an item-wipe, and give the players on Test an option to move to one of the production servers.<br><br>During this process, some mistakes were made on our part. In these plans, we neglected to place several &#8220;exceptions&#8221; for valid destinations for Test characters. We moved around 20 characters to Torvonnilous, a &#8220;young non-split&#8221; server. People often start on new non-split servers because they want a fresh environment. There is often a &#8220;race&#8221;, so to speak, shortly after the server comes up to be the first character or group to reach high levels, get good equipment, and do the dragons and planes. There are many people who enjoy this fresh environment as it gives them the opportunity to become a well-known and respected person on their server.<br><br>It was inappropriate for us to inject established higher-level characters into the young environment on Torvonnilous. Transfers of this type, though not particularly relished by the people on the destination servers in general, should be limited to established and &#8220;older&#8221; servers, including split-servers, that are not in the midst of establishing their &#8220;server community&#8221;. A well-established community on older servers can take an injection of new people without a harmful effect upon that community, however the community on the younger servers is fragile and deserves protection.<br><br>In a previous message on the subject that I posted earlier today, I commented that it was &#8220;too late&#8221; to address this issue. However, for the reasons above, we&#8217;ve modified our decision in regard to the Test move. We will be removing the characters from Test that were moved to Torvonnilous, and placing them back on Test for the time being. Owners of those characters should be contacted by email in the near future. <br><br>We&#8217;d like to thank everyone for their patience and understanding in this matter.<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Internet Relations Manager<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</I></UL>

Several posts on various subjects were made today by Verant/Sony's Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the dirt:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058403.html"><b>Message Board/FAQ Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, this message board way of discussing issues has its place, but having to watch some issues get responses and not others is frustrating. Watching you say something will be looked at or tested and never hearing again is frustrating. Having to bump some things hundreds of times to get a response is frustrating.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm all for doing whatever is necessary to make these boards serve their intent. They are supposed to be a good place to discuss issues important to the players, help us address those issues, and provide a way for the players to offer constructive criticism on the state of the game. Obviously the intent wasn't to turn the boards into rant-form where flaming is preferred. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why don't you use a list of issues, to let players see what you are already aware of and a status?]</i></font> <br><br>What you are asking for is a list of transient issues, meaning, things that are currently important but may change from time to time. I'm still looking at getting some forums with posting restrictions set up to handle things of this nature, but we've a few technical issues to work out first. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As an example, where is the bard lullaby song, which you said in about March would be looked at?]</i></font> <br><br>It's still on the drawing boards. We've just had so many other issues that have taken precedence over the past few months. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Hense the FAQ.]</i></font> <br><br>Well the FAQ will be basically for "Dead Horses", meaning things that we've explained many times, which aren't likely to change. He's asking for a list of things that we consider "open issues". <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058407.html"><b>FAQ: Help Requested</b></a><br>I'd like to call on the people that are on the board here every day to help put together questions for a FAQ. What I'm looking for is questions that keep coming up every month or so from people who are new here on the boards. I stress that I'm looking for persistent issues, rather than current issues. For example, "melee binding" would be an example of a persistent issue, where the current situation with dragons would be a current issue. <br><br>I'm not looking for specific class questions unless those questions are definitely persistent in nature (e.g. Druid class-specific armor). I'm particularly not interested in those that are subjective in nature (e.g. "Why do {class} suck?" "suck" in this case is subjective). <br><br>If you all could help out in this area, I'll put some time in over the weekend and next week putting the FAQ together. I'd appreciate it if you could keep the questions brief, cover only one issue per question, and seperate them clearly in your replies.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058302.html"><b>Druid Quest Armor</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why do Druids have no class specific armor quests? I know there is armor available that only a druid can use, such as the BCP but there are armors that only warriors can use as well yet crafted exists.]</i></font><br><br>This question comes up about once a month, and quite frankly, the answer is, because we haven't put one in. It wasn't a priority at the time because other items available in game for druids at the level that they would be doing that quest have better stats than any class-specific armor that we would create. As I've mentioned before, this doesn't mean that we won't create some at some point, but it's not as high on the list at the moment as some other issues that we are addressing. <br><br>And yes, I do understand the desire to have a different appearance as has been mentioned here on multiple occasions. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And last. Why does Shaman totemic only have one piece that has a bonus to Wisdom, which is the most crucial of all stats to a shaman?]</i></font> <br><br>The mid-level class-specific armor doesn't And last. Why does Shaman totemic only have one piece that has a bonus to Wisdom, which is the most crucial of all stats to a shaman? <br><br>Very few pieces of mid-level class-specific armor increase primary stats. Most of them do secondaries. As you get higher in level and acquire better and better versions of class-specific armor, you will generally see better increases to primary stats.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058299.html"><b>Ensare Problem</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This happened to me last night while hunting ogre guards in Ferrott (they are blue to my 39 druid). I was using Ensnare and just kept getting resisted, blew 2 bubbles of mana...Now i know sometimes you get bad rolls on resists, but 20 in a row on a blue????? This is absolutely rediculous.]</i></font> <br><br>It's very likely that you'd attacked one of the newbie guards with high resists. That would probably explain the 20 resists.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058276.html"><b>Test Server Transfers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is it true that Test server characters are being allowed to move to Torvonnilous? Torv was one of the few clean severs left, where everyone could start fresh and have a fair shot at an uncrowded world. Now I hear a bunch of level 50+ are being moved from Test.]</i></font> <br><br>Some built (as opposed to artificially buffed) characters from Test are being given the opportunity to move servers. In retrospect, it probably wasn't a good idea to allow them to move to an immature (meaning: relatively new) non-split server where people are still engaged in the leveling race and sensitive to the levels of people around them, however it's too late to address this now. <br><br>We're trying to provide the best-possible customer service for all of those involved. However it's become apparent that this is one of those cases where giving service to one customer affecs the gameplay of another, to those who are affected in a manner that you consider negative, I do apologize.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058195.html"><b>More on Rogues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Sense and Disarm traps is usless, why not put in something that is or give us something to compensate us for not having it]</i></font> <br><br>We already have. Rogues are currently much more combat-oriented than we originally envisioned. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. It's obvious that posion will never work right.]</i></font> <br><br>I guess that's a matter of opinion. I encourage people to try it out before judging it. It's far more useful and available now than it was before. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3.Last but not least picklock. Was a good idea, but then again you fumbled the ball. The rogues never wanted to be a REQUIRED part of a group we wanted to be useful and desired as other classes are.]</i></font> <br><br>A good part of the rogue undesirability in a group was caused by rogues themselves. If a class goes through the message boards complaining about how bad they are, for long enough, sooner or later people are going to believe them. Rogues are currently an awesome class, and I invite everyone to try one out in your group. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058008.html"><b>Wizard Ideas</b></a><br>I've read the post and I think that it was very well done. To be honest, I like the idea of the spells, however I don't think that it fits into our idea of what a wizard should be able to do. Their strength is not meant to be in the buffing of others. Though I understand the original author's assertion that "buffing of others" is what wizards need to be useful to a group, it wouldn't make sense to change the purpose of a class at this point in the game. <br><br>These spell ideas would probably fit an enchanter better than a wizard, and they really don't need much help finding groups.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057997.html"><b>NPC Casting Time</b></a><br>We can set the casting level of a creature seperately from the actual NPCs level. Sometimes this is used to vary the difficulty of an encounter. Remember that the experience given doesn't take into account any special abilities or spells. <br><br>In the case of the creatures you mention, they *should* be casting the higher level spells, which probably means that it's something in the AI. It could be due to the NPC attempting to conserve mana. Contrary to popular belief, NPCs do not have unlimited mana, they just regenerate it fairly quickly. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058004.html"><b>Rogue Poison</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I thought you were going to come out with some new poisons that might do 300, 400, 500 points of damage]</i></font> <br><br>I commented a while back that rogues are already so powerful that we'd have to be careful with poison to keep from *overpowering* them. I should also mention that it's quite obvious that most of the assumptions about poisons are being based off of parsing the spdat.eff. Don't do that. <br><br>The goal of this change was not to turn rogues into casters. They already do more damage than any other melee class in certain circumstances. <br><br>The goal was to turn it into a viable skill to be practiced. It is that now. Try going out and playing with it for a while before deciding that it sucks.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057996.html"><b>Surname Rejected</b></a><br>When you say that it was "rejected", do you mean by the /surname command, or a GM in person? I'm assuming that it's the former since a GM would most likely have changed it per your request. The /surname command will reject things based upon the name filter. At some time, someone probably tried "Corona" in a way that violated the naming policy, which could have caused it to be put in the filter. <br><br>I'd recommend that your wife petition a GM and explain the meaning. If it'll help her case, "corona" also happens to be the description for a particular length of cigar, regardless of brand. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057987.html"><b>The Sound System</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Please make the footfalls dynamic. Not that constant boot click noise no matter what surface you are walking on. The crinkling of leaves or something like that would be a nice addition.]</i></font><br><br>Sounds like a good idea. I don't know if it would be a good thing for EQ at this point, since all that stuff would take processing power, further reducing framerate in certain points. People with EAX have reported some problems along those lines with current sounds. I don't know a lot about sound programming though, so it could be possible.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057501-2.html"><b>The Account Hangs in the Balance</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Brad/Gordon -- Straight Answers Required, Account Hangs in Balance]</i></font> <br><br>As much as I'd like to be able to give you firm answers to your questions, either pro or con, it's not realistic for me to place hard limits on what we may or may not be able to accomplish. I'll answer your questions to the best of my ability however. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1> In light of this statement by Abashi/Gordon, are enchanters ever going to have the ability YOU PROMISED ENCHANTERS ON YOUR OWN WEB PAGES [before editting *most* of these statements off after I brought them to your attention] to enchant weapons to cast spells?]</i></font> <br><br>Giving enchanters the ability to directly enchant weapons at this point is highly unlikely, as the core gaming engine does not support it. More likely might be enchantments that the enchanter could cast on people in the group that would make them proc. However, though the latter is more likely, enchanters are balanced and anything that we do will have to take this into account. We're not actively looking for a way to make enchanters more viable. They are already considered essential by most groups and well-played, make awesome soloers. Furthermore, they've got the market cornered on jewelry as it is, giving them the ability to permanently enchant items would give them yet another market to corner. Neither is necessary at this juncture for the enchanter to be worthwhile, and expanding upon the abilities might reduce others dependency on other classes. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2> If you are not going to fulfill your promise to enchanters and they are not going to be able to enchant weapons to cast spells, will enchanters be compensated for this by allowing them to assist in the production of magical armor & weapons that don't cast spells? For example, by giving the trade skills a massive overhaul and making mana vials part of a large number of magical armor & weapon items. If so, what is the timetable? ]</i></font><br><br>This is far more possible than the first question, but again not guaranteed. The mana vials were created for this purpose, so all that really needs to happen is for the weapons to be created. Should we decide to implement it further, items made will not be better than items found through adventuring. They will probably be powerful enough to help equip characters who've lost their corpses, as well as those who don't rampantly camp for items and choose to have fun instead. Since this issue is not on our current list of projects, but rather on our wishlist, I can't give you a timetable for implementation. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3> In light of this statement, am I incorrect in believing that Tinkering will never be made viable or otherwise improved? ]</i></font><br><br>This is the same thing as #2. We'd like to improve all of the trade skills at some point, but it's hard to say when it will make it on to our current project list. However, I can say that this issue has been spoken about recently here in the office and is probably closer to being made a current project than many things. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Let me make the stakes clear. By my watch it is 5:30pm EST on 6/28/00. If I do not have an answer from an official source (Gordon, Brad, or GZ) by 5:30pm EST 07/06/00 I will not only cancel my account ]</i></font><br><br>It isn't necessary to put things of this nature in the post, as I'd've addressed your issue regardless. In the future I'd recommend that you don't load it in this fashion, as I may have addressed it sooner. I thought about ignoring it for the past two days, but then decided that the questions might be something that other people are interested in and that they shouldn't be penalized due to the way you chose to phrase your post. <br><br>Remember that honey and vinegar thing.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057509.html"><b>Letter of Apology</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Once again, Gordon, I sincerly apologize for my behavior on these message boards, and you have my word that I will *NEVER* flame you, or Verant again.

Truth be told I certainly don't expect anyone to agree with every issue, I'd just ask that they step back, be honest with themselves, and those on the board. Surely, not everything we do is specifically designed to alienate our customers :) It's nice to see when people notice our intent even if they don't agree with our methods.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057840.html"><b>Abashi's Grammatical Mistake</b></a><br>Thanks for the note, but both words are acceptable as synonyms for "To make sure" or "To make certain".

Gordon Wrinn started a new thread on the topic of <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058335.html">Improving Customer Service</a> on the Gameplay Board.  Here is what he posted:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>We've been working for a while now at improving the level of customer service that we provide to our customers who are in need. We've been hiring more GMs and Technical support staff, and have also created several different types of GMs to help service the players. <br><br>For instance, we're in the process of differentiating between GMs who are there to develop and provide dynamic content (Events, Quests, etc.) as opposed to those who are there to provide administrative services (Customer service, assistance, and take disciplinary action). <br><br>Another drive that we are on is to reduce the average response-time to /petitions in game. This is one area that the customer-service staff needs your help in. We need to reduce the number of petitions for issues that GMs and Guides have no control over. The customer-service staff and the design teams are two different groups of people, and neither is responsible for the actions or work-load of the other.. <br><br>It's not unusual on these boards or others to see someone putting together a drive to /petition ideas or dissatisfaction with some aspect of gameplay when they log in game. This only extends the amount of time that it will take the Customer Service staff to get to people who need some sort of immediate help in game. Though many Customer Service Reps try to extend the courtesy of discussing issues regarding game mechanics with those that petition, the CS Reps are not responsible for the direction that gameplay goes. Given this, /feedback, or placing your ideas in public forums such as this one is the best way to go.<br><br>I'd like to ask for everyone's cooperation in helping the CS staff get to people who need assistance quickly. You can do this by only petitioning when you need assistance for something in game at that moment. Ideas and suggestions should be submitted via /feedback, which are reviewed by the development team regularly. Please help both your fellow players and us by using /petition responsibly.<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

An event was just announced by Kallel of the Bristlebane server:<BLOCKQUOTE>Back by popular demand, Sanguine Blade will be hosting another all rogue tournament open to all rogues of the Bristlebane server.<br><br>The Time: It will be held on Sunday, July 9th at 3:00pm CST.<br><br>The Place: Since it will be all one-on-one competition, the location of this tourney will be Najena. We will simply use /duel for each bout. A few advantages to this is that there will be no outside interference like there would be in an arena, its a fairly low populated zone, so lag should be at a minimum, and the room where the event will take place is large enough to accommodate good wide open dueling. For lower levels, higher ups will keep the mobs at bay so as not to interfere in bouts near the entry. Higher ups can use the dungeon to their benefit as they see fit in between their duels. I think it'll be more fun than just standing face to face in an arena.<br><br>The Details: We will be setting up brackets like we did at our last tournament in Befallen by level: <br><br>Bracket: Entrance Fee:<br><br>Snatcher <br>lvl 10-15 3p <br><br>Filcher <br>lvl 16-21 5p <br><br>Burglar <br>lvl 22-26 10p <br><br>Crook <br>lvl 27-29 15p <br><br>Snitch <br>lvl 30-33 20p <br><br>Bandit <br>lvl 34-37 25p <br><br>Thief <br>lvl 38-41 30p <br><br>Ring leader <br>lvl 42-44 35p <br><br>Masterthief <br>lvl 45-47 40p <br><br>Mastermind <br>lvl 48-50 50p <br><br>And the NEW bracket:<br>Nightlord<br>lvl 51-60 65p<br><br>Prizes will be 100% of all the entrance fees in the bracket. For the lower 5 brackets, there will be a choice of a few items out of guild inventory that can be taken as a prize in place of 50% of the purse. (Would like to offer prize instead for all brackets, but we don't really have anything in inventory that would interest a lvl 40+ rogue) <br><br>The rules of combat are as follows: <br><br>1. Fight naked <br>- allowed to wear 2 pieces of equipment per lvl difference to compensate higher ATK, HP, AC of higher lvl's of same bracket.<br><br>2. FS weapons only <br>- this is to avoid exp loss with dot type proc'ing weapons, and advantages of special weapons.<br><br>3. Range weapons are allowed.<br><br>4. Shield allowed: for those who prefer shield versus weapon in secondary slot.<br><br>5. Bandages allowed <br><br>6. No buffs <br><br>7. No magic healing during combat. <br><br>8. Poison - allowed to be used with the exception of DoT poisons like Snake and Putrid Bane. (Burglar bracket and up ONLY)<br><br>These rules will ensure the winner relies on combat skills, instead of better equipment. Anyone found to be dueling outside these rules will forfeit their match.<br><br>The guild will provide a choice of FS weapons to combatants. However, each is responsible for bringing their own bandages and range weapons should they choose to employ them.<br><br>Pairings will be set randomly by the event organizers with winners advancing to the next round. <br><br>This tournament is open to non-guild rogues as well. Please spread the word to your rogue friends throughout Norrath.<br><br><a href="mailto:kallel@mail.com">Registration for the tournement</a> is required. Simply click on the above text and send your name and what bracket you believe you will be fighting in at tourney time, to myself via e-mail. Depending on the way the individual brackets are filled, walk-ons MAY NOT be accepted into the tournament.<br><br>Kallel Frostreaver<br>Minister of Events - Sanguine Blade<br>Ring Warden - Bristlebane Server </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
