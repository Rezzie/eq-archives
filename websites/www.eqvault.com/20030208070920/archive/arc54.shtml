This is today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055204.html]</i></font><b>Servers Coming Down Tomorrow</b></a><br>You should check the scheduled downtime section of our web site for further details (it should be updated shortly). But we will be taking one server down each day starting Wednesday so that we can do some hardware upgrades on them. We will be starting on with E'ci on Wednesday (7th), Innoruuk on Thursday (8th), and Fennin Ro on Friday (9th). They will be coming down at about 8 am PST, and will be down for about 8 hours. <br><br>We'll be doing the same for all the servers, and we'll let you know the schedule for them as soon as we can. <br><br>Three other servers will be coming down for scheduled maintenance on Wednesday (unrelated to the upgrades). Brell, Rathe and Lanys will be coming down for about 6 hours, starting at about 3 am PST. <br><br>We're sorry for the inconvenience, but this sort of maintenance is necessary to maintain these servers and to keep the game running smoothly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-2.html]</i></font><b>More Paladin Talk</b></a><br>Remf wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Guess this is the appropriate place to mention it; the defense cap seems too high (i.e. unbalanced).]</i></font> <br><br>I don&#8217;t agree at all. The only thing that the paladin has defensively that equals a warrior is the defense cap. Warriors have better armor, skills (like parry and riposte), and hit points. There is no doubt in my mind that a warrior will still be better defensively than a paladin after these changes. <br><br>Kalorad Valrexxaeus wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) We need a useful, big encounter, uber-mob purpose. We have none at the moment. My preference would be a defensive discipline such as riposte. We are by definition defensive tanks. Give us this ability.]</i></font> <br><br>I know that just a few lines up I said that paladins, even with the defense cap increase present on Test, are not the equal of warriors defensively, I am also not certain that they need any other defensive power. I&#8217;ll add this item to the list. But I am also going to suggest that we make no further changes in this area for a while, until we get a chance to see what affect the current improvements have. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Fix the level 60 Divine Strength buff, our ONLY useful high level buff, to stack with the level 50 Ranger buff. We need ONE good buff that makes us needed and makes us unique in that no other class has it. It has to stack with everything.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, I disagree. The stacking of this spell is going to have to be kept in line with the other spells. Making it stack with everything just to make it &#8216;special&#8217; for paladins isn&#8217;t a good reason. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) We need the ability to Stun high level mobs. We are the masters at stuns. No mobs above level 55 or 56 are stunable, i.e., the message says they are stunned but they do not stop beating on anyone, nor do they stop their spell casting.]</i></font> <br><br>I can add this to the list. Perhaps allowing more creatures to be stunned would help a few other classes at the higher levels, without being to unbalancing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) Raise our BASH skill. Also a disc to make BASH an unresistable stun IF it lands, i.e., to interrupt caster mobs, is highly needed.]</i></font> <br><br>I&#8217;m thinking that adding more disciplines isn&#8217;t a great idea. I&#8217;m reluctant to start stuffing in disciplines to fix things. But I&#8217;ll add it to the list, assuming that we do not do something like your number 3. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5) Reduce the reuse time of LOH post level 50. Make it gradually less until level 60. Make it a Complete Heal at level 60.]</i></font> <br><br>No. Look, LoH is good as it is. Perhaps an increase in its healing power is in order. But reducing the reuse time isn&#8217;t appropriate (it&#8217;s kind of the basis power for recast times), and Complete Heal is out of the question. I&#8217;ll add a suggestion for an increase in the healing power of LoH, but I think it&#8217;s fine as is. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6) Add Yaulp IV to our spells at level 59.]</i></font> <br><br>Hmmm... I&#8217;ll add it. But there is probably a reason it wasn&#8217;t added with the last changes. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7) Raise our TAUNT skill. Again, we are defensive tanks. It is currently too hard to taunt mobs off of classes which deal much more damage than us.]</i></font> <br><br>Every fighting class seems to want a better ability to taunt. Folks, taunt is a group thing, not an individual thing. Your group needs to be controlling their aggro. And we just can&#8217;t be setting it up so that any character can flip a switch to gain the attention of their enemy. <br><br>Again, I&#8217;ll add it to the list. But we&#8217;ll certainly have to look at this is relationship to everything else. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Where do i begin. Lets start with the appearance no offense but pally's dont look "epic" with just a hilt. The proc rate is for some reason lower than before and i have even saw procs as low as 1 and 2 damage. Something needs to be done.]</i></font> <br><br>The hilt thing is already on the programmer&#8217;s to-do list. I&#8217;ll add it to this list too. <br><br>I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve changed the actual proc rate of the weapon. <br><br>I&#8217;ll ask that someone look at the damage on this item. I&#8217;ll also add to the list of a suggestion that perhaps we change this effect to something defensive. <br><br>Scrith wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - raise the Paladin (and SK) Bash skill cap as high as Warriors. Rangers are as good at Archery as Warriors, why shouldn't Paladins be as good at Bashing? You can even argue that they should be better, since Paladins use shield MUCH more often than Warriors (unlike Archery, which is used by both Rangers and Warriors, yet they share the same skill).]</i></font> <br><br>Not better than warriors... but I can add that it be raised to match a warrior. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - give Paladins special shields which PROC something. Much like there are Ranger bows that proc when they hit, why not give Paladins shields that can proc? <br>- give Paladins critical hits on Bash. Rangers have it on Archery, how about finally giving Paladins (and SKs) a chance to get critical hits by putting them on our Bash skill? <br>- increase the likelihood of Bash stunning high level mobs. One of the biggest problems facing high-level Paladins (lvl 55+) is that our beloved Bash skill, which we have used and depended on so much since our earliest days, is no longer effective against high level mobs. <br>- please increase the AC on our shields...many of us are still using the same AC 25 shields we had before Kunark was released. Why have weapons (and armor) improved so dramatically since then, yet shields are still providing about the same AC? <br>- how about a new skill, called Blocking? When using a shield, it gives you a chance of blocking an opponent's attack (much like parry and dodge work). This would give Paladins (and SKs) a unique defensive skill that relies upon their role as shield-bearer.]</i></font> <br><br>In fact, most of this is similar to what shadow knights suggested. It certainly makes sense to suggest that these two classes have the same sort of skills. <br><br>ebob said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: One thing that concerns me is the recast times on certian spells. The one that I've had experiance with is Wave of Healing, our Level 55 Group heal spell. Why is the recast time on this spell 1 minute? I would see the reasoning behind a 1 minute cast time if the spell were to heal more than 200hp, but at 55, 200hp is 1-2 rounds of combat from any mob. I belive that this spell should have its recast time significantly reduced, or the amount of the heal increased.]</i></font> <br><br>I can add it to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Another thing that is of concern is the new 'Celestial Clensing' spell. Do you realize that it is a worse healing spell than Superior heal, with a higher recast time? The only advantage the spell has over Superior healing is that the first 110 hp will happen a few seconds sooner than the Superior heal will land. The added 30 second recast time just makes it even less useful. This spell should either cost very little mana, or heal for quite a few more ticks.]</i></font> <br><br>I can also add this to the list. But keep in mind we have a delicate balance to maintain here. We are already planning to look at upgrades for the two secondary healers. Too many healers will really impede the viability of clerics. <br><br>Vikki-the-Valorous wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is kind of a suggestion for all classes, not just Paladins. It involves 2 handed weapons. Now over the last few monthes or so you guys have been attempting to make 2h weapons more viable by giving weapons above 40 delay (rarely is there a worthwhile 1h weapon with above 40 delay) a higher damage cap. <br>My suggestion is instead of raising the maximum damage we can do, raise the minimum. The best idea I can think of at this time would be for the minimum slash/crush/pierce you could do with a 2h weapon would be the base damage of the weapon. For Example: Take a Razing Sword of Skarlon... 25 damage 40 delay... my Paladin has this ( not as my main weapon, but this is for example) and on average I do about 50ish damage a swing (not counting misses). But every once in awhile I'll swing for 16 or so damage.]</i></font> <br><br>Seems like a good idea to me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And, while not on the topic of balance, the Velious spell, Flame of Light, has no particle effect. You just pretty much make the movements like you're casting the spell, but no particle effect.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br>Seanen wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Defensive discipline, of course]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, I&#8217;ll add it to the list. Perhaps to replace Holy Forge (and with the suggestion that, perhaps, we might just allow paladins to get crits on undead naturally...). <br><br>Eliakim wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Disciplines - this topic will be covered many times in this thread by more knowledgable paladins so I won't say much other than paladins need a way to survive and contribute against uber mobs like Venthril Sathir, Trak, Kunark dragons, and the Velious boss mobs. Right now there's no real reason to have a paladin along on the raid. I advocate a shield block discipline equivalent to the Ranger parry discipline. The paladin would have to equip a shield to make it work.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br>TexasRanger said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1.) More 1HB/1HS and shield options. Many of our signature weapons, like the Messenger of the Queen, Soulfure, Firey Avenger, and Firey Defender are all 2 handers. If we are to be defensive hybrids, where are our shields? Why are so may Paladin only weapons 2 handers?]</i></font> <br><br>I've been thinking about this. I think what we need to do is determine who will primarily use what weapon combo, and lead them that way (by no means forcing them into those roles). I see that there are really three types of weapon combos, 2-handed, 1-handed and shield, and two weapons. Off the top of my head, I'd say 2-handers for shadow knights, weapon and shield for paladins, two weapons for warriors and bards&#8230; <br><br>In any case, this is probably something we should settle on and keep in mind for the future. It seems unlikely that we would actually change the Fiery Defender into some new weapon and shield combo at this point. But perhaps we can set some guidelines for the future. <br><br>Deringer wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  1. Celestial Level 59 improvement on Test is inconsequential: It has been shown that Superior Healing is better for less mana in every situation unless one where 110 hp before 4.5 seconds is necessary, in which case Divine Favor covers this. Celestial Line is supposed to be more mana efficient because of its over-time effect, yet this spell is LESS mana efficient than Superior Healing. Like every other Paladin spell, it has stacking issues. You do not need to nerf its hitpoints healed AS WELL AS its mana cost. Please reevaluate this spell, it is, in its current form, almost wholly useless, and at Level 59, laughable. <br>2. Divine Strength Spell is ARGUABLY not as good as storebought level 51 Ranger spell and DOES NOT stack. Make the Level 53 Paladin version 150 HP and the Level 60 version 300 HP, OR make them stack. Currently, this is a huge problem.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, I'll add a request to either increase the healing or reduce the mana on the new Celestial and to look at the stacking of Divine Strength. <br><br>Kithain wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: A larg enumber of people who play paladins want to play the perfectly noble and good knight. I know the erudites have a quest that involves them slaying a bridge builder (a quest better for an honorable rogue maybe) but ghoulbane is such an important weapon (leads to the epic) that it is really dificult for a Paladin to get one. In a game setting of high fantasy one should be allowed to play a purely good character who will not stain thier honor. If this was a White Wolf game of vampire with all its angst this quest would make more sense.]</i></font> <br><br>We could probably argue for pages about this&#8230; I could tell you that an honorable paladin would have absolutely no concern for gaining a weapon, especially if he was taking it from another noble creature&#8230; <br><br>But we won't do that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - Divine Glory (100hp buff at level 53). Grossly underpowered. Please consider that Rangers get Strength of Nature at level 51, which adds not only 75hp but an amazing 25 ATK, making it one of the best offensive buffs in the game. To be comparable in utility, you'd have to make Divine Glory about 200hp and 10ac, I think.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br>-Kleitus- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - Double check that our piercing skill is capped at the same level as our other weapon skills. If you're going to give us lances and spear based polearms then you should allow us to have the same skill caps or just forget about giving us the weapons. Lower skill caps in piercing would make the weapons less attractive for us in the end, especially with our lower skill caps in offense and weapon skills compared to other classes.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not sure that I agree. But you've also reminded me that there is a fourth weapon combo (from my list above). I'll have to add it in. And raising the skill cap will be on my list, though I'd prefer that we just added a new skill for 2-handed piercing&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - Lull line: look at the resist rates + add a failure message maybe even a message about it wearing off.]</i></font> <br><br>This has been noted with other classes, but I'll add it here too. <br><br>Amith wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1> Add store bought Lances so we can practice our piercing skill before reaching 40+ level.]</i></font> <br><br>Good idea. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And lastly please please add WHITE armour or simply add a SirCoat (white robe - with Breatplate like stats) for paladins and a nice shield with a paladin-like image.

This narrows the AC gap between hybrid and parent class.<br>2) Addition of Block Skill when a Shield is equipped (don?t know if this is possible to code, and seems too powerful to simply give the skill to the character if it can be used with a 2hS equipped). Block would be another defensive check the same as Parry, Dodge and Ripsote.<br>3) Failing the implementation of #2, raise other defensive skills as follows: Dodge 165 (10 under Warriors from 155), Parry 220 (10 under Warriors from 205).<br>4) Implement Critical/Crippling hits against Undead for Paladins. Warrior (parent class) crit against everything in melee. Rangers crit with archery. Implementing partial criticals makes sense with the parent/hybrid line of thought, and makes Paladins more fun to play.<br>5) Scale the Lay On Hands recycle timer based on level. Currently it?s 72 minutes per reset. Other disciplines scale down in time based on level, so this is not a request without precedent. I wouldn?t think a recycle time of between 30-40 minutes at level 55+ would be too much, and a scaling formula can be worked out between the current and the new once the team decides on a number.<br>6) Bash to 240-252 (0 to 12 over Warriors from 200). Paladins and SKs are the only two melee classes that use shields the majority of the time; so much so tank looking types with shields are automatically assumed to be a hybrid since ?real? tanks don?t use them. Clerics, Shamans and/or Druids sometimes use shields, but also sometimes use books or other items in the off hand. A maxed Bash skill makes sense for Paladins.<br>7) Disarm and Archery; both skills cap low enough to make them effectively useless. Assuming they are intended to do more than take up hot key slots and be a useful pulling tool, they should be raised to levels where they have more than a remote chance of being useful. Somewhere between 70/75 and the mid-upper 100s there?s a happy ground, I?m sure.<br>8) Add the Evasive Discipline at level 56, the Defensive Discipline at 60. Both should have 2/3rds the effects they do for Warriors (2/3rds of the missed/damage down percentage, 2/3rds duration); keep reset timers the same as for Warriors. <br>Spells<br>1) Move the Armor line down: Guard to 39, Armor of Faith to 49.<br>2) Move the Yaulp line down: Yaulp II to 30, Yaulp III to 39, Yaulp IV to 49.<br>3) Move Superior Healing from 57 to 53-54. Reduce fizzle rate in line with other previously noted comments on SH fizzles.<br>4) Add Remedy at 57-58.<br>5) Move Revive to 39, Resuscitate to 49, Resurrection to 56, Reviviscence to 59. The reason?s pretty basic. Travel spells are shared by two classes (Wizards and Druids). Damage Shields are shared by two classes (Druids and Mages). Primary Pets are shared by two classes (Mages and Necromancers). Speed spells (SoW) are shared by two classes (Druids and Shamans). All the ?market spells? are available from at least two separate class sources, those spells which are generally being sought after. Except Resurrections (specifically what people want when they want a Res, which is some of their lost time back in the form of returned death XP); Clerics are always preferred since they have the highest Res. Doubly so since 59+ Paladins are in such short supply. Granting the hybrid this ability of the parent (Cleric) would not impact the parent?s tactical abilities, only the support slot. And it brings parity to the market of spells we all eternally have varying needs for as we play the game. I haven't met a cleric yet that'd object to help in taking care of the eternal cries for 'Can anyone XP Rez?'<br>6) Change Divine Strength to a 300-350 HP buff (up from 200). Create a 200-215 HP version and place at level 55. Create a 100-105 HP version and place at level 50.<br>7) Addendum to #6 above, also add a Regeneration effect to the Divine Strength line. 3HP/Tick at 50, 5HP/Tick at 55, 7HP/Tick at 60. Maintain stacking with all current spells, including Natureskin, Divine Purpose, and druidic/shamanic Regeneration lines. <br>Equipment:<br>1) Add a ?Lichbane? 45-50+ version of Ghoulbane, appropriate for the level range it would be used in. Basically, an upgraded version of the popular mid level Paladin sword. The post that mentioned this idea and suggested it be yielded by questing to turn in Ghoulbane and Soulfire was a good way to go about it. If the ?sub-quest? to upgrade the sword idea could be implemented as well (where you do a quest for each temple in Norrath and get slight upgrades to your Lichbane, that?s a great idea that would end up with a final version Lichbane perhaps 10-15% better than the unquested version).<br>2) Implement additional Shields in game to address the rather sparse shield choices available to Paladins and Shadowknights who, again, are the only tanks using them. Between four and eight new shields would be excellent, with one to three of them coming in at or over 30 AC. Some of the new shields should be questable, some should be drop; hopefully there will be a division in the method used to introduce them into the game. Hopefully at least two or three of them will have useful and functional effects to consider as well.<br>3) Examine the class-specific weapons available in the game and note the numbers. Paladins are lacking in class-specific (1hS and 1hB especially) weapons compared to options available to other tank classes. A little on the quality side, but mostly on the availability side of the question. Broader selection would really help shake out the equipment options for the bulk of the Paladin class population.<br>4) Reexamine the Paladin Epic; is it comparable to other tank epic weapons? Why is it 2hS when many Paladins are using shields? Various suggestions already made adding additional quests that can be done to transfer a 2hS major quest or epic Paladin weapon into a sword/shield combo would be great additions after balance issues with the current offering are considered. <br>Combat Problems:<br>1) Unstunnable mobs are a real brick wall for Paladins. The Stun line is our single most combat effective line, the one that gives us the most mileage. Mobs where stuns are meaningless render a decent chunk of a Paladin?s combat effectiveness useless. Some encounters should be retained unstunnable for encounter/world balance reasons; others are perhaps able to be tuned down to keep Paladins in the game in these situations. Speaking personally, fighting mobs that cast but are unstunnable and uninterruptible generate intense feelings of hopelessness. To make an encounter difficult and require challenging use of skill is one thing; to make an encounter unalterable through any means is another.<br>Put another way; sometimes it?s good that you know the mob will get the complete heal off anyway. Other times, it just leaves you feeling useless at your inability to have any chance of doing something to counter that which is leading to your downfall.<br>2) The proposed spell on Test, Celestial Cleansing (110hp heal-over-time for four ticks, totaling 440hps healing at the end of the spell, with an additional tick waited before recasting) is a great way to let a Paladin heal while still staying engaged in the fight (skip a melee round to get the heal off on your fellow, then start swinging again the next while the healing kicks in). The problem are the numbers involved. At 59 mobs double for 110 on a really, really bad roll. The well documented severity of Velious raid-level encounters should adequately showcase the disparity between Test?s Celestial Cleansing and the amount of damage it?s being called upon to heal. The spell idea is solid however, if implemented in two or three versions and spread across the spell options for the Paladin. Move Celestial Cleansing to 50 or 51, where it can make a more measurable impact. Put in a 170-200hp/tick version at about 55, and a 225-300hp/tick version at about 60. The Mana/HP efficiency should be very comparable to that of ?normal? heals, as you?re trading away time to get more HPs later, and that should be a tradeoff respected in the costs associated with the spell.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, I know that was a long quote, sorry.

So don't worry about that. Just worry if I've missed a good idea. So please don't repost what you've already said, let's use this thread to move forward.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055465.html"><b>Rogue Talk, Part 2</b></a><br>Hi all. <br><br>Don't bother, I didn't even bring my wallet. I knew what sort of crowd I would be hanging out with&#8230; <br><br>I just popped in to let you know that I am going to start reading this thread shortly. But I'm also not the only one reading these threads. And I have a preliminary response from the team about the possible (and I repeat &#8211; possible) changes to be made to rogues (and, actually, some other classes as well): <br><br>We've decided on another tack for changing Evade. <br><br>Instead of setting you to 120 (current Evade), or reducing your total hate by 33% (our first intended change), this is what we are thinking of doing. <br><br>If the rogue is #1 on the hate list, a successful evade will lower his hate to a point between the 2nd and 3rd person on the hate list. <br><br>If the rogue is NOT #1 on the hate list, a successful evade will lower the total hate by a few percent, allowing "pre-evade" to remain a viable tactic. <br><br>At no time will Evade increase a rogue's hate, it will always reduce it. <br><br>Now for other changes: <br><br>Bind Wounds: Skill cap pre-50 for Warriors and Rogues was 100. We are likely to be moving this to 175, with a max skill of 210. This would mean a 70% binding well before 60th level. We're also adjusting other classes caps higher as well, but in reality, only Monks, Warriors and Rogues used Bind Wounds with any frequency, and only Pure Melee and Priests will be able to bind to 70% of maximum hit points. <br><br>Pick Pockets: Instead of a hard level cap at 45th for target NPCs, we're leaving it as it stands up to level 50 for the player. After a player is past 50th, it is (Player Level)-5 to set the level of an NPC whose pocket you can pick. All other pick pocket restrictions will remain in place, no magic or no-drop items can be purloined. So, to simplify this, at 60th you can steal from 55th or lower NPCs. <br><br>Instill Doubt/Backstab/Special Attacks. We are not going to change the functionality of this, but we are going to make Instill Doubt gray out backstab and vice versa until the timer has expired. This should make it easier to know when you can use the skill, and prevent a lot of dud Instill Doubt attempts. <br><br>We simply can't make stackable poisons without a great deal of coding, and we feel that poison as it stands now is workable. <br><br>Hide and Sneak through zonelines/logoff/linkdead is possible, but once again, will take a significant amount of coding and testing. We're not saying no to this, but we are also not promising that we will do it.</UL>

Alan roared back onto the Gameplay Board with a vengence today.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055118.html"><b>Ranger Talk</b></a><br>Hi all. <br><br>You may already have seen a list of some of the things that we are already testing as changes for the ranger class. Essentially, we are adjusting the level at which some of their spells are attained to make them more in line with their power. <br><br>Here is a list that I, once again, stole from Everlore because I'm lazy and because it seems accurate: <br><br>a) Add Endure Cold at 22<br>b) Add Skin Like Nature at 59<br>c) Add FireFist at 22<br>d) Move Bramblecoat from 49 to 39<br>e) Add Spikecoat at 49<br>f) Add resist cold at 55<br>g) Add Panic Animal at 22<br>i) Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors <br><br>Let's talk about these changes and others that might be needed to 'balance' rangers. <br><br>Keep in mind that I primarily want to talk about 'balance' here. I'll certainly list any bugs that you would like to see addressed, but the focus should be balance. And please be concise when responding. These threads will get very long, and it helps me to be able to read all the responses if they are to the point. <br><br>Let's hear what you have to say.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055131.html"><b>Nerf Absor!</b></a><br>I would gladly except a nerf, especially if it was a nerf to my work schedule. Perhaps I would be unable to 'function' on Fridays. This would make me far less powerful... <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055117.html"><b>Paladin Talk</b></a><br>By now you may already have seen some of the things that we plan to do with the paladin class in the hopes of adjusting their balance. Those changes came about, mostly, from our folks reading the threads about the other hybrids and reading those about paladins that were started in preparation for this thread. Feel free to discuss those changes as well, though I think they are all very much in line with what is needed for the paladin. <br><br>Here's a list that I stole from Everlore&#8230; I was too lazy to actually look them up (but this list seems accurate): <br><br>a) Add Endure Magic spell at level 30<br>b) Add Resist Magic at 55<br>c) Move Guard spell from 49 to 39<br>d) Move Armor of Faith from 53 to 49<br>e) New level 53 paladin spell, Divine Glory, clone of divine strength but 100 hp instead of 200<br>f) New level 59 spell, Celestial Cleansing 110 hp healdot per tick, for 4 ticks. 1.5 second casting time. Recast time 30 secs.<br>g) Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors <br><br>So let's start the discussion. Please be detailed when explaining things. But at the same time, please be precise. I really don't need your background as a player, or detailed examples of gameplay (unless they are needed to explain a game mechanic). These threads get long, and anything that you folks can do to cut down the amount of text or increase the readability of the posts is appreciated. <br><br>And remember, we're primarily discussing 'balance' here. Bugs and such are fine to point out, but they are not the main reason we are here. <br><br>So let's hear what you have to say.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114.html"><b>Rogue Talk</b></a><br>Hello again. <br><br>This will be the thread for discussion about the rogue class. The idea is to look at the things that need to be changed to make the class 'balanced'. With that as the primary goal, I am still interested in hearing about bugs and other such things. But, primarily, I want to talk about balance. <br><br>My take on the rogue is pretty similar to that of the warrior. They are pretty well balanced. Obviously with EverQuest as a primarily player vs. environment game, some of the things that thieves traditionally do are not really part of the package. That's why, in EverQuest, they are titled rogues. <br><br>Again, I have had little time (actually, no time at all) to do research on rogue concerns before starting this thread. So please be as detailed as you need to be to get your point across. But, at the same time, please remember that this thread will get long. So being concise and readable is important too. <br><br>I do want to report one thing that we have already discovered internally about rogues that is broken and will be fixed when we make these changes. Yes, it is a nerf, but not in the true sense of the word. <br><br>In the old days, NPCs had a limited size to their hate-list (basically the way that they track who they are angry at). In those days, evade would just drop you to the bottom of that list. Recently we increased the size of that list dramatically. This allows us to do a lot more with NPCs. But evade was never changed to reflect this, so it still drops you to the bottom of the hate-list. Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone. The rogue can then beat the NPC up with impunity. Basically, evade is far too useful for avoiding aggro from an NPC, and we're going to change it to be more in line with its original function. <br><br>I wanted to let you know that at the outset. Please don't make it the focus of this thread. It&#8217;s certainly something we should talk about.

Keep a few things in mind here. Clerics get any shared healing spell many levels earlier than any other class. Clerics have a larger variety of healing spells to choose from, making them much more flexible in their healing powers. Clerics are also innately better healers than any other class. They will heal more hit points with the same spell than any other class (they have a built in bonus on all their healing). <br><br>I had the pleasure of talking to several clerics at the Faire. After talking with them in depth about this change, each of them was willing to admit that it seemed like a fair enough thing to do. Admittedly, they had their reservations, but they accepted the changes as probably a good thing for the game. <br><br>I wish some of you that disagree would have been able to come to the Faire and we could have talked about it in person. <br><br>But I am convinced that this is the right thing to do.

Shoji Tsunami informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Name_Of_Submitter: Shoji Tsunami<br>Event_name: Vox Slain by the Karana Council of Guilds<br>Email: xphlyboy@yahoo.com<br>Guild_Sponsoring_Event: Sacred Band Alliance<br>Date: 02/02/2001<br>Time: 07:30 PM CST<br>Event_Description: Last night, February 2nd, the combined forces of the Karana Council of Guilds under the leadership of Haemish MacClellan and the Sacred Band Alliance, invaded Permafrost Keep to slay the fair Lady Vox.  There were a number of interesting things that took place that made this raid so unique.<br><br>-	The last server split took most if not all of our talented raid leaders and strategists, so Haemish, a Barbarian Warrior, whom at the tender age of 39 Seasons, took up the mantle of leadership by organizing and leading this raid.<br><br>-	The final raiding parties consisted of 8 groups ranging in level from 52 at the high end all the way to our lone bard at 37(who was critical in keeping the forward group alive long enough for the nukers to kill Vox).  All in all, the average level was about 46.<br><br>-	The servers went down halfway through the raid &#8211; but we regrouped and cleared the castle again for a second push and then launched our attack.<br><br>-	We did this raid with only 2, yep count em, 2 !!!! clerics (a 51 Vicar and a 40 Cleric) and 1 Bard.<br><br>-	The raiding parties consisted of players from a collection of over 15+ small to medium sized guilds that all belong to the Karana Council of Guilds.<br><br><br>Lady Vox was very generous on this raid and dropped the following (sadly no FA books for the Paladins):<br><br>(2) McVaxius&#8217; Horns of War &#8211; One defaulted to Merithment 37 of Illuminatus, and the other was won by Edina Elvandar of Haven of Light<br><br>Crystalline Spear &#8211; Tanniss Riverwinds - 51 Champion of Forever Knights<br><br>Staff of Forbidden Rites &#8211; Drusila (DRU) of Kindred of the Moon<br><br>Warhammer of the Divine Grace &#8211; Azuriem Angelgrace &#8211; 40 Cleric and Leader of guild Illuminatus<br><br>Tobrin&#8217;s Mystic Eyepatch &#8211; Morgail D&#8217;unistar - 51 Wizard of Fell Omen<br><br>King room loot &#8211; Vox Bracers to Salani (47 Warrior) and Crystalline Sword to Cretar (51 Ranger).  With all the talk of Magic and Cold resists &#8211; you can imagine how hot and heavy the rolling was for the Vox Bracer <chuckle>.<br><br>We also managed to retrieve 2 Prickly Pears for the Shadowknight Lifeleech spell quest won by Silver Daggers and Fell Omen to be passed down to their respective ranking Shadowknights AND, 2 Blocks of Permafrost &#8211; marking the beginning of the epic quests for 2 more of Karana&#8217;s Warriors.<br><br><br>The KCoG would like to publicly thank Jzonn and Halagar on Ayonae Ro, Steelheart of Avenging Crusaders, Solonel, and Jannelle Alcedonia of Ashborne, and Pippi Langstrump of Silver Daggers all of whom provided the new management team with assistance in planning, strategy, and execution of the raid.  Your advice and guidance in advance of this raid was the lynchpin of our success.<br><br>The Karana Council of Guilds is a loose community of dozens of small to medium size guilds.  The KCoG sponsors a variety of player driven events ranging from player run &#8220;Battle-Chess&#8221; type chess tournaments in Butcher Block, to low level Tournaments all the way on up to Planes and Dragon raids.  For guilds that are not planes or dragon capable, the KCoG provides a fantastic opportunity for players of sufficient levels in those guilds to experience these large target encounters.

Brad McQuaid shed some more light on the changes coming to Donal's Breastplate in <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944.html">this thread he created</a> on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>I just read through Absor's post and the replies to it.<br>I wanted to clarify some things.<br><br>First, it didn't take 6 months and 300,000 people to find the problem. The problem was only made apparent recently, with Velious and the removal of the HP cap. The breastplate didn't appear as a problem until encounters started lasting much longer than they had previously. We made one attempt to address the issue, found out it wasn't nearly enough, and now are faced with having to do this change.<br><br>Removal of the HP cap added more variety to the game -- it changed strategies and tactics. No longer were we forced to simply make mobs kill in a very short period of time. Overall, this is a very good thing for the game -- variety and encounters that require differing tactics is good.<br><br>That said, whenever we do change or add behavior or other significant aspects of the game, other unforeseen problems often surface. It's the nature of the genre -- these game's change and evolve, and every change, small or large, can have unexpected ripple effects.<br><br>A second clarification: less than 5 or so mobs in Velious were created assuming the breastplate would be used, and this was mostly likely in error (i.e. we shouldn't have made that assumption in those cases). We will be addressing those mobs and tuning them down accordingly.<br><br>In summary, I'm sorry we goofed up -- it does happen. It will happen again. It's the nature of the beast, but we will always do our best to minimize these occurrences. And we will also do our best to react as fairly as possible when we are forced to act, attempting to do the right thing for both the individual player as well as the game as a whole.<br><br>It is unfortunate that the item was created in the first place, given its potential for problems, and it's also unfortunate that we didn't realize how much more magnified that problem would become when the HP cap was lifted. <br><br>That said, again, we're not perfect, and we will continue to make mistakes as long as this game continues to grow and evolve. And, no matter how dedicated our testing staff is, or how carefully we watch for problems on test, we will miss things that 300,000+ players will find. I don't see this changing, and I certainly don't think this is something unique to EQ, but rather something inherent to the genre -- no other type of game changes as often and as significantly, nor involves such a huge community of players who both work with and compete with each other.<br><br>I know that what I've said probably won't stop the flaming, and I know this is disappointing to both players who have the item as well as those who were planning on obtaining it one day -- I don't expect to post and have happiness follow -- but I did want to at least try to explain the situation in more detail, and to clarify it. And I also think it's important for us to try to manage expectations as they relate to the future.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

Alan had a few parting words to share with us before leaving for Baltimore:<UL><LI><a href=""><b>Before Absor Leaves For Baltimore</b></a><br>I probably will have limited access to the Internet while I'm out of town. So I won't be posting much, if at all. And I won't be doing too much reading of the class threads either, sorry. <br><br>When I get back I'll be starting three threads (I think I'll be back on Monday&#8230;), Rogue, Paladin and Ranger Talk. I'm moving Rangers up because I want them all done by the end of the week. I will also be starting Necromancer and Magician talk threads later in the week. <br><br>Some time the week after I'll be posting my lists for each class. <br><br>I wanted to, once again, stress that the whole idea with all of this is to balance the classes, or get as close as we can. This might very well mean an increase in the strength of a class. But it might also mean a reduction in the strength of a class. We will consider 'nerfs' if they seem necessary. I am not suggesting that we are looking to nerf anything, but I also want you to be aware that we may do so. <br><br>So I'll see who I see in Baltimore. Have a good weekend.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745.html"><b>Bard Talk, Part 3</b></a><br>Draelon wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'm not going to argue that this change is necessary, but it is one of convenience. I don't see how summoning 5 or 10 or 20 at a time would imbalance anything. It's not like food and drink have any effect on how fast you kill a mob. This creates extra down time, when it should reduce down time by making our trips into town fewer and further between.]</i></font> <br><br>And that makes perfect sense. I guess this is just one of those things that I sorta shrugged at, and I probably shouldn't have. I'll add it to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I don't mean to be confrontational, but I think the error is on your part. We don't want our haste to bring us in line with warrior damage. Look at it this way... ]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, then it was the way it was written that was an error. The quote pretty much says that he (or she) wanted the haste to bring him in line with a warrior for combat ability. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The stackable haste songs require an instrument to be played, eliminating the bard's ability to deal melee damage. In order for the Eravj songs to be useful in any capacity, they must recoup the loss of the bard's melee ability and then some, otherwise, it's more efficient for the bard to keep on using his weapons. <br>As it stands, adding an additional 5% haste to the entire party doesn't even come close to the damage that a bard can deal out if he continues to use his weapons, that's why we feel the percentage is too low.]</i></font> <br><br>All of this I understand. Though it could easily be argued that a 5% haste, in the right party, could provide more damage than the bard's blades. But the point is valid. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Our levle 39 charm song requires mana each time it pulses. This was implemented to limit the amount of charming a bard could do. Using Dirge drastically impacts our ability to charm. Furthermore, is 300 hp of damage so powerful that it warrants only being useable every 40-80 minutes?]</i></font> <br><br>No, it's probably no that powerful. I'm just leary of the suggestions that bards gain their mana back a lot faster, as that affects the charm song as well. Perhaps the better route is to look at the damage ratio or mana cost of the dirge. For safety sake, I'll add both to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Lastly, you mentioned that you would be looking at the Lute of the Howler. Can you explain what about the lute makes it imbalancing? Bards (along with rogues) already recieve some illusions via items (mask of deception, mask of obtenbration, iksar hide mask) how do these differ from the lute's illusion?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, it isn't that different, not at all. Though I can see a greater objection to the werewolf form, for two reasons. It's not a player race, and it's the newest item to blurr that whole class distinction line. But you need to understand that my personal feeling that this item (heck all of them really) is a bit out of place does not mean that the team will agree with me. And even if they do, there's not a real high chance that anything would be done to the item. <br><br>NadiraAndante wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My personal issues about bards sortof parallel their previous work. Let me tell you, it IS annoying sitting in a group with an enchanter/shaman, and really having to wrack my brains to find effects from my repetoir that will enhance group effectiveness. Part of the problem is bard song stacking among other songs, but haste and slow stacking with similar spell effects would really help our groupability, and bards are absolutely supposed to be a group oriented class. <br><br>I don't see how helping our group reach the haste cap faster is unbalanceing. The game was played for a very long time at the haste cap and was still hard. Not all people have super haste items. Making them stack would increase our effectiveness while in a group, while not decreasing the effectiveness of the shaman/enchanter. Same with slows.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, it seems that the original design did consider this a balance issue. <br><br>I'll certainly add the whole haste and slow stacking this (I hope I mentioned this before, because it's been on the list&#8230;). I just don't know that you should expect a change. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Which brings me to my little tiff about our snare. We have to constantly recast this thing to make it work, its range isn't the greatest, and its resistance rate is pretty high...why does it also have no reliable effect time?? I know bards have to pay for no-mana effects, and believe me we DO pay for it our entire lives, but do we have to have every single disadvantage rolled up into one song?? When do the disads outweigh the ads?? Probably not in snare for a while, since it is the only effect of its kind we get from 23-51 so its <br>low range, high resistance, short effect time, AND unreliable effect time (best case is what 12 seconds?? Level 1 druid snare lasts how many times that??)]</i></font> <br><br>Well, it may have a much shorter duration than a druid snare, but you can also re-snare it, what, every 6 seconds? But I guess I can see that there may be too many restrictions on it. But keep in mind that this is not really intended to be a song that you can lock down something forever with. There has to be a pretty serious limitation on songs ('free' is always a dangerous thing when you are talking balance). <br><br>And, rather than quote more text, I understand your request for a raise in your secondary-type skills. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So, to balance bards you have to increase our level-effect caps on our songs, taking into account the raise in monster power between 50-60 when WE become 50-60 (since our level=song effect level augmented by instruments when possible) <br><br>And I would like to see our low-capped jack of all trades skills brought up to a level where they work at a fair level, like 2/3 or 1/2 the time of that skill's master expects success. <br><br>Plus significantly raiseing our defensive skills so that we're still below SK/Pally/ranger by a recognizeable ammount, just not a very large ammount.]</i></font> <br><br>Good, I like summaries. Makes my job a little easier. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: PSALMS of purity and vitality (29/37)...they're supposed to cure poison and disease eventually right?? They are STILL broken. I have never been able to cure someone with either of these songs, regardless of how many times myself or that other see the 'you've been cured' text. Try it in hate on the kirakui disease. I left the cure song on for about 10 minutes straight to no avail according to the afflicted paladin. Thats a lot of pulses yes?? And she DID say that she saw the cure message a great many times. It's been broken since release, they say it was fixed, but apparently that is not the case. Check it please.]</i></font> <br><br>Sure. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And many of our songs have caster effects now, and its the new ones. Namely, the chants line 30/38/46, Nivs level 47, Shield of Song 49, Selos song of travel 51, and I believe our cantana at 55...casting effects with a lute or drum, can you pleeeeeease let me play my instrument like the bard I am instead of throwing it over my head and stretching!?!]</i></font> <br><br>I can look into that. As always, I have to give you the 'that's gonna be a low priority item' warning on these sorts of things.</UL>

Alan again hit the class threads hard today on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-3.html"><b>Monk Talk, Part 3</b></a><br>NyogTha wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This post was meant to show you that it is possible to twink and cheat this quest which I KNOW was not meant to be done via the Verant design team.]</i></font> <br><br>No worry, that's how I understood it too. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: SOLUTION: <br>Make all sashes/headbands NO DROP<br>Take the robe off of Brother Zephyl/Brother Qwinn<br>Do not allow for multi-questing either robe<br>Have Kaiaren hand the quester a container and have the the fang and Book of the Celestial Fists be combined and handed back into Kaiaren in order to receive the epic.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Though these ideas do have merit, they will, as you say, over power the class too much. Warriors get stun at 55 so why should we get it at 5?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, my thought was that at, say, 50th level, one of the skills you gain at 5th might get a new bonus, like stun or something. Same damage level, making it only really useful for it's special power. A way to give a monk a special skill without linking it to a higher level skill (making that skill too powerful), and giving it the limitation of much reduced damage. <br><br>This was only a thought, as I am not really convinced that monks really need any new skills. They have a pretty solid selection as it is. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: OK, the idea to fix Thunderkick is wonderful. It is easily taken care of with the use of a MINIMUM damage level. That is already on your list of things to address and we thank you. <br><br>STUN on T-Kick is a bad idea. We already get a discipline at 60 that allows us to stun called "Silent Fist". Please do not add this to T-Kick.]</i></font> <br><br>Got it. Obviously I haven't had time to familiarize myself with all of the skills that a monk gets. I was sorta relying on you guys to help me out there. Once I have these lists of ideas, though, I am going to give them all a reality check. I suspect that the stun on Thunderkick idea would have been tossed out when I got up to speed and discovered that it was an ability that monks already got at 60th level. Obviously it's possible to give a stun earlier, but probably not warranted. Thanks for the heads up. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This would probably be the best method of doing so. Please weigh both of these ideas.]</i></font> <br><br>We will. I think these might be the best two idea for raising monk damage a bit. But, again, let me clarify that I am not convinced this is needed. We'll have to decide if the class needs more damage post 50 before we even look at these. But I don't think either of these ideas is easier (linked special attacks and unlinking foot/hand attacks) than the other from a programming standpoint. I don't know for sure, but they sound like they might actually both be fairly easy to do (I can hear the programmers screaming now, I can see them lighting torches&#8230;) <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But giving us the ability to just "push back" the caster with our specials is EXACTLY what we need.]</i></font> <br><br>Fair enough. And maybe not with all of the attacks. Perhaps all past a certain level, or all kicks&#8230; something like that. A good idea, though, and easier to suggest than a stun. <br><br>Neou_the_Cyber_Monk wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think Absor leaves today to Baltimore so no more hearing from him anymore. ]</i></font> <br><br>Tomorrow morning, actually. So this will be the last you hear from me for a while.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-2.html"><b>Warrior Talk, Part 3</b></a><br>First, a few of my observations about warriors (you need to know this so that you can correct me where I'm wrong). As the 'base' class that other combat classes are built around, it should be very hard to find anything that is in need of change for the warrior. I'm reading things like more hit points&#8230; no. If we change warrior hit points, then we have to change all the other classes hit points, since the basis for hit points, at least on tanks, is the warrior&#8230; <br><br>I really don't expect to find too many things that need to be changed about warriors. <br><br>Also, I actually hope to see as many suggestions for 'nerfs' as for improvements. Keep in mind that the warrior is pretty much the base class, so it is very unlikely that we will be improving something that has any major effect unless it addresses some deficiency. If not, then this might actually be one of those cases where we need to do a sort of give and take. I guess I'm saying that by their very nature, warriors just about have to be balanced, and an improvement to them might necessarily require a change to all other fighting classes to match them. And that's not really what I'm looking for. <br><br>And, well, just like every other class, I want to warn you that a close examination like this brings the possibility that we will see something that needs to be nerfed. For example, I really don't like the idea that warriors have so many spells available to them through items, especially things like invisibility. I intend to ask that these things be looked at. My suspicion is that they won't be removed, we don't like to do that. But as a matter of class balance, I think it should be looked at. <br><br>My most powerful D&D character, by far, is a warrior. He's not powerful because he fights really well, though that's part of it. He's powerful because he has a lot of items that allow him to act like a caster. He isn't that high level, but he is more wanted in groups than my higher level characters. He's obnoxious, too, so it's not because of his personality&#8230; <br><br>Anyway, don't be too surprised if I don't pick a lot of suggestions from your lists. There might not be too much that needs changing. <br><br>Filo wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Another nice addition would be the addition of an "AE Taunt." In multi-MOB situations it would be nice if the warrior had a skill that would attract the attentions of more than one mob in the vicinity. Of course, this skill would have it's own drawbacks . . . be careful what you wish for.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, that's not such a bad idea. It has it's own drawbacks built right in. :)  I'm even willing to suggest a version of this that might allow the warrior to attack all creatures in the area (one swing). But it would have to be very high level and very limited in re-use. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Another area where Warriors seem to be a little lacking is in the AC and HP department. I am not suggesting that a huge move is needed in either of these areas, but in the high level game, there is precious little difference between a warriors AC and HP versus the hybrids and melee "wizards" (Rogues and Monks) ]</i></font> <br><br>That's exactly the opposite of what the hybrids, monks and rogues say&#8230; A lot of them think that there is too wide of a gap between their hit points and/or armor class and that of a warrior, and they want more. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is further compounded by the relative difficulty of the warrior epic as compared to the others. Why the double whammy?]</i></font> <br><br>I don't know&#8230; I really don't think that the warrior epic is relatively harder than most. It seems to be pretty middle of the road, to me. But I'll add it to the list (along with the request that we give it haste). <br><br>Aanya said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Other classes getting to close to warriors <br>I believe that warriors should be able to tank better than Paladins and Shadow Knights. I see that you "noted" those classes wishes for higher hp, better defensive skills, higher offansive skills etc etc. What they asked for, was for you to make their tanking ability close to the warriors. Our tanking ability vs most normal mobs is fine (except for taunt), but if you increase the tanking ability of the SK and Paladin, keep in mind that there would be no real reason to play a warrior at all. Why play a warrior without spells when you can play a warrior with spells.]</i></font> <br><br>We will keep that in mind. Remember, the warrior is the basis from which their skills and such are balanced. <br><br>evilsofa said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I've been watching the SK talk, and part of the problem there is that an improvement of the SK's defense (and, I'm sure, the Paladin's, when their talk begins) would be an intrusion on the Warrior's role as the ultimate defense. One way to give the SK and Paladin some wiggle room to improve their defense would be to improve the Warrior's defense in tandem.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, even if knights had exactly the same armor class and defensive skills as a warrior, they would be worse tanks, since they have noticeably fewer hit points. As I said earlier, improving warriors would almost by default mean an improvement in those other classes, so that the gap would not close. If we choose to close the gap, then warriors will have to remain where they are. I'm certainly not going to advocate an increase in warrior power _just_ so we can give more power to the hybrids. That seems sorta backward to me. <br><br>ErikTorvald wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: BIND WOUNDS.... <br>Please allow the percentage healed to increase with level.

The bind wound is nothing more for the times when you have no cleric, druid, shaman, or necro handy.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, I'm not one to advocate something that is specifically intended to improve the solo ability of any class.

Tdir informed me of the following events:<BLOCKQUOTE>Lanys T'Vyl appeared in Rathe Mountains tonight, seeking one of her children to lead her to Oggok to find the evil shaman who gave her a flawed spell.  Trytiin led her there.  Once she made it to the city she was greeted by myself, Tdir, and other believes of the dark, to protect and escort the Lady of Hate.  We entered the town and explored, she looked for an ogre to lead her about the town.  We traveled in she pointed out various spots of good places to hold if Oggok was ever under attack. She also hinted to a plan of battle soon by either Firiona Vie and her followers or a possible civil war in the Tier'Dal.  She believes her King doesn't have trust and faith in her to win the war between good and hate.  So she told us true followers of hate to prepare for war.  She is waiting for the next move to be made then she will show herself again.  We heard the shaman running about in the town trying to get away.  He hid himself as a guard, that was a mistake.  She caught on and slayed the dumb ogre.   On our way to his known presense, the Daughter of Innoruuk attacked a Paladin who was attempting to kill one of the ogre guards.  He ran with his tail between his legs out of town.   Yet he came back and taunted her, she quickly summoned him and taught him a lesson.  She also decided that the Priest of Discord was a joke and quickly killed him aswell.

If you want it rare, implement some interesting monk quests where they can have their intrinsic AC or dam/delay raised through a quest rather than a item, possibly getting those quest items off the same mobs with the same frequencies as monk item drops now. They could be questhounds rather than gearhounds. <br>But, alas, it's too late for that now, I guess.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, it's never too late to ask. I like the idea of making monks more reliant on their hands than on weapons, on their skills than on armor. You're right, it might be too late to make such a dramatic change. But it warrants at least asking. There's no reason that a skill can't be just as hard to get as an item, just put the trainer at the end of a tough quest. <br><br>Pantheon wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Throwing should get a chance of doing criticals]</i></font> <br><br>Interesting idea.

If a monk successfully uses Flying Kick on an enemy -- connects for damage -- then give a chance (based on Double Attack skill, preferably) for the monk to automatically use Dragon Punch/Tail Rake. If Dragon Punch/Tail Rake connects for damage, give a slightly lesser chance of doing an Eagle Strike. This is not only an interesting solution, it would make raising all of the monk special attack skills more important.

(Call of Earth, enchanter haste spells, most bard songs, Speed of the Shissar, etc.) At least alter it so that even if the haste is not usable due to other, better buffs then the additional effects -- the extra +AC and +ATK -- will stack anyway, similar to the way the Robe of the Whistling Fists worked. It's pretty bad when a well-meaning ranger tosses me Call of Earth and costs me 54ATK and 12AC. The ranger buff especially does not make sense because Call of Earth is NOT a Haste Buff, and the Celestial Tranquility Effect will indeed stack with the upgrade, Strength of Earth.]</i></font> <br><br>That seems to make sense to me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7) At least consider spreading the weight limit increase out over the post-50 levels.<br>Few monks will make 55. Even fewer will make 60. Therefore, weight increases at those two points are not terribly useful. A 2lb increase every other level (i.e., 52, 54, 56, etc) would result in a weight limit of 24 at 60. A 1lb increase every post-50 level would be another way to implement the changes, and would also result in a weight limit of 24 at level 60. If these are "too much" of a weight increase (the current max weight limit at 60 is 22lbs, from four-pound increases at 55 and 60) then skip levels 55 and 60, when we get our passive enhancements of +1 HP per tick while feigned.]</i></font> <br><br>This also makes sense to me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Skill Caps.<br>Kick caps at 250.

In the monk community this is refered often to as the "frenzy code". When a mob decides that they are going to kill you, they will kill you regardless. I personally have had times where I fd 8 or 9 times successfully in a row, but still have the mob continue to beat on me.

Once the last robe is obtained, three groups can do all four of the battles needed to get the fists, and none of the mobs are rare spawns.
