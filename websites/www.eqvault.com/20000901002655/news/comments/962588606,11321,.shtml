You're just attempting to make them look bad by fabricating a bunch of things Verant never said.  As for this one, &quot;We are the best game out there, and if you don't like it you don't have to play any games.&quot; thats not even proper english.  There's no way would a Verant employee say these things.  Period.  Don't believe him, he's lying.  They work hard on this game, and it is the best of it's kind out there.  This company that Rupert is talking about will have the same EXACT problems.  Balance isn't the easiest thing to come by, and people WILL complain about it.  But hey.. would you rather have a game that would be incredibly boring just so that you can say &quot;Look what I can do!  I can kill a dragon alone!&quot;  Yeah.. that'll make people proud.<br><br>Jaeron -Shadowstalker, Merc for Hire, at your service.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email cralis@home.com end_email start_name Rupert end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->#5 yes, in fact all of those quotes are. I have been toying with wasting some free time after I go to Origins and compiling a list of them and links to their locations so I can satisfy someone who refuses to believe someone from Verant could say something like that.<br><br>#6 Already quit, did that long ago. I've continuously said that I refuse to support the developers. My gripe is how they are negatively affecting the industry and it really sucks.<br><br>#7 Most of those quotes are _exact_. The one I remember best was Gordon's response about the upper areas of the plane of sky, and he said &quot;We didn't test it because we didn't think you could get that high until the Ruins of Kunark was released.&quot;<br><br>He was specifically refering to that because he didn't think a group of level 50 (remember until ROK came out nobody could go over level 50) people could make it to where they did, and Verant didn't test the last half of the plane of sky until they made it.<br><br>Remember that neato 150 damage 15 delay 2h paladin sword that was a mistake? That was part of it.<br><br>#8 I think your right, but my experience is different. When I got the game I was one of those people with the weird SB16 bugs that crashed me 3-5 times a day. For 4 months I sent a /feedback 3-5 times a day stating that I once again crashed and that if they wanted me to stop sending these feedbacks to email me. Nobody ever emailed me. I probably sent (4*30=120, 120*4feedbacks=480 feedbacks)averaged over the course of that time.<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Look, I realize that this game is THEIRS - they own it, so they can do whatever they want; but I just wish they would tell the truth. If you say you are going to do X then do Y, people are going to starting realizing that you are doing nothing but lying and blowing smoke up their asses. I have figured it out: Verant=lawyers=politicians. Let us just look at one example of Verant and their wonderful, hypocrtical, two-faced lying -- Said that they were taking the online store down to fix all of the problems they had (and lord knows they had a huge number of problems); but that it wouldn't take long --&gt; REALITY: it came donw THE DAY Kunark went retail and is STILL NOT BACK. Why didn't they just say the truth - Hey, if you do not order the upgrade before it goes retail, then you will have to buy the entire thing to get kunark instead of the lying bullshit about we are just pulling it until we fix it - Hey, I may not be the smartest person; but it doesn't take a company THREE MONTHS to fix an online ordering system - sites come up everyday on the web that have online ordering. <br>Personally, I am simply waiting for Gordon to leave Verant and join one fo the presidental campaigns as a press spokesman cause he and the rest of Verant are even better than some of those guys at lying with a straight face ... maybe they could make some extra money by teaching classes to the politicians in DC<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email listen_before_you_speak@hotmail.com end_email start_name listen_before_you_speak end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Hey Jaeron (ie #5) --- Hey grow the hell up and do as my name says: LISTEN_BEFORE_YOU_SPEAK. Those statements in quotes: 90% of them are real statements from Verant employees - if you had been reading the boards, you would have known this.<br> It amazes me that there are actually people out there who think that we are making this stuff up. Hell, I have been playing EQ since it first came out, not beta, so almost a year and a half. I did not realize that there were any kind of boards on the internet until I had been playing for over 4 months. I was already a little dissillusioned with EQ and the fact that I never got any responses from Verant for any problems I had (oh and unlike like you and your type - no flames just feedback, bug, etc.). Once I found the boards, I started realizing that my reaction to Verant's PISS-POOR customer service was the same for most everyone else.<br> I have always been known by my customers for having great customer service, which is why when I left my last job as a Network technician, a good number of my clients convinced me to start my own company - because they couldn't get the customer service from the company I left or anywhere else.  I know for a fact that if I treated my customers the way that Verant treats theirs, I would be without any customers and totally broke.<br> Some people say if you do not like EQ then go play something else.<br> Well, the problem is that 1. there is really nothing else out there YET (please come on ShadowBane, etc. - UO sucks with bad gameplay and bad customer service - and Asheron's Call ... damn are they still going? man, Microsoft has deep pockets and is too stupid to know when to quit); and 2. Once you spend a large amount of time building up your characters, you really hate to just throw them away.<br>  Most people feel that when they spend THEIR money and time on something that they should have a little say in things. Now, I realize that for every one normal, sane, honest, caring person, that there are probably two goobers out there (just seems that way - try Lake Rathe zone on Veeshan at 9 pm for last two weeks - the biggest bunch of children running around cursing, deriding each other with the shout command -&gt; no GM ever stops it, by the way. However, some of us are simply trying to get the true problems with the game changed so that it can become even better. It has become apparent to me that no matter what is said, Verant will not do anything and my post above reaffirms this. Instead of simply telling the truth and saying &quot;Hey, everyone, this is how it is going to be.&quot;, they lie and double talk, etc. As a &quot;wise old sage&quot; once said: &quot;Don't piss on my shoe and tell me it's raining.&quot;<br> That being said, I am about to sell my accounts (yes, I have TWO: my original and then a friend's who could not afford his after a couple of months but didn't want ot lose his characters - so I took it over until he could pay; however he got disillusioned with Verant also and quit).<br>  &lt;sigh&gt; <br> To me, it is simply so sad that Verant is killing themselves and their once pretty good game. EQ could be something totally awesome.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Verant doesn't have the proper resources to monitor the /bug or /feedback queue.  Verant also doesn't have the proper resources to test things properly.<br><br>Complaining about it will get no changes in EQ.  Verant has already chosen the level of support they are willing to commit to EQ.  As long as new people sign up faster that others quit, Verant will judge what it has done as a success.<br><br>As long as people complain, but keep paying, Verant will stay the same.

I have not, do not, and will not...whine. <br><br>I present information, facts, and opinions. I have not wavered in my stance, and I do not insist on Verant changing the game to the way I like it. In none of my statements will you find me: whining because the game didn't go my way, whining because I haven't made the next level, or whining because class A got something that mine didn't.<br><br>Needless to say I do not whine. I have legitimate arguements perhaps, maybe a few complaints, and I certainly go out of my way to prove my points, but I do not &quot;whine&quot;.<br><br>How do I know? Read the dictionary sometime:<br><br>Whine (hwin, win) vi. whined, whin'ing [[ ME whinen &lt; OE hwinan, akin to ON hvina &lt; IE base *kewi-, to whiz, hiss &gt; WHISTLE, WHISPER ]] 1. a) to utter a peevish, high-pitched, somewhat nasal sound, as in complaint, distress, or fear b) to make a prolonged, high-pitched cound like this 2. to complain or beg in a childishly undignified way, as with a whine - vt. to utter with or as a whine - n. 1. the act or sound of whining 2. a complaint uttered in a whining tone - whin'|er n. - whin'ing|ly adv.<br><br>Obviously it doesn't take much brainpower to determine that a lot of the &quot;chatter&quot; on these boards is not whining. But I will agree a lot of it is. I assume your fairly intelligent (you had the power to quit UO after all), so I'm sure you can agree that while you may not agree with me, I certainly do not fall into that category. There is &quot;meat&quot; in my arguements so-to-speak.<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

What I mean by that is that Verant does not have an established and automatic method of handling their development, so a lot of useful things get pushed on the way side because they are too hard to utilize without process.<br><br>The feedback, bug, and test reports are good examples of this. With efficient process you'd be able to have a person (or the right person) be able to quickly and efficiently search through the reports for information. Some companies have a single person who does nothing but categorize this information so the designers and programmers can simply wade through it. Even better, this person often finds new reports and prioritizes them so they can be acted upon.<br><br>We know this works because Asheron's Call and Allegiance do just that. But of course they have one of the most efficient processes behind them - one of the few really good things Microsoft has ever developed.<br><br>In any case Verant has little or no process, and these reports are probably all assembled on some computer somewhere that has an automatic delete sequence for old reports. Thats about the extend of their process.<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

There are also a lot of half-done fixes put into the game (examine Alchemy's progression over the course of the game, for example).<br><br>Alot of people I know, including myself, enjoy the game.  However, we also feel that we are Beta Testing EQ, rather than playing on a finished product.  If my car had as many problems as EQ does, then I'd certainly have the right to sue the manufacturer of my vehicle.  (And yeah, I realize that it's taken decades to get auto's to where they are today, it's an example)<br><br>My single biggest complaint with EQ is customer support.  Everquest lacks the required number of employees to keep up with the players wants and demands.  And wants and demands are what should be addressed in a service industry such as what we are dealing with in EQ.<br><br>Everquest's lack of Customer Support falls into two basic categories as I see it:<br><br>1)  Lack of number of employees.  There simply aren't ever enough GM's to handle customer complaints.  There aren't enough builders to keep zones pumping out to deal with the growing populations.  There aren't enough code-enabled testers (I/E those who see all of the actual effects, and don't have to rely on information gained through scientific method.)  There certainly isn't a head person for each class, as there should be in order to promote class balance.  An example of this would be to compare the Necromancer to....just about any class you can think of.  None stand up to it in sheer power.  (let's not turn this into an anti-necro bash, please)<br><br>2)  Communication.  I firmly believe that GW wants to make all of the promises he makes to the players come true.  However, I'm sure he gets several hundred requests a day, and must therefore pick out of that number which will be shown to the appropriate division.  So, I don't doubt that many could be forgotten or overlooked.  It's sad, however, that he hasn't come up with a better way of remembering what to tell them (like....writing it down)<br><br>Graack, Shaman of Xegony<br>&quot;For Halas!

You guys have the perfect answers to anyone who complains.  If they're still playing EQ and complaining, they're stupid for continuing to pay for something they don't like.  If they don't play EQ, and complain, you flame them for that.<br><br>Me?  Personally, I quit long ago.  I just wandered by while the D2 servers are down.  :)  The single day that ended my beliefs in EQ was that after months and months and months (what was it, 9?) of saying &quot;there's nothing wrong with alchemy&quot; &quot;skill gain for alchemy works right&quot; &quot;we've checked the code, it's all correct here&quot; (yes, they DID say that) &quot;What are you guys complaining about, alchemy works fine&quot;....<br><br>... they finally actually looked, and noticed it was broken.<br><br>How can you trust a company that for months claims that you're wrong, that they know what they're talking about, only to have them later admit that they lied about actually checking things, and things really ARE broken.<br><br>Another example:  Hell levels.  Verant says they play their guys up normally, and have gotten to level 50, but they didn't know about the hell levels for quite some time.  Anyone who's played through 'em knows about 'em.  :P<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

The whole point is that NONE of this companies can program, they all have problems, but EQ is the best at ignoring the players. Someday this will all change.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email cralis@home.com end_email start_name Rupert end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->#18: I will do just that, but unfortunately your going to have to wait until the last week of July. I have business at Origins this year (thats right, I'm a developer) and I don't have time to search FTP archives, message board archives, and news archives for these quotes.<br><br>PS. I heard you the first time. I'd imagine you posted twice because you love to see your own type.<br><br>#23: Asheron's Call was built that way on purpose. The designer have stated over and over again that they wanted to prove they could build a completely new fantasy universe with none of the traditional &quot;things&quot; you would find in a fantasy game. To that end they have succeeded brilliantly. True, a lot of people don't want to play a non-traditional fantasy game, but that doesn't mean they are &quot;stupid&quot;.<br><br>Further, AC is expanding the game in a very planned fashion. They didn't add banks because it is supposed to be a &quot;frontier society&quot;. Of course at the beginning you couldn't start any race in any city, but now you can because they figure diversity has set in. Likewise they are adding banks now because the &quot;economy&quot; is settling in place as well.<br><br>I'd also like to point out that Turbine has a tremendous amount of talent and process. With nearly a third the personal that EQ has, they not only manage to fix bugs and add new features, but also build new parts to the world and hold world-wide events every month, AND build AC2. Kinda makes Verant look silly with all their people and they have a hard time fixing a database entry to allow a spell they promised months ago.<br><br>#20: Your exactly right. Thats why I don't pay them my ten dollars. In fact that is 90% of the reason I quit. I was a rogue. 'nuff said.<br><br>LAST: I cannot stress it enough - I don't believe Verant is underpowered. I believe that they have such a tremendous lack of process that they waste a lot of the manpower they possess. Sheesh, they have 3 facilities with at least 30-50 people in each one!! <br><br>Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

As for customer service taking too long to answer your call, use some common sense.  If too many people call, should they hang up on everyone so that they can get to your call now?  Uh.. be real please.  And same for GM's.  There are what.. 3 on at peak time?  If you're complaining it could take a couple hours for help, you're right.. it could.. because there are 1500 average people all petitioning stupid things like &quot;Where is crushbone?&quot; because they don't know what petition is supposed to be used for.  And the policy is to respond to every petition, even if it's one that isn't going to be answered.  So that sounds like a damn good customer relations thing to me.  And for anyone who thinks they can do it better, including anyone who works on AC or UO *cough*, why aren't you doing so much better then?  Last I checked, EQ blew you out the water.  Thought so.  Oh and alchemy, no one is perfect.  They publicly apologized, and said they were testing other aspects of the code and never realized what was broken about it.  Mostly because when people complained for the most part, it was something like this.  &quot;ALCHEMY IS STILL BROKEN IT NEEDS FIX SO FIX IT NOW ITS BROKEN FIX!&quot;  Then there would be a response like &quot;We've tested alchemy, and found it to be working fine.&quot;  Then someone would post on the thread later what was broken about it.  And it's my belief, (Wrong or not) that they only read a thread till it's responded to.  And I can't think of one time there was two responses on one thread, so.. oh well.  Bottom line of this post, it looks to me like you're one of those people.. you know the kind.. like if you worked for Ford, and you said that Chevy cars are made to break down in 3 years exactly so you should only buy Ford products, but can't back it up cause you're too &quot;busy&quot;.  If you were that busy, you wouldn't be reading the boards for hours a day.<br>Jaeron -Shadowstalker, Merc for Hire, at your service.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Words twisted around and manipulated to make it appear as if Verant hates their customer base (or at least holds a disdain for it) does not constitute a logical and fact based argument for what's wrong with EQ.  Period.<br><br>  Yes, there are problems with EQ.  After all, we are in a sub-genre (can't come up with a better term) of the computer gaming industry that has been in existence for all of about 3(?) years.  [If you don't count MUDs, etc]  Do you expect it to be flawless?  I don't.  Coming here and blasting Verant on every thread does nothing but waste bandwidth and make things miserable for those of us who would like to hold some sort of rational discussion on the issues.<br><br>  Lastly, I don't work for Verant, and I don't think anyone else posting in this thread so far does.  So then, who are we to claim to know whether or not Verant has &quot;process&quot; or what goes on there?  Do we _really_ have any knowledge of what Verant's internal development processes are?  No, we don't and no one here should pretend to have that knowledge either.<br><br><br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

Read - actually READ - the responses from Verant. It is obvious that they do not have very good code control, test/QA control, or design control, and they totally lack any other kind of process.<br><br>Worse, they think they are the best people in the software industry and that produces their &quot;not gonna change&quot; attitude and their god-like &quot;we own you&quot; attitude. <br><br>Now you can disagree with me all-you-want, but it will not change the _FACTS_.<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name BooMan end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Firstly, I'll have to agree to disagree with you concerning Verant's attitude towards us.  I just am not seeing the same thing you are.  Maybe it just doesn't make sense to me, considering we're putting food on their table. <br><br>I have read your posts.  The more I read them, the more I understand them, and I'm coming to the conclusion that you're misdirecting your anger.  Since UO is (arguably) the lead service in this portion of the industry, I think it can be said that Verant is in uncharted territory (MMORPG's).  When charting new territory, you have to allow a period of time for discovery purposes.  Creating a MMORPG isn't like building a car.  Everyone knows the critical components needed to build a car and the processes have already been finely tuned.  Not so with MMORPG's.<br><br>Furthermore, MMORPG's have to be able to accomodate and handle the unpredictability of human behavior and decision making.  Perhaps someone could point out a finely tuned process for dealing with this?<br><br>So because EQ (for example) is still in this &quot;period of discovery&quot; we should slam them, and assume they don't have processes in place?  That doesn't make sense to me.  Again, we can take Verant's responses and manipulate them to &quot;prove&quot; that they have no process, but with no inside knowledge of Verant's workings, we are only guessing.<br><br>One could make the argument that the amount of time MMORPG's have existed should be plenty of time to develop process, but I disagree.  I think EQ, UO, etc should be well down that road (I believe they are... well... not so sure about UO) but discovery is a long process when you're dealing with a new territory that is so dependent on human behavior.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I generally enjoy Eq but I am not going to make excuses for their mistakes. You bring up Alchemy. I was in Beta 3 and it was broken then. And yes, people were specific about how it was broken. And a year later they finally get it fixed? (Maybe) There is somethign wrong inside Verant. There are far too many issues still hanging in the balance.<br><br>I think you need to step back from EQ and try to be more objective. I play the game but don't enjoy alot of the problems that are brought up. And yes I will leave someday. Isn't that what all you anti-whiners say. If you don't like it leave? I will leave when I am ready. I will continue pointing out faults with the game that should have been fixed before it went retail.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email cralis@home.com end_email start_name Rupert end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Booman, I will have to disagree with you. <br><br>EQ is not so much in &quot;discovery&quot; as it is simply an extension of where UO went. MMPOG gaming is nothing new, and if you count MUDs has been around since the 70's. There are COUNTLESS lessons to be learned from the MUDs that the MMPOG game developers have not bothered to learn.<br><br>Second, I'm not against &quot;discovery&quot; but rather the lack-luster attitude they hold. They have something like 20-30 people working on EQ yet they seem to be hardpressed to make a major change only once a quarter, and have problems making minor changes every month? AC does BOTH every single month and they have half the people.<br><br>Last, the alchemy thing keeps getting brought up because Verant doesn't do two things: thank the people who report problems (usually they ban them for proving the bugs exist), and then apologize when they've been blatantly wrong and accusing the players of being wrong.<br><br>Last, I think Gordon summed it up great about a month or two ago when he said &quot;Don't forget that your in OUR world now.&quot; True, they need to watch out for the game and do the developer things, but they take that a step further with the attitude of &quot;we let you play in our world only because you pay us for that privelage&quot;. Thats the wrong attitude to take.<br><br>But we can argue over this day and night and not get anywhere. You see something different when you see these statements, and I'd even guess that when you see the ones that I've quoted you don't see the errors that I see. Thats fine, and I wish you the best of luck while your enjoying the game. But do understand that some of us have gotten past that point, and when you get there you can be sure we won't hold it against you.<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process.
