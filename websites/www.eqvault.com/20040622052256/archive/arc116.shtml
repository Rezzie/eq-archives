Back on the Gameplay Board, Verant's Gordon Wrinn was busy creating more posts.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040247.html"><b>Paladin Spell Quest</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: A while back i heard of a Paladin only spell available at 49. Is this quest broken?]</i><P> No, not broken, it just isn't in yet. I don't have an ETA, but June is looking good.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040250.html"><b>Paladin Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1. The paladin quest spell. All we want to know is why its not in the game yet.]</i><P> The quest isn't done yet, and I apologize that I don't have an ETA. June is probably a good bet, as the Live team is going to take some time off after getting Kunark fires put out. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 2. The lvl 55 spell you said you would report back to us on but havent.]</i><P> The spell and scroll are in there. Paladins should check the cleric guild.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040229.html"><b>Funny Thing on eBay</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I saw this on Ebay and couldn't help but LMAO. This person actually thinks this little paragraph of legal looking talk will make it ok for them to sell on ebay. <P>Tunare Everquest Goblin Two Hand Sword<P>Even tough its name is Two Hand Sword is actually a 1H slash weapon. It gives some of the best stats you will find on a 1H slash weapon as well. <P>By bidding on this auction you verify that you are not an employee of, nor a relative of an employee of, Sony or Verant. Furthurmore you verify that you are bidding with the sole intention of trading the sum of 1CP for the item listed. You have no other intentions including,but not limited to, determining station names, determining character names, and providing Verant, Sony, or any other person or entity any information whatsoever. I can traval anywhere in Norrath to make this trade. I will accept Visa and Mastercard through Paypal. I will also accept Checks and Money Orders as payment. Good luck on the bidding.]</i><P>This is pretty funny. I hope that people realize that we will employ common-sense in any enforcement. If you are selling the items, then you are selling the items, and efforts to invoke technicalities really won't impact our decision.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040164.html"><b>Level 54 Wizard Spell Voltaic Draught Broken?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: To put it simply Votaic Draught does the EXACT same thing as the lvl 51 spell Draught of Fire. Same damage, same mana, same casting time. I am assuming this is broken because what would be the point of going through 3 major hell levels for no spell progression?]</i><P> This isn't a bug. The intent was to provide wizards with some fast-casting medium damage spells versus all of the saves. Please keep in mind that the levels from 50-60 do not so much represent an increase in power for casters, but them becoming more well-rounded. </UL>

Experience in groups was the subject of a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037835-2.html">recent response</a> Gordon Wrinn posted on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the post:<UL><I>There seem to be a couple of issues here in the thread, the first being linking groups for shared experience, and the second being linking groups for enhanced communication. In both of these cases, we've weighed the various pros and cons of each situation and decided against them.<br>Linking groups for shared experience isn't feasible from a technical standpoint. The code that determines how experience is split up, and the group tracking mechanisms in game are part of the central core of EverQuest, something that we would rather leave intact and instead focus our time on adding new content to the game. <br><br>Shared communication has been ruled out both for that reason (though communication would probably be easier), and to increase the challenge of encounters that require multiple groups. One thing that is difficult about these encounters is that communication is difficult, where it should be. You have 30 people in a room all going after the same critter, and it takes real skill to keep everything sorted out, even with everything filtered out via the chat filters. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Gordon split the original VenrilSathir Faction in Kunark Dungeons thread into a new one on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the first post in this <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040260.html">new thread</a>:<UL><I>The original thread is at:<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039204.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039204.html</a><br><br>if anyone would like to review it.<br><br>We've discussed the issue again internally and the VenrilSathir faction in some of the Kunark dungeons and the evil outpost are there to stay. The factions as they are set up are important to the storyline in Kunark.<br><br>We did make a mistake however in putting guildmasters and bankers in the outpost, as it gave a lot of people the impression that Kunark was their new home and was a place that they would never have to leave. We probably won't remove the guildmasters and bankers, but won't rule that out completely just yet. <br><br>We are considering putting the aggressive stuff on a lesser associated faction so it won't hurt as much when people have to kill them from time to time. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Here's the second post in this thread:<UL>I've found nothing but outdoor dungoens (with inferior loot) to hunt in besides City of Mist so far. All of the major Dungeons in Kunark are now off limits to me<br><br><b><i>That simply isn't the case. You might want to look around a bit more. You also mentioned that you play a dark elf wizard, how is this any different than hunting in Faydwer and porting back to Nek to bank and buy goods?</b></i></UL>Here's the third post:<UL>Verant - without altering your precious storyline you could put a small band of evil gypsies somewhere in Kunark who hate most good races but will offer up supplies and banking to the evils, albeit perhaps at elevated prices<br><br><b><i>Well we are planning on putting in some Iksar carpetbaggers looking to make a quick buck off of the invading forces, but they most likely won't allow banking, just merchant services.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

A place called w00t.org has kicked up <a href="http://www.w00t.org/archive/reviews/eq_rok/eq_rok.php3">another review of Kunark</a> giving it a score of 4/5.  Here's an excerpt for those interested:<UL>I installed RoK which took about 15 minutes and then had to download massive amounts of patches for it which took about an hour on my 56k. When I finally got into the game I logged onto my server and had to choose from an Iksar Necromancer, Warrior, Shadow knight, Monk or Shaman. I chose Necromancer knowing that they were fun to play and the thought of an Iksar wearing a robe just seemed very cool to me.</UL>Thanks Malak!

Gordon made a few posts this afternoon on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the lowdown:<uL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039653-3.html"><b>Level 51+ Spells Not Dropping?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why isn't Abashi replying?]</i><P> Because either I or Aradune has replied to several other threads. With 40 threads liable to pop up on any given subject, we usually don't copy/paste our replies to each one. <P>The original author is incorrect in his assertion that "Across ALL servers, not ONE level 51 - 59 spell has been dropped. Not ONE, not even ONE, ZERO spells have been dropped. Zilch, zip, nada, nothing." <P>They are dropping.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040144.html"><b>How long was Kunark beta tested?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: How long was Kunark beta tested? Why is there a test server? What purpose is a test server when you don't test things or the things you do test still end up "wrong"?]</i><P> I'm sorry, but it happens. It is true that a hundred-thousand people can find more problems in less time than 500 external testers, and that's the easiest way to explain it. There are certain things that testers won't do that live customers will. As much as we'd like to have everything 100% perfect 100% of the time, it's probably not a realistic goal that can hold up to having 200K separate personalities thrown at it.<br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: Why did you answer someone who posted to my post and not address any of the questions I asked? That wasn't very nice. Sorry, not a flame, I am usually your fan...]</i><P>  His quote was the most concise one in the thread that basically asked the same questions as yours. There were some problems with the loot that was dropping and we needed to fix them. <br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: I don't like the fact that it was NERFED.  I don't like the fact that stuff of Kunark mobs (not in dungeons) is better than most planes gear.]</i><P> Don't these two quotes contradict each other? You don't like that some of the stuff is better than planar stuff, yet you don't like that the drops were nerfed. <P><i>[Quote from original post: If they were to revert to the pre-Kunark nerf stage for 2 months, I guarantee that many of the problems that have popped up as the result of player interaction will slowly dissipate. However, I can guarantee they won't because they are afraid at a little experimentation.]</i><P>  We had god items dropping off of level 40 outdoor critters. It had to be fixed, and no, we won't purposely reintroduce the problems to "experiment". We don't have the option of doing a P-wipe in two months when it becomes obvious that the entire game economy is broken, so no, we won't take that chance. What would be the benefit of doing this? Player satisifaction? Players would be satisified in the short term just by virtue of getting a bunch of cool stuff that they couldn't normally get. However in the long term they would get bored, since there would be nothing left with any meaning for them to acquire.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040224.html"><b>"Why Verant Doesn't Want You to Enjoy EQ"</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Verant has losts its vision. It feels that EQ has made a big impression on the MMPUG market and if they can just keep its customers happy long enough for them to get Star Wars up and running then most of their customer base will leave EQ and jump right into Star Wars.]</i><P> Completely incorrect. Though there will surely be some crossover, it wouldn't be entirely smart of us to purposely plan on stealing our current customer base in order to populate another game. <P><i>[Quote from original post: I know without a shadow of a doubt that they only care about the Bottom Line and not their customer base.]</i><P> The customer base is our bottom line. We can't care about one without caring about the other. <P><i>[Quote from original post: caters to a small minority of players]</i><P> Actually no, we're constantly faced with having to tell a small minority of the players "no" in order to maintain the integrity of the game for the majority. <P><i>[Quote from original post: You see, Verant has its vision wrong, they should be doing everything possible to upgrade this game as fast as possible, improve their internet link, reevaluate their decisions on factions, class limitations and caps, the difficulty of mobs, and the casual players.]</i><P> Though we welcome your opinion, this is where we'll have to disagree. The majority of the players do not want us making vast sweeping changes to the game. They want the game to remain essentially the same, with improvements. You seem to be advocating completely overhauling the game. Why would we want to risk upsetting the majority by doing this? <P><i>[Quote from original post: I love playing EQ]</i><P> And you are obviously very passionate about it. I with there was something I could do to help you understand our views.</UL>

Here's a clip of Milo giving a player advice about love in this edition:<UL><I>Sorry for going into Dr. Laura Schlessigner/Yoda mode, there, but having been burned a lot by women (probably mostly my fault, for being such a ridiculous perfectionist), I hate to see it happen to anyone else! As Brad McQuaid himself once expressed to me shortly before he realized that the woman who would eventually become his wife actually did love him, unrequited love is pure hell, plain and simple. In my opinion, nothing can kill a man with greater efficiency and conclusiveness.</I></UL>For the rest check the link provided in the above.

The article begins on this note:<UL>One minute your looking at three games: Everquest, Asheron's call and Ultima Online. Now, its RTS phenomena all over again, but this is much more dangerous for the un-weary developer. Warcraft II and Command & Conquer was released and soon followed by legions of piss poor clones trying to ride the coattails of their success. How many of the games actually succeeded financially? Age of Empires and Total Annihilation come to mind and of course Starcraft and the C&C sequels did well. That leaves dozens of games that bombed horribly. </UL>Use the link above to find the rest.

From Aracnakat:<BLOCKQUOTE>New Wizard Portal Found:<br> <br>Rumors are pouring in about a new wizard portal spotted in the desert city of Las Vegas.  Scholars all over Norrath are going crazy trying to figure out the correct spell components to use this portal.<br> <br>Investigators have spoken to the local peasants regarding this new find and have found that they refer to it as the Luxor Hotel.  Although the locals have no idea of the magical significants of this find, they have stated that they often hear screams and cheers emitting from inside of it.<br> <br>So far a few things have been concluded.  Norrathian scholars believe that you must take an Air-O-Plane to get there.  They have further concluded that Air-O-Planes can be constructed by tinkers of the highest skill level.  These tinkers must be at the Air-O-Port which is believed to be somewhere in the Plane of Sky.  (More on this as investigations continue.)<br> <br>On July 7th & 8th, 2000 a group of scholars, fanatics, and drunkards from the Cazic-Thule server will be traveling to this city to investigate this new Wizard Portal.  All are invited to attend this momentous occasion as we crack the riddle of this ancient portal.<br> <br>On July 7th there will be much eating, drinking and celebrating our arrival.  On July 8th there will be much eating, drinking and celebrating our findings.

While we cannot, of course, make everyone happy all of the time, we continue to do our best and the sales and subscriptions continue to let us know we made a game that a lot of people seriously enjoy. <br><br>What can customers look forward to? More. More of what makes EQ great, and more adjustments and refinements to make it even greater.

A question asking <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039915.html">why Frogloks are in Kunark</a> was answered today by Brad McQuaid on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the dirt:<UL><i>2 resons, really.<br><br>1. We wanted to nice mix of old and new models in the Expansion -- blending familiarity and newness has always been key to EQ (including the setting, the creatures, etc.)<br><br>2. There's always finite time in creating a product. Would I like a new froglok model like there's a new goblin model? Sure! Heck, I'd like there to be tons more models... but one has to draw the line somewhere in terms of how much content you can get into a game in so much time.<br><br>Overall, I'm very proud of how many distinct models are in EQ, both in the original release and in the Expansion -- I don't think any other 3D game even comes close to the variety we have. The EQ character model team has a LOT to be proud of.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

We have tuning meetings where game designers, programmers, and other interested parties participate in debating current issues, coming up with new ideas, and deciding in general where things should go.<br><br>Smed rarely if ever gets involved in in-game issues.<br><br>For a long time I moderated and led the tuning meetings, but that is done primarily by the Producer of the EQ Live team now.<br><br>In any case, we are a team, and we collectively make decisions and preserve and protect the Vision(TM).

Brad <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039734.html">posted to the Gameplay Board</a> giving us an update to the Plane Clipping problem that's been around for a while.  Here's his post:<UL><i>We're still trying to isolate the problem.<br>We've not been able to reproduce it in-house.<br><br>We are trying to see if it's related to certain video cards, but have yet to see a pattern.<br><br>Here's how the clipping plane works in EQ:<br><br>Each zone has information about it in a 'Zone Header' -- this includes the type of zone, the name of the zone, the chance of rain/snow, etc. It also includes a min and max view distance (clip distance).<br><br>Your clipping plane slider bar works on a percentage basis. So, let's say you have it set in the middle, approximately at 50%. One zone might have a min of 500 and a max of 1000 feet viewable distance. In that zone, you'd see 750 feet. Another zone, however, might have a min of 500 and a max of 1500, in which case you'd be seeing 1000 feet unless you adjusted the slider.<br><br>There are two factors related to how we set the maximum distance: 1. ambiance and 2. how the zone was created. Some zones, for example fog enshrouded forests, have a max clip purposely set lower for effect. Most zones, however, have the max very close to the drawing distance set by the zone creator when he exported the zone. In other words, if we set it any higher you'd see visual anomolies or simply not see the world at all.<br><br>In any case, you should see some change when you adjust your slider. The more variance between the min and max, the more variance you'll see.<br><br>We will continue to try to isolate why there are some reports that the final 25% to 50% of moving the slider does nothing.<br><br>-Brad</I></uL>

Azarr Windtree brings us the following announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail and Well meet fellow Norrathians,<br><br>Allow me to introduce myself I am Azarr Windtree Mage of the Mysts and <br>member of the Great Atani Guild. I come here to inform you all of a great <br>saga just begone. The saga began one night hence as I traveled through West <br>Freeport, I happened apon a small band of my fellow Atani at the Theatre who <br>sat quitely listening to a man named Hicor, so being the curious mage I am, <br>I to stopped to listen to the Hicor's tale. He spoke of his friend Nyplid, <br>who on the very day of his wedding had been manhandled and spirited away. <br>Nicor told of how he had investigated Nyplid's disapearence. His <br>investigation had of course begone were Nyplid had last been seen and soon <br>came to believe that the dark races of Norrath may of had something to do <br>with Nyplid's disapearence. Though he found no strong clues he did find a <br>note posted in one of the local taverns that spoke of a Shadow from another <br>realm. The Shadow could not come into our realm nor could he take a person <br>from this realm to his. Yet the Shadow had followers here in Norrath, ones <br>of the dark races. Two of which the names are known, Drodak a Troll and <br>Androdameia a Shdowknight. Turning up know other clues, Nicor decided to <br>investagate the sewers of Freeport as it is rumored that the dark races <br>inhabit them at times. Nicor said he began his search in the sewers and came <br>apon a Darkelf, but though questions many times the Darkelf only ignored <br>Nicor. After more investigation of the sewers he had come apon a piece of <br>tatered cloth, the cloth had strange symbols as some sort of writing. He <br>himself could not translate it to the fullest yet know that the cloth had <br>something to do with the Shadow.<br><br>We had all sat quitely listening to the occurance of poor Nyplid's <br>kidnapping and of the search for him when Hicor asked that who among us <br>would help to locate Nyplid and return him safely home. Out of the Atani <br>that were assembled there four responed I being one of them. The others were <br>Granaut A dwarven cleric who liked his ale, Nacacia a halfelf rogue, whos <br>bueaty hides her deadly skills, and lastly Lowelf a druid, a blessing to <br>know. After the four agreed to help, Hicor handed me the tatered cloth and <br>told us to seek out a friend in Felwithe named Delcaraa, but that she might <br>be hard to see as her mother was sick and that she had left her post as <br>Cleric for the fireworks company Kaboom to tend to her, but we might seek <br>out Cahboom who also worked for the comapny and he might aid us to find <br>Delacaraa. Hicor did warn us not to let Cahboom see the Cloth as he would <br>destroy it, why I am not sure. Hicor then left after thanking us for the <br>help we offered. The four of us sat a moment and talking about what to do I, <br>Nacacia and Granaut decided to set sail on the next boat that left for <br>Faydwer. Lowelf decided he would go alone, as most druid seem to be loners <br>most of the time, but he would keep us informed if he found out anything. We <br>arrived shortly at Faydwer and headed to Felwithe, at the great wizard <br>spires we meet the Gnome Kahboom who was interested in hiring our dwarven <br>cleric friend as a replacement for Delcaraa until she could return to work, <br>of which Granaut agreed, "so if by chance you are in Faydwer and here a loud <br>boom know that Dwarven ale and fireworks do not mix well." After talking to <br>Cahboom he agreed to lead us to were Delcaraa lived, apon ariving and <br>introducing our selves she asked that the others leave and of course I asked <br>that Cahboom leave as well so that we could talk in private, but unknown to <br>Delcaraa, Nacacia had used your stealth to sneak back in. I then took out <br>the tatered cloth from my backpack and showed it to Delacaraa, she stood <br>back in amazment. Asked if she might have the cloth to investigate it. I <br>agreed, she took the cloth and said that it would take at least a week befor <br>she could tell me more of what it was and perhaps how it fit into Nyplids <br>disapearence. We left her to her studies "I was thankful to get rid of that <br>piece of cloth if made me fell very uneasy holding on to it."<br><br>Knowing how well my drawven friend likes his ale we decided to head to the <br>local tavern in Felwithe for a few rounds and some discussion of the events. <br>We all drank to the day and to the hopefully safe return of Nyplid, not <br>knowing what the future would hold. We all agreed on meeting one week hence <br>to find out what Delacaraa had to say. I look forward to what lies ahead.<br><br>Azarr Windtree<br>Mage of the Mysts Azarr Windtree<br>Atani - <A HREF="http://www.atani.com">http://www.atani.com</A></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon replied to the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039688.html">following post</a> on the Gameplay Board regarding a bug with one of the Rogue's new weapons:<UL>I finally got what turns out to be an extremly nice rogue dagger (locustous *spelling sorry*) 8 damage 17 dealy with Effect: walking sleep (level 5ish shaman). Now I was thrilled that my friend actually got this for me. I couldnt wait to try it out. OMG...... I was imediately told to put it away by the shaman and enchanter in my group. It cancles there high level tugurs/slow spells. Since when can a level 5 spell cancle a level 40+ or higher spell out. So basially since most groups i get in either have a shaman or enchanter in them ill never be able to use this weapon. Well there is the off chance that I might just go out soloing with it (not). Please if you could either put a different effect on this weapon, take the effect away, or make it so the effect doesnt write over the higher level spells.<br><br><b><i>We've acknowleded the bug. The spell supercedence rules try to figure out what spell is "better" and causes it to overwrite the inferior spell. It assumes that "higher values" = "better". The attack speed debuffs are the only spell where lesser values in the database yields a better spell. <br><br>It's on our list, but I don't have an ETA.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

GameOver has kicked up <a href="http://www.game-over.net/review/may2000/kunark/">another review of Kunark</a> awarding the expansion an 86% rating.  The review also comes with some nifty screenshots.  Here's a quote:<UL>The Ruins of Kunark does exactly what an expansion pack should do. It expands on the experience known as EverQuest and improves it at the same time. Graphically, the new zones look better. Combine that with the addition of a new race, a new continent, the change from level 50 to level 60 characters, new items, spells and creatures and you've basically got a fantastic addition that is a must for EverQuest adventurers. </UL>Use the link above to read the rest.

Gordon made two more posts this evening on the Gameplay Board.  The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038211.html">first post</a> talks about his Wizard character:<UL><i>The "Abashi" character is an Erudite wizard, and has been since inception, except for a short stint as a gnomish enchanter between Beta2 and Beta3. <br><br>I haven't had a wizard as a play-character since beta .5 - beta1 when I built one to level 12, then changed to a different class because there were no more spells available.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039635.html">second post</a> about the Shrink spell:<UL>(not the ants potion...which is same as shrink spell and only works in dungeons). I'd like to clarify something: <br><br><b><i>That sounds like a bug, as the potion version was supposed to be "Shrink Everywhere". Someone evidently applied the wrong spell to that particular potion. I'll let the Live team know. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Another <a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/reviews/game_review_678.html">new review of Kunark</a> can be found on the pages of the DailyRadar.  The rating Kunark receives from them is a "Hit" (one of the site's best ratings).  Here's an excerpt: <UL>Unfortunately, the expansion pack wasn't completely finished by the time it launched on March 24. Many of the sounds weren't put in -- it's rather strange to listen to your lizard character make human sounds while striking a scorpion. Of course, the scorpion itself doesn't have any sounds -- whenever players hit it, they hear their own cries in its stead. Other difficulties arise as a result of the game's beauty -- the higher polygon counts mean reduced performance on slower machines, so if you ran EverQuest slowly, you'll really move through molasses in Kunark. The higher polygon counts are only in the new lands added by the expansion pack, however, so the older areas of the game will still look -- and play -- the same.</UL>

A few posts were made recently on the Gameplay Board by Verant's Gordon Wrinn.  Here's the skinny:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039617.html"><b>Kerra Faction</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Befor the Kerra Isle remake when you killed them you got several positive faction bonuses. This allowed a Erudite SK i hade made gather enough faction to walk thry Erudin and make it do the boat. Well they no longer give faction positives!!! so my new Necro cant increase his faction. Please return the faction to where it was before. Thanks!]</i><P> The only positive faction that they gave before was something like "High Guards of Erudin". However, no NPCs were ever assigned this faction, so there wasn't a benefit from building it up. I'm not sure how your SK got to the point that he could walk through Erudin, but there are other means of raising faction with the townfolk.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039612.html"><b>Shacke of Dust & Corpse Decaying</b></a><br>These chain-quests are designed to reward those who protected the item from inception and through each step of the quest. I would recommend that people put the shackle in the bank until they get to the point that their corpse stays around a while. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039574.html"><b>Kunark Sound Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post:  Just a quick question: When are the sound issues on Kunark going to be addressed? I'm sure I'm nto the only one who's sick of hitting just about anything and having it grunt like a human...]</i><P> They've been addressed in code already, we just need to get them over the live servers. It's looking like the week after next for the next patch.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039480.html"><b>Gameplay Board Rules</b></a><br>That type of conversation has no place on these boards, and the moderators will delete them as we find them. We can certainly ban the station names that post this stuff, of course they'll just be able to create another until we get the code in to only allow EQ subscribers to post here.<br>--<br>I assume you speak of the post at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039436.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039436.html</a> <P>It's on page 5 at the time that I'm answering this post. This board uses an index system where the most reacently posted-to thread is moved to the top of the list. <P>We don't remove posts just because we don't like the contents. If we did that, I think that the majority of the posts on this board would disappear.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039455.html"><b>Lag Spikes</b></a><br>I'm sorry that I didn't get back to comment on this issue earlier. We've been looking around for things that could be causing what the players have been pointing out. We did find one issue that could cause something like that for a period of a few seconds, and that was being exacerbated by a network problem on a couple of servers (Quellious and Morrel-Thule) that has been fixed. But we haven't been able to find anything that could cause the 5-20 minute periods of this that some people are claiming. <P>I'm willing to keep looking into the issue.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039429.html"><b>Gordon's Customer Relations Skills</b></a><br>I normally don't like to get involved in this type of thread, but in this case I think I should since the way I phrased the comment can so easily be taken as a flame. <P>In the past I have from time to time said some things that were a bit harsh, but I've *never* outright flamed anyone, and that wasn't my intention here either. My intention was to try and explain the situation to the person I was replying to to their satisfaction, which wasn't done in the first post of his that I answered in the Kunark Faction thread. The purpose of my final comment was to identify a reason that I might not be explaining the situation clearly enough, and let him know that I was open and willing further address his issues until he was satisfied. <P>That said, in retrospect, I should have come up with a different way of stating my intention to help that couldn't be so easily misconstrued as a flame. As I mentioned above, I've never flamed anyone, nor would I, particularly someone with valid concerns. <P>I apologize to anyone that was offended.</UL>

The posting machine known as Gordon Wrinn made a few more posts in the last hour.  Here's the info ripped straight from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039201.html"><b>More on Solusek Ro Faction</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Although the blurb seems promising, the deity related items are presently few and far between. Further, there is a nasty SR faction problem in Kunark. This may be addressed (it should be next patch) but you are likely best off playing the middle and remaining Agnostic]</i><P> The original author mentioned that he was playing a high elf. Just to be clear, the Solusek Ro faction issue at the evil outpost would affect a high elf. He'll be fairly well hated there regardless what deity he chooses. But yes, we will be changing the faction offset for the Dark Elven worshippers of Solusek Ro and Bristlebane in the next patch.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039034.html"><b>Compelling Reasons</b></a><br>The "compelling reasons" why someone might choose to play one class, and another person a different one differ from person to person. I'll take a stab at how we look at it. Here's an example of two melee classes: <P>If a monk had the hitpoints of a warrior, could equip all of their armor, and didn't have the weight restriction, what would be the point of playing a warrior? The monk has a bunch of nifty skills and can do more damage with their bare hands than the warrior can. There's be no compelling reason to play a warrior if the monk could do everything better. <P>Now monks and warriors primarily compare damage dealing potential, but you also have to factor in other skills. The monk for instance can feign death. This also contributes to balance, even though it has nothing to do with offensive power. <P>Every class has something that they can do better than some other class. That does not necessarily mean that they are the *best* at that particular thing, just that they can do *something* better, and also do something worse. As an example, a cleric can heal better than any other priest class, yet their offensive spells are not as good as the other priest classes. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039244.html"><b>Invoke Fear Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: While feared, pet kills her. I receive no XP.  There seems to be a problem that when feared, you will not obtain the XP for the kill.]</i><P> This is true, and it's not really a bug per se. When feared you are basically an NPC. When your pet kills her the system looks for where to assign the XP and doesn't find a valid PC. This isn't something that can be changed without making major changes to the core architecture. </UL>

Gordon Wrinn made a big post concerning various faction issues in Kunark on the Gameplay Board a few minutes ago.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039204.html">the post</a>:<UL><i>With the number of posts about dungeon factions in Kunark, I wanted to take an opportunity to address them all at once:<br>Yes, it is correct, fighting in several dungeons in Kunark will lower your faction with VenrilSathir, and thus make conducting business in the outpost in the Overthere a bit rough. This is intentional, and is not a bug. It's also necessary for the political environment of Kunark to make sense, and our stance on it is firm. There are consequences, the importance of which each person has to decide for themselves, for killing everything that moves.<br><br>We're not forcing anyone to fight anywhere, or to stay out of any particular zone. Like all faction issues, it is your choice whether or not that faction is important to you. This is the same choice that players of good alignments had to make when deciding whether or not to kill things that give them bad faction. It's a personal choice. Being KOS in the evil outpost does not put the spells that are available there out of your reach. You certainly have the ability to have someone else, who is not KOS there, complete the quests for you. Evil races are KOS throughout Faydwer as it is, and people get along fairly well there. Kunark is not meant to be an encapsulated environment that people never leave. We expect people to have to go back to the mainland from time to time to get supplies and such. If you make yourself KOS to the outpost, there are other ways for you to get into Kunark without going through it. <br><br>So just to summarize, the factions are intentional. I suggest that everyone consider their options carefully before making a decision on how to tackle the continent.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>
