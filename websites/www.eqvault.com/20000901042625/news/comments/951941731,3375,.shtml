<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid made three posts recently on the Gameplay forum about the burnout phenomenon and other issues related to the life span of a game like EQ.  Here's the posts:<UL><I>Let's look at some facts: <P>EverQuest currently is not being advertised, either on the web or in print. <P>Other than the occasional in-store promotion, EQ pretty much just sits on the basic shelves at the various stores along with all the other older software. <P>EQ was the second best selling game at Electronics Botique in 1999, beaten only by Tiberian Sun. <P>EQ continues to sell between 500 and 800 units EVERY DAY. This has been true for some time. <P>So 40 (MAYBE in that one doesn't yet have to use one's EQ account name to post) of 189,932 EQ players post that they wouldn't reccomend EQ to their friends, yet they still go out of their way to frequent EQ's message board and make posts. <P>Meanwhile EQ sells 500-800 units every day with no advertising and minimal promotions. <P>Hrm, just where now are these 500 people every day hearing about EQ and why are they deciding to buy it? <P>Could it be... their friends? <P>Yes, I see a pattern. <P>-Brad</i></UL>Here's the second:<UL><b>How good is that word of mouth going to be in a few more weeks, or months, as more and more people hear from these 40?</b><P>Oshlarian, people have been complaining about EQ and how it's doomed and how as soon as another MMORPG comes out everyone will leave and how they're going to tell everyone that EQ sucks, etc. for MONTHS. <P>40 of you? There are probably hundreds of people who feel the way you do. EQ isn't for everyone. Some people don't like EQ right away, some people don't like it after they play 8 hours a day for months, earn a 50th level character, and then email me about how Verant sucks and the game design behind EQ is horrible, and then there's the vast majority of players who just keep on playing and having fun. <P>It's pretty normal. When you have 189,000 players you're going to have all types. Even the type that seems to hang around this message board the most... the players who just like to complain, yet keep on playing. It's not unique to EQ by any means, though. They are there on UO boards, they were around when I used to MUD a lot (heck, I was part of that crowd for a while on the MUD I played big time on). <P><b>Now I understand that this is your game, but a game in not really any good without players, and your company's policies and attitudes are alienating those very players.</b><P>Like I said, I'm sure we are alienating some players with our decisions. It's inevitable. You can't please everyone all the time. But one of our biggest problems right now is overcrowding, which is the result of waaaay more people playing EQ than we ever thought would play, especially almost a year after its launch. Were our policies and decisions negatively affecting even a small but significant portion of our player base, overcrowding would not be an issue. <P><b>The arbitrary and high handed actions of some of the people working at Verant has caused quite a backlash of anger among many of us here, because there seems to be little concern for the customer after purchase. <P>It "Seems" that once you get your 50 bucks for the game, you consider the $10 a month gravy, and could care less if you get it or not. <P>Now this may not be your attitude, but it dose seem to be the attitude of some of the people working for you.</b><P>I assure you it is neither my attitude nor the people working for me. With all due respect, the notion that we only care about the revenue from the initial box sale and not about the monthly subscription costs is ludicrous at best. If we cannot keep people subscribing to EverQuest the game will go away. Personally, I want to keep making these games (MMORPGs) for quite a long time so it's certainly deeply in my interest that EQ is and remains profitable. And, like I mentioned earlier, if we have a problem at all, it's that too many people are buying the game and staying subscribed to it (the overcrowding issue) :)<P><b>We have asked simple questions and been told.. in effect "You don't Need to Know.." <P>This is not acceptable behavior for a customer support group. at least give us something to go on here. Please?</b><P>I must disagree. There are many questions that we should not answer, just like when playing AD&D there are many questions and details the DM will not reveal. <P><b>1 What Basic (no formulas required) effects do stats have on melee combat?</b><P>I believe this has been answered to an extent by Abashi in the past. We are not going to reveal anything more than he already has because we don't want to spoil the game. I encourage you to experiment yourself with different item configurations and to draw your own conclusions. You see, experimenting with different item configurations is PART of EQ's gameplay as per design. If we reveal the details it ruins an aspect of gameplay, just as spoiler sites that post the solutions to quests also ruin aspects of EQ's gameplay. <P><b>2 Why can Mob's attack through solid walls, and we can't?</b><P>I have answered this in the past, and am more than happy to do so again :)<P>When designing and implementing the engine behind EQ we had to make many sacrifices. Computer game creation is often confronted with these choices, because one is always limited by the performance available in terms of hardware and software. <P>So here's your answer: In order to create large outdoor zones in a 3D world and have our servers run at an acceptable level of performance we had to turn off server side collision detection for many outdoor objects. <P><b>Oshlarian asked:3 What are you going to do about the over crowding/camping issues?</b><P>Well, according to you and the other 40 people this shouldn't be a problem, no? People should be leaving this horrible game in droves :)<P>But seriously, here's what we have planned: <P>More servers (the next server will be the Fennin Ro split -- yes, it's late -- we are still working on the scripts and infrastructure necessary to make this transition). <P>We will be launching the Expansion April 24th, which will increase the size of Norrath by about 33%. <P>We are working on revamping existing dungeons such that the spread of players is more evenly distributed amongst the zones we do have. Basically, we need to get players into the several underpopulated dungeons (Najena, Permafrost, Kerra Ridge, Mistmoore, etc). <P><b>And please don't take that as a threat, it is meant as a bit of advice from someone that really loves this game.</b><P>I appreciate that and understand it as well. In fact, that's why I'm here addressing these issues and trying to answer your questions :)<P>I know that most of the people who complain here really do love EQ, or at least loved it for quite some time. As I mentioned earlier, I used to complain a lot in a MUD I used to play. I put about 60 days of playing time into my level 50 Ranger there. After a while I'd question any little change the people who ran that game made, especially if it affected me or my friends in any way. And though I'd play the game for hours every night, I'd spend some of that time complaining and whining. <P>I think perhaps this is inevitable in this genre, or at least while this genre is fairly new. People aren't used to playing a game for MONTHS, investing huge amounts of time into it. Most single player games you buy, take home, and either you discover you don't care for it right away and shelf it/return it, or you enjoy it and play it quite a bit for a few weeks until you complete it. With a MMORPG you end up investing an order of magnitude more time into it. Couple that with the fact that these games change and evolve and can be patched and that you have the opportunity to be heard by the creators of that game, and you end up with a small, vocal group who is constantly complaining and trying to bring attention to themselves. <P>I understand completely the personal investment our playerbase has made and the passion and attachment they have. I also understand completely that 'familiarity breeds contempt' and that the more you play a game like this, the more the little, minor problems that you ignored at first begin to bother you more and more. I also understand that nobody wants their character's class nerfed, or the item they worked for hours to obtain changed negatively, even if the change is for the overall good and balance of the game. <P>But I really submit that some of this phenomenon is inescapable due to the nature of this genre. I'm just hoping that a lot of it is because most people aren't used to the genre. Of the 189,000 people who play EQ, how many have played a game like this before? Maybe half of them played UO? Maybe. And before that? Probably very few (overall, MUDs have never been very popular, probably due to their text based nature). MMORPGs are sooo different than single player games (and so much better, IMHO :)I think they'll take a bit to get used to. <P>That, and future MMORPGs will be that much better too! Remember, EQ is part of the first generation of these games. In my opinion, we've only just scratched the surface here. EQ, UO, and AC are only the tip of the iceberg. Personally, I'm very excited to be part of this new and emerging industry, because we've only just begun. <P><b>(I didn't realize that until someone here pointed out to me, that we complain the most about things we care about. Many here have since denied it, but I think "They doth protest too much" to paraphrase "THE BARD")</b><P><P>Agreed. <P>Thanks very much for your comments. <P>-Brad</UL>And now the third post:<UL><i>Preface: I had to think about whether to respond again to this thread, because trying to communicate one of the points I'm trying to make (I touched on it in my second post on this thread) may be futile. I say this because when I was burned out after playing a MUD I used to play a lot (over 2 years, 50+ days invested) I don't know if I would have acknowledged the problem, at least not initially (I did figure it out over time, after thinking about the phenomenon a lot, and wondering and planning how EQ would deal with it). <P>But, what the heck, I'll go for it. You guys can agree or disagree, but this is my analysis of the MMORPG burnout phenomenon: <P>First, a few assertions: <P>1. Game lifespan. Games like EQ, UO, the better MUDs out there, etc. generally hold people's attention MUCH longer than conventional games. I'm talking about the players who enjoy the game initially, of course, not the ones who decide they don't like it in the first week or so and then return it/shelf it. Generally, the longer a person is associated with something and the more time invested, the more attached he or she gets. So it's pretty safe to say that players who really get into MMORPGs become VERY attached to them, and the longer they play, the more attached. <P>2. Patching. MMORPGs can and are patched. They evolve and change. When you buy a conventional game you know that what you bought is pretty much what you have. There may be a few maintenance patches that fix bugs, and there may be an expansion in the game's future if the game is successful, but still, overall, the game is the game. Not so, of course, with MMORPGs. Features are added, content is added, game balance is adjusted (be it via enhancements or 'nerfs'), etc. The player KNOWS that the game COULD be, over time, made into something EXACTLY what he or she is looking for. At least in theory an MMORPG could evolve over time into the 'perfect' game, at least for one player (obviously not for everyone, because one player has different needs and wants than another player -- the old 'you can't please everyone all the time' adage applies here). <P>3. 'Familiarity breeds contempt'. People get burnt out of just about anything in life. Some things take longer to grow weary of, but eventually just about everything grows old. As another poster wrote, and I paraphrase, 'no game has infinite playability.' I'm sure different people have different expectations, some realistic and perhaps others not so realistic, as to how long a game like EQ 'should' hold their attention, but, regardless, nobody expects EQ or any other MMORPG to hold their interest forever. It's also pretty safe to say that a flaw in something or someone can remain hidden, overlooked, or flat out ignored if the overall package is generally a good one. For example, if I buy a new car and it has a few problems, but overall it's what I wanted, then I'll probably ignore the problem (at least initially). But, over time, as the newness of the car wears off, as I get accustomed to the 'good' the car offers me, the problem(s) tends to get more and more annoying, until eventually, sometimes, it's all that's on my mind. After a while, every time you hop in your car that damn lump in the seat becomes more and more uncomfortable. Well, perhaps that's not the best analogy of all time, but you get the picture. <P>4. Ease of communication with the dev team. Well, here we are. Gordon posts here, I read and sometimes post, and quite a few of the other dev team members are lurkers. You can complain and say we don't post enough, or that we don't listen to your needs, or that our customer service isn't robust enough, etc., but the fact is, here I am at 10:54 pm, at home, posting to a public message board frequented by EQ players, attempting to communicate and address an issue. Criticize, flame, yell and scream, but we're here, trying. This isn't always possible with games (or many other consumer products, for that matter) and while it isn't necessarily unique to MMORPGs, I think it's fair to say that this genre as a whole makes more of an overall effort to set up communication channels with its player base (it really makes sense, because being an online only genre we can assume that our player base would tend to by internet savvy, familiar with message boards, usenet, etc.). (Disclaimer: I know there are other developers out there making non-MMORPGs who post, do chats, write .plan files, etc., so please don't take offense at this assertion - none is meant - I'm definitely generalizing). <P>Conclusion: Many players will, after a significant period of time, become 'burnt out', disenchanted, etc. with an MMORPG. Although the player started playing the MMORPG and really liked it, over time those little nagging problems became significant issues for him. He communicated his wishes and comments to the dev team and they didn't respond and/or implement his suggestions, even though they could have. This is upsetting to the player. He really cares deeply about the game, he KNOWS the problems he has could be addressed via patching, and he KNOWS the dev team is listening. So the game he wholeheartedly supported, loved, and recommended early on slowly evolves into more of a love/hate relationship. He's still addicted, he's invested a LOT of time into his character and the items his character possesses, but at the same time he's becoming more and more frustrated with the developers and maintainers of this game, because, after all, they COULD address his issues. And, of course, every time he experiences one of the problems he has with the game, whether it's a bug or something intentional he deems a design flaw, it bothers him more and more. He probably didn't notice the problem at first, or if he did, he ignored it in that it was dwarfed by the overall newness of the game. But now&#8230; now it's really on his nerves. <P>I submit this phenomenon I've described rarely if EVER happens with conventional, single player games because at least three if not four of the assertions I made above are not applicable to most games. This phenomenon is therefore relatively new (although it's common with MUDs and has been happening for years, MUDs have never been mainstream and I'd say probably 95% of EQ players, for example, have never played a MUD, much less been addicted to one). It's new, but it's not going away. As I mentioned in my previous post, this genre is still in its infancy. EQ, UO, AC, etc., I still consider FIRST generation MMORPGs. And while they're all great games I think it's safe to say that the second and third generation MMORPGs will blow away the earlier ones. We will learn from our mistakes, we will have better technology, we will have more support and bigger budgets, etc. And because of all this, I think we can somewhat reduce this burnout phenomenon, or at least make it such that it takes LONGER for the average player to become burnt out or disenchanted. <P>See, I get it. I've been there. I've experienced it. At one point I'd play maybe three or four hours a night, have a blast 90+% of the time, but spend the other percentage *****ing with my guildmates as to how poor decisions were being made by the MUD's admins, how we were running out of high level content and needed more zones, how one class wasn't balanced relative to the others, etc. I LOVED the game, but after a while I didn't care much for the admins. When they changed something I didn't agree with it affected me PERSONALLY because I had a huge personal attachment both to the game and to my character (level 50 ranger, 50+ days played, tons of very hard to get, rare items, etc). How DARE they make a change that affected ME adversely, regardless of the fact that it was to maintain their overall vision of the game, or their long term plans, or to preserve a semblance of overall game balance. <P>Ok, so if this is an inescapable phenomenon, if it's only a matter of time before many or most players experience it, then what can we do? What can the players do? What can the developers do? Well, that's why I wrote the preface to this post: I'm not sure if an explanation will help. I'm not sure how many players can step away and analyze the situation and at least understand it. Like I said, at the time this was happening to me I don't think I could have. It took time, it took looking at it from a third person perspective (which I was trying to do because we were designing EQ at the time and I wanted to avoid the mistakes of the past), and most of all, it took experience in the genre (i.e. playing these kinds of games for a long time, looking at other MUDs, reading what others were saying about other MUDs, etc.) So my hope is that as the genre matures so also will the player base (I really don't mean that in a condescending way, so please don't take it as such). I hope that players will recognize what is happening and remember it when communicating to the developers. I hope the developers will recognize it and double their efforts to communicate to their players and to address players' needs and issues. I hope that some players will know when to quit (or at least take a break), preferably BEFORE they get so upset that they flame, insult personally, and swear never to buy a game from developer X ever again. I also hope that the players will still recommend the game they had so much fun with to others, but at the same time warning their newbie associates about this phenomenon, about the intense personal attachment and passion that often accompanies these games, and the signs of burn out and disenchantment of which to be wary. Lastly, I hope that players will over time realize that while the game can indeed be patched and changed, that the developers must consider the overall health of the game and make changes accordingly. <P>As I finish this up, let me leave generalizations and references to the genre as a whole and switch to EverQuest specifically. In other words, how does all of this relate to EQ today? Well, I think EQ has a very bright future ahead of it. I think there is a lot we have yet to accomplish, a huge world we can expand, tons of new features, quests, items, and NPCs we can add, and more. I look at UO and I see a game with 150,000 subscribers over two years after it's release. Regardless of how I feel about that game's design, issues, and problems, that is VERY respectable. EQ has been out almost a year now and it's still growing like crazy. It is by far the most successful online only game of all time (we are closing in rapidly on the 200,000 subscriber mark). A huge Expansion to the game is about to be released, increasing the size of the world by over 30%, upping the quality of the graphics and other details, and adding a new playable race. The vast majority of players who've ever played EverQuest are STILL playing! (Contrary to another post and some incorrect data, significantly less than 30% total have quit over the 11 months EQ has been out). And again, one of the origins of our problems (overcrowding) is because, despite no formal marketing in MONTHS, the game continues to sell (primarily because of word of mouth). All in all, people LOVE EQ, they can't stop playing it, and they tell their friends to buy it. <P>But yes, there are problems. The game is hardly perfect. There are game mechanics that could and will be improved over time. There are overcrowding issues that will, over time, be addressed. There are the changes we'll have to make in the future to maintain balance and the overall health of the game that will upset some players, affecting them directly and adversely. And there are people both leaving the game as well as those who haven't left but who are becoming burnt out and disenchanted, either with the game or with us, or both. And many of this latter category post on this message board. <P>So what are we going to do about it? Well, let me assure you that while I think this phenomenon is in many ways inevitable and unavoidable, we're still going to do everything in our power to minimize it. As I mentioned in my earlier post it is absolutely in our interest that as many players keep subscribing as possible. You can interpret that as base greed, self-preservation, the desire to be able to keep making games like this and fulfill our dreams, or all three (which is probably closest to the truth), but it's true nonetheless. We want to make as many of you happy as often as possible and for as long as possible. <P>So here's the plan: we will continue to listen, we will continue to post, we will continue to try to explain our positions and to gather great ideas from our player base. We will launch servers as fast as we are able in order to keep overcrowding down (and no, regardless of how hard we try, that probably won't be fast enough for many of you). We will launch our first Expansion in late April, increasing the size of the world and hopefully breathing a breath of fresh air into the world of Norrath. We will continue to adjust, maintain, balance, and add features to the client and server. We will continue to add new quests, items and NPCs. We will re-tune and revamp existing areas and zones in an attempt to spread people out and entice them to enjoy ALL of Norrath's adventure areas. And, longer term than that, we have some other pretty nifty EQ related projects in the works, whether they be expansion, sequels, or what have ya. Verant is definitely in this for the long term. I hope you all hang with us and keep the faith. I hope that you keep playing EQ and enjoy the upcoming Expansion. But if you need to take a break, please do. And if you want to try our competition, please do. By all means play the game you have the most fun with - as I posted some weeks ago, life is too short to play a game you're not really enjoying. No game is right for everyone, and no matter how hard we try there will always be people who disagree with the direction we are taking the game or the decisions we are making. With 195,000+ players I'm sure statistically there are hundreds, if not thousands, who are burnt out and disenchanted. And that number will probably grow over time. And I think that's at least somewhat inescapable, even though we're going to try our damndest to make that statistic as low as possible. <P>Ah well, that's pretty much it - we're doing our best, and we'll get better. If you still enjoy EQ, stick around, 'cause you ain't seen nothin' yet. But if you're starting to get that sour taste in your mouth, letting the game affect you personally, or getting steaming mad at us, well then, step back, think about what I've said please, see if it's applicable to you, and make your decision. Maybe understanding why you're feeling what you are will help, maybe not. Heck, maybe you think I'm just full of it :)In any case, keep the feedback and the constructive criticism coming, 'cause we're both listening and not going away :)<P>'nuff said. <P>-Brad</i></UL>Thanks Gordon! :)
