From Jonathan Grey:<BLOCKQUOTE>EVERYTHING HERE IS SIMPLY MY IMPRESSION from what I<br>was told by Verant employees. I do not guarantee the<br>authenticity of either the information I received, nor<br>do I take responsibility for my own, potentially<br>erroneous interpretation of any aspect of Luclin that<br>they discussed with me. I was told that Luclin is<br>still very far from release and many details have not<br>been finalized. I would not be at all surprised if<br>many of the features/details I mention below change <br>before Luclin is released.<br><br>Onto the info:<br><br>* The Beastlord class will be heavily pet dependent and<br>  will probably, at the highest levels, create a pet<br>  that is at least 10 levels lower than your character.<br>  On the other hand, the Beastlord will have a variety<br>  of buffs that will work only on his own pet (though<br>  he will have other buffs that can be used on other<br>  characters/pets) which could effectively increase<br>  the capability of the pet by a factor of 10 levels or<br>  more.<br><br>  When I mentioned that this would cause problems with<br>  aggro (i.e. low level pets causing everything green<br>  to jump it) I was told that aggro is being redesigned<br>  to take buffs and overall strengths of the pet into<br>  consideration.<br><br>* Beastlord pets quite possibly will not be able to<br>  persist through zoning due to the unusually large<br>  difficulty of getting npcs to zone.<br><br>* Expect some aspects of Beastlords to be very similar<br>  to existing hybrids, except with Shaman spells.<br>  (At the same time I heard someone say that they'll<br>  be totally different from hybrids with a lot of<br>  unique spells, and more of a pet class, so I'm not<br>  sure they're too solid on this.)<br><br>* Beastlord pets will be unique and will not be the<br>  same as Shaman pets, or any other pets currently<br>  in the game. The pet selection will vary depending<br>  on the race of the Beastlord.<br><br>* The Bazaar zone will be in a central city located<br>  on Luclin that is neutral to all races. The city<br>  itself will be bordered by four different dungeons.<br><br>  The Bazaar will feature a variety of named and<br>  differently colored tents to make it easy to tell<br>  players where you will be meeting them, and will<br>  feature a bank. Additionally, the city will be, or<br>  be right next to, the primary entry point for <br>  Luclin, to make getting there convenient.<br><br>* Similar to Velious, there probably won't be any<br>  factions that are correlated with factions in<br>  the rest of Norrath, with the possible exception<br>  of Kerran/Var Shir (since they are related.)<br>  This is because Luclin has been cut off from<br>  the rest of Norrath for quite some time.<br><br>* You will be able to play from level 1 to level<br>  60 without ever leaving Luclin.<br><br>* It is quite probable that existing characters<br>  will be given a one-time-only option to pick<br>  a new face when Luclin is released.<br><br>* On a somewhat related note, Var Shir (Kerran)<br>  models will not only feature different faces,<br>  but entirely different matching skin patterns. In<br>  addition to the tiger Var Shir pictured in<br>  the E3 screenshots, there may be black panther<br>  Var Shir, lions, leopards, etc.<br><br>* I asked about the alternative character<br>  development and was told that there would be<br>  new skills available for characters who are<br>  level 60. To get and increase these skills,<br>  you will need to spend experience you get<br>  that is over the experience you needed for<br>  level 60. (Currently any experience you get<br>  over level 60 isn't really important, aside<br>  from the death penalty.) You may also be<br>  able to spend your post-60 experience on<br>  perks like purchasing a title ("Bob the<br>  vindicator", etc.)<br><br>* Armor now can have its own geometry. If<br>  you take a look at the screenshots from E3,<br>  you'll notice that human armor plates go<br>  beyond the shoulders of the player model.<br>  Expect to see armors that significantly<br>  alter the appearance of a character due<br>  to the ability to create different shaped<br>  armor.<br><br>* The trees in Luclin very possibly will not be<br>  animated, as people have pointed out from the<br>  screenshot. An artist I spoke to said that this<br>  is due to the mostly negative reaction to having<br>  tree animations in the previous expansions.<br><br>Jonathan Grey<br>Paladin of Letalis Ericius <br>E'Ci</BLOCKQUOTE>The report is much appreciated, thanks Jonathan!

This one is almost too weird to believe.  What does EverQuest have in common with Major League Baseball?  Find out in a recent article that <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/columns/stark_jayson/1201283.html">appeared on the pages of ESPN.com</a>:<UL>This, folks, is why Doug Glanville is one of our favorite Americans.<br><br>But it seemed to us that there clearly was more to this saga -- something deep and painful, something tragic and powerful. We went digging for the full story.<br><br>As Glanville remembers this poignant tale, he and Schilling were playing a computer game called "EverQuest" -- an online version of Dungeons and Dragons.<br><br>"One day," Glanville told Week in Review, "Schill was playing his character, Cylc" -- whom Glanville described as "a dwarven Cleric," whatever that is -- "and he asked me to team up with him in Faydwer, in the zone of the Butcherblock Mountains, to kill Aviaks, which are basically walking birds."<br><br>Hang with us here, friends. There will be a baseball point coming.</UL>Special thanks goes to Spuff, Mynegon and many others for sending in the link!

Shelby sent a few of her observations of the next expnasion made while at e3:<BLOCKQUOTE>A couple of things you might notice while your at e3, are that there are now<br>2 clipping planes.  The one we are all used to, and another that draws the<br>grasses, you can adjust both of them, or even turn off the grasses.  Another<br>note that the zone they were displaying the tree's werent moving.  Static,<br>unlike kunark.  Also be sure to check out the gremblin model, I havent seen<br>any screen shots of it yet, but it looks like a skinny version of the gnome.<br>Also be sure to check out the new emotes.

Spence sent this in:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings Citizens of Norrath!<br><br>The Combine Empire of Vallon Zek is holding a grand event to celebrate its revival and rise back to power. This 'Celebration of the Rebirth' will be taking place in the Northern reaches of the Desert of Ro (SUN MAY 20, 8:00 EST). <br> <br>Our healers will be setting up a medical station at the inn for young adventurers who wish to help patrol the desert (free heals and buffs to newcomers) and perhaps distributing some equipment to those wishing to pursue a life as a human purist crusader. <br><br>I urge all Humans as well as our pureblooded Erudite and Barbarian kin to attend this fair and join us in the celebration.

Check out the latest tidbits from Alan directly from the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000165.html"><b>Charm Change</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: perhaps the bard above did not phrase it properly. Yes, it removes charm kiting as a solo method for bards, but that is because it practically removes charm as an effective bard too (I have played a bard, and I will vouch for this). <br><br>This means that bards have real trouble charming while soloing OR in groups. Actually, its a little easier soloing because the bard can simply keep swapping charmed targets. This is not viable in groups. <br><br>I understand the need to fix exploits, but please take a close look at this soon. Bard charm was a great part of crowd control when an enchanter was not available (hey, I can't be EVERYWHERE at once), and I would hate to see them lose this. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Leirra ]</i></font><br><br>Oh, don't misunderstand me. We certainly understand how this change affects group play to. My only point was that the fact that the change makes soloing harder isn't a very persuasive argument. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000164.html"><b>Imbue Caution</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I caution you to be careful if you're going to allow bards to imbue gems. If you are going to let one religion of bards do it, you must let them all do it. <br><br>I play a bard that worships Karana, which only confers role-playing benefits to me; there are no in-game mechanics benefits for a bard worshipping Karana. And as such, I would feel offended if bards of one religion could imbue their own gems, and I could not. Agnostic bards, who already have advantages over non-agnostic bards with faction, would not be hurt by this since the advantage gained by their faction is greater than that gained by imbuing gems. <br><br>--Daveon Silverstring<br>--50th level bard, Brell Serilis ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I'm not a subscriber to slippery slope arguments. Yes, we have to consider how people will feel if they don't get to do something others can do. But there's no 'must let them do it' involved here. <br><br>Look at it this way. The reason for letting Veeshan worshipping bards imbue gems is because no worshipper or Veeshan can imbue gems, so worshippers of Veeshan are left out. Therefore we 'must' let them do it? Maybe&#8230; <br><br>You bard can get imbued armor, a Veeshan bard can't. That's really the concern to be addressed. The fact that other bards can't imbue gems isn't going to be an issue of game play. It might be an issue about game universe consistency and player concern, but we won't need to add imbue ability to other bards for game balance or gameplay reasons. <br><br>No final decision has been made here about this, and we'll talk over the consequences. But to me having the armor available (so as not to be a restriction for Veeshan worshipping bards) is more important than making the imbue spell available to all bards (not so much a restriction on other bards, as a lack of an advantage&#8230;).<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just to respond to the comments on camping a fixed spawn being boring... <br><br>Boredom is an emotion, not a pre-existant state. If I want action or companionship in EQ but spend my time solo, killing the same 6 minute spawn over and over, then clearly I am going to be bored and frustrated. <br><br>If, on the other hand, I am listening to a good play on the radio or reading an exciting novel, then the control and predictability and minimal need for attention at a fixed spawn is ideal. <br><br>Add to that an existential appreciation for the easthetic of repetition (should be familiar to all devotes of Philip Glass or The Velvet Underground) and solo single spawn camping becomes less about boredom and more about art. <br><br>The thing is, lots of people enjoy moaning, me included. But if they didn't at some level have "fun" camping static spawns, they wouldn't do it. <br><br>Anyway, you see a lot less of it than did before Velious came out. It's going out of fashion, but I still enjoy a bit of retro-boredom chic once in a while.]</i></font> <br><br>:)<br><br>And, actually, you do make a very good point. If people do it, it must be what they want to do. <br><br>Chris_B wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Other things that would be good to build quests round are other skills besides Tradeskills. <br><br>For example, a quest could require you to 'Beg' a quest item off a NPC. To do this you would need to have a high Begging skill. Some quests already require a high Forage Skill (Druid/Ranger Epic for example.) <br><br>Or you may have to kill an NPC that can only be hit with 2HB weapons or a NPC that runs realy fast away from you and is totally Magic Imune so you have to use range weapons. <br><br>Some players take a lot of time to get other skills up besides tradeskills. It would be nice to have quests to reward them too. ]</i></font><br><br>Hehe, beggar quests&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000170.html"><b>Douglas Adam's Passing</b></a><br>We've discovered that almost everyone on the team is a fan of Douglas Adams. We've been zapping emails with quips and quotes around the office all week. I'm still in that stage where disbelief is stronger than acceptance. <br><br>Sleepycleric is correct. Even those that have never read his books have been influenced by his work in so many ways. Several of us here, including myself, attribute a large part of our sense of humor to him. <br><br>Thanks for all the responses and suggestions. I'll keep a list for the team.</UL>

From Lava:<BLOCKQUOTE>Sing Lung is an editor in "real life" and the editor-in-chief of our new online magazine <a href="http://www.fanstory.com/fanmag/">fanMAG</a>. In the interview she offers advice on how writers can improve their work. She also talks about her motivation for her book <a href="http://www.fanstory.com/displayStory.asp?id=286">Path of the Dragon</a> and her love of massive multiplayer gaming.<P>An Excerpt:--<P>---------------<P><b>FanStory.com:</b> How would you suggest a writer improve his writing?<br><br><b>SingLung:</b> Learn to read critically, and learn to take criticism. Read and review as many stories as you can. Pay close attention to how the author writes -- what pulls you in to the story, and what knocks you out of it. If you don't like a story, figure out why. When you get a critical review, give the reviewer's suggestions some serious thought (as long as they are constructive). Try them out. You might be surprised if you do -- or you might find a better solution. When a critique puts me on the defensive or makes me feel compelled to explain my story, that tells me I should pay attention to it. It doesn't mean the reviewer is necessarily right, it just means I might not be getting my point across as well as I thought. <P>------------<P><a href="http://www.fanstory.com/displayStory.asp?id=904">The Interview</a><P>Thanks,<br>Lava</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Get the skinny on what's been happening on the Developer's Corner by reading today's Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000142.html"><b>Guide Account Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've always wanted to be a guide, and it seems my attempts have always been thrwarted. I enjoy helping people, which is the main reason why my main isn't even to level 40 yet. But, here is what you said: <br><br>1) You must have an active, and in good standing, EverQuest account.<br>2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.<br>3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.<br>4) You will need good communication skills.<br>5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.<br>6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must. <br><br>I'm 17, which I guess is a tough break for me, other than the fact you're missing out on an excellent guid. =P But why? Legality reasons? People don't responsible until they are legally an adult? <br><br>And why the no-shared account? It doesn't apply to me, but my local EQ friend shares his account with his brother. His brother is pretty trustworthy from what I've seen, and doesn't want anything to do with guides. If you're worried about his brother logging on and doing un-guidely things, then you shouldn't. I thought the Guide Application asked for another password other then your EQ account's one, but it may have changed since I checked it last time. We were kinda hoping (however slim the chance) that we could be Guide-Mates, but now there isn't even a slight possibility of it happening... <br><br>Just curious about the above, and thanks for listening. Hope you'll need more guides for Luclin. I'll be 18 by then! <br><br>~RivenClaw ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, the age restriction is a legal issue. At 18 you are considered an adult, for the most part, and you are responsible for your own actions. We certainly have nothing against people under that age of 18, but we need to follow certain guidelines (I'm no lawyer, and I'm not going to let one post here, either :))<br> <br>And, well, sharing your account is against the EULA. Someone that is unwilling to follow the instructions in the EULA might not be the best candidate to be a guide. <br><br>And, well, letting anyone log on to your guide account is not acceptable. Sure, that person might be trustworthy. But there have been so many cases of trustworthy people giving out passwords that it's not even funny. And, well, if that person wants to become a guide, that's great. Run them through the approval process and let us be responsible for making them a guide. Letting someone use your guide account is very inappropriate. <br><br>Don't share your account, please. Far too many people are hurt by doing so.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000164.html"><b>Cleric Imbue Spell</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Maybe da truth is dat Veeshan just no wana give her power ta some stinky bard gem. <br><br>-Lary da Troll, Slayer a Stinky Bards]</i></font> <br><br>Well, Lary, I'm not going to comment on the stinkiness of Bards as it that might relate to Trolls of any particular class&#8230; <br><br>But I have been hearing rumors that we might have a way of getting a bard song to imbue gems. I'm mentioning this now, though I really shouldn't. We haven't actually tried to get it to work yet, and we most certainly won't try it until after E3 some time. But it might be something we can make work. I just don't want you all to get your hopes up. <br><br>I'm off to take a shower or something&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing For Experience</b></a><br>Lithandar_Lorathian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "For me, if doing something is fun, that's why <br>I'll do it. If questing is more fun than <br>camping, then why are people camping? <br><br>The only answer that I can think of is that some <br>people get more fun out of gaining levels and <br>items than they do out of playing the game. So <br>that they will trade two hours of fun for two <br>hours of something they are not enjoying and <br>some experience and loot. "<br><br>I think the main problem with your comment is this: <br><br>Yes, doing something I have fun at is much more rewarding than something I don't entirely enjoy, however, once I've done all the quests that are around my level and there aren't any more suited for me until i reach a significantly higher level it's right back to camping for levels until I can do the next quests. <br><br>I don't entirely belive quests should give out more xp than they do, maybe if they didn't give any items out that would be nice, then again, my highest level character is 27th, so I don't know what higher level quests yield. I simply think there should be many many more quests.. ]</i></font><br><br>There are probably gaps in places where there aren't enough quests. Creating more quests is a good thing on all accounts. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "For me, if doing something is fun, that's why I'll do it. If questing is more fun than camping, then why are people camping? <br><br>"The only answer that I can think of is that some people get more fun out of gaining levels and items than they do out of playing the game. So that they will trade two hours of fun for two hours of something they are not enjoying and some experience and loot." <br><br>Forget about the people that think camping is boring. If I understand you correctly; <br><br>If I am a person that has fun camping, I can reasonably expect to have fun AND get loot AND get nice exp. But if I *also* have fun doing the quests, then I must simply accept the fact that it may be fun, but provides no experience and not much loot. <br><br>Is this a correct interpretation? <br><br>Players, and casual players especially, will allot their time in-game to the activity that produces the best rewards within the limited time window. Measurements include number of items gained, amount of cash obtained, and even number of bubbles of experienced gained. Is it unreasonable to think quests might have numbers that at least come close to those for camping? <br><br>With the current state of things, players sit on their butts at a spawn site because that activity seems to produce the best results for the time spent on-line. Thus, questing is something few people participate in with any regularity. Given the name of the game on the box, this tends to produce some consternation in the players. <br><br>I must state for the record that this is an extremely fun game and all participants in it's development have done an astounding job. I am a software developer by trade, and I fully understand the difficulties in achieving such a task. That the people at Verant have produced such a fine product still amazes me. <br><br>That said, somebody needs to refocus on which in-game activities, questing or camping, produce the best rewards and do so from the *players* perspective. After all, is the name of this game Everquest, or Neverquest? <br><br>Lanceor d'Avignon<br>Paladin of Mith Marr<br>Xegony ]</i></font><br><br>Well, you are sort of correct. First of all, the assumption that quests don't give rewards of experience or loot isn't true. Sure, some quests don't give much loot or experience. And if you are turning in Gnoll fangs at 40th level, you're not going to feel well rewarded at all. <br><br>But a lot of quests do give out fair experience for their completion. Many quests are all about the item that you earn for doing them. So to characterize questing as something unrewarding isn't very fair. <br><br>Also, consider a simple quest, turning in Gnoll fangs in Qeynos. <br><br>If you are of the level where taking on the Gnolls of Blackburrow is a challenge, then completing that quest is, basically, free additional experience to be gained when you head to town to bank. So for quests like that any experience is pretty much enough, considering that turning in the fangs literally takes two or three minutes. <br><br>However, I will easily concede that there are quests that do not give out a large reward for the work that needs to be done to complete them. <br><br>But there is a catch to giving rewards for quests. For example, the recently hyped shark meat quest (or the Tumpy Tonic quest, if you want to go back a ways). The shark meat quest was put in with the intent that people would have to go kill sharks to get meat, or at least travel a long way to buy them from other PCs. Then we added vendors for shark meat as part of our ongoing changes to trade skills. We, basically, made the quest an experience and cash making machine. <br><br>Any quest that requires killing something gives experience for killing that thing (though you could have gotten that experience without the quest), so adding more experience or loot is a bonus. And quests that don't require killing things can easily be broken and abused. <br><br>I could go off on a tangent and argue that a casual player trying to maximize the value of his play time for reward/minute isn't actually playing an a casual way, but that's not where we want to go. :)<br><br>Regardless, the point you are making is certainly valid. And these are issues that we are looking into (well, right now we're looking into three days of trade show&#8230;). <br><br>Babbster wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just one tiny point of light here, and that's that "camping" doesn't always have to be boring, annoying, etc. What's wrong with six friends hanging out, killing some monsters, drinking virtual liquor, doing virtual dances, etc.? If people aren't having fun while camping, then it's not just a question of why they're doing it, but HOW they're doing it. After all, a necromancer or druid sitting by him or herself for hours on end OF COURSE is going to be boring. Maybe they'll learn someday. But six people who already know and like one another can sit for hours on end in one place in Everquest and have loads of fun (even sometimes when they don't get the MoB/item they were hoping for). It's all about perspective, though I will admit that I am a fan of the dungeon crawl myself. :)]</i></font><br><br>Good point. Yes, hanging out with people can be fun, and if you do that while camping, then camping can be fun. I've spent a few hours camping the gates of Qeynos playing hide and seek&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I would like to clear up why people camp XP and loot rather than just go and do what they consider fun. The reason people do this is because nothing is fun forever. <br><br>At level 20, there are places you can go and things you can do, but they will not stay fun for you forever, especially when there are new experiences waiting at higher levels. Want to go explore Kedge Keep? Want to go visit the dark, foreboding basement of Unrest? Do you want to go purge Mistmoore of evil? Well, if you want to do those things, you are going to need a few things. One of those is a higher level, and another thing is better equipment. It goes without saying that you will need skills and contacts as well. <br><br>I could go out and do what is fun at my level, but I've done that. If I want to see new areas, I need levels and loot. So my entire spiel breaks down into 2 parts. 1. Nothing stays fun forever, you can only do things at your level so many times before it gets less fun than finding new areas. 2. If you want to go to new areas, you need levels and loot. I submit to you that that is the reason why people camp experience and loot. <br><br>Whim Dreamstalker<br>44 enchie<br>Emarr ]</i></font><br><br>True. Nothing is fun forever. And gaining levels allows you to change the things you are doing. <br><br>But having fun does not mean never gaining experience. You can goof around and gain experience. You do not have to sit and stare at an empty orc camp. Sure, there are times when you want to concentrate on gaining experience, no matter how prone to goofing around you are. But even then, camping spawns isn't your only choice. <br><br>I'm not trying to tell you that we can't make some inroads on improving the volume, reward, and general fun level of quests. But I'm also not willing to accept that a quest isn't fun unless it gives a good reward, or that a quest sucks unless it gives good loot and experience. Fun is NOT exclusively judged by how much loot you get. That's what I'm trying to say. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just a note. <br><br>Many of us have developed many friends in eq... hence the wonderful success of eq.<br>however, to remain questing with your friends, you all need to stay near the same level. <br><br>Because some of your regular group is leveling, this limits your ability to quest, so you must camp also, in order to keep up. <br><br>After awhile, I think everyone gets wrapped up in the leveling aspect of the game, for example: <br><br>Certain classes gain significant power at certain levels, as you approach that plataue, you are motivated to HURRY up and gain this. This causes that reactionary effect with the rest of your group to keep up. Once you reach that level, soon, another in your group gets close, and he spends time trying to get exp quick, so he can gain his new abilities. Thus, once again, the rest of the group is forced to keep up. Soon in order to remain grouping with your friends, your all just camping for experience, and not truly getting the full enjoyment of the eq experience. <br><br>If we had quests that gave us experience, real worthwhile experience, I think you'd see a change for the better. <br><br>This is my theory anyway, at least from my observances. <br><br>Crohmm Stormfury<br>55th Warrior of Rodcet Nife<br>The "Blade" of VENGEANCE ]</i></font><br><br>I agree. I'm certainly affected by a desire to reach the next spell circle or combat skill. But I tend to avoid doing things that I don't find fun in order to get that reward. <br><br>As for staying within the level range of your group, that's sometimes hard. The trick that I use is that I play with more than one group. :)  Scheduling a few days as play days for each group works out well. People tend to stay within level ranges if we try to play only on the given nights together. If you miss one night, that's not going to cause a problem. <br><br>But that's how I approach it, as a casual gamer. It's different for everyone.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000171.html"><b>Zone Experience Bonuses</b></a><br>Valan wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello, <br><br>Can you please direct me to the location of zone / dungeon experience bonuses list on the EQ website. If there isn't one, could you please give me a listing or possibly have a listing placed in the EQ_manual in everyone's eq directory. I'm sure other players would benefit from this information as well. <br><br>I realize that underutilized zones and dungeons recieve an experience bonus to entice players to go to zones / dungeons with poor loot, poor access for melee binding, poor pathing, etc. I'd like to hunt for experience and so would benefit from knowing which underutilized zones / dungeons give the most experience. <br><br>Thanks in advance. ]</i></font><br><br>Sure. Actually, the best place to find the recent increases are on the web site. Head to EverQuest.com and look under the Producer's Letter. There's an archive at the top. Choose the Producer's Letter from January 14th, 2001. <br><br>I'll copy the relevant part here. After all, we want people using these zones, it won't hurt to remind everyone that we've recently increased the experience gain for them. <br><P><UL><br>quote: <br><br>In this case, we decided that the most appropriate action for several underutilized dungeons would be to increase the ZEM; that is, increase the amount of experience that everyone gets when adventuring in the zone. <br>As of the next patch, you will receive additional experience (per kill) in the following zones:<br>&#61623; Droga increased by 12% <br>&#61623; Nurga increased by 12% <br>&#61623; Solusek's Eye (SolA) increased by 13% <br>&#61623; Najena increased by 13% <br>&#61623; Befallen increased by 13% <br>&#61623; Paw increased by 13% <br>&#61623; Permafrost increased by 13% <br>&#61623; Kaesora increased by 18% <br>&#61623; Qeynos Catacombs increased by 20% <br>&#61623; Runnyeye increased by 20% <br>&#61623; Kerra Ridge increased by 20% <br>&#61623; The Hole increased by 25% <br></UL><P><br>Hope that helps. <br><br>]</i></font>I'd like to comment on the changes made to the experience system on January 17th. I think that overall the changes were very good. The method used to "remove" the experience penalty for those classes that had them (and were sharing them with their groups) works well... mostly. <br><br>The reason for having the experience sharing in groups the way that it had been since launch, as I understand it, was so that friends grouping together could stay together regardless of the classes they were playing. Well I must say, that system worked wonderfully. I play in a group with 5 RL friends. We started our characters together and do not play for experience unless we are playing together. Some of us do some trading or trade skills outside of the group. We play once a week for about 2.5 hours a session. We have been doing so for more than 20 months. We've stayed together easily through that time, advancing at the same pace, until recently. We have a warrior in our group who has started to outpace the rest of us. Due to the frequency of our playing (and several missed sessions) it has taken a few months to really see the difference. Since the experience bonus for warriors and rogues was not accounted for at the same time the experience penalty was for hybrids and intellegence based casters, groups of friends that play together can no longer stay together. <br><br>The idea of having a system that allows a group of friends like us to do what we are doing was a great one that apparently became pretty obvious during the beta testing. The changes to the experience system breaks that for any groups that have warriors or rogues in them, especially once the warrior's or rogue's level exceeds the rest of the group. They then start taking a larger percentage of the experience before class modifiers are applied. <br><br>Is there anything that can be done about this? Do you have suggestions for dealing with it? <br><br>Gruthil Roberts<br>22 Enchanter<br>Quellious ]</i></font><br><br>I figured I may as well tackle these issues together, since they are both relatively old issues about experience. <br><br>Actually, we looked at this very carefully. No matter what class or race combination you choose, if you play together at all times, characters will never gain a gap wide enough that they can't gain experience together. In fact, I think I remember that the widest possible gap was about two levels by the time they reach 60th level. But that was a while back, and it might have been three levels. But even at the extreme characters that play together will always be within experience range for grouping. And with the way experience is divided now, there is a slight advantage to the lower level group members that helps to prevent separation. <br><br>I'm not sure what is happening with your warrior.</UL>

Here are the latest information given by Alan from off of the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000134.html"><b>Flowing Thoughts</b></a><br>Let me start here with an apology. Someone pointed out that I was ranting a bit with my last post, and I was. I shouldn't be doing that. I apologize. <br><br>Aarreran-CrimRen wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Even though I agree with you that Flowing Thought isn't a bad thing, I though I'd point out that you were dead wrong when you said... <br><br>"It only appears on items found in the Plane of Hate and are no drop. So you won't find anyone under 46th level with an item like this."<br> <br>This is 100% incorrect. An item was found with Flowing Thought I on a Giant in Great Divide who was apart of the ring quest. Not only was an item with Flowing Thought I found on him, but an item with Flowing Thought II was found as well.]</i></font> <br><br>Yup, it seems to be the case that there are a few of the super high powered Flowing Thought II items available as well&#8230; <br><br>Flowing Thought II is, well, a little better than Flowing Thought. It is still far less useful than Clarity (though it might rival Breeze&#8230;), and it still stacks with all of those spells, so it's still not much of an issue. I would agree that an item better than that might be worthy of some concern, even if it does stack with Clarity. <br><br>And, as one reader has pointed out, there are in fact a few Clarity items in the game. <br><br>There are perhaps three items in the game that have the ability to cast Clarity II on their wielder (and only on the wielder). When I say three, I mean three total, across all the servers. These are, in fact, artifacts given out at two of the gatherings. As far as I know, no more of these items will ever come into the game (though I suppose they might, it's not part of any current plan, that's for sure). <br><br>Were these items dropping off any NPC in the game, no matter how rare, I would be concerned. But having three of them on all the servers should have absolutely no effect on the desire for enchanters or bards. <br><br>This one is kinda long, so I'm going to respond within the post. My comments are not bolded. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Greetings Absor, <br><br>I was reading over the post you made regarding wizards and I had a couple comments. Forgive me but I dont know the codes for this board. <br><br>Absor said: "Wizards can't sustain their damage output in fights that last longer than those that existed before Velious. This is the issue you're heading at. And, sure, giving Wizards a larger mana pool or a form of massive mana regeneration would fix it. But it also makes them more efficient in all other forms of casting. " <br><br>Mostly true. The wizard community feels it doesn't do enough damage, which is our primary focus. You mention that giving us 'massive' mana regeneration would too greatly benefit our other casting abilities and you would have to compensate. <br><br>Raising mana cost of non-dmg spells seems reasonable given what a wizard is, dmg caster, but mana regeneration may not entirely be the solution. At least in my opinion it isn't because of other problems wizards experience: ie agro. I dont have a useable skill\spell to lower my agro so typical raid fights entail casting and waiting for melees to rebuild up agro for me to cast again. THIS is why mana regeneration isnt entirely the solution for wizards. It may help, but in raid scenarios wont solve our problems. <br><br>To put it simply, wizards have 2 problems:<br>1) Low dmg<br>2) High agro doing that dmg. ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, I don't agree that wizards have problem #1. Low damage needs to be qualified with a 'compared to', in other words 'Low damage when compared with what a rogue can do over the course of ten minutes of continuous fighting' or 'Low damage when compared to what any other class can do when dumping mana to finish something off'. I'd say yes to one and no to the other. The problem is that when you make comparisons like that it's all in the wording. <br><br>As for #2, well, no more aggro than anyone else that does the same damage in the same time frame. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Mana regen solves 1, but makes 2 worse. ]</i></font><br><br>If wizards could suddenly regenerate mana at ten times the rate they do now, they could control their aggro, and in fact aggro control would be the only limit on their damage potential. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Not true. Casters are just as AC and HP dependent as anyone else. It's just that their hit points come in the form of melee classes and pets, in much the same way that melee characters draw their hit points from healers and their speed from casters." <br><br>You should stress this more as it is the crux for grouping in EQ. Unfortunately, if any two of those become too strong the third isn't necessary. Velious fights last minutes and in that duration melee is the most effective damage source. In that context, healer-melee is the only dynamic that matters. Casters just are added to fill in the gaps if necessary. ]</i></font><br><br>Agreed. And this is the place where the imbalance exists. But people too easily forget that when you are comparing melee damage to caster damage, you have to keep in mind that there are two people doing that melee damage, the melee and the healer. Take away the healer and your melee isn't going to live long enough to outdamage the caster in question. <br><br>But it is this situation where the imbalance exists, and it is these situations that we are aiming to fix. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Heck, wizards have a great damage over time ratio and this isn't even something that we're looking at improving." ]</i></font> <br><br>This, to me, doesn't make much sense. You mentioned above it was something being considered as a result of Wizard Talk. So how can we have 'great damage over time ratio'? Maybe explaining your qualifications for this would make it clear because in nearly all raiding fights melees do more than me. <br><br>Perhaps we're thinking of different uses of the term 'damage over time'. A lot of the responses sent in were telling me that a melee character does a lot more damage over an hour than a wizard. That's probably true at the upper levels. But what about over the course of one minute? If an NPC is fleeing, who finishes it off? I was thinking of damage over time as it relates to most fights, not the rare long fight one can encounter in Velious, since I've covered that separately. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said RE dmg/mana: "Bane spells. Other than that, I don't know." <br><br>I am not sure if you know this Absor, maybe ask Poe about it for further detail, but banes have a very very select group of creatures it can hit. About 10 in game roughly I would guess can be hit by both banes. Being effective on about 10 mobs doesn't make us more attractive. Just means you CoH in the wizards when you are getting ready for the final boss NPC. You also have to be level 60 to use them. ]</i></font><br><br>I know exactly how the bane spells work. That 'select group of creatures' are exactly the creatures that take a long time to kill. They are the creatures where the wizard has the greatest problems, and is the exact group of combats that we wanted to target. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Isn't now, hasn't been in the past, probably won't be in the future. Just because you are the 'best' at travel does not mean that travel is what you do best." <br><br>Cool. <br><br>:)<br><br>-Alch ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, I've received a lot of comments that were much less&#8230; polite that Alch's comment. I'm not going to repost them here. But I'll address their concerns. <br><br>Too frequently folks get caught up in their current concern and don't step back to look at the big picture (I hate the phrase, someone get me a new one&#8230;). If we do something that allows Wizards to crank out the damage on high hit point NPCs in any way other than bane spells, then the life expectancy of old world NPCs would be nil. Improve the ratios of damage for Wizard spells to make them effective in the places where they feel weak now, and they destroy the old world with but a thought. <br><br>And I've noted that every (and I mean EVERY) person that has sent in some numbers showing how their wizard can't do the damage of a melee character sends in data comparing them to a rogue that has Ragebringer and is constantly backstabbing? Is that a good comparison? Keep in mind that the rogue is a three person damage dealer. He needs a tank and someone to heal that tank to do his damage. It might be fairer to add the damage dealt by all three of those people in a fight and divide by three, then compare&#8230; <br><br>The problem is that we're comparing melee and spell damage, and that's not a good comparison. The two are very different. <br><br>Group desirability is the other thing that is most mentioned about Wizards. They say they aren't. I argue that if there were no complaints about your ability to deal damage, then there would be no problem getting groups&#8230; But we also have plans that will dramatically reduce the problem with getting groups at higher levels. I can't tell you about it until we get it working and until we're done with the balancing stuff, but it will make a wizard desirable to groups. <br><br>I hate to say this, but it might be possible that part of the reason that a wizard might not be getting invited to groups is that you've spent so much time telling everyone how you aren't useful&#8230; It's hard to tell the sequence of events here, it's a chicken and the egg thing. But I often worry that this might be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Tell enough people that you're not useful and they will believe you. <br><br>This may not be true, but I worry about it nonetheless. <br><br>I received and e-mail from a friend this morning, saying many of the things that many of you have said. He said something though, that struck a cord with me. He mentioned something about Wizards in literature and how they are something to be feared. <br><br>They sure are. But, well, Gandalf isn't a balanced character. He can't exist in Norrath because then there would be a majority of these literature-based character class and few of the others. Tolkien never needed to balance gameplay with Mithrandir in mind. We do. <br><br>I know that what I've been saying sounds like I don't understand your point of view. But my concern here is that you don't see mine. There is more to balancing a class than just turning up the damage volume until everyone that plays that class is happy. It's not that easy. <br><br>Keep sending in your comments, we'll read them all. But for now I'm not going to make more comments on balance issues until we're done with our run through of all the classes.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000112.html"><b>Special Food Items</b></a><br>Nynfolyn wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I may be mistaken, but so far I have been unable to eat any food by right-clicking on it if the food is in a bag. If its in my main inventory there is no problem. Is this intentional, a bug, or my mistake? ]</i></font><br><br>You can't right-click anything that is in a bag. The idea is that something needs to be handy to use it, and you it isn't on hand if it's in the bag.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000117.html"><b>Luclin Content</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: When will you be adding content to the Luclin site? And when you do, will you post a message here? ]</i></font><br><br>Yes and yes. <br><br>Right now we're gearing up for E3. After that we hope to have an update for the site, but exactly when I'm not sure. But I'll definitely let you guys know when we do.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000161.html"><b>Faction Hits</b></a><br>Alavigne wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have a small question RE: faction hits. <br><br>If I'm a high elf & kill a Dark elf in his home hunting grounds I get bad faction with Dark Elfs. <br><br>If I am a high elf & kill a dark elf in my home hunting grounds do I get any positive faction hits? ]</i></font><br><br>Nope. The only faction hits for PvP on those servers will be killing a race in one of its home towns. No positive faction will be gained from PvP combat. <br><br>Unfortunately, giving anything positive at all for PvP combat tends to be abusable, since someone could simply have a friend create a character to kill to gain whatever benefit is given.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000162.html"><b>Travelers Boots</b></a><br>Saeul wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan: <br><br>You need to acknowledge the level of desparation that people feel regarding the Journeyman Boots and the Traveler's Boots. People have been frustrated beyond words at the additional barriers and frustration put in their way. You need to acknowledge it and explain WHY it's being done, not just say 'that is the way it is'. <br><br>It is NOT the way it is, it is the way Verant has DESIGNED it to be. Explain why. An explanation could go like this: <br>*beginning of one suggested dialog*<br>Folks I wanted to take a moment to have a short dialog with you on the Journeyman Boots/Traveler's Boots situation. We recognize that this one quest has continued to be a sore spot and we are taking an action that we hope will improve the situation. <br><br>On the one hand, it isn't fair to everyone who spent time and effort getting Journeyman Boots have their accomplishment trivialized. On the other hand, just money isn't, by itself, a sufficient 'effort' to replace the JBoots quest. So we made two decisions that you now see: <br><br>1. You must have faction to buy the boots. This affects those who hunted for Melatite, Charred Guardian Shields, etc. If you perceive your faction is SO BAD that you'll never qualify to buy the Traveler's Boots, then you are no worse off than you were--you can still do the Journeyman Boots quest. <br><br>2. You do not get as good of an item. The Traveler's Boots are somewhat inferior to the Journeyman Boots. This was intentional and is done to avoid the problem of trivializing other people's efforts. <br><br>In closing, I hope you see that we do care about our playerbase and we are trying to make the game more accessible without making it 'easy'. That is a difficult trade off and we're just people making tough decisions about how those trade offs work. Please allow us the latitude to come up with these ideas and try them out. <br><br>Trust us that we are trying really hard to keep the big picture in sight.<br><br>*end of suggested dialog*<br><br>Clearly this kind of discussion COULD cause more problems than it solves, but with your control of the message board, I doubt you'll actually find that negative of a response. ]</i></font><br><br>What he said&#8230; <br><br>Actually, that's pretty close to the truth. <br><br>Traveler's Boots are, however more than somewhat inferior to Journeyman's Boots. Because of the casting time they can not be used while moving. Because of that they won't be very useful as tools for kiting, and they will, primarily, be useful for travelling. <br><br>But most of what you say is true. I guess the problem here is that I thought those points were rather obvious (as they seem to be to you), so I didn't specify them very clearly. <br><br>And I don't think I ever said that they are as they are just because they are that way. I thought I was pretty clear that we put them there on purpose, not that they fell there by random chance. I'm not sure how you got the impression that I was even suggesting that they were placed in game by fate or some other such thing. No, we put them there and we did it on purpose. We thought out the ramifications and are content with them. <br><br>I'm sorry if I sounded equivocal about that, because we certainly are not. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Two more points: <br><br>3. Traveler's Boots aren't as desirable as Journeyman's Boots, since they have a casting time <br><br>4. For the price of Traveler's Boots, I could buy a *lot* of SoW potions. Suddenly the price of a SoW potion seems pretty reasonable to me... <br><br>-Azlina Crafte [Ebony Order]<br><br>The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks. <br><br>We understand the concern that some people have over the possibility of harm to the salability of Blood of Wolf potions. We don&#8217;t think that this will be a problem, we think that the sales of these potions might drop a little, but that they will still be valuable and salable. The truth is that nobody knows what will happen until it happens. So let's see how it goes.</UL>

This is a reminder of the maintenance SOE will be conducting in a couple of days:<UL><b>Guild Maintenance Coming May 15  </b><br> <br>On May 15th we will be performing another servers-wide guild wipe for any guild with less than ten members. Remember, it is always a requirement to have ten members in your guild. These ten members must all be characters from separate accounts (only one member from each account will be counted for the ten member total). <br><br>So if your guild does not have ten members on Tuesday, May 15th, it will be deleted. <br><br>We're sorry for being so harsh about this rule, but there is a distinct limit to the number of guilds that we can support, and the rules for maintenance of a guild are clear.  </UL>
