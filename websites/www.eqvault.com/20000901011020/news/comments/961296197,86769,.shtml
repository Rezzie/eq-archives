<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email cralis@home.com end_email start_name Rupert end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Problem #1: Death means very little.<br>Excuse me? That entirely depends upon the number of hours you play per day. That was one of the final straws that made my decision to quit. I played only 5 hours a week, and each death I had at level 20 basically set me back the ENTIRE WEEK.<br><br>Ahem. Anyways, on to the real issue.<br><br>Problem #2: That isn't allowed by the EULA.<br>Gordon, please tell me your not so stupid that you actually believe you could enforce the EULA in a court of law? A single element of _one_ EULA has been enforced in the entire history of software EULA or license cases, and none that require the consistent affirmation (with or without changes) has ever been enforced.<br><br>The reason? Because the courts know that what you put in there: A&gt; isn't read by the person using it, becuase B&gt; they can't read it until AFTER they purchase the game, and C&gt; anything that changes goes unnoticed without a full disclosure with the purpose of alerting the person.<br><br>Not to mention that the player has so much invested that if the EULA were to become so restrictive that you'd effectively have stolen so much from the person with that person having no ability to regain it.<br><br>In any case, the person bought the game and according to purchasing rights he can let anyone he sees fit use it. That is the law. You cannot change it.<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Mitsuwa end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->To #5 and #8, long story short, the EULA does cover Verant on this. You say it is unreasonable and unrealistic for a person to read that everytime they play. You are right. If you are the only person playing your character, you know what it says when you click 'I accept' so you don't need to read it everytime. However, but clicking 'I accept', you are therefore saying you agree with everything that is written there. If your friend just clicks on it to move on to the logon screen, you are responsible for any actions that occur. Talking about courts updholding the EULA is completely a waste of time because the moment you click 'I accept', you have for all intents and purposes signed a contract for that time you are playing. To say that the courts realize that people don't read those things and therefore will side with the person is ridiculous to say the least. Also, Verant would not have to enforce the EULA in a court of law. The person who felt they were wronged would have to provide a case against Verant and all they would have to do is say, this person clicked 'I accept' to this agreement. Case Closed.  <br><br>As for the GM screwing this person over, I hope it didn't happen. If it did, that stinks and the GM should be reprimanded. However, it would be nice if the guy had some screenshots or could even remember the GMs name (who he wsa in constant contact with for almost 4 hours-you would think that the you would remember that name right away). <br><br>Mitsuwa<!--ktalk end_comment-->

That is the law. You cannot change it. <br><br>Sorry to say this isn't true. What you bought was the software for the game (which you cannot use as a standalone piece-unless you want to keep playing the tutorial). When you create an account, that account is yours and yours alone-you are 'renting' the ability to log on and play their game. The one who owns the account is the only one that can play the game. And please don't say that according to purchasing rights, anyone can use it. If you buy a car-you own it. Could you let anyone you want drive it? The answer is no-that 12 year next door can't use it because they don't have a license. <br><br>Also, you are right in a sense. You could lend your friend a copy of the game and he could play the tutorial all he wants. That is the piece of software that you own. You do not, however own the right to log on to their servers and play the game.

Gordon, you are a customer service dolt!  Mind you, the victim in this particular story may have trusted the wrong guy to play his character, but did you consider:<br><br>A) That groups of friends/family might buy and play one one account because they don't have the time to do much individually?<br><br>B) That friends sometimes play eachothers characters to help them out/get out of tight jams/level them up so all of a group of friends can play together?<br><br>C) That people pay good money to play good money to play this game, paying your salary in the process?<br><br>D) If Verant were so show some compassion and creativity to customer who do things like share accounts, which by the way does nothing to affect anyone else's ingame fun, you might have MORE paying customers?<br><br>E) That this kind of bureacratic legalism is practically, politically and judicially unenforceable?  Even if you had the resources to detect account sharing, which you don't, would you be willing to be known in the marketplace as the kind of organization that would prosecute these infractions?  Even if you were, do you seriously think the judicial system would take dozens/hundreds/thousands of seperate cases involving individuals paying $39.99 plus $10 a month seriously?  Class action isn't an option here, Gordon.<br><br><br>Even mentioning this policy in your response is laughable, Gordon.  If Verant has half a brain, they will remove any clauses restricting account/character sharing from the EULA right away.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Mitsuwa end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Thanks for responding Rupert but to be honest with you, I do not need to find a single case to prove my point. Everytime you click 'I agree' you have agreed to what they have printed there. You (as the purchaser of the software) are agreeing to use to that software on their servers. Have you even read the agreement when you first log in or did you just click yes and move forward? They state very clearly there what your rights are and that if you do not agree with it to speak to a CSR and seek a refund. Oh and yes..they do have a legal right to say who can use the program because-that's right-they own and maintain the servers you play the game on. Crying ignorance after you have agreed to something is something that make have worked with you were 7, but it doesn't hold up here. Please explain to me how once you have agreed to the rules they set forth in the opening screen, that you have any recourse? You can't because once you have agreed, you must abide by their rules.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email cralis@home.com end_email start_name Rupert end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Mitsuwa first Curious, I'll answer you below :-)<br><br>Mitsuwa, my point is that even though you click &quot;I agree&quot;, what you are agreeing to is NULL and VOID. It is almost completely UNENFORCEABLE. You can violate around 80% of that agreement and all they can do is cancel your account. <br><br>Emulate their game (its being done). Use a packet sniffer (you have to in order to find the information to emulate the game, fortunately they transmit information as text making really easy to get it). Have friends use the account. Talk negatively about them. Post crap about them all over the internet.<br><br>They can't stop you. Oh darn, they canceled my account... thats what the emulator is for :-)<br><br>According the United States Law, NO MATTER WHAT THEY PUT IN THE EULA, they cannot enforce it. Period. End of story. Doesn't matter if you agree. Legally they have no grounds from which they can prosecute you.<br><br>Curious:<br><br>There is something called &quot;process&quot; in the development of a program. Process is a set of procedures, habits, and &quot;processes&quot; that are designed to ensure that the development goes smoothly, has few errors, and is able to handle any problems that arise.<br><br>Most process is lumped under: code control (making sure you don't overwrite newer code), design control (making sure that your design elements don't override each other), test control (making sure you properly and thoroughly test for bugs and problems), document control (making sure you document your development properly so test control can do it's job, and so future developments on the same program can be done without overwriting, making mistakes, or re-writing something already done), and of course management (the process of making sure everything is covered).<br><br>Verant has very little of these. Case in point?<br><br>&quot;Ooops. We accidentally overwrote the new code in the last patch.&quot; (code control violation)<br><br>&quot;Oops. We didn't think about that.&quot; (design control violation)<br><br>&quot;We didn't test that part.&quot; &quot;We didn't find that obvious flaw in testing (such as the bard invisibility song allowing members to see each other, the first implementation of it didn't work, something that would have taken about 10 seconds tops to figure out)&quot; (test control violation)<br><br>&quot;We didn't realize that the new levitation changes would affect bard songs, despite the fact that their object is derived from the magic objects&quot; (document control violation)<br><br>&quot;You can't expect GZ to remember everything!&quot; (nope, thats what process is for...management violation)<br><br>Anyways my dislike of Verant stems from two things: 1. their disrespect and god-like attitude over the players, and 2. their crappy process and the fact that other companies in the industry are trying to become just like them.<br><br>What else is there? Look at AC for example. Why do you think that they have far fewer problems, fix far more bugs and make far more changes per patch, and always fix more bugs than they introduce in EACH PATCH?<br><br>Because Microsoft enforced process upon them. Its a good thing, one of the few good things about Microsoft.<br><br>Thats what I mean. Plus its loosly modeled after &quot;get milk. does the body good&quot; meaning that process is to software development as milk is to the body. Sorry for the long rant.<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I would be very surprise if they (or any game company) would ever actually sue someone or take someone to court for violating their EULA.  Verant has proved, however, that they use it as a legal, binding tool to cancel someones account.  <br><br>In this case, the EULA is doing exactly what they intended it to, and is 100% funtioning as designed.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Mitsuwa end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Thanks for responding Rupert and you make some good points. You are absolutely correct in that it is entirely unenforceable. Verant has no way of knowing whether or not you and everyone on your block is using your 'copy' and 'registration'. What they are doing (and Curious hit the bulleyes with the comments in #23)is telling you that you shouldn't do this, but if we find out that your are doing it, we will take action against you (be it cancel your account or what). This is what this entire discussion was about. You mentioned that based on your purchasing rights, anyway could use the game. The response to that was that, yes, you purchased the game itself and anyone of your friends could use it. That is where your 'purchasing rights' end. 'You' and only you as the customer subscribed to the game. Your purchasing rights do not come into play here since you did not purchase this, but rather 'rented' the ability to use their servers. As mentioned above, is it possible for someone to violate the EULA? You bet it is, however if they are able to find out you did so, they are not responsible for anything that happened to your character and it is within their rights to cancel your account. That is the sum of what I was saying. We might have to agree to disagree on this friend. <br><br>In response to #19, no you and your brother would not be violating the EULA. It states specifically that if the game is used in the same household by family members than it is acceptable. What it trys to prevent is a person buying a copy of the game and giving all his buddies the password to use.  <br><br>Safe travels folks<br><br>Mitsuwa<!--ktalk end_comment-->

That is what the &quot;conduct code&quot; is for. The EULA's _SOLE_ purpose is to protect them in court, or to allow them to take someone to court.<br><br>Mitsuwa, the area your talking about with the accounts is perfectly understandable. Where the EULA breaks down is outside of that, and that is where Verant is having trouble.<br><br>Specifically the two emulation programs underway that will be able to run player-run servers, and the packet sniffers that Verant cannot detect. Remember they tried to scan everyone? Players like to think that Verant stopped because the players objected - actually I have heard from knowledgeable industry people that they were served with letters of intent from several law firms (probably players LOL) stating that they could sue.<br><br>I could be wrong, but hey its likely. It could also be their lawyers having fits... YOU DID WHAT???? :-)<br><br>If anyone wants to debate my points, please feel free to mail me. Just remember to tell me who you are! <br><br>Oh and Curious, my slogan is based off the milk commercials &quot;Get milk.

The EULA, shrink wrap licenses, and any license that requires you to agree AFTER you've spent the money without being able to read the license first - its unenforceable for the most part. There are a few things that are usually enforceable, but most software company agreements are mostly unenforceable in a court of law.<br><br>Thats why a lot of the big guys are trying to get the UCITA law passed. PLEASE WRITE YOUR CONGRESSMEN AND TELL THEM NO! This law will end any consumer rights and give the corporations such as Microsoft and AOL the _RIGHTS_ to scan your drive, collect your information, put backdoors in to disable your programs if you don't comply - and then sue you if you disagree (specifically they can forbid you from saying anything negative about their program).<br><br>Imagine if you went to a FORD dealer and he said that:<br><br>A&gt; you aren't buying the car, just renting it for 12 months.<br>B&gt; your friends can't use it, and you can't sell it<br>C&gt; you cannot say anything negative or we can sue you<br>D&gt; if there is anything wrong that is our fault you can't sue us and deal with it sucker<br>and E&gt; we have an explosive built into the car, and if we think your violating A, B, or C we are going to detonate it. <br><br>Sucks to be you!<br><br>As Dogbert says, &quot;I'm so great, its me you hail.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Curious end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Rupert,<br><br>Please address my points regarding the recent lawsuits and legal actions taken against the guys who cracked the list of CyberNanny (or whatever).  There are also several lawsuits pending regarding the reverse-engineering of the Xing DVD player and the Dec-SYS (sp?) program.  All of these &quot;violations&quot; occured after the EULA was presented to the customer and agreed too, yet they're getting sued.  Obviously someone thinks that the EULA &quot;in general&quot; is quite binding.  <br><br>Your Ford analogy is another fallacy.  Slippery-slope argument.  <br><br>Let me try...<br><br>A) You buy a game that requires you to login to a company-run server.<br>B) You agree to not let anyone outside of your house use your account or password to play the game.<br>C) You let you buddy across the street install and play the game using your password.<br>D) Company finds out (how they find out is another issue) and cancels your account.<br>E) You have payed $50 for game plus 2 months of usage (rental) for a total of $70.<br>F) You sue company for the $70.<br>G) They point to EULA and tell you to go away.<br>H) You read the EULA and go away.<br><br>Peace.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Sorry not familiar with that terminology - which one is that? As for the analogy, it isn't mine. Its the one that was presented to (I think) the Illinois house of reps as to why this contradicts current purchasing rights law.<br><br>I didn't specifically address the other two cases because I am unfamiliar with them. Better to say nothing than to say the wrong thing.<br><br>I can however comment on the DECSS (and related) case. The case of the person getting sued over the DVD encryption is much different because the industry is pushing it as trade secrets and several other things, despite the shaky legal ground they stand on.<br><br>Remember years ago people reverse engineered the pc cpu and the law upheld it. Now I think the only difference is that the DVD industry is paying a lot of money hoping to mire the situation long enough that the law is forgotten.<br><br>It has nothing to do with any licenses. It has everything to do with them wanting to keep their secret. Even if it was done by someone who didn't sign any license they'd sue anyways. As far as I know the kid who decrypted it was under no such license.<br><br>As for you interpretation, your right that this is how the industry works now. But the point is that NO OTHER INDUSTRY is allowed to do what the software industry is doing.<br><br>Why should they be different? Why should they get to what is deemed illegal in any other consumer industry?<br><br>Thats the point.<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Curious end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->A variation of the slippery slope argument is taking examples and arguments to the extreme.  Reading your analogy about putting exposives in cars made me think this of this.  Perhaps I was a bit off kilter in using that term, but I do think your analogy was inaccurate.<br><br>You got off track by asking why the software industry should be different.  I have no opinion on that, I'm saying that they are different, and thus the EULA is legal and 100% effective in its intended purpose, in that it give Verant recourse to take action (cancel your account) if you violate the terms of the EULA.<br><br>My whole point was that in the above entries (5, 12, 20, etc.) you say that the EULA is &quot;almost completely UNENFORCEABLE&quot;, then you say, &quot;all they can do is cancel your account.&quot;  Again, I say that perhaps that is all they're looking to get out of the EULA.  If that is the case, then it seems to be 100% effective and legal.<br><br>You also state that, &quot;the person bought the game and according to purchasing rights he can let anyone he sees fit use it&quot;.  We have been primarily talking about who can actually use the game, but what about someone copying the game and passing it out.  This would violate the EULA.  Does &quot;purchasing rights&quot; allow this behavior?<br>If so, then why don't these rights apply to music albums, why can't I copy them and pass them out?<br><br>If not, then &quot;purchasing rights&quot; don't apply to all aspects of the EULA, making the EULA at least partially enforcable.<br><br>You're a thorough individual, so I don't need to ask you to address all my points.  Nothing annoys me more than when people selectively ignore parts of a post, but I know I don't have to worry about that with you.<br><br>Out.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email cralis@home.com end_email start_name Rupert end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Ok I've found out more about the fallacies. &quot;Slippery Slope&quot; is &quot;argueing that case A will lead to case B, with no evidence to show that it will do so&quot;<br><br>What your talking about is similar to &quot;Prejudicial Language&quot;, using emotive terminology to attach value to an arguement. What I did was use an extreme example to distinguish my point, something that many leadership authors tell you makes a point recognizable (Napolean Hill &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;, Don Phillips &quot;Lincoln on Leadership&quot;, and Les Giblin &quot;How to have confidence and power in dealing with people&quot; all have this point).<br><br>First and foremost: yes the software industry is being treated different from most others, but no the EULA is still not legal. By &quot;legal&quot;, I mean that it is upheld in a court of law. So far nothing anyone has said has resulted in legalities or legal proceedings, thus the existence of the EULA is moot.<br><br>Its interesting that you think the EULA is their &quot;strong-arm&quot; to allow them to cancel their account, when they have a &quot;player policy&quot; that does just that. <br><br>The only purpose a EULA serves is for legal action. More likely the EULA is a scare tactic for anyone who wants to take legal action over the player policies. <br><br>They basically merged their player policies into the EULA for legal effect, but the fact remains that there are only a few legal &quot;rules&quot; in the EULA, most simply being reiterations of existing law (you cannot copy this, you are renting an account, etc.) This is done so you know what laws apply.<br><br>Where they go wrong is when they add a bunch of stuff that isn't legal, hoping to limit you or at least scare you into doing what they want. So far this has been deemed illegal, but it is still daunting to the customer - especially an uninformed customer.<br><br>As for copying something, that is against the law in the same manner that photocopying a book and giving it to your friend is against the law. Forget the EULA - even without the EULA it is illegal. Some things aren't practical (such as &quot;copying&quot; your FORD truck), so they are never an issue, but others are and there are existing laws for those circumstances.<br><br>Software is where this becomes a grey area because the copy is nearly as good as the original. This is also the case with MP3 music, but note that in both cases the courts have upheld that the owner can maintain his own copies for his own use. <br><br>Of course this has to do with intellectual rights and beneficiary rights, and all sorts of other things designed to protect the maker's right to make money from their development/invention. <br><br>Anyways we can go round and round with this all day. The bottom line is that most EULA's have 2-4 legal &quot;rules&quot;, and anything else is an attempt to tread upon consumer rights, and even the Bill of Rights (such as saying what someone can say about your product - freedom of speech anyone?)<br><br>We'll see what happens over the next year. Pray to whatever God you pray to that the software industry is upheld to the standards other industries are already held to - otherwise they will become immensly powerful and able to override consumer, privacy, and personal rights. Hell, they already do it illegally...<br><br>(anyone remember Microsoft recording several million users unique network card identifiers and personal computer information without asking, by using registrations over the internet that the user was unaware of? if not, you should look it up. scary)<br><br>Rupert<br>Get process.
