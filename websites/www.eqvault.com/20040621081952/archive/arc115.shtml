<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
They say there's a "small" gathering of the game industry folk going on in good 'ole LA.  E3 or no E3, Gordon's been keeping extra busy posting on the Gameplay Board today with some interesting comments.  Here they are:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041611.html"><b>Enchanter Discussion</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Enchanters must quest to get 2 spells before level 49, no other class must do this to get thier spells...]</i><P> Questing is considered by many to be an advantage. For instance, I've seen more than a few complaints from rogues and druids complaining that they don't have the quests that some other classes do. <P><i>[Quote from original post: The Iksar Illusion Makes a low level enchanter attempt to kill mobs RED to him to fulfill this quest, no other class must do this...]</i><P> Many quests require a group to complete. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Class specific Items for enchanters... one that I have seen, all others that they can use are by all standards, and no new abilities have been added to this item unlike other classes...]</i><P> I don't quite understand what you are trying to say here. Can you rephrase?]</i><P> <P><i>[Quote from original post: Enchanters have to rely on more dropped spells than any other class, check the numbers and you will see it is true...]</i><P> How so? Do you mean pre-50 research components? It's quite possible, since enchanters have more spells than most other classes. <P><i>[Quote from original post: With Plane armor, the more a class is used in standard, i.e cleric, wizard, druid ect... the more likely the drop rate is higher... I have checked this in person on several servers... ]</i><P>Not true, however, even if it were, how is this a bias against enchanters? <P><i>[Quote from original post: There is a year old issue with the "slow" spells yet they have never been fixed...]</i><P> Shamans (and now some melee who have weapons that proc slowing spells) have to deal with this same issue. Are we biased against them as well? <P><i>[Quote from original post: Enchanters have been Nerfed for the betterment of other classes and not compensated as other classes are, and Enchanters DO NOT solo as well or as often as other classes...]</i><P> I can think of only one case where this has happened (weapon delay no longer affecting pets), and no compensation was given because we reevaluated our position on pets and the classes that use them and found that enchanters pets were overpowered, yet enchanters as a class were fine with the new changes. As for soloing, enchanters remain incredible soloers under specific circumstances, but you are primarily a group class as designed. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Enchanters in general are a utilitarian class, And I love them for that, however there is no support from verant to make us any better at it than what we are pre 50...]</i><P> I'm not quite sure what you mean here. Perhaps you could state some facts? <P><i>[Quote from original post: Enchanters are the silent class and seldom complain so verant sees them as easily silenced...]</i><P> Enchanters are "silent" because the they don't want to draw attention to themselves and how good they actually are. Much like necromancers, who hardly ever say anything except for the two weeks following a nerf. We know how good you are though :)<P><i>[Quote from original post: I am an Enchanter in the game, And YES this is a Verant is Bias Post...Enchanters are not treated equally nor are they considered in alot of the things that verant undertakes, Like the ROK expansion...]</i><P> I really don't think that you've shown that we have a bias against enchanters. Please ask yourself what point there would be in us having a devious bias against any class? I don't want to spend a whole lot of time on this thread since it is on the virge of class-envy, but I did want to explore the accusation of "bias". <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041481.html"><b>Wizard Nerf?</b></a><br>There's no bug or nerf here. Yonder and Shadowstep transport you a random distance in a random direction (but not through obstacles), with Yonder having a larger max-distance than shadowstep. I've had shadowstep TP me a full 15 second SoW'd run from the origin before. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041692.html"><b>Pets and Mana</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I can't beleive so many people took what Abashi said out of context. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a big fan of his when he is wrong, but this is different. His post said they DID NOT want to remove the uncertainty. IF they wanted to remove the uncertainty then they might do this but THEY DO NOT WANT TO REMOVE THE UNCERTAINTY. Let it go already...]</i><P> You are correct. The uncertainty is there for a reason, and it's not something that we want to eliminate.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041431.html"><b>Monk Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Hey gordon how about just a confirmation that Monk fists beyond lvl 50 actually get better. And how much better like a % base better than lvl 50. That way we have some numbers to test on. Right now fist damage looks to be staying the same.]</i><P> The delay of their fists continues to drop on the same formula as when they start getting faster. The damage of their fists do not get better post-50.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041240-4.html"><b>More Guard Buffing Issues</b></a><br>The buffed guards being able to see invis is a consequence of their new level. We might need to look at other options in the case that people can't take the guard-bypass routes at the two major ports on Antonica. <P>It's also apparent that there are a few guards who were buffed who shouldn't have been (some of the ones in Nektulos come to mind). We'll look into these as well.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041388.html"><b>Fizzling</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I have been a cleric for many many many levels now, and NEVER have any of my spells fizzled THIS much. Heroism fizzles a great deal, but the amount of fizzles I get with the 51st level heal spell remedy is astounding. It fizzles enough that I have shelved the spell because as a mana efficient alternative to superior heal it was failing due to the fizzle mana loss.]</i><P> We'll revisit the fizzle percentages. As I mentioned before, it is true that spells will fizzle a good deal on the level that you get the spell, but we might need to do something to take into account that spell skills don't go up. Also, we'll probably definitely need to take a look at the level 60 spell fizzle rates since no one will reach 61 to get the big reduction.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041302.html"><b>Bug in Kunark that Kills Heales/Peopler</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: This is an inadvertant (I think) side effect of the mobs not following a player if the player gets too far away. <P>Here's the chain of events:  <P>1) player engages a mob and gets on hate list. <P>2) player runs like a scared girl. <P>3) mob stops chasing and heads to it's home point. <P>4) on the way on the home, the mob tells all of it's friends to hate the player, thus putting the player on a billion hate lists.  <P>Now, this list gets extended for classes that heal or buff...  <P>5) evertime player heals or buffs, he builds hate with all those mobs whose hate list he is on. <P>6) when a mob that hates the player is pulled to the group, they charge the player they hate the most. ( the one who has been healing all the time )  <P>Incidentally, this also explains the seemingly random faction messages that are so prevailent in Kunark. <P>-adam_wasserman]</i><P>The poster adam_wasserman does a good job of explaining how it works. However, the event is probably starting due to a typo in at least one of the critter files, causing them to "yell for help" in a very large radius. This yell copies the critter&#8217;s hatelist to any other NPCs that hear the yell, who would take off after the most-hated person as soon as they come in range. <P>And yes it could explain the random faction message problem that a few have explained. <P>Please let me know what zone and types of critters have been reacting in this way. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041147-4.html"><b>Damage and Delay</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Every other class in the game has the dam/delay value on their weapons clearly available to them, and allows easy comparison between weapons. There are a whole load of new monk weapons coming out of Kunark, but we are unable to do any true comparisons to our fists, because we simply dont know what the values on our fists are.]</i><P> That's a pretty sound argument, but we'll still leave it up to the player to get an idea of how much damage they are doing. It's one of the last great mysteries of the game :)Now that there are some viable monk-weapons out there, monks will have to determine on their own whether they provide more of a advantage than their fists. We don't want to hand the info out. I will tell you that that there are some weapons out there that are better for the monks at one level and worse for them at another. For instance, there is a weapon that would improve a level 50 monk, but hinder a level 60.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040545.html"><b>Availability of Cannibalize II Spell: Not in game yet?</b></a><br>I'll check into it and hopefully get back with you on Monday. </UL>

Eanin Cuendillar pointed me to an<a href="http://www.latimes.com/print/20000512/t000044865.html"> interesting article on the LA Times</a> about people who became addicted to EverQuest and games like it.  To cap off the article the writer includes a test to see if your addicted.  Here's a quote:<UL>For the better part of nine months, Dan Gilbert of Red Lion, Pa., lost his wife, Lori, to an Internet game called "EverQuest." <br><br>     Each day Lori, 35, retreated to her computer in the basement and dove into the online sword-and-sorcery world, surfacing only to sleep and grab a quick bite to eat. Her computer log showed she played an average of 65 hours a week, eclipsing every activity in her life, including sleep. <br><br>     "It was like we were in different worlds," Dan Gilbert said. "She didn't do much of anything except play that game." <br><br>     It was only after Gilbert threatened to leave the marriage, he said, that his wife agreed to end her Internet game life and return to the real world.<br> <br>     "I was so emotionally drained at that point, I broke into tears," said Gilbert, a 35-year-old Web designer and an online game player himself. </UL>Click on the link above for the rest.

Uglar brings us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe this was a spur of the moment gathering of people in the City of Mist.

<a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid958085031,4788,">Rare Spawns</a> is the subject of the latest Player View to be featured.  This article is a start to what will hopefully be an interesting <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5620110">debate</a> on this very controversial issue.  Here's the beginning note of this article:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>Rare Spawns. <br><br>Those single two words have sparked issues of incredible size. Play-nice rules, E-Bay, and many other problems have cropped up simply because some spawns (Fishbone Earring, JBoots, Erudin Library Book) are far too rare for their own good. Why is this? No one here wants to wait 8 hours before a part of a needless quest pops. No one wants to deal with people who time their kills. </i></BLOCKQUOTE>As with any Player View we have a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5620110">special Discussion Thread</a> started on the boards for you to express your opinions, ideas and comemnts about this issue.<br><br>Thanks goes out to Jace for writing this bit and sending it to us.<br><br>Enjoy!

Gordon's holding down the fort while e3 rages on.  Here's a new post I just spotted on the Gameplay Board in response to a player's post dealing with future MMORPGs such as UO2.  *cough* I mean Ultima Worlds Online: Origin.  Here's the post:<UL>with some of the screenshots i have seen, and the fact that they have a strong roleplaying player base..i don't see the reason why i shouldn't just take my ten dollars a month somewhere else....not mind me i don't want to quit everquest, if it came down to it i would have two acounts one on UO2 and one on EQ...But really with the advacements in graphics, a new graphics engine, a larger online player base, everything that EQ offers and more, i am going to have problems deciding which one to play more...depends on which one is more adictive really.<br><br><b><i>First it was RPGs. Then it became FPSs. Then RTSs. Now the hot market is MMOGs, and specifically MMORPGs. <br><br>There are a bunch of them in development, and who's to say how many of them will actually ship, but one thing that is certain is that each will embrace newer technology and try to improve upon earlier games by other developers. Someday someone (hopefully us:) will release a game that tops EQ. No doubt some of the games coming out will be very good. No doubt some (hopefully not released by us:) will lack that "certain something" that makes EQ great. <br><br>In the end it is the players that choose the direction that the genre goes. Desired traits will evolve from game to game, and undesirable ones will fade out. I guess what I'm saying is is that if a better game than EQ comes out and you end up switching to it, we won't hold you at fault, we'll go make a newer better game :)<br><br>-Gordon</i></b></UL>

Simmiir sends us the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>[Faydark Census; Nominations to begin soon!]<br><br>Hail, one and all.<br><br>For those of you who are Elven-kind. For those of you who lay claim to the expansive Faydark wood as your homestead. For those of you that hold a place in your heart for Felwithe's marbled brilliance, or a memory of Kelethin's hardened roots. -Come hither, for herein lies a bulletin of the utmost importance to you:<br><br>Soon, nominations will be called for regarding the taking of seats on the pronounced eleven position "Faydark Council". This council, as a whole, is to serve as a governing body of law for those registered as citizens of Kelethin and Felwithe, as well as the Greater and Lesser regions of the Faydark forest. The "Faydark Council" will consist of the two small-bodied, five seat, councils of Kelethin and Felwithe. In addition to governing within their own respective city limits, these two councils will commit to overseeing the Faydark lands as a whole, together, with the mediating efforts of a single High Chancellor. Once the seats of the two city councils have been filled by both nomination and election, the High Chancellor will be nominated from among them, as an "alternate" is seen into the then vacant city council position. This serving as a brief synopsis, let us continue with this important notice.<br><br>Presently, as a final step of preparation before nominations begin, a "Faydark Census" is taking place. Located in the "Faydark" alcove of the "Collective of Fennin Ro Discussion Hall", this census will exist for as long as it is needed, -but should be brief. The purpose of which, is to heighten awareness before our important next step, and strengthen our numbers with the intent of being able to produce the thorough voting and nomination process that Faydwer rightly deserves! -And demands of us.<br><br>With this, we ask that you pay us a visit. You may come as a prospective nominee, a representative of your Guildhouse, or a common citizen. It matters not. What does matter, however, is your very presence. The procedure is not strenuous, and a simple nod or wave of your staff will mark you as present. Once a sufficient amount of supporters have come forth, nominations will be taken for the two Elven cities, and an election held. We urge, and beseech of you all kindly, to come forth. And better yet, encourage others to make the journey with you. -It is the fate of your land that is being decided. There has been no better time!<br><br>Directions to the Hall are to follow at the bottom of this notice.<br><br>Warmest regards and my greatest appreciation for your efforts in advance,<br><br>Pilloch Cle'Simmiir<br>Tal Kor ~ Order of the Pegasus<br>Tal Kor ~ Ambassador to the Collective<br><br>----------<br>Directions:<br><br>The Collective of Fennin Ro forum listing is available at:<br><a href="http://www.sok.org/cgi-bin/fenninro/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">http://www.sok.org/cgi-bin/fenninro/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro</a><br><br>If you choose to post, please quickly update yourself on where the discussions are by viewing the "State of the Union - Faydark" topic under the "Common Law" forum which you'll find at the above link. It is a brief read and will give you a fine understanding as to what has been accomplished thus far, and a more detailed look at the information provided in the above notice.<br><br>"The Faydark Census" is taking place in the "Faydark" forum you will also find at the<br>link above. The Felwithe and Kelethin forums are no longer being used at this time, as discussions for both cities have been focused here.

Another patheticly lame scam is going around.   Here's one of the reports I received from Zemmenar:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail,<br><br>One of my guildmembers recieved the following e-mail, which obviously a<br>scam. I just thought I would tell us guys.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Lord Zemmenar<br><br><br><UL><i>Greetings. I am Head GM Tarn and i have some information that concerns your<br>account. Now this is fairly serious so lets get right down to it. THIS IS<br>NOT A SCAM BTW. Verent has your account to be destroyed due to your auction<br>on ebay. This is where i come in.. I am here to help you. I have worked for<br>Verent with the EQ game since it started and i have put up with his sjkad<br>for a long time now and he has went to far when he decided to destroy<br>accounts due to the selling/trading. So if you truly want to save your<br>account here are some suggestions.<br><br>1: Take your bid off ebay ASAP and try changing the password to something<br>else. This method doesnt ensure that you will keep your account active.<br><br>2: Try just taking your bid off ebay and staying off line for about 1 week<br>or so... This is the most unefficent way to save your accout. OR<br><br>3: I know this sounds just like the MOTD(message of the day) That is posted<br>when you log in but this is like almost 90-99% most efficient to save your<br>account. I need both your station name and password so i can change ALL the<br>information on your account.<br><br>Now lets start with the basics, Why a station name and password? So i can<br>get into your account and change your characters names and this is most<br>important. I need to change your station name. Thats right STATION name.<br>That is what verent most bases his destruction on. Why? Well thats simple<br>that is the one thing that the average player can't change with out some<br>help. Now you may elect to contact customer service and have them change it,<br>But they wont. Not because they cant but because they have been instructed<br>not to. This is up to you so be patient on your decision. Now remember this<br>100% all the time while deciding what to do. THIS IS NOT A SCAM. If you<br>really want your account to make some money for you on ebay then i suggest<br>you do one of these methods. Either 1,2, or 3.<br><br>Thanks and stay in contact.<br><br>Head GM Tarn.</i></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Remember, reps from Verant and Sony will <b>never</b> ask you for your password.

A new message was added to the EQ Patch Server yesterday:<BLOCKQUOTE>May 10th, 11:00am<br>-------------------<br><br>*Newbie Guards*<br><br>As we are sure many people are aware, there are guards that exist specifically for the purpose of giving new characters a place to run in order to be saved from a certain death. However, as many people have mentioned, these guards are frequently either dead, or engaged by players choosing to hunt them. This makes things very frustrating for newer players, and with the large influx of new players due to the release of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, we decided that a change was warranted.<br><br>Though we do not have a problem with players choosing to hunt guards, the newbie guards themselves, specifically the ones at the gates of cities and in the vicinity of newbie zones, need to remain alive under most circumstances. To that end, we have buffed up these newbie-protecting guards, made them immune to magic, and given them some pretty good healing properties, in order to make them less attractive to people hunting them. <br><br>In addition, though we have left the guards inside cities as-is from the perspective of power, we've also found a problem with the respawn rate. Previously they were typically on a six-minute timer, making them spawn much faster than an equivalent NPC would in a dungeon. We have normalized the respawn time of guards inside cities to bring them in line with dungeon NPCs. <br><br>Thank you,<br><br>The EverQuest Team<br><br><br>** Shipping Update ** We believe all orders that we have recieved (and successfully billed) have been shipped out and should be recieved within 3-6 business days. <br>If you are unhappy with that delay, you may cancel your order and recieve a full refund by emailing <a href="mailto:kunarkrefund@verant.com">kunarkrefund@verant.com</a>. <br>If you have any questions you may call the phone number listed in the Kunark FAQ on <a href="http://www.everquest.com">http://www.everquest.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>

Here's today's edition of the Gordon Infobits, a compilation of quotes and excerpts made by Verant's Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040980.html"><b>20+ Fallacies I See Every Day</b></a><br>Wow, thanks for posting this. I've been guilty of a few of these myself from time to time. I hope everyone reads this and keeps it in mind, it should help us communicate and debate more efficiently in the future.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040931.html"><b>Outposts</b></a><br>In the first line of the quote, I should have said "outposts" (meaning both FV and the evil outpost), not "outpost". The guild masters and bankers were placed in the outposts during beta since the Kunark beta testers were not allowed to leave to go back to their home towns. <P>These should have been removed before it went live, but that didn't happen. In any case, as I said before, we probably won't remove them at this point.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040992.html"><b>Experience - Outdoors & Dungeon</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: There is a multiplier for xp. Outdoor xp is much lower than indoor or dungeon xp]</i><P> Actually I thought this was fairly well known. I wouldn't say "much lower", but it is lower. <P><i>[Quote from original post: The guards being changed from 6 and 8 minute spawns to 20 minute spawns is purly in the interest of Verant wanting people to team in dungeons and play their game the way they see it. This nurf has nothing to do with newbies or protecting younger players]</i><P> I never said that the spawn time change had anything to do with newbies. That's what the gate-guard change is for. The spawntimes were changed to be based upon level rather than a default 6-8 minute timer because inner cities were more attractive for hunting than dungeons were. <P>We don't mind if you hunt in the cities, but it shouldn&#8217;t be more lucrative than hunting in a dungeon.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040922.html"><b>Changing Titles</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: An enchanter gets to go through Illusionist (which isn't that bad, except we don't get any illusions after lvl 44), Beguiler (which is something we do, but sounds real stupid), and finally to spend the rest of our time in eq at lvl 60 as a Phantasmist (this title is neither pleasant nor befitting the class at all).]</i><P> We actually though Phantasmist was one of the coolest level 60 titles out there. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Is there a chance that the Titles for 51+ can be changed?]</i><P> We're considering making some gender-specific changes, but that's about the extent of it. This is one of those subjects that is very subjective, and I doubt that we can give everyone exactly what they are looking for.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040920.html"><b>Evolving Factions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Could it ever be the case that factions change? Couldn't it stand to reason, that at some point, the dark elves would form an alliance with the Iksar. Or, even better, how about a quest, which, when completed, allows faction alignments to be dynamically altered. Factions are fine, but for them to NEVER change is just not realistic.]</i><P> We have the ability to do this, but the door would swing both ways and people get very upset when they become KOS in an area that they used to be able to go through unmolested. As a result, we've left the global faction issues the same in most applications. <P>The closest thing we've done to changing something in this fashion was the update to Kithicor. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Also, When a god such as Cazzic or Inorruuk is killed, shouldn't those characters that worship him suffer in some way-such as a innate decrease to magical resistance, or stats, etc. Shouldn't there be vast worldwide consequences when a god dies?]</i><P> Possibly, but before we could do that we'd probably have to put up a "Plane of Love" or something along those lines to give people another option. <P>Also keep in mind that Innoruuk is the god of Hate. What better way for a follower of hate to prove himself than to slay his own god? :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040918.html"><b>Does a NPC being immune to magic also make them immune to rogue poison?</b></a><br>Yes it would. It would also make them immune to melee attacks that empart a magical consequence. For instance, "Instill Doubt" might land, but the "fear" part of it would be resisted.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040917.html"><b>Immune to Magic</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I would like to know what exactly Abashi meant when he said they were making the newbie guards "Immune to magic". Does this mean they can't be hit by Magic based spells only? Or does this mean that they can not be hit by any spells, i.e. no spells casted on them will take effect?]</i><P> They will be immune to all harmful spells. Another passing NPC could certainly cast buffs on them though. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040739.html"><b>Group Linking & Experience Sharing Not Impossible!</b></a><br>I didn't say that it wasn't possible, just that it wasn't feasible. Given that there is no way that we can implement every suggestion that is made, and given that we have to prioritize where we want to concentrate our efforts, sometimes it makes more sense for us to concentrate our efforts in other areas, such as adding content/quests/etc., to the game. This is espicially true when the effort required to implement a particular suggestion is in excess of the benefit that it would bring. <P>We don't want to link groups for the reasons above. The amount of effort that it would require to make that change, including redesigning the entire grouping engine, experience allocation routines, and accounting for every permutation of things that can happen in relation to the group is time that we would rather spend doing something that would affect more people than this will. The entire game is built around groups of six, with very few encounters requiring larger groups. Furthermore, the fact that any shared experience at the level that people typically attack things that require more than one group would require dozens of slayings of those particular encounters in order to move the experience bar with a group size of say 12. The benefit for doing this is much less than the effort that would be involved to implement the suggestion. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi in 19 of 20 posts i can read that you have decided this or that without ever asking any player out there ]</i><P>People post their opinion on this board. For cases where we are willing to consider doing something based upon player input, we frequently ask for specific opinions here on the board. Quite often, if it will enhance gameplay, and we've decided to do it, we'll just wait until it's implemented before announcing it. For example, the change to meditation so higher level magic users don't have to look at their spell books any longer was a good example of this. Messages to the caster that indicate spells wearing off was another. <P>However, there are suggestions that are made that we have no intention of implementing. This does not mean that the suggestion isn't any good, quite frankly they are often very good. However given that resources are finite, and that the core engine of the game is "done", there's really no point to solicit specific opinion in these cases. <P>Please, by all means continue to make suggestions. If its a good idea, and it's something that we can reasonably plan on and put in EQ, when we can seriously consider it. If it's a good suggestion but there is no way that it will work for EQ, we'll keep it in mind for future products that we develop. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040683.html"><b>Enchanting Items Issue/Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: So in essence if I am reading this right Enchanters will NEVER be able to enchant items to proc a level spell etc. So are you going to let us do ANYTHING to items or is Verant planning to never give Enchanters the promised ability of item enchantment?]</i><P> It's certainly possible that we could enhance trade-skills to make use of enchanted metal or the vials of mana (from the thicken series) like Wu's Fighting Gauntlets, however the ability to take a mundane item and magically imbue it is not planned at present.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040616.html"><b>Pet Request</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: It would remove lots of guesswork on a pet's level. It would be most helpful when you're facing a 'high risk' creature such that a good quality pet will give you a definite edge and there is no 'greenie' creature for you to determine the quality of the pet.]</i><P> There's supposed to be some guess work involved. That's why the summoned pets have a level range that they can be. If we wanted everyone to be able to determine with certainty what level their pet is, we could just double the mana requirement and have it summon the best pet every time. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040598.html"><b>Experience Penalty</b></a><br>I've answered a large number of posts on this subject. It's a revolving topic, much like melee binding, that comes up about once a month or so. <P>Some classes require more experience than other classes to level, just as some races require more experience than others. There are a few reasons why this is done, but it basically comes down to a way to discourage everyone from playing the same race/class combo. <P>Experience requirements are what they are, and are not subject to post-production changes. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040495-2.html"><b>Spell Fizzling</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Hi Abashi or whomever at Verant can find the time to help me out with a question.I am a level 52 cleric with every single skill maxed out. But all of the new spells fizzle much more than it seems they should. Remedy is finally fizzling less after I hit level 52, but it still fizzles more than seems appropriate.]</i><P> The spells aren't fizzling any more than the level 49 spells did on the level you got them. On the level that you get any particular spell, your chance to fizzle the spell is pretty high. That chance decreases dramatically, but never goes away entirely, as you level.</UL>

Gordon gave what is presumablely the last word in the "melee-paying-an-npc-for-a-bind" issue.  Here's the word from the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>I'm sorry guys, but the binding issue is absolutely a dead horse, which is why I'm not jumping in the threads to remind everyone about that more than once a month or so. <br><br>The game has been out for over a year. In that time, melee characters have survived and prospered, even though the binding arrangements haven't changed. Melee characters will continue to thrive without implementing something such as this that would drastically change the pace of the game, game balance, class interdependency, and the penalty for death. <br><br>Binding is an advantage of being a pure caster in the same fashion that the ability to dish out melee damage, wear protective armor, etc., is an advantage of being a melee player. My advice to you is to make friends with clerics, wizards, druids, and anyone else who can make your travel go quicker. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Slandering the name of Tunare and slaughtering our kinsmen at the Rings must not be tolerated. We must make an assault on the forest of the Teir&#8217;Dal- Nektulos. This is not revenge- we cannot stoop to their level. Rather, we are defending our beliefs and ourselves, not only we Druids, but all followers of light. In the name of Tunare, Karana, and all benevolent gods we strike back!"<br><br>OOC: What: Attack on Nektulos Forest (Fennin Ro)<br><br>When: Friday, May 19th at 8:00 pm Eastern Time<br><br>Where: We will gather at the entrance to Nektulos in the East Commonlands prior to the assault.<br><br>Who should go: Younger adventurers can attend this event, presuming we have help from higher levels to take out the Dragoons and other high level mobs. Still, it will be quite dangerous for levels under 14. This event it sponsored by the Druid Order, but we&#8217;ll need all the help we can get!<br><br>Other info: If you plan to attend please email <a href="mailto:dinoguy2@yahoo.com">dinoguy2@yahoo.com</a>.

Here's another round of posts and excerpts by Gordon Wrinn taken from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040653.html"><b>No More SoulFire?</b></a><br>Lucan could be killed before the change without killing the gate guards, you'll still be able to do it. Guards that are meant to be killed for the purpose of a quest haven't been changed.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040654.html"><b>Spells & Drop Rates</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Please increase the drop rate because of the 170 NPCs you claim CAN drop the spell, it seems that none of them are doing so.]</i><P> Yes, I said that over 170 NPCs have the ability to drop the spell, but I didn't say that people were killing the correct 170 NPCs :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040661.html"><b>Client Issue</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I've tried to figure out the timing--ie if weapon delay is 40, and bow delay is 45, I give it extra time before using the bow after turning off attack Still, though, I've found that I have to wait at LEAST one full recycle before I can use the bow again--even if the bow has a faster delay than my weapon! (ie, a Brutechopper with a 1-cam darkwood.)]</i><P> Interesting problem. It sounds like a client issue. I'll mention it to the client guy when I see him.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040673.html"><b>Grouping and Taking Down Creatures</b></a><br>There aren't many creatures out there that require more than one group to kill. <P>Even with those that exist, there's not really enough of them to make a noticeable impact on the experience bars of the people who do get experience. The experience from one (or even 10 kills) at the level that you are hunting critters that require more than 6 people really isn't going to make much of a difference. <P>People hunt things that require more than 6 people to kill for the excitement and the loot, not really for the experience. I guess the point I am making is that we are probably better off focusing our efforts on developing new content and addressing some outstanding problems rather than allocating resources to implement something that will only affect a small group of players, and even then, only affect them marginally.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040647.html"><b>Foraging</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Normally I would agree that "you gotta look around" however since I can forage rabbit on the boat in the middle of OoT I should be able to find berries while sitting on my butt.]</i><P> ACK! You've found the dreaded aqua bunnies! Seriously though, forage is intended to be a bit of an active skill, so you have to be standing :)<P><i>[Quote from original post: Besides who's to say I didn't look around to find a berry bush to sit next to?]</i><P> Well you couldn't have found the bush without foraging, but once you've foraged then there's no more berries on the bush for you to pick while sitting :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040613.html"><b>Spell Scrolls</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Ok the real point of this topic. If at level 12 a magic user could scribe a bind scroll he could sell it to warriors so they could bind themself in town only. And could only carry one because of it being lore. This would still promote the interaction with charecters, but one take some of the hassle out of getting a bind.]</i><P> Spell scrolls don't work this way. What you are basically describing is how a potion works, and potions can only be made via the Alchemy skill. Though it may not contain all of the potions that people wish for, it's the only way expendable spell-casting items can be created. <P>Since we don't allow anyone to create anything of value without some effort, opening some way for magic users to create expendable spell-casting items would basically have it working in the same fashion as alchemy, a skill that we want to keep as a benefit only for Shaman.</UL>

From Zifeer:<BLOCKQUOTE>Help wanted!<br> <br>I was browsing through the <a href="http://www.RallosZek.net">http://www.RallosZek.net</a> OOC board, over the last couple of pages and it occurred to me that although lots of folks regularly discuss PvP Tactics at great length, no one had ever sat down and tried to write some sort of definitive PvP Tactics Guide.<br> <br>So I thought maybe this would make a useful resource, both for newer players to PvP, and for more experienced folks wanting to start new characters with unfamiliar classes.<br> <br>Now I'd be the first to admit, I suck at PvP. Plus, I only have a basic familiarity with a few classes and how they work. So what I'd really like, is for those of you out there who know which end of the sword goes in the enemy, to lend me a hand.<br> <br>I'm looking for maybe three or four smallish (Around or under 500 words) guides to PvP combat, for each class. (Warrior, Druid, Shadowknight, etc) These should include tips and tactics on how each should best deal with the various other types of opponent (Healer, Tank, Caster, etc) and how to cope in a variety of situations, (Ambush(Either end of), Duel, 1 on 1, 1 on 2 or Pets, group PvP, etc)<br> <br>I'm not so much interested in what Verant should do for the Warrior or the Wizard so much, but more how best to use what each class has as things are now. I'd ideally like something to cover different level ranges too; I imagine a level nine Monk fights quite differently to a level forty-nine Monk. Some variety here would be useful too, allowing for a Beginners Guide and a Masterclass for each, perhaps.<br> <br>I'm not interested in motives either, it doesn't matter if you're a PK, Anti-PK or whatever; as long as you are good at PvP, I'd love to hear from you. This is purely intended to be a guide to PvP Combat, with no moral strings attached.<br>(Although try to avoid excessive gloating, etc; just the facts :)<br> <br>Similarly, I'm not too interested in PvE Tactics either; many other guides detail the best way for a Bard to take out an Orc Pawn and so on.<br> <br>I'm quite happy to proofread/spellcheck/format-for-presentation anything anyone wants to submit, and the best, most informative submissions will go to make up the guide. Full credit will be given to all articles I use, (Unless you'd rather submit anonymously, which is fine too :)<br> <br>Hopefully once all compiled, the finished work can go on <a href="http://www.ralloszek.net">http://www.ralloszek.net</a> somewhere, for future generations of young Zekers to study and learn from. (As well as providing material many interesting message board threads, no doubt! :)<br> <br>So if you've developed a useful or effective technique, or think you have mastered your class, and want to share it with others, please jot it down and mail it to me at...<br> <br><a href="mailto:zifeer@ralloszek.net">zifeer@ralloszek.net</a><br> <br>(If you've specialized in more than one class, don't be afraid to write one for each, the more the merrier!)<br><br>Thanks for your help all!<br>Zifeer</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Verant's Internet Relations Manager Gordon Wrinn <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040309.html">started a new thread</a> on the Gameplay Board regarding Newbie Guards found in Norrath.  Here's the first post in this thread:<UL><i>As we are sure many people are aware, there are guards that exist specifically for the purpose of giving new characters a place to run in order to be saved from a certain death. However, as many people have mentioned, these guards are frequently either dead, or engaged by players choosing to hunt them. This makes things very frustrating for newer players, and with the large influx of new players due to the release of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, we've decided to make a change.<br><br>Though we do not have a problem with players choosing to hunt guards, the newbie guards themselves, specifically the ones at the gates of cities and in the vicinity of newbie zones, need to remain alive under most circumstances. To that end, tomorrow morning we will be buffing up these newbie-protecting guards, making them immune to magic, and giving them some pretty good healing properties in order to make them less attractive to people hunting them.<br><br>In addition, though we will leave the guards inside cities as-is from the perspective of power, we've also found a problem with the respawn rate. Currently they are typically on six-minute timers, making them spawn much faster than an equivalent NPC would in a dungeon. We will be normalizing the respawn time of guards inside cities to bring them in line with dungeon NPCs. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>In the second post on this thread he said the following:<UL>While I agree with buffing up the newbie guards, I think it's foolish to increase the spawn time on the others. Why exasperate the problem of overcrowded dungeons by making the other areas less viable?<br><br><b><i>With the release of Kunark, the 4 recent servers, the fact that 3 of the Kunark Dungeons haven't really been explored to any great extent, and the fact that the Planes have thinned out a bit, we feel that the overcrowding problem in dungeons is well on its way to being corrected. We don't feel that this change will negatively impact that.</b></i><br><br>However, what about the guards you are SUPPOSED to kill, that are part of a quest?<br><br><b><i>Those guards are inside the city, and won't be subject to this change, beyond changing the respawn time. We'll also be upping the drop-percentage of the quest items in order to compensate for the less prolific guards.</b></i><br><br>Sounds fair. Better make sure this becomes a MOTD on all servers before you get flamed too much by those who don't get the message on the Boards. I'm just looking forward to seeing just how "unattractive" these new and improved guards become. <br><br><b><i>We'll put up a patch message tomorrow when the changes are made. An MOTD probably isn't necessary for this change.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the third post:<UL>We tend to raid cities and towns as part of our own quests and RP events for the guilds. Uber-izing the guards outside the main gates will most likely spell alot of death for even large numbers of high level players forming raids. The least you could do is make the names of the buffed guards red or something to denote them being the 'uber' guards. This also goes for our RP allies and enemy guilds such as House DeVir and the Skorchers.. guess raids are going to be out of the question from now on ;( (gee thanks)<br><br><b><i>I imagine that you'll still be able to melee the gate guards to death given a large enough party. We don't think that this will be happening so much that it nullifies our goals for these guards so we left it possible.<br><br>As for raids on cities, these should actually be even more possible now. Before, the spawn rates on guards inside the city was so fast that no one could really kill them all off. That would certainly be possible now.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the fourth:<UL>Oh Joy! A fix that only those under 5th level could love! My heart soars! <br><br><b><i>Well, being under level 5 is about the only experience that all EQ players have shared at one time or another, so I would hope you'd be more supportive.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the fifth:<UL>Yeah what about the dread outer guard Abashi? They get buffed up and you end up cutting off Lavastorm, Najena, SolA, and SolB to a lot of players.<br><br><b><i>The change will only apply to the newbie protecting guards such as those at the gate or in close proximity. The ones that wander all over won't be changed. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

EverQuest's targeting system was disucssed in a recent response Gordon Wrinn made on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the original post followed by Gordon's response:<UL>Why is it that the game isn't programmed to be smart enough to recognize that when you don't have a valid target for something like backstab, pick pocket, bandage, etc... that it doesn't have to grey out for the full duration? Isn't the duration representing how long it takes to bandage someone? Why does it take so long to recycle if you aren't actually BANDAGING anyone? This is a really simple thing to fix...<br><br><b><i>There's a few things like this in game and I imagine that we could do it if the time frees up, however I do wonder to what extent should we attempt to make the UI foolproof. <br><br>People in the past have asked for confirmation boxes for attacks (usually after they accidently attack an NPC when meaning to speak to them) as well as for something to stop them when they try to cast a buff or a heal on an NPC. There are a number of other things as well.<br><br>One of the factors of the game is learning how the UI works, and in what cases you can or cannot perform certain actions. When someone makes a mistake or gets something wrong, there is a consequence for doing that, such as for the SK who accidentally harm-touches himself, or the paladin that accidentally lays hands upon the dragon. Should these consequences for doing the wrong thing not exist?</i></b></UL>

From Andreas:<BLOCKQUOTE>We are two swedish students, at Umea university, who are writing a paper on<br>what makes MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games) popular<br>for our bachelor's degree. You can help us by answering our survey, at<br><a href="http://ctw.cs.umu.se/evals/externals/games/">http://ctw.cs.umu.se/evals/externals/games/</a> , and thus provide your opinion<br>on how a MMORPG should be constructed in the future. Since we have never<br>heard of any academic reports of this kind we are really interested in the<br>results. Hopefully the developers take notice and construct them after your<br>liking, since you are the ones buying their products ;-)<br><br>Thanx in advance,<br><br>Andreas Steding <br>Fredrik Ostrom</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks and good luck!
