Alan talked about character alignment (ie, good and evil) issues on the Roleplaying Server this this afternoon in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html">only update made</a> thus far to the Developer's Corner:<UL>Luzaphur wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: In a comment by Telius he asked if good vs evil could be coded for the new server. In the response it was stated that the good vs evil code would exclude neutrals and you would end up with invicible healers. Why not just make neutrals attackable by both good AND evil. That solves the good vs evil problem and balances out the advantage of neutrals being able to group with everyone. <br><br>Just my opinion, thanks ]</i></font><br><br>That would fix it. But I think that would also change the original intentions of Telius' idea. <br><br>In any case, we're firm on this not being a PvP environment, so we can hold off on speculating about how such and environment might, or might not, work. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I like the idea of it being hard to learn the languages of your foes, however I think an interesting role playing opertunity is being missed. Bards are traditionally seen as people who are good at maaking themselves understood so maybe a song that allows them to be understood by people who don't speak there language would be possible? Or allowing them to learn languages with more ease? Or something along those lines. This would help a rather rare class be more usefull on the roleplaying server. <br><br>--- Lulidine<br>--- Bard of Bristlebane ]</i></font><br><br>That's an idea we've talked about too. It all comes down to how we decide to cover the rather vague concept of making languages harder to learn (item #3, I think). <br><br>But allowing bards to have it a little easier to learn languages is something we're thinking about. It might just be that they get more languages at their trainers (which I think they do now already), or if we use some sort of maximum points per day or level or whatever that bards will get a slightly higher cap. <br><br>Odds are that the advantage, if there is one, will be slim, though. <br><br>Cantatus wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - Disable the option to show PC/NPC names on this server. It really doensn't make sense from RP terms that I would be omniscient enough to know people's names without asking (or targeting them). ]</i></font><br><br>You're right, it doesn't. But this is another one of those things that really has to be the way it is because without it the game becomes too inconvenient to play. Unfortunately it can often be hard to tell one person from another without those names. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - No common language? What happens to all the books written in common? Do they go to Human language? ]</i></font><br><br>Um&#8230; Er&#8230; <br><br>I dunno&#8230; <br><br>I'll have to look into that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - If druids in wolf form are reduced to barks, what are enchanters in elemental form supposed to do? :)]</i></font><br><br>Nothing&#8230; nothing at all. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - I'm still curious as to why only one character on this server? I'd much rather have the option of being able to roleplay many different type of characters and not be limited otherwise. And think of it, no twinking if you make a character with another alignment! ]</i></font><br><br>I feel exactly the same way. I make up new characters all the time. Unfortunately the overwhelming request from roleplayers was to reduce twinking. Making characters of different alignments wouldn't reduce twinking, since we have no plans of preventing trading between alignments (and, well, that's not how a lot of twinking is done anyway). <br><br>Also, there is a very strong argument for one character per server that has nothing at all to do with twinking. Identity. People with one character will identify with that character more. But more importantly, when playing on a one character server the actions of your only character will be linked to that one character. You build your reputation as you go and if you want to get rid of it, for whatever reason, you'll also have to get rid of the character. <br><br>The desire here is that people take more responsibility for their actions on a server that only allows one character. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - You know that little, tiny box people can write in for people to see when they are inspected? Any chance of enlarging this any? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, my thought was to remove it altogether (not that this is planned, we haven't talked about it at all yet). I have two reasons for this. The first is technical: It would allow people to bypass the language restrictions. <br><br>But the second is more compelling to me. <br><br>Tell people your story by playing with them. Weave your character's quirks and history into your life on Norrath. Don't just write out what your character is like into a little story and have people read it. Nobody that I know carries around a little sign explaining that his parents were mean to him and that's why he's so sullen all the time. <br><br>Play your character, don't turn him into a short story. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: My question is regarding the whole Good/Evil concept. This is probably going to fly in the face of everything that you are thinking, but I'm hoping that this has some merits. <br><br>In one of the posts it was noted that determination of alignment is, probably, going to be based on the "race, class, deity" combination. Here are my questions... <br><br>1. Is it fair to assume that all members of a race are Good or Neutral or Evil? ]</i></font><br><br>Well, that discussion came up in the office. I think the example was dark elven worshippers of Bristlebane. Some were of the opinion that all dark elves would be evil, regardless, and that such worshippers of Bristlebane worshipped a more spiteful, nasty, mean sort of prankster than the side of Bristlebane that nicer folks like Halflings worship. These would be 'evil' dark elves, despite their worship of a god that generally isn't considered evil. Others felt that such dark elves were worshipping Bristlebane as much because he is the god of thieves as because they were purposefully rebelling from the general Hatred of their people, and are therefore 'neutral' dark elves. <br><br>Both sides are, of course, right. Either could be the case. As the game designers and world creators, it might become necessary that we decide that one side is right and one is wrong. It we have to assign an alignment to dark elven rogues that worship Bristlebane, then we'll have to set that in stone. And that will be that. In much the same way that we've decided that Barbarians are tall and lizard people are called iksar and that some gnomes have green hair. <br><br>There are other races that could easily be given many alignments, humans being the most obvious. <br><br>So the answer would have to be, no, it's not fair to assume that all members of a given race are similarly aligned. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. Could not somebody who is "Evil," such as a Dark Elf, not change his views and decide that he's on the wrong side? ]</i></font><br><br>Of course he could. I'll leave out the whole argument about dark elves exterminating themselves when a whole generation turns 'good' on a whim&#8230; :)  But certainly individuals could make that choice. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. If a character works hard to increase his faction with an opposing race, such as a Dark Elf who kills hundreds of orcs so he can safely travel among the Wood Elves, isn't he considered to be "Good" by the Wood Elves, since he has fought for a goal they approve of, while his own people may hold him in disfavor for killing their allies? ]</i></font><br><br>Possibly. I'm more inclined to think that the Wood Elves see him as tolerable, not good. There's a very fine line there, but one that is important to me (I argued on the side that see dark elves that worship Bristlebane as evil, by the way). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. And is it reasonable for a character to have a change in "faith" and decide that his/her god is not the one to follow, that perhaps another religion is the "true" path? I imagine that the formerly worshipped god is going to be upset by this conversion, but it could happen. ]</i></font><br><br>Sure, that's reasonable. Again, though, I'm going to have to mention that there is a tendency in an open system for too many people to want to play the rebel. Allowing people to make their high elves into worshippers of Bertox might very likely cause a plague of such high elves to appear, changing the whole society to evil overnight. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Fantasy literature is filled with characters who go from Good to Evil or Evil to Good. This is done via actions taken, changes of heart, association with others. Is there any way this could be done in-game? ]</i></font><br><br>There are a few ways it could be done in game. But I'm not a fan of the idea, for reasons I think I've give a little too much time to in this thread. :)  And you also have to keep in mind that everything we come up with has to be programmed, and resource use is always going to be a consideration. The more complex, the more resources needed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Here are a few suggestions: <br><br>1. See if there is a way to use faction in the determination of alignment. (i.e. higher overall faction with the "Good" races than the "Evil" races has the character leaning toward "Good.") ]</i></font><br><br>Yes and no. I've seen a lot of ideas about how to do this. But factions are pretty much group related (you can gain and lose faction with one group of 'good' people, but that won't affect how all good people see you). We probably could do something like add up a bunch of faction numbers and weight them for degree of good or evil then total the numbers up and come up with some sort of degree of good and/or evil. But, well, would that really reflect on the character's alignment? <br><br>It might. But that's a lot of resources (process-wise and people-wise) for a system that would be designed pretty much for those that want to create the rebel dark elf or good ogre. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. Provide a way, perhaps via a quest, to begin worshipping another god. Maybe you have to get your faction up high enough to enter the primary temple to that god and then talk to the high priest or perform a ceremony at an alter or something. This would, of course, not be an option for a Cleric, Paladin, or Shadow Knight, as they derive their powers directly from their god. The change in which god is followed should also incur a rather serious negative faction hit with the followers and related factions of the original god, but no increase with the followers or related factions of the new god. This means that changing gods may change your alignment, but it won't make you more popular. You have to do that on your own. ]</i></font><br><br>This is probably also possible (remember, I'm not a programmer, and I don't play one on these boards). My thought would be that any such quest would have to be of 'epic' proportion. Changing your god would have to be a trial, or too many people would do it. <br><br>And, well, I can't picture allowing a dark elf to worship Tunare. Or an Iksar to worship Quellious&#8230; In the world of Norrath the gods given to you when you create the character really seem to me to be the only gods you should be able to switch to with a quest like this. I know there will be arguments against that, and I think we've talked about them before. <br><br>This is more of a philosophical issue for some. But the gameplay problems are pretty big too. Rangers that worship Innoruuk are not going to be able to find training. And, well, we're talking about a lot of quests here, even if we find some way to make it only one quest per god. These would be long and complicated quests (if not, I certainly wouldn't be happy with them&#8230;), and such quests take a lot of time to create. <br><br>Let us discuss this internally a bit and I'll get back to you. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. Keep part of the alignment based on race. There are going to be certain preconceptions that everyone has (all High Elves are Good, all Dark Elves are evil). This must have some basis in truth. Perhaps Dark Elves are predisposed towards Evil and High Elves toward Good. ]</i></font><br><br>Right. That makes sense. If alignment is based on something like race, class and deity, then race would always play a part. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. Keep class as part of the alignment calculation. Necromancers, no matter how noble, deal with dark arts and are not generally nice people. If you choose a certain discipline then you are implying a certain agreement with the principles of that class. ]</i></font><br><br>Also agreed. Keep in mind here, though, that right now we're just talking ideas. I don't really know how possible all this is yet. Our programmers are busy, and in-depth talks about this will be delayed a bit. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I guess this has gone on long enough. In summary, is there going to be a way to change alignment, even if it doesn't encompass what I've written above? I'm something of a romantic and the idea of an "Evil" person who sees the light, as well as the pure hearted person who falls from grace, seem very role playish to me. <br><br>Thank you for your time. <br><br>Steve Abbott<br>Jarrod of Bristlebane ]</i></font><br><br>The answer is, I don't know yet. <br><br>Personally, I don't think the idea of letting evil people see the light will work under the influence of real people playing the game. But we haven't ruled it out yet. First we'll have to decide how alignment will work, then we can talk about how to change it. :)<br><br>Ancalgon_of_Drinal wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just a thought / question about the RP server. (BTW I love the idea and am very much looking forward to it) <br><br>Since it will be set up along Good vs. Evil lines, are the factions going to be rearranged a little, so an Iksar (Evil team) can make use of the Dark Elf City (also Evil team)? <br><br>Thanks<br>Ancalagon Alag`Zi<br>Iksar Warrior ]</i></font><br><br>First, I really don't think it's a good idea to look at this server as any type of team server. While we intend to put restrictions on the interactions of goods and evils, looking at it as a team server puts the wrong sort of emphasis on the whole project. <br><br>No, we're not likely to change the basic factions on this server (or any other, for that matter). The fact that trolls don't trust iksar is, well, fact. Nothing about this server will change that. <br><br>drf wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: One request I would like to make would be that agnostic would be kept for a deity for those classes who have the option of agnostic. I roleplay my DE wizard as "good", only evil part about him is the fact that he is a dark elf. Worshipping Innoruuk would make this, from a roleplaying perspective silly. ]</i></font><br><br>I don't believe that we have any plans to remove agnostic as an option on this server. <br><br>_junior wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Funny that you should mention paladins and speaking teir'dal. The thing is, spoiler sites aside, there is at least one fairly low level paladin quest that requires being able to read Teir'Dal (falchion of Koada'Vie, I believe) in order to discover where the final mob spawns.<br>I'm all for making languages a little more difficult, but I also expect there will be some interesting repercussions on some of the cleverer quests out there. ]</i></font><br><br>No doubt. There will most likely be a lot of things that end up rather funky if we add in all these changes. With a game this complex that has been built up step by step over years, there will be plenty of things that end up sorta goofy after making some basic structure changes like those we're proposing. <br><br>We'll try to catch them as they come up. In this case, either I'm wrong about how paladin guild masters think about dark languages, or the quest will have to be changed&#8230; :)<br><br>Or perhaps only a very enterprising paladin will ever complete the quest. <br><br>Alan</UL>

I've got several comments from Lawrence Poe for you all today. <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Hey guys, sorry for the lack of responses lately. I've been hard at work on the Luclin spells, and haven't had much time to go through the Dev Corner emails. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Filan_tribunal wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: im wondering will PotG and Barrier of force ever stack i find it rather silly that a rune and a HP buff dont stack seeing that barrier is the effect of an epic weapon which would be far more powerfull then a normal casted spell. ]</i></font> <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I've corrected the issue in the spdat, these two effects should stack next patch. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Sootbeard wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Last night as I sat in Dreadlands meditating, a kind enchanter cast Clarity II and Gift of Brilliance on me, and I in return cast Spirit of the Wolf on him. When I got to my choice of hunting grounds, I attempted to cast Form of the Howler on myself and I just kept getting the "your spell did not take hold" message. I could not cast Form of the Howler while I had the spell Gift of Brilliance on. As soon as that spell wore off, I was able to cast Form of the Howler. Please look into the stacking issue on these spells. ]</i></font> <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Both of these spells share a mana regen component in the same effect slot.

I was so excited! <br><br>What could it be? The mighty Smite spell! For CLR and ENC, so I quickly bought one and tried to scribe it. Yes, I received the message, "Must be level 61 to scribe", hehe can't wait. <br><br>P.S. Some doubting cleric claimed it was a 14 lev spell, DOH nerfed already.

I was looking through spells and when I got to the merchant Rizyra F'Lok she had a spell on her that caught my attention when I noticed it was a level 61 Shadow Knight spell Augment Death, is somewhat distressing seeing level 61 spells when can never reach level 61.

If you have a buff on that shares components of a negative spell, the negative spell will overwrite the buff.

It seems that after wednesday's patch, it is possible to stack Form of the Howler, Form of the Hunter, and Spirit of Oak. From that point, you can cancel spirit of oak and keep all the benefits of Form of the Howler and Form of the Hunter without wolf illusion and the negative and positive faction (mostly negative) that come with it. Please either say this is ok or not intended. ]</i></font> <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>This was a bug that we introduced a couple of patches ago, it should be corrected now. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Any chance there will be solo teleports (gates) to points in Velious other than the Iceclad Ocean?

It's becoming so tedious to buff everyone on raids at 60. <br><br>Something like "Gift of the Phantasmist". A group spell that would wrap up Gift of Pure Thought, Enlightenment, and possibly Gift of Brilliance. <br><br>Although you can consider leaving out Gift of Brilliance if you insist on keeping the mana cost at 450. Talk about an broken spell. Four hundred and fifty mana! for a spell that adds 150 mana to your mana pool, and *BARELY* increases mana regen.

I tested it to be sure. I even tested it with a level 9 cleric attempting to cancel a Clinging Darkness from a level 6 necro.

This is annoying, to be sure. :)<br><br>My question is, is there any way you can put in a command to identify your character's bind point? Even if it just specifies the zone, it would be very helpful.]</i></font> <br><br>We recently (well, a few months ago&#8230; maybe last year&#8230; I don't remember&#8230;) added a command that will tell you your bind point. It's /charinfo. <br><br>I've used it a few times since it went in.

Math is below. <br><br>You are level 45 <br><br>1 level 60 kill = 100 + 15*2 = 130 points + 10 points for a greater insignia = 140 <br>1 level 20 kill = 100 + (-25)*2 = 50 points <br><br>So at level 45 you get more exp from taking out a 3 man group of level 20's than you do from one level 60. ]</i></font><br><br>That's true, he would get 20 more points. But no insignia and no cash. <br><br>I wonder if that group of 3 20 levels would be harder to kill? I'd be willing to bet that at least one of them gets away&#8230; <br><br>Keep in mind that we are not storing points, we're storing data that we use to calculate the points. So if we decide to change the point ratio we can do so at any time. <br><br>Gawain_the_Stout wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Has it been announced yet exactly what the rewards for turning in insignia might be? <br><br>And other than the prestige involved with being a top-rated PK'er for your team, what other advantage would there be to holding on to insignia? ]</i></font><br><br>We haven't announced the rewards. I'm not entirely sure that we will announce them. But we'll let you know when they go in. <br><br>Yes, boosting your point total will probably be the only reason to keep them. <br><br>Talez wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello, <br><br>Was just wondering where one can see the list of players and how many points they have. Ive looked on the www.everquest.com website but couldnt find anything relevant. Am i just overlooking something? ]</i></font><br><br>Nope, you haven't overlooked it. It's not up yet. I'll let you all know when it's ready. <br><br>Korgarl asked: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Questions:<br><br>1. Do you have to strike the killing blow to be awarded the insignia? ]</i></font><br><br>Yes. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. If 1 is yes how will the support classes benefit from this rule change (i.e. Shaman, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter)? ]</i></font><br><br>They won't. The support classes are just that, support classes. But don't kid yourself, I've been toasted several times on Sullon by clerics and shaman&#8230; <br><br>The game system pretty much only supports the current method. Player characters don't work the same as NPCs, and the killing blow is really the only way to accredit a kill against a PC. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. As the server matures this system will favor melee classes. Once this happens how will you overcome the stagnation due to specialization, when more people start to play melee classes? ]</i></font><br><br>I don't see that as a problem. If support classes become rare due to the urge to get the killing blow becoming prominent, then those that do play support classes will become the most desired players on the server. Remember, you still have to go out and kill NPCs to earn experience. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. I am interested in a PvP server that would incorporate role-play as an integral part. This was the closest you had until this change. What do you say to the people looking to role-play and have their day ruined by some corpse campers with nothing better to do than aquire points? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, on this server the fact that you can be a hostage to your corpse is part of the roleplaying. Your body is valuable, of course your enemies will consider guarding it. As a roleplayer, you shouldn't be thinking about the points. They are external to the game world and will never be shown in game. Ignore them and look at the actions of your enemy. They fit very well into the setting that is Sullon Zek. It's kind of a trick to play on those that don't roleplay. On this server, they are roleplaying when they jump you for being a goodie or for not following the ways of Bristlebane or whatever. The violence is inherent in the system. It's part of the game world. And therefore it is part of roleplaying in that world. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5. What if you made the insignias a part of a major deity specific "epic" quest for each class? Turn in the insignia for positive faction with you deity and negative faction with the deity of the slain player. Make this the only way you can get enough faction to get this "epic" item. At least then that player can claim he is a champion of his deity and has been rewared for his actions for the "cause". ]</i></font><br><br>Hmmm&#8230;. <br><br>:)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 6.

The Developer's Corner only saw one update from Alan today.  The subject of that one update is the RP server:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html"><b>Roleplaying Server</b></a><br>Telius wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Excuse me if this has already been asked...but i'm just wondering if you'll make it free to move characters unto this RP server from other servers.<br>Sounds like you're not too sure if this will be a success so i figured free transfers at least for a period of time or something could help growth of population.<br>Thanks ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, one of the few things that I am sure about for this server right now is that we will not be transferring character to it from other servers. Servers with special rulesets are usually harder, both for leveling and item acquisition. Moving characters to special servers like this from other servers isn't a fair thing to do. <br><br>Nope, if you want to play on this one, yer gonna have to start over. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have a few questions. I'll be brief and to the point. <br><br>1-GvE...Good vs. Evil. How tough would it be to implement code allowing good and evil characters to automatically be on hostile terms with one-another and be capable of fighting each other without submitting a duel? Dunno how to work neutrals into this, but thats why you guys are paid the big bucks. :)]</i></font><br><br>Probably possible. We could code PvP to be active between good and evil. But we can't do that and exclude neutrals. Then you have invulnerable healers in a PvP game, something we're not real fond of. And, well, we've pretty much decided that this will be a non-PvP server. When this one becomes a huge hit, then you can pester us for a version of a PvP roleplaying server&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2-Comprehend Languages...What about a new spell, with a very brief duration, that allows casters to understand all languages? This could help them to clear up confusion, and help enchanters and rogues pose as members of a different race, if they so choose. Maybe this could even help a character increase her understanding (skill level) of a language. ]</i></font><br><br>Interesting idea. Though I have no idea how a rogue would be casting this spell&#8230; <br><br>I would be against it improving language skills, since it actually would be contrary to learning the skill, you'd be magically bypassing the language altogether. But it's an interesting spell idea. I'll add it to the list of idears. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3-What about making formerly no drop quest items (items you would turn in to be rewarded another item) drop regardless of the level of the character vs. the mob? The prevent farming, could you implement code that would prevent any one character from performing the same quest more than once? ie...label the character with code which keeps them from doing the Totemic Breastplate quest twice. ]</i></font><br><br>This gets into very complicated territory. We really don't want to have to look over every quest in the game to evaluate them for such a restriction (some quests are perfectly ok to do more than once), and we're not looking to rewrite a whole bunch of game code here. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4-As for finding groups in large zones, thats what feet are for. I run almost everywhere. I can probably count the number of times I have bought a port on one hand (of course, as a shammy, I get great movement spells). What I am saying is, if you want a group in the Sarnak Fortress in Ill Omen, RUN to the Sarnak Fortress and look for a group there. Don't stand at 4p and just shout LFG! ]</i></font><br><br>I actually find that if you stand in front of someone and ask them if they need your help in their efforts against their foes, they are usually more receptive as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5-Add my vote to those who WANT certain items to be more rare. ]</i></font><br><br>ok. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 6-I'd like to see racial arms and armor nerfed a little. Northman Imbued Armor is really sad compared to, say, High Elven Mitrhil Plate Armor. And both pale in comparison to Ry'gorr. A character must be in his 30s to forge Northman Imbued, but by that time, he definitely won't want to wear it himself. And he'll be lucky if he can sell it for what it cost him to make it. People who work hard on their trade skills should be rewarded for it. Not forced to catch up with their friends whom have all moved on to tougher mobs and better loot (and thus, better armor than what you can make for yourself as a smith). ]</i></font><br><br>It sounds like your calling for an improvement to racial armor, not a nerf&#8230; And, while an interesting concern that I'll pass on, it's not something that directly relates to a roleplaying server ruleset. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 7-I like the thought of druids in wolf form having to bark. :)]</i></font><br><br>I remember this from playing first edition D&D. I had a character that could change into the three allowable druid shapes (though he weren't a druid&#8230; those were the good ol' days). Since he could only turn into each type (avian, mammal, and reptile) once a day, he was very reluctant to leave a form once he took it. But he couldn't communicate at all as a bird or a panther (except to some that he had some pre-set signals arranged with). I spent many an adventure not saying anything except to growl when people got to close&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Thanks for taking the time to get our input on this, and, as always, thanx for the hard work. We really do appreciate it. :)<br><br>~Agdi Spiritforge,<br>Prexus Server ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for the input.

The ppl out of the range only see the emote "Gysen mumbles something under her breath" That way my group can converse without group chat, but someone eavesdropping could as well...more roleplayish, if you will.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
A brand new load of <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000242.html">questions were answered</a> by Brad McQuaid in an update last night on the Developer's Corner.  Check it all out here:<UL>Brad, <br><br>I've stared at this post for 5 minutes trying to weed out my question. Here's hoping I picked a good one :)<br><br>During the development of a product like EverQuest, at what point is there no turning back? Technology speaking. How far into the design and implementation can you allow for inclusion of new technology prior to release? Like graphics(software) and servers(hardware). <br><br>Gina and Jacob Olson <br><br><b>Brad McQuaid: Well, the good news is that with MMOGs, there&#8217;s really never a time when you can&#8217;t include new technology. The client software is always patchable, data on the server side can be updated, and even server hardware can be replaced. And we&#8217;ve done all three with EverQuest in the last couple of years. Not only have we updated the client&#8217;s engine, we&#8217;ve also started using newer versions of Direct X. The server-side data is updated almost every patch with new content. And the server-side hardware has been upgraded many times &#8211; we&#8217;ve added more memory, faster CPUs, and faster hard drives as technology has advanced. </b><br><br>------ <br><br>Hi Brad, <br><br>I was a beta player and am still a big fan of the game (EQ) after all this time. One of the things you did when you created the game was to say that all the servers would be maintained by Sony/Verant rather than like what ID had been doing with QUAKE, where anyone could set up a Quake server. There would be no private "World Servers" in EQ. <br><br>I guess my question is: Is this the model you are following for all future games currently planned? Will you be setting up a Neverwinter Nights style game eventually where players generate the content for one another? <br><br>Guess we players are all just frustrated Game designers at heart. <br><br>-Archanalia <br><br><b>Personally I think there&#8217;s a big future for both traditional MMOGs as well as &#8216;Neverwinter Nights&#8217; style games. They&#8217;re both very different, afterall. <br><br>We&#8217;ve no plans on making EverQuest such that the public could maintain servers for two reasons: <br><br>1. It&#8217;s not the economic model we&#8217;ve designed both the game and its support structure for. <br><br>2. One EQ world takes something like 20+ high-end dual processor machines with tons of memory to run, not to mention gobs of bandwidth. So we simply don&#8217;t think it would be very practical for people outside of our business to run. <br><br>That said, while EQ, Star Wars: Galaxies, Planetside, and Sovereign are all being designed as premium subscription based MMOGs, I wouldn&#8217;t rule out an SOE/Verant &#8216;Neverwinter Nights&#8217; style game one day. I can&#8217;t wait to play the game myself, as well as to discover the potential of user-generated content. </b><br><br>------ <br><br>Brad, <br><br>Ok, so Verant likes grouping... But, they apparently don't like multi-group raids... Why isn't there a 'raid channel (or channels)' for each zone? <br><br>A lot of people aren't in guilds, and a lot of guilds get allies to raid - why not fix this 'design flaw' so you can accommodate us? <br><br>(granted, 'design flaw' is not the most appropriate word, but it fits my feelings on this...) <br><br>Thanks :)<br><br>Jason Wallace <br><br><b>You&#8217;re right: we need to better accommodate multi-group raids. We definitely have lots of content in the game designed for raids, and we love the fact that the game can handle massive battles. But it wasn&#8217;t always that way, which can help explain why we don&#8217;t currently have any features to support groups with more than six members. <br><br>Way back when we were designing the game we were very worried about how many players we&#8217;d be able to display on the screen at once. This was back when we were developing a software render and using Pentium 133s to develop the client. In the text MUDs we&#8217;d played, groups could be huge (sometimes there&#8217;d be between twenty and thirty people all attacking a dragon). But we were worried about framerate, and what might happen if a bunch of players appeared on the screen at once. <br><br>Single player games didn&#8217;t really have such concerns because their developers could always control how many players and NPCs could appear on the screen at once &#8211; they could budget for a maximum. But we couldn&#8217;t stop an army of players from assembling (nor did we really want to). <br><br>So we designed the game for a maximum group size of six, made some character optimizations (for example, dynamic level of detail on character models), and hoped for the best. <br><br>Turns out, over time, technology has advanced such that we can display many more players than ever we&#8217;d hoped. Not only that, bandwidth optimizations have been made as well. So we&#8217;ve been putting in raid content for some time, but I agree with you &#8211; it&#8217;s time to put in additional support and features for larger group communications, experience splitting, etc. <br><br>I don&#8217;t have a time frame for you, but I hope it will happen by Luclin or soon after. </b><br><br>--------- <br><br>Brad, <br><br>Cool idea by the way (referring to Ask Brad). <br><br>My question is about the effect "pulling" has had on the game and if it's not what you originally had in mind when the game play was being designed. Would/will you design your next games to be Pull proof? <br><br>I have read on the boards from time to time, that Verant was disappointed when certain situations were being single pulled because your intent was for those to be multi mob encounters. I play a Monk and in my 59.4 levels I have pulled A LOT of mobs. I have abilities that make it easy in most cases to pull a single back for processing. <br><br>I have follow up questions that ride on your answer being that pulling is not what you originally intended, especially FD splitting. What was your intent was with FD if it wasn&#8217;t pulling? Will you include similar ability in future ventures? <br><br>Observation from me as a player: It doesn&#8217;t work in a fight if other players are still hitting said mob, so, it only seems to be useful for pulling and CR. <br><br>Thank you for reading along, <br><br>Paul Carter <br><br><b>Well, yes and no. The original intent of the game certainly did not include &#8216;pulling&#8217;. We rarely pulled when we were playing text MUDs; rather, we&#8217;d fight room to room, adventuring through a dungeon or towards a specific goal. <br><br>But, obviously, 3D graphical MUDs like EverQuest aren&#8217;t room based (in other words, there&#8217;s no clear delineation between rooms like most text MUDs have). One of the several results of this evolution from text to graphics was &#8216;pulling&#8217;. <br><br>From a design standpoint, pulling is a bit frustrating because it&#8217;s much harder to set up an encounter with multiple NPCs that you desire to fight the player (or group of players) all at once. Pulling allows one to separate groups of NPCs, singling them out, making them easier to kill. <br><br>All that said, we did realize these ramifications early in beta and started adapting the game accordingly. Spells and other strategies were put into the game to support and actually help players pull, and the game designers started laying out dungeons and other adventure areas accordingly. <br><br>In the future, I&#8217;d love to experiment further and try to recapture more of the multi-NPC battles we experienced in text MUDs. But EverQuest is and will remain a game where &#8216;pulling&#8217; is a valid and recognized tactic. <br><br>Oh, and Feign Death was originally designed to be merely a feature that would save a Monk should a battle go rather badly. It was an ability we gave that class to make up for their lower Armor Class. </b><br><br>------- <br><br>You are discussing a lot of ideas with the player base that undoubtedly your competition is reading also. What are your thoughts on this? Giving the competition a bit of a glimpse to the internal thinking at SOE/Verant and potentially giving them ideas. Or worse yet seeing them make an idea you discarded work very well. <br><br>Tanstaafl Fyreweaver [Horizons]<br>Innoruuk <br><br><b>When it comes to competition and ideas, there are two extremes, and I like to think we&#8217;re somewhere in the middle. One extreme is to carefully hide all ideas and technology until the very last minute, lest some other company use an idea in their product or be influenced in some positive way. The other extreme is to talk about everything and have no secrets. <br><br>I think we&#8217;re early enough in the evolution of MMOGs that it helps all those involved to share ideas to some extent. To that end, we&#8217;re a pretty open and friendly group of developers. Most people involved in making these games know each other, hang out with each other at GDCs and E3s, participate in email lists and message boards, sharing ideas and dreams. <br><br>That said, you won&#8217;t read some ideas of ours in detail in this column or elsewhere. We do have some pretty nifty plans and schemes we think should remain private until such time they can be implemented. <br><br>It&#8217;s really all about balance. Will our competition glean something from my posts here that will help them? Well, that&#8217;s very flattering, and if they do, so be it. I know we look at their products and posts, trying to learn what to do and what not to do. It&#8217;s only fair that they do the same. </b><br>----------- <br><br>Brad, <br><br>Are there any plans to have books written that take place in the world of Norrath, perhaps telling the exploits of Firona Vie, Lanys T'vyl or other noteworth folk? Maybe giving more detail about things that have happened, like Bloody Kithicor? I think it would be great, and a nice way to carry a little EverQuest with us when we can't be near our PC. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Kendall <br><br><b>We&#8217;d love to have novels written about Norrath and its inhabitants. I can&#8217;t say much more right now, but we ARE currently talking to publishers and writers. </b><br><br>---------- <br><br>Brad who the heck are you any way? <br><br>R. Thomas <br><br><b>I&#8217;m Brad McQuaid, currently the Vice President of Premium Games for Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive. <br><br>John Smedley hired Steve Clover and me in March, 1996 to work on a massively multiplayer RPG. Initially I was the lead programmer, but after a few months became EverQuest&#8217;s Producer (the Producer being the person who manages and leads the development team, which typically consists of programmers, artists, and designers). <br><br>Steve and I were also the game&#8217;s original designers, and architects of the original Design Document. We came up with the core design (modeled heavily on MUD principles) and a rough outline of Norrath. Bill Trost later came on board and became the official lead designer, filling in most of Norrath&#8217;s detail and background history, and also replacing our initial alignment system with a much more intricate faction system. <br><br>I also did a lot of the PR for EverQuest early on, because 989 was focused more on Playstation titles at the time. <br><br>After Verant Interactive spun off of 989 Studios, John Smedley became president of that company and I became Vice President. We took on more projects and I moved from a direct management role into more of an Executive Producer (Jeff Butler replaced me as EverQuest&#8217;s Producer and he took over the Live/Expansions teams). <br><br>And finally, when Sony Online Entertainment bought Verant Interactive, I became one of several Vice Presidents, but remained managing our Premium subscription based games. Currently I&#8217;m the Executive Producer on EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin, as well as some other unannounced titles. I also oversee, albeit at a higher level, the Star Wars: Galaxies project, with Rich Vogel, Director of Development, running the project. I&#8217;ve also been involved in the design process behind Planetside and Sovereign. </b><br><br>--------- <br><br>Brad,<br>I was wondering about the capacity that each server has for zones. When EQ started, the only zones were from the 'old world'. Then the Kunark zones were added, then Velious and soon Luclin. What is the limit for zones? Is there one? Are the servers actually single box solutions, or is each 'server' a number of machines, making the number of zones almost unlimited? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Robert <br><br><b>The sever architecture behind EverQuest is very modular, with zones running on multiple machines. So as we expand the world (which really means simply adding more zones), we also add more &#8216;zone servers.&#8217; Kunark and Velious added several machines per world, as will Luclin. As for a limit, I&#8217;m sure there is one, because there are still functions that need to be centralized. But, luckily for us, technology has continued to advance such that we&#8217;ve always been able to upgrade both our central and zone computer hardware with faster and faster components. </b><br><br>------------ <br><br>Brad,<br>I'm really curious about how all the EQ servers are housed, i mean, there's over 30 servers and they gotta be huge, do you all house them in a big building? Does everyone on the EQ team work there as well? or are you all really covert and hanging out in mom's garage powering these beasts?<br><br>(name excluded please) <br><br><b>This question, the previous one, and many others were about EverQuest servers and topology. Scott McDaniel (our VP of Marketing) and Adam Joffe (our Director of Operations) recently did an interview where they discuss our servers at <a href="http://www.hostingtech.com/eb/01_06_everquest.html">http://www.hostingtech.com/eb/01_06_everquest.html</a> -- check it out and let us know what you think. </b><br><br>----------- <br><br>Greetings !<br><br><br>My question is in regards to the Luclin expansion. As an answer to a previous question you stated that the zones in the old world zones would not be enhanced with the new Luclin engine. My question is about the characters, will those all have the new look once the expansion is enabled? Will we have to remake our characters to get the new look?<br><br><br>Thank you for your time<br><br><br>Miscai<br>Shadow Guard<br>Sullon Zek <br><br><b>Don&#8217;t worry &#8211; no need to remake any characters (that is, unless you decide to start a new Kerran character). The new character graphics will show up for all characters if you upgrade to the Expansion and turn those graphics on (even if you do upgrade, you&#8217;ll have the option to turn them off if you still prefer the older graphics). And you&#8217;ll see the new characters on Luclin as well as on the Old World. </b><br><br>---------- <br><br>What are your thoughts on having one character per account on a server? I personally think it shot down two birds with one stone. It made twinking much harder and also made people think twice about soiling their reputations. Will this be considered in future EQ servers and future games, and is it Boxers or Briefs for you? <br><br>Surefoot Twelvetoes<br>Sterling Order of Knights<br>Fennin Ro <br><br><b>I definitely think fewer characters per server is a good thing. To understand why there are eight character slots per server, we&#8217;ll have to take another walk down memory lane: :)<br><br>Back when we were designing the game, we had NO clue if it would turn out to be popular or not. We certainly had no idea we&#8217;d end up with 30+ servers. In fact, we were thinking we&#8217;d have five or six at most. And because we wanted to have a game with 12 races and 14 classes, we also wanted to make sure players had the opportunity to explore and enjoy most of those race/class combos, should they so choose. <br><br>Obviously, with 20/20 hindsight and 30+ servers, eight character slots per world isn&#8217;t necessary. And that is why you see the feature restricted on Sullon Zek and the future RP server. We will also consider fewer character slots with our future games. <br><br>ps. Briefs :)</b><br><br>--------- <br><br>Just a couple of questions about Luclin and stuff. <br><br>I know that current characters will have the option to "remodel" their character in the expansion, such as changing faces, etc. <br><br>1. Will you be able to colour hair? Just curious. <br><br><b>Don&#8217;t think so, no. </b><br><br>2. Will current characters be able to opt *not* to turn into a new model? <br><br><b>You&#8217;ll be able to toggle between showing all player characters using the new models or the old (but probably not a combination thereof). </b><br><br>3. Will people who do not upgrade to Luclin (I don&#8217;t imagine there will be many. :)) be able to see the new models? (They'll obviously have to have higher system specs if they will be able to) <br><br><b>No, they&#8217;ll need to buy Luclin in order to see the new models. </b><br><br>4. Will my paladin ever be able to wear a plate helm without it looking like a bucket on his head? :)<br><br><b>We&#8217;ll have to wait and see :)</b><br><br>5. Do you think that SOE is trying to gain a monopoly on the MMOG market? They've already got Infantry, EQ, SW:Galaxies, and a few others I cant remember... <br><br><b>I certainly wouldn&#8217;t call us a monopoly, because we currently have some formidable competitors and there are also lots of future MMOGs in development. That said, with both the experience gained and the pool of talent we&#8217;ve put together, I definitely think SOE/Verant is poised to be this market&#8217;s leader for quite some time to come. </b><br><br>6. Do you and the GMs have LAN parties on your what must be an unimaginably sweet office setup? :)<br><br><b>Heh, not often enough :)</b><br><br>I think thats all. :)<br><br>Delphi <br><br>--------- <br><br>Hi Brad, <br><br>I was recently reading through your posts and stumbled on your comments regarding DirectX and OpenGL. <br><br>I beg to differ on one point. There is an advantage to using OpenGL, and that is EQ could more easily be ported to Linux or MacOS. I for one, would love to see a MacOS port. I have many friends who are unable to play EQ, because they are Mac diehards and refuse to pay Mr. Gates. <br><br>While I realize it is probably too late for EQ, are there plans to port future Verant MMORPG titles (SWG -- *hint* *hint*) to other platforms? <br><br>- Samoy Spiritstorm<br>51 Enchanter, Povar <br><br><b>That&#8217;s a very valid point &#8211; it&#8217;s definitely easier to port to other platforms using OpenGL. Unfortunately, however, EverQuest is very Win32-centric, and not only because we chose to use Direct X, so I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be seeing it ported any time soon. <br><br>Our second generation engines, however, are being designed from the ground up to be much more portable. </b><br><br>---------- <br><br>Short and simple question: Why didn't casters get disciplines, or some equivalent ability? <br><br>Gihmle Gearbungler <br><br><b>Short and simple answer: We came up with disciplines so we could enhance the melee classes because it didn&#8217;t make sense to give them spells. In other words, casters get new spells instead. </b><br><br>---------- <br><br>I was wondering... I noticed every Expansion of EQ comes with a map with the new continent added (i.e. Kunark, Velious). Well this may seem a silly question, but how do you plan on adding the moon to this map? Isn&#8217;t the moon a Three Dimensional land? Will there be a nice cardboard un-foldable cut out? <br><br>-jonglo <br><br><b>Luclin will indeed come with a new map, and hopefully in a more unique and three-dimensional format. </b><br><br>------ <br><br>Why are some, smaller cities divided into zones, like Kaladim and Felwithe? It seems like they could've easily been one zone, especially when compared to other one-zone places. <br><br>- Kronx-Zeb <br><br><b>Many of the earlier zones were so large that the game designers had to split them up because they were too large to work on all in one piece. Zones like those you mentioned, as well as Solusek&#8217;s Eye, Qeynos, and many others began as one zone but were later split into two (or even three with Neriak) because the files grew so large it brought their systems to a crawl. More recently, with Kunark and Velious, we were able to make large, single zones, because PCs are so much faster now (speedier CPUs, more RAM, and better 3D cards). </b><br><br>-------- <br><br>Brad - <br><br>I remember reading about a possible EQ comic book and some fantasy novels coming out. Is this being developed? <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Nylia Femina <br><br><b>Funny you should ask that, because Jeff Butler and I are having lunch tomorrow with Jim Lee to check on the comic's process. Jim is a very busy guy, but we do plan on getting this comic done this year (I hope). And for those of you familiar with Jim Lee&#8217;s art, well, you know the comic will certainly be worth the wait. </b><br><br>------- <br><br><b>Thanks for all your emails! Keep 'em coming :)<br><br>-Brad </b></UL>

It's been a quiet couple of days on the Developer's Corner.  Today's only highlight was <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html">this post made by Alan</a> speaking on the subject of the RP server:<UL>LaBeau wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Neutral person clicks on Troll SK, -Invite-<br>Neutral person clicks on Human Pali -Invite-<br><br>Both then click on -follow-<br><br>May haps make it so Neutral people can't -Invite- people, because, who would 'follow' a neutral person? (Gahndi doesn't count) You could 'invite' a neutral person to 'come over to the dark side Luke', and he would have to become a 'follower of the dark side' I would imagine he would have to take a faction hit for following one or the other. Group with evil to much, and you are no longer neutral, but evil. ]</i></font><br><br>Not a problem. No matter how hard you try, those two clicks can't happen at the same time. One has to be processed before the other. So one of those folks is going to be rejected from the group. <br><br>Temporary wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I really think that any "RP sever" will have to be PVP in order to BE RP. I mean, what exactly is a dark elf and high elf suppose to do when they bump into each other? Scowl at and insult each other in different languages and then move on? ]</i></font><br><br>They should duel each other, if their conflict comes to blows. <br><br>This server is going to be Player vs Environment (PvE) for the simple reason that it seems the most popular choice. A lot of people prefer not to be involved in PvP at all. <br><br>While I agree that a true roleplaying server would have to involve PvP, there are too many people that would use their ability to kill other characters for the express purpose of making people unhappy. For this server, we're not allowing that. <br><br>This isn't really one of the negotiable points at this time. The basis for this server is a roleplaying oriented non-PvP server. From there we build the rules. <br><br>Who knows what we'll do after this, but for now, this one's non-PvP. <br><br>CidHighwind wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, just do us one favor and admit that you realize that we the paying customers do not want items to be more rare. Just because you think rarer items would be good does not mean we do, I ask that you admit you would be doing it against our desires. ]</i></font><br><br>Sorry, can't do that. <br><br>It's simply true, there are a lot of people that want items to be more rare in the game. <br><br>On this server I wouldn't be surprised to find that some of the higher end items remain more rare than they are on other servers because some tasks are harder to do when you can't just group any characters with any other characters. You might not see necromancers helping paladins to obtain their flaming swords. You may not see too many dark elves helping high elf magicians kill dark elven magicians in Najena so that the high elf can get a focus. <br><br>While there are certainly people that will not like this restriction, there are many that will. Just as Sullon Zek does not appeal to folks that do not like PvP, the roleplaying server will not appeal to people that prefer convenience over roleplaying. And that's just fine. These special rules servers can't appeal to a broad group. In fact, the point is to make a rule set that appeals to a rather narrow group. As long as that group is large enough to fill at least one server, we're good to go. <br><br>LaranosTZ wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have given it some thought regarding the green/loot code options you have proposed for the new role playing server, and I have come to the conclusion that it is a -bad- idea. I will use the most extreme example for my example, that of the mage epic quest. <br><br>The mage epic quest contains a grand total of 9 items which drop off of blue or better mobs at level 50. This is in contrast to the 15 items which are needed off of green mobs, often times in isolated areas, which comprise the majority of the time invested into this quest. Many of the other epic quests are the same way...several difficult battles which result in primary items, but massive amounts of items which simply must be camped by a character in areas quite green to them. With this new loot system, you are essentially requiring a character to start their epic quest in their thirties, or even in some cases, their twenties. Considering the length of time I have camped one of the green items in my quest, and also considering that almost all the green items are in the same level range, it is also possible that even if you -started- camping epic items when they were blue to you, or even yellow/red...it is quite likely that by the time you had almost attained them all, some of the creatures would have become green, thus negating all your previous efforts, unless you de-level to meet that. <br><br>I admit, this is an extreme example, but it is analgous to what many players do in the everquest environment. They are unable to complete quests until they are able to tackle quest components in green environments. By instituting warrens loot code, those efforts would be impossible, and thus, many quests would become unreachable for a large portion of the player base, unless the quests were revised a very large amount. ]</i></font><br><br>Hmmm&#8230; <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>essentially requiring a character to start their epic quest in their thirties, or even in some cases, their twenties. <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>And this is a bad thing? <br><br>I don't think so. In fact, most of those epic quests were designed to be worked on as you go. The idea is that they are the culmination of your character's career, not the efforts of a lot of work at the end of your career. Doing them as you go is the idea. <br><br>The fact that many people don't tackle these things until the NPCs involved are very green to them&#8230; well that's kind of the issue being addressed with the anti-bottom feeding code. Tackle things when they are challenging, not when they are simply a matter of one-shotting some poor Gnoll. <br><br>The valid concern is, well, what if I didn't look up the spoilers and learn the steps that I needed and missed one. With the anti-bottom feeding code I can't go back and make up the missed part. <br><br>That's why Brad suggested removing all no-drop code on this server. If you missed it then you can pay a bunch of adventurers to go get the item for you. Isn't that the essence of your standard roleplaying adventure? Some powerful guy is too busy to go do something himself, so he tosses some coin at adventurers who go tackle something tough (for them) and come back wondering why they risk their lives for mere coins? <br><br>Nektik wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have a quick question regarding languages on the planned 'rp' server. <br><br>Will NPCs speak their racial langauges?<br>In other words, will we need to learn Human to do a quest out of Freeport? ]</i></font><br><br>Right now I just don't know. I'd like to see it work that way. But there might just be too many issues with doing that. I'll let you know what comes up in that regard. <br><br>Elkanah wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I was wondering what language a druid in wolf-form would speak?

A couple of updates were made by Alan today on the Developer's Corner.  Here's the skinny:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html"><b>Roleplay Server</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Your mention of enchanters/bards/rogues brings up an interesting point... <br><br>If I'm a High Elf Enchanter and I cast Illusion: Troll, can I then group with members of Evil races? If so, wouldn't it be rather easy for me to learn their languages? By "easy" I mean that I wouldn't have to find a Neutral person who had learned their languages. I could just join the Evil group and my language skills would improve steadily until I could understand what was being said. <br><br>Then again: I imagine that until you're fairly good at their language, it would be difficult (if not impossible) to find an Evil group who would take you as a member. I know I'd be pretty frustrated if someone joined up who could not communicate with anyone else in the group. <br><br>AND, imagine the surprise of the poor Troll who joins an "Evil" group, only to find out that it's a bunch of Good bards/rogues/enchanters! And him not even able to eat them all, due to it not being a PvP server. 8( <br><br>Just some stuff to think about... <br><br>Nocturne Somnus -Socratic Method- ]</i></font><br><br>While that sounds like and intriguing idea, I don't think it can be done. <br><br>The ability to group with other is going to have to be based on some sort of information, probably an alignment, that is calculated from existing information (race, class, deity). It's unlikely that this information will be stored on the character. So there won't be a way to change it by a spell. <br><br>And it also leads to all sorts of problems. For example, what happens when your illusion goes down? <br><br>While I like the idea conceptually, I don't think it's going to be practical. <br><br>Slugworth wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: GROUP TO PORT? DARK ELF WIZARD? <br><br>I am really new to Everquest and I am having a BLAST! The discussion of the Roleplaying server excites me, but I have a quick question. Again I am new to this, so take it with a grain of salt. <br><br>Dont you have to be grouped with a Wizard or Druid to be able to teleport or evacuate? If that is true and you DO have to be grouped, I can see a problem. <br><br>As far as I know non of the evil races can be Druids, therefore the only race/class combination able to teleport any evil group would be a Dark Elf Wizard. That could turn into a bit of a problem. <br><br>Thanks. ]</i></font><br><br>You're correct. An 'evil' character might not be able to obtain the services of a druid. <br><br>But they might. If we allow druids to be neutral, and if we allow evils and neutrals to group, then there won't be a problem. <br><br>But I really doubt that such a thing will be a big consideration on this server. If a necromancer can't rely on a nature worshipper to do favors for him, that's fine in a roleplaying environment. The necromancer has alternatives, not the least of which are evil wizards. <br><br>On this server we may very well sacrifice some 'convenience' things in favor of roleplaying things. That's really the whole point. But we may also make exceptions (like summon corpse &#8211; this spell helps players solve stuck corpse issues), but convenience might not take priority over setting on this server. <br><br>Sengan wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just a couple of quick comments on a few things Absor responded to: <br><br>Having a /say component to group chat would be a very bad idea. First, things that are said to the group are often private and having others hear could reveal things you didnt wish them to hear (strategies for example), or things that are fine with your group but not necessarily fine with those who might listen in (swearing for example). In addition, if the group was not one who's language you spoke the /say component would simply be extremely, make that EXTREMELY, annoying spam. Even if you DID speak their language but weren't interested in what they had to say, it would be extremely annoying spam. <br><br>On the idea that the server will create insular groups by race, I would tend to agree. Where I disagree though is that these groups would ever, even at high levels become less insular. The people you start playing with are generally the people you tend to stay playing with. By having the races be insular for the low to even mid levels, you increase the likelihood that they will remain that way for the entire time they play the game. I dont think there is any sort of guarantee that things wont remain insular. This will create some problems if it is the case. <br><br>Somewhere along the line Absor responded (sorry didnt copy the exact point) that the "real fix is that players get along". Sounds great, but you are putting up a whole lot of barriers to that which you hope people will get around. How do you get along with someone you cant talk to?? Answer is you dont. As far as you are concerned they are playing a different game in another universe. You cant talk to them, they cant tell you what they want, you cant tell them what you want, you cant agree to share a spawn, you can only fight over it. You cant enforce any sort of play nice (not sure if you intended to anyway though on a PvE sever I would guess you did). Even if someone can speak the other groups language they dont have to admit they can. I can just see the fight over Ragefire as there are 6 groups all speaking different languages and none willing to in any way do anything other than fight for the spawn and then claim kill stealing if the didnt get it.<br>The barriers you will create with the programming pretty much make "the real fix is players that players get along" a very very iffy thing. ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, the say component to group say could be a huge pain in the behind. The spam might be enough of a reason to not do it. <br><br>But if you're talking bad about someone, or strategizing against them, then you probably should move out of their hearing range. <br><br>If people stick to their own race for their entire lives on this server, that would be great! If they choose to branch out in order to accomplish things that they can't accomplish with their own people, that's fine too. If something that they want to do is out of reach, then the troll band can link up with some inkies to get it done. That's all a very good thing on a roleplaying server. <br><br>Players know what's going on. They know when they are kill stealing, they know when someone wants to share a spawn.

I have an update from Hobart for you all. <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I think there has been a little confusion about what I meant when I said "looting rights". <br><br>Here is a recap of the paragraph that is causing confusion: <br><br><i>"We will be also changing the way PvP experience loss works on Sullon. The current problem is that a high level player can repeatedly kill lower level players without risk. The higher level player can continue to harass these lower level players without risk of experience or coin loss for any amount of time. While one could use the same argument that the lower level players are also losing nothing, we feel there should be some innate risk with a higher level player bottom feeding these lower level players. With this change, it will make higher level players think twice before attacking low level players. This will also give groups of lower level players an incentive to group up and take on higher level adversaries. So we intend to change the rules so that any character killed by a lower level character will lose experience. Along with the experience loss, the killing person will be given looting rights also." </I><br><br>Here is some clarification: <br><br>Many people have expressed the concern of twinking kills to lower level players. They would do this by taking a higher level character and beating down an opponent. Then letting a much lower level character get the final blow. Thus, the looting rights. While this can certainly happen, it is still the case where only coin can be looted. And, in this special case of experience loss being caused outside the + or - 5 level limit, a deity insignia would NOT be generated. The insignia's will remain only for those kills within a + or - 5 level limit. <br><br>We could take this even another step back and say there are NO looting rights and just experience is lost. I am even open to more suggestions on how we keep high level players from (I can't think of another word besides grieving?) lower level players. <br><br>While I have the time, I wanted to address some more thoughts on this. <br><br>Bards and boats - We will definitely remove songs at first. And yes, this will most likely happen across all servers. If anyone can think of any problems this would cause, please let us know. <br><br>Evil Vs Evil? - This is more of a probe to see what players think about the idea. That's why we threw it out to you to chew on. But I can assure you that it hasn't been ruled out 100%. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "Conclusion: I really think Sullon Zek is a GREAT idea, but I see these certain aspects of the game as unbalancing, easily manipulated to favor certain people (not exploits mind you, just poor PvP planning for the world as a whole). <br><br>As the server is now, it is far more discouraging than fun, especially for light races playing evil chars and dark races playing good/neutral classes. They are just too thinly spread in their starting zones/areas/cities and the lack of binders in the surrounding areas and cities makes it even more discouraging. Upon hitting level 6 they are just bait and the lack of numbers means there is no way in which they can amass a small army for vengeance as they are far too outnumbered." ]</i></font><br><br>The poster did not give a name for the above text. <br><br>One thing to remember. EverQuest was not made with PvP in mind. So when servers like the Zek's come out, it is very hard to balance everything in regards to PvP. We don't have the resources to go through all the old world content and rebalance it for PvP. With Sullon, we have made some exceptions and have begun implementing quests that only appear on this server. We also did some changes with the race class combinations found on this server to help attempt to balance things. <br><br>As for the server being more discouraging then fun, everyone has a different thought on the "FUN" aspect of the server. Hopefully over time, and time permitting, we will be able to add more fun aspects to the server. <br><br>PvP Immunity update: <br><br>The changes made for the PvP Immunity for players under 6 is in its QA phase. Here are the details on what has been done. <br><br>These zones will continue to protect players below level 6 from PvP combat. <br><br>Steamfont, Nektulos, Qeynos Hills, Everfrost, Tox, Misty Thicket, East Commons, Innothule Swamp, Feerrott, Butcher, Field of Bone, Swamp of No Hope, Warsliks Wood, Lake of Ill Omen and all City Zones (the zones where faction hits will take place). <br><br>When entering another zone, it will indicate that you are no longer immune from PvP. <br><br>/Con: <br><br>You may also notice that we slipped in new con messages for the Neutral Alliance. They can now tell whether their opponent is evil or good aligned. This should allow for neutral alliance to make alliances with another alliances more easily. <br><br>Hobart Wolfkin<br>Barbarian Warrior<br>The Tribunal <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Thanks for the update, Hobart. </UL>

The RP server and today's patch are the topics that the latest edition of the Absor Infobits explores:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000240.html"><b>Patch Talk</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: OH NO! that "run funny" thing with the animations getting stuck was soooo funny, why bother fixing stuff like this when it adds a fun new twist to the game? Does this unbalance or put anyone at risk? just curious =) <br><br>/cheer<br>-az ]</i></font><br><br>It was kinda funny. I saw several folks that looked like they had a nasty kink in their necks running about in Norrath recently. <br><br>But it's a bug, a goofy one, but a bug. We like to fix bugs. <br><br>Lenadayna_Stardew wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: While this patch was a much better patch then the last one overall, I'm quite offended you felt the profits on baking needed to be nerfed. Truthuflly, it's one of the few tradeskills that actually is a tradeskill (i.e., you can make a profit off of it. You can't do that with anything other than fishing), but you could make more money doing monster killing anyway. (i.e., baking is about 20 pp an hour... few players are going to make a fortune off of it.) <br><br>People also used baking to fund *other* trade skills because they don't sell back to vendors for a profit and should, especially items that are of low value to players, and even with the new statistic boosts on certain items, they are still of low value to players. <br><br>Please put this back the way it was, there was no reason for this change. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, actually, there are plenty of trade skills that folks make a profit from. There just aren't any that people make a profit from by selling stuff to vendors. We have no intention to create trade skills that reward people for the number of mouse clicks they can make every hour. The intent is to create trade skills that are profitable when items are sold to other players, allowing (forcing) them to deal with other people to make their money. <br><br>And your 20pp per hour estimate is, well, shamefully low. That, or you don't click as fast as some other people&#8230; <br><br>Yes, we were prompted to change this by what we saw on Sullon Zek. Discovering that people could fund blacksmithing fine plate within three days of the server opening using this one baking recipe exclusively was what brought it to our attention. But we would have changed it no matter how it was brought to our attention. The prices were not in line with the goals we have for trade skills. <br><br>There's nothing sinister here. We want people to make money trading their home made goods to players, not to merchants.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html"><b>Lot of RP Server Feedback</b></a><br>Rilauven wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi, I've recently gotten back into EQ and just heard about the Rolepaying Server ideas. Overall I think it's a great idea and I'll definately be making a character there when it goes up, but a couple things worry me. <br><br>First is the langauge barriers. In concept, they're an excellent idea to encourage RP and racial differences. However, I've played on many mud & mush's with language code in place and the reality is that it tends to be a very frustrating detriment to rp. A typical conversation usually goes like this: <br><br>Human: Hello!<br>Elf: vgbbz!<br>Human: what?<br>Elf: Y gfan, Vgbbz!<br>Human: Huh??<br>Elf: hgn'y ubq klaop gntbxzy!?!<br>Human: what the heck are you saying!? <br><br>(At this point both parties give up and go off to roleplay with members of their own race) <br><br>I'd suggest putting a common tounge that's easy to learn even at low levels. Or at the very least, leave in the /ooc channel. Which brings be to the second point. The /ooc channel should be left in! Partially for the reason above, so people have some chat system in place, even if it's just ooc. Groups of friends need a way to find each other to roleplay together. Without an ooc channel, they have no choice but to wander around and hope they bump into someone interesting. This is what the /ooc channel should be for. In the event that this doesn't happen anyway, will we at least have /tell and guildchat that can break language barriers? <br><br>I understand that there needs to be some kind of rule/understanding that ooc, tells and guildchat are strictly ooc, but if ooc communication is taken out completely, it will make finding prefered people to roleplay and group with very, very difficult! Please take these points into condsideration, and thank you for your time. ]</i></font><br><br>You said something that went *ding* for me. <br><br>------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>(At this point both parties give up and go off to roleplay with members of their own race)<br>------------------------------------<br><br>Actually, that's rather the goal of language restrictions. Races in Norrath are rather insular. We want people to spend their lower levels dealing primarily with people of their own species. This promotes community among the races and means that those that can communicate with others outside their race have spent the time and effort to do so. This is exactly what we're looking for. <br><br>Sure, some people will find it frustrating that they have trouble grouping with and communicating with people outside their species. That's unfortunate. But, just like many of our alternate rules servers, the idea here is to make things different in order to promote certain play styles. Here we want to make it harder for people that don't care about the race they have chosen to play as much as they care about getting experience in the most efficient group. <br><br>So, at least in this area, frustrating is just fine. :)<br><br>Choadian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Something that popped into my mind as a potential problem which may escalate to GM/Guide involment is this: How to two groups which don't have a common method of communication work out who is fighting what in an certain location? <br><br>For example lets say you have two groups in Dalnir's, one, all Iksar, are fighting lumpy goos and the other, all non-evil and fresh off the boat wish to hunt nearby. How do they work out things like sharing an area, avoiding trains, how long a group is going to be in a particular area, etc? With no civilized method of working this out ahead of time you're very quickly going to have accidental (?) violations of the Play nice policy. Of course there is always /wave /point and /rude to fall back on. ]</i></font><br><br>Good point. That's something we'll have to figure out. Though I suspect that by the time anyone is fighting in Dalnir's at least one member of each group will know a language that a member of the other group knows. But we will certainly have to look at this issue when it comes time to decide on the customer service aspects of the server. <br><br>Furloaf wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I am wondering how some of the out of character commands will be dealt with on this new server. One that comes to mind is the /location command. Most often this command is used as a cheap guide to easily find an area or place, that is supposed to be hard to find. Limiting this command in some way I think would encourage role-playing, as players will ask other players for help to reach a destination they aren't familiar with. Completely removing the command may not be the best action, because it is very helpful in locating specific area bugs inside a zone. Maybe perhaps limiting the amount of times the /location command can be used in a time period, i.e. adding a "recast" time to the command, like Lay on Hands. Another idea that springs up from the limitation of /location, is to allow Rangers to use the command, or perhaps the classes that can Track. The ability (lowering of the "recast" time) to use /location could be based off of the Track skill. <br><br>Other out of character commands I am wondering about deal with communication. Specifically the Inter-zone and long distance means of communicating. Tell and Guild Chat being the most extreme. These two, as well as Group Chat, from a role-playing perspective make no sense. These commands are hard to recommend changes to. Here roleplaying may have to be bent so that gameplay does not suffer. I myself an unsure on Tells and Guildchat. Group say might be able to change to a more roleplay fashion, without harming gameplay. I envision it not being limited to the members of the group, able to be heard by all around. The area of it will be the same as shout. The difference being that the members of the group would retain the chat color set for /group, so to not make it more difficult for players to group together. <br><br>I am eagerly looking forward to this new proposed server. Please look over my concerns, and do your best to answer. Thanks. ]</i></font><br><br>Some good points. I don't think we discussed /loc at all. I'll bring that up. As far as I'm concerned, we don't need it on the RP server. People can navigate by landmarks, and where there aren't landmarks they can get lost&#8230; I'll circulate the /loc thing around and see what the team thinks. <br><br>/tell we talked about extensively. Honestly, it's just too useful to remove. People are still playing EverQuest as a game. Many folks will just want to chat with a friend when on line. /tell let's them do that. And sometimes, just for the sake of gameplay, you need to talk to someone on the other side of Norrath. <br><br>I'm personally indifferent on guild chat. I see it as a totally ooc channel for friends to babble at each other over. I've heard suggestions that we limit guild chat to city zones only, to sort of represent the guild house, where they can gather and chat&#8230; but I don't see that. <br><br>But I really like your group chat idea. I've always been bothered by seeing groups of people sitting around in zen lotus positions just staring at each other. It's kind of creepy. It's even creepier when you know that they're chatting to each other mentally while they're at it. <br><br>So adding a /say component to group chat is a brilliant idea. Heck, some of the funniest things I've ever heard have been said over group chat, and it's a shame that everyone in the area didn't get to hear them&#8230; <br><br>Thanks for the ideas. <br><br>This next one is long, so I'll respond within the text. <br><br>CohibaAl wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I sent this in yesterday to the Dev Comment link, not sure if that was the correct one to post to. I will resend my comments here to this link again. Please forgive me if this turns up as a repeat then. ]</i></font><br><br>I didn&#8217;t have time to read all of them yesterday, sorry. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I intend to outline several flaws of the proposal to make a server-wide Warrens Loot Code (WLC) combined with universally tradeable items with an example and then discuss several advantages of an alternate method. Please bear with me on the lengthy comments! :)<br><br>The situation you have then would be that items couldn't be farmed by higher levels since the magic items wouldn't drop, yet could be bought from the lower level player that does get it. It sounds great! But for some quest items, the natural rarity of the item, combined with the much more limited pool of possible players to achieve it, would skyrocket the price of many items. This may look good for helping the young players make some money, but with the WLC and the absense of farming the platinum resources of most players would be significantly reduced. ]</i></font><br><br>If items become more rare on this server, I see that as a good thing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Let me give an example to outline this. In my experience I hate farming, worse I hate selling in G-bay (Greater Faydark). So I have sold maybe 4 or 5 items in my whole career total. I have a 50 paladin, a 46 druid, and all total I just now have 4k plat in the bank. Let's pretend this isn't an unreasonably low amount for someone who has played as long as I have, under your new coding. <br><br>1) I have a mid-level druid under the new server. I decide I would like to get a --quest item in question-- (which sells on Tunare for 5k or so). However I don't have 5k or more to buy one outright, and my ability to make money is limited as I can't "farm" anything to sell in order to raise the cash. I start anyway. I hunt in --some place-- and get --item #1--, --item #2--, and --item #3--. I move to --another place-- to camp --some NPC-- for the ---item#4-- only to discover in frustration and dismay (after 5 hours of sitting) that --some NPC-- is green and doesn't drop --item#4-- for me. This worsens my disgust of "evercamp" as any such time spent is now at risk of producing nothing. ]</i></font><br>Examples edited out&#8230; no spoilers here! :)  So you have to buy <item #4> from someone of the appropriate level to get it. I don't see that as an issue. You might even be encouraged to help them hunt in <another place> for a while so they can get it. That's a good thing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2) I look to buy --item #4-- that a lower level has gotten. Supply and demand shows that there really aren't many lower level players that are looking for --item #4-- and so it isn't really camped by them. This drives the price UP (currently --item #4-- alone can sell for 1k). An enterprising young camper realizes this and camps and loots the ring. Supply and demand state he can ask a considerably higher price for it, as most all -class- want a <quest item in question> at some time but only a small level range of players can get --item #4--, and thus there are far fewer available.]</i></font><br> <br>As I said, it's not a bad thing if items become more rare on this server. In fact, I'd call it a good thing. Players on this server might have to adjust and accept that just because they want <quest item in question> does not mean that they will ever get it. I would love to see a server where the items that people think of as 'required' are sometimes just not obtainable. People will quickly discover that those items aren't as indispensable as they think they are. And people that have such items will be that much more unique. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3) Economics shows that he could easily sell for an asking price outside of my range. he would end up selling to a level 55 or 60 player that has access to such a powerful pool of loot to sell or trade, or just more mobs that drop larger amounts of coin. I really wouldn't be able to afford <item #4> and complete my quest until I was nearly at the end-game. ]</i></font><br><br>If that becomes true, then that item is end-game (if you must use that term) loot. If people at 55+ level think it's good enough to buy for their own use, then maybe it should be something that they can't afford until they are higher level&#8230; <br><br>But, most likely people will just be more careful, and make sure to get the quest components for items they know they will want when they are of the appropriate level to get it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4) Enough examples of this and players become very discouraged at questing. Especially the ones that want to experience the game WITHOUT the use of spoiler sites listing the exact levels required to do quests, the ones that want to discover the game on their own as you originally designed it.]</i></font><br> <br>That is a problem. But the problem is that folks think they 'need' stuff that they've read about on spoiler sites, or that their character on some other server has. That's just not the case. It's certainly easier to defeat enemies with better arms and armo(u)r, but it's certainly not required that you have all the best stuff to do anything in EverQuest. Again, maybe this is something that folks playing on this server will have to learn if they want to play there. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I really do see the prices for many quest items skyrocketing out of the range for anyone but the very high levels to attain. This plan would handicap people; prevent them from playing the game as it was intended and worsening the schism between rich uber players and poor average players. Hill Giants would become very very scarce just because they are a mid-level source of money needed to purchase. ]</i></font><br><br>Sorry, but maybe you and I disagree on 'as it was intended'. Powerful items being rare and expensive isn't against any part of 'as it was intended' that I know about&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: THE SOLUTION: make nearly every item NO-DROP! With the exception of player made items, and other things specifically made to be traded, all items being No-Drop would ALSO: <br><br>a) PREVENT FARMING, bottom-feeding or the rest of the goals that your WLC has attempted to fix. No more level 60's farming their 15th FBSS, it's no drop. No more level 60's farming Yakesha swords, they are no drop. This may stabilize the server economy as well. ]</i></font><br><br>You're not exactly correct. It would just produce a different kind of farming. Let's say that a high level character (or guild) wants to get some stuff for his lower level friends or guild members. Rather than bottom feeding the stuff solo, he'll just bring his lower level friends into the zone and have them loot the stuff. Slightly more complicated, but certainly not hard. There would be no less bottom feeding or farming, there would just be more people sitting around watching it happen. The anti-bottom feeding code actually prevents bottom feeding altogether by making it nearly impossible. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: b) SOLVE LOOT DISPUTES. No more hassle over why wizards are randoming warrior equipment or why warriors are randoming caster stuff, it's all no-drop. ]</i></font><br><br>That's true, all no-drop would fix this. However, the real fix to this is that players get along. If there's a warrior in the group that needs an item, let him have it. That's how I play. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: c) IMPROVE TRADE SKILLS. Well, more work needs to be done to make the products of many tradeskills financially viable. This would however improve its chances. More people may buy the racially smithed armor if they can't walk to the nearest bazaar and buy a full suit of rygorr, or worse the mid-level quest armor that was made for questing (that one really blew my mind, buying quest armor: Bah!). ]</i></font><br><br>At the same time, you'd destroy the ability of most tradespeople to even make stuff. They could no longer purchase simple items like ruined pelts. Even with the anti-bottom feeding code they will have trouble getting any magical components. Those are going to get expensive, but then so will the items made from those components&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: c) SOLVE TWINK ISSUE. If you believe that twinking is wrong this would solve that. ]</i></font><br><br>Not really. People would twink just like they would bottom feed; have the twink in the area to loot the item. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: d) AVOID PUNISHING PLAYERS FOR LEVELLING. It allows anyone to finish any quest, regardless of level, and thus not punishing players for simply not having discovered a certain quest until too late! ]</i></font><br><br>True, and this is the major drawback of the anti-bottom feeding code. I don't, however, think that this one selling point makes the idea of turning all items no-drop better than the anti-bottom feeding code. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: e) ENCOURAGES LONG TERM PLAYING. NO-DROP is why everyone wants to level and get into Temple of Veeshan or Sleepers Tomb someday... they see the stuff that comes out of there but can't have any unless they earn it themselves because much of it is not tradable.]</i></font><br> <br>But then, if you've fought your way into the Temple of Veeshan, maybe you deserve the right to give away the stuff you found there. And, well, if seeing the Temple of Veeshan in person isn't enough of a reason to go there, then maybe a roleplaying server isn't the right place for that person to play. Going to a place like that shouldn't be about the loot. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: f) REDUCE PLAYER SCAMS. How many of your Customer Service (CS) responses are due to trade scams? How many are due to people claiming someone logged on their account and traded everything away before de-levelling them 5 times? How much CS time would be saved with the no-drop plan? ]</i></font><br><br>No drop items don't change that. Those people would just destroy the items in question. We're talking about disgruntled spouses, guildmates, roommates, friends&#8230; <br><br>And people that try to scam the GMs by giving items away and then claiming they were scammed&#8230; they don't play EverQuest anymore. While it's a noble idea to try to reduce the workload on the customer service staff, that's not really an issue. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I can't begin to tell you how viable this is, providing you find the right balance of what you determine should be tradable. The game, IMO as it stands now, is often less about playing as it is about the "phat lewt". It's sad, so much of the game is missed with that mindset. Yet the no-drop items would make each player actually earn and feel proud about the armor and items he or she wields and thus return some of the original glory and amazement back to the game. <br><br>Everquest is about adventuring. Not sitting in East Commons or Greater Faydark for days on end trying to buy low and sell high. Atleast this is my vision of the game, and I suspect close to yours too. ]</i></font><br><br>Sure, it is viable. I just don't think it's superior to the other plan, which I'm still not sure I like. Making things no-drop certainly wouldn't change anyone's focus away from the Phat Lewt, if that is their focus. And for some people, playing EverQuest is about sitting in East Commons buying low and selling high. No, that's not what I do when I play. But for some that's the fun part. The no-drop thing really critically impacts trade skills in such a way that I just can't see it working. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I love the ideas so far - but a couple of others that make the "no no-drop" more workable imho: <br><br>a) Must be grouped to trade - this prevents evis from trading with goods - but neutrals could still act as go betweens.<br>b) Trading allowed only in city zones - goes along with the auction channel theme and means evils and goods can trade, but only if they have similar faction somewhere so they dont "hate" each other.<br>c) Trading of lore and formerly no drop items allowed only in city zones (can still trade food or summoned items in the field). <br><br>Love the rule set generally - would make a great server. <br><br>Gypsum ]</i></font><br><br>I don't really like a). But it's an interesting idea. <br><br>b) is pretty darn restrictive&#8230; but it's also an interesting idea. <br><br>c) borders on brilliant, and might be something that can actually be done in code (not that I know, I'm not a programmer&#8230;) <br><br>Thanks for the ideas, I'll pass them on. <br><br>Beldukil wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Wouldnt there be a problem with neutrals having too much flexibility. There should definitely be an advantage to being good or evil just as neutrality has its advantages. <br><br>Also some classes are almost necessary for the high end game, like rogues. Are rogues necesarily evil? ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, it might be important to add some incentive to being extremely good or evil. That's certainly on our list of things to look at. <br><br>And rogues might very well range from good to evil, I don't know. But I don't see why they would have to be evil. Robin Hood wasn't evil&#8230; :)  We haven't worked out the alignment chart yet, so I can't answer that for sure. <br><br>Sengan wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well a couple of things seem to be off with the rules suggestions. <br><br>First, if neutrals can be buffed and healed by anyone, why would someone play a non-neutral? Sure, many will, but the neutrals are likely to way outbalance the non-neutrals, particularly if they include the main classes (cleric,caster of some form, warrior of some form). <br><br>Languages,/ooc,/auction/shout - sounds like a move to make this a server of isolation rather than commmunity. I can easily see groups of trolls, who could care less about interacting with humans, etc. In a PvE environment, no reason for them to interact. They form a troll guild, travel in troll groups, take care of their factions with the npcs so they can travel pretty much anywhere, take down dragons and other high level things with trolls only, etc. There is little incentive to work with the human,dwarf etc players. They can go anywhere (once they establish some faction with the local merchants or guards) and have no need to interact with people from the other races. Rather than making a community, the proposed rules sound like they are designed to make many smaller communities on the server with none of them having any great need to interact with the other communities. In a PvP world like Sullon, the trolls could be attacked by the human players, in a PvE world though, the players are irrelevant and the npc's are what matter. Some of the things one does in the game would be easier if you took the time to learn the other peoples languages, but not easier enough to necessarily make it worth while doing. Likewise trading - you can sell to another troll as easily as you can sell to a human, so if you dont want to take time learning human speech, just sell to your own isolated community. <br><br>Maybe it is just me, but the strengths of the game have always been the community, the commmunications, the interaction. Too many of these rules seem designed as being the opposite of all of those. If the proposed rules indicated that npc's were going to be downgraded, it sounds like the kind of rules you would make for a solo player server more than a role-play server. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, it also seems more natural to me that the majority of the world be neutral. But we're hoping that enough people will play on the extremes to keep things fun. I suspect that a lot of the people that choose to play on this server will choose to be something extreme, like a paladin or a cleric to Innoruuk. But, as I mentioned, we'll certainly keep our eyes open for the need for incentives to play evil and good. <br><br>And we're not taking about creating solo play here, what we're doing is reducing the size of the community for the lower level characters. Trolls will hang out with trolls. Ogres will hang out with ogres. That seems more natural than having Trolls work their faction up with some group so that they can more easily group with humans&#8230; We want a more insular feeling, more of a dedication to your race than you might see on other servers. If a lot of dwarf only, elf only, troll only guilds form on this server, that's great. <br><br>We're not eliminating the community at all, we're just cutting it up into smaller pieces. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: How would the language change affect those classes (rogue, bard, enchanter) that are capable of taking on the guise of another race? Part of the aspect of roleplay for these classes would be to master illusions in certain situations, yet their language would impair them from being able to completely pull it off. <br><br>-Jade ]</i></font><br><br>Great, isn't it! <br><br>Yes, if you want to pretend to be a dark elf, you might want to learn the language&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm happy to hear that this idea is moving forward. But in terms of practicality, given that everyone will be anonymous and shout being reduced in range, won't it be difficult to find groups in the larger zones? <br><br>--<br>Orfeo Calliopen<br>30 Bard<br>Ayonae Ro ]</i></font><br><br>It sure will. Maybe, just maybe, on this server people will be meeting in town to gather their groups to go adventuring. Leveling will probably be slower on this server, and that's fine too. Remember, when roleplaying it is the journey that is the adventure, not how fast you make it. <br><br>To answer a couple of questions that I've seen but didn't want to paste the whole comment here: Yes, there will be agnostics on this server. No, we don't know when this will go live. I wouldn't expect it soon. Just like Sullon, this server will take a lot of special coding and testing. While we're enthusiastic about this idea, we have a lot of stuff to work on right now that will probably take priority over such a server.<br> <br>Thanks for the 427 comments you've sent in so far. It's sure kept me busy reading&#8230; :)</UL>

Alan VanCouvering <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000241.html">added this announcement</a> to the Developer's Corner regarding the Sullon Zek server:<UL>Here is a note from Hobart about some stuff we still plan to do with Sullon.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I wanted to give some information on what we are still planning to do with Sullon.<br><br>The first thing that will always be in progress is adding Sullon specific content. You will notice that their a some new NPC's that will start to appear on this server to guide and explain the rules and what options you may have as a member of a certain Deity Alliance.<br><br>For Example: The first set of NPC's will offer an item for a small donation that will allow players to identify players of another alliance through armor tints. This NPC will also explain in more detail how Insignias work, and what they may be used for in the future. NOTE: Not all these NPC's are done for every deity. They will be completed and patched as time permits.<br><br>The second topic is team balance.<br><br>Very soon, there will be methods to determine outside the game what team has control of what areas. The strength and maybe some other stats about that team will be shown. We may increase or decrease the reward for a particular alliance based on this information. An example would be offering a larger bounty for the insignia of a slain Cazic Thule follower over the insignia of a slain Tunare follower.<br><br>On this same topic will be slightly changing the way teams identify each other through /con. We will be changing it such that each team will be able to tell which team his target is aligned with. This will help those who wish to form a temporary alliance with another team.<br><br>Other gameplay issues.<br><br>We will be removing the below level 6 PvP immunity in mid to high level adventure zones. This will be done to prevent players below level 6 from causing grief without the higher level players having a means to retaliate. A prime example of this is the level 5 bard training sand giants in the oasis. Because this would be considered a mid level adventure zone, the level 5 bard could and would most likely be killed by another player. This will indeed make the trek from one city to another, which is currently pretty safe for players below level 6, much more difficult if it involves going through adventure zones.<br><br>Example zones where the below 6 PvP immunity would remain would be: Nektulos, Qeynos Hills, Innothule, and East Commons. These are just some of the examples. We will provide a full list or provide an in-game method of notifying the player when he enters one of the zones where this is implemented.<br><br>We will be removing the ability for bards to use songs on boats. Following shortly behind that will come the removal of any melee combat on the boats. Before doing this, we will be taking a look at ways of insuring the safety of a traveler on a boat from NPC's in the ocean.<br><br>We will be also changing the way PvP experience loss works on Sullon. The current problem is that a high level player can repeatedly kill lower level players without risk. The higher level player can continue to harass these lower level players without risk of experience or coin loss for any amount of time. While one could use the same argument that the lower level players are also losing nothing, we feel there should be some innate risk with a higher level player bottom feeding these lower level players. With this change, it will make higher level players think twice before attacking low level players. This will also give groups of lower level players an incentive to group up and take on higher level adversaries. So we intend to change the rules so that any character killed by a lower level character will lose experience. Along with the experience loss, the killing person will be given looting rights also.<br><br>Hobart Wolfkin<br>Barbarian Warrior<br>The Tribunal<br><br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>We'll continue to evaluate the server rules as the server matures.<br><br>Alan</UL>

New message is up on the Patch Server:<UL>July 10th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br><br>** Bug Fixes **<br><br>- The "NPC unerringly sticks on pet" AI bug implemented in the last patch has been fixed.  This resolves a bug that occurred a short while ago that would cause pets to be the focus for most attacks by NPCs.<br><br>- Fixed the animation problem where an animation played on the upper body would get stuck.  This could be seen by starting to cast a spell and then walking forward while it was playing the casting animation.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow a player to target an invisible PC or NPC with the F7 or F8 keys even if they had See Invisible up.<br><br>- Stacking issues with 'change form' type spells have been corrected.  Lich and Clarity will no longer stack, nor will Spirit of Wolf and Wolf Form.<br><br>- The bug with screenshots that some people experienced when using 32-bit color mode should be fixed.<br><br><br>** Item and Vendor Adjustments **<br><br>- Changed the forged Antonian Javelins to be stackable.<br><br>- Gnome Skin Sleeves are now droppable and rentable.<br><br>- Spiderling and Spider Silks are now stackable<br><br>- Spider Legs are now stackable.<br><br>- Tarnished weapons worth slightly more to the vendors than the rusty ones.<br><br>- Reduced the weight of the monk only Black Pantherskin armor.<br><br>- All Sheets of metal and Folded Sheets of metal are now stackable.<br><br>- Rangers will now be able to wear Girdle of Reflection<br><br>- There is now a vendor in Felwithe that sells the Enchant Ores series of enchanter spells.<br><br><br>** Zone and Quest Changes **<br><br>-  The Crazed Ghouls should be less of a problem in Unrest.<br><br>- The Monk red headband quest should now be available again.<br><br>- We've added a few more Yew Leaf spawns.<br><br>- Reevaluated the values of the various fish fillets.  All fish vendors should return to normal, but they won't be paying as well for certain fishy items.  This resolves a problem that was created with the increased value of player made food items all over Norrath.  Some of food items were made too valuable, and merchants were complaining to their union leaders...<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br><br>** Gen Con Event **<br><br>Sony Online Entertainment cordially invites you to participate in a special online tournament of gladiatorial combat to be held at GenCon in August.<br><br>When: August 2-5, 2001 (pre-registration for GenCon ends July 9, 2001) <br>Where: Milwaukee Wisconsin at the Midwest Express Center <br><br>Join us and the 26,000 other people that will be attending the nation's largest gaming convention.

As traditional for any of his articles, Shadoe has finished the <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid994800308,21053,">Reader Response Edition</a> for his latest editorial.  You may recall the topic of that particular editorial focused on SOE's announcement of a Character Transfer Service.  Here's a clip:<UL>If there's one thing I want to stress to the readers, it's that "sticking it to the players" was not the core issue of this article. If I had to narrow it down to one statement (and it so turns out that I do), it's about the act of compromising principle, and money plays a huge part of it. For those of you who loathe Verant for their "corporate fat cat" attitude, let me point out that if I ever once had the opportunity to make the kind of money that's at stake here, I wouldn't so much as blink before I took advantage of it to its fullest. Most of you would do the same. To reiterate: It's how capitalism works, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. <br><br>But I would also call a spade a spade, and face up to what it is I'm doing. I also like to believe that if there were moral grounds not to take advantage of such an opportunity, that I'd at least seriously consider passing it by. A reason like, say, the good of the game I was hosting, and the players who rely on me to uphold those moral reasons. <br><br>In his post, our own Mr. McQuaid makes the claim that Verant has, in fact, not abandoned their past reasons for refusing character transfers. True to proper form, he has bulleted the specifics behind his claim, and here are my thoughts on each of them... </UL>Thanks Shadoe!
