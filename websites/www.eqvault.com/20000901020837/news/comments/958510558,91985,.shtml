DUH!!! Of course it unbalances the game. You need to get a caster to do it for you just like we need a tank to protect us as we nuke. The whole point is about class inter dependancy.  Get a clue.

Hows that!  Verant has no customer service period, they really should focus on correcting there actions and statements towards their clients.  Very poor on Verant's part, and Im offended that they even posted those remarks on their snobish attitudes towards an overwhelming demand from their user base.<br><br>BTW BIND should not be compared to a SoW, Heal, or any other buff out there, it is a necessity of the game as a starting point for adventuring.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Whats the big deal? Why should a melee have to wait half an hour for a bind? How's it unbalancing? Class interdependancy? Uh come on, whats next, melees need a caster to buy food and purchase items also? Casters have to help melees goto the bathroom, get dressed, tie their shoes? This is just retarded, it IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER EFFECTS GAMEPLAY BALANCE. When Verant put this game out, they invisioned casters always being inside a city offering binds for money, when in reality any caster would rather be outside getting exp and loot, not spamming the /ooc's. Another example of Verant being too lazy to make changes that should have been in the game, in the first place.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Bob Aboey end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Abashi you are SERIOUSLY overestimating the effect this has on class interdependence, and you are overestimating the intelligence of most players. Honestly, who works to keep the melees alive at all costs, just so they don't have to get sent a 2 hour walk away when they die?? No one cares, they just find a new melee guy for the group. So I get forced to walk for hours because some idiot would rather save his own ass than heal me. IF YOU MADE THE PRICE OF BINDS BY AN NPC OVER 10 PLAT, PEOPLE WOULD STILL SEEK OUT PLAYERS TO DO IT. Therefore, class interdependence is still there, and we have the NPC's for the horrible nights where we spend hours trying to find a bind. I never thought I would be one of these people yelling at Verant but they are right, the way you handle customers sucks and you can't be open minded enough to admit that maybe just maybe we have the right idea.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Your<br>logic does not fly.  This is not a NEW ability being<br>provided to melee'ers. The suggestion is to pay an<br>inflated price to a NPC for something that they can<br>already get.  I happen to think its a great idea and<br>will have the added benefit of actually removing wealth<br>from the game.

I actually agree with Gordon's comments. If this was such a big issue, then there wouldn't be any level 50+ warriors, Paladins, Shadow Knights, or Monks. But in fact, there are many of them. So, stop whining. From my experience, from EQ launch to present day, through Kunark and everything, I've never had any problems with their customer service. Maybe sometimes the problem is that they can't understand what some of you are saying. Ex :<br><br>Player : &quot;dewd, cn u bnd my rng to hhk?&quot;<br><br>Yeah, that's right. I have recently started a warrior, now level 21, and never had a problem getting a bind. And, I was a guide for about 3 months, and found that all my fellow guides and aprentices were rather nice to me, and all the people that asked questions. So shut up about binding, it's dumb and balanced as it is, your just whining because you can't get what you want. And that's the way life always is. So tough luck. <!--ktalk end_comment-->

There's cirtain aspects of balance that can't be swayed by a mere majority vote.  Everquest is not a democracy - no game is - if it were then the majority of us who don't care about game balance would screw it up immediately.<br><br>A note to Aurum - I've noticed a disturbing trend in your voting system.  You tend to base votes on things that you would like in teh game, knowing full well that people will likely vote for it, just out of human nature's way of going for the path of least resistance.  You give no consideration towards the designer's perspective.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Having melees bind in Cities I see ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG with it.  It just means I dont have to labor my ass over there to go bind them if they are even 2 zones away or have to bother going /tell &quot;Can you please bind me?&quot; IT's just a PAIN and is definitely not worth the trouble.  Although I think Abashi is a voice for Verant, I do feel he's inexperienced in EQ.  He obviously does not play a lot of classes aside from his necro or his test server buff.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Gandolfini end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->look...the thing isn't so much that we have to bug pople for a bind, and there aren;t always people there, it is the bind locations available to us.  To hunt in Unrest or Dagnor's I have to get bound in GFAY or Kaladim which is a good distance walk.  Now, I would liek to see you wizzies who can bind, try to take mobs on when ur tanks have been walking back to their corpses for 2 hours.  Seriously, maybe paying a NPC would be good, I like the idea, one thing I kinda see a problem  with is Bind Rushing.  If you are on a PVP type server or are PVP, u can rush a caster with no mana after u loot just ur sword, or if you are a monk just jump him.  I generally have no trouble getting a bind, but often hate tping into BB, then going into GFAY, then going back to BB, to Dagnors, then to Unrest, while a caster goes...BB-Dag-Unrest.  To get their corpse, they zone once, and there it is. I have thought up a solution to this problem:<br><br>BIND POTIONS!!!<br><br>A guy earlier said, why not just pay a NPC for SOW's or buffs, or heals...well, in essence we kinda can with potions (all be it a PC, and not all those spells can be made into potions.) By making a bind potion, the melle character would drink it and bind, that easy, it would also help to add a boost to the alreayd crappy shammy alchemy skill (Another problem Vernat has dodged) , but that is another case...<br><br>Sincerely<br>Gandolfini<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I think all those who think that allowing melee to pay a NPC to bind in cities should stop sniffing the lighter fluid and use the little bit of gray matter they have left to understand the whole point of the matter.  Bind points are not part of playing the game, just necessary part of the system of gameplay.  <!--ktalk end_comment-->

You do a poll of people that are a representative sample (which this may not be) and then extrapolate.  The actually amount polled here is probably enough of a sample size as only 200,000 people play.  It's probably not representative of the Everquest population as a whole though and that is a problem.  People being able to probably vote more than once, also poses a problem.  If both of these things could be taken care of then these polls would be worthwhile.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Forget this &quot;being out for a year excuse&quot;. Sure in &quot;old EQ&quot; it wasn't that big of a deal because cities were everywhere and portals were also never more than a few zones away.  With Kunark there is one port in location and maybe 3 melee bind spots in THE WHOLE CONTINENT!  That's what really bothers me.  A person capable of binding and gating can travel 2x as fast as me at a minimum because technically all their trips can be one way.  (walk from A to B, then gate back to A) Melee's have to walk everywhere.  I just wish Verant would lend a sympathetic ear when it comes to Kunark bind debates =(<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Ogres only casting class is shamans and not many of them are just sitting in the city unless they or some other Dark Elf or evil caster is just passing through. Most of the ogres that hang in Ogguk are to low to bind anyways. This issue really isn't only in Ogguk cause sometimes theres just no one in a city.<br> If you really want to make it so it doesn't effect the newbie economy just make npc binds expensive so only way you'd really do it is if you've been sitting around for an hour looking for a bind and its obvious your desperate.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Hell, we are the ones who get hit, we were made to be so, we were not created to have casters keep us alive.  A lvl 50 melee class cant even solo a sand giant, where lvl 50 casters just cast two spells on it and the thing never comes close to them before it drops dead.  THIS IS CLASS BALANCE!?!?!?  You also have us rely on running everywhere, it is not fun to run from Odus to Freeport only to be killed by a Griffon in the commonlands.Now because nobody would bind you in Qeynos or Highpass you have to run across the world.  And I think the one thing over all which upsets melee classes is going to an ocean to hunt.  You get there you hunt, you get one boat, you wait, then you get back.  I have never complained before about class balance because if you dont like it, you can pick another class.  Well I started with a caster, but I think that fighting is much better than casting so I am left out.  I can play a caster and not have fun because of low melee abilities or play a tank and be unhappy because of the hours wasted because of greedy people who want me to pay them 10pp for a bind.  (10pp is a lot of money to me, if you think it is not a lot then give it out to people :p)<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email cralis@home.com end_email start_name Rupert end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->I'm going to apply the recent logical fallacies list to this arguement. Unfortunately, most of them have been used, which means that people are argueing for the sake of argueing, rather than actually viewing the topic for what it is.<br><br>Now what is funny is that most of these arguements have been issued by Gordon!<br><br>1. False Dilemma<br>&quot;We can't just let everyone bind themselves&quot;<br>FACT: Nobody is saying that melee players should be able to bind, only that they should have ready access to being able to be bound.<br><br>2. Arguement from ignorance<br>&quot;The game has been out for over a year. In that time, melee characters have survived and prospered, even though the binding arrangements haven't changed.&quot;<br>FACT: Gordon, please. Your argueing that just because we haven't proved that warriors need to have better binding arrangements, that our premises must be false. It is a matter of convenience, not necessity. Nobody ever blamed the players at 2:34am because he was the only warrior in Qeynos at the time, we cursed Verant for not providing us with a quick way to be bound when nobody else is around.<br><br>4. Appeal to pity<br>&quot;We are tired of having to deal with this topic&quot;<br>FACT: Maybe it's because your finally running out of excuses.<br><br>5. Appeal to Consequences<br>&quot;Melee characters will continue to thrive without implementing something such as this that would drastically change the pace of the game, game balance, class interdependency, and the penalty for death. &quot;<br>FACT: Prove it. I dare you. Put it on the test server. Fact is that you are simply using that arguement to try and put an emotional one over on us. <br><br>6. Prejudicial Language<br>&quot;Gordon is so stupid&quot;<br>FACT: Ok, I'm coming out on Gordon's side with this one. I don't think he's stupid, your just flinging an insult. I think he's sometimes misinformed, perhaps brainwashed, and arrogant. But he has some smarts. Unfortunately arrogance + intelligence = ignorance.<br><br>7. Appeal to popularity<br>&quot;70% of the players want this!&quot;<br>FACT: Gordon is right when he says that they cannot just appeal to the popular opinion. Unfortunately this is the ONLY factual arguement he has on this subject, and it doesn't even deal with the subject itself&quot;<br><br>11 and 12. Hasty Generalization and Unrepresentative sample.<br><br>I'm taking this separate because I think that polling 10% of the population is at least enough to get a general idea for a sample. While an arguement can be made that others might feel different, it is also just as likely that the poll is correct within +-10%<br><br>13. False Analogy<br>&quot;If melee'ers can be bound at any time then melee'ers will become too powerful&quot;<br>FACT: Your comparing convenience to power? What? The fact is that the only difference between an NPC binder and a player binder is cost and availability. The NPC is a backup that costs a lot of money (say 10-15plat). I believe that most people would be more inclined to have a player bind them for 1 plat then an NPC which costs 10x as much. In addition, the NPC would cost too much for low level characters so they would still require player assistence.<br><br>14. Slothful Induction<br>&quot;An NPC binder would destroy game balance&quot;<br>FACT: This has not been proven. You have not proven that the NPC binder would change the current binding arrangement. The only difference is who bound you.<br><br>15. Accident<br>&quot;We want people to depend upon each other&quot;<br>FACT: This only works if there are people to depend upon. This is a special case, there is a need for NPC binders at late night when fewer people are online and often you don't see a caster within 2 zones of a city for 20 minutes or more.<br><br>17. Coincidental Correlation<br>&quot;Binding is an essential part of the caster's part in the player economy&quot;<br>FACT: Binding MUST occur no matter what. Even you agree with that. Nobody would be able to adventure very far if you had to restart in your home town when you died. Now your trying to say that because binding must occur, and that casters can bind, that binding is an essential part of the player economy?<br><br>18. Complex Case<br>&quot;Melee players shouldn't have any problem getting bound. You just need to interact more often&quot;<br>FACT: There is more involved than just interaction. You have to find the right kind of player, other melee players just can't bind you. You have to be in a city zone, not any zone will do. And you generally have to be able to afford it, or else you will keep on waiting. Truth is that the only impact an NPC binder will have is that having a caster _player_ is no longer a necessity. Its nice, it costs less, but it doesn't change ANYTHING about the binding configuration as it stands.<br><br>19. Straw man<br>&quot;Binding is a game balance issue, and your just not seeing it correctly&quot;<br>FACT: We are not talking about changing how binding works, we are talking about changing the inconvenience of binding when there are few players on the server. An NPC binder would alleviate situations where nobody who is suitable AND WILLING (important part) is around to bind you. It doesn't change where you have to get bound (in fact you have to be bound wherever the NPC is, and that might be more inconvenient than if you found a caster to bind you at the front gates), and it doesn't change the fact that it costs to get bound (it can cost more as incentive to find someone else).<br><br>20. Composition<br>&quot;Most people in guilds don't have a problem getting someone to come bind them&quot;<br>FACT: Not everyone is in a guild. You cannot point to that one group of players and prove something about all players.<br><br>21. Division<br>&quot;Binding is balanced between the classes&quot;<br>FACT: Just because a caster has no problem binding himself to a city, does not mean that a melee'er has no problem. Remember he's dependent upon the caster to be there and willing to bind him.<br><br>Final thought:<br>&quot;It reduces class interdependency, the penalty for death, the incentive for people to protect the melee characters at all costs, and the incentive to avoid getting in over your head.&quot;<br><br>FACT: Death has the penalty of being moved to your bind spot (not to mention experience and time, but we wont go there). This bind spot is intended to move around from city to city to allow you to move to other areas of the game and still be able to get back to your group before they have to logoff and goto sleep for the night.<br>FACT: Binding itself does not unbalance the game. Only who can bind and where. Binding is necessary to be able to fight in other parts of the world.<br>FACT: Anyone can be bound in a city zone.<br>FACT: The only people who can bind are casters. Every other class requires two players - the binder and the bindee.<br>FACT: An NPC binder does not change any of the facts above. He simply provides a binder when there is none, but at a cost.<br><br>If the NPC charges more to bind and there are player casters around, players are more likely to choose a player caster over an NPC. The only difference between being bound by a player caster and an NPC binder is the source and availability. <br><br>FACT: The cities do get very lonely at late nights PST/PDT. I have seen it when there are 4 melee'ers looking to be bound, and the nearest caster was 3 zones away. Granted this does not occur all the time in all the cities, but it does happen frequently at late night.<br><br>What more do you need to know Gordon?<br><br>- Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

They state that casters need tanks as much as tanks need casters.  This I learn to be incorrect.  My friend a lvl 43 wizard has at no time had a problem with soloing.  They dont need tanks they just use them if the want them.  I know in dungoens they are needed but for the everyday exploration melees are less needed.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Me Lee end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Ok alot of you idiots are missing the point with your deadhorse comments, only proving a vast number of EQ players are as dumb as Gordan thinks... go figure, thats probably why they get away with uch crappy PR and customer care.  <br>Anyway the point is for some people there is not always a person on to receive a bind from, for me this is a very real situation because I don't play on the CAREBEAR servers like most of you people who are whining about people 'beating a dead horse'.   I play on race war and if you hadn't noticed we have the least amount of players of almost any server.  I have played many a day and night where there were no people to bind me anywhere.  And in some cases people even look to PK you if your in their city asking for a bind.  This means that they get my 10p for the bind I was asking for and I get to take a 1-3 hour walk back to where my body is lieing.  Now I know for you CAREBEAR wimps it is not going to be possible to get you to understand how this dynamic makes being Melee miserable.<br>Anyway...  Gordan complately missed the point of that post, is he a complete schmuck or is it just me?  Habla espaniol Gordan?  The person who posted was talking about a NPC who binds in major cities not in every zone.  And then out comes Gordan's practiced response to an issue not even being addressed, what a putz!  Gordan learn how to read, reason or think, this is ridiculous.  Even if you don't want to make the changes in the game please address the real issue don't throw out RED HERRINGS, it only makes you look ridiculously stupid to those of us who know better and are obviously more intelligent than you, heh.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name  end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->example: My warrior is traveling from Freeport to his him in halas. After an unsuccessful attempt<br>of being bound in HighPass; everyone there that could bind, either ignored my pleas or were too busy<br>with their own group ( understandable, and i dont blame them). After treking across the Karanas and through <br>BlackBurrow, I arrive at Everfrost. I immediately call out that I am looking to PURCHASE a bind. Again no responce. <br>Why? This is the usual breakdown of people in Everfrost. Players that are near the Halas zone are not high enough <br>level to provide a bind, Remember Shamans need to be 14th level. People hunting near one guard, still on the fringe <br>of being able to provide a bind. Then there are the people at orc wall. Here we are starting to get the casters that can bind<br>. But that would require them to stop what they are doing, trek all the way back to the Halas zone and help me out. <br>This sometimes happens, sometimes not. The higher levels near Perma, or those hunting Mammoths and Icey orcs. Same scenario. <br>They would have to stop what they are doing and rush all the way back to help me out. Finally after my calls for a bind are <br>declined, I decide to try my luck to find a caster in Halas. HA. You will be very lucky to find a caster there, or anyone else for<br>that matter, especially during non-peak hours. I still have options, I could try Qeynos, I could try adventuring in Everfrost with<br>the very real chance of a long run if I die, or, as I normally do, I camp and play another game, and maybe this is the time that<br>I realize the other software companies' games are more appealing to me than EQ (more and more likely each day). Having an NPC that <br>for a price provides a service that casters ALREADY provide, if they are available, does not change the game. Make a fee required that<br>would be high enough that anyone would prefer a player caster, and I really dont see a problem. We non casters are still going to get <br>that bind, in a city zone. But give us an option when they're are no caster-binders around.<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

This should scare you all BTW....  This means they learned from UO and plan on just letting the game peter out and end as new games release.  <br>PREMISE:  Towards the end despite having nothing to lose and despite having BEATEN A DEADHORSE (i.e.--the customer), they will out of pity make alot of changes that we wanted them to make that they were to stubborn to make at this current time.  Why not, at that point they won't care anymore about their so called &quot;balance&quot; (which in programming online terms really means:  balance=changing things in game so people an milk them for more money) and will slowly adhere to most changes people want made majority wise, simply to wring any last profits out of the game until they have to end it because maintaining the last remaining servers isn't worth the money when they could use the equipment for something like Star Wars online.<br>FACT: I won't be playing EQ and after my experience with Verant and its lack of PR I, and I certainly hope you, will not buy or play Star Wars online or any other product put out by Verant.<br><br>Thank you for your time....  <br>(wouldn't it be nice if Verant were this polite--got to love how Gordan's response was so off the mark of the subject that it seemed pedantic and even obnoxious, but this is the gist of Verant customer care...)<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I already own the bind affinity spell in anticiapation of when i reach lvl 14 and can finally have a spell that people will pay me good money to cast for them. If melee characters want to lessen the value of having my class along in a party or as a friend, then I would like to also lessen their value by being able to hire an NPC to come out and tank for me. It is that simple, as it stands now melee characters need casters and casters need melee characters, I think it is great. If you wish to play a melee character and not be dependant on casters to help you with spells then maybe you should get out of the multiplayer universe and find a nice little 1 person game to play. <!--ktalk end_comment-->

So far 'most' everything that has been changed for 'BALANCE' reasons was really changed because the EQ population as a whole was leveling too quick, so the changes were made to slow people down.  If you have been here as long as me, you would know that all the changes that are made  to these so called &quot;balance issues&quot; are made after Abaashi and others, who play their own game, have abused the so called 'unbalanced element'.  But, can't really blame them for abusing their own game, I guess anyone with ridiculous amounts of power over their daily 'imaginary world' would want to be a little Hitler also, I think.  Is this why Verant waited for Abaashi to get a manastone for his Necro on the RW server and rubicite for his other characters before removing them from the game?  I don';t think its coincidence...  Anyway all I can say is the feeling is mutual, they obviously respect us customers as much as I respect them right now.  We can all just reason that respect is non existent when it comes to EQ.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Try addressing the issue.  If an NPC in town charges 10-20p per bind that doesn't effect you at all.  If you sit their auctioning for 5p, BTW I would never pay more than 5p from a fellow player anyway, you will always find people coming to you for binds if they can't get one for free.  Why the hell would they go to an NPC and pay 3 to 4 times that amount, duh?!?  LoL  they shouldn't let people below the 40th percentile post on the internet period.  Some people are dumber than dumber.  &lt;btw, yes for the most parts I am insulting you, simply because you must not have read anyything here before you posted.

Flinging insults at people for expressing their opinions probably isnt the most constructive use of your demonstrated intelligence.  Now, that being said, Im extremely impressed with Rupert's post...He hits everything right on the bullseye.  Verant is trying to argue against this idea with faulty logic.  I dont think Verant wants to give its customers that much control because they will be forever bowing to our wants and desires and loose complete control.  Once this occurs, we will leave for newer games because this one became less challenging...possibly because Verant couldnt keep us on their leash (sp) anymore.  Verants Vison(TM) is becoming clear to me now:  DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO KEEP THE CUSTOMER HOOKED AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO WE CAN MAKE MORE MONEY.  Its a slap in the face but its true. <!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Babb end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Get real. How can anyone believe this is going to throw the games balance off? It's a bind offered at a higher cost then that which the player would normally pay otherwise to a pc. Why? Because, for those moments when you log and CAN NOT find a bind. Period. You have none of your friends on because maybe you logged at an unusual time or no one is willing. Is this really the same as the dependency you would have for other spells like SoW or something of that nature? I don't think so. It's about an OPTION. Who isn't going to try to pay 1pp or less for a bind from a pc if they can. I always bind for free and have found that most others do to. And even if the first option for someone would be to just pay the higher cost and get it from the npc, so what? Isn't having the option there worth more than a small, missed player- interaction? I mean, come on, the rest of the time when you're not binding is player interaction left and right. This is just a no-brainer to me.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email cralis@home.com end_email start_name Rupert end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->For the record I don't play EQ anymore, I play AC (and when Shadowbane comes out...whoa momma I'm going to own your server...just watch me). I just posted on this topic because it was a gritch of mine when I ran an EQ web site. I'm actually a fellow game (ok board game) developer and I hate to see a company that is this large AND this ignorant become a standard for other companies. <br><br>Think about it. If it's ok for Verant to ignore their customers, provide little to no customer support, and provide unbalanced gameplay... <br><br>How many up and coming game developers will think the same thing? Their investors only care about numbers, and that is one of the few things that EQ does have. Often the investors or managers win out over the developers, and they will usually win out when trying to &quot;emulate success&quot;.<br><br>To recap I'm not fighting because I believe EQ can fulfill it's potential...its too late. I'm fighting because I don't want to see a good idea ruined in the future because the company president or investors saw $$$ in Verant's strategy and modeled their company and processes (hah like Verant has any) after them. <br><br>Oh and PS. I took a class in logic in college, but I got all of these from the posting to the EQ message boards that made the news here on EQ Vault...you know the one that Gordon said we should all read :-)<br> <br>- Rupert<br>Get process. Does the program good.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Some guy end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->DOn't know if it's too late for anyone to read this but...<br><br>Gordon seems to be all about &quot;class interdependency&quot;, which I am all for.  However, what he is conveniently forgetting is that most caster classes, particularly pet classes, can pretty much solo their whole lives without being dependant on anybody.  Why?  Because they get powerful pets and magical goodies like bind, teleport, DOTs, etc.<br><br>Melee classes have to be dependant on caster classes.  Why?  BECAUSE VERANT PUBLICALLY SAID SO!  This is fact, it's been said.<br><br>How come caster classes can solo so easily, yet melee classes have to be dependent on caster classes?<br><br>How in the hell would putting Binding NPCs in city zones unbalance the game?  Especially if those NPC charge outrageously high prices like 10-20pp?  IMO, any function that reduces the net amount of money in the world is a good thing.  Just look at all those older servers.  How many times have you heard someone say that platinum was worthless because everybody has thousands on hand at all times?<br><br>Put in some more money sinks, Verant.  The Binding NPCs sounds like a good start.<br><br>Some Guy<br>Still unbelieving of the &quot;class interdependency&quot; BS...<!--ktalk end_comment-->

They're called PETS.<br><br>Also, to #53: You are flat wrong about casters needing melee and melee needing casters.  Casters DO NOT need melee.  Necromancers and Magicians are arguably the two best solo classes in the game.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

He stated that melee classes have prospered quite well without any sort of easy bind methods other than Player bound in cities.  I hate to burst Gordon's little bubble, but melee classes us to be able to obtain an item  (ring-1 charge) that allowed them to bind anywhere they chose to bind themselves.  So that little episode he gave for the so-called reason for the subject to be a dead horse is in all truth... FALSE!!  The ring was not the easiest piece of  equipment to obtain and not many had one in possession, however about 4 months into release Verant was kind enough to remove the object.<!--ktalk end_comment-->
