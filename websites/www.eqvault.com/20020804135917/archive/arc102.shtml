Here's today's message following the patch that was implemented today:<UL>June 15th, 8:00am<br>-----------------<br> <br>*Patch Day*<br> <br>Hello everyone,<br> <br>Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on The Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future.  Even so, a number of changes and additions were made in today's patch.  Most of the changes are in regards to quests:<br> <br>- The "Fleshy Orb" quest has been completed<br>- We've received word that "Fabian" has been spotted somewhere on Norrath.<br>- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly.<br>- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<br>- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the Lost Circle.  <br> <br>A few items have also been changed this week:<br> <br>- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.<br>- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a short casting time associated with their activatable effect (See Below).<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when you log off (See Below.)<br> <br><br>*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*<br> <br>We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to "spam" other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to disconnect.  Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages caused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.  <br> <br>The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have to stand still to use them now.<br> <br>*Gunthak Harpoon*<br> <br>In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon "rentable", meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff.  Basically, one of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it must be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.  Unfortunately, the stats on this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical composition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in obtaining it.  <br> <br>For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the next time that you log out.  This is a retroactive change and will affect weapons already in possession.  We do apologize to those who acquired it within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon.<br> <br>*Chat / Login Process*<br><br>Due to the rapidly increasing number of people playing EverQuest, the Chat<br>and Login processes have been moved to more robust servers. This should<br>increase the capabilities of both servers and help alleviate the congestion<br>experienced by some during periods of high utilization.<br> <br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Alexisi!

The blokes at GameSpot UK have kicked up their <a href="http://www.gamespot.co.uk/pc.gamespot/rpg/ruins_uk/review.html">review of the EQ expansion The Ruins of Kunark</a>.  In the end the reviewer awards Kunark with a 9/10 rating.  Here's a blurb:<UL>If you're a long-term EverQuester, you won't think twice before purchasing this upgrade. The new areas offer an exciting challenge for seasoned players and advancement for those who have hit the limit in the original game. The hostility of the new environments and the vastness of the new zones might put off the more casual player, especially as the restrictive binding rules on the new continent make lengthy hikes across zones a necessary evil. </UL>Additionally a photogallery can be found by <a href="http://www.gamespot.co.uk/pc.gamespot/rpg/ruins_uk/screenshot1.html">clicking here</a>.

I received the following report from Caleryn:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night, my guild The AnDarim on the Morell-Thule server decided to<br>sponsor an event entitled The Quest For Fire.  Our guild is a fairly new<br>guild and we are trying to encourage roleplaying and events in Norrath to<br>make EverQuest as fun as possible.. The following is the tale of The Quest<br>For Fire.  I would appreciate it if you could post this on EQVault, as we<br>are planning more events in the future and we are trying to get our name out<br>there in the world.  Thanks!<br><br> The Quest For Fire<br><br>The call around Qeynos went out... "Here Ye!  Here Ye!!  The AnDarim are<br>sponsoring a guild event entitled The Quest For Fire, all levels 1 to 5<br>interested in participating, please come to the Qeynos gates around 11pm for<br>further instructions"<br><br>So, 11pm rolled around, and their I stood next to the gate in Qeynos,<br>surrounded by about 20 or so players all excited and waiting to partake in<br>this mysterious Quest For Fire...<br><br>The following we're the rules for the contest, I paired up each of the<br>participants based on level and then sent them the instructions for the<br>quest.  They had to gather 2 fire beetle eyes, 4 bat wings, 2 ruined wolf<br>skins and 1 snake skin.  Once they had gathered all the loot they had to<br>find an AnDarim guild member hiding in the Qeynos Hills.  Once they found<br>one, they had to prove they had the goods, and then they we're each given 5<br>beer to drink.  Once the alcohol was consumed by each, they were given a<br>Torch (the fire) and had to run to the Qeynos Gate to present me with it.<br><br>The winners of the Quest for Fire were:<br><br>1st place: HuneyPie and Rackal: They took home a forged bastard sword, 4pp,<br>banded bracer and raw hide sleeves<br>2nd place: ElementalMaster and Vaill: They took home 4pp, a dex ring, medium<br>PW pants and tunic<br>3rd place: Tormathacot and Tatiania: They took home 3pp and a banded bracer.<br><br>I would like to extend my congratulations to the winners and ALL the<br>participants in the event.  Fun was had by all.<br>I would also like to thank the AnDarim members who helped in the event,<br>Torynth, Druan, Droin, Talavir, Grendyn, Laythar and Athene.  They were<br>wonderful, and after the event was over we all congregated in Qeynos all had<br>a few too many beers!  The Drunken AnDarim we were!<br><br>Thanks again everyone, and stay tuned for more AnDarim events in the near<br>future!<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Lord Caleryn<br>Guildmaster of The AnDarim</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you, Caleryn!

Khana sent the following report in:<BLOCKQUOTE>I, Khana the 19th lvl warrior was on a journey from Qeynos to Highpass.  <br>Everything was going fine until I hit the wooden bridge that separates North <br>Karana from East Karana.  On this bridge was a troll.  A particularly rude <br>troll named Oothomp Boro extorting money from passers by.  He wanted 5 shiny <br>gold pieces from all that passed.  He claimed it was his bridge.  I tried to <br>give him bronze but it was no go, and the pair of wolves that he kept as <br>pets helped back him up.  I tried to find what he wanted the money for, but <br>the beast wouldn't tell me.  I snuck by him and got some friends.  With <br>help, he was conquered and his wolves fell to our blades and spells soon <br>after.  As far as loot goes, he was carrying a standard warhammer and a pair <br>of Black Iron leggings.<br><br>/ooc as my first GM event, I thought it was fun.  Problem was there was no <br>real roleplaying.  It was see monster, talk to monster, call in Level 50's <br>to nuke monster.  Ah well.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
I was recently sent an email concerning one of the most (if not the most) controversial class in EverQuest, the Rogue, but more specifically about their Pick Lock ability.  To start off with I'd like to post that letter I received:<UL><I>The rogue community may soon come to a close over a issue concerning Locked <br>Doors and Verant.<br><br>Rogues have for a long time dealt with the issue that the class was never <br>fully finished and that some skills would never be used in the game  (Locate <br>and Disarm Traps).  Verant told them it was a dead issue and the skills <br>would neither be implemented, replaced, or remove from the class as it would <br>be "to difficult".  The other list of skills for the rogue class has always <br>been questionable by those who play it.  Poison has been almost a year on <br>the dev team's desk, waiting for bugs to be fixed that had been reported <br>since it's implementation.  It was added to the list of useless skills.  <br>Today the rogue community has learned that Door Exploits are now allowed.<br><br>Pick Locks has always had a shady history with Rogues.  The lack of locked <br>doors in Ever Quest, and the doors wich were locked, but unpickable in <br>dungeons like Najena had always never made sense.  They did make the skill a <br>integral part of the Burning Rapier quest though when they demonstrated they <br>had the power to put a locked door anywhere they felt necessary.  The door <br>contained within a essential part of the Quest.<br><br>The skill package of the rogue still left much to be desired though, and <br>Verant realized this.  They promoted and sold expansion to the rogue <br>community on the fact that they had a better designed world with more locked <br>doors to be use with Lock Picks.  Now that Kunark is here though, and the <br>majority of players have bought this expansion, Verant has decided to pass a <br>ruling that effected the use of this skill, and the rogue class itself.  <br>Door Exploits are allowed, and you do not require a rogue to proceed past <br>these locked doors in Kunark.  Pick Locks has now become another skill in <br>the list of abilities for rogues that serves no specific purpose.<br><br>Gordon has stated that it is more reliable to have a rogue open the door, <br>but that it is not necessary.<br><br>It is now a acceptable practice to open these doors in Kunark with specific <br>lock pick ratings (average of a 201 which requires a minimal of 20 hours in <br>befallen of constant clicking to raise the skill.  this is not a <br>exaggeration.) with methods other than a key or set of lockpicks.  The use of <br>AoE spells, pets, and manipulation of NPCS are now all approved for use if <br>you do not feel you need a rogue.<br><br>I write this as calmly as possible, but due to Verant's lack of willingness <br>to fix this issue they have in effect killed a class that they have showed <br>their unwillingness to deal with in past issues.  I retire my rogue, and <br>step away from EQ with a sad heart knowing that I can no longer be a part of <br>this when even the creators encourage cheating.  I know I do not walk away <br>alone though.<br><br>Tarkien Motiff<br>Rake of the 52nd Dagger.<br>The Nameless</I></UL>Continuing on, I have created a new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message_flat.asp?topic=5878823&replies=0">Player View Discussion thread</a> regarding the "Lock Pick" issue.  Do you think there are enough locked doors in Kunark?  Do you think the skill is as it should be?  Or is it under-powered? And maybe most important, should something be done about the mentioned ability to use AoE spells and Pets to open these doors?<br><br>Please feel free to share your feelings and post your comments on the thread.

Gordon has been busy on the Gameplay Board as usual.  Here are the latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052131.html"><b>Music Problem</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: So, I am wondering why I can't get ANY music in Everquest at all. Now, recently, we were sent all those .Xmi files I had to sit through,]</i> <br><br>They were pretty small, it shouldn't have taken too long to download them. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: and then deleted anyways for fear of having the camping issues. Either way, I have yet to get music in the game.]</i> <br><br>You'll only get music if there is an XMI file for the zone that you are in. If you've deleted all of the XMI files I doubt you'll get any music. Now if you didn't get any music even when you had XMI files, there's probably a problem with your sound card configuration. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052141.html"><b>Illusion/Faction Issue</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why does faction(good and bad) transfer to my"true self", when I have any Illusion on? Example: I use my DE illusion when I do the stein of moggok quest in Oggok. My true self is no longer KoS there now. I use my DE and Troll illusion in SK to kill treants. My "true self" is Kos to druids and all of Qeynos now. Is it a bug or are my illusions just kinda worthless now? I would really like to hear from you on this, Abashi, if at all possible. ]</i><br><br>It's not a bug and it's always worked this way. Deed-based faction (faction based on what you have done) is attached to the character, not the race that you happen to look like at the time. The only faction that illusions can affect is that of your race. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052143.html"><b>Item Specific Issues</b></a><br>Though I appreciate everyone's concerns on some of the item-specific issues that have come up lately, some of this stuff is just the way it works. <br><br>I would like to come up with a better way to say that, but sometimes that's the simplest explanation for issues such as this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052145.html"><b>FA Quest Question</b></a><br>This is the first report I've heard along these lines. The quest components are pretty rare drops. <br><br>That said, I do believe that the quest was revamped less than 4 months ago, so your data might be a bit off.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052129.html"><b>Unblockable Spam</b></a><br>I'll talk to the guys about including that in the /ignore filter. In the mean time, please /report anyone being anti-social in that fashion and /petition to let the GMs know that you sent the report. <br><br>Though we do like to retain our customers, we'd be happy to do without those who purposely try to ruin the game for others.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052127.html"><b>Bug Report List</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: L56 Mage spell Muzzle of Mardu is bugged and can't be used by any race at all.]</i> <br><br>Not a bug. Give it to your pet. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Mage spell L56 Dyzil's Deafening Decoy have a spell that was meant to be an AE tauntspell (atleast what I heard), it ain't working, it can't taunt a mob of a L53 Airpet.]</i> <br><br>This should be pretty straight forward, I'll see if test can take a look. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Mages normal focus items don't work on Pets over L51, this is a huge bug or a secret nerf.]</i> <br><br>Neither. They just aren't implemented at this time. That's not to say that we will want to implement them though, as pets are about as powerful as we want them to be. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052100.html"><b>Suggestion for Vallon Zek</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I was wondering if the CHEST piece could be made no drop on VALLON because its the most important piece for melee types and if some naked caster pkes it off ya when at 2 bubles of health the efficiency of that char goes down alot casters got nothing to lose when they die.]</i> <br><br>We really don't have any plans of making items NODROP to eliminate them as a loot possibility on the PvP servers that allow item loot.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052095.html"><b>Undead & Nightvision</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, Why do undead not get Night vision?  Is this a bug or a feature?]</i> <br><br>Like some other things on the board today, this is just how it is. When creating the illusions we decided what benefits an illusion would have. Night vision wasn't one of them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052009.html"><b>Fun Ideas for High Keep Hold</b></a><br>Though in the original design, meta-games (games within games) were later scrapped in favor of working on other and more pressing issues. We do not have any immediate plans to revisit them at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052067.html"><b>Complement</b></a><br>I think that there's more than a few out there like you, and I appreciate the fact that you posted here on the boards. <br><br>I'm glad you are enjoying the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052068.html"><b>Team Servers/Rallos Zek & Faction</b></a><br>The teamservers have faction hits for PvP. Rallos Zek, on the other hand, does not have those faction hits. That's just how the servers are set up. <br><br>Plenty of people still engage in PvP combat despite these restrictions.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052086.html"><b>New PvP Server?</b></a><br>We bring up new servers when the population on existing servers gets to the point that a new server is needed. All three of the PvP servers are currently underutilized, leaving no reason to bring up another at this time. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Plus im sure a huge majority of people would love to start fresh and not have 1000 people higher in level.]</i> <br><br>This happens after the server has been up a few days anyway. Unless you are the one who's highest in level, there will always be people higher than you.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051942.html"><b>Inspecting Players Suggestion</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I've posted about this before, and I've also suggested maybe making right-click player inspection re-mappable to a keyboard key, but maybe the simplest way to do this would be to just make player inspection during combat not possible. Accidentally right-clicking on other players, and seeing their stuff while I'm getting wailed on is annoying. I can't be the only person who has this problem. Thanks.]</i> <br><br>Sounds simple enough. I'll ask the client programmer if he can take a look at it. No promises though.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041075.html"><b>Falling off Boats</b></a><br>Thanks for the info. Until we can get it fixed, I suggest you jump over that area with the collision problem. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050423-2.html"><b>Server Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Case in point, after 5 days hunting in Hate during normal prime time hours, little was available to hunt as the non-peak crowd from over seas had largely cleared the zone during the "day" here (late aftrnoon here). This leaves many guilds in peak time at a loss for hunting for those items specific to these types of locations.]</i> <br><br>We can't start restricting use of a server during specific times of day on the basis that other people can play when you can't. It could very well be the other way around, with non-peak players citing how peak-players kill everything in these areas. <br><br>The servers are up 24/7 excluding scheduled and emergency downtime. Nothing is on a perfect 24 hour or 12 hour spawntime, so sooner or later the critters in question will pop when virtually anyone is online.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051708.html"><b>Druid Quest Armor</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The last thread had a lot of good ideas and was completely ignored. Let's try again]</i> <br><br>This issue comes up about every two weeks as people who bring it up move on, and new people come here to the boards. I know that I've addressed it probably a few dozen times in the past 6 months. <br><br>That said, we are aware of the interest in a mid-level quest armor. We haven't ruled out the possibility of putting some in in the future, but we don't have any specific plans to do so. We recieve hundreds of requests for items, quests, and content of various types daily. We have to decide what is *needed* versus what is *wanted*. Right now there is no pressing *need* for a mid-level druid quest armor based upon the fact that there are many other items in game that druids can wear, and that provide stats and bonuses in excess to what any class-specific armor would. <br><br>Hopefully we will do it some day. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051872.html"><b>Blood Ember Armor</b></a><br>The guys have looked the issue over. The blood ember armor weight is intentional. According to the Live guys, it's due to the fact that the armor is easier to get than the other armor types in Kunark. <br><br>I've had them look at the issue twice now, so it's pretty firm at this point.</UL>

Here's the morning edition of the Gordon Infobits for your reading pleasure:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051787.html"><b>EverQuest Issues</b></a><br>I had a few comments on some of these: <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1) GM's will almost always take the side of the higher lvl player during a dispute. The high lvl players are usually friends with the GM group. They have been around the longest and have probably have even grouped with GMs.]</i> <br><br>False. Someone can be "high level" in a matter of calendar days. The GMs don't run around seeking out high level people to be their friends. The only people that the GMs really get to know are the ones who petition more than others. 90% of GM and Guide time is spent servicing 10% of the people on the server. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Abashi will only fight the fights that he can win. He will not respond to "real" problem issues.]</i> <br><br>I prefer to spend more time on issues where forward progress can be made rather than the ones that are entirely subjective in nature I'm really not here to win. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 3) Twinking will not be stopped.]</i> <br><br>True. People twink. Most people don't have a problem with it. We've tried to design the game in a fashion that the effect of twinking in minimized. The main issue left is envy, which I'm not sure if we can solve. Someone will always be able to get more things faster than someone else. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 5) There is a 'experience range' around the monster when it is slain. The closer you are to it when it dies, the more exp you get.]</i> <br><br>Though there is a range to get experience, the amount of experience you get is not scaled by distance from the creature, damage that's been done to it, or how many spells have been cast during the fight (some of the more popular myths). <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 6) Almost all of Verants statements have a hidden agenda.]</i> <br><br>Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar... - Freud <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 7) Following the path is not any less dangerous, and will not get you to your destination any sooner than running a straight line.]</i> <br><br>Maybe they are just trying to see where it goes? I usually follow the path in Nektulos. I get turned around in that zone so easily. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 9) Kiting was nerfed, but not how you was told. Way back when, Verant decided to nerf kiting (dot and run). They told us that if the monster is moving, it will not take damage by the dot at all. Only if it is stopped, then it will be harmed. This is not true. What they did, is decrease the time the dot is present.]</i> <br><br>Huh? Kiting was addressed, but not in the way that you mention here. Duration is a constant. The variable is damage per tick. If the critter is moving and chasing (but not fleeing) at the time that the damage is applied, it will take 2/3rds the damage that it normally would. At the time this change was made, all DOTs had their duration upped slightly. <br><br>We originally considered not applying any damage in the event that the creature was moving, but scrapped that idea due to public opinion.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051782.html"><b>Kunark Loot</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: You have reduced coin-loot to lower than typical levels on most mobs in Kunark as part of your effort to prop up the value of plat?]</i> <br><br>The idea was to redefine, worldwide, the definition of good coin loot. The problem is that certain static costs in game remain just that, static. <br><br>We're going to discuss the coin drop issues, and other things related to the economy (trade skill costs, component costs, etc.) in the tuning meeting next Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051818.html"><b>Level Limits</b></a><br>We really don't intend to close off areas of the game based on people being too high in level. There are a number of reasons for this, not the least of which is that some high-level areas require passage through lower level areas. <br><br>Lower Guk, for example, requires passage through upper Guk. If you are in Qeynos Hills, EverFrost and Permafrost require passage through Blackburrow. There's also the fact that we'd have a few problems coming up with an RP reason to restrict higher level people from entrance into lower level areas. <br><br>We only put the level restriction on the Planes because we wanted the items there to be a badge of honor for the person wearing them. When the plane of fear was first opened, people were taking level 1 characters up there to loot things that people in the group could not otherwise use. <br><br>This limit also let us bend some of the previous game mechanics that were required in order to insure that twinking does not have a huge impact on the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051837.html"><b>Class vs. Skill Based Systems</b></a><br>Actually I think that most people would agree that the class-based system is one of EQ's greatest strengths, even if they don't agree with the particular way we've implemented it in regards to a class or two. <br><br>Skill-based systems, in my opinion, inevitably lead to all of the characters migrating slowly to whatever combination of skills is deemed "most powerful" at the time. The only safeguard against that would be a skill-based system that doesn't let you switch to the skill-lineup du jour, but of course, then it would really be a class-based system.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050279-2.html"><b>Are Hybrid Hogging Experience?</b></a><br>Experience allocation hasn't changed, and is how it always has been, so nothing has changed. The specifics surrounding how experience is passed out within the group isn't something that we plan on releasing. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051505.html"><b>Desktop Bug Still Around?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why is it that every time I either log in or zone into Southern Karana, West Commons, or The Lost Temple of Cazic Thule I get booted back to the desktop?]</i> <br><br>I'd try deleting the XMI files for those zones. We created and distributed a bunch of them and it caused a few problems. We're working on them now.</UL>

EverLore has smacked up a new <a href="http://www.everlore.com/news/Interview_BT.asp">interview with Verant's Bill Trost</a>.  Bill, for those who don't know, is one of EverQuest's lead designers.  Unfortunately, this interview was originally done a few months ago during the second EQG, and as such the majority of the Q&A is very dated.  Here's a clip:<UL><b>Bryan Reynolds: Would you ever start taking checks, money orders, or other forms of payment other than just credit cards?</b><br><br>Bill Trost: That would be cool. I think we should. It&#8217;s not necessarily my area of expertise, but I think that would definitely be good. </UL>

Gordon has been busy on the Gameplay Board lately.  Here's all the latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051774.html"><b>Iksar Faction Issues</b></a><br>It's not a bug. Iksar have some serious faction issues.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051785.html"><b>"Gordon Caught in a Lie" Thread Deleted</b></a><br>I deleted it. <br><br>The message "quoted" two things that I never said, neither in letter nor in spirit. I figure if someone is going to have the nerve to call someone a liar, they should at least get their facts straight. Besides, I really have enough work clarifying the things that I did say, let alone the things that I don't. <br><br>Now if someone wants to ask if I said "XXXX" or request clarification when I said "XXXX", feel free. But don't come on the boards declaring as fact that I said something that I didn't, calling me a liar for it.<br>-------<br><br><i>[Quote from original post: We're still considering these issues. Though we don't want to see level 60 folk bottom feeding on dragons, we don't necessarily want to buff them all up either. We'll come up with something, but everyone will have to wait for the release of the expansion to see what that is]</i> <br><br>Actually that quote was specifically about Dragons. We have something in mind for that, and wanted to get it in at launch, but had to put it off for a while. I wouldn't be surprised if you see something happen along those lines in the near future. <br><br>As for the Planes, I believe that I said that we are sensitive to everyone's feelings concerning the planes and that we had no plans at that time to upgrade their difficulty. <br><br>That's still accurate. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: But just like the rest of your post, you leave room for error on your part]</i> <br><br>Error, changed minds, reevaluation, etc., sure. Nothing is absolute in this business except for the fact that nothing is absolute. Things change, ideas are refined, and arguments are analyzed. "should", "might", "probably", and "may" do not mean "will" and shouldn't be taken as such. <br><br>We have to be flexible to remain responsive.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051758.html"><b>Balance and Equality</b></a><br>This thread appears to be going along quite well without me, but I did want to comment on this quote. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: If a wizard and a warrior are balanced, they are both about equal in power level.]</i> <br><br>Actually, offensive power is only one component in the equation. Usefulness to a group is another, which leads to versitility. Versitility is a big one, meaning that classes that are very versitile may not be as offensively powerful or useful to the group as another class in a specific role. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051765.html"><b>Faction Messages</b></a><br>I'm not sure who you may have been speaking to or what they meant, but the information isn't correct. Faction messages are all printed, though it is certainly possible for someone to be unaware of the particular faction that an NPC is on.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051705.html"><b>More Fun Spells</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I have been thinking lately that there should be more "fun" spells in the game.. Spells that dont' neccisarily (misspelled) have a purpose in the game other than to play around with.]</i> <br><br>I do like the idea of fun spells, and would like to have more of them around. We have several in now, including a line of magician summons that are there for fun. Of course, one of the problems with fun spells is that people have an expectation that all spells should be "useful", with "useful" being defined as something that helps advancement in one form or the other. <br><br>It would be interesting to hear how many would like to see more fun spells of this nature in the game. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051678.html"><b>Favorite Class Duo</b></a><br>Though every situation is different, I've personally been fond of the Necro/Rogue combo. The necro ability to both debuff movement rates and fear lets the rogue do a heck of a lot of damage.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051492.html"><b>Reforming Guildes</b></a><br>As far as getting the guild reformed, that will only happen if the guild leader comes on and does it himself. <br><br>Once a guild is created, the person who created it has rights to the name, and can create or disband it on other servers as he sees fit. Ownership of guilds is system-wide, not server-based.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051640.html"><b>Lost a Level</b></a><br>I suppose that it might be possible that whatever problem disabled the use of spells also affected the experience attached to the corpses of anyone who died at the time. The GM Staff, however, are the ones who would determine this and decide what reimbursements if any would be awarded. <br><br>You'll really need to contact them per the Guide's advice.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051667.html"><b>Moving Characters Between Accounts</b></a><br>We've spoken about it. Moving characters between accounts just opens up too many loopholes where the ability could be used for something other than intended. Though I do indeed sympathize with those who are in this boat, there are too many ways around any verification that we could do to insure that the transfers aren't being used for illegal sales of characters. <br><br>I do apologize to those who we cannot service in this matter.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051482.html"><b>Death Penalty Comments</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I can see a fair amount, but let's face it the death penalty in this game stinks!]</i> <br><br>Drootes, if the death penalty did not hurt, it wouldn't be a penalty. If everyone was happy with it, then it wouldn't be serving it's function. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: The death penalty is completely wrong and needs to be more in line with reality.]</i> <br><br>Now *that* would be extreme :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051430.html"><b>Couple of Questions Answered</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: GM's can do an Exp res when there is a game play problem right? Well then why do you have exp loss (you still don't get all your exp, but most), you still get res effects, and you lose all your mana and most of your HP. If a GM has determined that you deserve a GM res, why not have it a full, no strings attached res?]</i> <br><br>The process that attaches the "Resurrection Effects" is on the back end of the resurrection code. At the time that the effects are applied, all it knows is that you have been resurrected, not by what spell, which is why it's attached to all resurrections. I agree that this is a bit of a pain, and I'll see if we might have another way to determine what kind of Rez has been cast. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2.) What is with all the random faction hits in the Lake of Ill Omen?]</i> <br><br>They aren't precisely random. They occur when you are on the hatelist of a creature killed by another group. Basically, it's part of the Hatelist propagation issue described here a few days ago. <br><br>For instance, you attack NPC A, who yells for help to NPC B, who yells for help to NPC C. NPCs A and B are close enough to you to chase after you, however NPC C is not. NPC C wanders around the zone and yells for help to NPCs D, E, F, and G, who are all too far away to come after you.

Part of what makes having a cleric/necro who can bind in a area close to where you are doing a dungeon raid to get a rez is to lower down time. If on PvP, you in sense want to increase down time because a few "exploiters" want to ruin the game, then you are causing more problems than you are fixing.]</i> <br><br>The challenge has always been to add PvP as a viable option without adversely affecting or trivializing the PvE (Player versus Environment) aspects of the game. That said, PvP needs to have risk associated with it. Since item loot creates a caster/melee risk disparity, and since coin-loot is only a negligible risk, and since experience loss isn't going to happen, restricting binding might might be the best way to go.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051383.html"><b>PvP Suggestion Response</b></a><br>Being very honest with you, any type of experience loss for PvP deaths is not at all likely to be put in EQ. The GM/Guide staff is already inundated with requests for customer service based upon harassment even though there is substantially little risk. The core engine of EQ cannot support the changes that would be necessary in order to implement experience-loss on PvP in an equitable manner. <br><br>That said, I do recognize the need for risk in PvP. One idea that I'm partial to is making it so that binding is *only* allowed in cities, regardless of class. That would encourage people to win battles, punish them if they lose, and be fair for both melee and casters from a PvP perspective. <br><br>Thoughts?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051108-4.html"><b>Robe of the Lost Circle</b></a><br>Scaevola certainly has my sympathies for the whole situation. <br><br>Here's what happened for those interested: <br><br>1. Scaevola fails to make the Robe of the Lost Circle. Of course, at this time, there is a chance of failure. The fact that I posted that we're removing this skill check the next time we patch items has no bearing on what is in game now. The failure isn't a bug, but rather a poor decision on the part of the quest designer. These happen from time to time.<br>2. A GM gives him a robe. This was a mistake on the part of the GM who thought that failure was a bug.<br>3. The GM later finds out it wasn't a bug and takes the robe back. This was probably also a mistake, as the GM should probably have let him keep the robe then deal with future requests for serivce along these lines by admitting that he'd made a mistake. Of course, what he wanted to avoid was a bunch of peopel deciding to go and make their robe under the mistaken impression that they'd get reimbursed if it failed. <br><br>All of that said, giving the robe back to Scaevola at this point would be a further mistake, as things are now the way they were back before the GM got involved. <br><br>I certainly apologize to Scaevola for the whole series of events.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050986.html"><b>When can I buy the expansion upgrade again?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Am I correct in that since the release of Kunark, there has been no way for someone who already owns Everquest to buy a copy without re-purchasing the entire game?]</i> <br><br>Yes, that's the case. The "Online Store" was taken down shortly after Kunark launched due to some distribution, billing, and shipping issues. We're still working on these. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Please tell me that's not the case and where I can buy the expansion.]</i> <br><br>If you need it right away, the only option currently available is purchase of the retail box, who's key you can use to upgrade your existing account. I've heard that a few retailers are offering some pretty sizable rebates to existing EQ subscribers, so you should be able to get it near the expansion-upgrade price.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051330.html"><b>Feign Death</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Today i used one of my spells that is supposed to save my life at least once in a while. I was in Karnor's catle and 4 drolvgar were pulled when i was not in a group yet. 2 died and i went oom and very low health so i feigned and checked to see if it worked. It worked both were indifferent to me.]</i> <br><br>Every experience I've had with feign death indicates that it either works, or it doesn't. This is the first I've heard of it working, the person having the item to /con each creature that was on them, then it breaking for no reason. <br><br>Possible reasons it might have happened: <br><br>1. Another mob came into range and wasn't fooled. <br>2. Perhaps hit by an AE spell? (haven't never been hit by one while feighed before, I'm not sure if this would do it.)<br>3. It's possible that the critters might get several chances to see through it if they are just standing around. I'll check into this tomorrow.<br>4. Some bug? <br>1-3 would not be bugs if it is one of those that was happening. <br><br>Please remember that creatures do not get a direct save versus feign. If you get a "fallen to the ground" message, none of them are fooled. If you do not get that message, you have then fooled them subject to a low percentage chance of the creature making it's intelligence check. <br><br>You do, however, get an indication if a creature isn't fooled, it keeps beating on you.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048669-2.html"><b>Spawn Rate Question</b></a><br>If that's indeed what has to be done, it does sound a bit out-of-whack.

They return 100% of the experience lost. They used to be constrained, not by the 49th cleric rez, but by the XP modifier for the zone. All rez's were constrained by this. <br><br>It was corrected a few months ago. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2- The 49th level cleric spell has a 2 hour time limit on xp return.]</i> <br><br>All rez's have this two hour limit, not just the 49th cleric rez. We're currently looking into the possibility of having the GM Rez excluded from this time limit, but it's difficult, so I don't have an ETA. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Also, when you make a petition and log out, that petition is cleared.]</i><br> <br>No, it's not.

So we invite every brave adventurer who is willing to join our peaceful party. <br><br>The party will start at 8 a.m. (PST) at the wizard gate near Felwithe. You will find there a exquisite meal to everyone of you and beside this we planned for the young adventurers (level 1-9) of you a special challenge to award the brave warrior who knows Faydwer best.<br><br>We hope to have a lot of guests who will celebrate the first birthday of these two guilds with us.<br><br><br>( Important: Because both guilds are German speaking only guilds we decide to use this language mainly on this event. This makes it easier for some of our members who are not too good in English. But of course we have some members who have no problems with the English language.

The challenge is planned in German but we translate it in English as well if demanded so that every one has the possibility to take action in it.

Felwan Silverblade informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail,<br><br>Last night, I was strolling around west commons when I heard a shout from a<br>man named Jeroth asking if any warriors, paladins, or shadowknights were up<br>to a challenge, a test of honor.  Well, feeling that if I didn't respond my<br>honor would be in question, I answered his request and was then told that I<br>was the one who would face the challenge.  I met Jeroth in the corner of<br>commons near the shadowmen camp and he proceeded to tell me what was in<br>store.  I found out that I was to face his 3 brothers, one at a time, in a<br>battle to the death.  Once I killed the first brother, I was to return the<br>amulet wore around his neck back to Jeroth and would then receive my clue as<br>to the location of the next brother.  Also, I was able to choose a team of<br>companions to aid my in my fight.  Well, I choose friends that were near,<br>Carbo, Stratten, Taycie, Kaetlyn, and Canalon agreed to help me and we were<br>off to the desert of North Ro to kill the first brother.  After that fight,<br>we returned and were told to meet the next in Kithicor, and after that<br>battle, my final brother to meet was in lava storm.<br><br>The first brother's name was Drewyn Wyndsteel and he was a warrior as<br>myself.  The second brother was a monk by the name of Zev Thunderfis.  The<br>third and final brother was an evil dark elf shadowknight by the name of<br>Dalesk V'Syrn.  All three were difficult competitors, but all three died by<br>the end of my blades.  Upon returning to Jeroth after the third brother, I<br>was told I would face my final confrontation in the Arena in West Freeport<br>and this battle was to be me alone.  Well, we all assembled in Freeport and<br>after some problems with some over zealous guards, I was in the arena ready<br>to face my final battle.  My opponent was the Spirit of Honor, and I was no<br>match for his obvious powers.  I knew my doom was pending, so I saluted the<br>Spirit before he made the final blow, and was told to STOP fighting.  He<br>congratulated me for passing all the trials and two more spirits showed up,<br>the Spirit of Fury and the Spirit of Heart.  I was congratulated by all<br>three spirits, and was then awarded a blade, the Blade of Champions.  I<br>vowed to do my best to uphold the name of this mighty blade and thanked the<br>Spirits who had gathered to test me.<br><br>I am honored that I was chosen to take place in this test, and I am<br>greateful for all those that helped.  I wanted to take a moment to thank<br>everyone who followed me around to all the different spots and congratulated<br>me in the end.

Here are more excerpts and quotes written by Gordon Wrinn and found on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051376.html"><b>TestEverQuest.exe</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: What gives? Was this a mistake during the recent client upgrade I think I heard about? Ive never had access to the test server before, and I dont think I do now, so where in heck did the shortcut (and corresponding executable) come from?]</i> <br><br>"Testeverquest.exe" is the patch program and loader that will give you access to the test server. The shortcut has probably been on your desktop all along, or, perhaps someone else on your system put it up there for you. <br><br>As for logging in, the entire interface is the same except for the server-selection screen, which will only list the Test server as a valid server. I would imagine that if you had problems logging in, though I'm not sure at what point you had those problems, it may be because the Test server goes up and down frequently to put in the newest changes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051372.html"><b>Mother of All Whines</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: heh, verants been aware of the alchemy problem since last year and they STILL havent touched it]</i> <br><br>Er, after we (finally) relized that there was a problem training the skill, alchemy as a whole was revamped. In addition, prices are being lowered. The changes that didn't go in in the last item patch will go in in the next. <br><br>All of this was "touched" since last year.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051362.html"><b>Procs on RoK Stuff</b></a><br>All those who can wield the sword are melee types. The addition of the mace allowed some other classes, not melee in nature, to obtain and use an item with a similar effect. The SSoY proc's sooner because it is only for classes that deal their damage primarily with weapons. <br><br>There is also the matter of the higher ratio as someone else here mentioned.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051366.html"><b>Rogue's Hide/Sneak Messed Up?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I play a rogue and a necro why is it that when my rogue hides and camp he is visible when i log back on but this doesnt happen to my necro invis spell? when my rogue zones he is not hidden but by necro is invis?]</i> <br><br>Much like illusions, "sneak" will not cross a zone border. Camping is equivalent to a zone border from a funcationality standpoint, which is why the same behavior is observed. It's not a bug, but rather the way it works. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: when I hide next to a Bard in my group his song brakes my hide... but the caster siting next to him is still invis?...]</i> <br><br>For this issue, we're looking into changing hot it works. This also goes for the similar issues with caster invis.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051370.html"><b>Bugs on the Board</b></a><br>Hello all, <br><br>Every once in a while someone will post all of the reproduction steps necessary for our test department to investigate an exploitable bug, and "bump" the post in hopes of it getting acknowledged. <br><br>Though I do appreciate the fact that you want to bring the issue to our attention, and I do forward the issues to the test team, I generally won't reply to a report of that nature here on the boards as I don't want to call the attention to it, thus spreading the information across the net. <br><br>I would ask that if you have something that is exploitable, meaning that it can be used to harm other players or allow unreasonable gains for the user, please email it to <a href="mailto:eqtesting@verant.com">eqtesting@verant.com</a>, rather than posting it here on the boards.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051154.html"><b>Concordance Still Having Trouble?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Although the leggings did combine once to make a rune, 3 attempts failed to combine to make anything. Losing your quill is a bummer not say the trouble of having to go find a burned out lightstone.]</i> <br><br>Hmmm, I haven't heard of any intermittent problems in this regard. If a recipe works once, and does not check a skill, it should always work. The caveat here is that it is assumed that there isn't another item, with the same name, in game, that isn't accounted for in our tables. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: I can't help but think it is some perverse design built into the game that when I wanted a GLS, all I ever saw were burned out ones. Now when I need a burned out lightstone all I ever get are GLS's.]</i> <br><br>We have Murphy on retainer as a consultant. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: I have noticed that the ring-mail components for making Study runes (beza) are more expensive then those required to make Expert runes (beza). Was this intentional? You can buy a ringmail braclet from a merchant for 5pp. I try to aquire my own components when possible. Sometimes this is very boring as I am hunting and killing stuff that is 20 levels lower then I am, but that is the way of it. When I have the extra cash I buy from players, and if the pickings are slim and I am in a hurry I buy from the merchants.]</i> <br><br>It's not by value as much as it is by difficulty to obtain the item. In this case, I believe the ringmail pieces all have the same chances to drop as any other piece, so the real "value" from a game-mechanics standpoint is equal. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051114.html"><b>No Rogue Trainers in Evil Kunark Outpost	</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone else find it odd that there are no rogue trainers or quest givers in the dark elf outpost? The Hall of the Ebon Mask should have every reason to want to set up station there. Besides, it gets damned annoying having to travel all the way back to Neriak from Overthere whenever I level. :P]</i> <br><br>Bankers and guildmasters on the island is really an artifact from the beta period, when testers on Kunark couldn't leave those lands. When it went live, we basically forgot to remove them. The missing guildmasters are ones that were mistakingly neglected when setting up the outpost. In this case, we've decided not to remove them. <br><br>The point that I'm getting to here is that Kunark was not meant to be a self-contained environment that noone would ever leave. At present, we're not planning on adding the missing guildmasters. As I mentioned a few months ago, deciding that we aren't going to "nerf" something doesn't mean that we will be elevating everything else to the same level. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051088.html"><b>The Hole</b></a><br>The Hole is looking good. It's being populated and itemized right now. We'll be putting it up on the Test server when we are ready for tuning. <br><br>As for that 49th Paladin spell, I've asked for a progress update. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051103.html"><b>Being Happy</b></a><br>Thanks for your input JasTiger. I appreciate your opinion, and understand what you are trying to get at. But please understand that there is no universal definition of "happy". Things that might make one person happy might upset 100 others. On virtually any subject, you can find people who will agree or disagree. <br><br>Our goal is to keep as many people as possible as "happy" as possible for as long as possible. Just as there are people who joined the game and decided that they didn't like it in a few weeks, there are others who've been playing since it was released. Trust me that if there was a way that we could insure 100% of the people would be pleased, within the guidelines of our goal, we'd take that course.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051097.html"><b>Kunark Loot</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The drops in Kunark of cash are pathetic, every decent item costs THOUSANDS of plat on Veeshan, and there is NO way to get this kind of money together after nerfing the dwarfs, except by camping rare spawns or HGs, and competeing w lvl 30 characters for kills. I have hunted blue con mobs in almost every outdoor kunark zone and they all drop liek 3sp and a TON of cp drops, WTF is that when you kill 10 lvl 40 mobs and get 11cp a piece?]</i> <br><br>It is true that cash drops in general are getting lower. In addition to the Kunark zones all being set up to drop less cash, other zones are likewise being modified. "Cash Cows", such as the dwarves in Butcherblock that used to drop an average of 27pp every six minutes, are being identified and adjusted. <br><br>Good items cost "thousands of plat" because of the amount of excess cash in the world. As the money sinks take their toll, the price of the items will drop to a level of equilibrium with the current cash drops. It shows that money is becoming more valuable.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051087.html"><b>Stance Against Responding to Class-Envy Posts</b></a><br>Thanks for your comments MrDete. Your advice is well-received. Please also understand though that everyone can come up with well-grounded issues for each class, which they honestly feel is a deal-breaker. The downside of this is if we could wave our hands and resolve all of the issues raised, the resolution of those issues would create other issues that other people would likewise feel need to be resolved. <br><br>Suppose for an instant that class A feels that they are less powerful than class B. Class B might at the same time feel that they are less powerful than class C. The process of elevating class A, in a manner that they feel would "balance" them with Class B would often leave Class B feeling that they are overpowered by A and C. <br><br>This process is played out over and over here on the boards, and will probably be a source of debate for years to come. Often the best course of action is not to engage in discussions where we are faced with the unenviable task of repetitively telling players that their specific concerns are not something that we consider to be an issue. It just creates bad feelings. <br><br>Indeed, you are our customer, and your business is very important to us, but to no greater or lesser extent than the business of everyone else playing the game. We'd really *like* to be able to make each person or group feel that they are more important than all of the others, and our marks in customer service would probably improve if we could. However, in our business, the level of attention or service given to one customer affects that given to all of the others. <br><br>It's a fine line. We do the best that we can and constantly strive for improvement. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050895.html"><b>Skyfires & Coin Looting</b></a><br>As I commented in another thread today, coin loot is indeed lighter for many areas of the game. Skyfire included. <br><br>In other zones, the "big" outdoor critters are an exception to other things in the zone, allowing for more loot to be handed out since there are less of them to go around. However in Skyfire, *everything* is pretty nasty, with those encounters being the rule rather than the exception. Many groups can hunt there nonstop and never run out of things to kill. Given that, they just can't drop the 10-30pp per kill of other encounters. <br><br>As for the XP, the mobs in Skyfire give more experience than mobs of a relative level in any other outdoor zone in the world.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050902.html"><b>What about Magician's Summoned Bags?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I KNOW this issue has come up a million and one times, but it just really irks me that this awesome item is hindered by the no-rent rules, thus making them risky to use. Can you fix it where the items placed in our summoned bags will transfer to the next available slot in the individual's inventory when we log or go link-dead and cannot make it back in time?]</i> <br><br>Those bags reduce the weight of anything carried within to zero, therefore there must be some downside to them or special bags dropped as loot really lose value. <br><br>We have considered putting a warning up in the event that someone tries to camp while they have loot in a summoned bag, but are having trouble coming up with a solution that would fit linkdeath loss. We didn't used to make norent items disappear on linkdeath, but many people then would go linkdead as the preferred method of leaving the game for the purpose of saving the bags. Also, once a character is out of the world, we don't maintain a record of them to allow removal of the bags after, for instance, an hour. <br><br>As far as moving the items out of the bags, that would present some major problems in the event that inventory is full. <br><br>Given these issues, the chance of losing the items on linkdeath will probably remain one of the risks of using the summoned bags.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051065.html"><b>Clarity Dwarf Key Binding Crushbone </b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Plarinum caster nerfing 7/14 DVinn issue PvP SMR banning. Rangers xp res CShome fall for 10K? Wizards superior heal fishing Felwithe Guides linkdead! <br><br>Smedley Fiery Avenger patch virus ganker Trakanon ShowEQ...camping KSers guildmate Neriak breaking. Strategy guide bards tumpy tonic Anitonica trade window post-50. <br><br>Hotkey NECROMANCERS coin-only corpse Bristlebane lizardmen Loviane speff.dat /guildsay boats train!]</i><br><br>I think that it's fair to say that we have no official stance on this issue :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050837.html"><b>Make the Sense Spells Make Sense</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyway, I have noticed that no one really uses these spells very much. The reason for this is because with all the Necro's, Mages, and Enchanters around, you can't really get any use out of this. What would be nice is that instead of the current way that these spells work.. would be if they would work somewhat like Tracking does, bringing up all of the mobs in a certian radius, of the type mentioned.]</i> <br><br>Though I appreciate your concerns and suggestions concerning the "sense" series, we wouldn't want to dilute tracking by extended "undead tracking" or "summoned tracking" to other classes. I know that it's been suggested before that we shouldn't include pets as a valid target of a "sense" spell. Perhaps that might be something I could pursue. I'll check into it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/047608-2.html"><b>Changes to PoF</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi - You specifically stated that no changes would be made to the planes to make them harder (except for possible pathing changes). These changes are horrendous and now hate is a CAKEWALK compared to Fear. Fear is *impossible* now unless you get into the plane after the server is down, gather on the north wall, and have it repopped while you're in there]</i> <br><br>Though I can't comment on any of the specific changes that you've outlined in this post, as I cannot find any indication that any change was made other than replacing some critters with fright fingers, I don't recall saying that the Planes wouldn't be changed. <br><br>Any zone can change, be retuned, etc. It's a normal part of EQ, and is not something that we would announce in this case.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050690.html"><b>Posion Update</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Any eta on poison? probably not, you're busy fixin the iksar armor quests, or alchemy, or somethin else. well, thanks anyway.]</i> <br><br>Actually I responded to this question as well as I could last week, so you aren't being ignored :)<br><br>We're still looking good for the end of this month. One of the designers is working on it daily, and sending regular status reports. It looks like it's going to be pretty cool when it's all worked out.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050700.html"><b>How Could it Happen?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, you said it wouldnt happen...How foolish I was to believe you Gordon]</i> <br><br>Moonie, <br><br>Though I understand your ire, I do want to point out a couple sections of my post which you quoted: <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: One thing to keep in mind is that we certainly don't enter into situations where we have to do this knowingly. It's a decision that's made after we've had time to evaluate items/skills/spells etc., and have discovered some detrimental affect to gameplay or the pace of the game. So I can't promise you that it won't happen.]</i> <br><br>Here I said that I couldn't promise that there wouldn't be mistakes that needed correction. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: After running EQ for over a year now, we have a much better idea about how all of this works, and as such situations such as these should be much more infrequent than they were before.]</i> <br><br>Here I indicate that there are situations where it might happen, but that they should be much more infrequent than they were before. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Hopefully we can catch any typos soon enough that replacing the existing items retroactively won't be taken as a "nerf".]</i> <br><br>Here I indicate that retroactive changes might be necessary and that we hoped to catch them quickly. <br><br>Your post indicates that you are upset because you were promised something and didn't get it. My post which you copied shows that no promises were made, that there would probably be a few mistakes, and that we'd move quickly to fix them. <br><br>I am indeed very sorry that you are upset, and do wish that there was something I could say to alleviate your feelings. We did indeed make some mistakes regarding Kunark loot, despite previous efforts. I do however believe that those mistakes were fewer in number than at EQ's release, and that we are moving along quite well in repairing them. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050796.html"><b>Spawning Under the World</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: It was proven that the spawn was spawing under the world all of that time]</i><br> <br>Interesting. I'll have the test department check it out. Thanks for the info.</UL>

A new <a href="http://www.gamersfocus.com/reviews/kunark/review.html">review of Kunark</a> has been posted by Gamers Focus.  Overall Kunark gets a 8/10 rating from them.  Here is the traditional clip:<UL>There are so many positive things about Kunark that I want to reveal to you that I feel I must get a few problems off my chest before I continue, so as not to spoil the rest. First, Kunark is currently a bit expensive. The online store that was to allow players already subscribed to buy the update is, at present, not available. This forces long time customers to go and buy the entire game all over again in the form of the new EQ+RoK pack. Also, Verant has again subscribed to the "release now, patch later" pattern of game development, thus leaving a number of known bugs in Kunark at release. These bugs consist of items not appearing as they should (The Axe of the Iron Back appearing as a two handed sword, for example), unique monsters dropping nothing but small coins (much to the disappointment of the people who banded together to destroy them), and creatures disappearing from view for no apparent reason. Some of these bugs appear to be fixed, but it is my opinion that they should never have been there in the first place. </UL>

From Catalyst:<BLOCKQUOTE>We've posted a new issue of <A href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">Ask Milo</a> here on Everlore. This week Milo covers a wide variety of topics such as Laissez-faire capitalism, The ethical issues which accompany cloning, and of course The 2nd law of thermodynamics. Oh, he also talks about 3D modeling and EQ stuff too, but you're probably not interested in that... Here's a snip from the page.    <Blockquote>    1) When you are about to start on a model, what do you begin with ? The largest part of the body ? Or perhaps the left foremost     finger that have a spot on it ?<P>     2) What is - in your opinion - most important part in modeling a figure that will be animated versus one that will not be animated     (ie. like a human vs. a rock) ?    </blockquote></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

We have fought hard long<br>battles together my friend, we have been mocked by many and hunted by more.<br>Alas though, our time tis finally at hand. A letter lost ago by an old<br>mutual friend was found the other day, in it contained what we have long<br>searched for. The ressurection of our God of Darkness Obsidian will finally<br>come to pass.<br><br>The time is ripe, Good is weak all across Norrath, we all have sensed it for<br>some time now. Guilds are fractured and in chaos and otherwise busy with<br>other tasks. There is no other time better than now, we must strike and<br>quickly. I have sent scouts ahead with the information needed, meet up with<br>them at our hidden outpost in Toxxulia. Two other places must be secure but<br>I have sent couriers to our other generals to take care of them. I will also<br>send ambassadors to our fellow brothers in darkness who wish to see the<br>Light and Good of Norrath smashed, we may need reinforcements if any of our<br>enemies my get wind of this. The day of June 16th will be one never<br>forgotten. The day our Lord Obsidian returns, the day fire and darkness<br>engulfs Norrath and Obsidan stands victorious."<br><br>Hail Obsidian!<br>Lord Edwrin</i></UL><br><br>..As you can read this is dire news indeed. Even now I know I am being<br>followed but few help me in fear of retaliation. So I post this letter to<br>all Guilds of Light and Hope, you must stop this from happening.<br><br>Ranger of the Karana<br>Activius Bowsinger<br><br>OOC-We at the Brothers of Obsidian wish to keep roleplaying strong on our<br>server, and to this end we as the villans are starting a server wide RP<br>event.

EQ Rants sends word that they've kicked up a brand new <a href="http://eqrants.net/abashi.htm">Q&A with Verant's Gordon Wrinn</a>.  Here's a clip from this amusing interview:<UL><b>*Some people are under the impression that yourself, and Verant employees in general, are evil and perhaps demons from hell. Could you please clear up this mess. Are you indeed a demon from hell and, to your knowledge, does Verant actually employ any of hells minions? Or is that just a Microsoft thing? </b><br>  <br><i>*looks over his shoulder* <br>  <br>I'm sorry, but an NDA I signed shortly after being summoned...er...I mean hired... prevents me from answering. <br>  <br>Seriously though, we are sincerely aiming to please the largest percentage of our playerbase possible by keeping the game fun and interesting for them.  Though it may appear to some that our intentions are "evil", it wouldn't make much sense for us as a company to purposely alienate our customers.  The numbers, particularly the ones that show EQ's ability to retain subscribers, and the ones that show EQ's subscribers gladly recommending the game to others, clearly show that we must be doing *something* right. People may disagree on exactly what that *something* is, and most would agree that EQ isn't perfect, but in the end, the people are here, play the game nearly every day, and enjoy the heck out of it.</i></UL>Check out the link above for the rest!
