The following word was sent in by Cyane:<BLOCKQUOTE>Trakanon Slain on Rallos Zek<br><br>The mighty army of The Sabbat marched through the ancient halls of Old Sebilis<br>on Saturday.  The dragons's guards were brutally stripped from his side, one<br>by one, until he was left all alone in his lair.  We felt the ancient dragon<br>tremble with fear as we prepared for his death. Alas the charge was called too<br>early and our army fell, our spirits torn from our body, our corpses lay at<br>his feet.  <br><br>A team of High Priests were sent to aid us.  Together they invoked the magic<br>of Brell to summon our life back into the bodies, so that we may once again<br>have the chance to slay the beast. This time our vengence was fierce the army<br>burned with an inner fire.  Trakanon had summoned for more guards but we were<br>unstoppable and we cut through them once more.  Then we charged the sea<br>colored dragon. Much to my surprise, as I sliced and stabbed at his scales, he<br>was falling fast.  His claws could not penetrate my armor and my body rejected<br>his deadly breath.  When he fell I laugh at the fallen dragon, and as he<br>sighed his last breath, one of the bards said he cursed us.  After this a<br>rogue was sent to scout his lair for treasure and came back with three ancient<br>wyrm teeth, a shimmering golden breast plate and a luminous emerald breast<br>plate.<br><br>/ooc The army of the Sabbat has slain Trakanon after two attempts on Saturday,<br>the second attempt went much more smoothly then the first.  When we fell there<br>was much rejoicing because this is the first slaying of trakanon on RZ.  The<br>loot was three teeth, a deepwater breast plate which went to Abashail Firesoul<br>and an elder spiritists breast plate which went to Adell Firespirit.  Thanks<br>goes to Adell, Ssok, Lugoj, Reefman, and Andysolo for leading the raid!<br><br>Cyane Trueblade<br>56th Myrmidon<br>Destroyers of the Faith<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/Trak1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/Trak2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/Trak3.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/Trak4.jpg">Screenshot #4</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/Trak5.jpg">Screenshot #5</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/Trak6.jpg">Screenshot #6</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Here's this evening's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016883.html"><b>Class Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When you were designing EQ (or whoever did), did you expect such a massive issue with class balance?]</i></font> <br><br>Though I wasn't here for initial design, the others here who were did indeed expect it. They are all mudders and are familiar with the amount of class-balance complaints that take place on even a small MUD. The problem is that while people can agree that classes need strengths and weaknesses, they disagree on the implementation of the weaknesses. <br><br>I personally like class-based systems better than skillbased systems that allow everyone to do anything, as people eventually migrate to whatever skill combo is deemed most powerful at the time. At the same time, I expect that disagreements regarding strengths and weaknesses will be there as long as class-based systems are. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016865.html"><b>LFT Flag</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: LFT (Looking for Teleport)?<br><br>This may have been mentioned before, but what are the odds of getting a flag like this added to the game? ]</i></font><br><br>People who can teleport ususally aren't out there looking for people who need teleports. Those people are the ones who are looking for people to teleport them. <br><br>In the case that a wizard or druid is actually looking to teleport people, all they have to do is turn off anonymous.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016904.html"><b>Paladin Reward</b></a><br>I imagine such a thing, if opened to members of a class in general, would be followed by requests for similar things to be opened to other classes. <br><br>As it is, titles (which is the closest thing that to which can compare what you are suggesting) are only awarded as part of dynamic quests or events.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016841.html"><b>"I know about changes to fleeing, what about aggro? "</b></a><br>We haven't made any changes to the way aggression works on a global basis. There's a chance that some individual NPCs have been modified (as NPCs are constantly being tweaked), but I believe the ****atrices have always been aggressive.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016829.html"><b>Religion-Changing Quests</b></a><br>There are certain choices that are made by characters in the begining that cannot be changed. Race, class, and deity are among these per the original design. They are used to determine the faction that your character will be a part of, and that faction cannot be changed one your character has entered the world. <br><br>I suppose it could be looked at as either a techical or an RP reason. Essentially, the original design decision was one of RP, and due to that decision, changing of religion was not made technically feasible.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016828.html"><b>"Have crits been adjusted?" </b></a><br>No, they have not been adjusted. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016802.html"><b>Mobs Fleeing</b></a><br>I haven't heard of this before. MOBs have been fleeing for some time, they just recently became more cowardly over all. I would imagine that if what you are suggesting happens, then it would have been happening before, if perhaps under more limiting circumstances. <br><br>Do you have a set of steps that can be completed to reproduce this bug? If so, I'd email them to eqtesting@verant.com.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016807.html"><b>Premium Servers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Melee binding?<br>No xp loss in dying? or maybe finally fixing the hell levels?<br>Soloing for all?<br>More item drops?<br>Fixing classes if the customers complain?<br>More Quests?]</i></font> <br><br>I think that you might have the wrong idea. The game would still be EverQuest. We're not talking about making a server where the mechanics of the game are different. <br><br>We're talking about making a server with a population cap and with a better ratio of dedicated customer-service people. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Each of us has the right to "Premium" customer service.]</i></font> <br><br>I posted yesterday about the concept of "premium". It just means better than average for the rest of the game. Whatever adjective you want to apply to existing customer service, premium just indicates better than that. If our current service is "premium", then the suggested server platform might be "super-premium".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016824.html"><b>The Impossible Quest</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Can we get a quest to convert agnostics, please?]</i></font> <br><br>No. Just like race or class, deity selection has advantages and disadvantages associated with it. Players have to live with whatever choices they make in this area.<br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Had the down-side been KNOWN when the characters were originated, an informed choice balancing the pros and cons of each could have been made. ]</i></font><br><br>Certain things are ment to be experienced after the choice is made. The first people playing the game or entering a new area do not know how their selections will affect what they can do. Not everything is expected to be known in the begining by the people making the decisions.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016756.html"><b>Woe Proc Broken</b></a><br>Thanks for the note, I'll mention it to the Live team. Once it is fixed, you'll have to trade yours out with a GM.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016471.html"><b>Haste and Monk's Robes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: my question is about the effect this has on the Robe of the Whistling Fists... which previously used to max out a Monks haste cap with any haste item... but now WONT EVEN COME CLOSE TO MAX HASTE even with the BEST HASTE ITEM POSSIBLE.]</i></font> <br><br>The fact that this robe plus any haste item hit the max was a bug, as we've already mentioned. It of course isn't going to hit that max now. You might consider trying to get a better haste item. Monks really weren't intended to hit the max haste cap solo. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: when you developed this item for monks and tested it and deemed it was EXACTLY what you wanted for monks... you were basically testing a Monk with it and a haste item at MAX HASTE...]</i></font> <br><br>You're assuming that we took an item with a known effect, put it on a character that has known attributes, in concert with another item with a known effect. It's not necessary to test an item in that fashion, excluding the existance of the haste bug. <br><br>The robe has X haste, another haste item has Y haste. The designer looked at X+Y and saw it as reasonable. It is. X+Y is the value you are getting now. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017022.html"><b>New Encryption = New Lag? </b></a><br>While I can't go into the specifics regarding our packaging of data, everything that we're doing in data transmission encoding has a negligible effect on system-load. <br><br>The difference in system-load last week versus this week is essentially zero.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017017.html"><b>Buff Limit</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You used to be immune, but I think they changed it to put a stop to that.]</i></font> <br><br>Indeed we did :)  What surprised me is that some even considered this change a nerf. They didn't believe that immunity after 15 buffs wasn't intended.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016977.html"><b>More, More, More!</b></a><br>Because then we'd be throwing around changes just for the sake of doing so, regardless of its impact upon the game. Were we to do all of this, would the number of complaints change, or would they just change but be as frequent in number? <br><br>For example: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Warriors get all of the good skills at a low lvl they need more skills at high lvls]</i></font> <br><br>I can see all of the other melee classes having a problem with this. I can see them saying, "Warriors were already better, now they are even moreso". This means, according to the "please everyone" philosophy, that we'd have to increase everyone's skills. Of course, then everything would get much easier, and we'd have to increase the NPCs abilities as well, leaving us right back where we are now. <br><br>--- <br><br>There's a counter like that to each of your suggestions, which is why these class-issues are so difficult in nature.</UL>

Gordon spoke in two threads dealing with the hottest topic in EQ right now, the Premium Server debate.  The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016659.html">first thread contains Gordon's response</a> to a player's claim that Verant already promised server caps for regular servers:<UL>First you said 1200 people tops.<br><br>Then you said 1500 people was the limit.<br><br>Last time you promised us 1800 people was the limit per server.<br><br>Now it's "$49.95 a month for a "premium service" to do what you have repeatedly promised and yet continously fail to provide?<br><br>Does the term fraud mean anything to you people?<br><br><b><I>We've always said that we wouldn't place population caps on the servers, due to difficulties keeping friends together and bad blood when people login to play their level 48 character and are met with "Server is full, try again later". The numbers you mentioned were targets, and targets are subject to change. The 1200 number may have been mentioned in beta, but EQ launched with more and larger zones than were planned. <br><br>The proposal up for consideration now is a server where we would place a hard cap of some kind, and guarantee that cap, rather than working towards a target. </I></b></UL>The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016667.html">second post focuses on the customer service angle: <UL><i>Until the point that some game</a> manages to have a dedicated CS person for every person playing at peak, CS always has the potential to get better in terms of response times. "Premium" is just a way of saying "better than average". If everyone gets "premium service", then that *becomes* the average. <br><br>The theoretical game above that provides a CS person for everyone playing provides each person service that is *average* for that game. They could still offer a *premium* level where they provide 2 dedicated CS people for every person playing. </I></UL>I'd again like to remind everyone of the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=6944803&start=6944803#6944803"><b>Player View Discussion Thread</b></a> raging on about this very topic.

Gordon was up late again and wrote the following posts found on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016683.html"><b>Announced Nerf?</b></a><br>I'll give you the benefit of the doubt for your last sentence and remind you that flames, including telling people (including us collectively) off is not permitted on these boards. <br><br>No, drop rates of items in the Planes were not reduced in this patch. <br><br>I'll add "Drop-rates in the planes" to the list of things that are assumed "nerfed" after every patch. It's been suggested that this was done for the past 3 patches. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012921.html"><b>Class Envy vs Legitimate Complaint </b></a><br>First, let me say that all complaints are legitimate, at least to the person making the complaint. I seriously doubt that many people come here and ask for things that they *know* are out of line, at least I hope that it wouldn't be the case. <br><br>Now, legitimate to the poster, and good for the game as a whole is a decision that we have to make. As much as I'd like to say, "No more class-envy posts..." and delete them when they come up, I think that it would be taken to mean that people wouldn't be allowed to voice their concerns, which certainly isn't the policy that we'd want to implement. <br><br>What it comes down to is that we've implemented a class-based system, and said that we're "ok" with the fact that some classes can do things that others can't. We're not just "ok" with it turning out this way, but specifically designed it so that it would be the case. I think it's a matter of trying to get buy-in from everyone (an impossible thing to do) on where exactly those strengths and weaknesses lie. Generally, people want their strengths to be "major" and their weaknesses to be inconsequential. The problem is that a weakness that is inconsequential is not *really* a weakness. <br><br>The bottom line is that yes, I see the difference between legitimate complaints and class-envy posts, but sometimes even legitimate complaints are over issues that are we consider to be working properly. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016521.html"><b>Famous People Playing EQ</b></a><br>I posed a question a while back along these lines and got a few emails. As it is, you are correct that we can't really talk about any of this. I imagine they like EQ for a the chance to go out and socialize to some extent as just "one of the guys". <br><br>Who knows, that new guy you grouped with last week might actually be someone famous :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016554.html"><b>Agnostic Warriors</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Agnostic warriors to be 2nd class now ]</i></font><br><br>Assuming for a moment that you are correct about the smithed armor being the best in the game, it would then be true that agnostic warriors would be second-class. That would be one of the downsides of being agnositc. <br><br>That said, warriors aren't a class that gets turned away from groups so I don't think that you'll have a problem, particularly if you've taken the time to cultivate the friendships that are necessary for one of your class in game. If people like *you*, they will let you in their group regardless of your equipment or what they think of your class.</UL>

Gordon created yet another new <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016604.html">thread dealing with the Mark of Karn issue</a>.  Here's the new post:<UL><i>Since we have a patch scheduled for early next week, we had a special meeting to determine what we should do with this spell. Two options were determined:<br><br>Option #1: We can leave the spell as it is now, with 6pts/hit HP-return and a 5 minute recast time.<br><br>-or-<br><br>Option #2: We can reduce the recast time to around 5 seconds, make it so that HP is only returned when the target is hit with something in your primary weapons slot, and scale the HP return based upon the delay of the weapon (1pt return per 7 delay). <br><br>Questions or thoughts? Please note that these are the two available options, so please confine your responses to those related to these options for maximum effect :)<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

As many of you know, Gordon posted a few thoughts this evening on the idea of "Premium Servers."  After receiving a tip from Dariarn I quickly entered EQ to discover a new in-game poll asking and I quote:<BLOCKQUOTE><I><b>Would you pay $49.95 for a private server that offered premium customer service?</b></I></BLOCKQUOTE>For those who haven't yet read Gordon's thoughts on this I have included the following quote:<UL><i>Anyway, we're just crunching some numbers based on multiple requests along those lines that have been posted here on the boards and sent through email. We haven't yet defined what exactly "Premium CS" means, but if the idea looks promising, we'd certainly define it before launching any servers of this type. Just as a note, the existence of any premium servers would not detract from the service provided on the standard servers. <br><br>I also noticed that many people are getting hung up on the concept of "premium". If you look at service industries, you'll see many that offer premium service of one kind or another. You can check out the standard vs. premium pricing tiers at many technology companies out there. This is not something unusual in the technology industry, just a new concept for online games.</I></UL>It's an interesting idea, no question about it, but on the other hand some would argue that this would be what people are paying for in the first place.    <br><br>I have created a new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=6944803&start=6944803#6944803"><b>Player View Discussion Thread</b></a> for everyone to share their thoughts and opinions about this sudden possibility.

One of the most philosophical questions one can ask, at least in Norrath, was raised by Gordon Wrinn in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016495.html">following thread</a>:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>I noticed a number of people here talking about the way that creatures decide to flee, referring to a change that went in with the last patch. After speaking with the programmer responsible for AI among other things, it's apparent that there was a change made while optimizing code that caused an "unintended fix" to the AI. Though no one sat down and said, "I'm going to make creatures flee more", that's the result.<br><br>Without going too far into specifics and formulae regarding the decision to flee, there are several "components" that NPCs use to determine how brave they are. One of the common ones that everyone knows about is the interrelation of hitpoints and level with the attacker. One of the other less-known components was using some uninitialized memory (memory space allocated to a variable that hasn't yet been 'set' to anything, and usually contains garbage) that had the effect of making NPCs much more brave than they should have been.<br><br>We are going to discuss this in the tuning meeting Monday, but my initial impression is that the AI is now working as it should, and I like how things are turning out so far.<br><br>What are your thoughts?<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

This is the evening edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016566.html"><b>Premium Server Thread </b></a><br>I just noticed that we need to consolidate these now :)<br><br>Anyway, we're just crunching some numbers based on multiple requests along those lines that have been posted here on the boards and sent through email. We haven't yet defined what exactly "Premium CS" means, but if the idea looks promising, we'd certainly define it before launching any servers of this type. Just as a note, the existence of any premium servers would not detract from the service provided on the standard servers. <br><br>I also noticed that many people are getting hung up on the concept of "premium".

I personally dislike drives to remove consequences for mistakes, as it removes the incentive to avoid making them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016386.html"><b>Verant Email Addressses</b></a><br>Actually George Scotto can be reached at gscotto@verant.com or gscotto@station.sony.com. All personal email addresses follow the "First initial, last name" format, and are either at station.sony.com or verant.com. In many cases, both will work. <br><br>I should stress that everyone out there with their name in the public light gets a ton of email, so individual responses are not always possible. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016385.html"><b>AFK</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: However, I ask that setting AFK would reflect not only on the /who list, but be visible on the player's name. ]</i></font><br><br>The next patch will append "AFK" and/or "LD" to names as the status indicates. I disagree that this is really much of an issue on the PvP servers to be concerned with, as it's already available in the /who list. <br><br>There's no reliable way to seek out LD people<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013215-2.html"><b>Crimson Robe of Alendine </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is it possible to get the appearance of the Crimson Robe of Alendine changed? I have had this robe for some time now and have always been very dissapointed in the fact that it looks exactly like an easily obtainable and very common mid level Magician quest robe.]</i></font> <br><br>No plans to do this. We've already made the mistake of making the lower level magician robe use the same graphic, but going back and revisiting the "look" of existing items keeps the team from moving forward in other areas. We've committed, going forward, that lower level items will not be assigned the same look as higher level ones to avoid the problem in the future. <br><br>It's not so much the time that it would take to make one change, but that associated with going back and revisiting these issues in general. I hope that you understand.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016010.html"><b>Resist Rates Changed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Resist rates changed again.]</i></font> <br><br>No, they were not. <br><br>Resists, fizzle rates, duration of invisibility, duration of frequently used buffs, and a few other things frequently spawn "post-patch anecdotes" about some sort of change. <br><br>Bad rolls, or a series of bad rolls are always possible, and do not indicate a change. There are a *number* of people out there who scientifically analyze everything in the game, and had any of this stuff actually changed, you'd see them all here bringing it up.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014419.html"><b>Mages</b></a><br>I'll be honest with you by telling you that there's no "drive" to improve the mage class as we don't see it as being necessary for their health. Mages are very apt within the game, and while every class can come up with ideas that really wouldn't hurt anything, we're focusing on putting in new content for a broader array of gamers. <br><br>I did however want to comment on the "Tornado" idea. I don't think something like that would be appropriate for the magician class. Were we to decide to put something presented in that manner in, it would probably go to druids, being a weather oriented event.</UL>

Gordon Wrinn again addressed the recent UI changes in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016231.html">following thread</a> he started on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>By now you've noticed some UI changes that were put in yesterday in preparation for some more robust changes that are planned. In light of the positive comments and the number of people anticipating some further enchancements, we'll have some new things for next week's patch.<br><br>In HUD mode, all boxes (target, group, chat, hotboxes, spell icons, etc) will become movable. You will be able to place them anywhere on the screen that you wish and their position will be recorded in the EQCLIENT.INI file. Furthermore, the "Spell Effects" box will also be resizable, to choices of 3x5 (current), 2x8, or 1x15. <br><br>Finally, the Chat window will also be resizable. Resizing horizontally will cause more text to be displayed per line. While resizing vertically will still only display a maximum of 10 lines, the spacing between the lines will be dynamically adjusted. I know that many people felt the font size changed in this patch, but really only the spacing between lines was reduced at higher resolutions.

Gordon made <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016303.html">an announcement</a> regarding the new Fiery Avenger-style quests on the Gameplay Board late, late last night:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>I've noticed a number of questions popping up in regards to the class epic quests implemented in the last patch, with concerns of them being broken in one way or another. <br><br>I just wanted to stop by and let everyone know that we've had a team of testers working on the quests, along with the game designers who implemented them, for the past two weeks non-stop. All quests have not only been confirmed as working, but have been confirmed with every race/class/deity combination available. We wanted to be absolutely sure that there were no problems in implementation and that players were not left wondering what is going on.<br><br>Given this, the GMs and Guides in game will not answer any questions in regards to these quests or components of these quests, other than to say that the quest is working. Furthermore, the specifics regarding every quest are known only by the designers and the Test team. The GMs and Guides have no way to look up any information that might be requested to address them in a more in-depth manner. It is essential that the Designers and Test team maintain absolute secrecy in regards to these quests in order to preserve the mystery for those who endeavor to discover and solve these quests on their own.<br><br>I will tell you this: These quests are different from any other quest implemented in EverQuest thus far. The designer of each quest spent in excess of a month on each design, several weeks on implementation, with a final few weeks of testing. <br><br>I wish you all well on your quests.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Gordon hit the boards hard tonight and posted the following messages to the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016206.html"><b>UI Enhancements</b></a><br>Part of the included enhancements to the UI is that bags can be opened when in the HUD mode. For instance, if you were to a general inventory slot in a hotbox, you can open a bag now without shifting modes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016212.html"><b>Shrink</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So I was wondering, why is this spell dungeon only?]</i></font> <br><br>Because we didn't want people running around shrunk as a matter of course, but rather wanted the spell to be used when it's use was necessary. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The size problem is taken care of in dungeons by using the Shaman Shrink spell or Shrink potions. But you cannot cast this spell while outdoors.]</i></font> <br><br>The shrink potion will work outdoors for situations that you've mentioned above.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016218.html"><b>FAQ Suggestion</b></a><br>I imagine that people can search out a few keywords and go to the appropriate section. That said, I'll see if I can give a few more directions in the future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016222.html"><b>Ducking Out of Combat</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But why does it tell you that you have ducked out of combat when you haven't done a thing? I'd rather get a message saying "The beast has your scent." ]</i></font><br><br>You are never invisible to a creature that has you on its hate-list. Hiding while in combat merely activates the "Evade" function, which will reduce your hate value, but never remove you from the list. The creature will still be mad at you, but the point is for him to be more mad at someone else in your group. It's like a reverse-taunt. <br><br>The message you get just tells you whether or not you've successfully "evaded".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016202.html"><b>Emote Output</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: % or @, no matter to me, but please... <br>Can you make it so it works in ALL forms of output?<br>/say,/em,/gu,/gsay,/shout,/ooc,/auction (no reason for auction but completeness is nice ) ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, that is indeed our plan for implementation of the %-codes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016205.html"><b>Kiting Nerf</b></a><br>Some NPCs flee when they get low on health. It sounds like this is what is happening here. I'm not sure if these *particular* NPCs fled previously, but your observations indicate that they do now.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016187.html"><b>Rancor's Faction</b></a><br>He should indeed be back on beta neutral faction.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016170.html"><b>Unable to Patch</b></a><br>I don't think that there's an excessive number of people connecting to the patch server currently. I'd have to chalk it up to an ISP or local system problem. Have you tried removing and reinstalling your TCP/IP protocol? I received an email from a customer the other day who said that this fixed a similar problem.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016184.html"><b>Gordon and His Email</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does Gordon answer his email?]</i></font> <br><br>Some of it, but I spend the vast majority of my time here on the boards, as individual emails are not a good way to reach a lot of people. <br><br>I typically go through mail to see if there's anything there that I asked someone to send me, forward a bunch of mail off to customer service, and answer a small number that are sufficiently concise.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016186.html"><b>Indecent Kunark Prices</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: $72,45 ($16.95 upgrade + $55.50 shipping).<br>It's about $30 more than purchasing the full retail box (Everquest + RoK) here in Sweden.]</i></font> <br><br>If the cost of the upgrade+shipping is more than the full box, I would definitely recommend that you purchase the full box and use it as an upgrade. We've little control over the price that our distributor charges for shipping.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016167.html"><b>Cool Upcoming UI Improvements</b></a><br>As it turns out, we'll very soon (probably in next weeks patch) opening up the ability to move the boxes where you please. We'll also be allowing you to resize the buff box (3x5, 2x8, or 1x15). <br><br>As for the order that the boxes are filled, it's the same as it was before in relation to direction.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016127.html"><b>Kiting Banable?</b></a><br>Kiting, whether it is done with snare, DDs, DOTs, or AEs, forward or reverse, is not an exploit and is currently acceptable. I would however caution those kiting to avoid accidently training people while doing it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016137.html"><b>Mark of Karn, Part 2</b></a><br>I just noticed that the last thread was closed as it was fast approaching the point at which threads become unstable, so I thought I'd begin a new one. <br><br>In response to the posts thus far, we are going to discuss the issue again on Monday at the tuning meeting. The general consensus here in the office is that we may have overreacted with the change, and not fully accomplished our goal. We'll keep you posted come then.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016119.html"><b>SoW Bugged?</b></a><br>There have been no changes to SoW speed, and this is the first I've heard of the problem that you mention. I also mentioned it to Rowyl and he hasn't heard of it either. It sounds as if you may have been crouching inadvertently. I've done that by accident before.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016051.html"><b>Monks and Weapons</b></a><br>Nothing is saying that lower level monks can't wield the new weapons, just that if they do, they'll take a penalty to their defensive abilities. <br><br>To answer the original poster's question as to why 55 and 60, and not some other level: We had to make some decision, and decided that raise it at a lower weight wasn't appropriate given the items that exist in the game. I should mention that it is not intended that monks should be able to don all of the best gear and remain under the cap. They need to decide if the downside is worth the upside for the particular encounter.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016105.html"><b>Haste</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does that mean that the Mith 2 Hander (21dmg/40dly effect: Haste) has had it's damage bonus increased? Or does it count the sword as being a 21dmg/30 something dly weapon because of the haste. A bonus would be great for this weapon, once again making it the superior blade that it sould be]</i></font> <br><br>It's based off the base-damage of the weapon, not the hasted-damage. In other words, if your weapons lists 40 delay as the delay, you get the additional bonus regardless of which haste items if any you are wearing.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015968.html"><b>Epic Quest Weapons for Lower Level Characters?</b></a><br>Weapons with particle effects are probably too resource intensive to implement on a wide scale in game. The nice thing about the eqic quest rewards is that they aren't something that *everyone* is going to have, so we can do something a little bit more special and out of the ordinary for them. The soulfire's particle effects were more of an experiment on implementing weapons of that type on a wider scale in game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015906.html"><b>Limited To 15 Buffs</b></a><br>The 15 buff limit has always been there, and is a core part of how the adventure system works in EverQuest. As more and more buffs are available, people must begin making strategic choices as to what buffs they feel they should have up. <br><br>This adds more strategy than just allowing everyone to throw up every buff that will stack.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015910.html"><b>Wurmslayer Nerfed</b></a><br>I apologize for not announcing this. The change apparently took place between last Friday and the patch yesterday. The "range" value on the weapon was set by mistake and was fixed by the game designers. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015917.html"><b>Balance In All Things</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Where am I going with this? Glad you asked.<br><br>I REJECT the theory that all classes are balanced. If they were all classes would be capable of handling a similar environment with equal ease or difficulty. This is not the case. ]</i></font><br><br>This comes back to the balance versus equality debate. Were the goal for the classes to be that they be equal, I'd agree with your statement, however the goal is balance. Balance is about complementary strengths and weaknesses. It's about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Take a look at the FAQ at <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html</a> for extended discourse on the subject.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015955.html"><b>3 Questions for Gordon</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. what is the status of the monster warping (aka ghosting) bug?]</i></font> <br><br>Some degree of warping will always be present due to the way that network latency is handled in the game. Those with high pings or packet-loss are far more likely to experience it than others. Some warping is usually preferable to having your movement constantly checked and updated by latency. <br><br>All warping is caused by a disagreement between the client and the server as to where the creature in question actually is. Information in a radius around the player is updated more frequently than that beyond the radius. Prediction is used to account for expected movements during the periods between updates. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. is it intended that draught of fire and volcanic draught have same mana usage, same casting time, same damage although one spell is level 51 and the other 54? from a couple of hours playing i also didnt see any difference in resistances.]</i></font> <br><br>The factors that you mention are intended. The second spell, Voltaic Draught, saves versus a different resistance than Draught of Fire. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. why do AE spell effect sometimes show and sometimes not?]</i></font> <br><br>Do you mean that the icon doesn't show on the UI, or that the particles don't show on the screen?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015654.html"><b>Tallon Zek Bannings</b></a><br>I apologize for the lack of consistency in regards to this issue. It's being addressed.</UL>

Gordon was very busy on the boards late last night and early this morning.  Here's the latest:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015899.html"><b>UI Changes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Call me color blind (entirely possible :P), but the green servers don't stand out much from the black servers.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm slightly colorblind myself. I went and bought a pair of Dockers the other day that I thought were dark gray, and turned out to be green. :(  I'll look into having the color brightened up a bit so that they stand out more. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Along these lines, why not change all servers to standard "stoplight" colors... Typically full servers, red... medium.. yellow... underpopulated... green.]</i></font> <br><br>Unfortunately, the terms "red" and "blue" are already taken: They're generally understood to mean PvP and PvE servers respectfully. I wanted to avoid confusion along these lines.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015799.html"><b>Haste Thread</b></a><br>Trying to consolidate the posts. There's about *another* 20 different threads on this subject in the first two pages. Please post over here :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015801.html"><b>More Damage Bonus</b></a><br>As it turns out, 1-handers above 40 delay were included in an additional bonus. Fast 1H wepons were however not included in the reduction applied to fast 2H weapons.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015798.html"><b>Mark of Karn Thread</b></a><br>Trying to consolidate the posts. There's about 20 different threads on this subject in the first two pages. Please post over here :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015775.html"><b>Damage Bonus</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: First off, you're not affected by the damage bonus change. It only affected 2 handed weapons.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, slight change here. I just found out that the additional bonus was applied to all weapons, whether one or two handed, if they have a delay 40 or higher. Damage reductions were not applied to one-handed weapons however.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015789.html"><b>GUI For Low Res</b></a><br>Default placement of the boxes is determined by dynamic scaling being computed on the Client. Though we may have a programmer look into seeing if he can force the looks for the 640x480 people back to how it looked previously, I can't guarantee that we'll be able to do that just yet.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015796.html"><b>Patch Times</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: come on verant, its time to do the patches at 1-2AM in the morning]</i></font> <br><br>1-2AM in the morning is during peak usage. It wouldn't make sense to do patches during periods of peak usage if it can be avoided.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015756.html"><b>Board Problems</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just kept timing out - on a cable modem, other sites fine. This happens too often... haven't been able to get any help from Sony. ]</i></font> <br><br>The boards get severely slammed when the servers are down for a patch. It dramatically increases readership here. I've been trying to get in all day myself :)  I'm happy that patches this long aren't the norm.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015786.html"><b>Lag</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: SO tonight I Down load the new patch, after a 9+ hour wait and guess what, Now the old world zones are every bit as laggy as kunark was.]</i></font> <br><br>Pushing new software to clients always consumes more bandwidth than normal gameplay. It should clear up over the next few hours as everyone downloads the new files. <br><br>We appreciate your patience.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015319.html"><b>Ranged Weapons</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why has verrent taken out the possiblity of a class wanting to use a bow as his main attack]</i></font> <br><br>It's not that we took it out, but that we specifically designed it so that it wouldn't be a "main" or "primary" form of attack. Spells have mana as a control mechanism that controls how much damage someone can do. Archery has no such control mechanism. Perhaps if we had included another "resource pool" of sorts, or tied it to stamina and reduced stamina regen, we could have done it, but we decided that spells would be the only primary form of ranged attack in the game. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012792.html"><b>Druid Spell Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: To me this one simple thing.

Just curious to your reasoning on this on. ]</i></font><br><br>*points at Snoota's post* <br><br>It's accurate, for the most part. I personally believe that it's a bit too powerful at lower levels, but we really don't have any plans to change it in the foreseeable future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015645.html"><b>Animated Emotes</b></a><br>Concerning @-codes, they are actually being changed to use the % symbol rather than the @. We had planned for it to go into yesterday's patch but had to pull it out of the code over the weekend due to a problem. I expect that they'll be in the next patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015686.html"><b>Damage Bonus Nerf</b></a><br>Here's the deal: <br><br>Every weapon in a primary weapons slot gets a damage bonus depending on level. Without this damage bonus, all weapons of equivalent ratio do the same damage over time. That means that a 20/40, a 10/20, and a 5/10 weapon would all do the same damage. <br><br>Now lets factor in the damage bonus. If someone was using the 20/40 weapon, the damage bonus would be applied ONCE in a 4 second period. If they were using the 10/20 weapon, it would be applied TWICE in the same period. With the 5/10 weapon it would be applied FOUR times in that same 4 second period. <br><br>It was this damage bonus which makes weapons that are very fast for their type better than those that are slower. The change we implemented merely flattened out the damage curve a bit.</UL>

On the Gameplay Board, Gordon Wrinn <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015788.html">wrote and posted the following announcement</a>:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>The changes that you are seeing to the user interface when in "heads up" mode are preparations for some major client changes to be included as part of the Velious expansion. <br><br>Currently you'll notice some size differences in some of the boxes. A new box has been created to hold "spell-effect icons" on the right-hand side of the screen. Those in 640x480 resolution will notice that the "target" box has moved lower with the "spell effect" box being above it, while those in resolution above 640x480 will notice positioning roughly equivalent to previous versions of the client. <br><br>At this time, the boxes are not movable or "manipulatable" in any way, in respect to size or position. Future enhancements will be forthcoming in the future, whether as part of general distribution or Velious release.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

This morning it came to my attention that these screenshots were taken with the server emulator program.  Because of this, I have decided to remove them from the page.  I'd I known that they were taken with the emulator they would have never been posted in the first place.
