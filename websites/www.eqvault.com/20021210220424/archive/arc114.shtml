<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Here's today's edition of the Gordon Infobits, a compilation of quotes and excerpts made by Verant's Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040980.html"><b>20+ Fallacies I See Every Day</b></a><br>Wow, thanks for posting this. I've been guilty of a few of these myself from time to time. I hope everyone reads this and keeps it in mind, it should help us communicate and debate more efficiently in the future.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040931.html"><b>Outposts</b></a><br>In the first line of the quote, I should have said "outposts" (meaning both FV and the evil outpost), not "outpost". The guild masters and bankers were placed in the outposts during beta since the Kunark beta testers were not allowed to leave to go back to their home towns. <P>These should have been removed before it went live, but that didn't happen. In any case, as I said before, we probably won't remove them at this point.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040992.html"><b>Experience - Outdoors & Dungeon</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: There is a multiplier for xp. Outdoor xp is much lower than indoor or dungeon xp]</i><P> Actually I thought this was fairly well known. I wouldn't say "much lower", but it is lower. <P><i>[Quote from original post: The guards being changed from 6 and 8 minute spawns to 20 minute spawns is purly in the interest of Verant wanting people to team in dungeons and play their game the way they see it. This nurf has nothing to do with newbies or protecting younger players]</i><P> I never said that the spawn time change had anything to do with newbies. That's what the gate-guard change is for. The spawntimes were changed to be based upon level rather than a default 6-8 minute timer because inner cities were more attractive for hunting than dungeons were. <P>We don't mind if you hunt in the cities, but it shouldn&#8217;t be more lucrative than hunting in a dungeon.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040922.html"><b>Changing Titles</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: An enchanter gets to go through Illusionist (which isn't that bad, except we don't get any illusions after lvl 44), Beguiler (which is something we do, but sounds real stupid), and finally to spend the rest of our time in eq at lvl 60 as a Phantasmist (this title is neither pleasant nor befitting the class at all).]</i><P> We actually though Phantasmist was one of the coolest level 60 titles out there. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Is there a chance that the Titles for 51+ can be changed?]</i><P> We're considering making some gender-specific changes, but that's about the extent of it. This is one of those subjects that is very subjective, and I doubt that we can give everyone exactly what they are looking for.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040920.html"><b>Evolving Factions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Could it ever be the case that factions change? Couldn't it stand to reason, that at some point, the dark elves would form an alliance with the Iksar. Or, even better, how about a quest, which, when completed, allows faction alignments to be dynamically altered. Factions are fine, but for them to NEVER change is just not realistic.]</i><P> We have the ability to do this, but the door would swing both ways and people get very upset when they become KOS in an area that they used to be able to go through unmolested. As a result, we've left the global faction issues the same in most applications. <P>The closest thing we've done to changing something in this fashion was the update to Kithicor. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Also, When a god such as Cazzic or Inorruuk is killed, shouldn't those characters that worship him suffer in some way-such as a innate decrease to magical resistance, or stats, etc. Shouldn't there be vast worldwide consequences when a god dies?]</i><P> Possibly, but before we could do that we'd probably have to put up a "Plane of Love" or something along those lines to give people another option. <P>Also keep in mind that Innoruuk is the god of Hate. What better way for a follower of hate to prove himself than to slay his own god? :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040918.html"><b>Does a NPC being immune to magic also make them immune to rogue poison?</b></a><br>Yes it would. It would also make them immune to melee attacks that empart a magical consequence. For instance, "Instill Doubt" might land, but the "fear" part of it would be resisted.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040917.html"><b>Immune to Magic</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I would like to know what exactly Abashi meant when he said they were making the newbie guards "Immune to magic". Does this mean they can't be hit by Magic based spells only? Or does this mean that they can not be hit by any spells, i.e. no spells casted on them will take effect?]</i><P> They will be immune to all harmful spells. Another passing NPC could certainly cast buffs on them though. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040739.html"><b>Group Linking & Experience Sharing Not Impossible!</b></a><br>I didn't say that it wasn't possible, just that it wasn't feasible. Given that there is no way that we can implement every suggestion that is made, and given that we have to prioritize where we want to concentrate our efforts, sometimes it makes more sense for us to concentrate our efforts in other areas, such as adding content/quests/etc., to the game. This is espicially true when the effort required to implement a particular suggestion is in excess of the benefit that it would bring. <P>We don't want to link groups for the reasons above. The amount of effort that it would require to make that change, including redesigning the entire grouping engine, experience allocation routines, and accounting for every permutation of things that can happen in relation to the group is time that we would rather spend doing something that would affect more people than this will. The entire game is built around groups of six, with very few encounters requiring larger groups. Furthermore, the fact that any shared experience at the level that people typically attack things that require more than one group would require dozens of slayings of those particular encounters in order to move the experience bar with a group size of say 12. The benefit for doing this is much less than the effort that would be involved to implement the suggestion. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi in 19 of 20 posts i can read that you have decided this or that without ever asking any player out there ]</i><P>People post their opinion on this board. For cases where we are willing to consider doing something based upon player input, we frequently ask for specific opinions here on the board. Quite often, if it will enhance gameplay, and we've decided to do it, we'll just wait until it's implemented before announcing it. For example, the change to meditation so higher level magic users don't have to look at their spell books any longer was a good example of this. Messages to the caster that indicate spells wearing off was another. <P>However, there are suggestions that are made that we have no intention of implementing. This does not mean that the suggestion isn't any good, quite frankly they are often very good. However given that resources are finite, and that the core engine of the game is "done", there's really no point to solicit specific opinion in these cases. <P>Please, by all means continue to make suggestions. If its a good idea, and it's something that we can reasonably plan on and put in EQ, when we can seriously consider it. If it's a good suggestion but there is no way that it will work for EQ, we'll keep it in mind for future products that we develop. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040683.html"><b>Enchanting Items Issue/Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: So in essence if I am reading this right Enchanters will NEVER be able to enchant items to proc a level spell etc. So are you going to let us do ANYTHING to items or is Verant planning to never give Enchanters the promised ability of item enchantment?]</i><P> It's certainly possible that we could enhance trade-skills to make use of enchanted metal or the vials of mana (from the thicken series) like Wu's Fighting Gauntlets, however the ability to take a mundane item and magically imbue it is not planned at present.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040616.html"><b>Pet Request</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: It would remove lots of guesswork on a pet's level. It would be most helpful when you're facing a 'high risk' creature such that a good quality pet will give you a definite edge and there is no 'greenie' creature for you to determine the quality of the pet.]</i><P> There's supposed to be some guess work involved. That's why the summoned pets have a level range that they can be. If we wanted everyone to be able to determine with certainty what level their pet is, we could just double the mana requirement and have it summon the best pet every time. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040598.html"><b>Experience Penalty</b></a><br>I've answered a large number of posts on this subject. It's a revolving topic, much like melee binding, that comes up about once a month or so. <P>Some classes require more experience than other classes to level, just as some races require more experience than others. There are a few reasons why this is done, but it basically comes down to a way to discourage everyone from playing the same race/class combo. <P>Experience requirements are what they are, and are not subject to post-production changes. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040495-2.html"><b>Spell Fizzling</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Hi Abashi or whomever at Verant can find the time to help me out with a question.I am a level 52 cleric with every single skill maxed out. But all of the new spells fizzle much more than it seems they should. Remedy is finally fizzling less after I hit level 52, but it still fizzles more than seems appropriate.]</i><P> The spells aren't fizzling any more than the level 49 spells did on the level you got them. On the level that you get any particular spell, your chance to fizzle the spell is pretty high. That chance decreases dramatically, but never goes away entirely, as you level.</UL>

Gordon gave what is presumablely the last word in the "melee-paying-an-npc-for-a-bind" issue.  Here's the word from the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>I'm sorry guys, but the binding issue is absolutely a dead horse, which is why I'm not jumping in the threads to remind everyone about that more than once a month or so. <br><br>The game has been out for over a year. In that time, melee characters have survived and prospered, even though the binding arrangements haven't changed. Melee characters will continue to thrive without implementing something such as this that would drastically change the pace of the game, game balance, class interdependency, and the penalty for death. <br><br>Binding is an advantage of being a pure caster in the same fashion that the ability to dish out melee damage, wear protective armor, etc., is an advantage of being a melee player. My advice to you is to make friends with clerics, wizards, druids, and anyone else who can make your travel go quicker. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Still, it will be quite dangerous for levels under 14.

Here's another round of posts and excerpts by Gordon Wrinn taken from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040653.html"><b>No More SoulFire?</b></a><br>Lucan could be killed before the change without killing the gate guards, you'll still be able to do it. Guards that are meant to be killed for the purpose of a quest haven't been changed.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040654.html"><b>Spells & Drop Rates</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Please increase the drop rate because of the 170 NPCs you claim CAN drop the spell, it seems that none of them are doing so.]</i><P> Yes, I said that over 170 NPCs have the ability to drop the spell, but I didn't say that people were killing the correct 170 NPCs :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040661.html"><b>Client Issue</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I've tried to figure out the timing--ie if weapon delay is 40, and bow delay is 45, I give it extra time before using the bow after turning off attack Still, though, I've found that I have to wait at LEAST one full recycle before I can use the bow again--even if the bow has a faster delay than my weapon! (ie, a Brutechopper with a 1-cam darkwood.)]</i><P> Interesting problem. It sounds like a client issue. I'll mention it to the client guy when I see him.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040673.html"><b>Grouping and Taking Down Creatures</b></a><br>There aren't many creatures out there that require more than one group to kill. <P>Even with those that exist, there's not really enough of them to make a noticeable impact on the experience bars of the people who do get experience. The experience from one (or even 10 kills) at the level that you are hunting critters that require more than 6 people really isn't going to make much of a difference. <P>People hunt things that require more than 6 people to kill for the excitement and the loot, not really for the experience. I guess the point I am making is that we are probably better off focusing our efforts on developing new content and addressing some outstanding problems rather than allocating resources to implement something that will only affect a small group of players, and even then, only affect them marginally.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040647.html"><b>Foraging</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Normally I would agree that "you gotta look around" however since I can forage rabbit on the boat in the middle of OoT I should be able to find berries while sitting on my butt.]</i><P> ACK! You've found the dreaded aqua bunnies! Seriously though, forage is intended to be a bit of an active skill, so you have to be standing :)<P><i>[Quote from original post: Besides who's to say I didn't look around to find a berry bush to sit next to?]</i><P> Well you couldn't have found the bush without foraging, but once you've foraged then there's no more berries on the bush for you to pick while sitting :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040613.html"><b>Spell Scrolls</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Ok the real point of this topic. If at level 12 a magic user could scribe a bind scroll he could sell it to warriors so they could bind themself in town only. And could only carry one because of it being lore. This would still promote the interaction with charecters, but one take some of the hassle out of getting a bind.]</i><P> Spell scrolls don't work this way. What you are basically describing is how a potion works, and potions can only be made via the Alchemy skill. Though it may not contain all of the potions that people wish for, it's the only way expendable spell-casting items can be created. <P>Since we don't allow anyone to create anything of value without some effort, opening some way for magic users to create expendable spell-casting items would basically have it working in the same fashion as alchemy, a skill that we want to keep as a benefit only for Shaman.</UL>

From Zifeer:<BLOCKQUOTE>Help wanted!<br> <br>I was browsing through the <a href="http://www.RallosZek.net">http://www.RallosZek.net</a> OOC board, over the last couple of pages and it occurred to me that although lots of folks regularly discuss PvP Tactics at great length, no one had ever sat down and tried to write some sort of definitive PvP Tactics Guide.<br> <br>So I thought maybe this would make a useful resource, both for newer players to PvP, and for more experienced folks wanting to start new characters with unfamiliar classes.<br> <br>Now I'd be the first to admit, I suck at PvP. Plus, I only have a basic familiarity with a few classes and how they work. So what I'd really like, is for those of you out there who know which end of the sword goes in the enemy, to lend me a hand.<br> <br>I'm looking for maybe three or four smallish (Around or under 500 words) guides to PvP combat, for each class. (Warrior, Druid, Shadowknight, etc) These should include tips and tactics on how each should best deal with the various other types of opponent (Healer, Tank, Caster, etc) and how to cope in a variety of situations, (Ambush(Either end of), Duel, 1 on 1, 1 on 2 or Pets, group PvP, etc)<br> <br>I'm not so much interested in what Verant should do for the Warrior or the Wizard so much, but more how best to use what each class has as things are now. I'd ideally like something to cover different level ranges too; I imagine a level nine Monk fights quite differently to a level forty-nine Monk. Some variety here would be useful too, allowing for a Beginners Guide and a Masterclass for each, perhaps.<br> <br>I'm not interested in motives either, it doesn't matter if you're a PK, Anti-PK or whatever; as long as you are good at PvP, I'd love to hear from you. This is purely intended to be a guide to PvP Combat, with no moral strings attached.<br>(Although try to avoid excessive gloating, etc; just the facts :)<br> <br>Similarly, I'm not too interested in PvE Tactics either; many other guides detail the best way for a Bard to take out an Orc Pawn and so on.<br> <br>I'm quite happy to proofread/spellcheck/format-for-presentation anything anyone wants to submit, and the best, most informative submissions will go to make up the guide. Full credit will be given to all articles I use, (Unless you'd rather submit anonymously, which is fine too :)<br> <br>Hopefully once all compiled, the finished work can go on <a href="http://www.ralloszek.net">http://www.ralloszek.net</a> somewhere, for future generations of young Zekers to study and learn from. (As well as providing material many interesting message board threads, no doubt! :)<br> <br>So if you've developed a useful or effective technique, or think you have mastered your class, and want to share it with others, please jot it down and mail it to me at...<br> <br><a href="mailto:zifeer@ralloszek.net">zifeer@ralloszek.net</a><br> <br>(If you've specialized in more than one class, don't be afraid to write one for each, the more the merrier!)<br><br>Thanks for your help all!<br>Zifeer</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Verant's Internet Relations Manager Gordon Wrinn <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040309.html">started a new thread</a> on the Gameplay Board regarding Newbie Guards found in Norrath.  Here's the first post in this thread:<UL><i>As we are sure many people are aware, there are guards that exist specifically for the purpose of giving new characters a place to run in order to be saved from a certain death. However, as many people have mentioned, these guards are frequently either dead, or engaged by players choosing to hunt them. This makes things very frustrating for newer players, and with the large influx of new players due to the release of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, we've decided to make a change.<br><br>Though we do not have a problem with players choosing to hunt guards, the newbie guards themselves, specifically the ones at the gates of cities and in the vicinity of newbie zones, need to remain alive under most circumstances. To that end, tomorrow morning we will be buffing up these newbie-protecting guards, making them immune to magic, and giving them some pretty good healing properties in order to make them less attractive to people hunting them.<br><br>In addition, though we will leave the guards inside cities as-is from the perspective of power, we've also found a problem with the respawn rate. Currently they are typically on six-minute timers, making them spawn much faster than an equivalent NPC would in a dungeon. We will be normalizing the respawn time of guards inside cities to bring them in line with dungeon NPCs. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>In the second post on this thread he said the following:<UL>While I agree with buffing up the newbie guards, I think it's foolish to increase the spawn time on the others. Why exasperate the problem of overcrowded dungeons by making the other areas less viable?<br><br><b><i>With the release of Kunark, the 4 recent servers, the fact that 3 of the Kunark Dungeons haven't really been explored to any great extent, and the fact that the Planes have thinned out a bit, we feel that the overcrowding problem in dungeons is well on its way to being corrected. We don't feel that this change will negatively impact that.</b></i><br><br>However, what about the guards you are SUPPOSED to kill, that are part of a quest?<br><br><b><i>Those guards are inside the city, and won't be subject to this change, beyond changing the respawn time. We'll also be upping the drop-percentage of the quest items in order to compensate for the less prolific guards.</b></i><br><br>Sounds fair. Better make sure this becomes a MOTD on all servers before you get flamed too much by those who don't get the message on the Boards. I'm just looking forward to seeing just how "unattractive" these new and improved guards become. <br><br><b><i>We'll put up a patch message tomorrow when the changes are made. An MOTD probably isn't necessary for this change.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the third post:<UL>We tend to raid cities and towns as part of our own quests and RP events for the guilds. Uber-izing the guards outside the main gates will most likely spell alot of death for even large numbers of high level players forming raids. The least you could do is make the names of the buffed guards red or something to denote them being the 'uber' guards. This also goes for our RP allies and enemy guilds such as House DeVir and the Skorchers.. guess raids are going to be out of the question from now on ;( (gee thanks)<br><br><b><i>I imagine that you'll still be able to melee the gate guards to death given a large enough party. We don't think that this will be happening so much that it nullifies our goals for these guards so we left it possible.<br><br>As for raids on cities, these should actually be even more possible now. Before, the spawn rates on guards inside the city was so fast that no one could really kill them all off. That would certainly be possible now.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the fourth:<UL>Oh Joy! A fix that only those under 5th level could love! My heart soars! <br><br><b><i>Well, being under level 5 is about the only experience that all EQ players have shared at one time or another, so I would hope you'd be more supportive.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the fifth:<UL>Yeah what about the dread outer guard Abashi? They get buffed up and you end up cutting off Lavastorm, Najena, SolA, and SolB to a lot of players.<br><br><b><i>The change will only apply to the newbie protecting guards such as those at the gate or in close proximity. The ones that wander all over won't be changed. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

EverQuest's targeting system was disucssed in a recent response Gordon Wrinn made on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the original post followed by Gordon's response:<UL>Why is it that the game isn't programmed to be smart enough to recognize that when you don't have a valid target for something like backstab, pick pocket, bandage, etc... that it doesn't have to grey out for the full duration? Isn't the duration representing how long it takes to bandage someone? Why does it take so long to recycle if you aren't actually BANDAGING anyone? This is a really simple thing to fix...<br><br><b><i>There's a few things like this in game and I imagine that we could do it if the time frees up, however I do wonder to what extent should we attempt to make the UI foolproof. <br><br>People in the past have asked for confirmation boxes for attacks (usually after they accidently attack an NPC when meaning to speak to them) as well as for something to stop them when they try to cast a buff or a heal on an NPC. There are a number of other things as well.<br><br>One of the factors of the game is learning how the UI works, and in what cases you can or cannot perform certain actions. When someone makes a mistake or gets something wrong, there is a consequence for doing that, such as for the SK who accidentally harm-touches himself, or the paladin that accidentally lays hands upon the dragon. Should these consequences for doing the wrong thing not exist?</i></b></UL>

From Andreas:<BLOCKQUOTE>We are two swedish students, at Umea university, who are writing a paper on<br>what makes MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games) popular<br>for our bachelor's degree. You can help us by answering our survey, at<br><a href="http://ctw.cs.umu.se/evals/externals/games/">http://ctw.cs.umu.se/evals/externals/games/</a> , and thus provide your opinion<br>on how a MMORPG should be constructed in the future. Since we have never<br>heard of any academic reports of this kind we are really interested in the<br>results. Hopefully the developers take notice and construct them after your<br>liking, since you are the ones buying their products ;-)<br><br>Thanx in advance,<br><br>Andreas Steding <br>Fredrik Ostrom</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks and good luck!

Back on the Gameplay Board, Verant's Gordon Wrinn was busy creating more posts.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040247.html"><b>Paladin Spell Quest</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: A while back i heard of a Paladin only spell available at 49. Is this quest broken?]</i><P> No, not broken, it just isn't in yet. I don't have an ETA, but June is looking good.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040250.html"><b>Paladin Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1. The paladin quest spell. All we want to know is why its not in the game yet.]</i><P> The quest isn't done yet, and I apologize that I don't have an ETA. June is probably a good bet, as the Live team is going to take some time off after getting Kunark fires put out. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 2. The lvl 55 spell you said you would report back to us on but havent.]</i><P> The spell and scroll are in there. Paladins should check the cleric guild.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040229.html"><b>Funny Thing on eBay</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I saw this on Ebay and couldn't help but LMAO. This person actually thinks this little paragraph of legal looking talk will make it ok for them to sell on ebay. <P>Tunare Everquest Goblin Two Hand Sword<P>Even tough its name is Two Hand Sword is actually a 1H slash weapon. It gives some of the best stats you will find on a 1H slash weapon as well. <P>By bidding on this auction you verify that you are not an employee of, nor a relative of an employee of, Sony or Verant. Furthurmore you verify that you are bidding with the sole intention of trading the sum of 1CP for the item listed. You have no other intentions including,but not limited to, determining station names, determining character names, and providing Verant, Sony, or any other person or entity any information whatsoever. I can traval anywhere in Norrath to make this trade. I will accept Visa and Mastercard through Paypal. I will also accept Checks and Money Orders as payment. Good luck on the bidding.]</i><P>This is pretty funny. I hope that people realize that we will employ common-sense in any enforcement. If you are selling the items, then you are selling the items, and efforts to invoke technicalities really won't impact our decision.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040164.html"><b>Level 54 Wizard Spell Voltaic Draught Broken?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: To put it simply Votaic Draught does the EXACT same thing as the lvl 51 spell Draught of Fire. Same damage, same mana, same casting time. I am assuming this is broken because what would be the point of going through 3 major hell levels for no spell progression?]</i><P> This isn't a bug. The intent was to provide wizards with some fast-casting medium damage spells versus all of the saves. Please keep in mind that the levels from 50-60 do not so much represent an increase in power for casters, but them becoming more well-rounded. </UL>

Experience in groups was the subject of a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037835-2.html">recent response</a> Gordon Wrinn posted on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the post:<UL><I>There seem to be a couple of issues here in the thread, the first being linking groups for shared experience, and the second being linking groups for enhanced communication. In both of these cases, we've weighed the various pros and cons of each situation and decided against them.<br>Linking groups for shared experience isn't feasible from a technical standpoint. The code that determines how experience is split up, and the group tracking mechanisms in game are part of the central core of EverQuest, something that we would rather leave intact and instead focus our time on adding new content to the game. <br><br>Shared communication has been ruled out both for that reason (though communication would probably be easier), and to increase the challenge of encounters that require multiple groups. One thing that is difficult about these encounters is that communication is difficult, where it should be. You have 30 people in a room all going after the same critter, and it takes real skill to keep everything sorted out, even with everything filtered out via the chat filters. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

A place called w00t.org has kicked up <a href="http://www.w00t.org/archive/reviews/eq_rok/eq_rok.php3">another review of Kunark</a> giving it a score of 4/5.  Here's an excerpt for those interested:<UL>I installed RoK which took about 15 minutes and then had to download massive amounts of patches for it which took about an hour on my 56k. When I finally got into the game I logged onto my server and had to choose from an Iksar Necromancer, Warrior, Shadow knight, Monk or Shaman. I chose Necromancer knowing that they were fun to play and the thought of an Iksar wearing a robe just seemed very cool to me.</UL>Thanks Malak!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon made a few posts this afternoon on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the lowdown:<uL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039653-3.html"><b>Level 51+ Spells Not Dropping?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why isn't Abashi replying?]</i><P> Because either I or Aradune has replied to several other threads. With 40 threads liable to pop up on any given subject, we usually don't copy/paste our replies to each one. <P>The original author is incorrect in his assertion that "Across ALL servers, not ONE level 51 - 59 spell has been dropped. Not ONE, not even ONE, ZERO spells have been dropped. Zilch, zip, nada, nothing." <P>They are dropping.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040144.html"><b>How long was Kunark beta tested?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: How long was Kunark beta tested? Why is there a test server? What purpose is a test server when you don't test things or the things you do test still end up "wrong"?]</i><P> I'm sorry, but it happens. It is true that a hundred-thousand people can find more problems in less time than 500 external testers, and that's the easiest way to explain it. There are certain things that testers won't do that live customers will. As much as we'd like to have everything 100% perfect 100% of the time, it's probably not a realistic goal that can hold up to having 200K separate personalities thrown at it.<br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: Why did you answer someone who posted to my post and not address any of the questions I asked? That wasn't very nice. Sorry, not a flame, I am usually your fan...]</i><P>  His quote was the most concise one in the thread that basically asked the same questions as yours. There were some problems with the loot that was dropping and we needed to fix them. <br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: I don't like the fact that it was NERFED.  I don't like the fact that stuff of Kunark mobs (not in dungeons) is better than most planes gear.]</i><P> Don't these two quotes contradict each other? You don't like that some of the stuff is better than planar stuff, yet you don't like that the drops were nerfed. <P><i>[Quote from original post: If they were to revert to the pre-Kunark nerf stage for 2 months, I guarantee that many of the problems that have popped up as the result of player interaction will slowly dissipate. However, I can guarantee they won't because they are afraid at a little experimentation.]</i><P>  We had god items dropping off of level 40 outdoor critters. It had to be fixed, and no, we won't purposely reintroduce the problems to "experiment". We don't have the option of doing a P-wipe in two months when it becomes obvious that the entire game economy is broken, so no, we won't take that chance. What would be the benefit of doing this? Player satisifaction? Players would be satisified in the short term just by virtue of getting a bunch of cool stuff that they couldn't normally get. However in the long term they would get bored, since there would be nothing left with any meaning for them to acquire.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040224.html"><b>"Why Verant Doesn't Want You to Enjoy EQ"</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Verant has losts its vision. It feels that EQ has made a big impression on the MMPUG market and if they can just keep its customers happy long enough for them to get Star Wars up and running then most of their customer base will leave EQ and jump right into Star Wars.]</i><P> Completely incorrect. Though there will surely be some crossover, it wouldn't be entirely smart of us to purposely plan on stealing our current customer base in order to populate another game. <P><i>[Quote from original post: I know without a shadow of a doubt that they only care about the Bottom Line and not their customer base.]</i><P> The customer base is our bottom line. We can't care about one without caring about the other. <P><i>[Quote from original post: caters to a small minority of players]</i><P> Actually no, we're constantly faced with having to tell a small minority of the players "no" in order to maintain the integrity of the game for the majority. <P><i>[Quote from original post: You see, Verant has its vision wrong, they should be doing everything possible to upgrade this game as fast as possible, improve their internet link, reevaluate their decisions on factions, class limitations and caps, the difficulty of mobs, and the casual players.]</i><P> Though we welcome your opinion, this is where we'll have to disagree. The majority of the players do not want us making vast sweeping changes to the game. They want the game to remain essentially the same, with improvements. You seem to be advocating completely overhauling the game. Why would we want to risk upsetting the majority by doing this? <P><i>[Quote from original post: I love playing EQ]</i><P> And you are obviously very passionate about it. I with there was something I could do to help you understand our views.</UL>

Certis sends word that he has published a <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/Alteredworlds/MMPOG.htm">new MMORPG article</a> on Altered Worlds.  The article begins on this note:<UL>One minute your looking at three games: Everquest, Asheron's call and Ultima Online. Now, its RTS phenomena all over again, but this is much more dangerous for the un-weary developer. Warcraft II and Command & Conquer was released and soon followed by legions of piss poor clones trying to ride the coattails of their success. How many of the games actually succeeded financially? Age of Empires and Total Annihilation come to mind and of course Starcraft and the C&C sequels did well. That leaves dozens of games that bombed horribly. </UL>Use the link above to find the rest.

From Aracnakat:<BLOCKQUOTE>New Wizard Portal Found:<br> <br>Rumors are pouring in about a new wizard portal spotted in the desert city of Las Vegas.  Scholars all over Norrath are going crazy trying to figure out the correct spell components to use this portal.<br> <br>Investigators have spoken to the local peasants regarding this new find and have found that they refer to it as the Luxor Hotel.  Although the locals have no idea of the magical significants of this find, they have stated that they often hear screams and cheers emitting from inside of it.<br> <br>So far a few things have been concluded.  Norrathian scholars believe that you must take an Air-O-Plane to get there.  They have further concluded that Air-O-Planes can be constructed by tinkers of the highest skill level.  These tinkers must be at the Air-O-Port which is believed to be somewhere in the Plane of Sky.  (More on this as investigations continue.)<br> <br>On July 7th & 8th, 2000 a group of scholars, fanatics, and drunkards from the Cazic-Thule server will be traveling to this city to investigate this new Wizard Portal.  All are invited to attend this momentous occasion as we crack the riddle of this ancient portal.<br> <br>On July 7th there will be much eating, drinking and celebrating our arrival.  On July 8th there will be much eating, drinking and celebrating our findings.  We hope that you can be among us as we unveil and activate this portal into the unknown.<br><br><center>----------</center><br>OOC: The Cazic-Thule Bash will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 7 & 8, 2000.

On the Gameplay Board, Brad McQuaid <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039900.html">answered a post</a> containing questions about many different issues.  Here's what Brad said in response:<UL><I>He got his info from Abashi, Khadgarr, and he is correct.<br>More precisely we're at 73% retention. Of all the people who've subscribed to EQ only 27% of them have cancelled their accounts. This is over a period of 13 months.<br><br>Despite the fact that this is unprecedented and extremely high, we continue to improve the game and listen to our customers. While we cannot, of course, make everyone happy all of the time, we continue to do our best and the sales and subscriptions continue to let us know we made a game that a lot of people seriously enjoy. <br><br>What can customers look forward to? More. More of what makes EQ great, and more adjustments and refinements to make it even greater. I think the advancments made in Kunark are ample proof of our dedication and commitment to EQ as it evolves.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

A question asking <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039915.html">why Frogloks are in Kunark</a> was answered today by Brad McQuaid on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the dirt:<UL><i>2 resons, really.<br><br>1. We wanted to nice mix of old and new models in the Expansion -- blending familiarity and newness has always been key to EQ (including the setting, the creatures, etc.)<br><br>2. There's always finite time in creating a product. Would I like a new froglok model like there's a new goblin model? Sure! Heck, I'd like there to be tons more models... but one has to draw the line somewhere in terms of how much content you can get into a game in so much time.<br><br>Overall, I'm very proud of how many distinct models are in EQ, both in the original release and in the Expansion -- I don't think any other 3D game even comes close to the variety we have. The EQ character model team has a LOT to be proud of.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

EQ Executive Producer Brad McQuaid made the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039941.html">following post</a> on the Gameplay Board regarding how game decisions are made, and what role various Verant employees play in them:<UL><I>You are correct in a sense.<br><br>Abashi primarily posts answers to questions, policies, etc. <br><br>He absolutely has influence in decisions, but no less and no more than most people.<br><br>Game decisions related to EQ are made by commitee. We have tuning meetings where game designers, programmers, and other interested parties participate in debating current issues, coming up with new ideas, and deciding in general where things should go.<br><br>Smed rarely if ever gets involved in in-game issues.<br><br>For a long time I moderated and led the tuning meetings, but that is done primarily by the Producer of the EQ Live team now.<br><br>In any case, we are a team, and we collectively make decisions and preserve and protect the Vision(TM). Which is why, IMHO, EQ is such a great game: the teams behind the game care deeply about the game and have a lot of passion for it. This is the game we wanted to make, it's the game we play, and it's the game we will continue to build and enhance, all the while making sure it remains true to what EQ was (and is) all about.<br><br>But, then, if you really want to blame someone in particular, you might as well blame me :)<br><br>And so be nice to Abashi -- thanks.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

Brad <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039734.html">posted to the Gameplay Board</a> giving us an update to the Plane Clipping problem that's been around for a while.  Here's his post:<UL><i>We're still trying to isolate the problem.<br>We've not been able to reproduce it in-house.<br><br>We are trying to see if it's related to certain video cards, but have yet to see a pattern.<br><br>Here's how the clipping plane works in EQ:<br><br>Each zone has information about it in a 'Zone Header' -- this includes the type of zone, the name of the zone, the chance of rain/snow, etc. It also includes a min and max view distance (clip distance).<br><br>Your clipping plane slider bar works on a percentage basis. So, let's say you have it set in the middle, approximately at 50%. One zone might have a min of 500 and a max of 1000 feet viewable distance. In that zone, you'd see 750 feet. Another zone, however, might have a min of 500 and a max of 1500, in which case you'd be seeing 1000 feet unless you adjusted the slider.<br><br>There are two factors related to how we set the maximum distance: 1. ambiance and 2. how the zone was created. Some zones, for example fog enshrouded forests, have a max clip purposely set lower for effect. Most zones, however, have the max very close to the drawing distance set by the zone creator when he exported the zone. In other words, if we set it any higher you'd see visual anomolies or simply not see the world at all.<br><br>In any case, you should see some change when you adjust your slider. The more variance between the min and max, the more variance you'll see.<br><br>We will continue to try to isolate why there are some reports that the final 25% to 50% of moving the slider does nothing.<br><br>-Brad</I></uL>
