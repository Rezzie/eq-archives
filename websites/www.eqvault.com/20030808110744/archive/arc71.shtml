Alan stopped by the Gameplay Board this evening and made the following posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029531.html"><b>Confusing News with Reviews</b></a><br>Actually, I said that you were an inexperienced group. I meant that to mean that you hadn't played together (and a lot of you weren't really trying to play as a group). I in no way meant to say that you were not experienced players. I'm sorry about the poor wording on my part.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029488.html"><b>Answering Posts</b></a><br>I was giving my opinion. And I see that some agree with me. <br><br>It probably seems that we only respond to tell people that they are wrong. This is not true. It is true that we are more likely to respond to posts where we see an error so that we can correct it. And in the post that you were referring to I was doing what most of us call discussing a matter. That generally requires that I give my opinions and respond to the opinions of others. At times we will disagree (if we didn't there would be little point in having a discussion). Sure, I tell people when I think they are making a logical error. That does not mean that I don't listen to their point and try to understand their viewpoint.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029413.html"><b>Bad Impressions from GameSpot Article</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "-Okay, so to not waste my time on the boat, I need a GM to summon me."]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, they never set foot on the boat, so they have no idea how long it would have taken. I can tell you that the boat is pretty darn fast, them Gnomes are an impatient bunch. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "-I need 30,000 hitpoints to survive the Giant city."]</i></font> <br><br>Velious is hard, no doubt about it. But these folks were taking on the entire giant city&#8230; they were not an experienced group and some of them weren't experienced players. I would certainly hope that taking on a city full of giants would be a difficult task. How many hit points would you need to take on Neriak? :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "-We need 30,000 hitpoints to stand a chance at defeating Rallos Zek "]</i></font> <br><br>Read my comments above. And, after all, isn't Rallos Zek a god? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "-Great for Rogues, bad for everyone else. Rogues will be required in Velious dungeons I guess."]</i></font> <br><br>Required isn't the right word. Useful as heck, yes. I think you'll love what these guys came up with.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029473.html"><b>Coming Soon From Verant</b></a><br>We can do both, and more. We're a big company, and getting bigger all the time. I think it's great that we're doing more with the talent that we've got here. Our new games are going to be pretty sweet.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029376.html"><b>The Costumes</b></a><br>I met her at the gathering. Yes, we made the costume (made by the part of Sony that makes movie costumes). Well, most of it, she did the finishing touches and made the staff. She is the model that Keith Parkinson used for the artwork. No, you can't have her phone number. If I had it (and I don't) I wouldn't let you have it. I'm greedy that way&#8230; :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029313.html"><b>Bug that causes corpses to disappear?</b></a><br>That makes some sense to me. If a player character goes link dead he becomes a non-player character. If a non-player character kills a monster (no matter how much of the damage it does) then the corpse disappears and no experience is awarded. It seems like a bad combination of a necessary gameplay rule (becoming a non-player character upon link-death) and lag. I'm not sure what we can do about this&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029308.html"><b>Naming Problem</b></a><br>There really is a reason not to name your characters the same as NPCs&#8230; <br><br>I have made customer service aware of your problem.</UL>

Gordon <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029312.html">spoke about the success of EverQuest</a> in response to a post blasting the game for it's lack support for the casual gamer:<UL><i>There's no question that "success" in EQ revolves around building a proper network of friends. That however applies to those who play 2 hours every other day as well as those who play 10 a day.  Those who play less often just define success differently. <br><br>I'd have to take issue with defining the casual gamer in the same fashion that you have in your post. Rather than define it on the basis of how much time one plays, I'd rather define it based on the playstyle of the person playing. It's perfectly possible for someone who's a 10 hour a day player to be a casual gamer, as much as it's possible to define a 6 hour a week player as a powergamer. <br><br>EQ supports the casual gamer just fine, as the focus of the casual gamer is not consumption of content, leveling, and item acquisition; It's to "have a good time", by adventuring with friends, exploring areas, and overall experiencing the game. Leveling and item acquisition is ancillary to the goal of having fun; It just happens as a result of their adventuring. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

The raid is being organized by myself, Rbecka.. and Aalya (AKA &#8211; &#8216;The Sisters of Slash&#8217;) <br><br>Cassia, of the Silver Daggers, will be the battle commander for this raid. Watch for a follow-up post from her on how we will meet the raid's objectives.<br><br>Those needing teleports for the raid should contact me to arrange a ride. IMPORTANT: No teleports will be provided after the time listed above, unless it is during daylight hours.. as the primary hunt will be after dark.<br><br><br>The primary objective of the raid is to exact revenge on the massive quantities of undead that roam this zone and have been terrorizing folks for ages. Secondary objective will be, of course, whatever loot we can obtain and whatever experience can be gained. *** Note: it is highly possible due to the way this raid is going to be set up that your group may not gain very much in the way of experience. If this is objectionable to you, please make other arrangements for the day, because once groups are set up, if anyone leaves this could cause a major problem. (Can we say &#8216;don&#8217;t rock the boat&#8217;)?<br><br>Items will be lotto'd among the classes present who can use them using the /random 1 200 command. Ties will roll again. If no one present can use the item, the item will be lotto&#8217;d among the guilds present. When a lotto item is looted, the group leader should /tell me immediately what the item is. I will coordinate with the battle commander to hold the lotto between fights, with the group leader being responsible for handing off the item to the winner. Also &#8211; please note that there is a great deal of &#8216;no-drop&#8217; items in this zone &#8211; do not loot if you can not use it.<br><br>The group leaders will do all looting. (or a person designated by the group leader.) Split will be turned on, with gems & trinkets being donated to clerics & enchanters to help defray the cost of regents<br><br>Late arrivals to the raid should wait at the Rivervale zone and contact me via /tell. I will coordinate with the battle commander to have the person brought in. Under no circumstances should anyone try to reach the raiding party on their own. (Unless it is during daylight hours) Anyone who hears from a late arrival wishing to join the raid should send me a /tell with that information. If I do not respond in a reasonable amount of time, send the /tell again until I do acknowledge it. Late arrivals may have to wait a few minutes, but we will get them in to join the raid. All participants will be eligible for lottos and will receive an equal share of the group loot, butif you are a late arrival, you will not be eligible for the first lotto of an item that can be used by your class. (unless you are the only member of your class present)<br><br>The battle commander will designate a puller.(Hopefully with Kithicor experience.) Anyone wishing to learn from the designated puller should contact me via /tell once we have reached the area of the forest we will hold. I will coordinate with the battle commander and all requests to learn the area will be accommodated if at all possible.<br><br>All communication with me, as the raid organizer, will be via /tell, leaving the public channels open for use by the battle commander. As a reminder, we are attempting to increase our raid success rate by paying more attention to group and raid discipline. Players who repeatedly break discipline may be asked to leave the raid. Warnings, and removal from the raid in the unlikely event that it should become necessary, will be handled by me via /tell. <br><br>Official beverage for this hunt is my own personal favorite: Kalish. Feel free to bring as much as you wish, for there will be plenty of downtime during daylight hours.<br><br><br>Hope to see you all in Kithicor. May the &#8216;undead&#8217; die again  <br><br>Respectfully, <br>Rbecka the Hill Giant Wrecka <br><br>PS - sign up at the following link<br><a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/fsilverdaggersevents.showMessage?topicID=213.topic">http://pub3.ezboard.com/fsilverdaggersevents.showMessage?topicID=213.topic</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

From Brimstone:<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="http://MMORPGSTUFF.com">MMORPGSTUFF.com</a> is proud to announce one of many new shirts aimed at the<br>roleplaying community, both online and pen & paper. Last month we released<br>the "Attribute" shirts, featuring such things as: Intelligence, Strength,<br>Charisma, Dexterity, etc. This month, we plan to release all of the<br>alignments that many gamers are familiar with, such as: Chaotic Good (Now<br>available), Lawful Good, Neutral Good, True Neutral, Neutral Evil, Lawful<br>Evil, Chaotic Evil, etc.<br><br>Each alignment shirt will also feature a catch-phrase that applies to that<br>alignment. It is our hopes that gamers will enjoy wearing these shirts to<br>let those around him/her know that: 1.) They are roleplayers and 2.) They<br>enjoy playing a particular style of being.<br><br>While coming up with this concept and designing the shirts, I also realized<br>that the Live Action Roleplaying (LARP) community MIGHT have an interest in<br>these shirts for their events/conventions. If anyone from the LARP community<br>is interested, I would be more than happy to custom design shirts/items for<br>your events. My email address is: brimstone@lostorder.com, or ICQ: 206317.<br><br>You can find the Chaotic Good shirt, and all other items at:<br><a href="http://www.mmorpgstuff.com">http://www.mmorpgstuff.com</a> . Thank you for your continued support and<br>interest.<br><br>Brimstone,<br>Founder, MMORPGSTUFF.com</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

The folks over at GameSpot have kicked up their <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2651775,00.html">first impressions of Verant's Scars of Velious expansion</a>.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>The first thing we noticed in Iceclad Ocean was that there is plenty of snow - snow is everywhere. It covers the land and trees, and even the fauna such as snow cougars, snow gnolls, and dire wolves are snowy white. We wandered around this first zone for a while and came across the first building, the Tower of Frozen Shadow. There were plenty of animals wandering around, as well as shadow guardians, a new type of monster that resembled a whirlwind of bones. We were immediately attacked by these, but they were pretty easy to kill. However, frost giants, which looked truly impressive, were not that easy to kill. Giants populate other zones in EverQuest, but the artists have given Velious' frost giants more intricate textures and a more detailed appearance. </UL>Thanks Trey!

Here are all the posts Alan made so far today on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029279.html"><b>Absor Back on the Scene</b></a><br>Well, I only just got back into the office today. I was in Vegas at the launch party. <br><br>I know I don't post much, and I intend to improve that.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029212.html"><b>The Prima Guide</b></a><br>I can assure you that the guide was revised with the help of several players, players that know the game. I was slightly involved in helping to revise it before I started working for Verant, and the folks that helped out with the revision knew their stuff.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029171.html"><b>Showing the Game to Friends</b></a><br>We certainly don't have a problem with you showing our game to your friends. Heck, thanks for doing it. And if he played on it a bit, that's fine too. <br><br>But if he played enough to create a character that was so high level that he is unwilling to start a new one, then that is closer to what we would call sharing accounts. <br><br>No, we will not transfer that character to your friends account. If he had fun playing, I hope he will buy the game and play on his own account. He had fun playing the character on your account, he would probably have fun playing him on his own account on his own computer.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028487-2.html"><b>Hybrid Problem Discussion</b></a><br>I have a request on this issue. <br><br>Let's wait until after Velious before committing to any resolutions. I think you'll like what you see once you get Velious. I'm still reading this discussion, for sure. But Velious will introduce some things that might solve your problems.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028373.html"><b>Closing the Newbie Zone</b></a><br>I'll have a talk with some people here and see what the logic was behind closing the Newbie Zone. I'll try to get back with you on this today.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029234.html"><b>Censoring on the Boards</b></a><br>Well, my personal opinion is that once someone begins using foul language they are no longer intending (nor succeeding) to communicate. They are only venting and trying to elicit an emotional (usually angry) response. Sure, there are times when cursing is an effective way of communicating, such as during a brawl. We don't want our boards to end up in such situations where cursing is an effective way of communicating. <br><br>You may be talking about how we shut down a lot of political threads recently. We wouldn't have locked any of them if they weren't flooding the front page. We have no problem with off-topic, civil communications. But this board does have a purpose, and that is to talk about EverQuest. We can't have that communication cut off because the recent election was so darn close. It's certainly a worthy topic of discussion, but we can't let it take over these boards.</UL>

The official press release announcing PlanetSide was just released.  Here's the complete copy I was sent:<UL>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br><br>SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT ANNOUNCES "PLANETSIDE(tm)," THE WORLD'S FIRST MASSIVELY <br>MULTIPLAYER FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER<br><br>Makers of Best-Selling EverQuest(r) Bring Expertise to a New Genre<br><br>SAN DIEGO, Calif., November 8, 2000 - Sony Online Entertainment Inc. is pleased <br>to announce the development of "PlanetSide(tm)," the first massively multiplayer <br>first-person action game in PC gaming history.<br><br>"We're leveraging our experience with EverQuest into an entirely new genre. Imagine <br>a soldier-to-soldier combat and vehicular warfare game set within a massive persistent <br>environment," said John Smedley, President and CEO of Sony Online Entertainment <br>Inc. "'PlanetSide' is a logical extension of Verant's online capabilities."<br><br>In the game, players assume the roles of mercenaries and reside in a distant <br>galaxy where little semblance of law exists. In PlanetSide, these mercenaries <br>rise within the ranks of one of four specialized corporations that offer both <br>character development and professional growth.<br><br>"'PlanetSide' expands the first-person action genre into an entirely new universe," <br>said Kevin McCann, producer of the game. "Both team-minded players as well as <br>independent rogues are going to find a place within this game, which represents <br>the culmination of years of Verant's work."<br><br>"We've created a persistent world where you work to capture bases and increase <br>your worth over time - a place where you can return again and again, where your <br>accomplishments are recorded and translated into statistics, merits, and other <br>rewards."<br><br>More About "PlanetSide"<br>The "PlanetSide" continents measure approximately 64 square kilometers, varying <br>from arctic wastelands to scorching deserts. Players work to capture various <br>technological bases - using both soldier-to-soldier as well as vehicle-based <br>combat - to eventually influence the control of the continent toward their chosen <br>corporation.<br><br>There are four primary corporations that offer professional growth opportunities <br>and steady income: the mining industry, the technological industry, the science <br>and research industry and the military industry. These corporations "sponsor" <br>players - offer a starting apartment and a Personal Computer Terminal where they <br>can access job assignments, news, and e-mail.<br><br>"PlanetSide," published by Sony Online Entertainment, is due to ship the third <br>quarter of 2001 for the PC platform.<br><br>The game is currently featured on the cover of the December issue of "PC Gamer" <br>magazine. Six screenshots from PlanetSide are available for FTP download at www.filekey.com/linnpr/PS-Screens.zip.<br><br>About Verant Interactive<br>Verant Interactive Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Online Entertainment <br>Inc.

From Kitt:<BLOCKQUOTE>     Just to pass along, got my new issue of PC Gamer, and there is an <br>article on all the new Multi-player games in the works down the line. Also in <br>the issue is an article that seems to take issue with Verant over the "cease <br>and desist order " given on an Everquest MOD called "EQ Macros" in the <br>"eyewitness" section. While the article seems to laud the programmer over the <br>program, I see it as probably the way Verant does, its a cheat to make things <br>easier for one individual over another who does not have the program.

I wanted to quickly point out an <a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_1765_1.html">interview Daily Radar did today with Verant's Kevin McCann</a>.  For those who don't know, this month's issue of PC Gamer contained the unveiling of Verant's Planetside, a game Verant is billing as the world's first persistent massively multiplayer first person shooter.  Here's an excerpt:<UL><b>Daily Radar: Tell us about Planetside. What's the setup for the game? What's going to draw players in?</b><br><br>Kevin McCann: We're aiming to create a massively multiplayer tactical first-person shooter. Versus an RPG, the storyline plays less of a role because I'm trying to make sure that the game stays true to what it's trying to be -- a first-person shooter. We have some role-playing, but it's very light. People aren't going to be coming in here to socialize, they're going to come in to fight.<br><br>In the game, you'll ally yourself with one of four corporations, which are sort of your top level causes. They give you job assignments, character growth opportunity and professional advancement. <br> <br>You have access to abilities and implants as you advance. These are more like support skills. They don't impact you actual reflex performance -- you're not getting more hit points, you're not necessarily getting auto-aim. This is a first-person shooter, so you don't want players having an unfair advantage. There are, for example, electronic skills which allow you to hack into terminals or gain certain medical abilities.</UL>For screenshots and the rest of the interview <a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_1765_1.html">click here</a>.

Any account found with someone besides the registered and original owner of the account playing that character is breaking the EULA as set forth by Verant Interactive.<br><br>Any use of exploits or bugs will result in immediate disqualification from the event, and is a break in the rules of conduct as set forth on www.everquest.com. <br><br>Guides and GMs are considered judges and therefore restricted from attack.<br><br>The Arena is off limits to unauthorized pvp 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after the event. This is to ensure that the contestants and spectators are safe. During this time, play nice policy is in effect regardless of server.<br><br>Both wizards will be summoned out of the zone, and summoned back before the start of the match to clear any previous bugs with permanent spell effects.<br><br>Both wizards, once debuffed and resummoned shall be asked if they are ready for the match to start. Once the match starts, a timer will start of 30 seconds that the wizards are allowed to cast on themselves, and quickly rememorize the spells. The judge of the match will count down on every 5 second interval until the time is up, and at that time offensive spells maybe used. Mana used for buffs will not be restored. The offensive spells start at the 30 second mark regardless if wizard is ready for the next stage.<br><br>You cannot cast an offensive spell during the first 30 seconds, even if it would land after the explosion.<br><br>An explosion will start the 30 second period, and a second explosion will start the match. A single &#8220;Fault&#8221; will be allowed (Casting before the explosion), and an event warning (not an official warning) be given to the offender. A second &#8220;Fault&#8221; per match is disqualification. We do realize that this is a &#8220;Quick Draw&#8221; match and that players will be trying to time the explosions as close to the mark as possible to gain advantage.<br><br>No activatable items of any kind shall be used in the match. This includes any right click items.<br><br>No use of Invert Gravity shall be allowed, this is the only spell being removed from the event, because it can knock the wizard out of the ring.<br><br>Both wizards shall stay on the tiled area at all times, you may not stand on or behind the firepots. You may not stand on or in the throne. Use of yonder is of high risk, if you go out of the ring you maybe disqualified. Binding in the ring and gating to a different part of the ring is no longer allowed in any VI Event.<br><br>This is a test of magic, not melee. No melee combat of any kind will be allowed in this event. No ranged weapons of any kind will be allowed in this event. <br><br>Spectators shall remain seated and not casting during the match. Any spell casting shall be considered aimed at a participant, and either harmful or helpful to someone in the match. Anyone who casts any spell during a match can be death touched (for no xp loss) and removed from the arena.<br><br>Spectators shall not use shout for any reason, but use /ooc instead. This is so that those involved in the match use shout, and the channel can be turned off to reduce distraction to the wizards involved. <br><br>Spectators shall not interfere with this event. This includes helping or assisting a person involved in the match in any way.<br><br>Rallos Zek Specific Rule : There shall be no looting of any item at an event, this includes spectators. <br><br>Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek Rule : You may request to have your faction restored to the condition it was in at the last available save. This is to insure that no unnecessary faction hits are taken at an event.<br><br>There is no entry fee for this event, and the only prizes will be titles awarded to the winners. Title for winning at the server level will be the level 51 title for wizards. The title for the 3 runners up will be the level 56 title. The grand champion shall have his level 60 title given to him on his own server.<br><br>Those champions who go to test are bound by additional rules. The character used for the event cannot adventure on test for any reason. Handing off even the smallest items to a player on test is forbidden, as well as considered duplication of items.<br><br>The transfer of characters to test is midnight (give or take an hour) PST the night before the main event. <br><br>Lake Rathetear will be shut down several hours before the main event. The only characters allowed in the arena on Test for the main event will be the champion wizards, the judges of the event and the event staff, other members of Verant Interactive, and members of the press who sign up with Lady Daegarmo at least 3 days in advance via email.<br><br>All other characters on test found in the Arena during the main event will be summoned out of the zone and binded so they cannot return. <br><br>VI may limit the amount of people in the zone to control conditions of lag or frame rate for the participants. The event shall start open seating, but may close off during time. The Event Staff may use any sort of decision on who stays and who leaves to ensure the event is a success. This should not be implemented until a minimal of 150 players in the zone have been reached.<br><br>The Event Staff reserves the right to change the rules of the event at any time before, during, or after the event in the case of an unforeseen issue with the match.<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Events Coordinator<br>Verant Interactive<br><br>(Server event times and dates will be posted tomorrow)</I></UL>

Bishoopugget sent me the following letter:<BLOCKQUOTE>Queen Velazul Di'zok slain on Luclin!  (11/5/2000)<br><br>In what will be remembered as the epitome of teamwork and skill, a multi-guild raid fought it's way through the entire line of royalty within Chardok.  With the expert pulling of Wang and Khato of Apex, we made it to the Overking and bested him just 90 minutes after entering Chardok.  After such a flawless raid we decided that a full coffin corpse retrieval would be acceptable in the pursuit of knowledge and experience against the previously untouched Queen of Chardok.  Needless to say, 20 seconds after our battle with the Queen started it ended with her own death cry and the cheers of many of the finest guilds of Luclin.<br><br>A hearty congratulations to all the guilds and players at this unforgettable event.<br><br>Bishoopugget<br>Pappanug of the Nuggets of Justice</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Veeshan's Peak has been conquered by the infamous and controversial FoH guild on Veeshan:<BLOCKQUOTE>Silverwing (Deceased)<br>Hoshkar (Deceased)<br>Xygoz (Deceased)<br>Druushk (Deceased)<br>Nexona (Deceased)<br>Queen of the Ring of Scale, Phara Dar (Deceased)<br><br>This weekend, the Fires of Heaven made a committment. Guided by the<br>hands of Innoruuk and the rage and glory of Rallos Zek, the Fires made<br>their way from the bottom of the Peak, slaying all of the minions of the<br>Ring of Scale who dared stand in their way, to the top.<br><br>Mustering what powers she could, Veeshan sent her entire army at us to<br>stop our progress. The enchanter Silverwing met a swift death, the<br>shaman Hoshkar<br>demonstrated great battle prowess but was brought down to submission,<br>the bard Xygoz attempted to silence us with his songs but was slain for<br>his foul FOUL lack of harmony, the ranger Druushk defeated even WITH the<br>upgrade he received in Parry and Dodge - rumours of a lack of sufficient<br>casts of Jolt from Druushk abound, the Shadowknight Nexona sent back to<br>hell, and lastly, the Queen of the Dragons, the Cleric Phara Dar...<br>destroyed.<br><br>What rewards were received for such a tremendous accomplishemnt?<br>Hundreds upon hundreds of hours of preparation, so so so many deaths, so<br>many sacrifices, SUCH a showing of patience by the men and women of FoH<br>and our friends in Legion. What rewards were received for doing what was<br>said to be IMPOSSIBLE? I will leave you with this bit of wisdom, stay in<br>Sebilis and Charasis and save yourself the heart break.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Furor Planedefiler, Leader of the Fires of Heaven<br><a href="http://foh.noows.com">http://foh.noows.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the news.
