The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000311.html">Scaled Wolves</a> was one of the latest updates to be made on the Developer's Corner today.  The original question and Absor's response is included in the following text:<UL>Aegwyn wrote:<br><br><b>Please bear with the story or skip to the end for my suggestion/question.<br>Growing up in Cabilis I had never seen a furry animal except one that came across my dinner plate. Then when I began my Shaman training I saw my masters summoning wolves, yet these weren't the wolves I hunted almost daily to supply Klok Mugruk with scales for armor. These wolves had fur and were soft. I was naive enough to ask one of the Shamans why he couldn't summon a wolf native to our lands, I was backhanded for my questioning of a superior but I believed at the time it was more because he was not powerful enough to summon one of the greater scaled wolves of Kunark. But now that I have increased my abilities beyond many of my former teachers I find I am unable to summon a wolf more suited to Iksars. I have talked to the Scaled Heirophants in the temple in Cabilis and even travelled to the great Plane of Cazic Thule, its only called Fear by those who have reason to be afraid, to seek audience with the great one himself. I have yet to recieve an answer to my questions on this subject.<br><br>Is there anyway to make it possible for Iksar Shaman to summon a wolf that has the look of the Scaled Wolves well known in Kunark?</b><br><br>I've heard a similar request from folks that play Iksar Necromancers. They would like to see their pets look like the Iksar skeletons that we see on Kunark.<br><br>Unfortunately, in order to allow such a pet to be summoned by those spells we would have to make those models available in all zones. This would mean adding them to the 'global' graphics file. Right now this file is pretty much as large as it can get, and we can't add anything to it.<br><br>Obviously we'll probably be doing something to accommodate new graphics for Shadows of Luclin. How that will affect our ability to add those (and other) graphics isn't really clear right now.<br><br>In short, try asking me again after the start of next year and I'll see if we have a different answer for you.<br><br>Alan</UL>

While your preference obviously would be that this particular item remain as it was, we thought it better that it look a little more unique. A few other items were cosmetically changed as well.<br><br>In the long run, we understand that it's just as likely that people will prefer the old graphic as it is that they will like the new one.

A Curse of the Spirits matter was tackled in a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000308.html">new update</a> published by Alan on the Developer's Corner: <UL><b>Just wondering if the change to the Shaman Epic effect was intentional. Just to clarify. Curse of the spirits used to be a clickable dot that had some stacking issues with other dots. The patch message said that it was modified so that the stacking issues were less of a problem. However now it seem to be a heal over time instead of dot, is this intentional or an accident?<br><br>Thank<br>Colal</b><br><br>That was an accident.<br><br>We'll get it fixed with the next patch.

The horrific events of yesterday was addressed by Alan VanCouvering in <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000306.html">the first update</a> on the Developer's Corner today:<UL>I don't think I'd feel right just picking up and responding to EverQuest comments without saying something.

We share in your grief during these difficult times."<br><br>The quote from our front page expresses how we all feel here in the office. I only want to extend my personal sympathies to all the families that this has touched.<br><br>We have received many letters, and I want to thank you all for sending them in. It's obvious that we will all be different people from here forward. If I don't dwell on this in my responses here it is only because I know that none of us will forget what has happened, and that you come here for entertainment not reminders of tragedy.<br><br>Alan</UL>

Normally real-life news issues aren't covered on this, or any other gaming site.  We'll call this one the exception.  First off, I wanted to include a few excerpts from the always-up-to-date guys at <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com"><b>Voodoo Extreme</b></a>:<UL><LI>World Trade Centers collapse after two hijacked planes hit, 10,000 emergency workers head to scene</LI><br><LI>Hijacked plane hits Pentagon, part of the Pentagon has collapsed.</LI><br><LI>American, United Airlines both confirm losing two planes each. The American planes alone held about 150 people each.</LI><br><LI>Federal buildings, United Nations evacuated</LI><br><LI>FAA grounds all U.S. flights, sends trans-Atlantic flights to Canada</LI><br><LI>Sen. John McCain calls attacks "act of war"</LI><br><LI>Israel evacuates embassies</LI><br><LI>U.S. stock markets close after the New York attacks.</LI></UL>With that said, I want to add in my own two cents here.<br><br>We all need to take a deep breath and relax a little.  What has happened is tragic.  But we absolutely must not let the terrorists demoralize us.  If we do than we make ourselves even bigger targets in the future, as well as handing the opposing powers an added bonus.<br><br>Secondly, everyone take another deep breath.  I'm now hearing reports that the price of gas is soaring in some cities because of the number of people panicking.  I've heard similar things with some supermarkets.  This is irrational behavior, I'll go as far as to even say it's Y2K on steroids.<br><br>The United States of America is not fading away anytime soon.  There's no mistaking it, we've been hit hard.  We've also survived much, much worse over the last two centuries.  Naturally, we will recover from this, but how soon is up to us.<br><br>So please, everyone keep their heads on.  If we do we can overcome any obstacle the world throws at us.

Gilwen fired off a new report to me with more details on this new NPC:<BLOCKQUOTE>Tis I, Gilwen the Game Warden again. I have some new dirt on Nibble that I didn't mail in before. After talking to a guide buddy of mine (who will remain nameless for obvious reasons) it seems as though Nibble is an NPC using some new Luclin AI code. In which he will respond to commands. As an example, when I took the screenshots, I told him to smile. I noticed that he smiled. When people were telling him to summon them, he would do so. Obviously this is a bug of some sort, to summon on command.<br> <br>I tend to believe the guide, however, this does seem difficult to believe. But if indeed this kind of AI is possible, I'd get out of the United States quickly, because Skynet has become self-aware and will begin firing missles at its targets in Russia. Thats a great movie... Verant is a cover name for Cyberdyne Systems.</BLOCKQUOTE>Also, here are the screenshots I was unable to post the other day:<UL><LI><a href="/eqshots/Nibble1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/eqshots/Nibble2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a></UL>Thanks!

Rexik added some additional comments to the Nibbles event we reported earlier today:<BLOCKQUOTE>To expand on Gilwen's story of Nibbles on Zegony a little.  Upon entering the game and shouting that I was looking for a group, I was mysteriously summoned to the top of a fishing hut in the Oasis.  After checking everything around me (PC's, NPC's, etc) I determined that this may be a GM event, but there was no special reason for the summoning.  I went about my business of grouping and killing as normal.  However, during the course of the night, several things took place.  First I had heard that Nibbles was killing a person that went link dead.  Eventually, this person DID die while link dead.  (Fenril, I think it was).  After multiple petitions, one of the GM's came online and claimed to not know what this new creature was, and that it did not appear on their spawn list.  They also made sure to tell us that it definately was NOT human controlled.  After a bit of typical banter between the GM and the players, a second GM came in and told us to beware, that he believed that Nibbles would be back.  So, it sounds like Nibbles will be a regular NPC in the Oasis.  Apparently, Nibbles is around level 35, however, will not noone around 24 on up can land a hit on him, only lower levels.  A group of people decided to kill Nibbles and, after doing so, received some potions, one of which was a single use SOW potion.  I do not recall the rest of the potions given to the users that killed him.  So, look for Nibbles on a server near you soon, I imagine.<br> <br>Rexik<br>18 Warrior - Xegony</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the info!

Gilwen was kind enough to send us this report of a recent Gm event:<BLOCKQUOTE>At roughly 12:30PM EST an invulnerable crocodile named Nibble appeared in <br>the Oasis of Marr. He went around randomly attacking newbies, but I only saw <br>one death. Perhaps this is a new GM event where it dosnt end in a massacre? <br>Im not sure, he seemed pretty nice to all the high level people. It seemed <br>only people within his level range could hit him, I couldnt. Im 50. <br>Anyywayy. I attached two jpgs of him.<br><br>No interviews were allowed or I would have gotten the dirt, if there is that <br>much dirt to a crocodile event.<br><br>He also seemed to summon a bunch of people on top of one of the fisherman <br>huts by the oasis. /shrug Nice collection! Too bad If I upload another image <br>Ill be past my upload limit! Maybe someone else will send one in<br><br>Gilwen the Game Warden<br>50 Ranger</BLOCKQUOTE>Those images Gilwen referred to are currently not uploaded due to the FTP problems we've been experiencing.  Once access is restored I'll post them.<br><br>Thanks Gilwen!

Another update was added to the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000305.html">Corpse Delay thread</a> on the Developer's Corner:<UL><b>Corpses with no experience on them, I think at least, would be ones that were sacrificed for essence emeralds and duels. IIRC dueled corpses don't have experience giving ability on them, because you don't lose any you can't gain any back when you get resurrected. Please correct if I'm wrong.<br><br>Miladian Dratsaver<br>Xev</b><br><br>You're not wrong. I had forgotten about duels, the perfect example of a corpse that doesn't have any experience.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br><br>Snapdragyn wrote:<br><br><b>Sorry, but that just confused me more. Does this mean that a level 29 or lower character's naked corpse would poof in 3 minutes, instead of the 3 hours granted to 30+? I hope I'm misunderstanding this, as that would be GRAVELY unfair (pun intended ;p ).</b><br><br>Empty corpses last 3 minutes unless the owner of the corpse is level 30 or more, which last 3 hours.<br><br>You are understanding that correctly. There's not really anything unfair about that. The only reason to have a naked corpse around is for experience granting resurrection, something that is relatively rare for folks under level 30. And those under level 30 that think they might get a resurrection should leave items on their corpses.<br><br>Bodies take up computer resources. Our servers have to track them, and your computer has to draw them. We need to remove the corpses that aren't necessary to reduce the overhead. The current system works well.<br><br><b>Just one added comment about this.<br><br>I VERY MUCH disagree with the use of the term: 'whichever comes first' in your explaination of corpse decay time.<br><br>It is not only a lie, but in being so, is very misleading - and has cause me and other people i know to lose level 40+ corpses...<br><br>The term 'whichever comes first' very much, directly stating - 'either this one or that one, whichever of the options first occur'. BUT THATS NOT TRUE.<br><br>You don't get either 24hrs online - OR - 1 week offline time. You definatly DO NOT get whichever of the 2 comes first - they are BOTH one and the same as you apply them. <br><br>IE: if I spend 12hrs online - and 5 days offline. My corpse WILL decay. Yet according to what you say, i have until i reach 24hrs online - or 7 days offline. Neither have occured, therefore neither came first - why does my corpse still decay????<br><br><br>Yes, I notice that since the last time i complained about this, you added the 'note'. It does mention that 1hr online counts as 7hrs offline. Although it doesn't state the other half of the truth - which is that 7hrs offline - also counts as 1hr of your online counter. As it is ONLY ONE COUNTER - you can't properly use the terms OR or 'Whichever comes first' when discussing ONLY ONE THING. (ergo one decay counter).<br><br>Simply removing the 'whichever comes first' from that corpse decay description would do SO much towards making this 'ACCURATE' let alone readable. It would also be nice if you fully explained the whole relation between 1hr online = 7hrs offline and vis a versa. <br><br>The way it is now written, not only is inaccurate, and misleading - but as I've previously mentioned. This very mis-print of yours has caused me and countless others to lose corpses and many good items. (one item i lost is irreplacable as it came as result of being in like 5 or 6 seperate GM quests - and this now tainted view will probably stop me from ever again spending the time to do GM quests - as fun as they are)<br><br>Thanks for listening to my little Rant...<br><br>Dresdin VaLore</b><br><br>Well, it's not a 'lie'. It is, however, certainly misleading.<br><br>There is, indeed, only one timer on a corpse. If you have a 6th level or higher, experience giving, non-naked corpse in game and you spend 12 hours playing and then 3.5 days not playing, your corpse will indeed be gone.<br><br>I'll rewrite that bit and try to make it less confusing.<br><br>------<br><br>Player Corpse Decay Times <br>p.20: The bottom half of this page outlines corpse decay times based upon level and login status. The times provided are incorrect. The player-corpse decay times are as follows. Please note that all times are in real time, not Norrathian time: <br><br>Level 1 &#8211; 5: 30 minutes<br>Level 6+: 24 hours of online time, or 1 week of offline time (or some combination of both). <br><br><br>Empty corpses (with no items) have a different timer than those with items:<br><br>Level 1 &#8211; 29: 3 minutes<br>Level 30+ : 3 hours (total, online or offline).<br><br>*Note: It is best advised to get your corpse right away. Also note that when considering corpses that are not empty one-hour in game is the same as seven hours out of game, and that the timer on a corpse ticks down whether you are in game or not. If you have a level 12 corpse with items on it in the game and spend 12 hours playing and 3.5 days out of game, that corpse will be gone. Also, be advised that leaving your computer at the character select screen or play on another character on that same account counts as time in game as it relates to the corpse decay timer.<br><br>------<br><br>Alan</UL>

Are you wondering how the new SZ control map works?  Surprise, surprise, Alan announced that SOE/Verant would probably not be releasing any technical information about the map design.  Here's their reasoning:<UL><b>Just another reminder. We still don't know how the map is maintained.<br><br>-Welfin</b><br><br>That's true&#8230;<br><br>I've been thinking about that since we put the maps up. I'm not so sure that announcing how control is determined is such a good idea, for two reasons.<br><br>First, it's not really an exact science. We're limited by a few things, not the least of which is that the more things we keep track of to use for creating stats and maps and such, the bigger load we put on the server.<br><br>But more importantly, if we announce how it's done that might make it very easy for some one (or some group) to tweak the system and give us false numbers through some sort of trick that would invalidate the results.<br><br>I am curious, though, as to what method you folks think would work best. Though we're not really ready to invest time on changing the current system right now, we might be able to do so in the future, and any interesting new ideas would be welcome.<br><br>Just keep in mind the restriction that some of the wilder ideas are going to be impossible&#8230;<br><br>Alan</UL>Spotted <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000304.html">on this post</a> at the Developer's Corner.

Corpse Decay was a recent issue tackled by Alan in <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000305.html">this Developer's Corner update</a>:<UL><b>There seems to be some confusion regarding how long naked corpses last before they poof. From the Feb. 21, 2001 patch message: "Naked PC corpses that have experience and are above level 30 will now last 3 hours instead of 3 minutes." <br><br>I take this to mean that if you die naked, in order for your corpse not to poof in 3 minutes, you must have earned some experience since the time of your last death. To prevent this, I often bum a copper or rusty weapon from someone while performing a coprse retrieval. However, many people state that putting something in your inventory is not necessary to prevent naked corpse poofing, since your character has experience (unless it is level one). <br><br>A little clarity, please? <br><br>Jolla Petbane<br>E'ci</b> <br><br>It means that if you can gain experience from a resurrection done on that corpse, then the corpse will remain. I can't think of any examples of corpses that won't give experience back from an experience giving resurrection (perhaps sacrifice victims...), but if there were any, then they would only be around for 3 minutes if there was nothing on the corpse. <br><br>Here's the blurb from the Supplemental Manual:<br> <br>-----------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Player Corpse Decay Times <br><br>p.20: The bottom half of this page outlines corpse decay times based upon level and login status. The times provided are incorrect. The player-corpse decay times are as follows. Please note that all times are in real time, not game time: <br><br>Level 1 &#8211; 5: 30 minutes<br>Level 6+: 24 hours of online time, or 1 week of offline time, whichever comes first.<br> <br>*Note: Empty corpses that are level 30 or above characters will remain in game for 3 hours. It is best advised to get your corpse right away. If that is not possible, remember that one-hour in game is the same as seven hours out of game. Also, be advised that your corpse decay is still advancing if you leave your computer at the character select screen or play on another character on that same account. <br>-----------------------------------<br><br>I hope that clears things up a bit. <br><br>Alan</UL>
