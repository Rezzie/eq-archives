The Test Server is the subject Shadoe explores in his latest article titled <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid988510119,92452,"><b>When Proddies Attack</a></b>.  The following is a clip from this editorial:<UL>One thing you have to understand about Test Server players, is that they value their isolation. No, not value&#8230; covet. I can't emphasize enough how compelling this sentiment is to these people, even to the point where they brave the ever-present threat of complete character wipes to obtain it. The Test Server has already weathered one item wipe, triggering an exodus the likes of which Fidel Castro has never seen. What does that tell you about those players who chose to remain? <br><br>I have to admit, I was one of those who chose to stay. Though I left to play elsewhere for a while out of spite, my characters remained on Test, placed in a state of suspended animation with the hopes of being cured by future generations. A cure was never discovered, so I continue to play on both Test and production servers to this day. In my arrogance, I believe this qualifies me to lecture you, the reader, on what happens in the Test Server when proddies attack.

Another round of updates were spotted the Developers Corner today posted by Alan:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000136.html"><b>Kodiaks in the Great Divide </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: According to one of the latest patch messages, Kodiaks in the Great Divide were supposed to be seen as "animals" and be affected be Animal specific spells. My friends and I went hunting there last night (Fri, 3/30/01) and guess what? They arent. We all got messages saying that "this spell may only be cast on animals". As we were set to do a little fear hunting and our spells and attacks were geared for it. Luckily, we could root and move to remem spells and change plans. No one died, but it was close. I did petition a GM and he did tell me that the code did not go into this patch as was announced. <br><br>Please tell others about this, I just dont want anything like this to happen to anyone else because they beleived the mis-information posted on the patch message. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Kirlan Oakthorn (Ranger, level 38th, Druzzil Ro) ]</i></font><br><br>Sorry for the confusion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This change currently exists on Test server, however in the last patch we did not patch Great Divide, this change should go live in the next patch. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe ]</i></font><br><br>So the change should make it in the next patch. Again, I'm sorry for the error in the patch message.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000134.html"><b>Flowing Thought</b></a><br>Danyela wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I posted a comment about this yesterday, but I did not get an email response letting me know it had been received, so I am submitting it again. <br><br>Many months ago, when enchanters were getting defensive about the dillution of their defining class abilities, a promise was made rather vehemently that no items would ever be placed in the game that granted the wearer a clarity effect. This was to guarantee that enchanters would always have something unique they could do, especially in light of all the illusions and other versatility given to other classes that used to be the domain of the enchanter. <br><br>Now, with the upgrade of the planes, Cazic Thule himself drops items that grant the effect of Flowing Thought. Ok, that isn't officially clarity, but 'a rose by any other name would smell as sweet' should come to mind. It may not be clarity, but it sure acts like it. Even better in many respects as it never wears off. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I can only guess that you're not very familiar with the actual effect of Flowing Thought. <br><br>I'm an advocate of the whole idea of not blurring the class lines. But here your are concerned about something that if rubbed vigorously on that line, with much force and perseverance, won't even smudge it. If Flowing Thought acts like clarity, then I act like a Pulitzer Prize winning author&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 'a rose by any other name would smell as sweet' <br><br>This is true, however the difference between Flowing Thought I and Clarity II is more like the difference between a rose and a dandelion. <br><br>- L. Poe ]</i></font><br><br>To top all that off, we're talking about the New Cazic here, not the little baby Cazic that you used to know&#8230; <br><br>And I wanted to let you all know that we won't be sending individual e-mail responses to every comment. We don't have the resources for that. There is a confirmation page that you'll see when you successfully send in a comment. If you see that, rest assured that we have received your comment. There's no need to send it in again. I'm sorry that we can't respond to every comment. I'd like to, but it's just not possible.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000010.html"><b>Absor Wrong!</b></a><br>Furgan wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You Wrote 'All area of effect spells will damage the caster.' <br><br>Actually, all AOE rain spells will damage the caster, not all AOE spells. Lighting storm is an AoE rain spell and as such it will damage the caster. You may want to go back an post a followup to your comment that it was intentional that an AOE Rain spell was chosen as the proc for this weapon, since I beleive that is more of what the original person was asking. ]</i></font><br><br>And to make it worse&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: He's right. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe ]</i></font><br><br>It seems that I was wrong&#8230; :)<br><br>My point still stands, though. Not all weapons can be the best weapon in the game. This one has uses. The fact that some people won't use a certain items does not mean that we need to change it so that it is a more powerful item.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000137.html"><b>Damage Shields</b></a><br>Cedral wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I always wondered why player-cast damage shields are unresistable. <br><br>It seems strange that a level 50 rock golem would take damage while pounding a level 9 character with a thistle coat. <br><br>Don't you find it odd that a monster that easily resist Draught of Fire (51 wizard) is burned every time by the lowliest magician damage shield?]</i></font> <br><br>The answer to that, really, is: Because they are, that's why. :)<br><br>Thistle coat is easy, it's a physical object. If the golem could resist it, then it would be resisting sword blades and arrows. <br><br>The fire one is different. I could, I suppose, come up with a good enough explanation for it. Like perhaps the fact that the shield resides within the aura of the person being hit, that shield is much stronger than normal fire spells. Or that by actively reaching into the fire the opponent is sacrificing his ability to resist the fire. <br><br>The reality is that those spells just don't give resists, and their power and effectiveness is based on that fact. If they were resistible they might be more powerful. <br><br>Though I like the idea that in order to reach into that fire to attack their enemy, someone has to give up his resistance. They are willingly putting themselves into the fire, and that gives it the power to burn them. I'll stick with that one.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000130.html"><b>Server Split Questions</b></a><br>I'm going to respond within your post. With so many questions, it's easier to read if the answers appear directly after the questions. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have been playing EQ for about 6 months now, and I have found out that the server I play on was initially a split server. Recently, a new split server (Zebuxaruk) was opened, splitting off E'Ci and The Rathe, as I recall. <br><br>My questions revolve around split server economics, and are many. Though you might be able to answer several or all of them with a simple publicized policy statement regarding split servers. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, there isn't a lot of mystery about it, but I'll answer your questions as best as I can. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 1. What metrics do you use to determine when or if a split server is created, and what servers it draws from? ]</i></font><br><br>We create new servers based on all sorts of factors. Primarily we put one up when their seems to be a need because of overcrowding on existing servers. There's no science to deciding whether a new server will be a 'split' or a new server. We judge that based on the perceived need as much as anything. And when it is a split server, we will split people from servers that are the most crowded. Keep in mind that some servers don't have their busiest times when others do. Recently, for example, we split Karana when it wasn't one of the top two busiest servers during the usual prime time. It was, however, much more crowded during its own prime time than the others were in theirs. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. Why are all the split servers delineated from exactly two "older" servers? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I think one was split from three servers. Splitting from two servers usually gives both the older servers the relief they need, while not flooding the new server with too many people. More than two could easily fill the new server (when you include players that start fresh on that server) so much that the new server would be needing a split&#8230; And that sort of defeats the purpose. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. Why are there not more opportunities to "split" from one server to another? ]</i></font><br><br>Undercrowding is just as much of a problem as overcrowding. We won't split a server based only on a slight or possibly a temporary increase in population. Splitting a server and ending up with an underpopulated server is something we need to avoid. We always approach adding servers with caution, nobody really knows how a server will react to a split, how many people will move and how many will stay. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. Once a new server is designated the "split to server", what is the likelihood of it becoming the "split from server" and in what time frame?]</i></font><br> <br>It's really the other way around. We'll usually identify that we need to split a server or two and then gear up to set up a server to split them to. The timeframe varies, as do all things, based on what's going on here or with our Ops department at the time. But we can move pretty fast. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5. What happens in the case that you have characters on both of the servers being split from and you /movelog from both servers? ]</i></font><br><br>If you have a total of less than eight characters, then they would all be available to you on the new server. If your total, however, is greater than eight, some of those characters will not be available to you. You'll have to delete the ones that you are willing to lose until you have reduced yourself to just eight. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 6. What is the procedure when characters from the two different splitting servers have the same name? Who keeps it, who changes? ]</i></font><br><br>When two servers are split to one server, one of the characters with duplicate names will have an 'x' appended to their name at random. The player whose character has had the 'x' appended to its name will be able to have his or her name changed by a GM to a new name. But the character without the 'x' will be the one to keep the original name. If you get the appended 'x' you will have to go by a new name, you won't be getting the old one back.<br><br><br>But, as was the case recently, if characters are moved to a server by a second movelog and there is an existing character with that name on the server, the existing character will keep the name and the new one will have the 'x' appended. The newly moved character can petition to have his name changed to something new. This is one of the risks of moving to a new server. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 7. What is the chance of a new server that would allow splits from ANY other server? ]</i></font><br><br>None. For reasons I explained before, the new server would be hopelessly overcrowded. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 8. More specifically, what is the chance of Xev and Drinal splitting onto the same server in the future, and if they were to do so, how long into the future do you think that would be? ]</i></font><br><br>I can only guess that you have friends on one of those servers, and you play on another&#8230; :)<br><br>I can't possibly tell you when or if those two servers will be split. The odds of them being split to the same server would seem slim. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 9. Could you explain again publicly why you will not move characters between servers except under the split server scenario? ]</i></font><br><br>There are a few reasons. People would want to switch servers just to avoid their reputations. We don't want people to be able to duck out on their reputations. And server economies vary. Pulling an account with a ton of items that are not as rare on one server to a new server where they are extremely rare provides an advantage to that player. And a lot of moves like that could affect the server as a whole. Moving characters also requires a fair amount of work on our side. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Thank you for your response. <br><br>Esqubel Highmind<br>23rd Enchanter of Xev<br>Povar-Tarew Artisans]</i></font><br><br>I hope that clears things up a bit.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000131.html"><b>Divine Glory</b></a><br>Rangerguy wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: When 'Divine Glory' wears off it says "Your Divine Strength Glory". Shouldn't it say "Your Divine Glory has worn off" or somehting close to that? ]</i></font><br><br>We fixed that a few patches ago.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000133.html"><b>Barrier of Force</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The effect on the wizard epic, Barrier of force, is currently overwritten if a druid casts Protection of the Glades on the group. This is extremely frustrating in the high end game where PoG is cast frequently. Is this the way it is supposed to be? I sincerely hope not, making an epic effect useless in some situations seems wrong. Thanks, <br><br>Omalley the Tactician<br>Officer-The Relentless<br>Cazic-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>Both of these spells have a regeneration component. They will not stack. <br><br>It's up to you to decide which effect you prefer. Not all spells will stack with all other spells. Choosing the effect you want on your character is just as important as choosing which spells to memorize.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000132.html"><b>Annul Magic</b></a><br>DarkNature wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: (I couldn't decide if this was for QA or not, but after reading the 'official use' for the QA forum, decided to stick this here.) <br><br>One tiny question: Annul Magic is listed as having a level 61 requirement for Enchanters. Is this "working as intended?" :)]</i></font><br><br>Once again, our spell guy, Mr. Poe, had a comment about this: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: When a spell is listed as being level 61 for a class, it means the spell is not usable by the class. The spell scroll needs to be updated to not have Enchanters listed as one of the classes. ]</i></font><br><br>Listing it as a 61st level spell or having it just not list the class at all really have the same effect. But the cleaner way is to take the class off the list for using the spell. <br><br>You can ask a question like this in either forum. The fact that it seemed like a bug makes it appropriate for the QA forum, but the fact that your question actually covers a game mechanic that some people don't know about makes it something I can answer for you. So either way is fine. :)</UL>

Mr. Poe assited Alan several times today by helping to explain certain spell questions on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000126.html"><b>Scale of Wolf</b></a><br>MagisteRex wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I posting to learn if the way Scale of Wolf works currently - drops the way in invis does if you cast or attack or are attacked - is a bug or as intended? <br><br>If as intended, please reconsider this. Druids get an upgrade to sow in wolf form at the very least and I believe they get one other. Bards call all outrun sow. Why cannont Shaman have an upgrade that is functional? It is worthless even as a long distance traveling spell since it drops if you are attacked. I have ended up in bad situations due to casters casting on me and even due to a greenie skellie getting in a lucky hit as I passed it. <br><br>This is absurd. <br><br>If the way it currently acts is a bug, please fix it! ]</i></font><br><br>I don&#8217;t want this to end in a lecture&#8230; so I'll do that now. <br><br>This was a perfectly nice comment. You made your points, you had your reason, and you were making sense. And then you decided to add the "This is absurd." line. This line changes the tone of your post from upset, but rational to upset and verging on irrational. It does not make your point stronger and it will not somehow make us more likely to agree with you. <br><br>I just needed to point that out. <br><br>Mr. Poe has an answer to your concern: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This effect was changed several patches ago. Scale of Wolf will only drop if the spell expires, the enchantment is dispelled, the person with the buff turns on auto attack, or the person with the buff casts a spell. The spell will not drop if a spell is cast on the person with the buff, or the person with the buff is attacked. ]</i></font><br><br>So, while it was not a bug, it was something that we decided to change.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000128.html"><b>New Wizard Translocate Spells </b></a><br>Thibz475 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think you should stop and take a look at the fact that all of the translocate spells are being pointed towards light-race held areas. Not one of these teleports is geared towards Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres. Arguably Iksar too. Throw in a Nektulos or a South Ro please. ]</i></font><br><br>Today seems to be teleportation day here on the boards&#8230; :)<br><br>More from Mr. Lawrence Poe: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: These spells are being pointed towards "four post" wizard spires, as they are the strongest conduits arcane teleportation on Norrath. ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for the information, Mr. Poe.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000129.html"><b>Ro's Fiery Sundering </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As far as I know the only way to get this spell is to kill Sifaye which give you bad Tunare faction, or get incredibly lucky and nail Garou who is defintely on Norrath's Most Wanted list. <br><br>Is it intentional that Verant put one of our most useful and sought after spells on mobs that would ruin our PoG faction if kill them? Quite a few of us rather like keeping our faction. So that means we have to pay 10k plat to buy them from necros. <br><br>Druids everywhere are burning with curiousity and frustration over this one. <br><br>Wysteria ]</i></font><br><br>There are several places where you can obtain this spell. I hesitate to list them, but I'll tell you this much. It drops in Wakening Lands, Iceclad, and the Tower of Frozen Shadow. And we'll be increasing its drop rate in the Tower a bit. <br><br>And having such a good spell be hard to get isn't contrary to our intent. Good stuff should be hard to get. We're adjusting the frequency of its appearance a little. But it's never going to be easy to find.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000125.html"><b>New Teleport Spell &#8211; Translocate Group </b></a><br>Elmarid wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think a great spell idea would be one that sent everyone back to their bind points, it could be called scatter or something like that. It could be the same amount of mana and casting time as an evac, and would be useful at the end of a grouping session when everyone wanted to get back the city they were bound in. Just a suggestion. ]</i></font><br><br>I don't want to give away too much, but since I don't have any news about Shadows of Luclin&#8230; :)<br><br>Another short quote from Mr. L. Poe: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This is going in next patch in the form of Translocate: Group it will drop in Velious. ]</i></font><br><br>It is, of course, my job to tell you that we intend to have it in the next patch&#8230; :)<br> <br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000124.html"><b>Spell Stacking Bug?</b></a><br>Nicol wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Topic: Spell stacking bug <br><br>The ranger spell call of earth overwrites/blocks the enchanter epic quest effect speed of shissar. <br><br>The latter is almost always the preferred buff.<br>Their effects are unrelated, far as I know. ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, they both add armor class. I believe that the ranger spell adds greater armor class than the Speed of Shissar, and that would explain why it is the spell to take precedence. <br><br>This is not a bug. There will be cases when you must choose one spell over the other. Not all spells will stack, nor are they intended to. Making decisions about which spells to have cast on you is the same sort of decision that you have to make about which weapon to use or which armor to wear.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000123.html"><b>Voltaic Draught / Draught of Jiva </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I hope this is the correct forum for this question: <br><br>I acquired a spell the other day Draught of Jiva and found out I already had it but it was under another name, Voltaic Draught! These spells are not merely similar they are identicle in terms of resist, mana, casting time, spell recovery and damage per level. (the only difference it seems is the level of the spell: one is 54 the other is 55) Since I find this type of thing no where else in the EQ spell lists I have to ask whether there has been some mistake in the creation of this spell. <br><br>Validata Tempestas<br>Wizardess Of Saryrn ]</i></font><br><br>They may appear to be the same, but they are not. Draught of Jiva has a slight stun attached to it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000122.html"><b>Critical Hits With Bolt Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello, <br><br>I have recently been hearing about "Bolt" type spells doing critical hits (doing about double their normal damage). I was wondering if this is true or merely a rumour. <br>Any information would be much appreciated :)<br><br>Feynan Escafon'ea<br>45th Wizard<br>Karana Server ]</i></font><br><br>It's a phenomenon, not any sort of new special skill&#8230; here's what Lawrence Poe (spell guy) had to say about it: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: We have not added critical hits to bolt spells. I've read a couple emails about this phenomenon. I spoke with Steve Clover about this, what appears to be happening is that the mage will cast a bolt spell and due to lag or the zone server not updating it will miss and fly off. The caster of the bolt will cast another bolt spell as the 2nd bolt spell is hitting the first one will correct itself and also strike the target, giving the appearance of a "Double attack" or "critical hit". ]</i></font><br><br>I asked, 'cause it seemed strange to me, how a bolt could wander away like that. It seems that it's not something that strange. Bolts aren't that different than NPCs. If one can go astray, the other can. <br><br>So if you've seen this happen, check the circumstances. If these double hits have occurred after a previous bolt seemed to have missed or you thought it just failed to report damage (and might have, indeed, missed), then that would explain it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000119.html"><b>Questions about Cannibalize 2, 3 ,4 </b></a><br>RazcoForte wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: what is the significant changes ?<br>ex. HP to Mana exchange? ]</i></font><br><br>Lawrence Poe, spell guru, has a short answer for your question: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The Ratios of Cannibalize II and III were made slightly better. The hit point cost remained the same, but the mana return was slightly increased. ]</i></font><br><br>I also wanted to address something that I've been hearing a bit of lately. The changes to these original spells and the addition of the new one don't dramatically increase the power of the spell line. What they do is address an issue. Shamans everywhere were using Cannibalize I in preference to Cannibalize II because it was the more efficient. The improved spells address that problem. That's why they are only slightly better. The higher level spells are now preferable to those of lower level.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000120.html"><b>Teleport Spell to Bind Spot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I dont know if anyone has mentioned this before but I think it would be a much welcomed addition to the teleport line of spells! Teleporting a group to the casters binding spot would speed up guild raids, trips to town. There have been many times I got a ride to a druid ring and then got left to walk as they gate to town. Toss the idea around and see what you think please. <br><br>thanks, <br><br>Radrez of Lanys T'Vyl ]</i></font><br><br>A spell like this will probably never be created in Norrath. There are far too many ways that such a spell could be abused. We're certainly not set against the convenience that this spell might add. But there are far too many ways to use a spell like that to trivialize zone content and the challenges that are presented in the game world. <br><br>Sadly, this isn't much different than watching many episodes of Star Trek where the writer has to create silly reasons why transporters can't work in a given area or why they can't use their replicators to do, well, just about anything. I mean, if you can transport people by taking them apart and putting them back together again, then you would never need a doctor. Nobody would need to die&#8230; <br><br>But I digress. The idea here is that we don't want to introduce things into the game world that, by their very nature, make many of the zone designs and concepts meaningless. So, this spell will probably never be seen in Norrath.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000121.html"><b>Abscond </b></a><br>Lord_of_the_Pit wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Abscond - Self only teleport to zone safe point. <br><br>I was informed by the GM that this is not accurate, the description on websites cannot be trusted. <br><br>The spell can get you killed becasue in certain cases it'll bring you right in front of a mob (i.e. fear) <br><br>a. What's the point of this spell?<br><br>b. 600 mana and cast time 7.0 @ lvl 52 seems expensive for a spell that does a self-only teleport to possible safe place and clears aggro. ]</i></font><br><br>Mr. Poe has been taking his day responding to comments. I appreciate his time. And, as I should, I pass on his responses to you: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote:  Abscond will take the caster to the "safe spot" in the zone. Safe spot being a designation we use for the load in point of a zone. It is true that sometimes these "safe spots" are not always safe, but we try to fix them when we find them. In the case of extraplaner zones however, there really are no "safe spots"]</i></font> <br><br>The value of the spell is evident to me; to remove yourself from what appears to be certain death to a place where there is but a small chance that you will find yourself in danger. :)</UL>

Are you aware of how the quests/items work there and does this seem correct to you?]</i></font><br><br>Yup, we're very aware of how the quests work. I announced those changes the second I heard them so that you would have as much warning as possible. <br><br>Since then we've looked into other, more interesting ways of fixing things that we deemed wrong with this area (I'm not going into details, I love the fact that this zone is complicated, and I'm not spoiling things). I'm not sure how, exactly, we're going to make these changes yet. And it might very well include making many of these items No-Drop, as I mentioned. But I think that you'll see that it works out well in the end, and making those items No-Drop shouldn't actually be a problem for those that are playing in the zone. We're adding levels of convolution to the zone. :)<br><br>I can't explain it further, but if the items do become No-Drop, we are aware of the concerns that folks have brought up, and we know that it's nearly impossible to tell what's what up there. We're not going to make it so that those that do the experimentation will get the least reward.

When I bought this I reliezed there seems to be a woman in distress on the cover of the Kunark expansion. Does this have anything to do with a huge quest that takes place in Kunark? Does the cover foreshadow an event in Kunark that I missed? I ask this because the Velious Expansion seems to tell you that you should not bother with it until you can even get close to killing the dragon on the cover. Can you tell me what the cover shows? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Hammie]</i></font> <br><br>There was a quest that related to that picture. It was a dynamic quest (run by real people playing the NPCs involved) that ran shortly after the Ruins of Kunark was released. This quest will probably never be run again, since it was designed to be part of the story line that lead to the discovery of Kunark. So, unfortunately, you missed it. <br><br>You shouldn't let the cover art on the Velious box make you think that you can't enter Velious without the power to kill a dragon.

Granted, there are lots of sub-stories, and other stories in the world, but I think most people would agree that the real story revolves around the stuff with epic characters and worl-changing consequences. ]</i></font><br><br><br>Ok, I'll admit that. :)<br><br>But I disagree a bit. While those quests do lead to world altering events, they aren't really the 'story' of the game. While some folks do get involved in those events, and they become part of the story of their character's life on Norrath, for some these events are tales not reality. To me, at least, the real story involves my characters. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: <br>Apostrophe problems in the Subject again =)...just for note. <br><br>One thing that I've always wondered about concerning the "dynamic" nature of EverQuest, the ever evolving storyline, and the variations between Servers, etc. <br><br>Now, I understand that there are some storylines that come up dynamically that cross all the servers (like the Dark Elven war that changed the face of Kithicor). My Cleric has sniffed out another brewing in the Karanas (tremendously well done, BTW :), and smells the work of the foul Bertoloxxus behind it. Those seem to also coincide with big product releases, and that's a very cool thing as well. <br><br>But, beyond those, it does not seem that the world of Norrath is particularly dynamic in nature (at least not to any lasting extent), nor does it seem that servers have their own specific individual "character" by and large. <br><br>Here's what I mean, for the most part, no matter how monumental the efforts of a group of players, no permanent effect can ever be had upon the face of Norrath. That's expected, due to the "Everlasting" nature of its inhabitants. Still, you run into a roadblock "as a character" trying to write the story when you realize the static nature of the environs. <br><br>What I do wonder about is the "power" that a lead GM for a particular server might have in suggesting a change to his/her world. In other words, if a GM decided one day that he wanted pirates to have swarmed over the Ogre/Aviak island in Timorous Deep, and have "taken over" the Ogre outpost there. What power would they have to (even for a short time) have someone change the spawns there so that Pirates spawned there instead? I understand that there could be severe technical limitations to this...but it would open the possibilities of characters being able to effect a "change" upon their world. <br><br>For example, let's say that a Guild of Followers of Marr declared a crusade (much like the Pirates above). Let's say they staged a fantastically successful raid, and kept the island cleared of Ogres for a full week (real time). Let's say that in the course of this, the GM's ran an event where the Ogres tried to take the island back, and failed. The GM would then have the option of effecting a "permanent change" on the island to change it around. The world would be dynamic, and a change would have been made on that individual server. <br><br>I know the kind of nightmarish changes this would cause programatically, and I understand how difficult the patch process might be to try and keep up with it. What I might suggest, however, would be the possibility of localizing this to a special server (Perhaps even a RolePlaying server? Hmmmm? Sorry, had to get that in :)) <br><br>Call it a "Dynamic Storyline" server if you like, and give the GM's license to do anything they wanted to effect the storyline. Restrict them to rules that they have to coincide with the "global" storylines, and give them a specific list of things they can do to the environment at different levels. Use the current event structure as a guideline, but take the kid gloves off. Let the GM's play Gods, smite down characters for no reason, create general havoc in their world, even without the "world" being affected. Let them do anything necessary (even destroying character's items, changing religions, heck, change a character's SEX if it takes that). Let them submit changes to the world based on story, and schedule some programmer time to do them. Keep the patching scheme on a different line than the main program (much like the Test Server is done today). <br><br>Obviously, it's a pretty bold step, but it's something to consider strongly for EverQuest II (The Second Story), or any other MMORPG that you guys might design. It might even be a way to spur on interest when your "next big thing" starts to take away from the EQ player-base. <br><br>All just suggestions, as usual, take them as ye will... <br><br>-Zekestrom of the Many Names ]</i></font><br><br>Heads will role&#8230; er&#8230; roll! <br><br>I've no idea why those apostrophes are such a nightmare. I'll hassle someone about it. <br><br>Unfortunately, maintaining completely different data for each server would be as much of a nightmare as you imply. <br><br>I certainly would love to play in a world such as you describe. But many people wouldn't. There are a lot of EverQuest players that do not like the idea of allowing a GM to 'smite down' their characters, from on high or from below, with or without reason. <br><br>And even if this were to happen on a single server it would require a ton of resources. One GM can only entertain so many people at one time, after all. Writing up, testing and coding changes to a zone (even the ones that might seem simple enough) is time consuming. The awesome thing going on now regarding the plague has taken several people a lot of time to conceive, code and build. They deserve a ton of credit for it, it's a great event. But it's a time consuming process.</UL>

I read up on the manuals before I started playing, and in game I talked to each and every NPC, looking for quests, and the history of the world to immerse myself into it. <br><br>The one thing I never found, after 2 years of searching, is the story. I know the history of Norrath, but I just can't find the story of Everquest. <br><br>Maybe it's me, so maybe someone can help me find the story of Everquest? In particular, what's the plot of Everquest and who/what is/are the protaganist(s) and antagonist(s). <br><br>Afterall, every roleplaying game has a story, or there wouldn't be any roles to play. <br><br>HELP! <br><br>Aloran Al`Aan - The Lost One<br>Tunare Server ]</i></font><br><br>The history of EverQuest is our job to convey. As the world builders, we set the setting and prop up the props. <br><br>But as for the story of the game as it exists today, that's mostly up to you all to write. What happens on Norrath in the current days is motivated primarily by the actions of player characters. The story of EverQuest is what happened to your group last night in Unrest. The tales of EverQuest are told around the water cooler in your office the next day as you relive the battles and travels of the weekend with your friends. The epics of Norrath are written in long drawn out e-mail conversations with your guild members. <br><br>Obviously there are restrictions to your ability as a player to tell your own tale, limitations based on the technology that restricts us and the game world. You can't burn the tavern down in a moment of drunken panic. You can't permanently remove Emperor Crush and replace him yourself (after all, you're far more handsome). <br><br>But, barring these limitations, the story of EverQuest is written by the players. <br><br>Bring life to your characters, and you bring life to Norrath. <br><br>I know, I sound a bit like a commercial there, but that's what we have in mind.

I currently play with a DE Wizard and a Barbarian Shaman. My high elf cleric, Tavari, is attempting to reform this wizard, and is under the delusion that he's harmless. Of course, this is aided by the fact that he acts a bit loony at times with her. He get's drunk and has a tendency to cast grav flux way too much. The shaman and the wizard despise each other, and spend most of the time hurling insults at each other. Shaman refusing to sow or heal the wizard, the wizard refusing to teleport the shaman or "accidently" leaving him behind. <br><br>Now, when this same DE Wizard is teaching Tav's younger sister (Talys) the ways of wizardry, all apearancing of bumbling drunken sot are gone. He is far more sinister, uncaring and cold when he's with the younger sister. Talys will never be able to reveal his true nature to her sister either - unless she's okay with her sister finding out she switched allegiances and now worships Solusek Ro. <br><br>Point to all of this is that I LOVE when we are all together playing roles and laughing our butts off. *smile* I never thought I could role play - I've never played Dungeons and Dragons or anything else. The barbarian insists he has no imagination and doesn't know how to role play. If we try to make it "formal" and call it "role playing" he gets all nervous. On te other hand, I know he's not entirely like his barbarian in real life. <br><br>Roleplaying is what makes the game exciting :)<br><br>Tavari - 45 Cleric<br>Guardians of Honor<br>Test Server ]</i></font><br><br>Woot! <br><br>Joegorde wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: But secondly was that I was wondering why it would be that people would be as likely to understand what a Vulcan speaks like as they would speaking like a Scottsman <br><br>Duh Absor, your subscribers are computer geeks.

Fresh from the Developer's Corner is today's edition of the Abosr Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000107.html"><b>Reinstallation Tip</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Addendum: if you choose to back up all the files in EQ to a separate directory, remember to updated those files after each patch (copy the files into the backup directory and click "Yes to All" to overwrite all the files...)gotta keep things current, right? <br><br>Doing this will also save you from the HOURS of download if you should have to reinstall. <br><br>Sigfried99 ]</i></font><br><br>Good point. Thanks for the tip.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000114.html"><b>Newbie Zone</b></a><br>[Note from News Editor: The first part of this infobit was written by Gordon Wrinn] Some may have already noticed that the "The Newbie Zone" and "Customer Service / Tech Help" forums are back in the index and each contain one post. <br><br>If you haven't been there to read that rules post yet and forsee yourself ever posting in these forums, I suggest that you do now. We put the post up on Friday and intend to reopen those forums today for posting. The moderator will be strictly enforcing the rules in order to keep those forums from turning into another "General Discussion". <br><br>I suggest you go read them. <br>Here's the URL to the forum index: <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true</a> <br>--<br>The Tech Support and Newbie Zone message boards are fully functional again. <br><br>Two points of order. <br><br>Yes, all of the old messages are gone. I'm sorry for the good information that you'll have to recreate. I understand the 'throwing out the baby with the bath water' idea. I suspect the good information will return quickly, though, because the community on those two boards has always been great. <br><br>Speaking of bad information&#8230; We are going to be very strict on those message boards. Read the guidelines and follow them. We want those boards to be useful as they were in the past.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000104.html"><b>Patch Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think you misunderstood what Azmira was trying to say. Instead of tracking window placement for each inventory slot (the way it is now), he was recommending tracking window placement for the first bag opened and the second bag opened. <br><br>Since we can only open two bags at once, I think this makes alot of sense. Please consider this idea. <br><br>Gilgurth ]</i></font><br><br>I sure did. I get it now. <br><br>I'll pass it on. Thanks for clearing that up. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I really like the new right click loot feature for corpses - it saves quite a bit of time. however, I've noticed that if I loot a monster's corpse and have a slot that will fit an item it has, I end up equipping that item. <br><br>For instance, my warrior currently has no ranged-slot item, so every time I loot a FS dagger it ends up in the ranged slot. <br><br>Would it be possible to turn off this new feature for monster corpses, and have it apply only to player corpses? <br><br>Nathan ]</i></font><br><br>Well that's pretty much how it's supposed to work. If you can equip the item and you right-click in from the loot screen, you equip it. Moving it from the range slot is going to be no more or less time consuming than the old method of looting (faster, really). And it's most certainly better than the old way if you're in a hurry.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000115.html"><b>Fan Faire Coverage</b></a><br>The Fan Faire site has our coverage of the latest San Diego Fan Faire up.

Cast heal, hit assist again which puts me back on Velk, hit it again to target the tank he's hitting, repeat. <br><br>With this method clerics/druids/shaman can heal non-group members quickly during raids. ]</i></font><br><br>And that will still work. Just take the %t out of your macro. You don't need it, and it won't work in there anymore.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Agnostic Iksar</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm not sure which thread this would go under better, so I'll... ahem... put it under both :)<br><br>I was reading the Agnostic Iksar thread, I was reminded of an old MUD I used to play (it's still around actually). One of the things you could do in that game was donate valuables and cash to your guild (equivalent to class in EQ). At regular intervals, the game totalled up the donations for that interval, and whichever guild had the highest donations would receive a small boon to their abilities (though the exact quantities of the bonus were not revealed). <br><br>Anyway, my idea is to allow donations of some sort to your deity. Donations could include cash or items; items would be valued at their nominal merchant-sold price, i.e., the lowest price for which a merchant would sell the item to a player character. After some interval - weekly, perhaps - the donations would be tallied and divided by some normalization factor (so the very few worshippers of Veeshan would have the opportunity to compete with the fifteen gazillion worshippers of Brell), and the followers of the leading deity would gain a small bonus of some sort for that period. If you like, you can also make that deity ineligible for the next one or few intervals, to give more people a shot at the bonus. <br><br>It requires far less balance concerns than a permanent bonus to abilities based on deity, and it has the added bonus of removing cash and the glut of equipment from the economy. <br><br>Who knows, it might even work, if adjusted just right :)<br><br>Nizanko Seigikan]</i></font> <br><br>Interesting idea. The two birds with one stone thing always appeals to me. <br><br>I've passed it on to the team, as usual. Other than that, the only thing I have to say is that it's an interesting idea. And I've already said that twice&#8230;</UL>

Dynamite brought us this event update:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail good people of Norrath!<br><br>    Again, I come before you today with news of Fennin Ro's Wizard<br>Faire! This Faire shall be the first of its kind, where wizards of all<br>levels come together to have fun. We shall have games, contests, duels,<br>prizes, and on top of it all, our monthly Rune Trade!<br><br>    For those who do not know, in past months I have hosted a wizard<br>Rune Trade on Fennin Ro. Wizards of all levels came together with their<br>runes and helped each other: if there was a rune you needed that someone<br>had, you would ask and it would likely be given to you. Subsequently, if<br>you had a rune another wizard needed that you didn't, it was expected<br>that you would offer it to your fellow wizard in order to further his or<br>her own advancement. Several higher level wizards also offered their<br>time and skills in research to the cause, ensuring their lower level<br>comrades were able to get their spells.<br><br>    This month, the trade is still on. However, on top of that, we will<br>be having several contests and games just for fun, some of which will<br>have prizes for the winners! As this is an effort put forth by the<br>community, as a member of the community you are welcome, and even<br>expected, to lend your assistance. If you have ideas for games (we<br>ALWAYS need these), prizes or money for prizes you would like to donate<br>to the faire, or any questions, please feel free to e-mail me at<br><br>fenninrunes@hotmail.com<br><br>or contact me in-game.<br><br>    If you are making a donation, I would ask that you please hold on to<br>it until the Faire, but please let me know that you intend to donate it.<br>This way I can schedule the games around the prizes, making sure the<br>appropriate prizes are awarded for the appropriate games and contests.<br>Also, if you are not able to attend, but have runes or prizes you would<br>like to be at the Faire, then please give them to a wizard friend who<br>intends to attend. On that note, be sure to tell all your friends! The<br>Faire schedule is currently:<br><br>Fennin Ro Server<br>Toxxullia Spires<br>Saturday 28th April<br>Begins: 2PM PST (5PM EST)<br>Ends: when it's over! =)<br><br>    The trade itself shall begin when attendance has peaked, so the more<br>people you bring with you, the faster we can begin trading. Also, I am<br>only one brewer, and in past months, I have had JUST enough of my fare<br>to please the attendants of the trade. If you are a tradesperson and<br>would like to bring some of your stock to the Faire, no matter what it<br>is (baked goods, alcohol, anything!) then you are more than welcome...<br>just remember to save yourself for the drinking contest!<br><br>    Thank you my fellow wizards of Fennin Ro, for being such a wonderful<br>community and making this possible. When we stand together like this, we<br>truly shine in every way. It is you that makes the Faire, and the Faire<br>is magnificent. I look forward to seeing you all there!<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.
