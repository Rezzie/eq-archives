I'm starting to receive reports that the Scars of Velious has been spotted at retail stores across the country.  For those who didn't preorder it your best bets are to stop by Software, Etc., Best Buy, Circuit City and other similar vendors.<br><br>I'll try stopping by my local software source to see if the anticipated expansion has even reached the "rural" areas of the country. ;)

Brad McQuaid made several comments about the Scars of Velious expansion recently on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037021.html">a thread located on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><I>Just letting everyone know that Scars of Velious should start to appear in US stores tomorrow, and be in most stores by the end of the week. <br><br>I'm not sure about outside of the US, but we do have much better distribution now. I'll try to find out. <br><br>-Brad <br><br>ps. If you have any Velious sightings, feel free to post them on this thread :)</i></UL>Follow-up post #1:<UL><i>For those in San Diego, remember the team will be at the EB in UTC on Wednesday to say hi, sign boxes, give away posters, etc. <br><br>See you there :)<br><br>And stevemorley, yep, I've been shown quite a tour through the varous zones in Velious, and it's pretty darn amazing stuff :)  I think the teams have really outdone themselves this time. <br><br>For example, I'm really happy to see traps! (Especially after having so many Rogues upset with me for so long :)<br><br>Also, wow, are there some great stories and quests! We've seen a lot of posts asking for more stories, more RP, and more depth... well, Velious is a HUGE step forward in that direction -- there are all sorts of new scripted events involving players and NPCs using some advanced AI enchancements we managed to get implemented. <br><br>I can't wait to hear what you all think :)<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>Here's follow-up post #2:<UL><i>Tiervalen: Essentially, the majority of our player base is heading into their 30s, and with the backstory of Velious describing it as a pretty nasty and exotic place, we decided to make the expansion targetted for levels 35-60. <br><br>One could also argue that new players and casual players (for the sake of argument, those below 35 I suppose) still, by definition, have tons of already existing content to explore and devour. <br><br>All that said, I definitely hear what you're saying and it's also a concern on our part (we definitely want to provide new content for ALL EQ players, new or old, casual or hard core, RPers or power gamers) To that end, we've both short and long term goals: <br><br>We still have quite a few dungeons to revamp, and those include low, mid and high (including the planes). With Velious in stores tomorrow, you'll see the Expansion and Live teams move on pretty quickly to these revamps (although there will undoubtedly be some clean up and we do have the holidays approaching). <br><br>Also, I'd like to see at least one (perhaps two) new free zones launch during 2001, and I think we should focus on low to mid levels. <br><br>And lastly, should there be another expansion post-Velious (and while I'm certainly not announcing anything... well, with 310,000 subscribers and growing, I see a long future ahead of EQ :), we'll most likely target all levels (1-60), similar to what we did with Kunark. <br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

Brad quickly responded to a post concerning the status of MIP Mapping.  The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037080.html">following is his complete response</a>:<UL><I>With the last patch (or maybe the one before that), we decided to turn off mip mapping for everything but the world (in other words, it's not on for characters and objects).<br><br>We did this because mip mapping all those textures was causing performance problems and pauses for many players. That, and we really think subjectively that the advantages of mip mapping are for the most part apparent and beneficial only on world geometry.<br><br>That said, you seem to disagree. We'd love to hear some other feedback on this. Perhaps we could provide several options (for example, no mip mapping, mip mapping world only, mip mapping all textures) were there a demand. <br><br>Let us know, and maybe Rowyl can look into it and let us know if such options are possible.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>

Right now the suggestion is to drag that window out of the way as much as possible before closing it. That's for now. We're fixing it so that the box will go away properly as soon as we can. <br><br>We're also aware of the second bug too. You won't lose them money, it's still in a buffer someplace. It will come back when you zone or log back in. We're fixing that one too.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036843.html"><b>Using "Nazi" to Describe People</b></a><br>Ok everyone, enough. <br><br>Let's stop using 'nazi' to describe anyone here. It's a very offensive choice of terminology. Consider doing so worthy of a warning from here on out. I have no problem with people talking about our policies, even if you don't like them. But using terminology that is designed only to offend people like this is something that I'm not going to allow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036852.html"><b>Corpse Dragging</b></a><br>Airtreader wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Sigh, your not seeing the picture Vi has dancing in their tiny brains.<br>player dies in some $oV zone, cant recover corpse.<br>necro and player zone in, necro targets player, summons corpse.<br>necro is summoned to the feet of 5-6 dragons, chewed up and spit out. ]</i></font><br><br>I pretty much count on that as being how it happens.

The troops were gathered in Cabilis and much sparring and <br>excitement was built within the arena.  At 3PM PST/ 6PM EST the call to <br>arms was given and the 7th Legion was met at the large statue some distance <br>from Cabilis.  Each guild lined up across from each other and finally the <br>signal was given<br><br>Each guild fought hard but the numerical superiority of the Iksar was too <br>great for the brave adventurers from the Other Continents.  Both guild <br>leaders were slain and much blood, Iksar and fleshy filled the soil.  In <br>the end the sole 7th Legion member surviving had to flee.  Afterward there <br>was much congratulations on both sides for a clean fun event.

Here are the latest posts from Alan from off of the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035745-2.html"><b>Titanic-sized Mage Issue Response</b></a><br>I'm sorry it took me so long to respond to this post. It's taken me three days just to write this response. It's been pretty busy in here&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How was Unbreakable, Absor?]</i></font> <br><br>Never managed to see it&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Sword of Runes]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for seeing that as a fix. I do. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Call of the Hero <br><br>However, Verant has said that the aggro will not be cleared all the time. This has interesting effects: <br><br>1) The groupmate will be pulled out of the situation, but likely still in danger. Since the groupmate may still be on the hate list, the mob may give chase or summon the groupmate back.]</i></font> <br><br>Yup <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) The mage and groupmate can use CoH to pull a mob they otherwise could not pull. <br><br>It's this last one that's interesting to me. Does Verant realize that this change will give groups with CoH-equipped mages the ability to pull big mobs more easily? I think clearing the hate list is the right thing to do. The mob believes the player to have gated, unless the summoned player is within the normal aggro range of the mob.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, it could be used that way, I suppose. But the chance of the hate list not being cleared is supposed to be pretty low&#8230; it might be faster to pull it the normal way. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And thanks for fixing the pet suicide!]</i></font> <br><br>For you, anything. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Spell Skill Class<br><br>-----------------<br>I see Verant continuing the evocation path with magicians. This is disheartening. We are conjurers. Let the wizards have their evocation. Long ago I asked GZ why spells like "Rain of Spikes" were evocation. His answer? Paraphrase: "It was likely a mistake, but we can't change it now since people may have based their specialization on it being evocation." Sigh, I went to magician school. Mages should conjure heavy and sharp flying objects rather than rely on fire so heavily IMHO. Why are so many of our spells (with Kunark and current Velious spells) fire-based?]</i></font> <br><br>Umm&#8230; I dunno? I'm, again, not really going to comment about Velious spells. But from reading the &#8211; oh so excellent &#8211; Prima Strat Guide, it does suggest that magicians should either specialize in conjuration or in evocation, and that many mages choose evocation. <br><br>Is that really how it should be? I dunno. But GZ is right about it being a little late to change horses mid-stream. I'll mention this comment to the folks here and let them think about it, though for whatever is in Velious it's likely too late to fiddle with that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Rain Spells<br>------------<br>Why do things that can't be affected by these spells reduce their effectiveness? I'm a magician...I'm going to have a pet up nearly all the time. Why is it that the rain loses a wave to my pet when my pet can't be harmed by the rain? Our rain spells are efficient only when all waves have a chance to hit. We pay for that efficiency with a resistance check on each wave and the risks of aggroing more mobs with its AE nature. Totally losing a wave on our pet makes these spells mana inefficient and is one of the main reasons they are not more heavily used. If you can't "fix" the pet problem, would you consider making the rain spells target only rather than AE? Again, the resistance checks on each wave should balance the spells.]</i></font> <br><br>It's just as easy to argue the other way, that pets should be damaged because they are obviously being hit by the spell&#8230; <br><br>The real way to look at this is from the game mechanic point of view. Is having the pet take a wave making the spell too weak? Would making him not hit make the spell too strong? Honestly, I don't know. I do plan to bring this up, but probably not until after the holidays. I know that's not fast enough, but it's as fast as it's gonna happen. Verant deserves a holiday too&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: PBAoE<br>-----<br>Thanks for Scintilation! I love frying those undead lowbies that think they can gang up and melee me into the ground. This spell isn't useful for things my level, but if it were, it'd overpower the class.]</i></font> <br><br>Cool. Thanks. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: DOT Spells<br>----------<br>I know, you won't talk about Velious...But with the CD gold and the release around the corner, I thought you might speak a little more on the tpoc. Why are we getting weak DOTs? I'm not a shaman or necro. I don't want to waste mana and time on a DOT when I could do the same or more damage instantly. <br><br>The tradeoff for DOTs is typically more damage, for more time. More time, same damage makes no sense to me. Shamans can debuff a mob to lengthen the fight, giving their DOT time to work. Necros can fear a mob, giving their DOT time to work. Magicians have no means of lengthening a fight other than to cast more slowly. In fact, the longer a fight continues, the worse shape magicians are in, typically. <br><br>Please, reconsider DOTs...or make them more powerful for the trade off of time.]</i></font> <br><br>Umm&#8230; Let's wait on this. I'm really, really not talking about Velious stuff. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Fun Spells<br>----------<br>Bristlebane's Bundle...ah...what a fun spell! Seriously, having a summoned party pack is great! (You'd be surprised how many high levels I've tricked into spinning themselves with the bottle, heh). A few Velious spells like this would be great! In fact, as the DOTs are currently listed, take them all away. Give us things we can have fun with...Voice Graft, anyone?]</i></font> <br><br>I'm all for fun spells too. I'm one of those people that tends to buy the fun spells first and worry about combat spells later. Eye of Zomm rocks! Again, I'll make this suggestion to the team, but it's probably too late to make any changes to Velious (I know, it might not have been when you first posted&#8230;) <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Pet Graphics<br>------------<br>Rage of Zomm: Make it an eye...please? It would be something different to look at that fits the Zomm line. We can't hand the Rage weapons anyway, so why make it an elemental? Eyes are in the global file already, right?]</i></font> <br><br>Very good idea. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: High Level Elementals: We were told that there was no room in the global file. Sorry, mages. Spectres yes, new elementals no. Ok, fine. Now there's 3 more gods in the global file that I have yet to see in game. I guess gods have to be able to go to any zone. Ok, fine. Sigh.]</i></font> <br><br>Also a nice idea. I have no idea how much space there is (or isn't) for new globals. I do know that enchanters want some new stuff too. Both ideas are on my list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Linkdeath<br>---------<br>Absor was incorrect in stating that it has always been the way it is now. In fact, it was changed when it was discovered that people were banking summoned arrows and food...or forcing linkdeath to save it (oh my!). I do not believe that I should be able to summon the equivalent of dragon loot (a Treasure Hunter's Satchel, for example). But really, did a few banked summoned items throw off the game balance? <br><br>My inference is that Verant would rather punish all magicians and shaman 100% of the time than risk a few percent of players who are willing to linkdeath themselves to save summoned items. Isn't there a solution that meets both ends? You've already prevented summoned items from being banked. Put code into the /q and camp commands that trashes summoned items in a player's inventory and leave it at that. If someone is willing to physically disconnect a wire or reboot their machine in the middle of an EQ session to save some arrows, let them! Or consider this option: make it a 10% chance that things will poof on linkdeath...that will prevent people from using the summoned bags to lug around all their good loot, yet give us a fair shot at keeping our items most of the time.]</i></font> <br><br>There have been several suggestions for changes to the way linkdeath works with summoned items. Again, it's on my list. Hopefully after the holidays we'll be able to tackle my growing list&#8230;<br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Elemental Pets<br>--------------<br>Earth and Air: Nice! Thanks!]</i></font> <br><br>Yer weclome. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Water: I wish I could say. Are you sure the drop has been fixed for 54 Water?]</i></font> <br><br>So I have been told. But I haven't taken it off my list yet&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Fire: Argh! A 52 and 58 pet that casts low level spells, cancels debuffs, has a newbie fire shield, gates and can't melee to save its life or mine? Verant has told us that we just haven't found the right use for this pet. I'd bet I've logged more magician hours than ANY Verant staffer, but perhaps I'm just dumb. Please, please, please. Take a serious look at this pet! I don't know any magician who would take the current pet over the existing, properly buffed 49 and under pet model.]</i></font> <br><br>Also on my list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Power of Pets: We've been told that our pets are more powerful than ever thanks to the DW bug fix a year ago. What Verant fails to mention is that fire, air and water now hit as slowly as earth. The differences in attack speed is now gone. Fire dished out more damage before, allowing it to finish fights faster than earth, now it doesn't. The differences in pets was narrowed greatly by this silent nerf. Just a point to make that pet variety got narrower. Narrower is bad.]</i></font> <br><br>Are you talking about the supposed 'nerf' that was supposed to have happened last week? I hate to repeat myself, but there wasn't one&#8230; The reduction of the procing will certainly make pets a bit weaker, even with the dual wielding change. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Decoy Pet<br>---------<br>This pet doesn't seem to be much of a decoy. As has been pointed out, it doesn't taunt very well. The whole point behind this pet is to get mobs to lock onto it! It should do that or it won't be useful.]</i></font> <br><br>On my list now (I'm sure you're tired of hearing that by now). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Rage of Zomm<br>------------<br>This pet is interesting. It's at least some variety, although I'm convinced that Zomm was a sissy mage that died at an early age. I wish this thing could survive more than a single ripostle. Would you consider increasing it's health? Give it half the health of an elemental. It is not dishing out twice as much damage as an elemental, so this would not seem to overpower the pet. If not, would you consider lowering the casting time to 2 seconds? Yes, 2 seconds. This would allow us a chance at summoning a pet to distract something that's beating us...even if not for very long.]</i></font> <br><br>Again, I'll bring it up. I'm not familiar with this pet, so I'll talk to someone about it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Summoned Items<br>--------------<br>"Well, one man's junk..." is a newbie's dream? Nope. It's junk to most newbies too. The Sword of Runes is unqiue because of its proc. Other summons that proc that level of damage would be awesome! It'd give me options. I don't want to summon weapons that make warriors drool. What about weapons that proc a small DoT? Weapons whose proc is a serious taunt? Weapons that make wood elf women rain down from the sky?]</i></font> <br><br>It may be a little while before we start talking about new procing summoned weapons. I'll certainly let you all know when we get to it, I'll probably ask for ideas. <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Pet Heals<br>---------<br>I wish we had them when I was low enough for them to matter. They really added some dimension to the class. Why not give us a high level heal? I can resummon a pet in 10 - 12 seconds at 51+. Let me CH my own pet in 10 seconds for 500 mana. That's a lot of mana...more than a cleric's CH (and of course, limited to the pet). Now I have a choice. With 500 mana do I DD, try to summon a new pet or heal my own?]</i></font> <br><br>Sounds interesting. Again, it's on my list&#8230; (yikes) <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Buffs & Stuff<br>-------------<br>Invisibility: Why didn't magicians get improved invisibility? Normally, we get what other casters get with the exception of things like root and stun for which we must rely on pets. However, my pets don't invis me (thankfully, since they'd become despondent and suicide).]</i></font> <br><br>Er&#8230; that's a Velious thing&#8230; but my answer would be, I don't know&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Phantom Armor: Woot! Finally, a reason for casting it! Now, two things...can you make it use one of something 4 times as expensive as the agate? No? What about one of something 10 times as expensive? I'd prefer that...most magicians 51+ would. Also, why does Sheild of Words overwrite this? If you can't let me have both my Phantom Armor and the cleric Shield of Words, then make Phantom Armor higher on the list so the cleric gets "Your spell did not take hold" -- I hate losing my armor to well meaning clerics.]</i></font> <br><br>You mean you want it to cost more? I don't know the current cost, so perhaps you're being sarcastic (and I hate missing good sarcasm&#8230; :)  Again, I'll ask about the stacking on this spell, and the cost, once I figure out what you mean&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Epic Quest<br>----------<br>I need a no drop rare from the Minions of Hate? Ack! The "minion" is an 8-day timed spawn. He'll pop 45 times in a year (slightly more due to servers going down and resetting the timer). The general consensus is that the staff is dropped about 10% of the time. Ouch. Even if I can raise an army and get this minion every time, it will take between 8 and 80 days with the average being in the middle of that just to get this one item. Note the NPC says "minions of Hate" ... was the drop to be moved from where it is to the minions of its current owner?]</i></font> <br><br>I've mentioned this elsewhere. The 'minions' thing is in there in anticipation of possible changes to Hate. Even when (if) it is changed, the minions will not be easier to deal with than the current holder of the item. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I need burning embers from a notable member of wurm kind? Well, eventually this will be found. I hope this really is dropping. There are a lot of people looking for it.]</i></font> <br><br>I hope so too&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In Closing<br>----------<br>I hope you understand that people like me make posts like this because we care about the game. We enjoy playing it and truly want to improve it. I don't want to become Uber. If I did, I'd go back to playing any number of games I can walk all over.]</i></font> <br><br>I do understand. We are all aware that if you really hated the game you wouldn't even be posting here, you'd be playing elsewhere. And I appreciate your feedback. I'm sorry that so many of your suggestions are on my 'list'. I know that sounds like a put-off, and it is kind of. But I will talk with people about these issues. You'll just have to be very patient about it&#8230; I hope that doesn't offend you.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036680-2.html"><b>Corpse Dragging is instant argro in SoV zones?</b></a><br>Ok, here's a bit more information. <br><br>The idea is that there are some places where, with a good faction, characters can travel unharmed. Some of those places are very, very dangerous to those that are not aligned with the folks that live there. These will be major adventuring/hunting zones for those that don&#8217;t mind not being able to wander around free there and talk to the locals. <br><br>We really like it that way, but setting things up like that leads to a simple problem. Folks that are hated by the natives can make assaults on them and have their 'friends' who are well liked by the locals simply drag their corpses to safety, right in front of the people they were trying to kill. There are other potential abuses of this situation that I won't describe&#8230; <br><br>So, to maintain the risk of fighting in these difficult places, we had to have these mobs get upset when you drag their kills off. And, yes, rogues and invisible types will have to be a lot more careful doing their recoveries once they actually lift that corpse up on their shoulders and start to scamper away. <br><br>You will not have a problem dragging your own corpse (at least not any more of a problem than you would normally have). So if you accidentally fall to your death and you are friendly with the natives, you will be able to drag your own corpse all over the zone with no additional problems. But then, you won't need a safe spot either&#8230; <br><br>This will make corpse recovery a little bit more difficult in the few places where this rule is used. But we see this as a necessary and useful inclusion. We wanted to tell you about it before hand to help reduce the number of people surprised by this addition.<br>--<br>Yikes! <br><br>Correction on my last post. <br><br>Dragging a corpse will not make you more visible. So if the creature sees through invis, it will still see you dragging a corpse. If it does not, dragging a corpse will not increase your visibility to that creature. <br><br>Sorry for the goof on that. Hopefully I caught it fast enough.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036913.html"><b>Velious a "Bug-Fix" Add-on?</b></a><br>ProppaT wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "My only gripe is that it's not new content...it's a fix to a bug."]</i></font> <br><br>No, it's new content.

Alan made the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036950.html">following plea for patience</a> on the Gameplay Board this afternoon:<UL><i>Please be patient with us over the next few days. As Velious goes live we are expecting to be very busy, both on the servers and with tech support. We will be doing everything we can to keep things running smoothly for everyone. But if something untoward happens, please understand that our staff will be working hard to help you out. We are anticipating a rather large increase in volume on the servers, in petitions and on our tech support phone lines. Velious is an exciting new adventure for everyone, with people rushing out to see the new lands. Servers will probably see a lot more activity than they are used to, and they already see a lot. So will our customer support personnel. Please, be patient with them during this busy time.<br><br>And happy holidays to everyone!<br><br>Alan</I></UL>

The following updates were added to the manual supplement in a recent update via the Patch Server:<UL>Sense and Disarm Traps<br><br>In addition to rogues, bards, who always had the ability to disarm traps,<br>have gained the ability to sense them as well.  Since we are aware that some<br>may have not bothered training sense or disarm traps due to them formerly<br>being unimplemented, bards and rogues will have the ability to gain skill<br>without training once they have reached the appropriate level and have<br>crossed a zone boundary.<br><br>These skills now have use within Velious.  There are traps, and they range<br>from annoying to deadly throughout Velious.  They are invisible and can only<br>be detected and disarmed by rogues and bard.<br><br>Use &#8220;Sense Traps&#8221; to see if there are any traps in the vicinity.  If so, you<br>can then use &#8220;Disarm traps&#8221; to try and disarm the trap.  Once disarmed, the<br>trap will remain inactive for a short period of time (about a minute) while<br>your group passes through the area.<br><br>If there are multiple traps within range, your attempt to disarm will be<br>directed towards the closest one.<br><br><br>Corpse Dragging in Velious<br><br>Due to the importance of faction within Velious, we wanted to avoid a<br>situation where a group could die in an area, and then easily bring in<br>someone with good faction to drag all of the corpses out without consequence<br>or risk.  As such, there are some zones in Velious where dragging a corpse<br>is considered &#8220;assisting the enemy&#8221; by the inhabitants of the area.  They<br>will react accordingly.<br><br>Same Resolution Looting, Trading, Inspection, and Inventory (Velious Only)<br><br>Previously, when looting, trading, or viewing inventory, the screen would<br>switch to a lower resolution mode (that small UI in the center if you are at<br>resolutions above 640x480).  Now, if you are in resolutions above 640x480,<br>nearly all functions take place in the higher resolution mode.  Functions<br>that currently do not take place in the higher resolution mode will do so in<br>the near future.<br><br>Experience Bar Enhancement<br><br>Players will notice a blue line in their experience bar in addition to the<br>bars.  The blue line is a &#8220;macroview&#8221; of each bubble of experience.  The<br>blue line will fill the entire experience bar for each for each bubble of<br>experience earned.<br><br>The User Interface features new options and screens that allow players to<br>remain in the &#8220;Full Screen&#8221; video mode when playing the game, rather than<br>switching to the lower resolution &#8220;Overlay&#8221; mode.  As a result, the<br>additional windows superimposed on the full screen UI are greater in number<br>and support additional options:<br><br>Positioning<br><br>Windows can now be moved to a location of your preference by clicking on the<br>upper left-hand corner of each window, moving it to a location of your<br>preference, and clicking again to set it into  place.  This option is set on<br>a &#8220;per-resolution&#8221; basis, so you can have different window positions for<br>each resolution.<br><br>Scaling<br><br>The Chat and Spell-effect windows can be scaled in size by clicking on the<br>lower right-hand corner, dragging to the desired size, then clicking again<br>to set the option. This option is set on a &#8220;per-resolution&#8221; basis, so you<br>can have different window scaling for each resolution.<br><br>Enabling / Disabling Windows<br><br>Each window in full screen mode can be enabled or disabled for viewing by<br>engaging the customizable hot-key combination for that feature and window.<br>The defaults are:<br><br>ALT &#8211; B: Buff/Spell Effects Window<br>ALT &#8211; P: Party (Group) Window<br>ALT &#8211; C: Chat Window<br>ALT &#8211; S: Spell Gem Window<br>ALT &#8211; H: Hotbox Window<br>ALT &#8211; T: Target Window<br>ALT &#8211; Y: Self-Status Window<br>ALT &#8211; M: Menu Window<br><br>LoadArmor17 through LoadArmor22 = TRUE or FALSE	(Velious Only)<br><br>Defines whether or not you want to load the new armor implemented with<br>Velious into your video card&#8217;s texture memory.  Players with older video<br>cards may choose to set one or more of these options to FALSE if you<br>experiencing slow framerate or excess swapping when viewing these armors in<br>areas with many textures.<br><br>By default, these are all set to &#8220;FALSE&#8221;, as it is possible that those with<br>lower end systems will have problems when attempting to load all of the new<br>armor files.  At your option, you can switch all or part of them to &#8220;TRUE&#8221;<br>to see the new armor.  If you have problems with framerate or disk swapping,<br>turn all or part of them back to &#8220;FALSE&#8221;.<br><br>As a note, though you may be able to obtain the files and make these entries<br>if you are not Velious-enabled, the new armor will not be displayed unless<br>you are.<br><br>[WindowColors]  (Velious Only)<br><br>This section contains custom color settings for the transparent polygons<br>behind chat and other windows in full-screen mode.  It can be set using the<br>/wincolor command in game.<br><br>Pauses in Social Batches<br><br>You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause<br>takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of<br>tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).<br><br>For example, a social consisting of:<br><br>/sit off<br>/cast 1<br>/pause 100<br>/sit on<br><br>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds<br>after you&#8217;ve STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br><br>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another<br>social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause<br>command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same<br>line.<br><br>For example:<br><br>/sit off<br>/pause 100,/cast 1<br>/sit on<br><br>...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to note<br>that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another,<br>and MUST be specified first on the line.<br><br>General Hybrid Disciplines (All Hybrid Classes)<br><br>RESISTANT (Level 51 &#8211; Velious Only): +3 to all resistances.  This discipline<br>lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour.  The reuse time for<br>this discipline will decrease as you level.<br><br>FEARLESS (Level 54 &#8211; Velious Only): Immunity to &#8220;Fear&#8221; and all spells that<br>cause &#8220;fear&#8221;.  This discipline lasts for 11 seconds, and has a base reuse<br>time of 1 hour.  The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you<br>level.<br><br><br>Paladin Disciplines<br><br>HOLYFORGE (Level 55 &#8211; Velious Only): Critical Hits and Crippling Blows<br>versus undead.  This discipline lasts for 2 minutes, and has a base reuse<br>time of 72 minutes.<br><br>SANCTIFICATION (Level 60 &#8211; Velious Only): Immunity to most types of harmful<br>spells.  This discipline lasts for 10 seconds, and has a base reuse time of<br>72 minutes.<br><br>Shadowknight Disciplines<br><br>UNHOLYAURA (Level 55 &#8211; Velious Only): 25% increase to damage done by<br>Harmtouch.  This discipline has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.<br><br>LEECHCURSE (Level 60 &#8211; Velious Only): Heal self for every point of melee<br>damage dealt while discipline is active.  This discipline lasts for 15<br>seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.<br><br><br>Ranger Disciplines<br><br>TRUESHOT (Level 55 &#8211; Velious Only): Max to two times max bow damage.  This<br>discipline lasts for 2 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.<br><br>WEAPONSHIELD (Level 60 &#8211; Velious Only): Parry all melee attacks.

The big <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/magazine/issues/001204/">TV Guide article on gaming</a> has hit the newsstands and the net.  EverQuest is featured in three collectable covers along with Tomb Raider and a Skate Board game.  Here's the EverQuest version of the cover:<UL><b><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/tvguide.jpg">EverQuest TV Guide Cover</A></B></UL>  Lastly, here's a quote from the actual article:<UL><b>EverQuest: Scars of Velious</b> (Verant) <b>PC</b> The granddaddy of them all: 300,000 players adventure online in a massive fantasy world.

Alan dropped by the boards twice today to say the following:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036440-2.html"><b>Name Changes, Part I</b></a><br>If you want to discuss our name policies, I'm all for it. But not with the kind of language and name calling that has been used in this thread.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481.html"><b>Name Changes, Part II</b></a><br>I'm sorry that the name changes bother you so much. But it's not as though we've hidden the rules about naming characters. It is unfortunate that names breaking the rules remain in the game so long, and therefore the players get attached to them. But the rules are pretty clear, and we do our best to stick by our rules as tightly as we can. And those rules have existed since the game was opened, not thirty days into it. <br><br>Again, I'm sorry if the name changes upset anyone, but we're pretty firm about it and we think that it adds a lot to the game to have charactes with names that fit the setting.</UL>

This is the Saturday Edition of the Absor Infobits:<uL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036149.html"><b>More Pet Clarification</b></a><br>Hi. <br><br>We looked over all the details about pets (again). <br><br>For example, in order to make a sweeping change to pet stats someone would have to change the data for every individual pet (and there are dozens of them). If something like that were done on purpose it would take a lot of time, it would never be an accident. If it happened accidentally, it would probably have had to happen by some sort of software glitch, and would have probably happened to every NPC. Regardless, we looked at the stats, they are all the same as they were pre-patch. <br><br>We looked over the code that determines how the pet acts, its attacks and all of that. It's all just as it was pre-patch. We checked it over, summoned pets and looked at their stats, how they fought&#8230; Nothing has changed. <br><br>But, as of Monday we will be making one small change to something that has always happened. Some spells could summon pets both under and over 35th level. Pets 36th level and over are more powerful than those of 35th and under. We didn't like the idea that pets summoned with one spell would range so greatly in their power. So we've set it up so that such spells will only summon pets over 35th level. This is, obviously, a small increase in the power of those particular spells. But I want to stress that this will be completely new as of Monday. Pets have always had that level range problem. This is one of those fixes that comes of careful scrutiny of a situation like this. So some good has come of all this. <br><br>I don't know that there is much more I can say. <br><br>I ask you all to keep in mind that your pets were procing more than they were before, and that they could proc even on a miss. Keep in mind that your pet levels can vary greatly with each summon. Pets will have to fight longer without procing weapons, so they may seem to be more vulnerable&#8230; <br><br>We've looked over everything, and we found nothing wrong in the programming. <br><br>I have a few e-mails from mages telling me that they've seen no change with the exception of the procing (and see the improvement from the auto-dual wield ability). Please, take a step back and look at your pet again.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036222.html"><b>Pets and Procs</b></a><br>No non-weapon procs were changed at all on any pets.<br>--<br>I meant to be firm. No intended, no maybes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036246.html"><b>Tab Button Trouble</b></a><br>Tab should only target you when you do not have the chat window open. With the chat window active it should cycle between the people that last sent you tells. <br><br>You shouldn't have too much trouble using that in combat.</UL>

Last night a new message went up on the EQ Patch Server:<UL>December 1st, 7:00pm<br>------------------------------<br><br>*SBLive Soundcards and Hardware Acceleration*<br><br>Due to some past problems with SBLive cards, users of those cards who called into tech support were asked to turn "Hardware Acceleration" down one notch in DXDIAG.  The last patch corrected those problems and most users should again increase hardware acceleration to maximum.  <br><br>To do this:<br><br>1. Click "Start"<br>2. Click "Run"<br>3. Type "DXDIAG.EXE" and press enter.<br>4. Click on the "Sound" tab.<br>5. Increase the "Hardware Acceleration" slider to maximum.<br><br>Doing this should correct issues such as not hearing certain sounds or sound volume disparities.  <br><br>The only users who may not want to do this are Windows 2000 users.  Creative Labs is currently working on new drivers for Win2K, so you may wish to wait until these drivers are completed prior to increasing hardware acceleration.<br><br>Finally, all SBLive users should get LiveWare 3.0 from <a href="http://www.soundblaster.com/liveware/.">http://www.soundblaster.com/liveware/.</a>  After installing LiveWare, you will then want to REINSTALL the latest drivers for your sound card.

Brad McQuaid added his comments to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035877.html">yesterday's thread</a> focusing on a variety of EQ issues including nerfs: <UL><i>I do recall replying to AuntieShaynta publicly quite some time ago, stating that it was still our intent to implement Enchanters enchanting items, but that such plans were still very much in the planning stages and considered long term. <br><br>And I stand by it -- I still think we'll see that one day (and given our desire to pretty much freeze class balancing, it will probably be one of the last significant class enchancements). But hey, never say never :)  Consider traps :)<br><br>Also, if I recall correctly, item enchantment was also talked about in earlier pre-release (probably pre-beta, but I'm not certain) FAQs, but I later had it removed (along with guildhouses, lycanthropy, vampirism, etc.) It simply was one of the few features we'd planned on but didn't have time to deliver on. <br><br>It does trouble me a little that even though I try to be clear about whether something is short term, or long, or something we're only thinking about, etc. that it often turns into a 'promise' over time... but I guess that's unavoidable. It's a form of the 'telephone game' quite often, where one person hears that we said one thing, and then they tell somebody else, and the message sort of evolves from there :)<br><br>Just to let you all know, there are still a TON of things we want to add to EQ, and we feel EQ has a very long life ahead of it. For example, although it's too early to say much, I will say that we've got some VERY big plans post-Velious. <br><br>And Tera, wow... not sure what to say :(  I certainly do my best to live up to my word. Again, though, some times things I talk about as something planned evolve somehow into 'promises'... And then some things I hopefully characterized as 'long term' are still just that: long term plans that haven't happened yet. <br><br>All things considered I'm very proud of our track record and just how much of the game we talked about pre-release game into fruition. And I'm also very proud of where the live and expansion teams have taken the game post-release. IMHO, EQ is almost everything we'd planned it to be and a whole lot more. <br><br>-Brad</i></UL>
