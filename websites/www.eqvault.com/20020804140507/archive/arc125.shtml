Gordon Wrinn responded on the Gameplay board to a post about some of Verant's policies.  Here's the thread:<UL>Abashi could you please justify Verant's guilty until proven innocent policy? <b><i><P>That's not our policy at all. Our policy could better be defined as "Neutral until proven one way or the other". If someone is "proven guilty", then they are frequently removed from our customer-base. If they are "proven innocent", they'll usually get a reimbursement. <P>The best analogy for this type of operation would probably be a bank. </b></i><P>Why do you choose to ruin the play experience of honest people to prevent dishonest people from cheating? <b><i><P>We don't "choose to ruin" anyone's play experience. However we must have a set of policies to insure everyone receives the same treatment. Now that doesn't mean that by treating everyone the same that the outcome will be "fair", but at least it is uniform. </b></i><P>He returned and *poof* all his equipment from two separate characters were gone <b><i><P>Though I'm not familiar with this particular incident, it sounds like someone else had his username and password. In fact, that's really the only way this particular thing could have happened. We can't take responsibility for the security of the username and password for player&#8217;s accounts, which is why we prohibit giving them to anyone. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

EverQuest has been named CGO's Online Game of the Year in their <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/026/150/intro.html">Computer Games Awards</a>.  Here's a clip:<BLOCKQUOTE>EverQuest remains a game for the dedicated and not the casual player. The game ruthlessly encourages, and almost demands, that you play as part of a group and not go it alone. One result of this is that only those players with a lot of time to invest in the game, and who are lucky enough to be able to coordinate that time with a regular group of friends, are able to advance to their full potential. </BLOCKQUOTE>Spotted on the net's #1 source for CRPG news and views the <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com">RPGVault</a>.

3D-Unlimited published a new <a href="http://www.3d-unlimited.com/games/reviews/everquest/"target="_new">review of EverQuest</a> over the weekend.  As you can see from this conclusion, the author wasextremely impressed:<BLOCKQUOTE>EverQuest, simply put, is the most addictive game this reviewerhas ever played. If you want a _fun, engrossing, addictive_ game, then lookno further. Buy yourself a fortified bunker. Station guards at the entryhatch. Seal yourself in. Bring supplies -- LOTS of supplies. Break up withyour girlfriend. Sell your dog. Mortgage your house. Don't forget theport-a-potty.

The first report of the Gathering II, the real-life event that took place in St. Louis last Saturday, has been posted by MakeItSimple.com.  The most interesting pages cover the <a href="http://www.makeitsimple.com/news/gamenews/everquest_g2/page2.html">Demo of Ruins of Kunark</a> and the <a href="http://www.makeitsimple.com/news/gamenews/everquest_g2/page3.html">Q&A with Verant Interactive</a>.  Here's a few excepts:<UL><b>Graphic Enchancements</b><br>The graphic enhancements were the first thing we noticed, and while not making it a whole new game, they're pretty impressive. Screenshots can reveal the increased poly-counts and texture sizes, but once you actually see the game in real-time, you get a full understanding of the enhanced graphic features. New animation effects are evident in objects such as trees that sway in the wind, or the shuffling of the Forest Giant's vest as he moves about. <P><b>GZ Keeps His Cool</b><br>We also managed to catch Geoff Zatnik (GZ), who designed the EQ spell database among other things, talking in-depth about current issues and upcoming features. He was given a particularly hard time by a certain attendee who felt that the Wizard class was underpowered. Despite this person's repeated complaints and attacks, not once did Geoff lose his cool, tactfully addressing each and every point with a rational explanation. His dialogue was a real testament to the professionalism and expertise of the Verant staff. <P><b>Hell Levels</b><br>Although they wouldn't confirm this, they did say that every level after 50 would be the equivalent of a "hell level". Currently, the "hell levels" are 30, 35, 40, and 45, which take considerably longer to advance through than the other levels. </UL>Be sure to check out the complete report for all the info!

Aenadil sent the following to me:<BLOCKQUOTE>I am writing to inform you about the turnout of the Xegony Bazaar the was yesterday, March 4th, at 9:00 PM EST. There was a very good turnout at the event; at the peak time I counted 140+ players. I was told at the event that other bazaars have been tried, but failed. I am so glad this one worked! All that I could see had fun and sold/bought what they needed.<P>I would like to make this a weekly occurrence on Xegony since we have no weekly bazaars. So I will also say in advance that the next Xegony TradeFair/Bazaar will be held Saturday, March 11th at 9PM EST. This is much better then the one day notice I gave before. Thank you all for a great turnout! I hope to see you all at the next one.<P>Aenadil</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon Wrinn spoke about the new expansion race and PvP Teams' briefly in a recent post on the official Kunark boards.  Here's the thread:<UL>Any word yet regarding which team the Iksar will be on? <P>Please don't put them on the evil race team as they already control all the best hunting grounds.<P><b><i>Well, there won't be enough of them after the "newness" of them wears off, so putting them on their own team really isn't an option.<P> We'll probably put them on the evil team unless someone can come up with a compelling argument for them to be on another.<P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>More discussion on the Iksar can be found on our <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5119">Iksar Message Board</a>.

From Syruss:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hi there!<P>Just wanted to get the word out that me and a team of friends have started a great new site called TheSky.Org (a href="http://www.thesky.org">http://www.thesky.org</a>). Our goal: To provide the EverQuest community with an online 'news ticker', updated daily with general news, server specific news, and forum posts by the EQ team. (Our forum logs section will eventually evolve into a megaplex of every post made by any EQ staff member in the past and present!) All info is collected from the many EQ related sites across the internet and presented in clean, "plain jane" form for easy surf-free reading. <P>Our hope is that TheSky.Org will not be competition for various sites (like EQVault), but a gateway of EQ information to all the great sites that are out there.<P>So please, drop by and enjoy the fruit of our labors thus far!<P>- John "Syruss" Wooldridge (<a href="mailto:syruss@thesky.org">syruss@thesky.org</a>)</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

While making my rounds on the Gameplay board today, I came across this post made by Gordon Wrinn:<UL><i>I have a question for everyone here. Maybe we'll try to come up with a login poll as well. <P>Should the GM/Guide staff even try to get involved in Kill/Camp/Spawn Stealing issues? <P>If so, what would you suggest for a uniform policy that will work in the vast majority of cases? Now before you say something like "he who was there first", please limit your response to the information that a GM will have at the time. They are called after a problem has occurred. When they get there, they have no idea who was there first. All they know is that there are bunches of people here all pointing fingers at each other. <P>I'd just like to hear the player&#8217;s thoughts. GMs and Guides already get a large number of player personality issues that they have to work out. On a player with 1800 people, a full 30% of the petitions is usually due to someone having a problem with another player. On the PvP servers, that's upwards of 80%, despite the fact that you think that players might be more likely to take matters into their own hands. <P>Thoughts?<P> -Gordon</i></UL>That thread can be found by <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/023776.html">clicking here</a>.

Gordon Wrinn, of Verant Interactive,  was busy on the boards today.  Here are quotes and excerpts from his latest posts:<UL><b>Up'ing the group limit to 8</b><br>I think that this would tend to exacerbate the problem more than solve it. My *pet* idea for getting people to spread out would be to make heavily camped zones dynamically turn PvP when too many people are in them. Somehow I don't think the tuning team, not to mention the customers, would go for that one.<P><b>NPC Binding</b><br>Being honest with you Krux, the idea of making NPCs so they can Bind PCs is really a dead horse. I've seen all kinds of reasonable proposals, but the truth remains that limited melee binding is not an oversight, but part of the plan.<P><b>Languages</b><br>I'll forward this to the client programmer. I think it would make a bit more sense for the language to be changed with a "/language" command that takes the language name as a parameter. It might make a nice change if his schedule frees up for a few hours.<P><b>Monk Issues</b><br>Someone sent me an email yesterday outlining some pretty compelling issues with some of the monk stuff. Specifically mentioned was the fact that a lot of the pre-plane stuff has better stats than shiverback. I'm looking this info over now. <P>As for AC in general, Monk pieces will always be pretty low in AC due to the fact that monks get an AC bonus just for being a monk. But I do think that the plane gear should probably be better than the mundane stuff. <P><b>Kunark Pricing</b><br>Discounted compared to the cost of buying a brand new boxed set. <P>But if the complaint in general is that people who have been playing for a year will pay more money for EQ+expansion than new players will pay for EQ+expansion, this is true, and an acceptable standard in business. <P>Analogies work best for this:<P>1. Take for instance if you buy a brand new car as soon as the model-year is available. You'll pay more than someone who buys the same new car prior to the next model-year being released.<P>2. People who bought a DVD player as soon as they went on the market will pay more than people who buy them now.<P>3. HDTV compliant sets are pretty pricey now. I'm waiting a while. Hopefully I'll not only get a better price, but a better set.<P>4. My computer at home is a PII-450. I can still buy a brand new PII-450, and it will cost me much less than my computer did originally. <P>The additional money you pay when something first comes out is a premium for being among the first to own it when its brand new. <br>--<br>Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to dance. We're still waiting on the pricing to be finalized. <P><b>Potion Issues</b><br>There were a couple of things such as this that were suggested back when I was settling into the job here. <P>Having meaningful healing potions out there that can be bought from a vendor would reduce class-interdependence. Yes, as you said, your suggestion is a money sink that would help all classes solo better, but the truth is that that is a money sink that we've specifically decided not to take advantage of. We don't allow people to buy healing, nor do we allow them to buy experience. That's why the healing potion is basically useless, and it's also the reason why we've adjusted the experience given out by some quests.<P><b>Why Servers weren't selected for the Transfer Option</b><br>It depends on the time of day really. There were any number of servers we could have chosen for the other two besides Fennin that we took people from. <P><b>Togor Issues</b><br>I understand where you are coming from, and you make a lot of sense. The issue is that an upgrade to Togor's is planned for the expansion, and it will *probably* be better than the this one was. However the level to which that would have been better would be too small to be worthwhile had Togors not been adjusted. <P>Strength has a similar issue, except its problem was a pure error in the entry of spell data as opposed to an overpowering, as in Togor's case. To illustrate this, a spell can have X effect, plus Y effect per level. When these spells were being entered in batch, the previous spell that was added had a "Y" value, but a much lower value of X. When Strength was put in, the existing Y value wasn't reset to its default value. <P><b>Cleric Armor</b><br>The AC of the cleric class-specific armor is being increased based upon a spreadsheet that was sent to me by one of the players. <P>I think I mentioned last week that we were going to take another look at some of the class-specific armor.<P><b>Spawn Times</b><br>Actually, spawn times across servers are all somewhat independent, based upon the load in the zone (and other zones running on the same piece of hardware). The servers automatically throttle how much they have to keep track of so that they don't peg their processor usage, which would be *really* bad. <P>The problem on Bristlebane a bit back where the spawn times in LowerGuk were 3 times normal had to due with this same issue. Of course in that case it was due to a bad piece of hardware.<P><b>On Alchemy</b><br>The latest changes to alchemy were a complete overhaul. I wouldn't be surprised if it still needs a tweak or two, specifically in the area of prices. However, we'll let people settle in and wait for the initial shock wears off before making any firm plans. <P>I should probably note that I've gotten email both ways. Some people think it's fantastic now and needs no changes. The some think that the potions that can be made are great, but the prices need a tweak, and some people think that it's completely useless.<P><b>Shaman Issues</b><br>These are some compelling arguments about the shaman spells. I'll bring them up at the tuning meeting. What will happen if we decide not to change them is that you might not get as many spells as were planned in the expansion, but it's a thought. <P>Be honest with me for a second, is the shaman class really "destroyed" by a 5% ranged reduction in the attack-speed slowing of Togor&#8217;s and a 20-some point reduction in Strength? <P>As for the clipping plane, I'm still trying to get with the client programmer about it. I'll get back with you.<P><b>Smushu + Torakk = g47</b><br>Of course. This change was made due to a balance iss.....er... wait.. I have *no* idea what this is about... :)<P><b>More Rogue Issues</b><br>This was not an "either/or" situation. Poison is still on the plate. However we were looking for other ways to reduce the perception that rogues "sucked". <P>That's where evade came in. One of the major complaints I saw was that rogues constantly caught the critter's attention because of all the damage they did, and ended up dead faster than the cleric could heal them, thus making the cleric OOM and unable to support the real, thus killing the whole group. <P>Testing showed this to be a valid issue, one that the monks (the other high speed melee damage dealers) didn't have to contend with due to feign death. Just giving rogues Feign Death would have been pretty easy, but we didn't want to just copy the monk. The Evade ability integrated into the Rogues hide fit the bill pretty well, and from what I see on the Safehouse, they are very happy with it. Most of them have even seen their damage potential go up due to the number of additional backstabs they get in, and not nearly as much running around screaming "TAUNT IT!! TAUNT IT!!" like they used to :)<P>The hotkey lock problem is also still on the table. <P><b>GS Interview: "Making items not class-specific will decrease camping"</b><br>Brad's out of the office today, on his way to St. Louis for EQ Gathering II, but I'll put my money on that being a typo. Considering that the changes that have been made to the game to reduce camping has included the introduction of class-specific items, I think that's a fairly safe bet :)<P><b>Rechargable Items</b><br>We're actually going to start experimenting with some recharable items soon. The difficulty is making it sufficiently meaningful that it still counts. For instance, if an item off of a deity gives 5 charges of Clarity, we don't want to make recharging it so easy that it hurts the enchanter. Many of the charged items out of the Plane of Sky will be rechargable. Based on how those go, we might make additional items rechargable.<P><b>On Quests</b><br>Some quests do have level limits necessary to *start* the quest. However once someone knows it they can do it over and over again as long as their faction is good. <P>In hindsite, we would like to have included not only level limits, but a way to keep track of the quests completely to disallow quest farming. We'll certainly keep these issues in mind for future products.<P><b>Roleplaying Servers</b><br>We consider all servers to be RP servers since this is a role-playing game. Role-playing is a personal decision that each player makes for themselves. The joy for role-playing should be role-playing itself, not any tangible benefit handed out by the game. That's why when people say "There's nothing to encourage role-playing", I get very confused, as there is everything to encourage it, except perhaps ones own propensity to become self-conscious. <P>Now, if you are asking about an "Enforced Role-play" server, we'd consider it as soon as someone comes up with a definition for role-play that would allow us to enforce it. We catch a lot of flack for our naming policy, which is much clearer than any enforced role-playing server could be in my humble opinion. <P>Now if we are talking about an un-enforced role-play server, I'd have to say that that would do no better than the servers we have now, which are all basically un-enforced roleplay servers. Perhaps in name alone, it would support further role-playing, but I'm sure that many people of all play-styles would join it, if for no other reason than it had less players for the first few hours. </UL>

Aeko informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings!<P>I am putting together a gathering of as many paladins as possible for this coming Sunday, the 5th of March, to raid Mistmoore Castle for our Soulfire hilts and other pieces needed by paladins for their Ro armor. I have spoken individually with some 20 paladins, most of whom have expressed desire to try and make our gathering, and several more have expressed interest on the various paladin message boards. It shall be something of a "Get to know your Fellow Paladin" day as well; booze will be provided in great quantities, and we shall have as much fun as possible camping every available nook and cranny in MM, not to mention pulling the evil Troll SK with our prized hilt to the zone every time he spans to slap him flat! All paladins of the Tribunal server are invited, although the majority of respondents so far appear to be between the levels of 30 and 45 or so. (I suspect our plane-travelling bretheren are on a raid this weekend, but we shall hold the fort in their absense).<P>We shall begin our gathering about noon on Sunday, and will camp the sk all day. Join us if you can -- it'll be fun!<P>Peace!<P>Aeko<br>32nd season Paladin<br>Leader, Court of the Crosswinds</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

An important new message is now being displayed on the Patch Server:<UL>March 2nd, 6:30pm<br>------------------------<P>***Additional Server Migrations***<P>Tonight, during primetime hours, we will again be opening the registration log on Fennin Ro to allow another batch of people to request an account-move to the new server, Druzzil Ro.  In addition, we will also be opening the logs on Solusek Ro and Xegony, allowing some of the people on those two servers to move to Druzzil Ro as well. <P>All of the information contained in the patch message from February 25th (below) still applies to Fennin Ro and also applies to Solusek Ro and Xegony.  <P>The opening of the registration logs will be announced via an in-game broadcast tonight.<P>Clarification on a few items:<P>1.  If you are selected for the move, all of your characters on your account currently on the affected server will be moved.  You do not need to log in each character and execute the command like many people did for the first character migration.<P>2.  Please keep in mind that there will be no special consideration given in the move process in reference to groups, friends, or guilds.  There is a good change that you will be separated from your friends, and it is recommended that you DO NOT REGISTER for the move unless this is not a problem for you.  This is also true for people who have characters on multiple accounts.3.  Since people are being moved from multiple servers, if you are moved there is a possibility that your character's name may be changed in order to resolve any duplicates.  If a letter "X" is appended to your character's name on Druzzil, you may contact a GM in-game to change your name to one of your preference.<P>4.  REMEMBER! As stated below, CORPSES WILL NOT BE TRANSFERRED. If you are moved and your character leaves a corpse behind, the items on the corpse will be lost and will not be subject to reimbursable.<P>-The EverQuest Team</UL>

Verant's Internet Relations Manger, the one and only Gordon Wrinn, made several posts today on the Gameplay board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><b>Journeyman Boots</b><br>What's happening is that he's getting stuck on a rock, and due to that he's not finishing his script that allows him to depop. So yes, killing him is one way to get him off the rock. A GM or Guide should be able to lure him off the rock as well assuming that he's stuck. Usually, after being stuck there long enough he'll find his way off the rock. <P>Of course the long term plan is for us to make it so that he doesn't get stuck on the rock. I'll see what we can do along these lines.<P>Server Transfers, Server CapsWe are absolutly opposed to capping server population, as we feel that it does more harm than good. New people join the game and want to play with their friends, and they can't do that if we've capped the server. <P>Secondly, as people leave a new server, people have to be allowed to move in and take their place. A healthy server economy needs newbies, mid-levels, and 50s. Yes, I'm basically saying that the economy isn't healthy on a brand new server until we see the proverbial bell curve. Luckily the "Racers" move in and help a new server obtain that balance within a couple of months.<P><b>Age and Maturity (Brought up by someone wanting a server for more "mature" players)</b><br>Age isn't exactly a reliable factor to determine maturity in an environment with a high perception of anonymity. I've met 12 year-olds more mature than some 40 year-olds.<P><b>The "Next" Patch Day</b><br>Probably not next week, but the week after. Don't quote me on that yet.<P><b>Lullaby Bugged?</b><br>[After reviewing some evidence posted on the thread] I spoke to Geoff about the original author's tests. It looks like there might be *something* strange going on, but we'll have to run some more tests in House. Geoff will take another look at it after he gets done with the first draft of the expansion spells in the next few days.<P><b>The Phantom Armor Series</b><br>Poor GZ was unavailable for a good deal of time last week. He was in the Hospital from a spider bite. In fact, if anyone going to the gathering in St. Louis this weekend would be so kind as to tease him with a rubber spider, I'd be eternally grateful :)<P>Anyway, we do have the ability to make the spell make you look like you are wearing plate, but that would just lead to every magician above the required level looking like shadowknights or paladins. <P>GZ did say that he'd be willing to look into applying another effect to the phantom series to make it more worthwhile.<P><b>Kunark Box Issues</b><br>There are actually two versions of the box. The first run had a typo and said "five", the second run is correct, and says "three". The number of zones in the 3 continent world is actually higher than what was planned for the 5 continent world. This was all decided about May or June of '98. <P>So no, the expansion is not "bogus". It contains additional content that wasn't included with the original game.<P><b>Druid Expansion Spells</b><br>I should mention that it's entirely too early to be screaming "rebellion!". Spells for the expansion are a Work-in-Progress and hardly a complete list. <P>I won't be commenting specifically on them any time soon.<br>--<br>Of course you all can expect that the spells will be adjusted prior to the release of the expansion. That's the purpose of the beta. If anyone screams "NERF!" when an unofficial, unreleased, beta spell that no one has and only knows about through the use of one of those parser programs, I'm going to bang my head against my monitor.</UL>

Gordon Wrinn responded to a post on the Gameplay forum regarding the upcoming server transfers.  Here's the thread:<UL>One question that comes to mind about bringing in players from Solusek Ro and Xegony to Druzzil Ro is that of duplicate character names. There will very likely be a few duplicate names found from server to server, and this may create problems when migrating accounts from servers other than Fennin Ro. <P><B><I>Yes, we are aware of the issue of possible duplicates, and that will be addressed in the patch message that will go up soon. Basically, it's announced that people who choose to move might need a name change on their character to resolve a duplicate issue, and if this occurs, an "X" will be appended to their name. In the event they have an "X" appended to their name, they may contact a GM in-game and get the name changed to something they pick. </b></i><P>Also, the original Fennin split was capped at 1200 accounts. Will tonights registration use different, lower caps? (ie, 300 accounts from each?). <P><b><i>The number of people we are moving is much smaller than it was yesterday. Ideally, yesterday 100% of the people we moved would have been represented in peak usage. As a side effect though, people who played off-peak logged on and executed the command. In addition, there are also people with multiple accounts that executed the command for each account. As a result, the amount of "peak usage" that was moved was less than we would have liked. Comparing the number moved to the amount of peak usage moved allowed us to estimate the outcome future moves and help us move the right number. </b></i><P>Keep adding new non-split servers (300 copies of the game sold each day -> new servers every other week just to keep up). <b><i><P>It doesn't quite work like that. First, of the new users we attract, roughly 30% play at peak. There's also the fact that people also leave the game.</b></i><P> FINISH the Fennin split first.<P>Once that split is DONE, then see if there's more room for overflow off other servers. <P><b><i>The problem with this is that each split means that the server must be down for an extended period. This goes for the source as well as the destination server. We want to limit the number of people negatively affected by the split, hence we are doing a few at once. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Thanks Andrew!

The following report was sent in to us by Crier Sharpsong:<BLOCKQUOTE>In an extraordinary display of coordination, effort and dedication, twoof the major guilds that made the transfer from Fennin Ro to the brandnew Druzzil Ro made their presence known to the denizens of the newserver last night by slaying both Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox. The formerFennin Ro guild Seekers of Norrath dispatched Lord Nagafen approximately45 minutes after the guild Mythic Legion took down Lady Vox. This taskwas made more difficult by the lack of /guildsay and the loss of a fewmembers of both guilds due to non-transfer. A GM for the new Druzzil Rowas present as a spectator at both events, and was supportive of ourcollective efforts.<P>With only 600 people on the server at peak time, the new Druzzil Roserver was everything that we had hoped that it would be. Thepopulation of Lower Guk was 25 and Sol B 19. The number of level 1-4players was quite high, which is to be expected when any new server isset up, but unlike any other new server there were many characters withlevels all the way to 50. Although many of our dear friends were leftbehind during the move (and sadly a few guildmates as well), theunanimous results from the informal poll that I took last night was thateveryone was ecstatic with their new playing conditions.<P>Thanks to Verant for setting up a new server and allowing a transfer,and thanks to all of the players that make EverQuest such a great gameto play. We will deeply miss our old friends from Fennin Ro that wehave spent 11 months playing alongside, but the move increase theelbow-room for everyone on both servers.<P>Crier Sharpsong<br>Seekers of Norrath<br>47th Song Bard on Druzzil Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for letting us know!<P>And remember, our new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5181">Druzzil Ro Message Board</a> is a great place to meet, plan and discuss topics and issues of the Druzzil Ro server!

From Arr:<BLOCKQUOTE>From the same loons that brought you "Milo is from Mars, Jewel is from Venus", "What Does God Need With A Starship?", and "What Undies Does He Wear Anyways?" Comes an all new Installment in the <a href="http://eq.notcrazy.com/AskMilo" target="EQNC">Ask Milo</a> Series, EverWars: Milo Writes Back. *Starring* Milo Cooper, with a special *Guest Appearance* by Rick Schmitz, and *Produced* by the EQ-NotCrazy 2 Year Anniversary Staff. <P>This installment Features over thirty responses, dozens of Grammatical corrections, and several sordid questions probably better left undiscussed. And, following in the tradtion of other high-budget trailers, here is a clip that leaves you dying to know what the hell is going on and why it is happening in the first place! <blockquote>Sorry, but the technique is a secret, passed down through many generations of my African ancestors from the great tribal chieftan himself, Momama Mojamba. Were I to reveal the secret, mighty Momama's wrathful spirit would descend upon me like a Japanese elevator on Venus. No, seriously, I just use the standard Max 1.2 UVW map modifier (I have to use 1.2 because our in-house plug-ins were written for that version of the software), the shape of which depends on the shape of the object that I'm mapping.</blockquote> With a special introductory price of only one mouseclick, you too can see what EQ fans sometimes rave about.</BLOCKQUOTE>

We will be playing with the new improvements to throwing, and attempting to raise our skill (which I am sure most of you have neglected). We would love to hear of any new throwing weapons that have been added and look foreward to seeing them in action. Daggers will be provided by the Borrowers and (hopefully) from our friends in Arcanum Magus. We hope to have a good turnout and lots of fun. And as usual, after the dagger toss is complete there will be plenty of booze.<P>The Borrowers will also be taking applications to the guild. Please realize that our ranks are excusive in that you must be a rogue to join. Classes other than rogues are welcome to the event, but we would appriciate it if you would please refrain from using weapons other than the throwing variety. This is not intended to be a mass slaughter, but a good time for all involved.<P>-Cunnen Shadowblade, Officer of the Borrowers of Norrath.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the info!
