<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Sollis Windrider end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->I dissagree in general with PK'ing. I went to play VZ when it open eagerly hoping that there would be somewhat normal gameplay (yes, I'm from a carebear server. The Rathe). I was expecting to at somepoint have planned wars, and raids and such. This sounded exciting to me. I was hoping to be able to take revenge should somebody steal my kill, or to be able to hold a spawn for a nice item by force if needed.<br><br>Instead I log in and begin to play. I started a Wood Elf Druid (as this is what I play on The Rathe and I'm used to it). Several Hours later and a few levels I started seeing what turned me off to PvP servers: Random, mindless PKing. I would be running to get my corpse on Orc Hill in Greater Feydark when out of nowhere (due to invis) gnomes and dwarves appeared and slaughtered me. Root, blind, nuke/hack... before I can see or move I'm dead. Ok, no big deal, I didn't lose anything. I got that corpse and the other. Seconds later they appear again, same thing, and I'm missing my PW Tunic that I made when I get back to my corpse. This time I drug it to the guards before looting so I got to keep my gear for a while. Fine, I can play that game too. I got a couple people, and started out hunting. Near Felwith we found a hord of gnomes and dwarves. Then began the corpse camping, and them killing the newbie High Elves. All of this was done in the name of &quot;Race Wars&quot;. I don't know how many times I heard them say &quot;This is a race wars server, we're supposed to kill you&quot; when all I wanted was the option to use force against other people, not the need to use it.<br><br>Do I still play on a PvP server? Yeah, I do. I've got a shaman on RZ, and still play my Druid on VZ. But that is mainly when the Rathe is down, simply due to my first experience. Those people ruined the game for me, and I guess someday I'll try it again as a primary server, just probably not soon.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I play on Rallos Zek also and Chialde is not as bad as most pkers. But you are a member of Dorkenbane!, Chialde. They are an exploiting,corpse camping group of infantile idiots if I have ever seen them. I've onky been killed by thm once, but I'm a very neutral player so I don't get involved in pk wars. I don't know how many times I've seen a lower lvl and a higher lvl DB pk soemone by using the trade window exploit. My roomate and I network 2 comps on EQ and play seperate accounts. I actually watched 2 DB memeber use this bug on him. He reported to no avail. So in response to your touching editorial.. thats fine if you are a honorable pker but you are aligned with a bunch of kewld00d morons and they speak for you.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

The experience changes considerably as you leave behind the quickly made throwaway PKs. People learn how to avoid it (areas of zones and times) and level up, to leave all that behind.<br><br>&quot;all I wanted was the option to use force against other people, not the need to use it.&quot;<br>Of course it's a two-way street and you are also agreeing to others' using force against you at their whim.<br>You can certainly try and make your mark by handling things in a classy way, like the author of the editorial, but if someone thinks they are supposed to kill you on TZ/VZ because of race, well, they have a point.<br>Corpse camping itself is now (though it sure took some time) specifically referred to by Verant as not being an acceptable tactic.<br><br>PS I agree with Aeowyn, I don't think is a very controversial matter. Unlike UO (for its entire history until the recent shift) in EQ _you_ make the choice.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

PvP is very exciting, and those people who play on the various PvP servers and 1)Don't PvP and 2)Whine when others do, should get the hell off of them and onto a Carebear Server.  PvP is honestlly the only way to really role play in my mind, how can you roleplay the racial enmity between the High Elves and the Dark Elves on a care bear server?  The two races should be at each others throats at least 90% of the time, same with Ogres and Dwarves.  Oh well Im done ranting<!--ktalk end_comment-->

The simple fact that the article used proper grammar and spelling was refreshing, not to mention it's neutral and well-balanced tone of presentation. <br><br>My own feelings on PvP and PK are mixed: while I would prefer to play in a PvP environment, I do not believe anything but raw anarchy and rampant chaos can exist in such an environment without permanent death and a non-traditional advancement model (i.e. no 50/500/5000th level uber-gods vs. 1st level basket-weaving drop-outs that couldn't defend themselves from a stiff breeze) to stifle the worst impulses that such &quot;freedom&quot; brings out in many people.<br> <br>Two questions which came to mind while scanning your statements:<br><br>1) How do you select your targets when choosing to PK?  In short, what criteria do you use to say &quot;this PC will be my next challenge?&quot;<br><br>2) What percentage of the PvP/PK population do you feel meets or exceeds your level of rational thought/play?  My own experience with PvP and the tone of your presentation would lead me to believe you are perhaps in the upper 5%/10% of that particular population, with most of the remainder far below you in terms of restraint and courtesy to their fellow player.  What would your estimate of that percentage in EQ be, based on far more direct observations than my own?<br><br>For my own part, I would love to play in a stable PvP environment, for I believe it would greatly enhance the dramatic tension of the experience: unfortunately I have yet to find one which was not simply inhabited by a totally unrealistic number of Jeffrey Dahmer/Charles Manson virtual clones, and EQ's basic design didn't offer me much reassurance that I would find anything different here.  Your article gives me some small hope that I might have been overly pessimistic: please elaborate on that possibility if you would.  <br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Damiano, EQ Prexus<br>Tourges, EQ Prexus<br>Khristoff, AC Leafcull<br>etc.<br><br><br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

I am simply saying that it is POSSIBLE that some percentage of the Player Killing population does not fit this mold.<br><br>You're right,  I do kill players and take their stuff.  What you're missing is that there are only 3 servers out of more than 20 where this is possible.  If you do not wish to be involved in this sort of activity,  you may play safely on a whole host of other servers.  You obviously think Player Killing is simply wrong.  I however,  do not.  To each their own I say.  You have the choice,  as do I,  to be involved in PVP or not.  Please don't opt to play on the PVP servers,  then complain that you don't like player killing!  It simply doesn't make sense if you think about it.<br><br>Chialde<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Some members of your guild are very honorable,skilled players. Alec Soulstrike comes to mind. The unfortunate problem is that the numerous exploiters,cheaters,jerks,etc.. give your guild a bad name. Not to mention your website. &quot;Bitch of the week&quot;, come on how adult and mature can that be. This is by no means a flame to you,because I have seen you in action and your are indeed a honorable warrior. I chose the PvP server because I enjoy the challenge and if I am defeated in honorable battle then I congratulate the person who defeated me. I just don't like the exploiting and name calling that tends to go on alot with DB. Although your training guild Dark Unity is far worse,due to inexperienced players. Hehe, I'm glad they are too low for me. Bunch of savages. <!--ktalk end_comment-->

However... at no point in time did you explaine why you found PKing to be so enjoyable. By your own admition you dont seem to do it for the items. So why do you do it. It doesent advance your charicter in any way. It doesent aid others in any way. In fact the only thing that comes out of a PK fight is loss. Someone losses time or items and gold. Ive played on Zek and still do. The only times Ive become involved in Pvp is to protect otheres who seem to be harased and to defend my self. I never kill an apponent. (if I can help it) and I never search them. Please explane to me what you find so enthraling about causing another player trouble.<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email guess@i.dare.you end_email start_name Seth end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->I am going to speak here a bit on his article, as it touched on a lot of very very nice points.  He can confirm or deny some of these things, but I would like to know sort of, just to test the waters, about the reasons why he does it.<br><br>Allow me to explain.<br><br>I am an avid roleplayer, and I love to do it.  My real personality is quite jovial, quite social, and sometimes amusing(no, really, I'm funny dammit =P)<br><br>However, I like to roleplay, it's a means of having fun for me, and really, I find absolutely nothing wrong with his point of view.  Some people like to smoke others in a game, they're competitive personalities, and that's great.  I prefer to roleplay.<br><br>My question would be:<br><br>Why did you pick EverQuest to be competitive in?<br><br>Not attempting to bash here, but in reality, the game market is saturated with MANY games that provide head to head competition online.  In fact, I know of very few games, like EverQuest(besides MUD's) which actively discourage competitive behavior in order to survive.  It is my firm(yet overly naive) belief that EverQuest is a roleplaying game and will be for a long time, as long as roleplayers maintain a view that roleplaying is most important, rather then psychotic and vindictive out of character behavior reactionary to powergamer &quot;needs&quot;. (Bit of humorous irony there, told you I was funny, didn't I? =P)<br><br>A poster, Damiano, earlier in this thread, mentioned the Charles Mansons and Dahmers of the PvP servers, and as a person who plays their primary on a Race War server, I must agree, that the mentality is so far away from roleplaying, I find it very unpalatable at times.<br><br>Why? I'm a roleplayer, I don't like seeing people running around like mad, using the word &quot;u&quot; and &quot;dood&quot; frequently, adding NOTHING to the character they may play, let alone not even try.  PvP servers just tend to bring out the truly immature crowd, the ones that give legitimate PK's like yourself a bad rap.  I do have a very significant interest in this, and I will explain why.<br><br>Remember when I said my primary was on a PvP server?  Well, my primary is a Dark Elf Magician female, and quite frankly, I've developed the character to be horribly devoted to her race, her God(Innoruuk), and quite frankly, a religious fanatic with NO hope for persuasion.  The character is so far gone, so deluded(and remember, this isn't me lol), that she views killing as a whim.  Killing has no meaning, to kill a light race is like squashing a bug under her heel.  In fact, she is so psychotic, she enjoys the feeling of power that killing one stronger gives her.  She seeks approval within exceptionally select circles(ones she decides, and changes) and controls with force, rather then discussion.  She is also a firebrand in discussion, and is quite frequently a very vocal insulter(although casually arrogant about it)  Being a Magician, she is book learned, and being a Dark Elf, through countless wars, she is a soldier, devoted to her own insanity driven cause.  (Hehe, I rambled a bit, but you have a character history now lol)<br><br>Being on a PvP server, I get a lot of Lights and Darks alike telling me that I am a PK, and complaining that I am some &quot;psycho bitch in real life&quot; when in reality, I know that's not true.  I can empathize about your position that you are not one of those people.  The selfish part of me says, &quot;Crucify him for making me have to endure all that crap to make himself happy&quot; and the regular, conscious and logical part of me says, &quot;He's having fun, I'd rather not ruin it by posting a long and drawn out rant about the bliss of roleplaying.&quot;  (DOH! Just keep telling yourself that I'm funny)<br><br>The point of this long post was to point out SOME of the reasons why people might treat you the way you get treated.  Certainly, my Dark Elf character would never (ooc) begrudge you the fight of your life.  Certainly, her in character pride would dictate you to get a severe verbal asskicking afterwards, most likely shouting, but it's not personal, it never is, and it never can be. =)  If it is, I suck at roleplaying, and I need a check to make sure it's still a game.<br><br>Now as to standard reasons why I would not stand for a person like you (PKer) on a roleplaying server, should this idea ever be implemented.<br><br>- The idea of killing is generally repugnant to most people, of any race, and that's a fact.  People who are simply PK's tend to justify their behavior with roleplaying pseudonyms, like, &quot;I'm a rollplayer dood, shut up&quot; and this annoys me to no end.  I also don't appreciate /tells complaining to me about me killing them.  I'm a Dark Elf, an insane one, and my response won't dictate my real feelings of annoyance, but rather the impersonal and even taunting voice of my character.  If someone won't even roleplay their race, or even try, I don't really think that a roleplaying server is THEIR server.  (Much like was asserted by the former Darkenbane person regarding people who whine about PvP servers and the PvP environment that therefore results from it, I agree that those people are morons.  I do however disagree that it's conducive to good roleplaying, sorry =P)<br><br>- To be perfectly honest, in any game that is mass marketed, you'll get true morons.  I do believe some have posted to this thread already (Mr. Smartypants), and to be honest, if anything annoys me, it's trying to explain something like roleplaying to them.  They won't get the mentality of it, since they've never done it, and they're NEVER open to listening about it either.  Anyone who takes the time to write an article about something either a) has the time to write an article about something or b) has something to say.  I love hearing about what people have to say, as long as it's legibly written, and contains very few racial epithets, and stupid mindless babbling.  (Refer to most of this post for examples of what NOT TO DO in an editorial)  Since a lot of PK'ers tend to be morons, I'd prefer I don't have to deal with them when I am playing EverQuest(God knows that we all get to deal with them on an everyday basis, why should we when having fun?  Am I alone? Right, right?)<br><br>- Nothing personal, but if you indicated a token attempt to roleplay in your editorial, I'd have more respect for you as a quote-unquote, considerable human being.  Roleplaying is one way of being considerate to those who are trying to roleplay.  And really, if you're creative enough to write an article about it, you're creative enough to come up with a roleplaying excuse for just about any &quot;anti-social&quot; behavior you engage in.  Gordon does it every day! (If Gordon's reading this, I'm just kidding, I'm funny, and don't think Verant stormtroopers at my house are necessary.  ;)<br><br>In closing(damn, I wrote an editorial completely by accident here) I would like to say that PvP servers were a good idea.  I enjoy playing there more then I do playing on a blue server.  I enjoy roleplaying my character in a more dangerous environment that is contributed to by more interactive forces then just computer AI.  I do dislike various facets of it, but I do get over that quickly(someone with such a fantastic sense of humor has to, I think everyone here would agree)  I do hope Verant seriously considers a roleplaying server, I hope that I could leave the PvP world, the idiots, and that I would be on a server that fostered roleplaying, and maintained the character tapestry that is, on so very rare an occasion, shown by a very nice roleplaying event without out of character disruptions.  I sincerely hope that Verant DOES consider a roleplaying server with PvP environment, and perhaps screening, an application process, and the ability to lock people out of the server if they do not pass the screening process, and kick them out if they do not adhere to a set of rules defined by the community.<br><br>But regardless, I wish you luck Chialde, we are both a dying breed.  A roleplayer in EverQuest, and an honorable PK.  Honorable PK's tend to kill idiots faster then a level 18 Magician roleplayer.  Have to respect that! =)<br><br>--<br><br>Seth(who is damn funny, no doubt about that)<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email silverwinds@wolfetales.com end_email start_name Mayera end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->I would have to add my agreement to much of what Seth has said. Though for now I am primarily a denizen of the non-PK server Tunare (and member of a non-pvp guild on that server) I do intend to make an evil character on a pvp server in the near future. My resoning behind this is the fact that to my mind, it is nearly impossible to properly roleplay an evil race on a &quot;carebear&quot; server. Just as my lawful good woodelf is known for her sense of honor, and liked by many people she has interacted with, once I get around to making an evil character, I'm quite sure I will be despised. I fully intend to be absolutely ruthless, without taking advantage of aspects of the game which are introduced by the simple fact that it is a game (ie zone camping, bind rushing, etc). I see no point to being PK simply for the sake of beating other players. Rather I prefer to CK (character kill). If my character has no reason to like your character, odds are I would rather kill you than look at you. As Seth has said, there is nothing personal in this, my grudge is against your character, not you. The land of Norrath is a fantasy medeival setting, and as such should be a dangerous, vicious land. This would be where the PK servers come in, offering a player a realm where true roleplay is possible, where there is more than the limited computer AI to pit yourself against. I heartily agree that the idea of a roleplaying only server is an excellent one, if not very feasible from an operational point of view. <!--ktalk end_comment-->

I have played on Tallon? the coin loot one, and I love it, the dark races are constantlly fighting the light races.  I didnt have to worry if the guy I was fighting was red because, whoop de doo, Id just have to walk from my bind spot, never lost anything more then some easilly replaced coin (i.e. a green or blue victim hehe).  But alas I got tired of being low level so I came back to Rallos Zek to put up with all the childich little a-holes that like to kill you when your fighting and/or at a bar of health.  Or better yet, like the guy I ran into the other night.  A Blue con druid who started attackin me, then when I started whoopin his peck arse (forget about Wrath didnt ye?) his Level 50 Cleric pal shows up to help.  Now that crap is lame with a capital &quot;L&quot;. It was obviouslly just a means to kill people and take their loot, there was absoultely no other reason for it (think I forgot to mention that he attacked me as soon as I zoned and followed me repeatedlly back n forth before I gated away with a bar of health).
