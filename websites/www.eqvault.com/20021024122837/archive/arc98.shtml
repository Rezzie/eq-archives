This just in from EQG3 and the <a href="http://www.everlore.com" target="_new">Everlore</a> site:<blockquote>Brad McQuaid just announced that there will be a new expansion based on the continent of Velious here at the EverQuest Gathering. He said the expansion will be chock full of White dragons Ice giants other cold weather based nasties. This December is the expected release date. He has also stated they will be upgrading the current character graphics for this expansion. Be sure to mark this time down in your calendar because you'll for sure want to burn some vacation and stock up on no-doze. </blockquote>This bit was posted on the <a href="http://www.eqanswers.com" target="_new">EQAnswers</a> site: <blockquote><br>The new expansion will take place on Velious, the Ice Land, and will not only contain new creatures but also an upgrade of the existing graphics engine. Among other things, Velious will also have a new starting city for the Barbarian race, and feature numerous ports that are rumored to come off from the upcoming zone entitled &#8216;The Warrens&#8217;. </blockquote><br>I'm still working on getting my lowly magician to Kunark!

Hey ya'll, as Aurum said in his post a little ways down the page, I'm going to be running EQ Vault while he's on vacation. A little about me... I run <a href="http://horizonsvault.ign.com">Horizons Vault</a> as Aurum mentioned [ok ok, stop booing!]. I also work on <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com">RPG Vault</a> and do a lot of misc. things for the Vault. In my spare time I play EverQuest, so I'm not new to the game by any means.<p>Alright, the whole point of this post is that since I'm here watching over things temporarily, the news email eqnews@vaultnetwork.com won't be reaching me. Until Aurum gets back on Sunday, go ahead and send anything you'd regularly send to the eqnews email address directly to me at <a href="mailto:utildayael@vaultnetwork.com">utildayael@vaultnetwork.com</a>.<p>Thanks and I look forward to holding down the fort while Aurum is gone!

The General was kind enough to inform us of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>The Soldiers of Tunare have recently come in contact with a rogue scout, telling stories and spreading rumors that one of Firiona Vie's servants is being held captive by a vicious clan of Burynai, deep within the caverns below Kurn's Tower. This story has been heard by many among the outpost, but to this day no parties have been dispatched in search of the truth, until now.<br> <br>This Saturday, July 8th, at 3 PM EST, Eldrad the General will be leading an expedition to these caverns. This raid is for anyone levels 10 - 25 who would like the chance to check out Kurn's Tower and see what it has to offer. It's a nice dungeon for the younger levels, with somce decent loot for the levels required, and in addition for the raid many monsters will be given new and better high level items to fight with (which will come out as loot when they die). Kurn's Tower is located in the Field of Bone. It's a far hike for the Firiona Vie outpost, so if you can't bind yourself it could be a problem, unless you're welcome enough in Cabilis to bind there (killing a lot of sarnaks and kunark goblins will help factions with most of the guards)<br> <br>If you'd like to come, or donate items for quest rewards/monster loot, send email to <a href="mailto:eldrad@tarewmarr.net">eldrad@tarewmarr.net</a> and/or check out the Tarew Marr Community Center at <a href="http://www.tarewmarr.net">http://www.tarewmarr.net</a><br> <br>Once again the time is 3 PM EST this saturday. The raid will begin at that time with or without you. If you need time to travel there, I'd suggest doing it the night before and camping there, or leaving extra early. The raid forces will be gathering at the bottom of the ramp the leads up, around and into the castle, around 2 PM and going in at 3 PM. Also there should be a few high level players in the zone hosting the event, to help keep some of the "kids" alive, and to hopefully provide revives or resurections to those who die but are bound far away and can't get back themselves.<br> <br>Hope to see ya there :)<br> <br>--Eldrad the General<br>  Tarew Marr</BLOCKQUOTE>

The most recent Patch Message was the center of attention for some of Gordon's most <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059507-2.html">recent posts</a> to the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop:<UL>Umm, abashi.... What if you have more than 8 keys on you and they're nodrop... And they respawn, but you have 8 slots... Eh?<br><br><b><i>Hmmm, good question. My money is on them disappearing. Since there are only 3 keys, and since they spawn with you when you die, there'd really be no reason for someone to have 8 on them IMHO. <br><br>I would however recommend that if you have 8 keys that you do not have them all on you upon death after the next patch.</b></i><br><br>Gordon, are you saying that Verant this is the full notice Verant is giving to the players on those servers? Three hours? What about people that are on vacation because of the U.S. holiday? Or those that just don't happen to play on Wednesdays? Or those that don't read Forums? Do you consider this sufficient time for guilds to learn about this and to try to contact members? even if they discussed it in advance, without knowing the date and time of the move, they won't be able to coordinate their transfers.<br><br><b><i>We'll have registration open all night, giving most that are willing the chance to register. As for the idea of possibly splitting up guilds, that is a danger with all moves. There's no guarantee that if everyone in the guild runs the command that they'll all get moved.<br><br>Finally, I did announce last week that we'd be doing the split this week, so I think that more are prepared than you might think. All of that said, we'll certainly do everything in our power to help those that are split up in the process.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's post #2 in this thread:<UL>In the next patch, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Howling Stones will all be made NODROP if not currently set with that flag." *ahem* Howling Stones IS Charasis..(it has two names for some reason)<br><br><b><i>Ack! Well I meant Veeshan's Peak. Of course, keys for Sebilis and VP are already NODROP, so the main concern was Charasis (Howling Stones). So I guess I got it covered. :)<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's post #3:<UL>ack! Abashi - wait! How come the new server doesn't have a name beginning with an "A" !! Bertoxx is going to be right back in the same boat in a month! Or are you going to "cap" us? (that's what I hope) <br><br><b><i>New users get the old sort order (ascending order by population) until they choose something different. The server selection UI keeps track of the last sort-order selected. <br><br>Only people that came on new between Kunark launching and us fixing the sort order got the alpha order by default. I'm hoping that existing people starting new characters understand the inverse correlation between server population and gameplay, to a certain threshold.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Here's the complete message:<UL>July 5th, 4:00pm<br>-----------------<br><br>*Karana, Bertox, and Test Server Split*<br><br>Hello all,<br><br>At some time between 6pm and 8pm PDT (GMT-8), we will open /movelog registration on Karana, Bertox, and Test, to allow players on those servers to request that their account be moved to the new split-server, Terris-Thule. Players on the affected servers will be informed via server broadcast when registration is open. Players wishing to have their characters moved to the new split server will need to run the command "/movelog yes" after registration is opened.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>- /movelog only needs to be run from ONE character, and will count for all characters on that server on that account. <br>- Players who have requested a move should make sure all of their corpses are looted by the time the server is brought down tomorrow morning (9am PDT). Corpses will not be duplicated in the new world, and anything left on a corpse left behind by anyone who moves will be lost.<br>- We may or may not be able to move everyone who requests this action, based upon the number of total requests that we receive. <br>- The GM/Guide staff will not be able to tell you whether or not you have been selected until after the move is actually completed.<br>- Test Server Players with artificially buffed characters on their account *MUST* delete those characters prior to registering for move. Having artificially buffed characters moved to the live servers will result in action against the player's account.<br><br><br>*Item Changes Pending in Next Patch*<br><br>In the next patch, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Howling Stones will all be made NODROP if not currently set with that flag. This means that people holding more than one key will not be able to hand out their extras after the patch.<br><br>At the same time that this change is made, we are also implementing a new change that "binds" these items to your character. Should you die with one of these keys in your possession, it will not be left on your corpse, but will stay with you when you return to your bindpoint.<br><br>This change was made in light of the difficulty of the key-quests, in order to eliminate the need to do the quest multiple times prior to entering the dungeon. <br><br>-The EverQuest Team</UL>

Gordon spoke about the "finite" life of EverQuest and a little about the history and future of the genre in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059489.html">following thread</a> found on the Gameplay Board:<UL>i know you can cite the number of accounts verant currently has. but what are you going to do when EQ finally has competition? you do realize how many customers you are going to lose dont you? is the company policy "rake it in while we can"? <br><br><b><i>How many are we going to lose? That's hard to say. We all know that EQ has a finite life. Newer games will come along that will grab peoples attention, just like we've grabbed the attention of the current players. This is how the gaming industry works. You grab their attention and keep it as long as you can.<br><br>I don't think that this qualifies as a "rake it in while we can" policy, at least not in a negative sense. We provide a service offering and people decide whether or not they want to be our subscribers. This service offering is flexible, but only to the point that it remains the same offering. Given infinite resources, sure, we have tons of things that we could do for EQ, but will only do those things that make the game "EQ". We won't risk completely changing gameplay to the point that we'd lose the magic that is responsible for EQ's success.<br><br>But as for us not having "competition", we currently enjoy about half of the marketshare among those playing the 3 MMORPGs out there. That's fairly indicative of some current competition. If you recall, EQ was supposed to "Kill" the top MMORPG of the time (UO), and was supposed to be "Killed" by the next (AC). Niether of those things happened, as we all continue to co-exist peacefully. We each provide a niche that a varying and increasing number of subscribers enjoy.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn, back from holiday (though you wouldn't know it with the ammount of posts he made yesterday. :)), resumed business as normal on the Gameplay Board.  Here are the latest quotes and excerpts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059048.html"><b>Celestrial Elixir Broken?</b></a><br>Hmmm, interesting observations. Thank you for sharing them. I'll make sure the test team takes a look at this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059403.html"><b>Server Splits</b></a><br>Karana hasn't been split before. Bertox has, however since the default sort order was changed to sort by Alpha soon after Kunark opened, they've gotten quite a large influx of new players. We've since changed the sort-order back to sort by population for new users. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059390.html"><b>Banning Policies</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So what's next? We gonna ban people for using foul language or expressing their opinions?]</i></font> <br><br>Foul language? Very soon, yes. <br><br>Expressing your opinion? No. Expressing your opinion in the form of spamming personal attacks all over the board, sure. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it is my impression that the terms of service, specifically the conditions under which an account may be terminated, refer to in game behavior, and say nothing about the content or style of messages posted on this board.]</i></font> <br><br>Access to the game (EQ) is subject to having a valid Station account. If your station account is terminated, so is your access to the game. A Station account is subject to the Station terms of service on the Station website. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When there was initial discussion of taking the Sony EQ boards down to PLAYER of EQ ONLY there was a LOT of concern by many players that this would lead to GAME bannings and not BOARD bannings.]</i></font> <br><br>Board bannings and game bannings are one in the same. But you will not be banned from either for merely expressing an opinion that we do not agree with. We've taken action against at least half a dozen accounts over the past 7 months based on what's said on this board. Most often it's been in response to real-life threats of life or limb.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059441.html"><b>Hell Levels</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: VERANT: Very informed opinion on how to fix hell levels Assuming you're still willing to admit hell levels are an unintentional error, here's a dead-simple way to fix them:]</i></font> <br><br>I know you've been following this issue for some time, so I'll keep it short. They aren't broken. Increasing the level-ranged experience requirement causes a need to make up experinece in the first level of the new range. Perhaps we should have spread out that additional XP requirement over the 5 levels of the range, but the same amount of experience would be required regardless. <br><br>Merely doubling the xpgain or halving the xploss in the hell level, or the level after respectively doesn't "fix" the issue, it just makes it faster to get through those levels. <br><br>Though I appreciate everyone's opinion on the matter, the experience system is *absolutely not* subject to post-production changes. Leveling works as it has always worked, and will continue to work in the same fashion. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059443.html"><b>The Vague "Hole" Patch Warning</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why be vague about it unless the goal was to cause at least some people to die for no good reason?]</i></font> <br><br>Must we really spell everything out so that there's nothing left for the players to figure out on their own? The warning given when the Hole went live was as specific as it could have been without just spelling it out. <br><br>Again, like many other things in the game, being the first to explore a new area is dangerous. If that risk (high probability of death) is too severe for the reward (being first), then wait until others have explored an area before moving in.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059456.html"><b>FAQ Update</b></a><br>I did some work on the FAQ, but it's certainly not complete. I'm still putting together the questions for it. Most of the questions posted in response are not really suitable for a FAQ (e.g. "What is the vision for the X class?"). It will probably be around the end of next week before I have anything to post.</UL>

If that penalty is too severe, and people don't want to have to rely on clerics or high-level paladins for resurrections, they have the option to not adventure in places where the risk of death is that high. <br><br>Lastly, if it is too severe, and they don't want to rely on cleris or high-level paladins to reduce the penalty, and they still want to adventure in areas where the risk of dying is high, I'm sorry, but the penalty is something that people will have to deal with. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

The idea of making running the default movement was tackled recently in a recent post that Sony/Verant's Gordon Wrinn made.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058870.html">the thread</a>:<UL>Why do we even have the option to walk? Everyone agrees that the toggle should be set to RUN as a default, but why do we even have the option to move at a slower speed?<br>Ok, some diehard RPers out there switch to walk and put their weapons away when they enter a town, but 99% or more of us don't care whether our weapons are out when we are in town.<br><br>It makes autofollow easier if the leader is walking, especially in strange, tree filled terrain.<br><br>but these, in my opinion, do not even justify the ability to walk, let alone have it as the default. However I do concede that my first reason why people would use walk fits with the vision so I dont see Verant removing the ability to walk anytime soon. But it is time to finally implement the change that sets the default to RUN, quick, before they have a final version of the new client.<br><br><b><i>We're still clinging to the idea that people might decide to walk from time to time as a matter of roleplay, hence, your character walks until it *decides* to run. Is it really that difficult to hit a few buttons when logging on?<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn responded to a post centered on accusations that Verant has has made a change to Pumice.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059335.html">original post followed by the response</a>:<UL>I realize that the "pumice" change may have been a "vision" move, however, where's the official statement about it?<br><br>This is a HUUUUGE change. Every caster class gets "Cancel Magic" which they can cast on themselves even when blinded, rooted, snared, etc. Plus they have the ability, ALL the casting classes, to slow us melee only down in some way.<br><br>Why is this fair to nerf the pumice stone? Maybe a 1 second casting time, but 4.5? They can stack new dots on me faster than I could pumice them off! They can resnare before I even get thru taking the 2nd dot off me!<br><br>Come on now!<br><br><b><i>There wasn't supposed to be an official announcement before-hand. The existing item wasn't changed, but rather, the vendors just sell a different item now. The original pumice stone is still in game, and in fact, drops someplace as loot now.<br><br>That said, I'm assuming you want to know why it was done. Frankly, purchased items should generally not be more efficient than casting the spell yourself or getting someone else to cast it upon you. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Cyane informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>The Sabbat of Rallos Zek conquered the plane of sky in the most sucessful sky<br>raid of the server to date.  We spent a total of three days in Sky going from<br>the Fairy island to the Bzzazzt island.  We tackled the Noble Dojorn, Keeper<br>of Souls, Overseer of Air, and Spirioc Lord.  Players recieved many quest<br>components, and loot was amazing in total: 3 ranger, 2 paladin, 1 warrior, 1<br>bard, and 1 rogue haste belts, one weight of the gods and a treant tear.  <br>Four quests were completed, Kaukaz Killjoy and myself finished the quest for<br>the Runed wind amulet. Luta Livre and Reefman ShadowWalker completed the quest<br>for the Griffon wing spauldors. We had plans to continue up on the path to the<br>top but unfortunately the Bzazzt leader stopped us. We vowed to return to sky<br>and slay it someday.  All in all the raid was a complete success!

I spotted a new reply Gordon posted on a thread titled <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059032.html">The Source of Verant's Problems</a> on the Gameplay Board.  Here are excerpts from the original post along with Gordon's response:<UL>Now Abashi has stated that rogues are "the necromancers of melee" and later clarified that he means that they are on the upper end of the balance scale, which would seem to indicate that he considers necromancers to be nearly perfectly balanced<br><br><b><i>Actually, no. I would consider necromancers to be "on the virge of being overpowered". By "overpowered" I do not speak of pure offensive power, but everything that makes up a class that figures into the balance equation. "Perfectly balanced" lies somewhere between "overpowered" and "underpowered" in this sense. <br><br>By saying that rogues are the "necros of melee", I was not speaking of versitility nor solo capability, but rather that rogues are on the virge of being overpowered every bit as much as necros are. The original vision for rogues was more of a "thief" than they are now. However inability to fully implement some of the skills we had planned (sense/disarm traps), we decided to fit them more into an "assassin" role. </b></i><br><br>Now since they could not fit Verant's niche monks invented a new, valuable and effective niche for themselves and became EQ's master pullers, bringing themselves back into balance with the EQ's environment<br><br><b><i>I've taken quite a bit of heat from some players about some comments that I made about not liking feign-pulling. Quite simply, when feign-pulling, a monk uses a skill that we created for something other than its purpose. Feign Death was supposed to be an escape skill, not a skill that allowed easier breaking of camps. Also consider that feign-pulling doesn't make sense from a roleplay perspective (we like it when things make sense in this fashion). Can you see a creature saying, "I'M MAD AT HIM, I'M GOING TO KI...wait... he's dead now.. I guess I'll go ba...AH HA! HE'S NOT DEAD, I'M GOING TO KI...wait...no... dead again....(ad nauseam)" </b></i><br><br>Verant needs to realize that they have not created the perfect gaming environment, and therefore need to alter their perception of some of the classes and bring them in line with the world they have created, not the world they had envisioned. <br><br><b><i>We're well aware that the game isn't perfect. Afterall, what game can be? That said, what good would we do as game designers if we did not have some idea for the way we wanted the game. People will continue to make the decision as to whether the game we offer is one that they are willing to play. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>
