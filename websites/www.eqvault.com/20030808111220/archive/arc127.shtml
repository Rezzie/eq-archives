Suineko sent me the following report of a GM event:<BLOCKQUOTE>Long ago, while working my rounds purging the temple in the Feerott of<br>Thules scaled worshippers I heard news of another scaled beast via<br>the bards of Norrath... A singer had been seen in steamfont, accompanied<br>by a dragon, and she told of Veeshans coming return. <br><br>Again, word flew the taverns and bars of the world, and it was told that<br>she and her dragon had been slain at the hands of Mayongs man, who<br>then sent a pawn to the hell hole known as Dagnors Cauldron to employ<br>a dwarf of almost godlike skills to retrieve an... item... from the<br>ice Wyrms lair, Lady voxs own private treasures.<br><br>When for a third time rumblings of the scales awakening reached by ears<br>I abandoned by Crusade against the heretic lizards, and joined my<br>companions in a rush to Permafrost. We arrived to find a young, frail<br>rogue leading a High elven Lady of beautiful elegance and her company<br>of guards, trolls and the like, deep within permafrost to Vox's<br>nest... where we found the Dwarven rogue making his way out, carrying<br>a shard whos loss had raised the Dragons ire such that her screams<br>and roars shook the walls and caused the ice of the caverns itself<br>to fall.<br><br>The rogue, skilled as he was, was flushed with his success and<br>fearful of Mayongs temper, and wished to leave quickly. That fear, perhaps,<br>his downfall, as the Lady we were with began to seduce him, flattering<br>his skills, speaking of his feat, until at last she held the Shard<br>in her hands for "just a moment". She did not lie, for that moment ws<br>all it took to seal the dwarfs doom as her guards moved with inhuman<br>speed and slew him.<br><br>Vox roared again. Her goblins cowered. The intruders in her realm had<br>her treasure and vanished before she could rally her still considerable<br>might. One of the less... bright of the races in the Ladys guard let<br>slip a few words, enough to lead us to the Rathe mountains.<br><br>We arrived to see a Dragon, blue as the sky, its wings stretched<br>in triumph over the mysterious company. As we hurried to its place<br>we caught the Lady thanking her guide, the rogue, as two more of her<br>company shed their forms and took on wings... 2, then 3 dragons<br>soared above us, exultant in their triumph, the shard itself a shard<br>of Veeshans own claws, a relic of great power.<br><br>As she thanked the rogue, shadows gathered. Mayong, his prize torn<br>from his grasp had not been idle as the dragons wheeled in the sky.<br><br>Suddenly one fell, followed swiftly by its comrades, as the Undead<br>lord who aspires to godhood slew all those he could see in the air.<br>The lady, still concealed from him in elven form although doubtless<br>a Child of Veeshan herself, spoke swiftly to the rogue.<br><br>A sacrifice was required. Blood of one of the lesser children to open<br>the plane of sky and allow Veeshans kin ingress to slay those who would<br>usurp her and their rightful place on the world. He would die, of his<br>own choice, by the shard, and rise again as their champion, soul claimed<br>by the Wyrm Queen.<br><br>Despite my fears, and warnings, the rogue took this path, perhaps<br>flattered by the celestial attentions, perhaps hungry for reward and<br>power, maybe even merely fearful of the consequence should he refuse.<br><br>But he accepted, and the shard turned in his hands and slew him. When<br>he rose he was known as the Claw of the Scale. The remaining children<br>of Veeshan fled then before mayong could penetrate their cloak, and<br>left their new catspaw on Norrath, the shard still in his possession.<br><br>War is brewing, and this time I need no bards to tell me of its<br>consequence. Two sides, neither with the interests of the free peoples<br>at heart, struggle now for dominance, Mayong who pledged the death of<br>dragons and mortals all alike, and Veeshans children, returning to claim<br>the surface of Norrath from the usurpers who walk on two legs.<br><br>Be careful who you aid friends. Our fates are in the balance, and before<br>long we may find our only defence against these powers is in unity<br>ourselves. There may not be reward in refusing to serve these powers<br>beyond freedom for ourselves, but that is a powerful thing itself.<br><br>The gateway to Veeshans domain, the plane of sky, is crumbling and<br>this blood sacrifice may have torn it entirely asunder.<br><br>Mayongs power now extends far beyond the boundarys of his citadel, a<br>location perhaps more feared even than the lairs of the Ring of Scales<br>outcasts.<br><br>Do not mistake beauty for goodness friends. Be wary, and fearful.<br><br>OOC: <br>A GM event on Bertoxxulous. It was good, and nicely played, but packed.<br>As usual there were crowd control problems - I think maybe GM's should<br>be given an AE sit down and shut up audience spell or something ;) - but<br>it went off pretty well. I missed the beginning and a bit in the<br>middle as I travelled the long way from permafrost to Rathe, but its<br>mostly in there I think.<br><br>We also possibly missed the end on Bertie - finally too many people had<br>gathered, some intent on disrupting the play, and the GM characters left<br>some threads hanging that they obviously intended to finish. I think<br>we pretty much got it all though.<br><br>I'd post the logs but I kept getting disconnected so they're kind of<br>scrapp; overall a few ice giants were killed but this was mostly a<br>non-participation event, like a play staged for us.<br><br>And the three dragons were awesome ;)<br><br>Love,<br><br>Suineko<br>Suiddaru Fallenstar, 36th ranger and wannabe cyclops, Bertoxxulous</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

In regards to a new real-money auction a popular EQ site recently launched, Gordon Wrinn had the following to say about EverQuest.com's support of the feature: <UL><i>In short, one of the people who post news items figured that this one was OK since the auction specified that it was for exchange in Platinum, without knowing that the site in question also hosts auctions for real cash. We've since removed the news item and apologize to anyone offended.<br><br>Our position is that we do not support or condone the exchange of items, platinum, or accounts, for cash. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

A <a href="http://www.intelligamer.com/admin/editor11.asp">unique editorial</a> was published recently by Intelligamer.  This focuses on the "Vocal Minority" of EverQuest.  It explores several apsect of this crowd, including that of the board scene.  Here's a quote from this article:<UL>If this is all you ever read about the game, you'd get the impression that the game was incredibly bad and that you should have nothing whatsoever to do with it. But that's not the case at all. The real situation is that a very vocal, very passionate, and really very small group of players has taken it upon themselves to tell Verant how to design, upgrade, and fix the game. They do this at high volume as often as they can in as many ways, shapes and sizes as they can. And the truly amazing thing about all this is that the very same people who hate the game, hate the developer and will go out of their way to tell everyone in the world their opinion also continue to play the game day in and day out.<br><br>At last count Everquest has more than 200,000 active subscribers, most of whom play daily. That's 200,000 people paying $10 a month. You'd figure that if the game really sucked that that number would be falling. But it isn't. It keeps rising, even in the face of new competition from Asheron's Call.<br><br>A lot of people have said that because you invest so much time in a game like Everquest you tend to get passionate about what you like and dislike. And you tend not to want to take the drastic step of canceling your account after the, literally, weeks or months of your life you invested in improving your character. All true enough.</UL>To read the rest of the editorial use the link provided above.

Brad McQuaid, Vice President of Verant Interactive, tried a daring experiment last weekend.  Here's his announcement straight from the Gameplay board courtesy of Anders:<ul><i>I want to try something. I don't know if it will work well, but what the heck. <p>I want to spend some time today answering questions. Let me lay down some guidelines on the questions though: <p>1. Keep them short -- one or two sentences max. Short, succinct, to the point, etc. <p>2. No nasty flames, loaded questions, veiled insults, etc. <p>3. Nothing situationally or contextually too specific. Keep questions to a more general level. No 'why does item (or quest or spell) a with stats b & c vary from item d'. To be honest, I don't know a lot of the game at that level of detail (no one person can, and my job is to understand the game as a whole more than to have memorized every quest, spell, and item), and that's not what I want to focus on here anyway. <p>Keep the questions at more of a global level. Ask me about the Vision(TM), or the philosophies behind game mechanics, etc. Maybe we can put together a FAQ IF this works out (I know stephenmcleod tried to do something like this recently). I think the key here is to keep the questions short and the answers fairly short as well. My answers will be pretty blunt and matter-of-factly as opposed to responding with a detailed essay. <p>I will try to answer as many questions as I can. This is really an experiment to see if I can be of some assistance in explaining issues, positions, viewpoints, etc. I can't guarantee I will get to every question, nor will I be able to focus on this thread after tonight. <p>Also, in addition to being unable to answer the really specific item/quest/spell questions, I may also be unable to answer some questions about the future (for example, what all will the EQ team work on post-expansion, or will there be an EQ 2, etc.) or about areas that we've chosen to keep private (for example, what is the exact topology of an EQ server). <p>Anyway, enough disclaimers and explanations. Let's give this a shot :)<p>-Brad</i></ul>Brad must have used up a couple of keyboards during this experiement.  I can't post the complete Q&A sessions just because of how large each of them is.

Our friends at Verant Interactive were kind enough to supply us with four all new screenshots of the Ruins of Kunark expansion!  Each shot was taken in 1024x768 resolution mode and are incredibly <i>fantastic</i>.

Korpios will have this fixed today.<br>2.) Event Headlines.  Our fearless Technical Directory Korpios will also get this feature reinstalled by day's end. :)<br>3.)

Over three years ago a little known gaming network launched it's second site devoted to what was then Sony Interactive's recently announced MMORPG EverQuest.  Three years and several million hits later we&#8217;re proud to unveil EQVault's fourth redesign.<br><br>It's been a long time coming.  For the past two months our staff has been working to improve the site in many ways.  Aside from the obvious design and graphical changes, we've remodeled the subpages, news system and editorial system!  Here's a quick run down of some of the additions and changes:<br><br>-News Search Engine!  (One of the most asked for features in EQV history)<br>-News Comments<br>-Print News Feature<br>-Email News Feature<br>-Email Page Feature<br>-New Strategy Content<br>-New Editorials<br>-And more!<br><br>Thanks is due to another group of great contributors to the Vault, namely you!  We wouldn't be here today if it weren't for the thousands of loyal viewers who have stuck with the site over it's lifetime.  We greatly appreciate not only visiting the site, but continuing to contribute to the site as well.<br><br>I can say without a doubt the best is yet to come. :)  Stay tuned throughout today for some exciting new additions and surprises!<br><br>Cheers!<br>

John Smedley also talked about the downtime suffered by the Nameless this weekend on the Gameplay board.  Here's his post:<UL><i>Brad's correct in that we've lost a server exactly 3 times in EverQuest's lifetime. This one particularly bothered me, because it's the 2nd time it happened to The Nameless. This time around I had them completely switch in entirely new hardware for the server because we began to suspect another piece of hardware in the configuration. <P>We do apologize for any downtime Nameless players have experienced. We understand completely that you pay us for a service that is expected to run 7/24 and we do our best to live up to that. In certain circumstances like this we need to tread extremely carefully to make sure we don't lose a whole bunch of data. That's why we backup everything (It's actually backed up in multiple ways). <P>Again, please accept our apologies and know that we are doing our best to make sure this kind of thing is inredibly rare. <P>Regards, <P>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</I></UL>

The folks at 3DGN have published a brand new <a href="http://www.3dgaming.net/stuff/quickie/4100.shtml">preview of Ruins of Kunark</a>, the upcoming EQ expansion.  No new information was revealed but for those who can't get enough Kunark it's a good read.  Here's a clip:<UL>The cost isn't all that bad, for an upgrade that you can play endlessly, that is. EBX says the price is right at $37.99, and since they have a return policy that makes those unfortunate souls who bought Quake 3 very happy, they must be right. But if you already own EverQuest, just wait for Verant to announce their upgrade plans shortly. <P> The box art is once again done by fantasy artist god Keith Parkinson, who I worship every day from 9-5 here on the discovery channel. If you're a real dork, I'd suggest picking up the expansion pack, which will ship with the original EverQuest and an updated map, simply to give yourself something to do in the bathroom, since you have so much spare time on your hands. </UL>

EQ Producer Brad McQuaid talked about the downtime the Nameless server experienced this weekend.  Here's the first post:<UL><i>Actually, I think this has happened 3 times in the history of EQ... maybe 4. <P>It does suck. Thank God it happens very rarely thanks to the RAID setup on our machines. Basically, 2 drives have to go bad around the same time for this to happen.<P> The chances of that happening, of course, is very small, which is why it's only happened 3-4 times in a year. <P>Typically a single drive goes bad, we bring down the server, put a new drive in, and rebuild it. <P>But if the RAID controller and/or 2 drives go bad, it's restore from backup time. <P>I assume this is what happened on the Nameless recently, though I've not talked to anyone one at EQ Operations. <P>In any case, what's with the 'it's happened twice on the Nameless!!' stuff? Do you guys think we're picking on servers now? Nerfing hardware instead of classes? <P>Yeah, we're putting substandard hardware in the Nameless because, well, um, we hate the Nameless! Er, no, um, we're stealing Nameless CPU cycles to reverse to reverse engineer a UFO found in Verant's basement! <P>The truth is out there! <P>-Brad</i></UL>Here's Brad's second post on this:<UL><i>tpowell2: rebuilding while keeping the server up creates an unaccpetable performance hit. <P>Senlaan: Yeah, I'm at home, it's the weekend. I'm spending my free time posting here. I'm not at work talking to the EQ Operations team.<P> In any case, my post responded to two things: <P>Contrary to what csorrows posted, people wanted more info, and I gave it to them. I explained what can cause, albeit very rarely, data loss.<P> I addressed, using comedy to put things in perspective, some people's assertions that we are targetting, or neglecting, or maliciously messing with the Nameless server. <P>-Brad</i></UL>

The following Patch Message has been added to the Patch Server:<UL>Emergency Patch April 1, 2000<br>-------------------------------------<P>The EQ servers were quickly brought down this morningfor an emergency patch update.  We'd apologize once againfor taking the servers down, but what would be the point?<P>The following changes were made:<P>1.) Wizards - We've finally given Wizards a few quick"Insta-Death" spells.  Our hope is that this will makeall the wizards shut up for a little while, until theystart to complain about lack of plate armor for their class.<P>2.) Druids - Because of the over-abundance of Druids in Norrath, the next timeyou login one out of every three Druids will be randomly reassigned a newclass.<P>3.) Warriors and Monks - These melee classes have been given magical abilities at last.They now can bind, gate, heal and summon food.  <P>4.) Magicians and Enchanters - New pet spell added: Nagafen.  We've given these two classes a fine new pet to helpthem in their everyday struggles in Norrath.    <P>5.) Rogues - We feel this class is our crowning achievement.  We believe it has been perfectly balanced, and as suchwill not receive any modifications for the rest of EverQuest's life.<P>6.) Hybrids (Rangers, Paladins, Shadow Knights) - After careful data analysis we've come to the conclusion that simply giving these classes a few of their spellcaster counterparts spells is not enough.  So thus we've given them all the spells they would normally receive had they been a Druid, Cleric or Necromancer.<P>In addition to these changes, the Necromancer and Cleric classes will be overhauled in the near future!  Unfortunately if you already have a character that is one of these two classes you will loose all your items and be randomly renamed.<P>Thanks for your patience!<P>-The EverQuest Team</UL><b>Update:</b> For those who haven't figured it out yet, April Fools! :)

Verant Interactive's John Ratcliff talked about Verant Interactive in St. Louis, Mo recently on the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5158">Hero's Journey Dev Board</a>.  Here's what he said:<UL><i>John Ratcliff, that's me, has an office in St. Louis because this is where my home and my family is and has been for over twenty years. <P>I enjoyed working at Simutronics and loved working on 'Cyberstrike 2' and 'Hero's Journey.' Now I'm working on a project for Verant. Before that I worked for Electronic Arts for almost 12 years doing a number of games. <P>No, I did not play paintball, airsoft, or any of that stuff at Simutronics. When I was there I *worked*, and worked hard. <P>Now I work hard for Verant. Not that complicated really when you think about it. <P>Regarding the cost of living being 'incredible' I probably should have worded that better. Where our offices are you can own a beautiful 4 bedroom home in a resort community for as little as $120k. For West Coasters such a thing is mind boggling. <P>John W. Ratcliff <br>Senior Technology Architect <br>Verant Interactive </i></UL>Sounds like a nice place to me.  St. Louis, and the area around, is simply wonderful.  Anyway, he later added another post to the thread:<UL><i>Thanks. Sorry to sound so defensive, but getting the story clear about my departure and relationship with Simu is somewhat important to me. <P>I will say this much, the new game I'm working on is not of a genre that has anything to do with any Simu product and probably would not be of direct interest to members of this forum. <P>Thanks for the kind words, best of luck. <P>John W. Ratcliff </I></UL>

The following message was added to the EQ Patch Server:<UL>***EMERGENCY PATCH***<P>Today it was necessary to bring the servers down in order to patch some files designed to correct some stability issues that were introduced in the last patch.  As part of this patch, some minor changes to game-play have been implemented:<P>- Corrected a bug that would sometimes cause an NPC to "warp" out-of-sight when fleeing.  The NPC in question would then heal to nearly full health before coming back to re-engage.  <P>- Corrected a bug introduced two patches ago that stopped NPCs (including pets) from using their "bash" skill unless they had a shield equipped.<P>- Casters of DOT spells will now be notified when their spell wears-off of the target.  In addition, pets will also tell their owner when any spell wears-off of them.<P>-The EverQuest Team</UL>

Gordon Wrinn made his comments about some suggestions posted on the Gameplay board.  Here's the thread:<UL>How about a mystical portal in the game that you can walk through after you pay the NPC who stands next to it 20,000pp a trip to whatever server you want to be transferred to. <P><b><I>We considered doing that at one time, but seriously, would someone who knows how to make 20Kpp *really* want to be on a server with 1000+ other people who know how to make 20Kpp?</b></i><P> Not to mention it's a good money sink, and would help smaller people aquire a ton of items from the players trying to fund themselves the plat to step through. <P><b><i>Definitely a good money sink. Our final decision was that we wanted to try and maintain each server as a real community, where people on that server have earned their way into its history. This would yeild a place where reputations mean something. <P>Though it is true that the latest moves may have compromised that philosophy a bit, overall it's still looking good. </b></i><P>I know, this would take some seriously insane coding .. <P><b><I>And oh, you are right about that.

Gordon Wrinn talked about PvP on the Gameplay board today.  Here's the post:<UL><I>We're actually going to be shutting down the PvP thread here in the near future, probably before we release the expansion. Though I've seen many good suggestions, the majority are things that would require too much work for the possible benefit. Of the easier to implement suggestions, I liked the idea of experience loss on death more than anything, but I have to acknowledge that there's no way that a reasonable percentage of players on the PvP server would agree with it.<P>We are planning on allowing people to move between Tallon and Vallon Zek, probably after the expansion is released. Since those two servers came up at roughly the same time, there aren't any worries about affecting their respective economies. <P>We also still plan to change the /con message so that you don't get an indication of level for anyone that you can attack. If they are in your level range, they'll just /con even. <P>That's about it.<P>-Gordon</I></UL>

Some character naming issues came up on the boards today.  Here's the thread from the Gameplay board in which Gordon responds:<UL>I tried to ask him about the fact that this was Double Jeapordy. There is no possible way anyone BUT a GM could have granted me the apostrophe in my name. <P><b><i>A Senior Guide also has the ability to set special last names. But regardless who did it (GM or SG), they apparently were mistaken. It's happened before. <P>The reason that your name was changed was not related to the apostrophe, but the name itself. Please allow me to quote a section of the naming policy that deals specifically with your issue: <P>----SNIP----<br>Non-words like--D, Da, De, Di, El, Z, Za, Ze, Zi, L, Le, La, Li are unacceptable in cases where the name contains a normal word, as they are references to "The" and implicate a title, in both cases (e.g. D`Kval is acceptable where D`Basher is not).<br>----SNIP---- <P>The name-change itself was warranted, but I would hope that a GM would do a better job of explaining the reason the change is needed than it appears was explained to you.<P> -Gordon</b></i></UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Good grief has Gordon been busy today.  In the past 24 hours Mr. Wrinn has made over 60 posts on the Gameplay board alone.  Here's a rundown of some of his latest:<UL><b>Quest Structure</b><br>We're not at all opposed to quests giving out real (e.g. tangible) experience, however that's really not going to be possible given the current architecture. The problem is that we need to have the ability to store completion-info as part of the character. This would keep the same character from doing the same quest over and over again, which is what keeps us from doing things like giving out half-a-level for a tough quest. Tracking this unfortunately isn't possible without doing a player-wipe. The Quest engine could be improved in many other ways, but they all require the ability to know exactly what a character has or has not done. <P><b>Hybrid Debate</b> (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/028515.html">Click here</a> for original post)<br>Wow! These are probably some of the best arguments I've seen. I am impressed...however... <P>Hybrids don't get teleports, not even Gate. Only two classes get teleports, and even though rangers are a hybrid of one of those classes, there's really no compelling reason to make an exception.<P><b>Money and the PoS</b><br>If you are paying 3Kpp per person to go to the Plane of Sky, there's only one reason: You want to. The zone need not cost a cent after the first trip in. Deaths can be handled with resurrect. Heck, you can even get by a few of the key requirements using death, resurrect, and summon-corpse (this one costs money though). <P>Now of course if you want to bring more people than there are keys, or skip by the first island, it's going to cost you. We want the Plane of Sky to remain challenging regardless of how many warm bodies you can throw at it.<P><b>Skill Caps and Individuality</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: What about giving characters one generic skillcap point per level that they could assign to any skill? Or&#8230; implement some quests that can raise skillcaps for different skills.  A 50th level character could have assigned 50 skillcap points to one skill raising its effectiveness by 10 levels. If this is too much there could be a skillcap addition cap for certain skills.]</i><P>First, just because you stop gaining in a particular skill doesn't mean that your skill level does not go up. For instance, a level 50 person with a 200 skill in 1HS does not hit like a level 40 person, they hit like a level 50 person because their is more to calculating it than just the skill. <P>Secondly, please keep in mind that all of this stuff is balanced based upon the caps and how they work now. We just can't arbitrarily decide to start letting people increase their skill-caps on a whim. Sure, it would be neat, but since things are currently balanced, the only way that something like this could go in is if we substantially nerfed the skills so that any net gain would be zero. <P>Finally, enabling what you ask for here would not diverse characters. Skill-based systems never do. Everyone gravitates towards having whatever skills are perceived to be ideal. This has been persistent flaw in every skill-based MMORPG architecture that has been developed. That&#8217;s why we chose to go with a class-based system.<P><b>Drops in PoH</b><br>Just trying to verify your logic: The drop percentages in Hate are low so people with armor in Hate will play longer? I suppose that means that since the drops in Fear are higher, we must want everyone with armor there to quit. <P>Please... We have Hate updated on the Test server and hope to patch it live the next time we do data. Probably next week.<P><b>Bonus Skill Points</b><br>Well I can say that we don't have any intention of including bonus points. It's certainly possible for people to work up any skills that they need, the inclusion of more points would just serve to save them some time, and go a long way towards making point meaningless in the first place. Save them up!<P><b>Kunark and International Orders</b><br>Our plan is to have the Expansion in everyone's hands prior to the official launch, even the overseas people. That's our plan, and it is looking good so far. However we really won't be able to nail it down further for a bit yet.<P><b></b> (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029398.html">Click here</a> for original post)<br>Unfortunately, this is the way resurrection works, and it's not considered a bug. If the resurrection doesn't go through on the first time for whatever reason (e.g. Zone, cancel, LD, etc.), the experience cannot be restored. <br><i>[Quote from original post: I disagree with the behavior not being considered a bug. A res should give the exp, period. No, two reses should NOT give any more exp than one res.]</i><P> I understand your opinion, however when making coding decisions, the programmers have to decide how many contingencies they are willing to trap. There are functions that you can perform in the game that account for all different kinds of things that can go wrong, such as everything that can go wrong in a trade. <P>Resurrection is one of those things where not everything possible is trapped. It makes resurrection fairly black-and-white, but has the side-effect of missing them under certain circumstances. <P><b>Resurrection Bug</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: I too recently lost the exp from missing the first res attempt. What happened was, I was waiting a while on the cleric to med and res, and going through inventory. The window popped up as I clicked on an inventory item - and clicking on the item made the res window disappear!!]</i><P> Yeah, I'll buy that that is a bug with the confirmation-box code. You would think that a confirmation box wouldn't disappear unless you actually click on something. In *most* cases, it's safe to assume the answer is "NO", which is how the item-destroy confirmation works, but I can see this being a problem in reference to a resurrect. I'm not sure if this can be worked around, but I'll bring it to the Team.<P><b>Fear and Charm in PvP</b><br>Fear and Charm spells have been disabled in the PvP environment for some time due to abuses that surround them. They made it possible for all kinds of bad things to happen, including intentionally causing experience loss and they allowed people to bypass the PvP level limits. <P>When this was done, AE Fear spells continued to work due to how those spells interact with the players. This latest patch merely fixed that issue, causing PCs to be immune to them as well as the single target spells from before.<P><b>On Reported Bard Bug</b><br>GZ has vowed to take another look at it, though no progress has been made. He's fairly tied up with trying to get the expansion spells in order. Due to the complexity of the spell system, we prefer to have only one person with the ability to modify spells.<P><b>Terms and Phrases</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Just time for another "pop" word I think...."Uber-guild" is dead....both the word and the definition.]</i><P>Hmmm... <br><br>Overguild<br>Superguild<br>Surguild<br>Pas Sous Guild<br>Powerguild<br>Capo-guild<br>Bossguild<br>|3W|_guild<br>Getsmolewtguild<br> <br>Hmmm... Maybe we should just stick with Uberguild<P><b>Pro Asheron's Call Posts on the Official Boards</b><br>We really don't mind seeing the posts on the board proclaiming one game better than another. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and that opinion means so much more when it is tested. It's one thing for us to talk about the positive aspects of EQ when people haven't tried another game. It's another thing when they've tried the other games and then affirmatively choose EQ. <P>Thank you for continuing to choose EQ.<P><b>Magician Spells</b><br>Breaking a moment from not speaking about 50+ spells, I'd like to say that magicians will keep Malosi, it just won't be as a level 49 spell. <P><b>DoT Spells</b><br>There's a difference between having one message that's sent to one person, and having one message that's broadcast to several. For things like Taunt and Spell damage, it would result in an increase of network traffic that would be problematic :(<P><b>Do Celebirties Play EQ?</b><br>I've wondered this many times myself. I'd heard that a mainstream band interviewed in a popular music rag once stated that they spent their spare time playing EQ. I'm sure there are other celeb's playing, and wouldn't mind knowing for personal reasons. They can feel free to email me at gwrinn@verant.com if they like, and I'll even see about getting a signed poster out :)<P><b>Charm Bug</b> (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029409.html">Click here</a> for original post)<br>Indeed a bug, and easy to understand when you know how this stuff works. I'll forward it to the test team.<P><b>More on DoTs</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: When it breaks fear tho the mob runs for me at full normal speed, as for some weird reason whenever fear is broken or wears off, the movement inhibiting portion of the "darkness" line of dots seems to wear off as well.]</i><P> This definitely isn't as designed, nor is it as I've observed myself. I'd suggest you try some extensive testing to see if it&#8217;s truly the case. If this did go in at some time it was accidental. Can anyone confirm or deny this behavior?<P><P><b>What about Pet Bashing in this patch?</b><br>Well it's not just pets, it's all NPCs are refusing to bash without a shield. And yes, that will be corrected in this patch.<P><b>Can EQ Be Made Into a Better game?</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: At this point in development, with EQ having been out for a year and over 200,000 installed copies of it on the market Verant would be making a bad business choice to rework every system that we, as players, recommend to them to be changed.]</i><P> That's something that we struggle with here on a near-daily basis, and it comes up every time we discuss any planned enhancement or "nerf" to any particular aspect of the game: Do the ends justify the means. Will the changes we are considering really do anything for the game? Will it make people stay longer? Will it prompt them to quit sooner? Will the people who will stay longer make up for all the people that will quit instantly because of a specific change? Do we really want to risk making vast sweeping changes to an already successful game? <P>In a system with over 200K active subscribers, we can pretty much bet that any change we make to the game will cause people to quit sooner, stay longer, quit instantly, resubscribe, and do nothing at all. All of these actions are represented. <P>So, to the people who think that we just run around arbitrarily making changes to the game, I'd like to point out that there is a whole lot more to it than that.<P><b>The Odds</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone have the odds that the servers will be down for more then 2 hours.]</i><P>I'll give 3:1 again :)<P><b>Casters realm reports that all of the dot spells now give messages when they wear off - True?</b><br>I can confirm this. I believe that someone suggested it on the boards yesterday, and I said I'd take it to the team. Well the programmer who does things like that regularly reads the board here. He grabbed it and ran with it. <P>The technology that lets us report when charm and fear wears off is what let us do this fairly easily. <P>One additional note that's not mentioned at castersrealm is that pets should now tell their owners when a beneficial spell wears off. <P><b>EverQuest and Realism</b><br>Sometimes we have to put some limitations on realism for the sake of gameplay. This takes many forms, some of which are considered both good and bad. As an example, it's "unrealistic" for someone to heal from near-dead to full simply by sitting on your can for 20 minutes. Even in game-time, that only accounts for about 8 hours. Embracing realism in this case would lead to tedium in the game. <P>The same philosophy is true for things such as archery. Though realistically, a person with a really good bow could kill something in but a few shots, from a gameplay standpoint that would be too powerful. Though tedium isn't an issue with this, the sanctity and meaning of gameplay (e.g. challenge) is at stake. <P><b>GM Events Involving City Assaults</b><br>We'd like to see it too, and have tried it on occasion. Unfortunately it's always followed by people coming to the boards and complaining how we get our kicks out of killing newbies. After about the 3rd or 4th time we decided to reevaluate our plans and try to hold these types of things at least one zones from a newbie zone.<P><b>Posion Update</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Can us rogues expect to see comments regarding the poison changes?]</i><P>Comments as in "When will they be done?" or comments addressing "What will they consist of?" <P>To the former, we've got it set for post-expansion right now. I posted in another thread about it today: <P>---SNIP---<br><i>[Quote from original post: I don't suppose any rogue changes were put in? </i><P>Nothing in this patch specifically addressed the rogue class. As far as what we have planned, we're still planning an update for poison, but that's looking to be post-expansion now. Doing a worthwhile update for poison is far more difficult than putting in something like Evade or the hide/sneak/undead thing. It will take a good deal of effort to get it right.<br>---SNIP--- <P>As for the latter, we're still working on that. All I can say is that it is supposed to be "cool" :)<P><P><b>Pet Bug Overview</b><br>NPCs (pets included) have always had the ability to bash (slam) without having a shield equipped. The ability was accidently removed in the patch last Friday, and was put back in in the patch today. <P><b>Expansion Skills for Melee</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: What's up with them? Have they already been selected, coded, and finalized (I hope so, release is but a few precious weeks away, but then again... -bah, this isn't a flame, but a qustion) All the casters have their rumored new spells posted on every EQ board from here to Kaladim, but what about the new melee skills?]</i><P> They've been coded and are currently undergoing balance tests on the Test server. We just aren't ready to release any specific information about them. As for the spell info that's out there, there wasn't much we could do about that. We're just not commenting on them either, and have thrown in a few red herrings to keep people guessing.<br>--<br>All of the melee classes are getting new abilities post-50. Though I wouldn't classify them as skills (a skill being something that you must train up, whereas abilities are semi-innate). We do not, however, wish to comment on any specifics in regards to them at this time.<P><b>Harmony and Feign Death</b><br>Harmony and Feign Death cannot be compared directly. The spell and skill have two completely different uses. Harmony, for instance, is an outdoor-only offensive spell, and Feign Death is an escape skill that works everywhere.<P><b>Rogue Changes?</b><br>Nothing in this patch specifically addressed the rogue class. As far as what we have planned, we're still planning an update for poison, but that's looking to be post-expansion now. Doing a worthwhile update for poison is far more difficult than putting in something like Evade or the hide/sneak/undead thing. It will take a good deal of effort to get it right.</UL>

Gordon posted the following on the Gameplay board this afternoon:<UL><i>The bad news is that we need to bring the servers down for about an hour shortly to deal with some stability issues introduced with the last patch. It will be quick, but you know how we hate to bring them down for any reason outside the normal scheduled outage period.<P>The good news is that as part of this patch, we've fixed the "warp on flee" bug that plagues many areas of the game. In some zones, NPCs will warp-off somewhere when they turn to flee. They tend to come back at nearly full health, usually leading a nice train behind them. They'll no longer warp when fleeing.<P>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon responded twice to a few posts regarding one of his previous posts concerning an email scam and not giving away user info.  Here's the first clip:<UL>Actually, Verant's own Guide program application requires you to type in your station name and password to enter an application... it would be very easy to design a site that is a fake "guide application"... so yes, in fact, Verant CAN ask for your name and password, just not directly in Email... didn't think of that?<P><b><I>Actually that's not true. Though the guide application does ask for *A* password, it specifically states that the password that you give should be different from your login password.<P>So yes, we thought of that.<P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the second post:<UL>Correct me if I'm wrong, but the FIRST time you go to CREATE your guide app, you must put in your REAL EQ Login name and REAL password. AFTER that, when you get to the screen to create your app, you are allowed to specify your NON-LOGIN EQ password as something different. <P><b><I>No, when you first go there you can enter any password that you like. However looking at the site, I can understand how it would lead people to believe that they have to put their actual password. I'll work on getting this clarified on the site. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Another email scam is going around.  Gordon spoke about it today on the Gameplay board:<UL><i>We just received word of yet another scam directed at EQ customers attempting to get them to send their passwords and login information to parties impersonating Verant personnel. I would like to stress as firmly as possible that no Verant, Sony, nor 989 Studios representative will *ever* ask you for your password, or request that you change your password to a specified string. <P>Furthermore, any official communications will come from the verant.com or station.sony.com domains. We never use free email accounts provided by any of the free email providers on the web. <P>I'm beginning to believe that people are perpetuating these scams in order to get some sick sense of accomplishment by seeing their scam-email posted on the front page of news sites. I'll therefore ask that news sites no longer post those actual emails when issuing the warnings, and instead opt to just summarize them. Please do not be fooled by these scams. <P>-Gordon</i></UL>

It's druid only, 1h slash, 8 dmg 25 delay +9 wis +4 agil and weighs 3.5, no drop, magic, lore, with a Thorncoat effect. Also when you wield it it looks like a runed falchion, only with a light tan tint. <P>The quest is tough. There's a wandering rare NPC in W Karana. I forget his first name but his last name was Oaksword. I found him wandering around sort of near the ogres, but a bit south of them, seemed to be on the same route as the ghoul messenger (so maybe the ghoul is his placeholder). He just happened to appear on track so I went to check him out. <P>What you need basically is the Solvedi Scimitar and the Treant Staff, both quests in Rathe Mtns. Then you need the testimony & the head of a fallen druid, named Jordynn or something like that, who is a new rare spawn in SK now.<P> Turn these 4 items in to him and you'll get the scim. Luckily I did the solvedi scim and treant staff quest long ago and had them wasting away in my bank. Jordynn I found in SK sort of near the pyramid. I think maybe talking to Oaksword made him spawn since I've spent lots of time in SK with many different characters and never ever saw him before. Jordynn coned blue at 48 and was pretty nasty.. I'd say a 45ish druid, but I had a full group and we were able to take him down :) <P>I have screenshots of what he was saying that you can see at <a href="http://www.tarewmarr.net/shots/oak.jpg">http://www.tarewmarr.net/shots/oak.jpg</a> and also one of me holding the scim at <a href="http://www.tarewmarr.net/shots/scim.jpg">http://www.tarewmarr.net/shots/scim.jpg</a> <P>So, go get one :)</BLOCKQUOTE>Wow, everyone must check this out!
