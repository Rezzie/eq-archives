I think what /potency would do is cause powergamers to try to roleplay.]</i></font> <br><br>/em cheers! <br><br>That's the point of rewarding success rather than punishing failure. As a roleplayer you want powergamers to try to roleplay. If roleplaying gives rewards then more people will do it. Isn't the most common complaint from roleplayers that those around them are not roleplaying and are breaking the fiction? <br><br>So, while the mechanism might seem somehow wrong, the results are good. A lot of people that are 'power gamers' have never roleplayed. I've seen a few people that were once power gamers learn to love roleplaying once they had a chance to actually do it. <br><br>The whole point that I was making with the idea of rewards as opposed to punishments was that this is the best method for teaching. And teaching people to roleplay should be at least part of the goal of a server dedicated to roleplaying. <br><br>Though, unfortunately, the whole 'potency' idea would really require too much coding to be workable. But it is most certainly a step in the right direction. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: one that I would guess would be unlikely, I think, due to difficulty in storing the info]</i></font> <br><br>Exactly. We can't have NPCs trying to store data about every PC that they've ever encountered&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think any reward system that could be made would be unable to properly reward someone playing a very gruff fighter (says only "No" "Go away" "Yes" & "How much").]</i></font> <br><br>Hehe. I call that the RPGA sickness. The outgoing, funny, talkative character will always win if a vote is taken about which was 'best' at roleplaying. The RPGA (at least back when I was still going to game conventions) has players vote to see who was 'best' at roleplaying. As a player, I often play the 'gruff' character. For example, I played a character that was an 'ice queen' sort, as described by the sheet they gave me. A friend played an outgoing Gnome. Between us we got most of the votes at the table. I was picked #1 by the GM and by my friend. He was picked #1 by all the rest. I was #2 for most people. He might be a better roleplayer, I can't deny that. But I know if I played the comical character I would have been chosen best. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Also, I think that roleplayers will roleplay regardless of whether or not there are in-game benefits (and regardless of most penalties, too). I think the only real rewards for roleplaying are in the act itself, and in having others roleplay (in other words, the gain is in fun!).]</i></font> <br><br>That really is the point. Roleplayers will just roleplay. The rewards and/or punishments are not for the roleplayers. They are to encourage those that normally would not, or to discourage those that don't. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Without the flavor of RL, Player A (especially if new to the game) could take this insult personally.]</i></font> <br><br>True. And a note to the effect that people should not take in-character insults personally would be nice. Also, a note that people should try to keep the in-character insults mild or obviously in-character (use a /tell to talk to the player telling him that you're just roleplaying, no offense intended). A roleplayer won't be offended by what is said or done to him in game, not on a personal level. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Part of the fun in tabletop games is joking around with friends while you play. In EQ it is difficult to tell jokes while RPing. Typing "OOC" with every say gets old (esp. in a string of jokes), but without it, it can be difficult to differentiate.]</i></font> <br><br>That's what I use /groupsay for now. /gsay is an out of character channel (since it's not justified in the context of the game), and I use it to blab all my ooc jokes and snide comments. I try to use /say whenever talking in character. <br><br>MorgsEQ wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) I would see GMs take a much more active role in this area especially.]</i></font> <br><br>This is the tricky part, but the most important part too. <br><br>People flinch when they hear that a GM controlled character killed someone. For some reason some people take it personally when a GM uses an NPC to kill their character (even if that same NPC would have killed them without the GM). I'm not saying that having GMs involved in the game world more is all about combat, obviously it's not. But that is where some people have a hang-up. <br><br>In a way, the promise of more frequent GM involvement might be enough of a deterrent for those that don't want to roleplay. Keep in mind that the GM in a roleplaying game really needs to have some serious control over the environment. Right now that GM is primarily the server. Moving that responsibility to a person means more interesting interaction, and more room for human error (and negative response to those errors). <br><br>But there's a bigger issue here, that's man-hour (people-hours?). Running 'events' is time consuming. Our current GM staff is more than busy enough with petitions&#8230; <br><br>*shrug* <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'm not sure why you think this way, but I'll assume that by self-consistent you mean self controlled or directed?]</i></font> <br><br>I mean internally consistent. A world where some people just can't cause any harm to some other people in the world is extremely inconsistent. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I've also paid attention to the server population and the PvP servers are normally the least populated. That tells me that RPers in EQ 1) don't wish to participate in PvP and 2) being self-consistent isn't working or hasn't evolved on the PvP servers. Yet we would want to create new untried PvP rules and implement them on an RP server when you already have 3 broken PvP servers now?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, option 3) is more likely. 3) PvP rules on those servers aren't that well thought out and need to be revised. Some code issues break the PvP game and need to be repaired. The lack of success on those servers does not necessarily mean that PvP is a bad concept. And, heck, it might very well be that there are more people actually 'roleplaying' on PvP servers than on any other server. <br><br>*shrug* <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But to try and answer the PvP question. I would say you can't. 1) Because you can't control what the individual who just killed you says before, during, and after. 2) For the same reasons you can't make it appear that everyone is role-playing. 3) Because the method is controlled by your code, but the action and person to person interactive results are controlled by the individuals. You can only _encourage_ players to kill for RP reasons.]</i></font> <br><br>Unfortunately, you could apply those three comments to any portion of roleplaying. Apply them to grouping, apply them to chat channels, apply them to anything, and they are equally out of our control. You're right, we can't control what someone says after he kills you. But we also can't control what he says as he steals your kill. We can't make it appear that anyone is roleplaying, PvP or not. We can't control the interactions of people. We can only encourage. That applies to the whole concept of a 'roleplaying' server. And I'm not going accept that as a reason to not try. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: IMO you might have served the situation better if you'd asked for discussion on Brad's suggestions, but again that's just my opinion.]</i></font> <br><br>People seemed to be all talked out about Brad's ideas. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And finally also IMO the simple fact that you came here and promoted the pvp idea gives the _perception_ that PvP is the preferred method that Verant wishes to implement.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, that perception is unfounded. I made it very clear that that was my personal opinion. I also didn't say that I thought it was the best way to handle it in EverQuest (or any MMORPG for that matter). I just stated my thoughts, not company policy. <br><br>Dachannien wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: To set up my explanation, let me first say that I have no lack of confidence that, given a mostly-roleplaying player base on a server, those few that decide to play on the server but don't roleplay will end up shunned by the player base and will have great difficulties moving up in the game. This is as it should be. A roleplaying server, in terms of actually enforcing roleplaying, should depend on its player base to make critical assessments of whether a person is truly roleplaying (or trying their heart out, at the very least, though roleplaying isn't difficult) or not.]</i></font> <br><br>Hey Dach. Keep in mind that people claim that the best way to police a PvP server is by letting the players do it. I'm not convinced that this works, because there is no rule that says that the majority of the population (or the most power) will be people playing the 'right' way. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But to achieve that sort of self-regulation requires that the player base is mostly roleplayers in the first place.]</i></font> <br><br>See! :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Okay, if, on the other hand, there *are* penalties and limitations that make it more difficult for the non-roleplayer as compared to other servers (the Warrens Loot rules, for example, or the chat/language limitations), which do you think the k3wld00d will choose? ]</i></font> <br><br>Don't get me wrong here. I understand the value of deterrents in this system. It's just that it is always easier to come up with deterrents and punishments in a game like this than it is to come up with rewards that can't be abused. That's why I wanted to see discussion on it. Not because deterrents won't work, but because they are easier. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And as far as rewards go... the rewards for roleplaying are inherent to roleplaying. Roleplaying is fun. Fun is a reward. Therefore, roleplaying is its own reward.]</i></font> <br><br>Darn tootin'! <br><br>ThibbledorfThunder wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The logic behind doing this is to encourage people to use PvP switch if they are willing to engage other players in battle. This is not a liscence to kill anything that moves. It simply makes the option more viable. Keep in mind PvP does not mean an end to PvE.]</i></font> <br><br>This sounds suspiciously like /duel&#8230; <br><br>Old_Michael wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Require the players file an in-character application of some sort.]</i></font> <br><br>Very, very time consuming. Keep in mind that for every person you see playing on a server now there might be 3 or 4 at work or eating dinner or whatever. And each player on a server might have as many as 8 characters. I've thought of this idea before, and the time required to read those applications would just be overwhelming. <br><br>Thanks for the comments all, I'll popping back in Monday to see what there is to see.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066899-2.html"><b>Security at EQ Gathering</b></a><br>I'm not at all worried about trouble at a gathering. <br><br>Sorry, but I'm going to close this one down.

But there is a problem: How do you achieve that goal? <br><br>Let us assume that there is a simple quest that, for example, required a large number of people to go defeat a monster and bring something back. The reason that it requires a lot of people is that the monster is mind-numbingly hard to kill. So the reward is going to be excellent. <br><br>This is a simple quest. The trick is, how do you make the same quest more time consuming and just as difficult (to warrant the same reward), but only requires six people to accomplish?

I've seen it in just about every 'roleplaying server' discussion in the history of EverQuest (forgive my upcoming generalizations). Whether consciously or not, what a lot of people ask for in a roleplaying server are rules that, essentially, punish people that don't roleplay. I understand the idea. Set up the rules so only those that want to roleplay will enjoy the experience. This generally means making it so that things that roleplayers 'shouldn't' do are punished (for example, a penalty for a paladin grouping with a shadowknight). <br><br>I want to urge you to think along a different line. Think along the lines of rewarding those that do roleplay (or acts that fit within the concept), rather than punishing those that don't. Obviously there are cases where this won't work. But it is much easier to include rules that reward an activity than those that punish, mostly from a philosophical standpoint. <br><br>I am one of those people that believes that in order for a setting to be as self-consistent as possible the characters must have the ability to interact with each other as much as possible. In EverQuest that means PvP. <br><br>I am also aware that there is a perception that it is acceptable to be killed by someone that is acting in-character and unacceptable to be killed by someone acting out of character. This seems to be, by far, the largest stumbling block for people when it comes to including PvP combat on a 'roleplaying' server. <br><br>So, how would we implement PvP on a roleplaying server in such a way that all PvP interaction would at least seem to be in character? This is, of course, a lofty goal. But why not shoot for the stars. <br><br>And, by the way, I am expressing my opinions here. I am not even hinting that there will be such a server. I am only looking for ideas&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069890.html"><b>On Wolf Form</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I always thought it was disconcerting that when you attack as a wolf in 1st person perspective, you can occasionally see your own teeth.]</i></font> <br><br>And Trolls can see their noses... <br><br>I can't really see this as a high priority item. But I'll mention it to the team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/070030.html"><b>Server-side Filteres on Test</b></a><br>Let me try to explain the whole 'server side filtering' thing. Bear with me, I don't fully understand how it will work yet. I'll probably get some of this wrong and I'll be back to update later with corrections. :)<br><br>Chat channels are just text. Filtering them out server-side is not critical, and might not have too much of an effect on bandwidth usage. <br><br>The important stuff that is sent to the client are damage messages and such. <br><br>There is a standard update to all clients every six seconds on hit points for group members and NPCs. But you also get an update from the server when you get a damage message. So if I'm attacking an Orc I'm going to get an update on the Orc's hit points every six seconds. But if I hit the Orc with my sword I also get a message saying something like "Absor hits the Orc for 3 points of melee damage". That message also updates the client. If one of my group members takes a hit from the Orc, the message "Bob takes 4 points of damage" is also an update for my client so that I can see a reduction of Bob's hit point bar on my client. <br><br>Turning off Other's Hits, for example, as a server-side function would mean that I wouldn't see that update. So when my pal Bob hits the Orc for 2 points of damage, my client will not know this right away. It will get updated when the next standard update is sent (as much as six seconds later). Filtering NPC hits would have the same effect on updates to the hit points for your party members. Basically, filtering this stuff server-side means as much as a six second delay (in a perfect lagless Internet) in updates to your client for data that some classes might consider critical. <br><br>We have options to improve this, however. <br><br>Obviously NOT turning certain filters on solves the problem on an individual basis. Of course, if people are not filtering stuff then moving filters server-side isn't going to do too much good. <br><br>We might decrease the time between the basic updates, but this would increase bandwidth dramatically for everyone and could defeat the whole purpose of the project. <br><br>We might have the servers update certain items more frequently, such as the hit points of whatever you have targeted, or the hit points of your group members. <br><br>Or some combination of these or other options. <br><br>But here is the most important point. We MUST introduce this in stages. There is no way that our Test server can be a good test bed for something like this. One server can't match the data output of 30. And we obviously don't want this server-side filtering to suddenly cause people to drop off servers all over the place. So we need to be very cautious with this implementation. <br><br>The first stages are in the works on Test now, as you know. When we move this live we will be doing so in a way that will give us the best savings on bandwidth. This means that when it goes live turning on certain filters will reduce the updates on certain things to those six-second general updates. So if you want to reduce the data flowing to your computer, expect to see fewer updates on NPC hit points and group hit points. That's as planned. <br><br>Once we have an idea how much bandwidth server-side filtering is saving us, then we can start to add features. But we'll be doing so very slowly so that we can judge the affects. When it's all over, we think this should be a boon for those in high traffic situations or those that don't have the best connections to our servers (already on Test we're hearing from people that could never hang in on a raid that don't get dropped all night with these changes). But you'll have to bear with us while we move this into production.</UL>

Also, holding down the shift+home or shift+end will take your cursor all the way to the beginning or end of your chat message.<br><br>There was a bug with assist in that you couldn't type /assist then someone's partial name.  This is now fixed.  This only affected Test Server.<br><br><br>March 21st, 12:00pm<br>-------------------------<br>Previously messages such as OOC, Shout, Auction, Spells, and combat messages were only filtered by the client. Meaning that you would still receive the message from the servers, but it would not be displayed. We have made some changes so that now OOC, Shout, Auction, damage shields, and all combat MISS messages are automatically filtered by the server if you have them turned off. This should dramatically reduce the amount of data you receive from the server during intense combat.<br>In addition to this change, we have added the command /serverfilter. This command when used with the ON parameter will filter messages such as spells, bard songs, and HIT messages on the server. This should one again increase the stability of your connection to the server. However, one side affect of filtering these messages is that you may not see NPC spell effects, PC and NPC hit animations, and NPC/PC hit sounds. Please use accordingly.<br><br>Because of these message changes, the command /assist had be altered. It should now be more reliable.<br>A bug was fixed where Iksar Monks could not feign after they foraged.<br><br>Money once placed in a trade window can no longer be removed unless the trade is canceled by either party.</UL>Thank you for letting me know Ronane!

Brad "Aradune" McQuaid visited the Gameplay Board several times over the last few days.  Here's the complete scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069369.html"><b>Aradune Q&A Session, Pt. 2</b></a><br>RunDMZ: I'm still reading, but very busy, so I'm not sure when I'll have more time to respond to many of these. <br><br>Also, most of the posts are either agreeing, or disagreeing, with what's already been said. That, or an attempt to get across very specific class agendas (which really belong in other threads).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069619.html"><b>EQ Going The Way of the Dodo?</b></a><br>Actually, comparing EQ to other games, and going over the positives and negatives, and different approaches and philosophies is fine. <br><br>Please, though, I hope nobody viloates their NDAs that exist with some of these games in beta. <br><br>Anyway, the description you gave of AO is so general, as noted by Logan9, that it doesn't really separate itself from other games (or promises of other games) that are either out or coming out (I'm not saying the game's do or don't -- just the description you gave). <br><br>First, a skill based system (no classes). Actually, EQ is in the minority here -- most MMOGs use or intend to use skill based systems. This could be a thread unto itself, going over the advantages and disadvantages of class vs. skill systems. IMHO, they both have their plusses and minuses, and here at Verant/SOE, we're working on some games that are class based and others skill based. In a nutshell, classes are easier to balance and easier to create interdependece with. But they are also less flexible, and they can be more prone to 'class envy' issues after launch. Skill systems, on the other hand, are more flexible, but harder to balance, and can lead to 'tank mage syndromes' and serious lack of interdependence problems. Also, if complex enough, they can intimidate new users. (For the future, we've some ideas on several of our products, to address the deficiencies of both systems, as I'm sure our competitors do as well). <br><br>No camping and random spawns... well, again, this is pretty general. We've tried to do more randomization recently, and with decent success. The trick is, IMHO, to reduce camping but not have so much randomness that you lose context, storyline, and setting. And, again, this could be a huge thread too :)<br><br>Ah, the solo vs. group issue. I've really yet to see this one solved. It's pretty tough, because first you want to encourage grouping and interdependence because it forms bonds and community, which are vital in MMOGs. Second, if you create something challenging for one player, a group of players will demolish the encounter. The solution is probably to somehow make sure you've content for both, but of course the reward for the 'solo' encounter cannot be nearly as great as the reward for the 'group' encounter. This is another great topic for debate. <br><br>And no comment on customer service -- first, it's a beta and there aren't a lot of people involved, and second, people have all sorts of different ideas as to what customer service is, what to expect, etc.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069321.html"><b>The Aradune Q&A Chat</b></a><br>No, honestly, I was sober :)<br><br>I was just up that night, reading, and saw the initial post that started it all, asserting that the chat with me was sugar coated and that we're not blunt and up front and honest when we communicate... <br><br>And I guess I was just in one of those moods where somebody thinking something about me/us that just isn't true bothered me enough to stay up the next 6 or so hours and post like a madman :)<br><br>I think it's probably a character flaw, that I care so much when someone thinks something negative of me that isn't true... I mean, if someone's upset about something that is true, then it's ok -- sometimes people just need to agree to disagree. <br><br>But I know how much my teams care about this game, and how hard they work, and how much we listen to and care about our customer base and their happiness, and how difficult it can be to make some of the hard decisions we occasionally do to safeguard the long term health of the game... <br><br>And, so, sometime's a criticism/flame/troll whatever that implies something contrary to what we so deeply care about just sets me off... <br><br>In general, Absor and the other community relations people are instructed to not 'fan the flames', so to speak... and I typically try to do the same thing... but then every once in a while I guess I slip :)<br><br>The reactions have been on both extremes, and everywhere inbetween... many in support, thanking me for being up front, and then others who think I was 'disrespectful' to paying customers. <br><br>In any case, it's not the first time I've stayed up late on a weekend and communicated with as many people on the boards as I could and in a very upfront and honest manner -- if you dig around, you'll probably find other stuff from the past as well :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069084.html"><b>Another Developer's Response To Customer Suggestions</b></a><br>Nrodalog: Wow, thanks for posting this. Boy are the parallels uncanny, eh? :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069048.html"><b>Roleplaying Server</b></a><br>"1. Implement Trivial Combat code everywhere" <br><br>"What the heck does this have to do with Roleplay? Yes, if you re-configured the loot tables for the whole game it *might* work, but it has absolutely nothing to do with roleplaying. No role-playing game ever had the loot "disapear" if the person who killed it was too poweful." <br><br>See, people disagree on what RP is, and isn't. <br><br>In any case, I'll explain why I think removing bottom feeding has a LOT to do with RP. When I'm in a dungeon adventuring and I encounter farmers and other characters too high level, it abruptly and forcefully removes me from suspension of disbelief -- it severely damagers the immersiveness of the game. And I think that's directly tied to RP, just as some guy using d00d speak hurts an RP environment, or seeing a Troll ally with a Paladin. <br><br>In D&D, it just wouldn't be allowed. No DM worth his salt would allow a group of level 8 players to slaughter through a level 2 module... and even worse, to allow another low level group in the module simultaneously. <br><br>Or how about from fantasy literature... how 'RP' would it have been if, as the hobbits were fighting against goblins and wolves, they rounded a bend in the forest to find a group of Valar slaugtering the evil denziens with blinks of their eyes? <br><br>"4. Disallow Paladins grouping with Shadow Knights, etc." <br><br>"Well there are some RP +S and -s to this. For one thing, clerics are both good and evil, why not paladins? The 'sks are anti-paladins' are ok I guess, but the point is, if the god allows clerics to heal - why wouldn't he have his own "paladin-type" of healing warriors? Also, some gods seem to be neutral (they have both good and evil followers), I'm not sure its paladins wouldn't be "ok" with grouping with SKs. Overall its an ok idea though." <br><br>The paladin/sk bit was just an example... I'd also apply it to clerics who follow opposing gods, etc. <br><br><br>"Your opinion Mr.Programer is yours, no doubt about it. If they are/were well thought out and prepared for I would like those changes, but several of them have nothing to do with "role-playing". Don't kid yourself." <br><br>I disagree, and I think that even though we disagree, both of our opinions are valid, and neither of us are 'kidding' ourselves. <br><br>By the way, I'll hereby slightly adjust our opinion as it relates to an RP server... <br><br>Now that we have so many servers, perhaps it wouldn't be so dangerous to set up a server with a slightly different ruleset and call it an RP server... even though many, many would disagree with the ruleset (whether it was fair, or truly RP, or whatever), there are perhaps enough people now who play this game that we could fill the server... <br><br>Anyway, just some thoughts... We'll think on it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069003.html"><b>The Warrens</b></a><br>One of the core ideas behind the trivial combat code is to enable us to entice low and mid level players into low and mid level dungeons without fear of bottomfeeding.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069024.html"><b>Five Important Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. How's life? <br>2. If it's so good why are you sitting at home responding to flames? :)<br>3. When's EQ7 coming out? <br>4. Did you think this post was a bigger waste of time then if I'd asked a 'serious' (ha) question? <br>5. How many people do you think will tell my to shut up in this thread? I say 7.]</i></font><br><br>Heh. <br><br>1. Overall, very good :)  Things are going very well for Verant/SOE, our games are coming a long great, and we're in a position to really lead this emerging genre (MMOGs) for quite some time, which is exactly what I personally want to be involved in. <br><br>2. That's a really good question. I guess it's because some idealistic and perhaps naive part of me truly wants to believe these boards could be made better. That, and because I've a character flaw such that when someone thinks something bad about me, my teams, my company, etc. that isn't accurate, it BUGS THE HECK OUT OF ME. In other words, if someone doesn't like something we do that we believe is the right thing to do, then that's fine... we listen, and sometime's have to agree to disagree. But when some people assert that we don't care, or are dishonest, or are just out to make a buck, or that we don't listen, or that we don't want to make a great game that appeals to all sorts of people (all of which are patently false)... well, it gets under my skin. Which is why, honestly, I don't post much. And it's also probably what made Abashi get more and more upset over time. And it's probably what's making even Absor, one of the most mellow, even tempered, and polite people I know get a bit edgy in some posts as of late. And which is why we are seriously debating shutting these boards down. <br><br>3. Well, assuming it takes approximatley 3 years to make an MMORPG, and assuming a good one can entertain people for more than 3 years (take a look at UO -- fantastic game, and still going strong)... how about the year 2037? :)<br><br>4. Nah :)<br><br>5. Oh, I think 7 is a far too conservative guess :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069002.html"><b>Gameplay Board To Shut Down?</b></a><br>I do want to stress, again, that if we do shut down the boards, that we will make sure there is still a very real and hopefully even more useful 2 way path of communication between us and the playerbase. <br><br>We've no intention of losing the great feedback and ideas we've received thus far from our playerbase, nor the information we provide to our playerbase.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068929.html"><b>Zone to Stoneburnt Mountains Found</b></a><br>This may indeed be the future tunnel that will lead to Stonebrunt -- if people are getting stuck there, we'll look into it and address it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068965.html"><b>Server Side Filters</b></a><br>As a matter of fact, we're working on implementing server-side filtering. <br><br>Let's cross our fingers and hope this helps with large raids and such.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068974.html"><b>Review Of The Warrens</b></a><br>thanks for the comments -- they've been passed on to the Live team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068883.html"><b>Neat Anniversary Stuff</b></a><br>Many of you have already probably noticed this, but for those of you who haven't, there's all sorts of neat EQ 2nd anniversary stuff at<br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com:80/2ndanniversary/index.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com:80/2ndanniversary/index.jsp</a> <br><br>There's some cool concept art, an EQ .avi movie, some Parkinson sketches, chat transcripts, and even a very early build of EverQuest when it was only 5 months old (from August, 1996 when I was still a programmer on the project, and there were only 3 or 4 of us on the whole team)! <br><br>Anyways, check it out :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068889.html"><b>On Tech Questions</b></a><br>We've gone through several times and looked at the max_clip value for each zone, and set that value to the maximum the zone was exported to. <br><br>When the zone was exported from the tool that was used to create the zone, a maximum visibility value was used by the zone creator. Setting the max_clip to beyond that will create all sorts of strange visual artifacts. <br><br>The newer the zone, the farther we typically export the zone's clip at. <br><br>The exception, of course, are zones meant to have limited clipping planes for effect (fog enshrouded forests, under water, etc.). <br><br>I'm sure there may be some zones still out there that could have their max_clip extended even further, meaning we missed them when we went through them all last time. <br><br>There may also be an obscure bug that doesn't always set the client to max_clip even when the slider is set all the way (Darkmatter will attest to this until the end of time :) It may also be possible that when the rain stops, the clip plane moves beyond the max_clip set for that zone, revealing visual artifacts, albeit temporarily. <br><br>Since this comes up occasionally, I'll bring it up again on Monday and have a game designer play with turning rain on and off in the Karanas and/or Qeynos hills, to see if he can get the clip to go beyond what the value is set at in the zone. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068804.html"><b>Trival Combat On All New Servers</b></a><br>This is something we might consider (having the next new non-split server launch with this new ruleset applicable to all zones).</UL>

Assuming it's really as easy as you suggest it is to fix&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: For the person that thinks a 2 hour day is a long day of EQ (the way I was for the first 6-8 months I played), that's crippling.]</i></font> <br><br>This is something that I just don't understand. I play casually. If it takes two hours to do something for the player with a lot of time, it still takes two hours for the casual player to do. The only difference there is that the casual player (or whatever you want to call a player without a lot of time to play each week) needs more real-life hours to pass before he or she gets the same task done as others that play more. Honestly, a casual player should know that this is pretty much normal. Heck, I've got a really cool model sitting on a bookcase in my bedroom that only needs a few more hours work to finish. But it's going to take me months to get it done. That's ok with me, because I know that I have little time to dedicate to it. The fact that someone else might have completed it over a weekend has no bearing on it. <br><br>Yes, there are some times when the time lost because of short game sessions (like looking for groups) is really lost time. But travel time isn't one of those times. It's time you need to spend regardless of how many sessions it takes you to get it done. I guess that's part of the reason why I think of it as a convenience than a need. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is that clearer?]</i></font> <br><br>Yes it is. Do I agree that this is a good idea? I don't know. I'll think on it some more. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Alan, if the only good thing to come from this conversation is that this idea is given serious consideration, then the post was worth the effort.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, you've certainly gotten me to think about it. I've also passed a link to this thread to the Live Team&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Second, can you check into the Onyx Encrusted Urn thing? I'd *love* to burn the 100 plat I earned last night experimenting further.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry. It's been such a long time since I responded to this thread, I have no idea what that was all about&#8230; <br><br>Howsabout this. I imagine you have a list of stuff that you want fixed for trade skills. Send them to me and I'll pass them on. Underline the Urn. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The point I was trying to make was this: one of the reasons you have such an outcry over nerfs -- even one as justified as this -- is that VERANT created an environment in which the PLAYERS developed an us-versus-them mentality.]</i></font> <br><br>And, well, I'm not sure how that happened or how that could have been prevented. <br><br>Obviously one of the goals of a game like this is to get people involved and attached. We want enthusiasm from players and developers alike. Unfortunately a side affect of making a good game is that you have to keep it good. Being willing to make changes is important. And when those changes affect something personal, something that the player is enthusiastic about, like his character, the players react. That's a good thing, really. Without it, the game isn't compelling and nobody is here talking about it. <br><br>Obviously we don't want to develop any sort of us-versus-them mentality. It makes things muddy. It is very hard to get points across to people that feel that we are out to get them. And, by the same token, it's hard to understand the points that people are trying to make amidst finger pointing and anger. <br><br>So, sure, maybe it is our fault that people feel so strongly about the game and their characters, we want that. And, yes, we feel strongly about the game itself (if only you could hear a hotly-debated tuning meeting&#8230;). But there is no need for any adversarial relationship between players and developers. At times, though, we are going to make changes that will upset people. And people will say things that upset us (or me, I can't really talk for the whole company on that point). The real trick is to understand that we are all passionate about how this turns out. <br><br>Heh, lots of words but no resolution&#8230; I don't have one. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: That is, it is my opinion that the fact your clients have been treated as victims in the game contributed to the way those same clients react to "metagame" changes.]</i></font> <br><br>That might be true, I don't know. I've never been a part of a GM quest myself. But, well, those sorts of quests are long in the past now. I would hope that changing for the better would count for something. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does that sound better?]</i></font> <br><br>I understand what you are saying. I've done exactly that, but in reverse. Went to a game at a friends house (a long story, but we play with them semi-annually instead of going to conventions &#8211; when we went to conventions we pretty much only played with these folks anyhow&#8230;) and when it was over I just erased items that I had gained off of my character sheet (I kept one). Their world was too rich in items compared to ours. <br><br>I guess the point here is that, and I think you hit on this, the 'loss' in the 'victim' scenario EverQuest is at most going to be some experience points and some time. If I play the victim in my regular campaign, I'm going to genuinely lose. For example, we once had to 'bribe' our way out of Baba Yaga's hut. That was a mess. I was playing my greediest character, therefore he had the most stuff to offer. He was practically itemless when it was over. And this was a 'victim' situation, the Witch would have destroyed us. That was a far greater loss for that character (and, therefore, for me) than a level in EverQuest would be. <br><br>And yet, that was a very fun game for all of us. Five years later my character still complains about it, and he still hasn't recovered much of his stuff. <br><br>But, yes, I agree that to expect a random EverQuest player to play like I do is probably not reasonable. And I still want to stress that this sort of thing just doesn't happen anymore. <br><br>Alpheus-SoL wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Fighting Strahd Von Zarovich, Alan? ]</i></font> <br><br>Him too&#8230; <br><br>But the instance I was thinking of was a trap. Crying child turns out to be a vampire child. Once close enough, charm and that's it. It nailed me and turned my character into a vampire. I had no chance, really. Then, though, the fun began. As the 'victim' in this case, I got to hunt down and kill the rest of the party because I knew that they would tell people that I had become a vampire and I'd have to run from them the rest of my life. <br><br>I'm not sure if I was the victim or if the party was. Be we all lost that day. <br><br>Grimstaff wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Alpheus, nobody likes being the victim. Volunteering to be a victim in a game or play is one thing, but being one because you zoned in and A_GM_God_Creature01 butchers you is not fun.]</i></font> <br><br>But that's really my point. By signing on to play in a roleplaying game you need to accept that the world goes on around you, and getting caught in the wrong place at the wrong time can happen. In a way, that's part of what makes the setting real.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069356.html"><b>PvP Talk</b></a><br>Hi all. <br><br>As with the class talk threads, I'll be certain to get you any information as soon as we've made some decisions.

From Mennix:<BLOCKQUOTE>As I'm sure most of you already know, EverQuest celebrated its two year<br>anniversary on March 16. To mark this occasion, various teams associated<br>with EverQuest dug deep into their archives and came up with a few things to<br>share with the EverQuest community. What did they find? Well first, they<br>came up with some alpha screenshots. Ever see a Dark Elf with a Mohawk? If<br>not, then you must check out the screenshots. We were also able to obtain a<br>very early EverQuest client from Brad McQuaid himself. This is a must-see<br>along with a pre-alpha movie.<br><br>The SOE Art Department did their share also. We recently got the appropriate<br>equipment to create our own movies and the art department has been giggling<br>like school girls ever since. Their first creation was a EQ 2nd Anniversary<br>movie that is now available for download at the EverQuest site. And now<br>completely mad with power and overflowing with ego, the art department has<br>also created the first EverQuest screensaver which will be available for<br>download soon.<br><br>Yet, that is not it. EverQuest concept art is also available along with 12<br>scans of early Keith Parkinson sketches. <br><br>Check out the EverQuest 2nd Anniversary site and help us celebrate a<br>remarkable two years of gaming.<br><br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp">EQ 2n Anniversary</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Mennix!
