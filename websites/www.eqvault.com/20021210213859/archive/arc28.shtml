From Cebu:<BLOCKQUOTE> I just wanted to let you guys know about a site that my friends and I have put up recently. Currently, the focus of the site revolves around a Java application that we have written for EQ. It is called GroupMaker. As the name suggests, the program is used for organizing groups for planes and dragons. Right now it is still in its infant stages, but soon we hope to have such features as autogrouping (automatically groups everyone listed for your raid based on a raid template), macro support, and the ability to keep up with the status of the groups during the raid (this would require using a second machine on your network). I am pretty excited about this program, and I hope people recognize the time - saving potential that it has. The site is <a href="http://www.llamaherder.com">http://www.llamaherder.com</a> . <br> <br>Thanks for your time,<br>Cebu</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Alan visited the Developer's Corner and added several new updates to it today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000281.html"><b>Resistance Bug on Sullon Zek</b></a><br>Yup, there is indeed a bug with the way the changes to PvP resistances on Sullon Zek are working right now. We've narrowed the problem down and hope to have it fixed early next week. <br><br>Thanks to those that sent us detailed examples of the problem.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000280.html"><b>Ogre and Troll Guards in Neriak</b></a><br>Anonymous wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Something that really cheapens EverQuest for me is seeing players hunting "safe" camps in cities. Ogguk before the wolf form changes for example. It really removes the role playing feel when you can fight in the middle of a town and no one notices. It's not that I object to raiding cities, it's the risk free camps in cities. <br><br>The latest is the Troll and Ogre guards in Neriak. Apparently the faction hit isn't anything to worry about (maybe there isn't one, maybe a little red wine fixes it), and the DE guards won't assist them. As a result people are constantly killing Trolls and Ogres right in front of the DE guards. <br><br>I can't imagine a city where the guards would allow this to happen, but then I can't imagine a player who'd thing this was fun. <br><br>If you do decide to respond to this could make me anonymous, I'm sure there are those who would blame me for "ruining" the game. ]</i></font><br><br>I can imagine it pretty easily&#8230; <br><br>Guard Bl' Amo says: Hey, look over there. Another one of those ridiculous Ogre guards is taking a beating. <br><br>Guard Sm' Asho laughs. <br><br>Guard Sm' Asho says: That's pretty funny. But it does upset me just a bit. <br><br>Guard Bl' Amo says: Why is that? <br><br>Guard Sm' Asho says: I was thinking of killing that one myself. He's been a little uppity lately, thinking that he actually has some sort of <i>right</i> to be here. <br><br>Dark Elves don't much like Ogres or Trolls. They tolerate them because they have been ordered to do so, not because they think they make good company. <br><br>And calling it 'safe' is a bit off. The Ogre guards aren't exactly pushovers.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000277.html"><b>Invoke Death</b></a><br>I was just about to make this response: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: absor that isn't true, the 55 hitting pet is now coning even to a 39 and it used to be lvl 41. <br><br>please look into it. <br><br>Abillister "Monkey" Abu ]</i></font><br><br>All of my data tells me that this pet always has maxed out at 39th level. <br><br>I'll keep looking into this, however. <br><br>Alan <br><br>But as I was about to post it, we discovered what had happened. It's kind of hard to explain, but we'll try. <br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>All the Pet NPCs are named a certain way which reflects their level. Last week I was cataloguing the sats of the pets in game and I guess I accidentally edited the wrong NPC, when I went to set it back I set it's level to the level indicated in it's name. At some point in the past the level of the 49 necro pet was changed to be higher than the one listed in its name. This caused the max level of the pet as well as its average level to be lowered by 2. I have corrected the mistake I made in the pet's level, and we will be updating this on the servers this afternoon. The update will not require the servers to come down. I'm really sorry for this mistake, and hope I haven't inconvenienced anyone too much. Thanks to everyone who reported my error so quickly. <br><br>Take care <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Let me give a fake example. I'm oversimplifying this to help make it clear. <br><br>Let's say there was a pet named Bob4. That name would indicate that he was of the type Bob and is intended to be level 4. <br><br>At some point in the past it was decided that Bob needed to be 6th level. Because the name Bob4 is referenced in a lot of other places in the game, changing the name might not be the best idea, so someone just raised Bob4 to level 6. <br><br>When Lawrence noticed the error he'd made by accidentally editing Bob4, he went back to make Bob4 4th level, as his name indicated. <br><br>From looking at the data there wasn't an easy way to know that Bob4 should have been 6th level. <br><br>But when we delved into it and tapped into Gordon's impressive database talent we were able to look and see that prior to Lawrence's revision, Bob4 had indeed been 6th level. <br><br>Again, we're sorry for the error. And thanks for pointing it out.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000278.html"><b>Sullon Zek</b></a><br>SnowShadower wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm still looking (so I may have missed it) but to have a place where ALL Sullon Zek rules are posted would be a good thing.

Things picked up for a change on the Developer's Corner today.  Here's the latest from Alan VanCouvering:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000276.html"><b>Faction Cap Messages</b></a><br>At this time faction cap messages are broken. Players that are at their cap (either low or high) are not getting a message telling them that their faction cannot be raised/lowered. The caps are still in place and everything is working as normal. No caps were changed. It's just the messages that are broken. <br><br>We should have this fixed with the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000275.html"><b>Problems Logging In</b></a><br>If you're having a problem logging in and the system is telling you that your Game Card does not exist, there's a way around the problem. <br><br>Find the testeverquest.exe file in your EverQuest directory and run that. After the Test patcher downloads files to you, click cancel (you don't need to actually log onto the Test server, just download the files). Then log into the game as you normally would (you'll probably end up downloading a few more files). <br><br>This should let you in the game again. <br><br>We're sorry for the inconvenience.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000274.html"><b>Lending a Helping Hand</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hey all, <br><br>I want to share with you an EQ experience I had last night. <br><br>I was in Rivervale making hundreds of heady kiolas, in prepration for some tailoring work, when a "can you help me please?" appears in my chat box. My first thought, of course, was that the person wanted a port (im a druid) - I am normally more than happy to port people, but I was well into making heady kiola's and really didn't want to break my rythym (I needed 320 of the damn things :)) - if you have ever done much trade skill stuff, you will know what I mean. My usual good nature won out though (heh :)), so I turned around, ready to do a port. <br><br>Standing in front of me was a naked level 1 halfling warrior. My next thought, of course, was "damn beggars". I didn't say that though, and asked this person what I could do for him. <br><br>"Where do I go to kill things?", he asked. I was a bit shocked, I'll admit - it's not the sort of question I get asked alot these days. <br><br>"Misty Thicket is where you should be hunting, as a level 1 halfling", I replied. <br><br>"How do I get there? And are there dragons there?" <br><br>After explaining to him that no, there were in fact no dragons in Misty Thicket ("says dragons on the box") and SoWed him and said "Follow me, friend". When we got to the Misty Thicket zone, he mentions "I just bought the game." Instantly, I go into massive help mode - I have a huge soft spot for true "newbies" to Everquest (not your beggar types, but your real, "hey-what's-this-game" type newbies). True to form for most computer game players (myself included :)), he hadn't read the manual, so over the next 2 hours or so, I explained to him the very basics of the game (how to attack, how to set up hotkeys, /loc, how to get his newbie tunic, how to train skills, etc, etc) and then took him out to Misty Thicket, threw a few buffs on him (no damage shield though :)), and helped him get to level 2. He may have only been killing what most of us regard as newbie "yard-trash", but he was *loving* it. <br><br>"I'm the man! I'm the bat, wolf, rat and bixie killing man!" he declared at one point :). <br><br>As I helped him, and answered his questions, it occurred to me, for the first time in a very long time, that EverQuest is a bloody hard game to get started in. <br><br>I have been playing for almost two years now, and have spent 18 months playing Sorran and over that time have learnt so much about the game, that I almost take that knowledge for granted. Answering this newbie's questions really slammed home how *vast* this world of Norrath is. I took pause and sent a silent /salute to Verant for this extraordinary creation. Many of us may question many of their decisions, but the fact remains, regardless of your specific complaints or concerns, there exists a truly magical world at the heart of it all. It is breath-taking in its scope and granduer - once in a while, take the time out from your xp camps or raids to "smell the roses". I got a chance to look at Norrath through the eyes of a newbie last night, and it blew me away all over again. <br><br>Most of us can never again experience that true moment of newbie-wonder, not even in another game. We know too much about MMORPGs work now - no matter the game, we expect there to be a "newbie" period, we know there will be "spolier" sites to get info from, we know there will be certain classes/skills/items that will be better than others, we expect hackers/cheaters/scammers, and so on. The creatures, the game mechanics, the environment may all be totally different from game to game but, at their core, they are all the same - they are all MMORPGs. For those of us already playing them, we can never again be a true newbie. <br><br>For me, Everquest is my first MMORPG - I clearly remember my wonder as I ventured beyond North Qeynos for the first time and into the Hills of Qeynos - I was awestruck at this *huge* zone (hah! :)), amazed at the sunsets behind the hills, terrified of following the road deeper into the Hills. I can still appreciate the visual splendour of the world of Norrath, but I am far more jaded player than I was 2 years ago. <br><br>I am a level 60 druid, wearing nice gear, proudly wielding my epic weapon, and lucky enough to be in a great guild that is currently exploring the "end-game" of Everquest as it stands at the moment (North wing of the Temple of veeshan, Sleeper's Tomb). I have a lot of fun, and get to fight some pretty nasty creatures. But you know what? For two hours last night, I envied that level 1 halfing warrior, taking his very first steps into Norrath. I mourned for the loss of my MMORPG "innocence". <br><br>So again, /salute to Verant for letting us all into Norrath (and /bonk for the silly decisions of course :)). <br><br>And /salute to that halfing warrior who let me share in his first steps into Norrath - you may have thanked me for my help, but I am far more indebted to you than you can imagine. <br><br>Cheers, <br><br>Sorran<br>Heirophant of the Vagrants<br>Tribunal Server<br>World of Norrath. <br><br>P.S. Maybe other's could send in their "newbie-wonder" moments here? :)]</i></font><br><br>Nicely done. <br><br>I remember a few moments like that. There's a certain awe in being there when someone gets to experience things for the first time. It's always a blast to help out a truly new player. I encourage you all to give it a try. :)<br><br>Rather than starting up a thread here about "newbie-wonder" moments, how about doing in on the Newbie Zone? I think this would be a good topic for that board. <br><br>I posted it here mostly because you reminded me that some of the best times I've had in game were showing people how to play. And it's nice to post a bit of a sappy story some times. :)<br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000273.html"><b>Retaining Characters</b></a><br>Paulaner-Weizen wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: How long will my account and characters be kept after canceling my account? I've been playing over two years and would like to take a break. I'd hate to lose all my characters though. <br><br>Thanks ]</i></font><br><br>Officially we only promise to keep characters for three months on an inactive account. <br><br>However, we have yet to actually delete any characters from inactive accounts, with the exception of a few first level character purges that we've done recently.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000271.html"><b>Fippy's Facts</b></a><br>xmorg wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Id just like to say bright idea on the fippy's facts! Not only do i feel for fippy's cause I have always wondered about the "Diety" or who worships who.<br>Other things id like to see fippy find out are the class ratio on servers, date Trak, Vox Inny was first brought down, maybe even by who... just interesting little nuggets about the games history. Good Job!]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, Fippy came up with the idea himself. <br><br>Some facts might be beyond his ability to come up with (such as the first date Vox was killed), but not many. There will also be some facts that we really don&#8217;t want to publish (like how many times Fippy has been killed on each server&#8230;). <br><br>But Fippy has a lot of facts stored in his head. We'll shake a few out for you every week.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000272.html"><b>Pet Spell Casting Bug</b></a><br>It seems that there is a bug with pets that would normally cast spells. Right now, they don't. <br><br>We're aware of the issue and we're looking into it. I'll let you know more when I know more.<br>----<br>:)<br><br>Well, seems that we've already fixed it! <br><br>Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for your patience.</UL>

A new installment of <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000269.html">Ask Brad</a> was published on the Developer's Corner:<UL><b>Ask Brad -- 8/14/01 </b><br><br>---- <br><br>Why are quests in EQ taking more and more people to complete? It seems to me that this game has gone overboard with making content for the 50+ people in very large guilds. <br><br>It now takes more then one full group to complete a guest for any item with ok stats, and in many cases it takes 3 to 4 full groups to get items for quests. Why? Only 10 to 15% of the people who play EverQuest will be able to get any of the better quest items and I am not talking about the UBER items. <br><br>I hope to see when SoL comes out that quest can be done with just one person, or at the max of one full group. <br><br>-Gindain <br><br>P.S. I love the new screen shots of SoL. More, More! :)<br><br><b>Luclin is indeed being designed moreso for one or two groups of players and focused overall less on raids. It will also provide content for all levels, 1-60. <br><br>I do think, however, that Velious&#8217; attention to raids and other epic battles was and is important. While it is true that not everyone will reach 60 or have the time to involve themselves in large guilds, the playerbase as a whole still enjoys that content vicariously. MMORPGs need rumors and legends of awesome, virtually unbeatable foes against which mortals send armies. Just looking around at various message boards you can find all sorts of players debating the high-end of the game. In fact, when we sometimes change aspects of the high level game we get all sorts of feedback, both negative and positive, from players who aren&#8217;t even close to experiencing the content we changed. Why? Because it&#8217;s a goal for them &#8211; they plan on encountering that content one day, no matter how far in the future. <br><br>I remember playing a certain MUD several years ago and being low level and in a newbie dungeon. I overheard some mid level players talking about another group who&#8217;d allegedly fought a dragon. Immediately I approached them and asked them if there were really dragons in the game, and if so why haven&#8217;t I seen any? Where were they, I inquired, and what were they like? <br><br>Well, not only did they have no clue how to get to where dragons were, they also let me know that it would take months and months of hard work before I&#8217;d even have a chance to encounter a dragon. That was an important day for me. It was at that moment I knew the MUD was for me &#8211; a game that had legends and rumors and where experiencing the &#8216;end-game&#8217; was something to really strive for. <br><br>So while I know we&#8217;ve been criticized for paying too much attention to &#8216;uber guilds&#8217; and their needs and wants, I do think there needs to be a balance. There should be content at the high end for single groups, massive raids, and everything in between. And to that end, Shadows of Luclin should complement the Scars of Velious quite well. <br><br>Ps. More SoL screenshots are on there way &#8211; hang in there :)</b><br><br>----- <br><br>Brad, <br><br>When SW:G comes out, some EQ players will switch over and play it full time. Others, like myself, will purchase it and play both. You might get more people to continue to play, and pay, for both if you give a monthly fee discount if a player has both accounts active. Maybe make the EQ fee $5 for players also paying for SW:G. Any chance of this happening? <br><br>Tennaj<br>Cleric of Farstorm <br><br><b>While it&#8217;s certainly far too early to announcing pricing plans, we are definitely thinking about how it might work with the suite of titles we&#8217;re planning on having one day. I think there probably will be many players who might be interested in multiple premium titles, and I think we should have pricing that is attractive to them. I think its both in our interest and the players out there that they are each able to experience EverQuest, SW:G, Planetside, and Sovereign and decide which, if not all, they are interested in playing. </b><br><br>----- <br><br>Hi. <br><br>I have been playing EQ for about a year now, and I love it. I just have one question (well, only one I'm going to ask now *smile*): Are there any plans to make any additional new races and/or classes? (After the upcoming Vah Shir and Beastlord additions) I was asking simply because I would LOVE to play a dragon-derived race...like a half human/half dragon. I guess similar to Iksar, but based on Dragon rather than Lizard descent. Because they were humanoid rather than full dragon, there wouldn't be any issues with unfair advantages over other races. This race would be good as a Shaman, Enchanter (dragons and gems/gold *grin*), probably Warrior...although they would probably lean more toward magic type classes. Perhaps even a class similar to a Mage with dragon-specific pets? I'm still playing around with the possibilities, but I'm sure you all would think of something :)</b><br>Thanks for your time. <br><br>-Worddeity <br><br><b>That&#8217;s a neat idea and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t rule out the possibility of future new races and classes. But, honestly, I doubt one would be too lizard-like (or dragon-like) in that we already have the Iksar. We&#8217;d probably be more inclined to introduce a race significantly different from any other existing race in order to make the game more interesting. </b><br><br>----- <br><br>1) Will there be locks to pick on Luclin? <br><br><b>Yes. </b><br><br>2) Will there be traps to disarm? <br><br><b>Absolutely. </b><br><br>3) Will there be poison drops? <br><br><b>Probably. </b><br><br>4) Will #2 and #3 be in zones below 45th level? <br><br><b>Some might be, yes. </b><br><br>- SirReal <br><br>----- <br><br>Brad - What has the development team done different in SoL for low and mid level zones that will entice them to be used. Currently if you go to Paw, Permafrost, Sol A, Ct, Dalnir, Nurga and a few others there are always less then group in the dungeon. Then you go to a zone like Lake of Ill Omen or Oasis and there are 80 people in each fighting over spawns. <br><br><b>I think it&#8217;s related to risk vs. reward. Mid level dungeons, especially on older servers where higher-end items have trickled down, just don&#8217;t have treasure that&#8217;s appealing enough to lure players into a more risky area. One of our hopes with the Trivial Loot Code is to be able to put better items in mid-level dungeons in order to entice mid-level players back into them. </b><br><br>The reason I ask this is that as a high level player (60) I would love to have access to some high level dungeons that are only explored by one group at a time. This doesn't seem to happen because all the post 50 players are pretty much crowded into 3 or 4 zones. I guess what I'm asking is why do you continue to develop new mid level zones when a large majority of the current mid level zones never get used, while at the same time high levels are forced to fight in zones with 80 plus people. <br><br>Nylak <br><br><b>In addition to making sure there are several high-level dungeons on Luclin, we also plan on converting some of the existing and underused older dungeons to high-level zones. We realize that it&#8217;s not just treasure, but also distance that can frustrate low and mid-level players and that some zones are just too far away. Around the time of Luclin&#8217;s release or soon after, several of these zones will be changed such that higher-level players are their target audience. </b><br><br>----- <br><br>Heyas Brad. A few quick questions here: <br><br>First off, at the bottom of The Hole, there is a locked door that I heard leads to Brells Plane and at the bottom of Lake of Ill Omen there is a zone which leads to Veksar. I am just wondering if these have intentions of being implemented in the near future or at all? <br><br><b>I sure hope so. Veksar is supposed to be completely underwater, similar to Kedge Keep, and I think the game could definitely use another zone like that. As for entries to other planes, we&#8217;d also like to see more of those in the future. The nice thing about Norrath is that we have a LOT of room to expand. I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to it and hope you all are, as well. </b><br><br><br>I have also noticed that on some items (e.g. cloth) that the race VAH is listed on the item tag, also as a LARGE race. Are other items going to take on this same effect for changing the race and do you have any plans to fix the item tag for other races / classes for example Iksars (eg. Cobalt?) and items involving the Beastmaster class? <br><br><b>Yes, many items will be changed such that the Vah Shir can wear/wield them. But certainly not all items, nor are items that are usable by the Vah Shir necessarily supposed to be usable by the Iksar, or vice versa. We think it&#8217;s more interesting to have some items race restricted. </b><br><br>One last thing, In Development needs to be more update to date after all it's what is in development right? I haven't heard much on the revamping of Vox's lair 8) <br><br>Thanks. <br><br>-Wolffeet <br><br><b>Agreed, and I&#8217;m not sure what to say there. We never seem to update that page often enough, although I think we have improved a bit. Honestly, we just get so focused on actually implementing new content and features that we sometimes forget to announce that which we can. </b><br><br>----- <br><br>Mr. McQuaid, <br><br>Can you give us any more information on the "Umbra" engine you mentioned in your last ASK BRAD column? Who designed it, what video devices it works with, a website we can look at etc? <br><br>Thanks!<br>Paladin5000 <br><br><b>Check out <a href="http://www.surrender3d.com/umbra/index.html">http://www.surrender3d.com/umbra/index.html</a>. </b><br><br>----- <br><br>Hail, and well met! <br><br>Just wanted to drop Brad a line saying THANK YOU! for his "Ask Brad" columns. It's great reading and I'm sure it takes a hefty chunk of time to read through the (no doubt) huge number of submissions, pick good ones worthy of an answer (and Brad's mood, and the phase on the moon), research the answer (if necessary), and typing out those nice detailed responses. <br><br>So, Thank you, Brad! <br><br>[I hope this "comment" makes it to him!] <br><br>Semjaza Angelhealer<br>49th Dwarven Cleric of Erollsi Marr<br>Follower of Brell Serilis<br>Guild Leader of Dragons of Hope <br><br><b>Thanks Semjaza and others who&#8217;ve sent similar emails &#8211; writing Ask Brad is a lot of fun, but it&#8217;s also very nice to know that players enjoy reading it and hopefully find it informative. </b><br><br>----- <br><br>Brad, <br><br>You keep saying you encourage grouping, and place a lot of importance on social interaction. When are you going to add a mechanism so that members of multiple groups can communicate with each other, other than using /ooc or /shout? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Gorit <br><br><b>Soon, we promise :)  It&#8217;s probably one of the highest priority features other than getting Luclin done. And what that really means is it should be patched probably around the time Luclin comes out or fairly soon after. It&#8217;s not a monumental task, but nor is it quickly implemented, so we need some time. </b><br><br>----- <br><br>Almost everyone in the game knows that Qeynos is Sonyeq backwards. My question is first, whose idea was this, and second, are there any other names like this that have eluded us thus far? I have always personally thought that "feerott" (to reef backwards) expressed your desire to retire to some sunny tropical reef following the phenomenal success of EQ. ;-) <br><br><b>Wow, if I recall correctly, I think it was mostly Steve Clover&#8217;s idea. He and I named the continents and the starting cities pretty early on, and then Bill Trost and Kevin Burns came on board and began to fill in the rest of the detail. It was also, by the way, Steve Clover who originally named the game &#8216;EverQuest&#8217;. And I think Qeynos was originally called Keynos, but Bill later convinced us to change the K into a Q &#8211; I guess to be less cryptic. <br><br>As for other &#8216;Easter eggs&#8217;, as they are often called, I recently ran across the following site: <a href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/easterquest.htm">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/easterquest.htm</a>. It claims to have uncovered all sorts of hidden meanings and word arrangements in the game&#8230; that said, I certainly can&#8217;t vouch as to whether any of it&#8217;s really true or merely coincidence :)</b><br><br>In regards to the person who pointed out the negative connotation to the abbreviation for the Shadows of Luclin, I have to say that I saw it as a rather clever pun at first. Sol being the name for our sun, I thought it was a bit of irony to give a lunar expansion the name of a sun. Did you realize this when you came up with the name? <br><br>Marcyn <br><br><b>No, I think we were too busy debating and worried about the other connotation to get that creative :)</b><br><br>----- <br><br>Are you ready to let us know if you're going to be redoing the Iksar look? I know when Kunark came out Iksars had some added detail that other races did not at the time. I could come up reasons to and not to. However please let me know! <br><br>-Rivendark <br><br><b>Yes, we are redoing all the races, including the Iksar. You are correct that the current Iksar model has more detail and polygons than the original races, but it&#8217;s still not at the level we&#8217;re shooting for in Luclin. </b><br><br>----- <br><br>When SoL comes out, will it JUST be the expansion? Or will I be able to buy a package pack of EQ+Sol? Or a gigantic pac of EQ+Kunark+Velious+Sol? <br><br>-B_O_B <br><br><b>Luclin will be released on its own, the same way Velious was. So you&#8217;ll need the original game in order to run it. Currently Velious is in stores along with Kunark, which has both the original game as well as Kunark. And then there&#8217;s the smaller, old world only, EverQuest box. <br><br>By the time Luclin comes out most Velious and Kunark boxes will have been sold and you&#8217;ll see the EverQuest Trilogy box instead (which will include the old world, Kunark, and Velious). <br><br>In other words, there will be three total SKUs: <br><br>1. EverQuest Trilogy (EQ+Kunark+Velious)<br>2. The Shadows of Luclin (Luclin only)<br>3. EverQuest mini-box (EQ only) </b><br><br>----- <br><br>Hi Brad, <br><br>I recently quit EQ due to personal reasons (unrelated to EQ). The last two years, Norrath was my home and I enjoyed every moment of it. I will carry the magic of EverQuest with me for the rest of my life. I thank you for that!! <br><br>Anyways, I was just curious as to how you personally looked at d00d speak...when people ask " SoW me plz dr00d" etc. It used to drive me nuts. How do you feel about it? :)<br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Beeshma/ Duryodhan <br><br><b>Hrm. That&#8217;s a tough one, because the &#8216;speak&#8217; you describe can vary so much and is subjective. I definitely prefer that players remain in-character when saying and shouting, but /ooc is another situation altogether. Personally, I&#8217;m not a big fan of alternating capital letters and replacing letters with numbers, but I do use abbreviations like afk, btw, brt, rofl, lol, etc., because it saves having to type so many letters. </b><br><br>----- <br><br>If Norrath isn't flat, why can't I take a boat from Odus to Faydwer :)<br><br>- Iillil_MT <br><br><b>Because! :)</b><br><br>----- <br><br>Quite a while ago, I remember seeing a poll on Everquest.com that asked "What NPC would you most like to play?" or something similar. And I believe that Kerrans won, then earlier this year Luclin was announced and the new playable race was the Vah Shir (Kerran Ancestors). So my question is at the time of this poll, how much of Luclin was thought out and if, lets say fairies had won the poll, would we be seeing a fairy city up there? (Which was my vote by the way) :P <br><br>-Finnel_Test <br><br><b>We started planning Luclin maybe a month before Velious was launched, but didn&#8217;t start seriously working on it until January of this year. The polls we did definitely heavily influenced which playable race we decided would start on Luclin, as did how easily existing history meshed in with the idea. Fairies were also very popular, as were Frogloks, but it made less sense for them to be on the moon (hey, who can argue with the concept of &#8216;cats in space&#8217;? j/k). </b><br><br>----- <br><br>Does the team (either development or otherwise) check out some of the major fights for the first couple times it happens? <br><br>I picture something like taking down some of the ultra tough mobs as something like " Morpheus is fightin' Neo!" <br><br>Do you hear stuff like "[Guild name here] is taking the Sleeper!" or is it more of reading about it from logs and such? Or maybe you're too busy developing Luclin for that type of deterrent from everyday work? :+) <br><br>Thanks for the column, by the way. Great stuff. <br><br>Chaotic Conformity <br><br><b>Even though we are busy, we still try to watch players, especially the first time they&#8217;ve entered a new area. GMs are usually dispatched to watch and take notes, and often the game designers in charge of that area watch as well. And contrary to some unfortunate assertions out there that we don&#8217;t like to see our zones &#8216;beat&#8217;, the opposite is actually true. The game designers love to see their content interacted with and often stay up late after a long day of work to watch players play. <br><br>----- <br><br>That&#8217;s it for now &#8211; thanks again for all the emails! <br><br>-Brad </b></UL>

I received a new report from Alvaron Silverleaf:<BLOCKQUOTE>Today the oddest thing happened. A Chef Gokke, an ogre hailing from Neriak apparantly, sought out people in the Western Commonlands to retrieve the heads of his lost dinner, three little rats.  Being a ranger myself, I sought out these rats not necessarily to help the ogre, but to protect the people of Freeport from getting nipped by the beasts and catching some disease. I ended up finding them racing around the entrance of Freeport, along with 15 other people trying to kill them.  Apparantly, Gokke might have slipped something in their water since they were racing around and jumping all over the place, evading the blades of any who tried to hit them.  Spells didn't even seem to work upon them!  Me being of only my 10th rank, realize I am not the best at either magic or swordmanship.  So, being the resourceful ranger that I am, I take out my bow, say a quick prayer to Tunare, pull out an arrow, aim and shoot.  A hit!  Making more hits than misses, I finally fell the beast.  About to shout my victory, a scoundrel of a wizard runs up and takes the head of the rodent before I can!  Needless to say I was furious, but realizing there where still two more rats, I began the chase once again.  This time, others had been able to hit the rat so it was already a little weak, but weaker still after I unleashed many more arrows into it's hide.  Victory again, though this time I grab the head before anyone else and safely stash it in my pouch.<br> <br>Then I raced to Neriak as swiftly as I can, avoiding the grasp of the dreaded dragoons patrolling the forest.  Upon my entering, I find the Chef with a few other people, one of whom had another of the three heads.  I walked slowly up to the brute and handed him the rat head.  He smiled a big toothy grin and handed me a nice reward of 100 gold.  As I was about to walk away, he stops me and says he has one more thing.  So I stop and he goes a little table and takes out an obviously moldy loaf of bread, cuts two slices and slaps the rat head between them.  I thought it was for him.  I was wrong.  He comes back to me, and hands me the sandwich with the whiskers peeking out the side. Now I have seen many a battle and in war, one sees many an unpleasant thing, but never have I ever smelt or seen anything as nausiating as that sandwich and I know only Tunare kept me from becoming violently ill at that moment.  So taking the sandwich as carefully as I can, along with holding my nose, I put it into my pouch. Perhaps some dogs will find it appeatising.  I go over to a nearby corner and rest a moment after my long run from Freeport to here.  As I waited, Chef Gokke started getting impatient about the last head and said he was really starting to get hungry for his dinner.  Of course, some Teir'dal began showing up at the time also and heard Gokke's laments. One casually told him to eat me, or at least take my head and eat that.  Needless to say, with a now drooling ogre and a circle of cackling and grinning dark elves beginning to form around me, I grabbed my gear and raced out of their as quick as I could, practically running right into the dragoons.  Thankfully, they were too startled to see a Feir'dal running from their own city to react quick enough and before they knew it, I was gone.<br> <br>Well, I can assure you, that will be the last time I aid an ogre, Tunare forgive me.  Hopefully next time, my adventuring will keep me well away from any half-starved, half-ton, foul smelling brutes seeking aid.<br> <br><I>"From the journals of Alvaron Silverleaf, <br>Waywatcher of the Fay and loyal ranger of Tunare ..."<br> <br>/ooc</i><br> <br>This was just a great little event on the Tribunal that didn't have anything to do with the major events of Norrath.  Just something fun to do for once.  I think the best part was watching all these high level people trying to run down these little rats and not really being able to harm them.  Even more funny was that people thought I was part of the event since I was really the only one hitting them ;)  All and all, after I got my 100gp and rat sandwich, I stuck around alittle bit and me and the GM Chef Gokke played around, resulting in me getting another 50pp for my roleplaying with him.  May not be much to a lot of you people, but to an untwinked lvl 10 ranger it was a lot ;)  The dark elves really did want him to eat me too!  But luckily I talked him out of it.  Just thought I'd post my story for those people who think they never will be part of a GM event. Trust me, it will happen one day.  See you all around, farewell!<br> <br>Alvaron Silverleaf<br>The Tribunal</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the news!

I'm back home after a nice vacation after a long drive.   It went well other than some weird traffic problems in Denver involving about 2 tons of cow guts.  Don't ask. :)  Anyway, I'm getting caught up with email and that stuff so hopefully I'll be back in the swing of things shortly.<br><br>I'd like to thank ChrisLTD for covering the news and the "Daily" sections while I was gone.  I'm afraid IGN wasn't able to get him on the <a href="mailto:eqnews@vaultnetwork.com">eqnews@vaultnetwork.com</a> alias so there was a lack of in-game news, mainly event announcements and reports.  If anything wasn't posted that was sent to that list (the eqnews address <i>is</I> now work fine now though) <b><a href="mailto:aurum@vaultnetwork.com">please email me personally</a></b> and I'll see to it that it gets up asap.  <br><br>One more note, I apologize for the lack of Artwork over the last week.  I had meant to get some to ChrisLTD to be posted while I was gone but I came down with a violent fever the day before I left and couldn't do much of anything.<br><br>Rest assured that I'll have some new art up by the end of today.<br><br>Thanks!

Exarr sent in this report:<BLOCKQUOTE>Late this past night, 3 wolves appeared mysteriously in the Greater Faydark bearing the names of Hairsplitter, Tailchaser, and Boneburier.  Strangely they did not respond to Hails, nor did they regard any mention of the Mother of All, Tunare.  They appeared to be of mid difficulty, and were protected by the gods, much to the dismay of the many more experienced beings who venture to the Faydark. Details are sketchy at best, but the wolves continued to roam, attacking younger players as the progressed from the Southern Lift to the Priest of Discord Lift, to the nothern most Orc lift, and I myself encountered Hairsplitter at the tunnel to Crushbone. He proved too much a match for me, attacking fast for minimal damage, and without my group I was had to loose him in the tunnel to escape. No word on what happened afterwards...<br> <br>/ooc The wolves were allied with the Kelethin guards, so anyone who attacked them ran the risk of getting agroed. They didnt respond to hail, or anything in particular, and attacked at random. Some people were upset with this and many just left the zone, I dont know what else happened, but it was kind of discouraging with just mindless hack and slash, maybe someone figured something out later.<br> <br>-Exarr [Knecht du Insomnia]<br>Rogue on Rodcet Nife</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Alan on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000265.html" target="_blank">Developer's Corner Forum</a>:<br><blockquote><blockquote>In the case of the abuse of safe zones, it is well known that using such locations is against our rules. It can't be reasonably argued that any player with a character over 50th level doesn't understand that.<br></blockquote><br><br><b>Since I'm approaching my 50'th season, and obviously want to know something that /everyone else/ knows, what exactly is a safe zone?<br><br>Is this simply a zone that a MOB cannot path to? Or is there some other, darker meaning behind the term, 'Safe Zone.'<br><br>Please let us know.</b><br><br>That's pretty much it. Sitting in a place that an NPC can't get to in order to kill it (or rest up while that NPC is trying to reach you) is exploiting a safe spot.<br><br><br><b>I believe you misunderstood what YoodenVranx was trying to say, again. You are still in "defend our kael bug actions" and the question he asked didnt pertain to the Kael incident directly. He was asking why is there no fix to a bug, until someone exploits it?<br><br>You started explaining how the exploited ones are the most difficult to find, and never get reported.. That was not the question. You again said how Kael was a bug, and in fact did need to be fixed. We understand that too. That was not the question either.<br><br>It is not like you just dont hear about any smaller, unexploitable bugs at all. (That is what was implied when you said that the exploited ones are the hardest to find.) Saying that they are the hardest ones to find, means that you are just ignoring the easier ones to find, the ones that DO get reported, and DONT get fixed.(--Because they cannot be exploited so they therefore are no emergency patch, like he was saying--) Which was, in fact, the question that you scooted around both times.<br><br>To see you jump around the question like that, twice, is quite disturbing. I hope I have re-worded it in a way so you can understand what i am trying to say, if that was the problem.</b><br><br>Perhaps I didn't explain that well enough.<br><br>It's not always the ease with which a bug is found that determines when it gets fixed. Yes, a 'smaller' bug will often wait to be fixed behind a larger one, regardless of the effect of the bug. A bug that is causing barbarian kilts to turn pink will probably wait behind a bug that causes barbarians to take 50% more (or less) damage in combat.<br><br>But it also has to do with how easy it is to fix something. This aggro bug has, obviously, been pretty darn hard to pin down. Its importance has been high the whole time, but as you can tell by the fact that we already thought we had it fixed, fixing it hasn't been an easy thing.<br><br>The perception that we prioritize bugs based on some desire to be mean to our customers is a wrong. I can only guess as to its cause, but it appears to be that people take far more notice of the bug fixes that we make that they don't like than the ones that they do.<br><br>I'm certainly not scooting around. We fix bugs as fast as we can, prioritized by their affect on the game. There may be cases, and the aggro code is one, where the bug was introduced by a recent code change and fixing that might take priority over some older bug of similar import. But that happens as a matter of practicality. Someone was just looking at that code and it's ultimately easier to fix something that was just recently broken than something that will require research to reproduce and examine.<br><br><b>To be brief, I think the heart of the frustration you're seeing is from the fact that the pet aggro was a bug before this "abuse" was discovered. And what the general feeling is, is that there was no rush to fix this bug before, when it negativley impacted players, but now that there's a way that it can positivly impact them, it becomes a higher priority.. even though it's the same bug. Now I think that leads to the feeling some people get that "They don't care if their changes hurt me, but they'll 'nerf' anything that helps".</b><br><br>I understand that this is the issue.<br><br>The problem is timing. We have been working to fix the aggro bug since the last patch. We would have patched a fix for it next week in any case. The things going on in Kael haven't changed that at all. But because we also had to place a stopgap measure to prevent people from using this bug during the next week before we can get it patched, people have assumed that we are only fixing it because people were gaining easy experience and loot from it.<br><br>I can't help the timing. It just happens that way.<br><br><br><b>-Quote-<br>And we don't expect players to know everything that is and is not a bug. <br>-End Quote-<br><br>Two questions in response to this. <br><br>1. Why is then that a player gets a warning for abusing a bug they don't know about? If you don't have an in game method of informing the player base of new bugs that get warnings then I can't see how you honestly feel justified in warning/banning for any "bug."<br><br>2. Why is it that a warning never falls off the account?<br><br>I am not sure how it all works exactly, but if you had a warning 1 year ago, and a new bug comes out and you mistakenly "exploit" it then you get suspended since you had a previous warning.<br><br>I fight often in Kael, and the change in charm is a very annoying consequence, but by no means is it the end all for fighting in that area. Was the see invis in this zone changed when this code went in? The reason I ask is because the see invis guards near the arena no longer see invis.<br><br>When the real fix goes in will we be able to charm the giants just like before? <br><br>Please respond via email if you don't via the board. I really hate sending comments and never getting any answers to my questions.</b><br><br>1. Players get those warnings so they will know that they are doing something wrong. That's what the warnings are for. If we assumed that the player knew he was breaking the rules, then we wouldn't issue warnings at all, we'd just ban them.<br><br>2. Because warnings establish patterns. If someone is prone to cursing in public channels, then we want to know about it the next time that person is reported for cursing in public channels. If someone is warned once about abusing a safe spot, we want to know that when he does it again.<br><br>That sounds harsh, but it's not really. Most people that play will never get a warning. And most that are warned and told that fighting from a safe spot is wrong never do it again and don't have any problems. But if we don't issue warnings then players might not know that they are breaking a rule and we won't be able to get rid of people that cheat.<br><br>Remember, no warnings were issued over any of these aggro bug issues.<br><br>Those guards not seeing invisible is also a bug, expect that to be fixed next patch too.<br><br>Yes, we'll be reverting most of the giants to their old status with the patch. Some will remain uncharmable, but not very many and mostly merchants.</blockquote>
