He's a character who likes to go for the throat, but all you have to do is look beyond his colorful taunts. =)<br>This is about a GM Event. You have to treat your characters as if it was happening in real life to some degree.  If any of you have actually played a true role playing game with books, dice, and friends then you know what I'm talking about.<br>I'm sorry that the guy had to die 7 times, but you know what?  This guy should be able to now just sit back and laugh about the whole thing.  Many of us on EQ have similar stories that we could share and I bet many of em were over lv 6 and was losing MUCH XP doing it.  I even had a friend who played and died so much that he started to lose levels in one weekend! Poor guy was like lv 16 and was running across North and West Karana without a SoW on, then he couldn't find his first corpse for the longest time.  He just never would ask anyone for help, I guess because he felt so stupid. The only way I knew is that I did a /who all on him and noticed the level drop. This was also the same guy that I use to play D&amp;D with and he would bring 2 to 3 extra character sheets per game if that tells you anything about this guy =)<br>Moral of this story? Things could get worse =)<!--ktalk end_comment-->

How are these newbies suposed to enjoy the game if high level are creatures are kicking the shit out of them?  Wooohoo, fun quest.  &quot;Lets kill some EEs, oh no wait, we can't.  Lets call in the level 50s to get all the cool stuff while we die and get nothing.&quot;  Poor newbies.  Oh ya, I killed some EEs and they didnt have anything.  What fun.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Now, Verant says they're just trying to entertain us...fine.  But for a common bind area to become a zone of death is not entertaining; it is frustrating.  The whole point to cities is to present some genuinely safe area where you can restock/reorient after death.<br><br>In fact, in another post a few months back, Gordon said that his sympathy for casters who autofrag themselves (bind near something strong and KoS to them), because that's part of the Vision of risk involved in having the privelege.  This implied an attitude that you are in control of your risk vs. reward.  Yet verant takes AWAY that control by making cities and newbie zones areas of death from time to time. sure it's not very often. but their attitude strikes me as fundamentally wrong.  They keep saying risk management is supposed to be a key dynamic, and then they are quite happy to rob you of the ability to assess risk and decide your actions.<br><br>Maybe I'm alone here, but I see this as analogous to a game of football...there are rules and limits and idiosyncracies to the game. but some rules HAVE to be absolute.  If you could be in a huddle and the opponents were allowed to sneak up and red dog you till you were too injured to play, you'd probably not want to play the game.<br><br>Also, I'm rubbed wrong that Gordon seems to be saying &quot;well, as far as we know people liked the event&quot;...when during the KW event a ways back, while I wasn't there, 3-4 people said it was not their idea of a good time.  The polling question that was offered was constructed so that this reaction could not be entered. in fact, the polling question was oriented on &quot;how much do you approve&quot; with a vestigal &quot;how much do you disapprove&quot; portion.  This is extremely manipulative polling.<br><br>Just a lot of complaints hearing about this inspires....<br>  Radyek<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Jarguril end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->To start i dont use E-Mail so i didnt inc it.  But it seem like people will say anything when their &quot;name&quot; isn't out in the open.  My main chars is and has taken some spontaneous pols about GM &quot;events&quot;.  The choices are when asked what should be done about GM events,  (1) have more there aren't enough. (2) Only have them in zones with lots of room and generally few PCs (3) Eliminate them entirely.  Responsees from 112 people in my last one were (1) 13  (2) 53  (3) 42   There were 4 people that stated basically the same thing that they had not seen or been affected enough to form an oppinion.  As you might imagine i asked more than 112 people to get these responses and many were busy fighting or just passing through and in a hurry and said didnt have time.  These polls were done by going to at least 5 zones doing a who all and picking about 5% of the zones occupants at random.  This might tell Verant something about players oppinion on GM &quot;events&quot; and lead them to do some of their own polling.  Hopefully not by E-Mail i just delete mine unopened unless its from 1 of 4 places (people) that have required E_Mail responses.<!--ktalk end_comment-->
