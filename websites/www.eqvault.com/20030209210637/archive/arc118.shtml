John Smedley responded to another post regarding the FTC rules on the EQ Gameplay Board today.  Here's one of the first posts followed by Smed's response:<UL>The lowdown on the FTC rule is...<br><br>If you order goods by mail, phone, computer or fax (other than photo development, magazine subscriptions, seeds or plants), the Federal Trade Commission's Mail or Telephone Order Rule requires that the seller ship to you within the time promised or, if no time was stated, within 30 days. <br><br>If the seller cannot ship within those times, the seller must send you a notice with a new shipping date and offer you the option of canceling your order and getting a refund, or accepting the new date. If you opt for the second deadline, but the seller can't meet it, you must be sent a notice requesting your signature to agree to yet a third date. If you don't return the notice, your order must be automatically canceled and your money refunded. The seller must issue the refund promptly--within seven days if you paid by check or money order and within one billing cycle if you charged your purchase.<br><br>I guess Verant needs to learn that when it comes to violating consumer's rights...they're in our world now.<br><br>-archtype<br><br><b><i>I for one don't believe archtype doesn't have a right to be angry. In all honesty, I would probably be angry myself. We aren't running, hiding, or ducking any kind of responsibility in any way. We messed up and we have to make it right. It's as simple as that. Also, just because it's a "game" doesn't mean we don't have to deliver things on time.<br>With all that said, I can tell you that we've been doing virtually nothing but rectifying this problem. Also, I'd like to point out that we have extended our refund policy.<br><br>Archtype, do me a favor and email me all your info (including the tracking number Zomax gave you) and I'll be happy to check it out when I'm at work tomorrow morning.<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</b></i></UL>

Verant CEO John Smedley posted another update to the EQ Store situation on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>Hello All,<br><br>Many of you have been wondering why the EverQuest Store isn't up right now, so I'd like to take a moment to address this issue.<br><br>Obviously things didn't go smoothly in regards to the shipping to many people who bought Kunark. We're very sorry for the problems we have had. <br><br>We felt that until we have completely straightened out the problems with this process that it isn't fair to put it back up. We don't want to throw gasoline onto a fire.<br><br>We're taking the time to correct the back-end problems that caused this in the first place. Until we're satisfied that this process is completely smooth we won't be putting it back up.<br><br>As of now we don't have an ETA, but once we feel confident that we can deliver orders in a timely and efficent manner we will put it up. We will make sure to keep you all informed as to our progress towards this goal.<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</i></UL>

I'd also like to note that more people requested the move than we will be able to accommodate, and we appreciate everyone's understanding in this matter.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>He added another bit later on:<UL><i>I should also mention that the six servers involved in the split (Bristlebane, Veeshan, Xegony, Bertox, Saryrn, and The Seventh Hammer) will be down for roughly two or three hours longer than the other servers.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Gordon made a few more posts since the first of today's regular Infobit post.  Here's the newest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036439.html"><b>A 'No Nerf' Server</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why can't we have a server that does not have anything to with balance of power. This server will just add fun content. I mean if some class comes up with a good idea then they just add it. No more hearing that it will make things unbalance.]</i><P> One of the foundations of massively multiplayer gaming, and gaming in general for that matter, is that there must be challenge in order for the game to be fun. In this game, game balance is required for there to be a challenge. Implementing suggestions without concern for game balance would lead to there being less "fun" in our opinion. <P>Most of the people, even those who feel that there class is horrendously underpowered, would agree that if every suggestion, even every "good" suggestion, was implemented, that the game would be trivialized. In the end, we'd be constantly tuning things up, trying to reach a point where each class felt that they were powerful enough, yet when each individual class was enhanced, other classes would still feel that they get the short end of the stick. <P>Though it's somewhat taking it to extremes, the end result would be a game where every NPC had 1 hitpoint. At that point, every class would finally be immensely powerful, yet the game would be awfully boring.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036520.html"><b>Spell Casting & Animation</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: My character casts all his spells the same way (the same animation for casting). Since we have all these new emotes around, would it be possible to integrate that into the spells?]</i><P> Funny that you should mention that. Keep an eye on the gestures made by some of the higher level casters :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036581.html"><b>NPCs and Taunting</b></a><br>Some NPCs aren't tauntable. However, given the fact that you play on Morell-Thule, I'm pretty certain that you haven't reached many of those yet. <P>Taunt only makes the target hate you slightly more than it hates the next character on the list. It might be advantageous for the person you are trying to taunt the critter off of to back off a bit and let you get a bit of a head start before jumping back in.</UL>

Gordon officially announced the new Iksar faction changes on the Gameplay Board a few moments ago.  Here's the first post in <a href="">this thread</a>:<UL><I>Hello all,<br>The faction information on the live servers in reference to Iksar and how they interact with other factions outside Kunark is incorrect. Corrections will be going in tomorrow, making the Iksar KOS (Kill on Sight) to pretty much everything on the other continents. We normally wouldn't announce something like this, however we want to give Iksar who may have bound next to or near something that is liable to become KOS to them tomorrow a chance to get away.<br><br>This announcement is not meant to be a free license to go exploring the mainland with your Iksar tonight, and our plans to pre-announce issues such as this in the future hinge on players not taking advantage of the information. We appreciate everyone's cooperation. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Here's the second<UL>I assumed this was a bug, and was concerned that people who already have Iksar outside of Kunark might get themselves bound in an "infinite death" situation with no warning if you fixed it without announcing it. However, maybe a patch update message as well so people who don't come here will know?<br><br><b><i>Yes, I'll be putting one up shortly. Also, anyone ending up in any iksar ending up in a bind/death loop over this issue should /quit, log in another character, and /petition to arrange help out of the situation.<br><br>-Gordon</i></b></uL>Here's the third post:<UL>What about all the dark elf wizards who worship solusek ro? They are KOS in the outpost and the good city. No place to buy spells or get quests on the entire continent of Kunark. There are also dark elf rogues in a similar situation, and possibly some troll and ogre shamans as well.<br>Is this by design,<br> <br><b><i>Yes, this is by design. Venril Sathir doesn't exactly get along with all of the gods.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

EQ Executive Producer Brad McQuaid produced the following post on the Gameplay Board regarding some RoK speed issues:<UL><i>Just to clear up this rumor:<br><br>The trees swaying have NOTHING to do with framerate.<br><br>Two things affect framerate: number of polygons drawn, and fill rate (the number of objects in front of other objects in front of other objects, all of which have to be drawn).<br><br>Framerate goes down in a forest because of the additional polygons needed to respresent all the trees, as well as the trees behind the trees behind the trees having to be drawn.<br><br>Anyway, there are three general ways to increase your framerate (starting from easiest to hardest):<br><br>1. Adjust your clipping plane down under the display options section.<br><br>2. Buy a faster 3D card.<br><br>3. Upgrade your CPU/Computer<br><br>The level of 3D sound can also affect overall framerate, depending on your system's configuration (which sound card, etc.) so you might want to experiment with those settings as well.<br><br>Bottom line, Kunark pushes the EQ engine a lot harder, hence the better visuals. Even though this was perhaps a non-issue for you with the rest of Norrath, when you're on Kunark you might now need to adjust your display settings.<br><br>-Brad<br><br>ps. just to be very clear, the animating trees do not measurably affect your framerate.<br><br>pps. framerate is how fast your screen is updated and has little to do with 'lag', which is generally another word for 'latency' which has to do with internet performance (timing issues, sending data between your client and our servers).  hope that helps :)</i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn had the following to say about the preformance of Kunark hardware-size on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>As Brad mentioned in another thread, the swaying trees really have nothing to do with the framerates that people are getting. What is probably more responsible is the fact that the zones are very large and that we allow you to push your clipping plane out quite far.<br>The beautifully crafted landscapes of Kunark push the abilities of your graphics card and CPU further than the lands shipped with EQ proper. The outdoor zones are also densily populated with NPCs.<br><br>Bringing your clipping plane further in should help the framerate issues. We are also looking into seeing if we can make any further performance tweaks, but the issue is primarily caused by there being so much more to see on Kunark.<br><br>-Gordon</i></ul>

Once again Gordon Wrinn was on the boards responding to several different posts made by players.  Here's the latest directly from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036518.html"><b>Server Splits and Kunark</b></a><br>Subscribership at peak is the only reasonable way to decide what servers are split in what order. I realize that this has a few servers (espicially those that missed being in the top 4 by less than 100 people) upset, but we have to do it *somehow*. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Guilds C, D and E go to Kunark and start monopolizing everything.]</i><P> I'm pretty certain that 3 guilds, regardless of their size, can not monopolize Kunark. There is *so* much stuff to do there. Considering that information on the hardest zones hasn't been showing up on the web sites, I'd say that the guilds are spread a bit thin. <P><i>[Quote from original post: So I'm stuck running around Kunark enjoying the sites until everything in the freakin' zone agro's on me]</i><P> Good point. Even though as you mentioned that guilds C, D, and E are over there, it's far from monopolized.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036527.html"><b>Manual Links Broken on Official Site</b></a><br>They work now. It appears that it took the latest changes a little while to propagate. If you see any futher problems please let me know. <P>We've also put up an HTML version for anyone interested.<p><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036537.html"><b>Free Month Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Hmm.. do you get the free month from the retail kunark if your just upgrading?]</i><P> No. If you buy the complete version at retail and choose to use it to upgrade, you do not get a free month. You will only get the free month if you use the retail version to create a new account.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036513.html"><b>eBay Alive and Well?</b></a><br>Actually I just looked and it appears that there are about 1500 less auctions than there were a month ago. I'm happy to see some voluntary compliance out there with the rules against doing this. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Can't they just call Ebay and tell them they have banned the sale of items and to not allow it? If it is against their policy and these items are copywritten, why isnt this possible?]</i><P> There are other issues involved that I can't go into at present. Something like this should happen in the not-too-far-off future though.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036436.html"><b>Rogues and Disciplines</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Where are our other diciplines(sp?)? Monks and warriors get 9, we get 6. I heard that we get things like double backstab and assasination. Are these our replacements?]</i><P>Though I would be hesitant to call them "replacements" due to the connotation that something was taken away, rogues do have other upgrades which are probably more valuable than the other upgrades given to the other melee classes. The fact that they have more disciplines help balance that out. I still dislike the term "replacements" though :)<P>How about rather than saying that rogues are missing 3 disciplines, we say that warriors and monks get 3 extra ones? <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036306.html"><b>Will EQ ever be optimized for Direct3D?</b></a><br>I'm afraid I don't understand the quetsion. EQ is optimized for DirectX and the D3D APIs. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036410.html"><b>Response to a Letter About Hybrids</b></a><br>Though I don't wish to get too deep into this at this time, I would like to explain a few things. More is taken into account than skills. A level 60 hybrid with a 2HS skill of X is better with his sword than a level 40 warrior with the same skill value. In fact, all of the hybrids will be better at melee at level 60 than a level 50 warrior. They of course will not be as good as a level 60 warrior, but this should be understandable. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036403.html"><b>Dying in Veeshan's Peak</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I then thought about that. Once I reach L60, if I were to have my body with all the items I had gained over the last 100+ days of playing time, how would I feel. Then I asked myself why would they make a zone like this? I dont know, it doesnt sound like fun in any sense.]</i><P> Well I'm sure no one would be happy about losing a corpse, however if they are of the level and in a guild capable of doing that zone, there are probably a good number of spares running around that would make reequipping fairly painless.<p><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036249.html"><b>8 Hours to get Half a Bar into Level 51?</b></a><br>I saw a ranger on Veeshan Tuesday evening who was 53. The level curve from 50 to 60 does get progressively steeper, but there are far more things to kill that give experience, so its certainly reasonable.</UL>

A new <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h.html">Producer Letter</a> is up on the official site talking about the recent release of The Ruins of Kunark.  Here's the complete letter:<UL><i>Hello all, <br><br>On behalf of the entire EverQuest Team, it is with great pride that I announce the launch of the first EverQuest expansion &#8211; The Ruins of Kunark. This project was a labor of love for us, and I would like to say a few things about it for those of you who may be curious as to what it has to offer. <br><br>A little more than one year in creation, The Ruins of Kunark expansion adds breathtaking new zones, graphics, and enhanced abilities for high-level characters. The expansion is designed to take advantage of today&#8217;s higher performance computers, and offers an amazing and immersive visual experience, which we hope will captivate and delight Norrath&#8217;s inhabitants. In addition to offering amazing new vistas, The Ruins of Kunark will allow players to interact with many new creatures and monsters, including the new player race, the darkly enigmatic Iksar, the reptilian rulers of this forgotten continent. <br><br>The team responsible for The Ruins of Kunark includes the experienced development staff of the original EverQuest game, as well as the new EverQuest Live Team, who will be responsible for the ongoing development and maintenance of the game after the expansion. The Ruins of Kunark represents the fruits of years of experience of the original staff, integrated with the fresh new ideas of the EQ Live Team. As a team we have learned much, and grown with the help of our players, and we feel that it shows in this product. As a result, the lands of Kunark offer great adventure and excitement for everyone in Norrath, from lower level players, all the way up to the 60th level characters now possible with the purchase of the expansion. <br><br>We encourage you to take ship and explore this fascinating and dangerous new continent with us. We feel that the expansion will offer players both new and old a truly remarkable and rewarding experience. If you are one of the many thousands who have already opted to explore these uncharted lands, then we eagerly look forward to seeing you there. We have made every effort with the Ruins of Kunark expansion to provide the most compelling and complete content possible, and we hope that you will find this addition to the continually evolving world of Norrath to your liking. <br><br>Though we expect that the launch of the expansion will proceed smoothly, we will maintain the staff here at Verant Interactive around the clock to insure that everything will be performing as expected. As we anticipate customers in record number over the next few days, we ask for your understanding should any problems arise. We will do our utmost to resolve any issues quickly, and with a minimum of downtime or inconvenience. <br><br>In closing I would like to thank our loyal players, without whom this expansion would not be possible. We sincerely hope that you enjoy the new continent of Kunark as much as we enjoyed creating it, and we look forward to the future of EverQuest and hope to see you there as it unfolds. <br><br>Welcome to EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark! You&#8217;re in our world now! <br><br>For the EverQuest Team <br><br>Jeff Butler <br>Producer <br>EQ Live </i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn started a discussion about a few Bard issues on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the first post from <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036206.html">this thread</a>:<UL><I>Hello all,<br>Bard's currently have 2 songs that use mana, DDD being one of them, and it uses a *lot* of mana. We figure that there are probably a few bards out there who can cast 2 of these, but not many. <br><br>Since nothing that regens mana will help bards, and they only get 1pt/tick back, it takes a LONG time for them to recover from singing this song. <br><br>We've recently acquired the ability to place a song-specific recast time on the songs. We're considering replacing the mana requirement on the song with a 15 minute re-sing time. <br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Here's his second post in this thread:<UL>Interesting. How much mana would be recovered in 15 minutes though?<br><br><b><i>It currently takes a bard 80 minutes to recover the amount of mana required to sing DDD again. Basically, the proposed change would pretty much help everyone. The only people who might dislike it are the ones who have enough mana to sing DDD twice in a row. They wouldn't be able to do this if we make the change.<br><br>However, if we make the change everyone would be able to sing it 4 times per hour, which is more than anyone can sing it now.</b></i></UL>Here is his third post:<UL>First, is the intent to make DDD a "lay hands"/Discipline you can use every 15 minutes? Will this change require the bard to have the song memorized for 15 minutes before it becomes available the first time? <b><I><br><br>I wouldn't say that is the intent. Mana usage for songs was a way to allow us to create relatively powerful songs. Now that the resing delay works like a recast delay, it's not necessary that this spell use mana. We explored this option because of the new charm. Where we'd intended to only have the one song that used mana, now we suddenly have two that we need to control in the same way, but we really don't want to double the bards mana pool. That's why we are making this an option. </b></i><br><br>Second, with this, will we also see a change that will allow bards to regain mana faster through mana song/clarity? <b><I><br><br>No. Per the above, we'd still be using the mana as a balance mechanism for a very powerful song. </b></i><br><br>Third, is this primarily to allow bards to charm for limited amounts of time while still having the desperate dirge? Basically, shifting all of a bards mana towards charm? <b><I><br><br>I think I covered this under the first question. </b></i><P><br>So long as the 15 minute timer is independent of having the song memmed (as in, you sing it, mem another song in its place, and re-mem and sing it 15 minutes later instead of having to keep it memmed for the whole 15 min), <b><I><br><br>The resing delay would work by the same mechanism as the recast delay on spells, so when you memorized the song you would have to wait 15 minutes before you would be able to sing it.</b></i></UL>Here's the fourth:<UL>Alrighty... let's sum it up for all the bards to comment on=) Are you willing to accept a 15 minute recycle time (that means it will have to be memmed for 15 minutes before you can use it) on DDD in exchange for having it use 0 mana? <br><br><b><i>Teerog, a little off topic, but I'd like to thank you for your input on this board. You do a very good job of explaining things, and help build the community here on the board. I appreciate your input.</b></i><br></UL>

Gordon made a few more posts recently on the Gameplay Board.  Here they are:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036271.html"><b>Mana Stones and a Little Gordon History</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: My understanding is that Abashi came on board well after game release. Both as a player and customer service employee.]</i><P> Well I came to work for Verant in December of last year, however I've been in game since June of '98, and on various EQ boards since December of '97.<P> <i>[Quote from original post: Actually Abashi EARNED his manastone through hard work... leave the man alone, if you were a caster and could get one and they were in, you'd try too]</i><P> Yeah, me and the wizard I was with had about 20 deaths between us over that one. Getting into the room was the tough part, after that we did ok until a runner or two got away. Trying to make a sneak run into lower guk with 2 high 30s casters is a bit rough, espicially when you were the only two people in the zone.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036243.html"><b>Level 52 Beer Spell</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Please Verant why do I get a spell that summons beer at 52nd level.]</i><P> Roleplay.

Gordon responded to a few more board posts late this evening on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035935.html"><b>Veeshan's Peak</b></a><br>Just for a bit of clarification, back when the planes were brought online, John Smedley commented that people just don't die in planes, they die hard. Veeshan's Peak makes the planes look easy. There exists a non-negligible chance that not only will you die there, but you might not be able to raise the necessary forces to allow recovery of your corpse. It is *very* dangerous. <P>In order to avoid any appearance of impropriety in the zone, as sometimes follows when we've assisted in corpse recoveries in other zones due to claimed bug-deaths, we're not going to risk that for Veeshan's Peak. Veeshan's Peak is incredibly dangerous, and in order to guarantee that everyone is operating under the same set of conditions, we've elected to make the zone "enter at your own risk". <P>That said, there are no known bugs in the zone that would cause the death of a character, and it was tested extensively in the Ruins of Kunark beta. We will certainly investigate and eliminate any bugs that are reported, but we won't be reimbursing items or experience, nor will we be moving corpses or people within the zone.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036145.html"><b>Sharkjaw Baby</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: When I enable my Sharkjaw in my 2nd hand (warrior barb) it shrinks. It looks about 75% size. I looked at a friend and his ykesha was also shrunk in his 2nd hand ]</i><P>Thanks for the note, I'll pass the info on.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/034796-2.html"><b>More on Server Splits</b></a><br>We've postponed the server split for a bit as we didn't want to go taking down the servers for a while. When the split is being done, both the source and destination servers need to be offline. We'll probably do it by the end of this week.</UL>

Gordon has visited the Gameplay Board numerous times over the last 24 hours.  Here's the scoop on all of his latest:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036101.html"><b>Bard Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: There have been some excellent bard issue posts recently that (surprisingly to me) haven't included this issue. Still, this issue involves direct danger to bards, (unlike the issue of bards lacking a lvl 49 song), so perhaps it is better separated from such Abashi-ignorable discussion.]</i><P> It's looking at this time that there might not be a level 49 song. Geoff poured a bunch of good ideas into the 51+ songs. We would however be willing to entertain a discussion on this though.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036089.html"><b>Keeping Track of the Posts</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: One thing I think would help is a FAQ of your respones to the various game mechanics and class balance questions/rants. Recently I read your explanation of taunt on Castersrealm, if I hadn't of checked that site, I never would have seen it. I still don't know which thread you posted that response in.]</i><P> There's a couple of websites out there that do a pretty good job in cataloging our posts and maintaining a history. EQVault now provides a link to the original post with every quote, which makes it easier for people to come and commment. Some others are keeping ad hoc FAQs as well. <P>The reason that we don't want to do something official along these lines is that I'd hate to get into a situation where I'm constantly referring people to the FAQ. What I think would be helpful is if more people here would provide the information that they have knowledge of. I'd really like to see more of a community develop here. EQ Stratics has a good message board of this type. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036039.html"><b>Too Many Busy Signals on the Customer Support Lines</b></a><br>I agree, unfortunately phone lines and personnel are finite. There are just a bunch of people trying to get through to both places. This should clear up by the end of this week. We appreciate your patience.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036031.html"><b>Split Servers</b></a><br>The split process is a bit more complicated. Not only do we have to estimate the number of people on at peak, but we have to come up with a figure for how many people executing the /movelog command are actually peak players. That's why we open registration during peak hours, but it never stops a non-negligable percentage from off-peak from logging in to run the command. <P>It also doesn't take into account the number of people who have more than one account who'll run it for all of them. I know a few people who have upwards of 4 accounts, who only play one at a time. Of course I know two people who have 4 accounts and play all four at once too :)<P>There's a bit of trial and error involved. When we did the first split we took less people than we are taking with these. We now figure that we can safely move more people without risk of overcrowding the destination servers. We'll use data obtained in this process to further refine it for any future splits.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036005.html"><b>Alchemy Prices</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I am only 30 at alchemy, but have looked thorugh many of the potions. The only thing that I can make to sell so far is a SOW potion. No one wants to buy those stat potions that raise 2 stats 5 and drop one 5 for 10 to 12 plat. I noticed the regen potion will cost about 50pp to make. Don't think too many people will give me 75pp for 1 regen. Seems that alchemy could use a little revamping.]</i><P>We'll be able to start taking a look at these costs after things calm down a bit from the expansion rush. It sounds like some of the stuff is still a bit too expensive.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036021.html"><b>Questions about Iksar</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Please let me know if Iskars not being able to wear plate armor is intended?

This would essentially be a "personal pause" for the game, which doesn't go well with the idea of a massively multiplayer game. Now perhaps if we completely blanked the screen, disallowed chatting, and muted the speakers, and stopped healing and mana regen, it might be an option, but at that point we'd rather the person be out-of-game so that the servers don't have to track their status any longer.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035756.html"><b>Corpse Decay Information</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The .txt .doc and .html versions of the manual do not have the correct information about decay time on corpses. <P>Quoting from <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_guidefaq.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_guidefaq.html</a>  <P>Characters Level 6 and above: Corpse will disappear within 24 hours if the player is online (being at the Character Select screen STILL counts as online). Corpses will disappear within 1 week if the player is offline. Note: the amount of time you spend online, while a corpse is decaying, will be proportionally subtracted from the amount of offline time available. For example, if you are online for 12 of the 24 hours, your corpse will have 3 days and 12 hours of offline time (half of one week) available to it.]</i><P> Thanks, I'll double-check this and get whichever is wrong updated. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035713.html"><b>When Will the Store Return?</b></a><br>We'll be putting the store back up soon, we just want to make sure we get the current issues resolved before throwing any more orders into the system.

Eldrad the General sends word of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>The first Raid on Monster Island I put together a while back went really well, where we went and killed the dino in OOT.<br><br>But there's a new Monster Island for us to raid, on Kunark in the Field of Bone. This island is the home of The Tangrin, a giant ape. This ape is rumored to con red at level 51, he hits for around 200 points, and drops "some kind of hairy armor". I dunno if anyone has killed him yet on our server but someone told me he went down on Fennin (but of course they could have been making it all up too :)<br><br>Anyway, I'd like to get some 50ish groups together to take him out. This will need the forces needed to take on a dragon, most likely, only without giants to kill along the way. If you'd like to come, email me at eldrad@tarewmarr.net or find me in game.<br><br>We'll do it this saturday (4/29) at 3 PM EST, meeting in the Field of Bone zone, at the ruined building right near the swamp zone (to the right when you enter the zone from the swamp).<br><br>To get to the field of bone, I only know the way from the Fironia Vie outpost... From the outpost, find the bridge that leads off the island it's on, go off this bridge perfectly straight, run all the way to the end of the zone (sow and invis will help so the spider people don't see ya). At the end of the zone when you hit the mountain/cliff, turn left and follow the hill. Eventually the grass will turn icky and you'll know you're near the swamp. Just keep following the zone edge hill till you get there... In the swamp, keep LEFT following the zone edge hill. SOW and Invis will be needed as you'll be running past an entrance to Calibis. You'll know you're there when you see the stone tiled floor, don't go near the entrance just run past it, keeping left the whole way. I didn't run into any trouble at all. Just keep left the whole way in the swamp and you'll get to the field of bone. Approx running time from the outpost to the Field of Bone should be around 20 minutes total, with SOW on.<br><br>I'd also like to humbily request that any of the big guild types, please don't kill this guy before us. Reason is, I'm planning the event and I'd hate to find out the hard way that he's a 1 week spawn or something :( You can come along if you want, whatever, but please let us have this first shot at taking down king kong :) Thanks in advance :)</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

During this time of construction, we sent our chief scout, Molan Toejam, to do some initial exploration of this land and bring us word of his discoveries. Many dangerous creatures he faced in bringing us this information, and bravely he fought on this new land as he explored its secrets. When our faithful druid finally made his way back to us it was with great gain, and with great loss. </i></UL>Enjoy!

As the online persistent world category continues to grow and evolve, one of the most exciting aspects to watch is the way each new project reveals different design ideas and influences.  For this reason, it can be pretty difficult knowing that a potentially exciting project is in progress, but still waiting patiently until its developer is ready to unveil it.  A bit earlier today, Wombat Games formally announced Dark Zion, a game we&#8217;ve been waiting to learn about for some time, and one that seems certain to attract considerable interest from the online gaming community.  <br><br>At a time when game makers with experience creating online worlds are at a premium, Wombat&#8217;s co-founders include Rick Delaschmit, former Lead Programmer of Ultima Online, and Jason Spangler who held the same position on the Ultima Online: The Second Age expansion.  In addition, the team&#8217;s Creative Consultant is the internationally acclaimed New York Times best-selling author Tad Williams.  <br><br>To bring the online gaming community the best possible coverage of this exciting new title, the IGN Vault Network announces the opening of our latest dedicated site, <a href="http://dzvault.ign.com/">Dark Zion Vault</a>.  And as the highlight of our launch, we are pleased to present the first-ever exclusive and very extensive interview with the game&#8217;s principals at Wombat Games.  Here&#8217;s a brief summary of the game to pique your interest: <blockquote> Dark Zion is a player-driven, player-controlled persistent online world.  Players will have an unprecedented level of control over their environment; beyond building a character, a player will have the opportunity to build a business, a town, an army, even an entire society.  There will be no arbitrary quests or super-imposed events; the story is the success or failure of the world at large. </blockquote> Other features at Dark Zion Vault will include game information, news, concept art, screenshots, humor, reader and community participation features, humor and much more.  New features and content will begin to appear in the very near future.<br><br>We invite all members of the community who are interested in the future of online gaming to stop in and check out the coming excitement from Wombat Games and best-selling author Tad Williams at our brand new Dark Zion Vault.  Enjoy!

Mandos  of the <a href="http://www.loreseekers.com/">Lore Seekers</a> sent a very intriguing report detailing information about mysterious teleporters that will deliever a player to one of Norrath's major cities.  Here is the report, you'll need to highlight it with your mouse cursor to view it as some might consider this a spoiler:<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="white"><i>Honorable Guildmaster Sorontar:<br><br>As a Wizard, I am professionally interested in all things having to do<br>with ethereal transport.  As such, I was drawn to rumors concerning<br>firepots throughout the lands of Norrath.  These rumors spoke of an<br>ancient transport system "for those of evil race", which could be<br>accessed through having the appropriate "key", and inserting it (or<br>using it) with the appropriate "firepot" in a Norrathian city, to be<br>instantly transported to another city of Norrath, without the need of<br>spell, Wizard or Druid (shudder!).<br><br>Knowing that most ancient magic was not related to the evils that plague<br>Norrath, I have long discounted the likelihood that such devices, if<br>they existed, were for evil races' exclusive use.  Evil races are prone<br>to destruction, rarely creativity of any sort!  However, it has come to<br>my attention, that such teleportation devices do, in fact exist, and can<br>be utilized by all races.  However, their utility is, at this stage of<br>my investigation, limited to travel from one hub point to twelve (12) of<br>the cities of Norrath.<br><br>This hub point is deep under the Timorous Deep, located at -12260,<br>+4365, -277.  It came to my attention, that the top of a classic Combine<br>Era Wizard Spire, with its familiar four tines, was observable above the<br>waves in this depth of Ocean.  If you swim down directly between the<br>four tines, you will find a square opening on the ocean floor.<br>Descending, you will find yourself suddenly in air, in a square room,<br>with three firepots along each wall.  In the center burns a magic fire<br>of blue, such as can be seen at certain ancient Elvish and Combine<br>towers (e.g. Oasis).  Note that the descent from the surface is one way,<br>and I was unable to find any way to leave the room by normal means.  No<br>monster nor person disturbed my researches that followed.<br><br>Binding myself to the locale, I commenced to mediate on the twelve<br>firepots. It was immediately apparent that the style of each was<br>different, and each was familiar to a particular culture of Norrath.  I<br>proceeded to test my hypothesis, and touching the rust-colored low<br>firepot, similar to many in the city of my youth, found myself, being<br>dusted off by a very surprised guard (my second cousin, twice removed),<br>in Northern Felwithe.  Without answering my startled cousin's queries<br>(he knows I tend to gate around hastily...), I immediately gated back.<br>I tested all twelve pots, and here is the key of their wisdom:<br><br>North Left:(fire on floor)Grobb (entrance)<br>North Center:(6 side gray)Ogguk  (entrance)<br>North Right:(6 side tall)Erudin (near dock)<br><br>East Left:(6 side gray)Neriak Commons (entrance)<br>East Center:(4 side wood)Greater Faydark (under Kelethin)<br>East Right:(6 side rust)Northern Felwithe (entrance)<br><br>South Left:(Brown box)Halas(near dock)<br>South Center:(Dark with blue)East Freeport (on dock)<br>South Right:(tall gold vase)Cabilis West (entrance)<br><br>West Left:(White marble)South Kaladim (entrance)<br>West Center:(Lava Lamp)Akannon (entrance)<br>West Right:(torch stand)Rivervale (entrance)<br><br>It is to be noted that "the Black Hole", Qeynos, and Highpass, are not<br>represented here.<br><br>An intriguing question, beyond the origin of these firepots and their<br>creator's identity, is: "Are there other pots out there that bring you<br>to The Timorous Deep?"<br><br>Respectfully submitted,<br><br>Mandos Turambar, Wizard Peregrinator of the 48th Degree<br>Treasurer of the First Chapterhouse of the Seekers of Lore (Tarew Marr)</i></font></BLOCKQUOTE>This is a very interesting addition to the world of Norrath.

Gordon Wrinn just posted the following post on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>There's a couple of issues that have several threads running behind them. It might be easier for me to address them at one time:<br>Spirit of Scale:<br><br>We'll be making this spell group-only (e.g. must be grouped with target) shortly. This should alleviate people's concerns about it being used offensivly to harm other players.<br><br>Backstabbing Pets:<br><br>Up until the level 50+ pet spells, all pets were based off of warriors. We now have the ability to base pets off of other classes, and that's what's been done here. There are now rogue pets, wizard pets, and monk pets, which represent additional abilities for the pet-users above 50th level.<br><br>Rogues need not worry that a backstabbing pet somehow reduces the desirability of their class. First, the pet does not have the backstab skill that a rogue of that level would have, so they won't hit as often nor will they do as much damage. Furthermore, they don't have all of the stat bonuses that increase the rogues effectiveness. Certainly they can be buffed up, but they'll never come close to having a real rogue. Finally, rogue pets will never have the ability to double-backstab as rogues do.<br><br>Rogue pets won't be picking locks either, and there are quite a few places to do that in Kunark.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Garr sends word of a festival:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings! I invite everyone of the light races to come to the Festival of <br>Kunark this Saturday, April 29th. The Festival will start at 6:00pm CST in <br>the city of Firiona Vie. This will be the biggest and most involving Festival <br>ever, and its to welcome the new land Kunark! There will be drinks and events <br>like:<br><br>--Dueling--<br>Have an old grudge against someone? Settle it at the Festival in one on one <br>combat!<br>Charge: Free (Duh)<br><br>--The Gauntlet--<br>Think your tough, eh? Well prove it and go through the Gauntlet. You will go <br>through a series of battles. After each battle you win you will recieve 1 <br>'Greater Heal' or 5 minutes to meditate, then the next opponent will attack. <br>Your final opponent will be your lvl or as close as we can get to it. Any <br>interference will not be tolerated and you will be killed on sight but a DoT <br>or pet to prevent faction loss.<br>Minimum level: 30<br>Entry fee: 10pp<br>Level 50+ entry fee: 20pp<br><br>--Defend your race! 4 on 4 combat--<br>This event will be race vs race. You can have 4 people in your team, no more, <br>no less and they must be the same race team as you ((EX:Barbarian, Human, <br>Human, Erudite is ok... Wood elf, High elf, Human, Barbarian isnt ok)). The <br>teams must be within the lvl ranges below.:<br><br>Level Range and entry fee<br>1-10: 5pp per person<br>11-20: 8pp per person<br>21-29: 10pp per person<br>30-35: 15pp per person<br>36-40: 20pp per person<br>41-49: 25pp per person<br>50+: 30pp per person<br><br>The winners of each division will get the entry money as a reward and an item <br>(Hopefully, just thought of this a few minutes ago so I will have to run <br>around the next few days getting this planned). TEAM LEADERS, E-mail me at <br><a href="mailto:LordKesmai@aol.com">LordKesmai@aol.com</a> with your WHOLE teams Level, Race, Class and names.<br><br>--Guildwar--<br>Think your guild is the toughest? Well you get a chance to prove it! This <br>event is strictly for fun and not a grudge match, unless you want it to be <br>::Snickers::. Execute the /guildwar command on a guild and the opposing guild <br>will accept. The two guilds will battle and the last standing from whichever <br>guild will be the victor. If you die once in the war you will not be allowed <br>to re-enter the battle. At the end of the war the guilds will execute the <br>/Guildpeace command and the prize will be given to the victors guild. Theres <br>no restriction on how many can enter the battle. Give it all you can! Your <br>fighting for your guild!<br>Entry fee: 50pp per guild<br><br>--Story Telling--<br>Listen and learn about People you know, legends, creatures.

If <br>you have any stories you would like to tell E-Mail me at LordKesmai@aol.com <br>with your story and you can tell it at the Festival!<br>Charge: Free<br><br>--Hide and Seek--<br>Well this pretty much explains itself. One person hides ((IN THE ZONE)) and <br>everyone tries to find him/her. The person hiding will give clues through <br>Shouts about where he/she is.<br>Entry Fee: Free<br><br>--Scavenger Hunt!--<br>Get a team of 6 (Full Group) and according to your lvl range you will get a <br>list of items to find and the first to return with all of the items will get <br>an item or money.

Each question getting <br>progressively harder and the money you get per question you get right will <br>increase. Though, if you miss a question you are dead and loose all your <br>money. You can stop on any question you want before the question is asked.<br>Entry Fee:50pp per person<br><br>--------------AFTER HOURS----------------<br>The after hours festival will begin at 12:00pm CST.
