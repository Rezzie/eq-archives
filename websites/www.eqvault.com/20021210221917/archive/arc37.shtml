Inflation, as Milton Friedman pointed out in a Nobel Prize winning body of work, is when too many dollars chase too few goods. Deflation is the opposite; too few dollars in pursuit of too many goods. In the 1970&#8217;s in America for example, as the money supply (the amount of money in circulation) grew more quickly then the amount of goods and services available in the economy we had runaway inflation; a can of tuna fish might have the price tag raised on it three times before it left the shelf.</UL>Thanks Mandos!

Those looking for an alternative way to pay for your EQ account, Sony Online Entertainment announced something you'll want to check out:<UL>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br><br>SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT LIFTS INTERNATIONAL BARRIERS TO PLAY TOP ONLINE GAMES <br>-- Online Gaming Set to Explode Worldwide With All-New Payment Options Available <br>--<br><br>SAN DIEGO, CA - May 24, 2001 - In an effort to expand online gaming globally, <br>Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) announced today that two alternative payment <br>methods will be available for SOE's massively multiplayer games.  Game Cards <br>will be sold in retail stores this fall throughout Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia <br>as well as North America.  Additionally, JCB (Japanese Credit Bureau) credit <br>cards are now accepted, making EverQuest(r) and SOE's other massively multiplayer <br>games more accessible to an international audience. <br><br>Currently, SOE requires an American credit card number to subscribe to the online <br>game and ultimately this has limited EverQuest's growth abroad.  Game Cards will <br>allow cash holders to experience the best-selling online game of all time in <br>90-day increments and will be available on retail shelves worldwide. <br><br>The JCB Card offers a great opportunity for SOE to reach gamers in Japan and <br>many other Asian countries.  With over 40 million cardmembers worldwide, JCB's <br>sophisticated global payment system network has made it the number one card in <br>Japan and number four internationally among all of the major credit cards. <br><br>"There has been a universal increase in demand for access to our best-selling <br>game, and now we have found a way to reach this broader market by changing our <br>billing methodology," said Scott McDaniel, Vice President of Marketing, Sony <br>Online Entertainment. "We're looking forward to inviting a whole new group of <br>players into the world of EverQuest."<br><br>The EverQuest online game currently boasts more than 385,000 active subscribers, <br>and recently released a popular expansion pack to the game, EverQuest(r): The <br>Scars of Velious(tm), last Fall.  During peak periods, more than 90,000 adventurers <br>and dragon slayers have explored the EverQuest world simultaneously.  The active <br>global EverQuest(r) subscriber base is comprised of players from various countries <br>throughout the "real" world, including the U.S., England, Canada, Singapore, <br>Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy, Germany and New Zealand. </UL>

Your comments of Gnoll teeth or Lizzard Tails in Ferrott, yes it is a nice little add on for stuff that you are going to kill anyway, but that is not the type of quest that we are talking about. (Bye the way, The DF Belts....that is a quest that should be eliminated as it creates more fights over KS'ing and who had the camp first than anything else.) <br><br>You also have quests like running from Oggok to Neriak to make a delivery, or the bard note quest....sure another great add on if I am going that way any how. Again, not what we are talking about. <br><br>A number of people have said it. We, the lower levels, are dying to see high level type stuff. The only way to get there is to fill up that gold bar. And again, the quests just do not fill the bill. (Did i mention that I am impatient?) The quests that many have been trying to explain to you is stuff will develop the character, see the world sorta stuff. The "Lore, No Drop" stuff is right on, as is requiring different skills to accomplish the task. Something like combineing in a Lore, No Drop box, stuff from the far corners. Faiery boots from Gfay, Sandshark meat from Erudin, a Lizzrd doll from Ferrott, A rare leaf from the Overthere, A mammoth whisker from Everfrost. All No Drop, Lore. Give us lower levels, lower level epic quests, not necessarily for items, but for exp. Just make it worth our while to be "(For)Ever Questing". <br><br>Munpoppy <br>22 Ogre ShadowKnight <br>Bertox Server ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I've received about an equal number of responses from people saying that they hate quests that make them travel as those that say that travel is one of their favorite parts of quests. <br><br>Regardless, you can travel and see the world without having a quest. I know a lot of folks that simply make up their own reasons to visit other places (such as their High Elf wanting to see the library at Erudin). Developing your character is not entirely our responsibility, most of that falls onto the player. <br><br>But I do agree that there will always be more things that we can do to help out in that department. <br><br>-Fix- wrote: <br><br>Greetings ! <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just an idea here, but maybe some NPC's (like hometown NPC's) could only give quests to those who have a very good (or very bad) faction with particular mobs. <br><br>For example, let's imagine a sailor in a freeport bar, talking about his trips around Norrath. During his adventures, a dragon attacked his ship, and slew all his comrades. <br><br>Maybe this sailor could only give his revenge quest to those who have a BAD faction with dragons, and not just a good faction with him. <br><br>This way a sergeant in Kelethin could give a quest to a foreigner who slew many orcs in Everfrost, because he would then have a reputation of orc slayer. <br><br>Just an idea here, but having to destroy factions to make some quests could force people to make choices instead of trying to always have a good faction with everyone. ]</i></font><br><br>Very interesting idea. I'm not sure how practical it is, but it's certainly interesting. Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>More Server Populations and Economies</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have been watching this thread for some time and I like many of the suggestions that were made. It has gotten me to thinking of some possibilities that may be feasible. The idea of item decay and maintenance is a good one, if only implemented correctly. Now I realize that these are just suggestions and may not make it into the current game but, maybe they will see light in some future incarnation of a MMORPG. <br><br>The idea is that items have a certain quality or power value. As a characters xp and level increase then the character's equipped items values decrease in an equal amount. This can be justified as use of the items. The items don't decrease just because you have them but rather as the result of quantifiable use. The value can be viewed by right clicking the object and looking at it's bar. As the bar decreases so does it's usefulness. Damage ratios go down, beneficial effects go down, AC goes down, etc. <br><br>Now in order to return the item back to it's original usefulness you must find a PC tradesman of appropriate skill for the item. The person with the item and the tradesman must be grouped and at the towns forge, spinning wheel, etc. and both must enter items for the repair of the item in a trade like window. For example: <br><br>Lany the bard's lambent breastplate is down to half power it's AC 10 of 20. He takes it to Sampson the blacksmith. Sampson and Lany group at the forge and Sampson adds a specially crafted hammer (this hammer would have taken a great deal of plat, ore, molds and such to make), metal bits and water. Lany adds a lambent stone, a gem and 100pp. They click the forge button and Lany gets back the breastplate plus the power goes up based on the value of the items in the forge. Sampson gets back his hammer and the rest is consumed. They both also get some xp. <br><br>You could adjust what is needed based on the item and how much power needs to go up. Some things will be always required such as the hammer, lambent stone and gem. The plat could be adjusted for how much increase is desired. Like a heal, 100pp - minor healing +20 power, 200pp - greater healing +50 power. This way players can decide when they want to repair their items and at what cost. If an item is left to go to zero power there could be a chance it breaks. <br><br>Better items would have higher power and therefore longer lifespans and inferior items shorter lifespans but cheaper to repair. The reason that I suggested xp gain for repair is so the tradesman could reasonable pursue that as a profession. This also has the advantage of limiting abuse as it consequently lowers the power rating of equipped items thus necessitating additional repairs. <br><br>Here is a quick rundown of the advantages and disadvantages: <br><br>ADVANTAGES<br>1. Creates a viable alternative to hack and slash<br>2. Helps make trade skills more useful<br>3. Creates a money sink<br>4. Creates an item sink <br><br>DISADVANTAGES<br>1. Coding all items with power ratings<br>2. Creating new interface for repair (trade window mechanics are already in game however)<br>3. Tracking power ratings when items are traded (items with charges are already in game)<br>4. It's something new, players may not like it (item decay and repair is in many popular games) <br><br>These are just my suggestions hopefully your programmers and glean something viable out of them. <br><br>Faejon Dorunrun<br>Captain / Webmaster<br>Battle Cry of Terris-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>That's a nice way to do it. But it is still item decay, and there is one key item you left off of your evaluation, a disadvantage. Tedium. Nobody is really going to want to go to battle with each of their armor pieces down a few AC points. People will want to maintain them at full value, and doing so will be tedious. That is the nature of item decay, and that's why I'm not a big fan of it.</UL>

Erica sent us this bit of news today:<UL>SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT TO BEGIN LOCALIZING <br>ONLINE GAMES TO FOUR LANGUAGES <br>-- SOE Set to Expand Lines of Communication Internationally For Best-Selling <br>       <br>Massively Multiplayer Online Games --<br><br>SAN DIEGO, CA - May 22, 2001 - Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) announced today <br>that they have begun localization for several games at The Station, (www.station.com) <br>allowing them to support a global community.  The initial phase of localization <br>involves both human and automated translating agents, beginning with French, <br>German, Japanese and Korean.  The localization will allow players to fully interact <br>textually within the game in their own language. SOE is committed to making its <br>incredible array of online games just as accessible to gamers around the world <br>as they currently are to English speaking players.<br>	<br>"The vision of a global gaming community has always been the core of our business <br>model," said Kelly Flock, President, Sony Online Entertainment. "The localization <br>allows us to surpass language barriers and give gamers worldwide the best online <br>gaming experience."<br> <br>Leading off the localized products is EverQuest(r): The Shadows of Luclin(tm), <br>the third expansion pack to EverQuest, the most successful online role-playing <br>game of all time boasting more than 375,000 active subscribers comprise of players <br>from all over the world. Other games planned for localization include: PlanetSide(tm), <br>the world's first massively multiplayer first-person action game set in a persistent <br>world and Star Wars(r) Galaxies(tm), an online game set within the Star Wars <br>universe.<br><br>SOE has already begun the multi-language duplication process for several games. <br>The identical version preserves the look and feel of the game while making it <br>accessible to a foreign language audience.  SOE's plans include the use of real-time <br>machine translation of in-game player chat.  This will allow players to chat <br>even if they do not share a common language.  The combination of localization <br>and advanced translation software will facilitate SOE's position as a worldwide <br>leader in massively multiplayer online games.</UL>

From Aracnakat:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Wizards</a>.  They are the master seekers of knowledge, and their talents and spells are focused on this goal. They use powerful spells to not only see things from afar, but to transport them there as well. This thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals... but how much more is there to know? <br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about these casters of mass destruction.  Teleporting people around isn't the only thing that they do well.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Wizards of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

So I will. :)<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I wanted to post a few quick points here regarding the Coldain ring and shawl quests in hopes that I can answer many emails at once=). <br><br>- There is an interim reward for the ninth ring which recently had it's name changed to that of the player to first complete this leg of the quest. It's stats were to be reduced at the same time, but that didn't make it in the last patch. It will be changed to the intended status in the next patch. The original item will not change, it was a reward for those courageous enough to attempt this quest first. The flipside of this is that some of the shawls had been upgraded since I initially wrote the quests and those of you who have attained these items will see a difference in them after the upcoming patch. Sorry for any inconvenience. <br><br>- When fashioning the final ring, I sat down with Lawrence 'the spell guy' Poe and discussed potential stacking issues. It's as conflict-free as is possible at this time. <br><br>- If you fail the skill check when crafting a shawl you will get the previous shawl back, this has been the case since the quests went live. <br><br>That's it for now. Thanks for all the great emails! <br><br>- Steve Burke <br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing For Experience</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'd like to post a continuation of my previous writ. I knew you were going to answer as you have, Alan, I knew it :)  Literally minutes after hitting the submit button I knew I should have continued it to include what your reply would be. Oh well, we can take the future, but we cannot take back the past. <br><br>Anyway, yes, you can have fun and get experience. However, most of the time, camping is the fastest way to get experience. There is a trade off to be made. I can think 'hmm, now that I'm level 25 I'm going to go back to my homeland in Kelethin and see how everything is with my ranger guild. Perhaps there is a bigger orc to slay and the local rangers just aren't cutting it'. That would be a fun thing to do, go back to your hometown and see what is shaking. You could do that, or you might be thinking 'you know, I'd really like to go to the Plane of Hate and teach those dark elves a lesson by slaying their god'. That is fun too. Hence the delema, you can do fun things at your level, or you can do not-as-fun-things which get you more experience so that you can enjoy the upper level content sooner. Thus is the reason that I go for experience. I am willing to sacrifice a little bit of fun now so that I can get to the really fun stuff that I know is at the upper end of the game. Or at least I'm told it is more fun by my higher level friends. <br><br>I'm not trying to justify either side or saying that one style of play is better than the other. You simply asked why people do things that are not as fun, and I'm answering by saying that they are giving up fun now in order to get to the upper end of the game faster, where they think there is more fun. <br><br>Whim Dreamstalker <br>49 enchie (got some levels since last time)<br>EMarr <br><br>PS if you are going to add in new quests, would you think about adding more in your guild? The only reason I ever go back to the enchanter guild is to buy spells. If there were more quests to be done at higher levels in your home guild, we might go back for more. It just seems odd that the guildmasters are some of the highest level NPCs around, and all they oncern themselves with is collecting deathfist slashed belts. <br><br>One more thing, it would be nice if people in your guild reacted differently to you as you go up in level. Imagine how cool to walk back to your monk guild as an Iksar swifttail once you have reached level 50 and seeing Master Glox, who normally ignores everyone, look up and say "I aknowledge you as my pupil". Or even better, once you have acheived 60, to see Master Glox himself stand up and bow to you saying 'you have surpassed your teacher, and thus give me the greatest honor you could ever possibly bestow. I am glad to have known you, [name]."]</i></font> <br><br>Now I've become predictable&#8230; drats. <br>:)<br><br>Well, there really is no 'justification' needed for either side of this discussion. Some people prefer to take the more expedient way experience gain, some would rather do what is more fun. That's all about personal preferences, and nobody can refute a personal preference. <br><br>A quest that starts with your guild master wouldn't really have you hanging out there very much, but more likely popping in two more times. But it's a good idea. It makes sense that, while the primary concern of the guild masters are the young members of the guild, they would be a good source of information for high level characters. <br><br>And, yes, it would be neat if your NPC guildmates reacted differently to you based on what you've achieved. I'll pass the idea on.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000150.html"><b>PvP Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: There is an article of a supposed interview with Abashi here:<br><a href="http://www.lumthemad.net/news/2004.php">http://www.lumthemad.net/news/2004.php</a> <br><br>Although I don't believe it there are some people who do, discussing it on the newbie zone in the thread:<br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/001657.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/001657.html</a><br><br>So as not to confuse people and to avoid the "you promised us X!!" comments later, a public denial or acceptance of this interview might be appropriate. <br><br>- Mahkahl ]</i></font><br><br>That was most certainly an interview with Gordon Wrinn.

From Jonathan Grey:<BLOCKQUOTE>EVERYTHING HERE IS SIMPLY MY IMPRESSION from what I<br>was told by Verant employees. I do not guarantee the<br>authenticity of either the information I received, nor<br>do I take responsibility for my own, potentially<br>erroneous interpretation of any aspect of Luclin that<br>they discussed with me. I was told that Luclin is<br>still very far from release and many details have not<br>been finalized. I would not be at all surprised if<br>many of the features/details I mention below change <br>before Luclin is released.<br><br>Onto the info:<br><br>* The Beastlord class will be heavily pet dependent and<br>  will probably, at the highest levels, create a pet<br>  that is at least 10 levels lower than your character.<br>  On the other hand, the Beastlord will have a variety<br>  of buffs that will work only on his own pet (though<br>  he will have other buffs that can be used on other<br>  characters/pets) which could effectively increase<br>  the capability of the pet by a factor of 10 levels or<br>  more.<br><br>  When I mentioned that this would cause problems with<br>  aggro (i.e. low level pets causing everything green<br>  to jump it) I was told that aggro is being redesigned<br>  to take buffs and overall strengths of the pet into<br>  consideration.<br><br>* Beastlord pets quite possibly will not be able to<br>  persist through zoning due to the unusually large<br>  difficulty of getting npcs to zone.<br><br>* Expect some aspects of Beastlords to be very similar<br>  to existing hybrids, except with Shaman spells.<br>  (At the same time I heard someone say that they'll<br>  be totally different from hybrids with a lot of<br>  unique spells, and more of a pet class, so I'm not<br>  sure they're too solid on this.)<br><br>* Beastlord pets will be unique and will not be the<br>  same as Shaman pets, or any other pets currently<br>  in the game. The pet selection will vary depending<br>  on the race of the Beastlord.<br><br>* The Bazaar zone will be in a central city located<br>  on Luclin that is neutral to all races. The city<br>  itself will be bordered by four different dungeons.<br><br>  The Bazaar will feature a variety of named and<br>  differently colored tents to make it easy to tell<br>  players where you will be meeting them, and will<br>  feature a bank. Additionally, the city will be, or<br>  be right next to, the primary entry point for <br>  Luclin, to make getting there convenient.<br><br>* Similar to Velious, there probably won't be any<br>  factions that are correlated with factions in<br>  the rest of Norrath, with the possible exception<br>  of Kerran/Var Shir (since they are related.)<br>  This is because Luclin has been cut off from<br>  the rest of Norrath for quite some time.<br><br>* You will be able to play from level 1 to level<br>  60 without ever leaving Luclin.<br><br>* It is quite probable that existing characters<br>  will be given a one-time-only option to pick<br>  a new face when Luclin is released.<br><br>* On a somewhat related note, Var Shir (Kerran)<br>  models will not only feature different faces,<br>  but entirely different matching skin patterns. In<br>  addition to the tiger Var Shir pictured in<br>  the E3 screenshots, there may be black panther<br>  Var Shir, lions, leopards, etc.<br><br>* I asked about the alternative character<br>  development and was told that there would be<br>  new skills available for characters who are<br>  level 60. To get and increase these skills,<br>  you will need to spend experience you get<br>  that is over the experience you needed for<br>  level 60. (Currently any experience you get<br>  over level 60 isn't really important, aside<br>  from the death penalty.) You may also be<br>  able to spend your post-60 experience on<br>  perks like purchasing a title ("Bob the<br>  vindicator", etc.)<br><br>* Armor now can have its own geometry. If<br>  you take a look at the screenshots from E3,<br>  you'll notice that human armor plates go<br>  beyond the shoulders of the player model.<br>  Expect to see armors that significantly<br>  alter the appearance of a character due<br>  to the ability to create different shaped<br>  armor.<br><br>* The trees in Luclin very possibly will not be<br>  animated, as people have pointed out from the<br>  screenshot. An artist I spoke to said that this<br>  is due to the mostly negative reaction to having<br>  tree animations in the previous expansions.<br><br>Jonathan Grey<br>Paladin of Letalis Ericius <br>E'Ci</BLOCKQUOTE>The report is much appreciated, thanks Jonathan!

Shelby sent a few of her observations of the next expnasion made while at e3:<BLOCKQUOTE>A couple of things you might notice while your at e3, are that there are now<br>2 clipping planes.  The one we are all used to, and another that draws the<br>grasses, you can adjust both of them, or even turn off the grasses.  Another<br>note that the zone they were displaying the tree's werent moving.  Static,<br>unlike kunark.  Also be sure to check out the gremblin model, I havent seen<br>any screen shots of it yet, but it looks like a skinny version of the gnome.<br>Also be sure to check out the new emotes.  There are 2 that I saw.  The new<br>emotes are great, the mouths open, the eye brows raise up, some neat facial<br>effects.  Also the new sky effects, we are going to see some really neat new<br>skies, coloring and transparancy levels also.   These info bits are<br>something that I havent seen on any site yet, and wanted to let everyone<br>know.<br><br>Shelby</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Rick sent in the following announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings Citizens of Norrath!<br><br> The Combine Empire is holding a grand event to celebrate its revival and rise back to power. This 'Celebration of the Rebirth' will be taking place in the Northern reaches of the desert of Ro (SUN MAY 20, 8:00 EST). Our healers will be setting up a medical station at the inn for young adventurers who wish to help patrol the desert (free heals and buffs to newcomers) and perhaps distributing some equipment to those wishing to pursue a life as a human purist crusader. <br><br> I urge all Humans as well as our pureblooded Erudite and Barbarian kin to attend this fair and join us in the celebration. As always no heathen races (non-human team) will be tolerated at the festivities and any caught will suffer a most heinous public execution.<br><br> A special invite goes out to our most valued allies the Shanks who have always stood by the side of the Empire in times of need.<br><br>Emperor Forestal of the Combine</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.
