Back on the Gameplay Board, Alan made <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042342.html">one huge post</a> about the recent issues troubling the Shaman class:<UL><i>Hi everyone, <br><br>I've taken a bunch of topics out of various posts and cobbled together this monster. I ended up not getting the names of the original posters, I hope you can forgive me if I don't attribute your posts or your ideas. I guess I'm more interested in addressing the ideas than giving credit&#8230; <br><br>First, some news about a few things: <br><br>1) Despite what I previously wrote about our satisfaction with the 55th level pet spell, we are still looking at it. I'm not promising any changes. But the debate continues&#8230; <br><br>2) The Rage Line: All the spells in the line should be working along the same lines as Rage now. But we did find an error. Fury was (is) giving a dex debuff instead of a dex buff. That should be fixed with our next patch (though there is no date set for a patch yet). There were some stacking issues to consider. We've looked them over, and they are working the way they should work. So, yes, it does overwrite some stat buffs and not others. That's the way it's going to stay. Changing anything about the way they stack would undoubtedly cause other stacking issues, and nobody wants that. :)<br><br>Ok, on to the various post snips. Keep in mind that this is sort of a first run through. You're getting my ideas and comments here, not company policy. I'm trying to get my ducks in a row so that I can present cogent ideas to the team. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Icons for group disease and poison buff - when applied, the icon appears exactly the same as if you are poisoned or diseased, would it be possible to tint the icons blue so people know its a buff and not a dot. This also applies for the druid group resist fire and cold.]></i></font> <br><br>Actually, I think a lot of icons probably need to be redone. It's something that I really would like to see get a revamp. But, really, this isn't a Shaman thing, it's something that everyone would probably like. I'm not ignoring this idea, just moving it off this thread and into my want list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Alchemy - 2 things <br><br>1) NPC merchants will only buy back potions for between 9 gold and 2 plat, regardless of the cost to make the potion. Could this be made more in line with jewlry, maybe were merchants can buy back potions for 80 - 90% of the cost. Currently, the cost of practicing is enormious with no chance of profit in the end. I spent 2500 pp to practice the other day, and went from a skill of 50 to 90, to practice above this level will cost between 15pp - 200pp per attempt.]></i></font> <br><br>I'll ask into it. But keep in mind that trade skills are designed to only be profitable when items are sold to players. But if the return isn't at least reasonable when selling to vendors, I'll see if I can find out why. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Currently only SOW potions have any demand at all, and occasionaly gate potions if people can afford them (cheaper to pay a druid or wizard). Could new gate potions be added to the new expansions zones?]></i></font> <br><br>I'll look into it. But my first thought is that Velious is designed to be hard to get to, so that's unlikely. And, well, it might not be the intent of Alchemy to reduce the need to have a wizard or druid to zap you around the globe. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Torpor &#8211; Doesn&#8217;t stack with chloroplast/regrowth, spirit of wolf, Turgur&#8217;s Insects, Ignite Blood, Plague, Celestial Elixer. None of these cases make sense except for SoW. We are not asking for Torpor to cancel DOTs, just stack with them, as well as CE and regen. In addition this spell hardly compares to other class Lvl 60 spells, with only 1200 hp total heal and all the negative effects, feel free to make it useful.]></i></font> <br><br>Well, stacking regens is always going to be very limited. And it makes some sense to me that you can't go into torpor while under a DoT. It's a lot of healing for little mana. It greatly reduces downtime. Personally, I think it's fine as is. But feel free to try to convince me otherwise. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Avatar &#8211; Does not stack with Focus of Spirit and Wolf Form. Even if you want to make some of the components (str for example) not stack please make the overall buff and non-redundant parts of these stack. This is not the main problem however, which is that for 325 mana, a 1 minute duration and a 3 minute recast, with quite questionable benefits (for example this is not anywhere near what 70% haste spells do), shamans do not use this spell at all.]></i></font> <br><br>Again, it seems like a great spell to me. Perhaps others can wade in here and explain to me why this isn't a good spell. Keep in mind that stacking is a very complicated issue. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Talisman of the Serpent &#8211; Most shamans consider this spell nothing less than an insult. Please just remove it. If you are feeling generous replace it with something a little more useful, a group Talisman of Kragg would be OK.]></i></font> <br><br>Not all spells will be 'A' list spells. There's no real reason to remove this spell. Heck, if you're playing with a lot of bards&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Stacking of Curse of Spirits, effect on epic weapon Spear of Fate- Splurt, Choke, Ignite Blood all overwrite it. It does not take on someone with Skin Like Nature series buff on. These are all obviously oversights on your part please correct.]></i></font> <br><br>I'll look into it and see if these are, in fact, oversights or if they are as intended. It's not so obvious to me&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Tigir&#8217;s Insects &#8211; Range of the area effect is pretty darned small. As this spell is so rare most shamans don&#8217;t have it yet to complain about this, but they will.]></i></font> <br><br>Well, there are a fair number of spells with a very small area of effect. It takes a bit of skill to land on a lot of targets, but it can be done. Keep in mind that monsters don&#8217;t have much, er&#8230; volume, so they can be stacked very close together. This doesn't seem like something that needs to be changed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It's pretty obvious from the original spell listing that shamans were designed as a generalist priest class with the following features: <br>1. Buffs far beyond any other class<br>2. Debuffing abilities somewhat better than an enchanter.<br>3. Second-tier healing. Similar to druids in straight heals, with regeneration spells to help.<br>4. Strong, but limited (only two) Damage over Time lines.<br>5. Use of a second-tier pet at higher level<br>6. Slightly better melee skills than the other priests. <br>Sound about right?]></i></font> <br><br>Sounds right to me, for the most part. I have a disagreement with point #2, but I'll get to that in a second. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: On the face, it sounds like a good plan. The realities of play at level 50 had some interesting effects: <br>1. Stats were never implemented in a manner to make stat buffs overly useful. The ratio of their effect to mana expendature make them iffy to use in a lot of circumstances. The lines of buffs that did really matter (AC, HP, melee speed) were done better by clerics, and about equivalently to enchanters.]></i></font> <br><br>And later you mentioned something about buffs not being mana efficient either. Honestly, mana efficiency isn't the end-all and be-all of determining the value of a class. It's a consideration, but it's not the only thing that matters. The ability to do something that is useful might fully overpower the idea that you can't do it efficiently. Tell me if I'm wrong here, but shaman do have the most efficient buffs (with perhaps the noted exception of AC and HP by clerics and attack speed by enchanters). You must be comparing efficiently, I guess, to just blasting things. Keep in mind, though, that blasting things may not always be an option. Buffing the melee types in some cases might be more efficient. <br><br>But I'm willing to accept your comments as they are, even if I might not believe in them as strongly as you do. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. This worked pretty much as planned. Enchanters did most of our abilities at a slightly lower level, and mages could do resist debuffing at a lower level of effectiveness.]></i></font> <br><br>Actually, I had always thought that enchanters were supposed to be the masters of debuffing. For me, the current setup seems just right on this account. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Worked as planned.<br>4. Worked as planned, but got hit by a nerf aimed to stop kiting, which was never our forte anyway.]></i></font> <br><br>Good enough. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. Went okay here. The only real problem was our pet got hit by some changes aimed at reigning in the power of the pets that WERE problematic, namely necro and mage pets.]></i></font> <br>Goodness, pets again! :)<br><br>But, essentially, pets for shaman work as intended, right? They add a bit of damage and tanking, and they look cool. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6. True, but largely irrelevant since at higher levels, necessity really dictates the higher efficiency of medding over melee in most situations, and we were never close in combat effectiveness anyway.]></i></font> <br><br>But not at all irrelevant to those in the level to use it. The ability for a shaman to melee pretty well makes the earlier levels a fairly easy go for them. Again, I think this works out well enough. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So we got hit by a couple nerfs aimed at others, and the "king of buffs" title was both misleading and largely useless, but all in all, it was a good class. What happened with Kunark? Well, look at the spell list as a whole: <br><br>1. We got a TON of buffs. All 5 stats get a bigger version AND all 5 get group versions. About a third of the RoK spell list is buffs.]></i></font> <br><br>I gather you disagree with the continuance of buffs as the main focus of shaman. I think I understand this, and I'll bring it to the team. Don't, however, expect a revamp of all the spells post 50. It's not very likely that we'll be suddenly changing all buffs to DD spells or something wild like that. As you stated, up to 50 shamans are pretty darn great. I'm of the opinion that buffs are part of that greatness. But I think I see what you're getting at. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Nice slow upgrade at 51, with still a slim lead over enchanters, but the Mage Mala line is much closer to our Malo than previously. In fact, from 51 to 59, mages have the same single-target debuff spell as shamans.]></i></font> <br><br>I guess this means that you're ok with the progression, and just upset that magicians have gained that type of spell. I'm not a big fan of the spreading of abilities over classes either. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Worked okay. We got superior heal finally, as well as Regrowth and Torpor (once in its current version) to help. Fizzle rates are insane on superior heal, but the design idea was right.]></i></font> <br><br>All 'secondary' powerful spells like that have a bit more fizzle to them. You're not alone in that. And it is, frankly, just another drawback to the spell. Personally, I'm not sure that shaman should have superior healing&#8230; it's not unlike giving mages Malosi&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. Necros get our prized #1 DoT spell (Envenomed Bolt) at 51, then several upgrades. Druids get two DoT upgrades by 54. Shamans don't get their DoT updates -- and somewhat disappointing ones -- at 56 and 59!]></i></font> <br><br>Confusion! You don't get he upgrades at all, or you're disappointed with them&#8230; <br><br>I looked it up. They seem to be there. In fact, here's what Everlore says about Pox of Bertoxxulous: <br><br>"This is believed to be the best DoT in game. It is the last Shaman DoT, doing close to 2100 damage."<br><br>Not that I hold everything on spoiler sites to be the gospel truth&#8230; :)<br><br>Please, give me some detail as to why these upgrades are disappointing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. The pet upgrade is only minimally better than the 49 pet while hitting a HUGE cost increase. Our second-tier pet actually becomes third-tier as by level 60, Shadowknights have better pets.]></i></font> <br><br>I know&#8230; I know. We're still looking into this one. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Now, as I mentioned, at 50 shamans were a pretty strong class, and it's probably true that a slight cut in overall power relative to the other classes wasn't out of line. But virtually every defining factor of the class was given a terribly minor update, save one. And, in a lot of cases, we were matched or surpassed by other classes in areas we'd been the specialists in.]></i></font> <br><br>I disagree with the minor update thing. And, well, if you agree that shaman were perhaps on the top few rungs at 50, then how else would you suggest we upgrade them? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The one that takes up over a third of our spell list: buffs. <br>It's really puzzling. One gets the feeling that the live team doesn't really quite grasp the role of the shaman in high level play, and although they think they're giving us key improvements in our major areas, we see them as near-worthless toss-ins that add to the pile of low-value spells that take the place that more interesting or useful spells could go. What's more, impinging on our REAL defining abilities by other classes is okay because they're not viewed by the design team as being shaman core abilities.]></i></font> <br><br>It seems that it's worthwhile to have a talk about stat buffs in house. But, well, I'm not convinced that they rate as&#8230; how did you put it&#8230; near-worthless. As for giving out core abilities to other classes, well, I don't like that either. It's always a fine line, though, between making classes playable and keeping things distinct for them as well. This is something that I also want to bring up to the team. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: A prime example of this would be the abilities of the class breastplates. In Kunark, the shaman BP casts a damage shield. This is really puzzling since apart from alchemy, we don't have damage shields, and the damage from it (5 points) is tiny... the real effect is the AC buff it provides. In Velious, the shaman BP casts a stamina buff. While not totally useless, it's hardly what we'd expect, when comparing our effects to say that of clerics (who get Complete Heal and Celestial Elixir).]></i></font> <br><br>I don't want to make this into an item discussion&#8230; I really think those sorts of things are best served in a different thread. But I'll mention this to the team as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'm not talking about the strength of the spells. It's that the clerics (and other casting classes) seem to be getting spells that are central to their function in game -- primary healing. Whereas an ac buff+damage shield and stamina buff seem to say a shaman's primary function is to buff. When it's not true at all -- our primary function is generally to DEBUFF. More appropriate spells would be things like Turgur's Insects, Malosi, or Cripple.]></i></font> <br><br>Well, this seems to be where you and I depart philosophy. Maybe it's just me, I don't know. The damage shield obviously isn't part of your core function as a shaman. But buffing really is. Debuffing is a secondary thing. But, as I've said, I'll talk this over with the team. Contrary to popular belief, we do have people that play shaman on the team&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think this is the primary obstacle between the designers and players -- as far as the players are concerned, shamans just aren't there to buff. We may do it, but it's not why we're needed in the high level game, and it's not our major contribution to the group. With the game mechanics as they are, this is not likely to change. What DOES need re-evaluating is the priority that function is given when designing shaman spell lists and assigning appropriate effects to class-specific items.]></i></font> <br><br>Again, perhaps&#8230; Buffing is certainly something that is a primary focus at lower levels. Obviously, as you've stated, you think that focus changes post 50. And, again, I'll talk to the team about it. <br><br>Wow. I'm sorry this thing ran so long. I'm just probing for ideas and clarifications, and letting you know where I stand and what I think. Feel free to try to change my mind. It doesn't really seem that, reading over all the threads, there is all that much that you're unhappy with. I guess I'm a bit shocked to see so many posts about shamans lately&#8230; <br><br>Alan</i></UL>

One of the most rare spawns in Norrath is being targeted by TigerT Wyldfyre and his jolly crew:<blockquote>A few guilds are joining forces once again to perform an unprecedented sneak<br>attack on the newly discovered North Pole Zone and the dungeon hidden within<br>called Santa's Workshop!

Alan summed up the situation with Lure spells in the following <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041945.html">message he posted</a> on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>I just wanted to summarize what is happening and what has happened with Lure spells (hopefully I understand it).<br><br>Three weeks ago, the resist rates for NPCs in regards to Lure was fixed. This means, basically, that they will resist Lures that they are supposed to resists (a fire creature might now resist a fire-based Lure that it did not resist before). This change really shouldn't have affected most wizards, once they realized the change and adjusted tactics accordingly. It is my fault for not informing you of the change. For that I'm sorry.<br><br>However, all the talk about changes to this line of spells brought about a more in-depth look at how they work, leading to this post by one of our programmers (given in full here for your enjoyment):<br><br>"After looking closely at the way saves are done when the target is higher level than the caster, it appears that Lures would get saving throws in situations where they should not. I'm fixing it now, it should go on test shortly. <br><br>So to make everyone happy, the target of a lure spell will NOT get a saving throw addition if it's higher level than the caster. I thought this already was the case, it was not. <br><br>Currently on live some NPCs are getting saves versus lures that they should not be getting."<br><br>This change, however, will not take effect until we patch next. With the holidays on us, it's hard to tell when that will be.<br><br>So, over all, Lure should actually become a more powerful line of spells, for those that are fully aware of their proper use&#8230;<br><br>Alan</I></UL>

Verant's Unzun <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041494.html">made an announcement</a> concerning the Lure series of spells on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>There is a nasty rumour floating around that something will be changed in the overall way that NPCs save against the Lure series of spells this upcoming patch. This is NOT true. Lure saves at one time were SUPPOSED to be like lifetap saves, but this did not happen. They are currently more like Dragon Breath saves, which is better for the caster, worse for the target. They will CONTINUE to be that way!<br>About 3 weeks ago dragon breath saves were adjusted, and that resulted in some few NPCS saving SLIGHTLY better saves vs certain lures, but this change happened about a month ago on test, 3 weeks ago on live, and lures will continue to work as dragon breath type saves, that will not change.<br><br>In an irc chat it was incorrectly stated, that Lures would be treated as lifetap saves, let me repeat, this is NOT true. Lures are treated as Dragon breath type saves both before and after tonights patch.</i></UL>

Along with Patch Day comes a new Patch Message and today is no exception:<UL>December 19th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Today's patch primarily consists of tuning of Velious zones as well as content and other additions.  In addition, the following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<br><br>- High-end items that have a activatable (right-click) healing effect have in several cases had their casting times increased.  <br>- Factions for some of the higher end encounters in Velious have received some adjustments.  Basically, "bad acts" receive more weight than "good acts".  For instance, if "A" hates "B" and "B" hates "A", killing "A" will hurt your faction with "A" more than it will help your faction with "B".<br>- The stamina reduction with "Resurrection Effects" has been replaced by a slight attack-speed debuff.<br>- The Ranger's Trueshot discipline now works correctly.  It was previously only working versus other player characters.<br>- The Shadow Knight's "Unholy Aura" discipline has received an enhancement.  When in use, harmtouch resistances will be checked versus disease instead of magic.  In addition, harmtouch will resist in the same fashion as lifetap spells, meaning that unless the creature is immune to disease, you should get full damage most of the time.<br>- The spell attached to the "Fiery Defender" can now be partially resisted instead of being "all or nothing".  The net result is that the average damage will be higher.<br>- The Paladin "Holy Forge" discipline will now give paladins triple the normal chance of scoring a critical hit.  Each critical hit has a percent chance to be scored as a critical blow.<br>- Added parameters to the /camp command (the command that will cause you to camp out if you are already sitting).  "/camp server" will take you back to the server selection screen.  "/camp desktop" will take you out to the desktop following a successful camp.  Despite popular request, "/camp spawn" will not be implemented.<br>- Walruses now indeed sound like they should.<br>- Added the /chatfontsize [0 to 5] (default is 1) command.  This command will allow players to adjust the size of the font in the chat window.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

While our tradesmen are all masters of their craft failure on certain items cannot be ruled out. In this unlikely event we cannot reimburse for the cost of the components.<br> <br>Should you lack some of the minor components we can provide those for you at cost price. We will set up a network of travellers to be able to get the things that you may require. For example if you have the pelts for leather armour but no patterns we will purchase the patterns for you, the only charge we would make is the pattern cost.<br> <br>In the event that you do not have any of the required components we will have a team of sellers in the tunnel offering completed crafted goods for reasonable prices that you may wish to purchase.<br> <br>Our sellers will also be offering some non craftable weapons, armour, and other desireable items for sale.<br> <br>Also on the day we will have a pages and runes giveaway, a few competitions which will be announced on the day and a fine steel giveaway to low level Characters.<br> <br>Please join us to celebrate our first Christmas on XEV.

A site, which mimics the look and content of the official EQ site, was recently discovered to contain an ActiveX backdoor Trojan Horse.

In any case, please feel free to send out the alarm.</i></UL> Gordon also included some important information to tell if you have it, and how to remove it:<UL>**HOW TO TELL IF YOU ARE INFECTED** <br>Go to your start button, press run. Type in msconfig and hit return. Click<br>on the startup tab. Look in the list presented for an instance of ; <br>run= onz.exe <br>If you have this entry, you will need to manually remove it. To remove this<br>back door; <br>1) Uncheck the check mark next to the run= onz.exe line and then click the<br>apply button at the bottom of the window. <br>2) Click on the general tab then click on advanced on the bottom of the<br>window. Check the "enable startup menu" check box, click ok. Click ok again,<br>and allow system to reboot. <br>3) DO NOT let the system boot normally. You MUST select "Safe command<br>prompt" from the boot menu. <br>4) At the DOS prompt, type in "cd windows" (or the path to your window<br>directory), press the enter key. <br>5) Type in "del onz.exe" and then press the enter key. <br>6) Reboot your system again. <br>7) Select "normal" from the boot menu. <br>8) If you get a window stating that the system can NOT find onz.exe, click<br>ok. <br>a. Click the Windows Start Button and then click Run. <br>b. Type in "system.ini". <br>c. You will now see a line that's looks like this; shell=Explorer.exe<br>onz.exe. <br>d. Remove the instance of onz.exe so it looks like this; shell=Explorer.exe.<br><br>e. Save the changes to the file and then reboot once more. <br>You have now removed the trojan from your system. </UL>As long as you haven't stumbled onto this site in the past, or visit it now of course, you should be fine.<br><br>Thanks Gordon!

Here's the latest from Alan from off of the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041366.html"><b>Characters Per Account</b></a><br>From what I hear by asking around the office, there is no limit to the total number of characters that you can create, beyond the eight per server. <br><br>Though I have no idea why you would have had problems making new characters&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041401.html"><b>Antonica Out of Date</b></a><br>We reserve the right to do just as you've suggested at any time in the future. With the original game we have to stick to our original system specifications. But there is no reason that we can't use some of the new ideas on the old world. And don't be too surprised if we do&#8230; :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041154.html"><b>Pet UI Suggestions</b></a><br>I've forwarded this one to Rowyl. He's on a well deserved vacation, though, so don't expect a fast reply...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041216.html"><b>Verant Doesn't Care?</b></a><br>Morgian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Well said Moiira and Noonga I'm very sorry you got no help from Lithgar. I'm wondering if others on Povar have gotten -expanded- assistance from any GMs or Guides and if so then there's no reason whatsoever that he couldn't have helped you more regardless of the policies." ]</i></font><br><br>That's not true at all. <br><br>In fact, the exact opposite is true. There should be no exceptions to any company customer service policy. Such things undermine the whole structure of your customer service organization.<br> <br>In this case (from what I understand of it), no exception should have been made. GMs should not be spawning quest NPCs just because the player was unaware of the nature of the NPC in question. <br><br>If there is a flaw here, it's with the quest design, not the way customer service was given. And until I learn more about the quest design, I'm going to reserve comments about the quest design. <br><br>Hadesblood said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Your right Verant doesn't give a rats a-s-s about the average client because they boast 300,000 plus account with more suckers buying it all the time( the actual number is probably around 180,000). <br><br>However verants we dont give a damm about the little guy is going to hurt them when the Online massive game market explodes with competition." ]></i></font><br><br>Actually, we have over 300,000 active subscribers. <br><br>But you know what, all of them are important. I think you do our players a disservice by calling any of them the 'little guy'. Caring about all of your customers is important. Helping each of them individually is a pretty massive challenge. We do our best. <br><br>Noonga wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "1) Verant did not design this quest to be done without reading spoilers. (now I know) <br>2) Verant won't even recognize that it is a frustrating quest. (if you don't read spoilers.) <br>3) Verant doesn't care how long it takes to do the quest. I guess they figure if they make ya do it over, then there is more money for them. Just an assessment."]></i></font> <br><br>I don't know about #1. I agree with you that a quest should be relatively self contained. No, we don't really want you going to spoiler sites for information. However, unlike your earlier claim, it is perfectly reasonable to expect you to talk to higher level characters for hints. In fact, making it so that other players are good sources of information is a good thing, EverQuest is, after all, a social game. <br><br>#2 &#8211; Well, there will always be a fine line between hard and frustrating. And what frustrates you might be the perfect level of challenge for the next person. It's our nearly impossible job to find a place where more people are challenge than bored, and as few people are frustrated as possible. <br><br>My brother, for example, builds puzzles for fun. Me, I would rather eat them. I don't have the patients for it. It's all about how you work as a person, and how well we can anticipate the reactions of over one quarter of a million people&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "And try getting hold of Absor. Unless you post something great to him "Thank you Absor!" or ask them what color they like, its VERY unlikely to get a response from him on an issue such as this." ]></i></font><br><br>Actually, so far I've answered almost every e-mail that I've received. And I respond to any thread that I have an answer for. <br><br>But the question is, what sort of answer are you looking for? My answer, if you really want one, is simple. The GM responded to you in exactly the right way. He was polite and correct. The quest is as it is. It isn't broken. Is it too frustrating for you? It seems so. I'm not happy about that. But I can't change it either. <br><br>About the more general question, should people need to read spoiler sites to do quest? Well, the answer there is pretty easy too. How did that information get to the spoiler site? Someone did the quest first, and without spoiler site help. <br><br>Yes, I would like to see more information available in game. But there is a time when too much information makes it less of a quest and more of a&#8230; what did you call it&#8230; 'Everread' situation. We don&#8217;t want quests to be like those choose your own adventure books either, where you're just reading along and picking yes or no at the end of each paragraph until you get to the end and have to kill something. <br><br>In any case, I have summarized your concern and mailed it to the team. I do agree that there should be enough information to complete every quest without going to the spoiler sites. But this case is&#8230; well, it's borderline. You could, obviously, have completed the quest the first time. But was there enough information there for you? I don't know. I've mentioned it to the team, and I'm sure a debate will ensue about it. But, well, I don't think this quest will be changed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Now, Verant wishes me to kill this thing without reason? ]</i></font><br><br>Well, um&#8230; you are a paladin, right? It was a thing of the living dead, right? :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041319.html"><b>Enchanter Isses</b></a><br>Mike wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Despite his personal feelings Absor *WILL STILL BRING THESE REQUESTS TO THE DESIGN TEAM*."]></i></font> <br><br>And I have. Enchanters won't be getting those illusions. The consensus was that they remain unique to those classes. And, it turns out, that I'm not the only person that thinks that undead illusions for enchanters was a mistake. <br><br>Though there was some talk of new illusions based on some of the existing global models, there probably won't be any in the near future. I'm sorry. <br><br>ScarletGhost said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Please stop with the 'no room' excuse. It's getting old and tired and totally un-believable considering that you clearly can make room for other classes."]></i></font> <br><br>Well, it&#8217;s a reason, not an excuse. Yes, we made a decision to use freed up memory space to add those two forms for those two classes. That does not mean that we can ignore the initial system requirements. <br><br>We may not all agree with that decision, but there are no excuses here. <br><br>So far as making bear or spectre available to enchanters as an illusion, the decision is that those forms will remain the distinct province of those classes that have them now. <br><br>And, due to the current restrictions, no new enchanter illusions will be added. <br><br>There might still be some chance that we'll get Illusion: gender functional and add that. And it might be possible that one or more of the existing global models will be made into illusions, that's still under discussion. But right now, things are probably going to remain as they are. <br><br>I know this won't please many of you. For that I'm sorry. And I hope I've explained the technical, gameplay and philosophical reasons for these decisions well enough.</UL>

Shadoe has written his latest editorial entitled <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid977096102,98665,">Role-Playing: The Delicate Art of Storytelling</a>.  It's now available to read in Shadoe's Corner.  Here's a clip:<ul>Those of you who follow <A HREF="http://eqx.simplenet.com/">EverQuest Express</A> every week know by now that the story I've been working on for the past year has finally crawled out of its primeval soup and seen the light of day. The prologue and chapter one have at last been published, and each successive week will reveal another chapter.  Having this, my first <I>real</I> fictional piece, out in the open for everyone to see is an enormous step for me emotionally.  But I'm eager to share it with you all, as I surely think it's a story worth telling.<br><br>Reading the first chapter again at EQX has given me time to reflect on where this all began, and how it evolved into a novel-length tale.  Initially, the plot began with two characters my wife and I created on the Test Server.  As time went on, more and more plot segments fell into place until I was presented with an actual story to tell - something I could work with to bring the world of Norrath alive for myself.</ul>Check it out!
