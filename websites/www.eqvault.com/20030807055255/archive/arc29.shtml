The Roleplaying Server and a few spell issues are the highlight of today's infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000290.html"><b>Fear and Bear Form</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just went on a raid thru that old portal-o-fun in Freerott. During the buff phase the lady necro at the portal spawned and got off a fear on me. Well, actually more like 3 or 4 before the mop-up squad noticed her. The last of the fears actually managed to stick. When it hit, my bearform (spirit of the great bear) was over-written. Is it intentional or a bug that Fear line overwrites bearform? <br><br>- Tyck of RN ]</i></font><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>This is a new one to me. I honestly have no idea why this is happening, but I'll look into it and try to get it fixed as soon as possible. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html"><b>On Roleplaying Server</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I realize I sent these questions earlier, but I haven't seen a response While the issue of the "Examine" option has been discussed, I haven't seen a leaning to keeping it and was wondering if I am one of the few that feel this option should be removed. <br><br>The questions are: <br><br>1. Will we be allowed to have identical names? (Are there not many Johns in the world?) ]</i></font><br><br>Nope. Sure, it's possible to have the same name as someone else in real life. But there are two reasons why it can't happen in Norrath. Character models are not people. I have several friends named Brian, and I can tell one from another at a hundred paces pretty easily. Unfortunately in Norrath that's not as easy. Names help to differential characters. <br><br>But more importantly, having the same name as someone else would be a real mess. It helps a lot if every character has a unique name so the server can tell one of you from another. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. What are the penalties for not Rping? What are the guidelines for being in character? (I am tired of being berated by people who say - what level are you and then scoff when I say I am 18th season or I am in my 18th cycle of training. Or have names like Illeatyourliver or Priesto). ]</i></font><br><br>Well, that's the real meat of the whole debate, for me at least. <br><br>If you can describe to me how to distinguish roleplaying from not roleplaying definitively in every instance, then I'll come up with a set of punishments. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. Is it even being considered to do away with the examine option? If someone wants to see what I have on - they can look at my picture or ask me. Perhaps, make it so if someone wants to examine they need your permission. I equate someone examining me as the same as going through my clothes, lifting my cloak out of the way to see my tunic, etc. . . and I feel that is rude (As do everyone who asks permission to examine and doesn't just examine at will) and in no way necessary to a total RP server. ]</i></font><br><br>Another endless argument. The emotional response to being inspected can't be overcome. But inspection is in the game because it allows characters to 'see' what they should already be able to see that isn't displayed by the game engine. Yes, you CAN see a tunic under a cloak, unless the wearer of that cloak is spending all of his time holding it tightly closed with both hands. And, well, in Norrath you can't even see that cloak. Inspection allows people to actually see what you are wearing. If you find that rude, then it is probably best that you turn off your inspection messages. <br><br>Let's not get into this debate again, since it's one of those that just never ends&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. While I agree that for religion it would be most unlikely that an Iksar would worship a Halfling god, I do not think it is too far fetched to believe the same Iksar would not believe in any god. (Right now, if you are an Iksar - you believe in Cazic-Thule) Can you make it so every race has at least have the option of being agnostic? (Clerics, Paladins, Shadow Knights and Necromancers aside of course) ]</i></font><br><br>The world of Norrath is largely built with some assumptions in mind. Player character Iksar, for example, all worship Cazic-Thule. Those that do not are outcasts. While there are certainly some valid and interesting ideas about allowing PCs to play outcasts, setting that up isn't as easy as just flipping a switch. We'd have to redesign a whole bunch of stuff. After all, such Iksar would be KOS in Cabilis. <br><br>The same pretty much goes for all of the other requests for changes (Gnome Shadowknights, Dwarven Bards, X race worshipping Y god&#8230;). It's not that there is no way that such a thing could happen. It's just that Norrath exists with things as they are and such changes wouldn't necessarily be improvements, they'd just be changes. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Again these are a repeat of the questions I asked earlier, but haven't seen any answer in the previous postings. (Plus I hope to put the RP Server News discussion back near the top.) <br><br>Thanks and keep up the good work. <br><br>Skrax Swifttail - Monk on Fennin Ro ]</i></font><br><br>Sorry I missed it the first time. <br><br>And for the many that have asked, we don't have an e.t.a. for this server yet. I'll announce it the moment I have one.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000291.html"><b>Enchanter Spell Stacking</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 1.) The Enchanter spell Boon of the Garou has issues with the Bard epic Dance of the Blade. If Boon is on first there are no stacking problems, however if the bard epic makes it way into a buff slot first Boon will not be able to be cast. <br><br>2.) The Enchanter dot line(Gasping Embrace, Asphyixiate), do not stack with the Shaman epic in the same manner. If the Shaman epic is put on first, Enchanter dot will go on fine. If Enchanter dot is on first the Shaman epic will not stack. <br><br>-Ouden Soulshaper, 59th Enchanter<br>The Relentless, Cazic-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>There are currently some stacking issues with bards that I am looking into. I can't really tell you much more than that right now, but it's being looked at. <br><br>As for the Choke Line and the Shaman epic. currently these two spells never stack. If the stronger spell is applied first you will get a "your spell did not take hold" message. If the weaker version is applied first you will not get a message but the weaker spell will be overwritten. That being said, I will try to rectify this conflict by the next patch. <br><br>Thanks for the feedback. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>--<br>Numruk wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote:Enchanter Mez does not overwrite the clearly inferior Screaming Terror necro mez spell... which makes using it in a group with an enchanter a Bad Thing (tm). Are there any plans to change it to get overwritten by enchanter mez?]</i></font> <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I could probably make this happen. I'll see if I can figure something out before the next patch. <br><br>Thanks for the suggestion. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------</UL>

A variety of topics were addressed on the Developer's Board by Alan VanCouvering today.  Read all it here:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000285.html"><b>Celestial Healing and Skin Like Nature Follow-up</b></a><br>Vasudeva_SK wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "I just went on the Test server and was able to stack Skin Like Nature and the Celestial Heal spells. Perhaps there was another spell causing the conflict?" <br><br>Try Chloroplast. It doesn't stack with Celestial Heal and is often cast along with SLN. ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for the tip. <br><br>Also, as with the comments in the other Celestial Healing post, the spell acts as a buff, so if you don't have an open buff slot Celestial Healing won't stick.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000284.html"><b>Celestial Healing and Posion Follow-up</b></a><br>Trisden wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Possibly the people who are having problems with Celestial Healing have the max amount of buffs up already. I have run into that problem several times.]</i></font> <br><br>That's certainly one possibility. <br><br>-Tamria- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Is the poster sure it was poison and not disease? I'm pretty sure disease prevents celestial. Maybe there's a poison that prevents regen of hp and therefore it might have the same stacking issue as being diseased?]</i></font> <br><br>That's also possible. <br><br>If anyone can reproduce this problem for us, let me know. So far, we've got a lot of educated guesses. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000267.html"><b>Character Transfers & Hotkeys</b></a><br>Stewed231 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi guys, <br><br>My characters have been transferred, and thank you very much for the service. <br><br>One thing I didn't know - ALL my hotkeys are gone.<br>I know they're dtored on users PCs, not servers, so is there a way for me to map the appropriate file that contains all my hotkeys to the character on the new server. <br><br>Thanks. ]</i></font><br><br>You're hot keys and other information for each character is stored in an *.opt file. <br><br>For example: absor_02.opt <br><br>The _02 is the number of the server the character is on. <br><br>Now that you've had your character moved to a new server you should see two *.opt files with that character's name on them in your EverQuest directory. <br><br>First, make a copy of both files to someplace in another directory, so you can replace them if my advice turns out to be goofy&#8230; <br><br>Then just figure out which file is the older one. That file should be the one from your old server, with your old information on it. Delete the newer *.opt file and rename the old one to match the new one. <br><br>For example. <br><br>absor_02.opt Dated 3-3-2000<br>absor_34.opt Dated 8-19-2001 <br><br><br>The _34 must be the new file for the character on the new server (make sure to log into the character once, or this file might not exist). <br><br>I would delete the absor_34.opt file and rename the absor_02.opt file as absor_34.opt <br><br>Now, I haven't tried this myself, but it should work. And if it goes all wrong, just copy and paste the reserve files back into the directory.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000283.html"><b>About Denizens</b></a><br>Antsy wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: ...it looks like an animal...but cockatrices apparently aren't animals. Is this intentional? ]</i></font><br><br>That's a mystical beast, much like the unicorn, and not an animal.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000282.html"><b>The Reaver</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think the idea of situational weapons is a great one, however, I just don't see how a sword that grants +12 to all saves (ie makes you tougher just by holding it) could NOT be magical. Psionically imbued perhaps? <br><br>Just my two cents, <br><br>Aillron Lifereaver ]</i></font><br><br>Well, therein lies the problem. <br><br>It might indeed be magical (though it could be argued that it isn't). But being magical and being magical in the way needed to hit creatures that are resistant to non-magical weapons isn't the same thing. <br><br>Perhaps there is a magical gem of protection on the weapon, and otherwise it's not magical. So it can offer protection but still not be able to harm creatures that are immune to normal weapons. <br><br>Unfortunately, the denotation of 'magical' in EverQuest means both, or either&#8230; The two concepts are marked with one bit of data. <br><br>In this case the weapon does indeed have some magical qualities, but the blade itself is not magical.</UL>

Here's the latest round of Infobits directly from the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000282.html"><b>The Reaver</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Dead Absor, <br><br>I was wondering if you could answer a question for me. The Reaver off the Statue of Rallos Zek (which if you havn't had the displeasure is a VERY tough 7 day spawn giant badboy) Ammong his other drops are the BP of eradication an amazing BP, swiftblade of zek (an amazing 1h weapon) Hammer of battle (also an amazing weapon) and the reaver. <br><br>The Reaver is 36/40 and grants +12 to all saves. The problem is it is NOT a magic weapon. <br><br>The other weapons listed are all magic, I was wondering if it is a bug that the reaver is not? I'm assuming it is as the mob that drops it is consistent with the stats of the weapon (as a magic weapon) <br><br>Thank you for looking into this, <br><br>Galidin ]</i></font><br><br>This is not a bug. This is intentional. <br><br>This is a good example of a situational weapon. It's a very good weapon, but one that you can't use all the time, thus creating a decision for the character about what equipment to use and even what equipment to carry as spares.<br><br>--<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I noticed that the last poster addressed his email to "Dead Absor". My questions are: Are you really dead? When did you die? Have you been dead all along? Did it have anything to do with you eating that pie? <br><br>And lastly, would The Reaver work against you, or are you INVULNERABLE? <br><br>Meirn Sageth<br>Xegony ]</i></font><br><br>Answers: <br><br>As far as the I.R.S. is concerned, yes, I'm dead. <br><br>If I told you that, I'd have to kill me. <br><br>Maybe&#8230; ex-girlfriends might have opinions on this&#8230; <br><br>Pie is always good, never bad. <br><br>The Reaver won't work against me, but only because I run away very fast. <br><br>DrooId wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I read this and got a little chuckle out of it because while hunting in Velketor's Lab the other night a Drake Skull Helm dropped. 20AC, 4wis, 4int, 20 mana, WAR/CLR/PAL/SHD/BRD wearable. A nice item for a cleric who is maxed on wis already except for 1 thing, 25.0 wt. Someone in the group commented, "have you noticed something about the loot we get lately?". Of course someone had some smart ass comment but the person who asked the question said, "No, not that, it's that a lot of the gear we have been getting has nice stats, EXCEPT for 1 which goes and messes things up." Personally I like this. It makes people consider the benefits of using items with extra nice stats but some penalties. The helm wound up going to our warrior because although it looked awesome on our high elf cleric, she has no way to buff her own strength and would be constantly encumbered. Good job on making things not so cut and dry. I like it. ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks.<br><br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000283.html"><b>Planets</b></a><br>Niqlamor-Pandore-MT wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I tried casting the spell "Defoliation" on "a feral amalgame" in Plane of Growth, and got the message: <br><br>This spell only works on the plants. <br><br>I'm puzzled. Looks like a bug. It HAS to be a plant. It's a flower, with foliage, it appears to have roots, and leaves. It can't not be. ]</i></font><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Actually the Denizens of the Plane of Growth are considered to be Extra Planar creatures, which makes them unlike the normal plants that those spells work on. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Aye, and they also are under the direct protection of the Mother of All, as well as the magical properties of the Plane of Growth itself.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000284.html"><b>Celestial Healing and Posion</b></a><br>Concino wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello,<br> <br>I've noticed last night at Dreadlands that I cannot celestial heal a person if he is poisoned.

From Cebu:<BLOCKQUOTE> I just wanted to let you guys know about a site that my friends and I have put up recently. Currently, the focus of the site revolves around a Java application that we have written for EQ. It is called GroupMaker. As the name suggests, the program is used for organizing groups for planes and dragons. Right now it is still in its infant stages, but soon we hope to have such features as autogrouping (automatically groups everyone listed for your raid based on a raid template), macro support, and the ability to keep up with the status of the groups during the raid (this would require using a second machine on your network). I am pretty excited about this program, and I hope people recognize the time - saving potential that it has.

Alan visited the Developer's Corner and added several new updates to it today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000281.html"><b>Resistance Bug on Sullon Zek</b></a><br>Yup, there is indeed a bug with the way the changes to PvP resistances on Sullon Zek are working right now. We've narrowed the problem down and hope to have it fixed early next week. <br><br>Thanks to those that sent us detailed examples of the problem.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000280.html"><b>Ogre and Troll Guards in Neriak</b></a><br>Anonymous wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Something that really cheapens EverQuest for me is seeing players hunting "safe" camps in cities. Ogguk before the wolf form changes for example. It really removes the role playing feel when you can fight in the middle of a town and no one notices. It's not that I object to raiding cities, it's the risk free camps in cities. <br><br>The latest is the Troll and Ogre guards in Neriak. Apparently the faction hit isn't anything to worry about (maybe there isn't one, maybe a little red wine fixes it), and the DE guards won't assist them. As a result people are constantly killing Trolls and Ogres right in front of the DE guards. <br><br>I can't imagine a city where the guards would allow this to happen, but then I can't imagine a player who'd thing this was fun. <br><br>If you do decide to respond to this could make me anonymous, I'm sure there are those who would blame me for "ruining" the game. ]</i></font><br><br>I can imagine it pretty easily&#8230; <br><br>Guard Bl' Amo says: Hey, look over there. Another one of those ridiculous Ogre guards is taking a beating. <br><br>Guard Sm' Asho laughs. <br><br>Guard Sm' Asho says: That's pretty funny. But it does upset me just a bit. <br><br>Guard Bl' Amo says: Why is that? <br><br>Guard Sm' Asho says: I was thinking of killing that one myself. He's been a little uppity lately, thinking that he actually has some sort of <i>right</i> to be here. <br><br>Dark Elves don't much like Ogres or Trolls. They tolerate them because they have been ordered to do so, not because they think they make good company. <br><br>And calling it 'safe' is a bit off. The Ogre guards aren't exactly pushovers.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000277.html"><b>Invoke Death</b></a><br>I was just about to make this response: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: absor that isn't true, the 55 hitting pet is now coning even to a 39 and it used to be lvl 41. <br><br>please look into it. <br><br>Abillister "Monkey" Abu ]</i></font><br><br>All of my data tells me that this pet always has maxed out at 39th level. <br><br>I'll keep looking into this, however. <br><br>Alan <br><br>But as I was about to post it, we discovered what had happened. It's kind of hard to explain, but we'll try. <br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>All the Pet NPCs are named a certain way which reflects their level. Last week I was cataloguing the sats of the pets in game and I guess I accidentally edited the wrong NPC, when I went to set it back I set it's level to the level indicated in it's name. At some point in the past the level of the 49 necro pet was changed to be higher than the one listed in its name. This caused the max level of the pet as well as its average level to be lowered by 2. I have corrected the mistake I made in the pet's level, and we will be updating this on the servers this afternoon. The update will not require the servers to come down. I'm really sorry for this mistake, and hope I haven't inconvenienced anyone too much. Thanks to everyone who reported my error so quickly. <br><br>Take care <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Let me give a fake example. I'm oversimplifying this to help make it clear. <br><br>Let's say there was a pet named Bob4. That name would indicate that he was of the type Bob and is intended to be level 4. <br><br>At some point in the past it was decided that Bob needed to be 6th level. Because the name Bob4 is referenced in a lot of other places in the game, changing the name might not be the best idea, so someone just raised Bob4 to level 6. <br><br>When Lawrence noticed the error he'd made by accidentally editing Bob4, he went back to make Bob4 4th level, as his name indicated. <br><br>From looking at the data there wasn't an easy way to know that Bob4 should have been 6th level. <br><br>But when we delved into it and tapped into Gordon's impressive database talent we were able to look and see that prior to Lawrence's revision, Bob4 had indeed been 6th level. <br><br>Again, we're sorry for the error. And thanks for pointing it out.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000278.html"><b>Sullon Zek</b></a><br>SnowShadower wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm still looking (so I may have missed it) but to have a place where ALL Sullon Zek rules are posted would be a good thing.

Things picked up for a change on the Developer's Corner today.  Here's the latest from Alan VanCouvering:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000276.html"><b>Faction Cap Messages</b></a><br>At this time faction cap messages are broken.

My first thought, of course, was that the person wanted a port (im a druid) - I am normally more than happy to port people, but I was well into making heady kiola's and really didn't want to break my rythym (I needed 320 of the damn things :)) - if you have ever done much trade skill stuff, you will know what I mean. My usual good nature won out though (heh :)), so I turned around, ready to do a port. <br><br>Standing in front of me was a naked level 1 halfling warrior. My next thought, of course, was "damn beggars". I didn't say that though, and asked this person what I could do for him. <br><br>"Where do I go to kill things?", he asked. I was a bit shocked, I'll admit - it's not the sort of question I get asked alot these days. <br><br>"Misty Thicket is where you should be hunting, as a level 1 halfling", I replied. <br><br>"How do I get there? And are there dragons there?" <br><br>After explaining to him that no, there were in fact no dragons in Misty Thicket ("says dragons on the box") and SoWed him and said "Follow me, friend". When we got to the Misty Thicket zone, he mentions "I just bought the game." Instantly, I go into massive help mode - I have a huge soft spot for true "newbies" to Everquest (not your beggar types, but your real, "hey-what's-this-game" type newbies). True to form for most computer game players (myself included :)), he hadn't read the manual, so over the next 2 hours or so, I explained to him the very basics of the game (how to attack, how to set up hotkeys, /loc, how to get his newbie tunic, how to train skills, etc, etc) and then took him out to Misty Thicket, threw a few buffs on him (no damage shield though :)), and helped him get to level 2. He may have only been killing what most of us regard as newbie "yard-trash", but he was *loving* it. <br><br>"I'm the man! I'm the bat, wolf, rat and bixie killing man!" he declared at one point :). <br><br>As I helped him, and answered his questions, it occurred to me, for the first time in a very long time, that EverQuest is a bloody hard game to get started in. <br><br>I have been playing for almost two years now, and have spent 18 months playing Sorran and over that time have learnt so much about the game, that I almost take that knowledge for granted. Answering this newbie's questions really slammed home how *vast* this world of Norrath is. I took pause and sent a silent /salute to Verant for this extraordinary creation. Many of us may question many of their decisions, but the fact remains, regardless of your specific complaints or concerns, there exists a truly magical world at the heart of it all. It is breath-taking in its scope and granduer - once in a while, take the time out from your xp camps or raids to "smell the roses". I got a chance to look at Norrath through the eyes of a newbie last night, and it blew me away all over again. <br><br>Most of us can never again experience that true moment of newbie-wonder, not even in another game. We know too much about MMORPGs work now - no matter the game, we expect there to be a "newbie" period, we know there will be "spolier" sites to get info from, we know there will be certain classes/skills/items that will be better than others, we expect hackers/cheaters/scammers, and so on. The creatures, the game mechanics, the environment may all be totally different from game to game but, at their core, they are all the same - they are all MMORPGs. For those of us already playing them, we can never again be a true newbie. <br><br>For me, Everquest is my first MMORPG - I clearly remember my wonder as I ventured beyond North Qeynos for the first time and into the Hills of Qeynos - I was awestruck at this *huge* zone (hah! :)), amazed at the sunsets behind the hills, terrified of following the road deeper into the Hills. I can still appreciate the visual splendour of the world of Norrath, but I am far more jaded player than I was 2 years ago. <br><br>I am a level 60 druid, wearing nice gear, proudly wielding my epic weapon, and lucky enough to be in a great guild that is currently exploring the "end-game" of Everquest as it stands at the moment (North wing of the Temple of veeshan, Sleeper's Tomb). I have a lot of fun, and get to fight some pretty nasty creatures. But you know what? For two hours last night, I envied that level 1 halfing warrior, taking his very first steps into Norrath. I mourned for the loss of my MMORPG "innocence". <br><br>So again, /salute to Verant for letting us all into Norrath (and /bonk for the silly decisions of course :)). <br><br>And /salute to that halfing warrior who let me share in his first steps into Norrath - you may have thanked me for my help, but I am far more indebted to you than you can imagine. <br><br>Cheers, <br><br>Sorran<br>Heirophant of the Vagrants<br>Tribunal Server<br>World of Norrath. <br><br>P.S. Maybe other's could send in their "newbie-wonder" moments here? :)]</i></font><br><br>Nicely done. <br><br>I remember a few moments like that. There's a certain awe in being there when someone gets to experience things for the first time. It's always a blast to help out a truly new player. I encourage you all to give it a try. :)<br><br>Rather than starting up a thread here about "newbie-wonder" moments, how about doing in on the Newbie Zone? I think this would be a good topic for that board. <br><br>I posted it here mostly because you reminded me that some of the best times I've had in game were showing people how to play.

Scribes are lining up even now so that they may take your application to become a Guide of Norrath.<br> <br>We are seeking those strong in character, bright in wit, soft with compassion, and filled with joy.<br> <br>If you've ever felt good helping a fellow adventurer retrieve his corpse, or with helping someone when they felt all was lost, then this is truly the adventure for you.  Or perhaps you feel your sense of humor could bring smiles to the faces of Norrathian citizens.  Maybe your renowned acting skills might be of help.  If you are kind, compassionate, and helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.<br> <br>If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be difficult at times.  You can be assured that you will be tried...  and hopefully you will be found true.  In the end though, the citizens of Norrath will benefit from your thoughtful participation, and the lands of Norrath will continue to become a better place.<br> <br>If you feel this is something you must be a part of, then I invite you to point your browser to: <a href="http://guideapp.everquest.com">http://guideapp.everquest.com</a><br> <br>We ask so little of your time, but the benefits you can bring to Norrath are grand.<br> <br>A few things to remember:<br>1) You must have an active EverQuest account in good standing.<br>2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.<br>3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.<br>4) You will need good communication skills.<br>5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.<br>6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must.<br> <br>Come one, come all... help us to make the lands of Norrath better than they already are... come be a part of the EverQuest Guide Program!<br> <br> - The EverQuest Guide Program<br> <br><br>August 15th, 3:00 am  <br>------------------------------<br> <br>**  Spell Changes **<br> <br>- Celestial Tranquility and Call of Earth will now stack<br>- Some stacking issues with Torpor have been corrected.<br>- Celestial Cleansing will fizzle less now<br>- Cannibalize should fizzle slightly less often now<br> <br><br>** Zone Changes **<br> <br>- Updated some pathing in Runnyeye, Paineel, Siren's Grotto and Kedge.<br>- The Drowned Citizens are back, for sure this time.<br>- Fixed a bug that was not allowing some NPCs in Kael to see invisible creatures as they should.<br>- Restored "charmability" of most NPCs (merchants will remain uncharmable) in Kael due to fix of combat AI bug listed bellow under **  Miscellaneous Changes **.<br> <br><br>** Item Changes **<br> <br>- The Giant Tree Flayer is now Large instead of Tiny.<br>- Staff of Temperate Flux has been changed to main hand only.<br>- Ring of Frost Spiders can now be worn.<br>- Robe of the Seacaller should now be equipable.<br> <br><br>** Trade Skill Changes **<br> <br>- Imbued Field Plate Boots should be working properly now.<br> <br><br>** Sullon Zek Changes **<br> <br>- Changed the way resists are calculated when a Player Character casts a spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek.

At the same time giving lower level characters a slightly better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level characters.<br>- Characters below 6th level cannot be pick pocketed in any zone.<br>- Guards have a better chance of aggro'ing a rogue that fails at picking pockets near guards.<br> <br><br>**  Miscellaneous Changes **<br> <br>- Fixed a recently introduced combat AI bug that caused NPCs to focus unduly on attacking pets rather than PCs<br>- Added a few crowns to the list of items that can be traded in for new crowns with new textures.

Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their hometowns.<br> <br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Special thanks goes ot Fennin Ro's Runelaron for sending me this copy of the patch message.
