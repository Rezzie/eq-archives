As many of you know, Gordon posted a few thoughts this evening on the idea of "Premium Servers."  After receiving a tip from Dariarn I quickly entered EQ to discover a new in-game poll asking and I quote:<BLOCKQUOTE><I><b>Would you pay $49.95 for a private server that offered premium customer service?</b></I></BLOCKQUOTE>For those who haven't yet read Gordon's thoughts on this I have included the following quote:<UL><i>Anyway, we're just crunching some numbers based on multiple requests along those lines that have been posted here on the boards and sent through email. We haven't yet defined what exactly "Premium CS" means, but if the idea looks promising, we'd certainly define it before launching any servers of this type. Just as a note, the existence of any premium servers would not detract from the service provided on the standard servers. <br><br>I also noticed that many people are getting hung up on the concept of "premium". If you look at service industries, you'll see many that offer premium service of one kind or another. You can check out the standard vs. premium pricing tiers at many technology companies out there. This is not something unusual in the technology industry, just a new concept for online games.</I></UL>It's an interesting idea, no question about it, but on the other hand some would argue that this would be what people are paying for in the first place.    <br><br>I have created a new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=6944803&start=6944803#6944803"><b>Player View Discussion Thread</b></a> for everyone to share their thoughts and opinions about this sudden possibility.

One of the most philosophical questions one can ask, at least in Norrath, was raised by Gordon Wrinn in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016495.html">following thread</a>:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>I noticed a number of people here talking about the way that creatures decide to flee, referring to a change that went in with the last patch. After speaking with the programmer responsible for AI among other things, it's apparent that there was a change made while optimizing code that caused an "unintended fix" to the AI. Though no one sat down and said, "I'm going to make creatures flee more", that's the result.<br><br>Without going too far into specifics and formulae regarding the decision to flee, there are several "components" that NPCs use to determine how brave they are. One of the common ones that everyone knows about is the interrelation of hitpoints and level with the attacker. One of the other less-known components was using some uninitialized memory (memory space allocated to a variable that hasn't yet been 'set' to anything, and usually contains garbage) that had the effect of making NPCs much more brave than they should have been.<br><br>We are going to discuss this in the tuning meeting Monday, but my initial impression is that the AI is now working as it should, and I like how things are turning out so far.<br><br>What are your thoughts?<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

This is the evening edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016566.html"><b>Premium Server Thread </b></a><br>I just noticed that we need to consolidate these now :)<br><br>Anyway, we're just crunching some numbers based on multiple requests along those lines that have been posted here on the boards and sent through email. We haven't yet defined what exactly "Premium CS" means, but if the idea looks promising, we'd certainly define it before launching any servers of this type.

I personally dislike drives to remove consequences for mistakes, as it removes the incentive to avoid making them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016386.html"><b>Verant Email Addressses</b></a><br>Actually George Scotto can be reached at gscotto@verant.com or gscotto@station.sony.com. All personal email addresses follow the "First initial, last name" format, and are either at station.sony.com or verant.com. In many cases, both will work. <br><br>I should stress that everyone out there with their name in the public light gets a ton of email, so individual responses are not always possible. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016385.html"><b>AFK</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: However, I ask that setting AFK would reflect not only on the /who list, but be visible on the player's name. ]</i></font><br><br>The next patch will append "AFK" and/or "LD" to names as the status indicates. I disagree that this is really much of an issue on the PvP servers to be concerned with, as it's already available in the /who list. <br><br>There's no reliable way to seek out LD people<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013215-2.html"><b>Crimson Robe of Alendine </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is it possible to get the appearance of the Crimson Robe of Alendine changed? I have had this robe for some time now and have always been very dissapointed in the fact that it looks exactly like an easily obtainable and very common mid level Magician quest robe.]</i></font> <br><br>No plans to do this. We've already made the mistake of making the lower level magician robe use the same graphic, but going back and revisiting the "look" of existing items keeps the team from moving forward in other areas. We've committed, going forward, that lower level items will not be assigned the same look as higher level ones to avoid the problem in the future. <br><br>It's not so much the time that it would take to make one change, but that associated with going back and revisiting these issues in general. I hope that you understand.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016010.html"><b>Resist Rates Changed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Resist rates changed again.]</i></font> <br><br>No, they were not. <br><br>Resists, fizzle rates, duration of invisibility, duration of frequently used buffs, and a few other things frequently spawn "post-patch anecdotes" about some sort of change. <br><br>Bad rolls, or a series of bad rolls are always possible, and do not indicate a change. There are a *number* of people out there who scientifically analyze everything in the game, and had any of this stuff actually changed, you'd see them all here bringing it up.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014419.html"><b>Mages</b></a><br>I'll be honest with you by telling you that there's no "drive" to improve the mage class as we don't see it as being necessary for their health. Mages are very apt within the game, and while every class can come up with ideas that really wouldn't hurt anything, we're focusing on putting in new content for a broader array of gamers. <br><br>I did however want to comment on the "Tornado" idea. I don't think something like that would be appropriate for the magician class. Were we to decide to put something presented in that manner in, it would probably go to druids, being a weather oriented event.</UL>

Gordon Wrinn again addressed the recent UI changes in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016231.html">following thread</a> he started on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>By now you've noticed some UI changes that were put in yesterday in preparation for some more robust changes that are planned. In light of the positive comments and the number of people anticipating some further enchancements, we'll have some new things for next week's patch.<br><br>In HUD mode, all boxes (target, group, chat, hotboxes, spell icons, etc) will become movable. You will be able to place them anywhere on the screen that you wish and their position will be recorded in the EQCLIENT.INI file. Furthermore, the "Spell Effects" box will also be resizable, to choices of 3x5 (current), 2x8, or 1x15. <br><br>Finally, the Chat window will also be resizable. Resizing horizontally will cause more text to be displayed per line. While resizing vertically will still only display a maximum of 10 lines, the spacing between the lines will be dynamically adjusted. I know that many people felt the font size changed in this patch, but really only the spacing between lines was reduced at higher resolutions.

Gordon made <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016303.html">an announcement</a> regarding the new Fiery Avenger-style quests on the Gameplay Board late, late last night:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>I've noticed a number of questions popping up in regards to the class epic quests implemented in the last patch, with concerns of them being broken in one way or another. <br><br>I just wanted to stop by and let everyone know that we've had a team of testers working on the quests, along with the game designers who implemented them, for the past two weeks non-stop. All quests have not only been confirmed as working, but have been confirmed with every race/class/deity combination available. We wanted to be absolutely sure that there were no problems in implementation and that players were not left wondering what is going on.<br><br>Given this, the GMs and Guides in game will not answer any questions in regards to these quests or components of these quests, other than to say that the quest is working. Furthermore, the specifics regarding every quest are known only by the designers and the Test team. The GMs and Guides have no way to look up any information that might be requested to address them in a more in-depth manner. It is essential that the Designers and Test team maintain absolute secrecy in regards to these quests in order to preserve the mystery for those who endeavor to discover and solve these quests on their own.<br><br>I will tell you this: These quests are different from any other quest implemented in EverQuest thus far. The designer of each quest spent in excess of a month on each design, several weeks on implementation, with a final few weeks of testing. <br><br>I wish you all well on your quests.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Gordon hit the boards hard tonight and posted the following messages to the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016206.html"><b>UI Enhancements</b></a><br>Part of the included enhancements to the UI is that bags can be opened when in the HUD mode. For instance, if you were to a general inventory slot in a hotbox, you can open a bag now without shifting modes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016212.html"><b>Shrink</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So I was wondering, why is this spell dungeon only?]</i></font> <br><br>Because we didn't want people running around shrunk as a matter of course, but rather wanted the spell to be used when it's use was necessary. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The size problem is taken care of in dungeons by using the Shaman Shrink spell or Shrink potions. But you cannot cast this spell while outdoors.]</i></font> <br><br>The shrink potion will work outdoors for situations that you've mentioned above.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016218.html"><b>FAQ Suggestion</b></a><br>I imagine that people can search out a few keywords and go to the appropriate section. That said, I'll see if I can give a few more directions in the future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016222.html"><b>Ducking Out of Combat</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But why does it tell you that you have ducked out of combat when you haven't done a thing? I'd rather get a message saying "The beast has your scent." ]</i></font><br><br>You are never invisible to a creature that has you on its hate-list. Hiding while in combat merely activates the "Evade" function, which will reduce your hate value, but never remove you from the list. The creature will still be mad at you, but the point is for him to be more mad at someone else in your group. It's like a reverse-taunt. <br><br>The message you get just tells you whether or not you've successfully "evaded".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016202.html"><b>Emote Output</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: % or @, no matter to me, but please... <br>Can you make it so it works in ALL forms of output?<br>/say,/em,/gu,/gsay,/shout,/ooc,/auction (no reason for auction but completeness is nice ) ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, that is indeed our plan for implementation of the %-codes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016205.html"><b>Kiting Nerf</b></a><br>Some NPCs flee when they get low on health. It sounds like this is what is happening here. I'm not sure if these *particular* NPCs fled previously, but your observations indicate that they do now.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016187.html"><b>Rancor's Faction</b></a><br>He should indeed be back on beta neutral faction.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016170.html"><b>Unable to Patch</b></a><br>I don't think that there's an excessive number of people connecting to the patch server currently. I'd have to chalk it up to an ISP or local system problem. Have you tried removing and reinstalling your TCP/IP protocol? I received an email from a customer the other day who said that this fixed a similar problem.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016184.html"><b>Gordon and His Email</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does Gordon answer his email?]</i></font> <br><br>Some of it, but I spend the vast majority of my time here on the boards, as individual emails are not a good way to reach a lot of people. <br><br>I typically go through mail to see if there's anything there that I asked someone to send me, forward a bunch of mail off to customer service, and answer a small number that are sufficiently concise.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016186.html"><b>Indecent Kunark Prices</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: $72,45 ($16.95 upgrade + $55.50 shipping).<br>It's about $30 more than purchasing the full retail box (Everquest + RoK) here in Sweden.]</i></font> <br><br>If the cost of the upgrade+shipping is more than the full box, I would definitely recommend that you purchase the full box and use it as an upgrade. We've little control over the price that our distributor charges for shipping.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016167.html"><b>Cool Upcoming UI Improvements</b></a><br>As it turns out, we'll very soon (probably in next weeks patch) opening up the ability to move the boxes where you please. We'll also be allowing you to resize the buff box (3x5, 2x8, or 1x15). <br><br>As for the order that the boxes are filled, it's the same as it was before in relation to direction.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016127.html"><b>Kiting Banable?</b></a><br>Kiting, whether it is done with snare, DDs, DOTs, or AEs, forward or reverse, is not an exploit and is currently acceptable. I would however caution those kiting to avoid accidently training people while doing it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016137.html"><b>Mark of Karn, Part 2</b></a><br>I just noticed that the last thread was closed as it was fast approaching the point at which threads become unstable, so I thought I'd begin a new one. <br><br>In response to the posts thus far, we are going to discuss the issue again on Monday at the tuning meeting. The general consensus here in the office is that we may have overreacted with the change, and not fully accomplished our goal. We'll keep you posted come then.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016119.html"><b>SoW Bugged?</b></a><br>There have been no changes to SoW speed, and this is the first I've heard of the problem that you mention. I also mentioned it to Rowyl and he hasn't heard of it either. It sounds as if you may have been crouching inadvertently. I've done that by accident before.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016051.html"><b>Monks and Weapons</b></a><br>Nothing is saying that lower level monks can't wield the new weapons, just that if they do, they'll take a penalty to their defensive abilities. <br><br>To answer the original poster's question as to why 55 and 60, and not some other level: We had to make some decision, and decided that raise it at a lower weight wasn't appropriate given the items that exist in the game. I should mention that it is not intended that monks should be able to don all of the best gear and remain under the cap. They need to decide if the downside is worth the upside for the particular encounter.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/016105.html"><b>Haste</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does that mean that the Mith 2 Hander (21dmg/40dly effect: Haste) has had it's damage bonus increased? Or does it count the sword as being a 21dmg/30 something dly weapon because of the haste. A bonus would be great for this weapon, once again making it the superior blade that it sould be]</i></font> <br><br>It's based off the base-damage of the weapon, not the hasted-damage. In other words, if your weapons lists 40 delay as the delay, you get the additional bonus regardless of which haste items if any you are wearing.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015968.html"><b>Epic Quest Weapons for Lower Level Characters?</b></a><br>Weapons with particle effects are probably too resource intensive to implement on a wide scale in game. The nice thing about the eqic quest rewards is that they aren't something that *everyone* is going to have, so we can do something a little bit more special and out of the ordinary for them. The soulfire's particle effects were more of an experiment on implementing weapons of that type on a wider scale in game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015906.html"><b>Limited To 15 Buffs</b></a><br>The 15 buff limit has always been there, and is a core part of how the adventure system works in EverQuest. As more and more buffs are available, people must begin making strategic choices as to what buffs they feel they should have up. <br><br>This adds more strategy than just allowing everyone to throw up every buff that will stack.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015910.html"><b>Wurmslayer Nerfed</b></a><br>I apologize for not announcing this. The change apparently took place between last Friday and the patch yesterday. The "range" value on the weapon was set by mistake and was fixed by the game designers. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015917.html"><b>Balance In All Things</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Where am I going with this? Glad you asked.<br><br>I REJECT the theory that all classes are balanced. If they were all classes would be capable of handling a similar environment with equal ease or difficulty. This is not the case. ]</i></font><br><br>This comes back to the balance versus equality debate. Were the goal for the classes to be that they be equal, I'd agree with your statement, however the goal is balance. Balance is about complementary strengths and weaknesses. It's about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Take a look at the FAQ at <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html</a> for extended discourse on the subject.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015955.html"><b>3 Questions for Gordon</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. what is the status of the monster warping (aka ghosting) bug?]</i></font> <br><br>Some degree of warping will always be present due to the way that network latency is handled in the game. Those with high pings or packet-loss are far more likely to experience it than others. Some warping is usually preferable to having your movement constantly checked and updated by latency. <br><br>All warping is caused by a disagreement between the client and the server as to where the creature in question actually is. Information in a radius around the player is updated more frequently than that beyond the radius. Prediction is used to account for expected movements during the periods between updates. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. is it intended that draught of fire and volcanic draught have same mana usage, same casting time, same damage although one spell is level 51 and the other 54? from a couple of hours playing i also didnt see any difference in resistances.]</i></font> <br><br>The factors that you mention are intended. The second spell, Voltaic Draught, saves versus a different resistance than Draught of Fire. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. why do AE spell effect sometimes show and sometimes not?]</i></font> <br><br>Do you mean that the icon doesn't show on the UI, or that the particles don't show on the screen?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015654.html"><b>Tallon Zek Bannings</b></a><br>I apologize for the lack of consistency in regards to this issue. It's being addressed.</UL>

Spells have mana as a control mechanism that controls how much damage someone can do. Archery has no such control mechanism. Perhaps if we had included another "resource pool" of sorts, or tied it to stamina and reduced stamina regen, we could have done it, but we decided that spells would be the only primary form of ranged attack in the game. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012792.html"><b>Druid Spell Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: To me this one simple thing.

Without this damage bonus, all weapons of equivalent ratio do the same damage over time. That means that a 20/40, a 10/20, and a 5/10 weapon would all do the same damage. <br><br>Now lets factor in the damage bonus. If someone was using the 20/40 weapon, the damage bonus would be applied ONCE in a 4 second period. If they were using the 10/20 weapon, it would be applied TWICE in the same period. With the 5/10 weapon it would be applied FOUR times in that same 4 second period. <br><br>It was this damage bonus which makes weapons that are very fast for their type better than those that are slower. The change we implemented merely flattened out the damage curve a bit.</UL>

Gordon Wrinn visited the Gameplay Board a couple more times this evening.  Here's the round-up:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015570.html"><b>Online Store</b></a><br>I'd have to consider this a "major enhancement" patch rather than a nerf patch. Fact is that any patch that has anything in it that could be construed by anyone to be negative is called a "nerf patch" despite the overwelming number of globally positive things that are included. It's our curse and we'll live with it. <br><br>That said, there was no "timing" to the reopening of the online store. We opened it when it was ready, no sooner or later. If it would have been ready on Monday it would have been opened then. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015589.html"><b>More on 2H Weapon Issue</b></a><br>This wasn't aimed at any particular class issue. It was lessening the difference between high-delay and low-delay weapons of the same ratio. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015737.html"><b>Verant Loves Power Gamers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How is it that Verant can do this every time? They put loot in the game just long enough for people that play 24 hours a day can scoop it all up. Then they turn around and either stop it from dropping or they move it to another much harder zone? ]</i></font><br><br>While I disagree that this happens "every time", we often only find out that a problem exists due to people "scooping up" loot in question. A problem must be encountered before it can be addressed. <br><br>This typically only happens when we implement massive content additions for the people who play the game. Though we will continue to take steps to reduce the amount that this happens, it can be said with some certainty that we'll make mistakes from time to time. <br><br>Consider how many new items went in for Kunark, and then compare that to the number later found to be problematic. It's a fairly small percentage.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015383.html"><b>New Servers</b></a><br>All of the information that can be released in regards to the new servers has been released. I realize that everyone wants to have more information, but it isn't realistic to release it at this time. Alazor's answer is a very good description of the issues at hand.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015536.html"><b>Bug?</b></a><br>Please check it today and let me know here how it's working. The last patch caused a small subset of people to crash while in game. We have fixed the problem in this patch. Providing that your crash was due to the same problem as others, it should be working again today.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015543.html"><b>2H Damage Weapons Changed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If a faster weapon is shown to be superior why is their any need for change?]</i></font> <br><br>Because it was too far out of whack. Weapons of a given ratio should generally do a similar amount of damage. Faster weapons already get an inherent advantage with the way minimum damage works, so this was an appropriate change to keep them in line. <br><br>We'd rather not see everyone choosing the absolute fastest weapon and then throw something like the Fiery Avenger aside due to the delay.</UL>

The following are the latest posts from Verant's Gordon Wrinn:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015248.html"><b>Bad CS?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So what this tells me is No we cant explain it, yes you have five witnesses, it was a bug or an intentional train by someone but we wont help you. ]</i></font><br><br>Addressing your concerns in reverse, even if it was a train, intentional or otherwise, the GMs don't give people resurrections. Intentional training is not tolerated, but if it happens, the experience loss is a part of it. <br><br>As for it being a bug, it's not that simple. Unanticipated things can happen in EverQuest. This is designed as part of the game. Nothing should be such a sure thing that it can be quantified with absolute certainty. Most likely, these guys were pulled out by someone else, and weren't back at their spawn points when you pulled the other creatures. <br><br>You had some unexpected nasties come up after you. I would bet that it got your heart racing :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So that tells me that you either assume Im lying or dont care. I think the majority of verant care, so that leaves me with you assume im a liar. That is REALLy infuriating ]</i></font><br><br>I don't think that its fair to say that the GM thought *you* were lying, however I would ask you to understand that it is very easy for someone to get 4 friends to back them up on something. With little real consequences to dishonesty if it cannot be caught, there is little to keep people honest. As a result, we have to treat everything on a global scale. <br><br>The GMs are now banning people outright when it is absolutely known that they are lying. However, even though this is fairly well-known and leading to many people being banned every day, people keep trying to get by on these issues. <br><br>In an ideal world, no one would try to get one by on the GM, and then the GMs would be able to hand out resurrections whenever they are petitioned. I really wish we could do that and maintain the integrity of the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015238.html"><b>Knowing Your Game</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: hey gordon know your own game before you post]</i></font> <br><br>What do you mean? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: [Clerics are] also the only wis caster without ...see-invis...<br>rangers don't get see-invis]</i></font> <br><br>Is your problem with these two statements? <br><br>Rangers cast, but aren't "casters" in generally accepted vernacular.

I was about to reply suggesting that you refresh your cache, but I'm happy I took a look before I did :)  Apparently the file was updated with a version from back in May. I've forwarded the issue to our WebOps group. I apologize for the problem. <br><br>To answer your question, yes there is a patch going in today at 7:00am PDT (GMT-7).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015216.html"><b>A Suggestion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just an idea here, since there are players in house that play each class, and every class is balanced, then has there been any thoughts of having them post here?]</i></font> <br><br>We need to speak with a unified voice to maintain our focus. Not everyone who plays every class necessarily has full view of the big picture. There's also the point that these others have jobs that they do, and they need to get their work done. Finally, I'd prefer to see the focus of the board drift away from class-issues. Being honest, these are situations that can often only be made worse through extended discourse. Anyone who has taken the time to build friendships can get groups if they've fostered the required friendships, and can contribute to those groups. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Or having them set up a page where everyone can go to and read comments on the class, its strengths, its weaknesses, strategies, and other class specific things such as quests etc??]</i></font> <br><br>There's already several websites out there that specialize in information of this type without making it part of an official information release. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015234.html"><b>Procs</b></a><br>At this time there are no weapons which proc more or less than any other. There was at one time a change made to the mistwalker to make it proc less, but that was later removed in favor of another change. <br><br>The proc rates are a percentage chance modified by dexterity, the type of weapon (1H vs 2H), and the delay rating on the weapon.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015237.html"><b>New Kunark Zone?</b></a><br>It's a possible future expansion.

Couldn't something be done about this?]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry, but we really don't want to increase the maximum amount of storage space required by each account. Remember that any change is exponential. It's not one character that gets more storage space, it's 8 characters by 34 servers by nearly 300K subscribers. It's a fairly large amount of data on that scale.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015196.html"><b>Haste</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Changing the way haste stacking works, at this point in the game's life will have a HUGE impact on class balance.]</i></font> <br><br>I disagree, fixing the bug pretty much affects everyone equally, and actually benefits people in many cases. I imagine that most were unaware of the bug and were buffing with maximum haste anyway. Now they can be secure in their spells meaning something. Not to mention, we can now look forward to the value of the different haste items being appropriate as well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015215.html"><b>More on FBSS Nerf Issue</b></a><br>Thanks Suron1x, that's an accurate description of the issue. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think it's bad that the entire game was balanced by playtesters who were all at the haste cap, a situation that is now no longer going to be common]</i></font> <br><br>You may have a point, but its not an absolute. Not everyone has both haste items and haste spells available, and those are the only ones who stand to be negatively affected by this change. Chances are, if you already have a high-level haste item, and have access to a haste spell as well, the cap is still very attainable. It just can't be done with the lowest level item haste and spell-haste available.<br> <br>I am quite happy that we were finally able to track down the cause of everyone's complaints regarding one haste item being no better than another.</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Today's gigantic Patch Message is now being displayed on the Patch Server:<UL>September 19th, 7:00am<br>------------------------<br> <br><b>*Level 1 Character Purge*</b><br> <br>The Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take place on Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7).  Any level 1 characters that haven't been played within the previous 30 days will be deleted.  If you wish to keep any level 1 characters that you may have, please log in and play them between now and 9/27.  <br> <br><br><b>***Patch Day***</b><br> <br>As a testament to our on-going goal to constantly provide more content for EverQuest players, today's patch primarily consists of *many* content-additions to the game.  <br> <br><b>*New Epic Quests*</b><br> <br>We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new "Fiery Avenger" style quests for every class in the game (including paladins).  The ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model with unique particle effects. We think that you will be pleased.<br> <br>Good luck to everyone on your quest.<br> <br><b>*Class Issues*</b><br> <br>Rangers:<br> <br>Last week we completed in-depth testing of melee and defensive skills for all melee-centric classes.  In the course of these tests we determined that the ranger class was not performing to its intended level, and have made the following changes:<br> <br>- The "Jolt" spell has had its casting time reduced.<br>- The Skillcap on Dodge and Parry has been increased.<br> <br>Monks:<br> <br>High-level monks can now carry increased weight without penalty.  The additional allowance is granted at levels 55 and 60.<br> <br>Cleric:<br> <br>Celestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that are incompatible with that configuration.  We have therefore removed the cure components and increased the healing provided by this spell.<br> <br>After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell's current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its "heal per hit" value decreased.  <br> <br><br><b>*Fungal Regrowth*</b><br> <br>"Fungal Regrowth" is now a self-only spell.  It was being used as an offensive spell by virtue of its "snare" effect upon the target.  Furthermore, we ruled out making it "group only" as with other spells that have this issue, due to a class-balance concern.  The spell was reducing the group's desire for classes capable of casting regenerative magic.<br> <br><br><b>*Attack Speed Buffs*</b><br> <br>In this patch we corrected a bug that would cause any "Haste" item combined with any "Haste" spell to automatically yield maximum haste, regardless of the level of "Haste" granted by each individual component.  This fix increases the usefulness of better "Haste" equipment and spells.  The downside to this is that those who usually have both items and spells active will see a reduced attack-speed unless outfitted with the best equipment and spells.<br> <br><br><b>*High-Level Dungeon Balancing*</b><br> <br>Veehshan's Peak and Sebilis have received loot adjustments in order to address disparities in risk and reward.  For the most part, the quality of the "common" loot in Veeshan's Peak is at least as good as the "rares" from Sebilis.<br> <br><br><b>*Low-Delay Weapons and Damage Bonus Changes*</b><br> <br>In accordance with our announcement several weeks ago, two low-delay weapons can now only be equipped in the off-hand.  Included in this change are the Mosscovered Twig and the Barbed Scale Whip.  The delay on these weapons and the associated damage bonus to weapons in the primary hand made these weapons much too powerful for their availability and the risk associated with their acquisition.<br> <br>In addition, two-handed weapons have had their damage-bonus modified.  The damage-bonus for low-delay two-handed weapons (27 or below) created a problem similar to the weapons above and has been reduced. The damage-bonus has not changed for normal-delay (28-39) two-handed weapons. The damage bonus for high-delay two-handed weapons (40+) has been increased.<br> <br><br><b>*Server Selection Screen*</b><br> <br>It has come to our attention that new players often think that the high-population servers are better, based upon the logic that if everyone else is there, it must be a good server.  However, in Massively-Multiplayer games, less populated servers are often considered superior for gameplay.  Therefore we have marked servers that would benefit from new characters as preferred servers, listing them in "green" in the server selection window.  The preferred servers have populations such that an influx of new people would benefit the server rather than cause overpopulation.<br> <br><br><b>*Custom Emotes and AFK*</b><br> <br>Animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type "/point Baobob", the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but you must specify the target as "say" as the target. For instance: <br> <br>/point say points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it. <br> <br>...your character will execute the /point animation, and the text output will be: "CharacterName points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it." <br> <br>Finally, you can now set a custom message for when you are /AFK.  Type "/AFK <message>" (without the brackets) to set your custom AFK message.  For instance, if you type "/afk Grabbing a snack", you will reply with "Grabbing a snack" when someone sends you a /tell.<br> <br><br><b>*Skill Gain*</b><br> <br>The skill-gain rate of many skills is now further modified by character stats.  This will allow those with natural affinities towards certain skills to improve at a greater rate.<br> <br><br><b>*Trade Skills Enhanced*</b><br> <br>Many of the trade skills in game have received massive enhancements, including dozens of new craftable items, new fishing and foraging items, and other things to be discovered once in game.  <br> <br>In addition, trade-skill specialization has been implemented.  Players will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally available tradeskills. This includes: <br> <br>- Baking<br>- Blacksmithing<br>- Brewing<br>- Jewelcraft<br>- Tailoring<br>- Fletching<br>- Pottery <br> <br>Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be able to exceed 200.  Specialization restrictions do not include class or race-specific trade skills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering.  Players with race or class-specific trade skills will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in that skill, PLUS any generally available trade skill. <br> <br>The enhancement of trade skills is an on-going project.  Further enhancements will be made in the coming weeks.<br> <br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Steve and David!

Here's an excerpt:<UL>I know when one of my articles has hit the target squarely in the bullseye when two things happen. First, it must start up controversy on both sides of an argument. If I get nothing but e-mail coming in agreeing with me, then I feel like I've merely wasted my time stating the obvious. If I get nothing but e-mail coming in disagreeing with me, I've either failed to make my point or I need to reevaluate what it is I said.<br><br>The second thing that needs to happen is a wide dissemination. Word needs to get out to a widespread readership to the point where enough people actually found the material in the article interesting enough to read in the first place.</UL>Enjoy!

The following word was sent in by Azriel:<BLOCKQUOTE> POVAR NEWBIE EVENT - 20 September 2000, 7PM EST<br> <br> I awoke today to find my older sister missing from her bunk. I have searched the area, and now suspect foul play. My sister is a formidable person, with many enemies, and yet all her items of power were found laying strewn around her bedroom. She would never have left our abode without them. I have followed the trail as far as I can, but the attitude of the guards of Qeynos prevent me from venturing further, they seem to want to lay waste to my young inexperienced self. I am searching for brave GROUPS of adventurers to rescue my sister. I have a few clues which may lead in the correct direction, but I can follow them no further. If you're a brave adventurer, and would like to help me search for my sister, please we are gathering in Qeynos Hills, close to the border of West Karana at 7pm 20 September (this date and time in the mystical world knowns as Eastern Standard Time, Earth). I will give ALL my earthly possessions to the group of adventurers that return my sister to me alive. And so far many donations have been given by friends of my sister to add to the rewards. We are seeking groups of six adventurers from the 1st to the 18th Cycle. Prepare well, for if they captured my sister, then they must be powerful themselves.<br> <br>Young Warrior Azriel, brother of Angelodeth Azriel</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

I received the following from Dirge:<BLOCKQUOTE>Cresting the last of several gentle hills, the exiled<br>Teir&#8217;dal woman narrowed her eyes, focusing on the<br>stoic grandeur of the walls of her second home&#8230;<br>Qeynos.  Amorsaylnn Frost smiled to herself.  The<br>humans had come to accept her, though many still<br>harbored some doubts about her intentions.  Her musing<br>was cut short by a cry of pain.  "Ahhhgggg&#8230;"  It<br>emerged from a young man, leaning against the<br>unforgiving stones of the wall.  <br><br>Amor turned, fumbling in her pack for spare bandages,<br>but his wounds were quite serious, beyond her ability<br>to mend.  He tried to speak.  "Those mangy dogs put up<br>a tough fight.  If I don&#8217;t make it back to the Clan<br>House soon, it&#8217;ll all be over for me."  There was a<br>brave, determined look in his eyes.  Amor had seen<br>death many times in her short life, but most often<br>people crumpled, whimpering for forgiveness and<br>safety.  This man was different, strong and would<br>accept death if she chose to embrace him.<br><br>"What dogs?" Amor asked, trying to support him.<br><br>He answered between gasps for breath.  "It&#8217;s those<br>Darkpaws&#8230; They&#8217;ve beat me pretty badly&#8230; but they&#8217;ll<br>get theirs soon enough!"<br><br>Amorsaylnn was not very interested in politics.  Truth<br>be told, she was very much a mercenary, having been<br>hired by another Teir&#8217;dal known as Shivrehel Despana<br>and his House, Winterborne.  She had fled Neriak in<br>the night, sent by her father, Makaz, to find this<br>Teir&#8217;dal and follow his path.  As it turned out, he<br>had strange connections with Lady Vox, the mythical<br>dragoness of the North.  Now she found herself<br>traveling frequently with his consort, a barbarian<br>witch by the name of Shar Hel Despana&#8230; and they made a<br>good team.<br><br>But being near Shiver meant hearing a lot of rumor and<br>suggestion.  He was a politician, at heart.  The last<br>bit of news she had heard before heading out to the<br>southern reaches of the Karanas was about a man named<br>Tomer Instogle, a member of the Silent Fist Clan.  He<br>was missing since he helped try and defend the Qeynos<br>Gates against the gnoll forces.<br><br>Amor knew there had been no formal alliance between<br>the monks of the Silent Fist and House Winterborne,<br>but they were, in theory, given to a similar purpose. <br>They were sworn to upholding the strength of Qeynos. <br>She whispered to the wounded man.  "I will take you to<br>your Clan House, Tomer."  He asked that she carry his<br>backpack for him.  It was the least they could do.  In<br>moments, she had escorted the monk to his House and<br>handed his backpack to his brothers that came to<br>assist.<br><br>Master Seta Bakindo was greatly relieved.  "We thought<br>that was the last we&#8217;d seen of him.  Thank you!"<br><br>The Teir&#8217;dal nodded, smiling slightly.  "It was the<br>least I could do.  House Winterborne is quite<br>interested in assisting the other noble Houses of<br>Qeynos.  These gnolls have caused much harm.  We would<br>be your allies, if you are interested."<br><br>Tomer was overcome with joy.  "Oh, you have the<br>makings of a true hero.. The Silent Fist Clan is proud<br>to have you as ally. May your soul guide and protect<br>you through these chaotic times!"<br><br><br>OOC ~ Winterborne will be hosting a newbie give-away<br>on the Xegony server, Monday the 25th at 8 PM EST. <br>Characters of level one (1) through five (5) who are<br>not anonymous may turn in three gnoll scalps at the<br>gates to Qeynos for a reward from among the following<br>prizes: medium banded armor, raw silk armor, fine<br>steel and forged weapons, and jade-silver rings.  Each<br>character may receive a maximum of three prizes (nine<br>gnoll scalps, total).  We will also be providing<br>buffs, healing, drinks, and excellent company&#8212;all<br>in-character&#8212;for those participating.  Even if you are<br>beyond this level range, we would welcome the<br>fellowship.

More information was posted by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board this evening.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015100.html"><b>Patch Hints</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Since the patch was delayed, can ya give us any clues as to what we can expect? From what Ive read from you so far it sound exciting.]</i></font> <br><br>A slew of enhancements and a handful of nerfs that we couldn't avoid any longer. I'm hoping that everyone will keep the posting rules in mind tomorrow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015123.html"><b>BoB Tournament Rewards</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does this ring fair to Nanak who won the BoB warrior tournament? He got a namechange, the level 60 one, and nothing more than that. In all fairness he should be given a very powerful special weapon that nobody else in the game can have as a reward for winning that<br><br>Please Verant I think you owe it to him. ]</i></font><br><br>Why? The reward for the competition is winning the competition itself. It's an event put on for the higher level folk who wish to offer themselves as the best of the best. Why should an additional reward be necessary? <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015162.html"><b>Keeping Your Cool</b></a><br>I'd really appreciate it if people didn't respond to those posts from people who think that they are "going out in style" by coming in here and spamming racial slurs and profantiy. There's nothing "stylish" about it, and replying to their posts only encourage them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015167.html"><b>FBSS</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Please make the FBSS no drop.]</i></font> <br><br>We really don't like the idea of going around and making every desired item NODROP. Brad made a post a couple of days ago to that effect. <br><br>In any case, I doubt that it will be as valuable after tomorrow. We found a bug with the way "haste" items stack with "haste" spells. Basically, even the worst haste item combined with the worst haste spell would put the wearer at the haste cap. This basically invalidated the better haste items and spells, and explains why people have been saying that the newer haste items aren't any better than the FBSS. <br><br>This is being fixed in tomorrow's patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014979.html"><b>Disable Destroy Button During Looting</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In most situations we are forced to speed loot to avoid futher deaths. I have destroyed several items in these situations, items that where difficult to acquire or expensive to purchase. I realize that there is a Button to confirm item destruction, but thats just another button to have to click during loots. Most of the time in dungeons the game lags bad enough without having to deal with more twitching.]</i></font> <br><br>I'd have a hard time convincing the guys that yet another level of security is needed here. Sure, I've accidently destroyed items while looting, and when that happened, I turned fast item destroy off. I'd hate to not have the ability to destroy and item while looting, since that's where the majority of my destroys take place. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015023.html"><b>Mages and mana Regen Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Will Magicians ever get Mana Regen spells? it really seems to me that all other pure casters have this. It would greatly help mage Magicians a more robust class.]</i></font> <br><br>Beyond meditation, no. Mages are pretty robust as it is, and the complaints that I've heard don't appear to be tied to mana.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015049.html"><b>Real Issue on Posting</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Many players post with more than one idea/issue/rant/etc on mind. The post is usually mixed with emotion and feelings and facts all jumbled up. Next step is Gordon (or whomever) reads the post and answers the post. Now the postee may have had 8 points in the post but all revolving around a central issue. Gordon (or whomever) replys to 1 or 2 or more of the points but may miss the main point. <br><br>I suggest that we number our issues 1 by 1, making it hard for Gordon (or whomever) to "accidently" miss answering a point. Make your posts clear and concise. What Im suggesting is an unofficial format.]</i></font> <br><br>It's a good idea. Clear and concise points are more likely to be addressed. This of course assumes that it is a point that I want to address. In all fairness, those 8 point posts that you mention often only have 1 or 2 points that it would be beneficial to address.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014462-2.html"><b>Harvest: Make It Like Harm Touch/Lay of Hands</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is one thing that REALLY bothers me about Harvest though. It permanently uses up a spell slot. Now, you might say necros need to use a spell slot for lich, but once they cast it then they can unmem it until they need it again. Same goes for clarity.<br><br>Wizards can not afford to EVER unmem harvest ]</i></font><br><br>It's a tradeoff. Wizards decide whether or not they want to have the spell available always, and "pay" for that decision with a spell slot should they choose that they do. <br><br>It's a good enough spell that it is worth a slot, at least for those who keep it memmed all of the time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011329-2.html"><b>Why is it NO-Drop?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Verant-Abashi: Why is this Item NO DROP???<br>Item: Sarnak Earring of Station ]</i></font><br><br>I don't know, perhaps it's used for a quest? <br><br>Anyway, this really doesn't seem like that big of a deal. There are over 10K items in game now, and as we get more and more it gets harder to insert them into the same mesh as others. Some are bound to have stats and settings that have no great plan behind them, or have one that isn't apparent at the time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014922.html"><b>Playing Your Class</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: yes, the only answer we have got, was something like: learn to play your class right and show others what you can do. i found this very insulting. someone who has no clue about hybrids (not a flame gordon, noone knows everything about every class..... )past 50 tells a lot of good SKs to learn more.......]</i></font> <br><br>Thankfully I have someone playing every class pretty close at hand :)  Yes, that includes the SK. One of the most avid EQ players in house here has a high level SK built from scratch. He's also one of the decision-makers, so it works out fairly well. Suffice it to say that he thinks that SKs are fantastic, and I'll agree with him on that point, despite the issues that you brought up. </UL>
