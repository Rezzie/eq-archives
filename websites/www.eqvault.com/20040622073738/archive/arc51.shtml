This is the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063132.html">original post and Brad McQuaid's response</a> from a thread devoted to various community issues:<UL>They should just change things as they see appropriate. They should have invested the time and energy they put into these boards to have more people test the game actually IN-GAME.<br><br>It is THEIR game, they can make the rules however they want. Allowing the player base a forum to vent and suggest changes has actually decreased customer satisfaction. It looks good on paper, and is a tremendous effort to keep communication open, but it has been a failure. Yeah, they probably gleaned a little useful info off of these boards. But has it been worth the headaches? Have they gotten the return on the investment? NOW the customers perceive it is their RIGHT to mandate changes to VERANT's product. Of course we can just stop playing. If they never would have opened up this can of worms, players would just....PLAY. Of course we would get angry over issues or changes, but an open forum such as this amplifies dissatisfaction.<br>I know it is not quite right to compare other traditional games to EQ, but have you ever heard of a game or product manufacturer that goes through so much effort to solicit customer input? And 99% of these posts are negativem it seems.<br><br>I appreciate the effort, and I can imagine the meetings when they decided these boards were a good idea.<br><br>"Yes Alan, we will have a whole site dedicated to hearing our customer, and responding to their needs on an ongoing basis! Johnson, you work with Bradley and design it. That is the key to a long lasting MMPRPG people, real time customer feedback."<br>Maybe it has helped EQ to last longer. EQ has lasted a long time, and I bet will last a few years more. But they also have learned some very important lessons.<br><br>First, the majority of people in the world are selfish morons who are unable to see past the tip of their nose.<br><br>Second, soliciting input from this majority is a BIG DRAG and largely pointless. They end up spending days and hours and hours sifting through the unending load of crap and looking for a little gold.<br>And third, message board detail is NOT a fun assignment, but great for shuffling some poor schmuck into the limelight for 15 minutes. Wonder if just prior to reassigment here the next 'victim board moderator' goes home to his/her spouse all excited about their 'big break'? "Honey, this is big time, I am on the front line between our cutomers and the company. Man, I cant wait until Monday...this will really look good on a resume...I am really gonna change things there too"<br>Like I said the effort is appreciated, but the resource committment is misplaced.<br><br><same board moderator two weeks later><br>"Honey, nothing is WRONG, I just hate that place. I have been listening to people whine and cry all day on that @#$@ board, I dont need you whining now when I get home..." <br><br><b><i>Thanks for the feedback so far (excluding the x-files Aradune = Manglosh sillyness).<br><br>We will continue to read this thread very carefully.<br><br>I will say that if we do make a major change, we will still absolutely have a very real means by which our players can give us feedback. This board has been a huge resource for us (and hopefully many of you) -- many, many changes have been made because of ideas and feedback from this board, and so any change we might make cannot risk losing that feedback.<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>

George M. Scotto wrote the latest <a href="http://www.everquest.com/main/letter.jsp">Producer Letter</a> found on the official EQ site.  Customer Service and several policy updates were the main focus of this letter.  The big and most important points of the letter can be found in this excerpt:<UL>Communication will be the key and, naturally, it&#8217;s a two way street. Your concerns have been voiced to us, and we are responding. As you read this, several policies are in the process of being refined. Within the coming weeks, we will be posting several new policy FAQ&#8217;s at <a href="http://www.everquest.com/support/index.jsp.">http://www.everquest.com/support/index.jsp.</a> Our goal is to make it perfectly clear not only what we expect from you as player-citizens of Norrath, but also what you can count on from us here at Verant/SOE. <br><br>Our first step in response to players&#8217; concerns was posted recently. Our new and updated Naming Policy (<a href="http://www.everquest.com/support/naming.jsp">http://www.everquest.com/support/naming.jsp</a>) should hopefully be clearer, more consistent, and bring us even closer to a healthy role-playing environment. Subsequently, we will be conducting a thorough review of all current character names on all servers, including surnames and guild names. Names not necessarily in line with the updated Naming Policy will be evaluated and handled accordingly. </UL>Thanks Alan.

From PlanetEverQuest:<blockquote>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/022701/index.shtml">EQ Quiz centers on Rogues</a>.  What do you know about them?  You've grouped with them sure.  But what sneaky things are they doing when you aren't around?  Are they perhaps gaining your trust and confidence only to stab you in the back later because someone put out an assassination notice on your head? Perhaps they are sneaking a quick peek (and hand) into your pockets when you're not looking.<br><br>This "just for fun" test will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the live cuisinart blade masters of Norrath.  Skill with the dagger isn't all that rogues do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about these stealthy assassins.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Back on that <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062233-2.html">Board Rules Thread</a>, Alan took the time to respond to some of the issues players raised concerning the original post:<UL><b>Orignalkli wrote:</b></i><br><br>Dont tell me you are gonna be playing "Big Brother" here.

Auric Flamewalker <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062233.html">wrote up an extensive post</a> on the rules and policies enforced on the official boards:<UL><i>Hail and well met all.<br><br>I have seen recently many questions regarding why a post was closed or deleted. The main reason we close or delete a thread is when it is an attack on one person or a group of people. Below are the guidelines for posting on this forum. Please read through this carefully if you post frequently on this board. Any posts that do not meet the criteria below will be deleted or closed. Any infraction of these rules can result in warnings issued to your Everquest accout, suspension or banning of your Everquest account, depending on severity of the offense.<br><br>1.0 Official EverQuest Forums<br>This section of the FAQ is primarily concerned with the Official EverQuest forums, and the conduct that is considered appropriate and inappropriate when posting to those forums.<br><br>Q: What is the purpose of the Official EverQuest forums?<br>The Official EverQuest Forums exist as a place for EverQuest players to gather and discuss issues related to EverQuest. Some forums (e.g. Customer Service, General Discussion, Quality Assurance) are visited frequently by official representatives regularly, and serve as a place for players to communicate with some of the various EverQuest teams (e.g. Development, QA, and Customer Service). These forums allow us, as developers, the opportunity to discuss issues that the players feel are important.<br><br>Q: Who may post on the Official EverQuest Forums?<br>In the initial implementation, "Customer Service / Technical Help" will be open to the public. While anyone may read all of the forums, the remaining forums will only allow posts from active EverQuest account holders.<br><br>Q: Why is posting to the Official EverQuest Forums restricted?<br>While we would like to keep posting open to everyone regardless of their account status, in the past, the official EverQuest forums have had some problems maintaining a suitable posting environment due to the relative anonymity of the posters. With little to no tangible reason to keep posting behavior in check, some posters took advantage of the anonymity provided by the forums to post often vulgar and otherwise inappropriate material on the boards.<br>As EverQuest is a family game, with people of all ages participating in the gaming community, we as developers have a responsibility to maintain a suitable environment to the best of our ability. The only way to accomplish this goal in regards to the Official Forums is to reduce the relative anonymity of the forums, thus allowing us to eject posters who post material that is inappropriate for public consumption.<br><br>Q: I'm concerned about security of my account. If I must log in with a valid Station Name to post, doesn't that give someone half of the key needed to hack my account?<br>No. Though you will be logging in (through a secure connection) with your valid station name and password, the station name will not be displayed. Instead, entirely within our local network, the Station login server will connect to the registered account database and obtain the "Chat Handle". This is a unique identifier that you chose when creating your EverQuest account.<br>All posts made to the board in restricted forums will display your "Chat Handle" rather than your "Station Name". Should you wish to change your Chat Handle, you can do so within the EverQuest chat server. Type #help within the chat server for a list of commands.<br><br>Q: What are the rules for posting in these forums?<br>As the Official EverQuest Forums are part of The Station, posting to these forums is bound by The Station's Terms of Service that can be found in their entirety at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml">http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml</a> <br><br>In addition to these terms of service, we have a few supplemental rules that apply to the EverQuest Forums.<br>In general, you may post any material, written in a courteous and mature manner, providing that it is on-topic for the forum to which you are posting. This includes material that disagrees with the way that we, the developers, operate the game. We will not interfere with the communication of thoughts and ideas as long as the presentation is appropriate for all those capable of reading the forum.<br><br>You may not, however, post any material that:<br>&#61623; Attacks or insults others on the board. Feel free to debate the idea, but do not turn your disagreement into an attack upon the poster. <br>&#61623; Engages in name-calling, harassment, or threats. See above. <br>&#61623; Contains obscenity, vulgarity, or profanity. Though we do have a filter in place to catch the unintentional obscenity from time to time, this is not a license to abuse it. <br>&#61623; Disparages any religion, race, nation, gender, or sexual orientation. <br>&#61623; Is considered inappropriate for children 13 or over as governed by general standards of decency in the United States. <br>&#61623; Infringes on anyone's privacy rights.<br><br>Furthermore, you may not:<br>&#61623; Make multiple posts on the same subject for the purpose of getting attention paid to your issue. <br>&#61623; Post off-topic comments in threads for the purpose of drawing attention to another thread on a different subject. <br>&#61623; Monopolize the front page of any forum by "bumping" threads of the same or similar content to the front. We may intervene by closing threads any time that this occurs. <br>&#61623; Use the official forums as a staging-ground for creating general unrest within the game (e.g. Sit-ins). <br>&#61623; Use the official forums as a place to advertise the sale of EverQuest characters or items in exchange for real-world money. <br>&#61623; Advertise web-sites with content that violates these rules, the EverQuest EULA, or the Station Terms of Service. <br>&#61623; Advertise products or websites that are not related to EverQuest or other Verant/Sony Online Entertainment products. <br><br>Q: What happens if these rules are broken?<br>Action that we might take in regards to a post in violation of these rules on the Official EverQuest Forums will vary depending upon the transgression. It could include any number of the following:<br>&#61623; Editing of the post. <br>&#61623; Deletion of the post/thread. <br>&#61623; Closing of the thread. <br>&#61623; Suspension (results in user being unable to play EverQuest for the duration of the suspension). <br>&#61623; Banishment (results in the user's station account being canceled. User will no longer be able to access EverQuest, or any Official EverQuest Forum). <br>&#61623; Legal Action (I.e. Contacting law enforcement personnel in regard to a threat.) <br>People who violate the rules of the boards may or may not receive any warning before any action is taken. In the event that a warning is given, the warning will be recorded upon the game account and may result in further action should the player show a pattern of engaging in prohibited conduct. Philosophically and administratively, there is no difference between conduct in game, and conduct in the Official EverQuest Forums.<br>Q: Ok, we know what we shouldn't do, what should we do?<br>Give your posts some thought, and try to be courteous and respectful. Disagreeing with someone does not mean that you have to be anything less than courteous in your dealings. Read over what you plan on posting before hitting the "Submit" button, and imagine how you would feel if the post was aimed at you. Would you be personally offended? If so, you should consider rephrasing the post or canceling it altogether.<br><br>Thank you for your time and thoroughness.<br>Auric.</i></UL>

So, unfortunately, we have to say no to some customers, especially when their request would adversely affect other customers.<br><br>Making the game the better is in the best interest of all customers. When making changes to game mechanics that don't work properly, that's what we have to consider as out first priority.

As I have said, there may indeed be an issue in certain situations, and we are looking at that. But there is an undeniable affect that happens with things like this. There is a snowball thing, one person claims that something has been done to make something really bad and before others have even tried it out, they are agreeing and insisting that it be 'fixed'. This becomes a problem for us. We need feedback on the game. This sort of thing, however, is not feedback, it is misinformation.<br><br>All I was saying was that if people want to provide feedback, please do so. We're reading as many of these posts as we can. But posting something that basically says, 'I haven't even played since the change, but the change is bad', isn't very convincing as feedback.<br><br>Keep posting your experiences, we are reading them.

Banegrivm announced the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings, <br><br>      I wanted to take this time out to make everyone aware of the Druzzil <br>Ro Alliance. What is the Druzzil Ro Alliance? The Druzzil Ro Alliance is a <br>collection of Guilds on the Druzzil Ro Server that have formed together for <br>the purpose of doing high level dungeons, planes, and dragons, without having <br>the necessity of being in a high level guild. With such an alliance all the <br>participating guilds remain in their present guild and are never forced to <br>lose their guild tag. This way they are not forced into giving up their home <br>or their friendships with those they have grown to know and love, and still <br>get to play the game...on their own terms. <br><br>      Their is now an option for those that want to be involved in the high <br>level end of the game. No longer will people be forced to be in a guild with <br>people they do not care to associate with on a daily basis. Now people will <br>have the option of remaining within the confines of their guild and doing <br>said raids and staying in their home without ever losing their guild tag. <br>When raids are conducted no guild will ever demand any guild member from the <br>alliance ever to disband from their guild for the purpose of the raid. All <br>those in the raid remain tagged into their guild for the conductivity of the <br>raid. No one ever loses their guild tag under any conditions where it <br>corresponds to the Druzzil Ro Alliance and its operations with regards to <br>raiding. <br><br>      The Druzzil Ro Alliance has also come up with some base policies such <br>as looting and simply working together as a team. The later will force guild <br>leaders to be guild leaders and help to keep relations friendly between <br>guilds. Not everyone will see eye to eye one hundred percent of the time, but <br>that does not mean we can not be civil and respectable and try our best to <br>bring about an honest and honorable resolve to whatever the situation may be. <br>In short the Druzzil Ro Alliance is in it for fun. We pay monthly fees a <br>month to have fun, so fun we shall have, and what better way to do it then <br>with our friends. <br><br>      If you are a respective guild leader and interested in joining the <br>Druzzil Ro Alliance please visit the forums at www.druzzilroalliance.cjb.net <br>and read the looting rules under the General Discussion forums. If you agree <br>with these rules then please leave a post in the General Discussion forums <br>requesting to join and you shall be prompty added to the Druzzil Ro Alliance. <br>Please make sure you leave your website URL if applicable in the post so we <br>may add it as a link. This way anyone interested in being in a guild apart of <br>the alliance will have an easier time in chosing a guild in which they can <br>call their home. <br><br>      If you have a greivance with an alliance member and wish to enter your <br>guild into the alliance please leave said greivance at the door upon <br>entering. No one will hold anything upon any other alliance members. The past <br>is simply the past and this is a new beginning for us all. As well, no one <br>will be refused admittance into the alliance as well...so long as they agree <br>to the loot rules. We shall endeavor in all things to enjoy our company, and <br>our fellowship, and the game we have come to know as EverQuest. Here it is an <br>even playing field, and for us involved it shall be our fun and our enjoyment <br>of the game. To those of you who may be joining you are welcomed with open <br>arms.

The Druid cap was raised on TEST SERVER. No changes to Druid tracking have been made to live servers. Please stop posting this kind of inaccurate nonsense.]</i></font><br><br>True, this is only on Test right now. And you folks all need to be aware that stuff on Test will not always go live. <br><br>But I can explain why Druid tracking might be getting an increase. It's really the same reason that it was always lower than a Bard's skill before. Before all the cool changes to tracking it was actually better to have a lower skill number than a higher one, unless you had a really high skill. Basically, because there was no scrolling, Bards with their slightly higher skill were actually worse at tracking than druids because the higher skill would create a lot of clutter. This was done at the request of the Druid community. <br><br>So the plan is to raise the Druid cap so that they are still better at tracking than Bards. That's the plan anyway.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061249-2.html"><b>Whiniest Class in Norrath Poll</b></a><br>Sorry folks, but I'm closing this one.

I hate to do this, but let's look at the Evade. Some Rogues were convinced that the changes we made to Evade were going to make them worthless, long before they had a chance to play with it. 'One backstab and die'. It turns out that they are, if not excited about the change, accepting of it. But only now that they've actually played with it. <br><br>Please, play the game. See what we've done. We want feedback from people that have tried it out. You do yourself and your fellow players a disservice with posts like this. <br><br>Thanks to those of you that have played with the changes. As you continue to play with them, and as your tactics evolve (and we know that you'll find good ones), let's talk about the effects of this change.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061474.html"><b>NPCs and Inventory</b></a><br>Lieah wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No where does any NPC state that a general inventory lot was to be opened.

Its just a game, let me have my fun and give my item back, this is pathetic.]</i></font><br><br>I'm sorry that you lost your item. But in the case where the NPCs is going give you a container you must have an open inventory slot for that container. This is something that most people understand by the time they've played long enough to be trying to complete an epic quest. We've posted about this, and I'm pretty sure that this was also placed on a patch message. <br><br>I wanted to take this opportunity to stress this again. If you are completing a quest, any quest, make certain that you have an inventory slot open to receive any items that are given to you by the NPC. It is recommended that you keep a few open, just in case.</UL>
