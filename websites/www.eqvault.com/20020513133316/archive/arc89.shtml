<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Here's the latest quotes from Gordon Wrinn that he posted on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063887.html"><b>Rallos Zek</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why wont you answer rallos?]</i></font> <br><br>I have, many times. It's just not the answer that people want to hear. We've no plans to change loot rules on Rallos at this time, nor do we plan on allowing any moves in regards to Rallos. I'm sorry, but there's really only so many ways that I can address this, and each time has lead to a flame-o-thon on the boards. I'd prefer to stay away from the threads for the time being. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You all put up alternate servers and are doing splits like crazy.]</i></font> <br><br>I've seen people recommend that we should put up another server with Rallos rules, sans item loot, and do a split, however the number of people playing on Rallos wouldn't make that an economically feasible course of action. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It was supposed to be the most real roleplay server. Now it has turned into an ebay-athon, and you allow the two new pvp servers to go coin only and stop the insane lack of roleplay which comes from a broken pvp system where a melee class is outclassed by ANY caster at ANY level over 12.]</i></font> <br><br>If it has turned into "naked item gank" server as so many say, does that mean that a majority of people are engaging in that behavior? If not, why is it that people who are against this don't socially isolate the people who are acting like this? I see posts here every day from people who want it one way or the other. I saw people on Vallon complaining as loudly for coin-only loot as people on Rallos. We made the change, and then people from Vallon complained just as loudly for item-loot. <br><br>As of now, we've switched two servers to coin-only loot, which is the majority of the PvP servers out there. While we do want to please the majority and believe that they should have some say, we need to keep in mind the wishes of the minority. The minority here is significant. <br><br>The 4 level limit on Rallos makes item-loot much more viable on that server than it was on the team servers with their 8 level limit. I recommend that if the majority on Rallos truly detests "naked ganking", that you come together as a community and outlaw the practice through social action.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063886.html"><b>More on Bows</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is a problem, but what about the rest of the post, and the blocking of arrows by PC's? This I believe is the largest concern, as I said the other was but a minor suggestion. Are there any reforms to deal with this problem being discussed? Or is this not an option / concern at this point? Any clairification is appreciated.]</i></font> <br><br>Projectiles are designed to be blocked by obstacles. The same issue occurs with "bolt" type spells. So to answer your question, it is not something that we consider a problem, but rather the way it was designed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063884.html"><b>Question about the Item Dropbox</b></a><br>While the commands that we finally implement won't be as verbose as you request, we have looked at the requests of people and will probably make them more verbose than was originally announced. I'll refrain from commenting further on it until we've nailed down the technical issues and are ready to implement it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063880.html"><b>Why aren't there custom text colors?</b></a><br>It's a suggestion that's been made frequently, and is something that we'd love to do at some point, however the "problem" at hand keeps getting more and more complex. When EQ was first launched there were only a few different types of "messages" that were displayed in the Chat window. Since then we've added a lot of different things due to player request, such as loot messages, taunt messages, we're about to add item drop messages, NPCs are now doing different things, and the list keeps growing. <br><br>Our ability to implement color selections for all of those different types of messages in the client is wanning. It is however something that we will definitely keep in mind.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063878.html"><b>Melee Classes Getting Pets?!</b></a><br>As the melee classes as a whole are balanced, certainly in terms of damage output, a pet wouldn't be appropriate in this case.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063883.html"><b>/Consent Changes</b></a><br>As I mentioned in a few other messages, there were technical and other considerations involved in the decision to get rid of looting. Truth be told, given the short term indications following the change, the immense load off of the GMs due to corpse scaming, we probably don't want to go down the road again. <br><br>Even with seperate commands, many of the corpse scamming issues surrounded people being scamed in to giving consent in the first place. Those issues would still remain if we opened back up corpse looting. Though I do understand that it might be a difficult change for some to accept so soon after it's been made, experience has shown that the number of times players want others to loot their corpse rather than drag it is *very* small. So small in fact that it's not worth the risk to reenable it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063879.html"><b>"Play a Bard and see how bad they are!"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am sick and tired of seeing that every gm in a zone is a DE necro, or a SK or somesort. Obviously they know that bards have a disadvantage and are not "good enough" to play]</i></font> <br><br>There are quite a few GMs who have bards as their GM character, but it really doesn't matter since the GMs don't play their characters. <br><br>That said, bards certainly aren't "bad". They are loved by groups which is right where their area of expertise is supposed to be. I have received word of a few songs that might be having problems right now, not working as intended, but those shortcomings are only ancillary to the entire scope of the bard.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050749-3.html"><b>PVP Thread</b></a><br>With the proliferation of posts like this, I thought I'd stop by and recommend that you rephrase your post in a new thread, sans insults, and I might take a stab at it. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063568.html"><b>The VAK'ers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi only answers VAKs]</i></font> <br><br>Hmmm, several months ago the posts read, "Abashi only answers flames." I must be making progress. <br><br>It does disturb me to see that anyone who posts something positive here is labled a VAK, or even worse, accused of being "planted". Seriously, it doesn't even have to be a "positive" post, just one that's written in a courteous manner and they get flamed. It's so bad that I've received hundreds of emails that say something along the lines of, "I don't want to post this on gameplay and get flamed....but..." <br><br>But back to the subject, if you want to know what type of posts I look for, it's the courteous, well-written ones on subjects that I haven't addressed in a while. I also gravitate towards those *posters* who have always written in a courteous and respectful manner, even if they've been in disagreement. And of course, by the same token, I typically avoid posts by people who generally flame and only get courteous when they have an issue that is important to *them* that they need addressed. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063808.html"><b>Mage Utility Improvement Suggestion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Proposal: summoned bags turn into permanent, non-weight reducing, NODROP bags upon camp/LD.]</i></font> <br><br>That's an interesting suggestion. I know that we'd have some technical issues with it, but they might not be insurmountable. I think that we'd just have to be certain that there is nothing to gain by going linkdead. <br><br>I really don't like the idea of injecting risk via out-of-game random chance either. I'll talk to the team about it. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063872.html"><b>Problem with Bows</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: One minor problem, and it is minor, but a slight decrease in delay times for bows globally would help to increase the use of bows as well, and add a whole new facet to gameplay without, in my opinion, unbalancing it.]</i></font> <br><br>We wouldn't be able to do an across-the-board lowering of bow delays due to the amount that it would increase damage output over a large time model. However, we are looking into negating the delay in the event that you are too close or too far away when you activate the bow. This would allow you to correct the situation and fire again immediatly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063875.html"><b>Belt of River Nerfed?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I was just finishing off a Spectre in Feerott and out of nowhere Roror started attacking me. I'm a Halfling cleric who has never hunted in Cazic Thule so I couldn't have messed up any factions. This Lizard can kill a well armored and fully buffed lvl 42 cleric in about 5 seconds. I thought about this and am wondering if he hates everyone after the patch how in the world are you supposed to do the quest? He should at least not be Kos to Haflings!]</i></font><br><br> The lizardmen outside Cazic Thule were all attached to the wrong faction (Faction "LizardMan"). They were supposed to be aligned with the "good" (relatively) lizards inside the temple. Due to the potential for unexpected death on the part of the players, warnings of this change was put in the patch message. Word has it that there's a way to get in the good graces of those who now attack.</UL>

I wanted to drop a quick note to let everyone know what's in store for the next week.  <br><br>Along with the two pages of the new comic section, I plan to try and catch up with the Featured Artwork section again by posting new artwork (from a large variety of artists) every day.  My apologizes to the ever-patient artists for having to wait, we realize the huge ammount of time you guys put into your creations and the desire to see your art up as soon as possible.<br><br>More Player Guides, Kunark Strategy and Fan Fiction will be posted as well before I leave for the last part of my summer vacation.  I'll prepare some extra content for my sub to post while I'm away of course.  After that we'll resume the semi-normal flow of content from then on. :)<br><br>Thanks and have a good night!

I am very proud to announce the unveiling of <a href="/features/comic">EverQuests</a>, a new exciting addition to the EQ community.  EverQuests is the first professionally penned adventure comic that takes place in Norrath and is available to view by the general public.<br><br><b>The Story</b><br>The EverQuest's "Official Player's Guide" contains the gruesome story of Miragul.  This tale relates how he traps himself inside a phylactery before transferring his soul inside his lich.  At the end the lich wanders aimlessly while over the centuries Miragul rages, a captive inside his device.<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/display.cgi?/features/comic/Everquests1.jpg"><img src="/features/comic/Everquests1_thumb.jpg" width=100 height=140  align="right" alt="Promotion Cover #1"></a><i>Our story starts with a small band of dissidents on the Frigid Plain.   They plan to help Miragul by freeing his soul so he can possess the lich and continue with his "endless exploration and discovery".  They achieve this.  <br><br>But, unknown to them, Miragul has gone insane and now wants to only have revenge on all of Norrath... <br><br>The head of the Wizard's Council sends an Erudite apprentice wizard to gather a small group of brave souls and one innocent cleric to undo the damage.  The cleric carries a new phylactery to house the soul of Miragul, should our heros manage to capture him.<br><br>And our story begins...</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The characters in this comic are famous NPCs that players can recognize and see regardless of the server they are playing on. We start out with Jys D'Bious, a Shadow Knight seller of spells, Eonis Mournunder, head Nacro gnome, and a troll basher named Oggrik.  They are the dissidents who let Miragul loose on the world.<br><br>EverQuests was created by <a href="mailto:kanli@aol.com">Barry Blair</a> and is drawn by <A HREF="http://www.barryblair.com/">Blair Grafix</A>.  We here at the EQVault are very excited to be able to exclusively host the comic online.<br><br>Page one will be published this Monday and plans are to publish page two on Tuesday.  Until then, check out the <a href="/display.cgi?/features/comic/Everquests1.jpg">promo cover</a> available now!  We have also created a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5255"><b>Message Board</b></a> to discuss the comic in-depth.<br><br>Be sure to check this one out!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon addressed a few posts on the Gameplay Board today.  For your convience I have compiled them all in the following text:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061410-3.html"><b>Roleplaying Server Thread</b></a><br>My understanding from reading the first post, and please let me know if I'm off base, is that you'd like us to set up a server, designated as "Roleplay", provide guidelines for playing on the server, with more GM/Guide support for dynamic content. Furthermore, though the guidelines would exist, there would be no enforcement of it. <br><br>Assuming that summation is close to what you are proposing, I'm pretty sure that your goals wouldn't be met in the long run. I think immediately people would go to the server with ideas about always staying in character. However, there are also people who play the game that would go there just to annoy the roleplayers. Then there would also be people who would go there due to having more GM/Guide support for dynamic content. In the end, without any enforcement, which most will agree cannot be applied consistantly, I think they would end up less in-character role-playing than other servers in the game. <br><br>Experience has shown that without enforcement in an environment such as this, the desired condition cannot be met. Take this board as an example. Flaming, insulting, swearing, threatening, and being a general anti-social troublemaker is not allowed on these boards per the Station Terms of Service. Attempts to ask those people who post in that fashion to keep it respectful and courteous further drives the overall environment towards the undesirable. Why? Because it's not enforced. We are going to enforce those rules in the near future, and it will either work, or the boards will be shut down. I think that an unenforced roleplay server would have the same problem. <br><br>But we can come up with consistant rules to enforce the boards, where we can't with a subjective concept such as roleplaying. I really like Har's definition of roleplaying, but can we expect any 10 people to enforce that definition in the same way?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063545-2.html"><b>"Reconsider Yellow Spell Damage Text"</b></a><br>There's obviously people here who both like and dislike the yellow color. Given that we introduced the yellow color, I don't think that we'll make everyone happy by changing it back, so we'll probably leave it as is. Perhaps if we had left it white/black it wouldn't be an issue, but the cats out of the bag :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063537.html"><b>"Why was Invisibility Nerfed, again?"</b></a><br>It seems that after nearly every patch someone feels that invisibility has been nerfed in duration. I know that I've had to make posts such as this after well over a dozen patches since I've been at Verant. <br><br>Just to be clear, invisibility was touched in this patch, aside from making it so that pets are no longer a valid target. In order to try to head off future claims of this nature, I *promise* that I will let you know if we ever touch invisibility's duration. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063739.html"><b>"As a Master of Magical Damage, why is a Ranger's channeling skill higher than mine?"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Rangers cap at 215, Wizards at 200. What is the vision behind this?]</i></font><br><br>As it turns out, we increased the channeling cap for pure casters in the last patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059195.html"><b>The Vision</b></a><br>I've answered dozens of questions entitled "what is the vision". Why is it that these keep coming up with people assuming that it is some tangible thing that can be put up on a website for all to view? Have you ever said to anyone, "That wasn't really what I had in mind..."? What you are saying is that it doesn't agree with your vision. <br><br>There is not some all-encompassing document that I can post somewhere for everyone to read, because it's an ever-growing and ever-changing concept. When something new comes up, we sit down and ask, "Is this what we had in mind?" A discussion follows at which time we decide whether or not it is. The vision is every email exchanged by every member of the dev team. It's the original design document for EverQuest (which will not be posted). It's the understanding that comes out of formal meetings in the conference room and the informal ones around the watercooler. It's every hope that everyone here had and has for EverQuest. <br><br>Do you want to know the vision? Read our web site, read our posts, play the game, and ask yourself honestly what we had in mind, or, ask me. I answer questions every day here that consist basically of, "Why did you do XXX?" The answer to that question is the vision. But please, don't expect me to be able to lay out anything and everything that everyone ever had in mind about everything to do with the game. It's not that simple. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I dislike playing a game where 95% of the important information is hidden from the consumer's eyes. ]</i></font><br><br>That 95% of that information is meant to be discovered by you while you play the game. If you choose to go to spoiler sites to find out as much as you can, that is your choice, but we won't be divulging the mystery of the game. We feel that mystery is important in the game and that no one should know with certainty everything that there is to know. That's our vision. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The only thing I know is what the VISION isn't. It isn't kiting, it isn't FD pulling, it isn't having good stuff, it isn't a lot of things. ]</i></font></UL>

The following message is now up on the EQ Patch Server:<UL>July 20th, 3:00pm<br>-----------------<br><br><b>*Emergency Patch*</b><br><br>Due to the problems encountered in yesterday's patch, some additional data has been moved to the live servers today.  As part of this patch, three new changes are included:<br><br>- /Consent no longer gives other players permission to loot your corpse.  Instead, it only gives them the ability to drag your corpse using the /corpse command.  This change is due to player request stemming from number of customer service issues raised by some players who were using /consent as a way to steal the belongings of other players.  The change will eliminate those concerns and make the game more enjoyable for all of those involved.<br>- Yesterday's patch changed the way spell-damage messages are reported to the caster.  The new text was dark blue, making it hard to distinguish from the background when in HUD mode.  The text color has been changed to "yellow" due to player request.<br>- Duel messages will no longer be broadcast to the world unless the winner of the duel is over 10th level.  This should greatly reduce the number of duels with inappropriate names that have been occurring in the game.<br><br>We would like to apologize to everyone for the problems stemming from yesterday's patch, and let you know that we have taken steps to greatly reduce the possibility that something of that nature could happen in the future.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Gordon made a few posts recently on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063211.html"><b>Karana Split</b></a><br>I do find it strange that your guild wasn't moved. The second attempt only netted 169 accounts wishing to move. Though I was pleased to see that we did get most of the people who wanted to move in the first attempt, even given the short notice, I was still quite surprised to find it so small. <br><br>Have your friends kick an email to <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a>.

Intermediate items didn't, since most of those are components for the quests themselves. Most of the quests in the Plane of Sky have yet to be completed, so the number of people who saw increases might be pretty small.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063243.html"><b>Do I need to replace my Branch?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Your branch will remain in game as is  That decision has not been made yet.]</i></font> <br><br>It is true that this decision hasn't been made yet. We stopped the drops of the items pending the decision of what we are going to do with the existing ones, if anything. We'll probably discuss it Monday in the tuning meeting. <br><br>As you know, we seriously dislike making changes to items that already exist in game. However there are exceptions where we must for game balance. We're also considering the twig that everyone likes as well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063280.html"><b>Loot Tables/Foraging Bug: Blackout</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Actually i doubt you've missed it as in haven't seen or heard of it, just that it appears you've made afternoon rounds for posting on the boards and I've seen no response to what is obviously a very heated issue. <br><br>Namely, the bug with the loot tables and foraging last night. The worst thing to do is to leave us in the dark about this. It has been okay for us to debate it this morning while I'm sure you had many other things going on but now that you have seen fit to post on other topics some sort of update would be really appreciated. <br><br>What is Verants current stance on what happened? We know there was a loot bug, we know it has happened before, we have heard rumors of the scope of this problem (large and disturbing), and heard rumors that no corrective action is planned by Verant to restore the state of the game prior to the "incident". Does/has Verant taken any action to correct this? What would really help is some solid facts, and those are only going to come from one person. You.]</i></font><br><br>Rolling back the clock is always a very sensitive issue. <br><br>The problem was found very quickly, limiting its impact in game. In addition, the loot that was turning up was loot that was otherwise available within the zone, not just random in nature. It's not like level 60 gear was showing up on large rats or anything, people actually had to be in a zone where the equipment was found normally. <br><br>In this case, after weighing additional downtime necessary to do a rollback, the inconvenience to those who earned items during that time, and the loss of experinece and play time, we've decided not to pursue it further. <br><br>We wish to extend our sincere apologies to everyone over the entire issue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063082.html"><b>/Roleplay Bug</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No Aixsponsa.

Gordon was busy on the boards late last night and early this morning responding to several player-made posts.  Here's the skinny:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063206.html"><b>Damage Rates</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We hardly do 10-15% of the total of group damages (if you dont believe me i post you logs). ]</i></font><br><br>Even if true, it only puts the class a few percentage points below an equal contrabution. Of course, equality in damage dealt isn't a goal when in a group. I doubt that a group would expect a bard, for instance, to even do that much damage. Overall it depends on the makeup of a group. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We dont have decent Kunark weapons.]</i></font> <br><br>I guess that's subjective. There's definitely some good paladin weapons out there, and your skill with them is nearly equal to that of a warrior. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We take more xp than others class.]</i></font> <br><br>Depends on what the other classes are. Also remember that race figures into the formula as well. Anyone who groups with an ogre or troll warrior shouldn't disparage, for instance, a human paladin. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We are not done for decent pulling.]</i></font> <br><br>But you can certainly take damage, decrease the groups downtime, and perhaps you also have a good reputation and personality, which are the primary factors that determine who gets into a group. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Or yeah i forgot, we will probably get invited because we can cast daring with our wonderfull DW helm each 11 sec ? A mob level 42+ doubles hits you for 120, daring is so usefull.]</i></font> <br><br>Let's not argue this any more. I think that it's obvious that the spell wasn't meant to be a combat healing spell. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063209.html"><b>Good Decisions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Kudos to Verant for the resurecction improvement and the drag only command (although I'd have rather seen it as an extra command not a replacement). These are both good decisions, and ones that came from user feedback, including mine.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for the note. This is the first post I've seen where someone noticed that he resurrection problem had been fixed to the level that was suggested. Not only do we keep experience from being lost until you agree to the Res, but we also tell you who's casting it and what they are casting. Both of those were as suggested. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: BTW, I'm sure Abashi is working on the "say no now, say yes later" communication issue, but don't beat him up for this, it's a lot better hfor him to change his position to the right one than to stick with the wrong position just to avoid changing his position!]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by "say no now, say yes later", are you referring to the dragging, or where the resurrection issue wasn't considered a bug? Our "Vision" must be somewhat flexible due to constant changes and new content that's put into the game. There's only a relatively small number of issues that we are absolutely firm on. The others take the form of there being "no short term plan" to implement a particular item. <br><br>We don't like to tie our hands by completely ruling issues out too often.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062782.html"><b>Monk Damage Rate</b></a><br>There's no problem with the amount of damage being done by monks at this time. Though a flying kick of 3 points of damage does sound a little strange, raising the minimum damage would only increase the damage output of the monk overall, which isn't warranted at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062772.html"><b>New Spell Messages</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ok..so instead of the rat saying hit by non-melee for xxx dmg..it now states a rat is hit by non-melee for xxx dmg...big deal..]</i></font> <br><br>Well it was something that people were complaining about for some time. I did however get an email from a Game mag editor who felt we should have left it is, as it was "practically an institution." <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: and now the message is in blue..do you realize how hard that is to see? change it back to white please..]</i></font> <br><br>Sorry about that. The one programmer likes that dark blue color. I've personally only found it visible in Everfrost and Oasis/Ro. I'll talk to him.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062743.html"><b>Melee Weapon Specialization</b></a><br>Actually this has been ruled out. Melee types are already as good with their swords as they need to be from a balance perspective. If we were going to implement this, we'd have to reduce their current effectiveness just to give the specialization something to do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062764.html"><b>Dungeon Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We can't "do" dungeons if they are full.]</i></font> <br><br>Yeah, we know. Try some of the Kunark dungeons which were built to encourage people to move through them. Of course we can't stop people from camping entirely should they choose to do that. Luckily there are dungeons that people don't camp. Perhaps you could try some of those.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062739.html"><b>Changing the Burning Rapier Picture</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just wondering if it would be possible for you guys to change the burning rapier graphic so that it actually burns or something. I just finished this long quest & although I like the weapon I would have expected, that for a quest item that takes this long & is this hard to get (at least for me), that it would be burning.]</i></font> <br><br>That would be cool, but we probably wouldn't attach a particle effect to a weapon of that caliber. Particle effects are reserved for the really nifty items. You should start seeing more of them show up in the game in the near future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061819-2.html"><b>Enchanters in PvP</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: please, you have nerfed enchanters in PvP so badly that I now have to run from fights because players have such good resistance gear at lvl's 40+ that I cant even touch a "green" con....It's really making this game no fun.]</i></font> <br><br>The classes in PvP weren't setup so that they'd be equal. Perhaps you might not stand a chance in one-on-one combat in PvP (I'm not an experienced enchanter). *Someone*, or some class in this case has to be at the bottom of the heap for certain situations.

A few moments ago, Gordon created the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063240.html">following thread</a> on the Gameplay Board concerning Pets and Invibility:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>I've noticed a number of threads inquiring into the change to invisibility made in the patch. I thought I'd consolodate the issue and discuss it here.<br><br>First, I'd like to state that the change does not keep pets from casting invisibility on themselves, so the magician air pets will still be able to do their thing.<br><br>Now, the change was made due to the way spells interact on NPCs. Basically, by going through a series of steps, people were able to make their pets permanently invisible. On the PvP servers, this created a huge issue where people being attacked couldn't figure out what was going on. On the "normal" servers, people were charming creatures, making them permanently invisible, then releasing them into the zone. I'm sure you are aware of the problems that a few invisible sand giants can cause. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon announced some big changes to the /consent system in a post made at 12:07am this morning <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062897.html">on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>Many people have suggested over the past few months that we should implement a version of the /consent command to give people the option to drag a corpse (via /corpse) rather than loot it, due to the amount of item theft that takes place. As you know, we previously ruled out such an option for various reasons, not the least of which were technical limitations.<br><br>After considering issue for some time, and taking into account the customer-service issues created by those who loot corpses and steal items under the guise of /consent, we've decided that a change to its operation is warranted. In the next patch, /consent will be changed to give permission to drag the corpse only, not to loot it. Other people will not be able to loot your corpse. <br><br>Though we realize that some will miss the ability to /consent in the previous fashion, the proliferation of NODROP items in game has made asking someone else to loot your corpse a very infrequent event. Given the ability to do one or the other, consent for loot, or consent for drag, we believe that most people would prefer the option to /consent for drag.<br><br>We hope that this change will address everyone's concerns by eliminating the amount of antisocial conduct that surrounds corpse looting.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

In regards to last night's server outage, Gordon Wrinn made the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062824.html">following post on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>We apologize for this evening's outage. We've located the problem and the operations team is working to resolve it now. A problem with the patch was causing inappropriate items to drop across many servers and zones, and also caused some high end loot to be gotten via the forage skill.<br><br>As a result of this outage, we are currently repatching. This puts us about 2 to 4 hours before the servers will be back up. <br><br>As part of this repatch, spells will be redone thus fixing the Jolt spell which had reverted to its old casting time, and the Howling Harpoon will be fixed as it was procing Dragon Breath. Furthermore, a bug with haste items, which caused the highest-end ones (from the Plane of Sky) to be only as good as your average dragon loot has been fixed. Finally, the bug that causes you to lose invisibility (even though it appears to still be up) when someone casts a beneficial spell upon you has been fixed.<br><br>Again, I apologize for the outage and thank you for your understanding.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon made the following announcement on the Gameplay Board late last night:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>We had a problem with our spell database earlier this week, necessitating restoring it from backup. This caused a few things made in the week or so before that to revert to their old state. We went through the changes that we made and *thought* that we caught all of them.

Yes, the servers are definitely down.  Rob sent me the following report which helps shed some light on the reason why:<BLOCKQUOTE>FYI:<br><br>The servers are back down because the drop tables were broken.  They<br>were taken down about five minutes after I /petitioned this in game, but<br>others probably did as well so I doubt the servers being down is my<br>fault alone.

I spotted the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062795.html">following thread</a> was spotted on the Gameplay Board that talked a little about the recent DoT changes and the Cleric's Celestial Elixer:<UL>Abashi will that dot change affect the clerics Celestial Elixer<br><br>You know the one that regens 250 hp a tick for 4 ticks.<br>It shouldn't after all this spell is MEANT to be cast during combat.<br><br><b><i>This is actually a regen spell, so yes it would be affected. I think that this spell is probably hit harder than any of the others in the mix. I might suggest changing it or seeing if we can hardcode this particular spell to work.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>
