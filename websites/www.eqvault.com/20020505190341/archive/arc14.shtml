A man on a horse in a tunnel in Sol B won't cut it. <br><br>When you die does the horse die too? <br><br>Once you buy the horse can you ever dismount and feel the grass between your toes? <br><br>Just wondering. <br><br>Ok that's all for now. </b><br><br>Most likely horses will not be allowed to function indoors. There are just too many situations that could make problematic for horses indoors, not the least of which might be stuffing the rider into the roof of a low ceiling. They will probably disappear when you zone into an indoor location. <br><br>When you die the horse will probably disappear. He will also probably disappear when you dismount, but you will indeed be able to dismount. You'll be able to 'call' your horse back when you need it (which will also cause you to mount the horse). <br><br>Palmetris wrote:<br> <br><b>I was just wondering if horses can be mounted anywhere in the world or just on Luclin. </b><br><br>If you purchase Shadows of Luclin then you will be able to ride your horse in any outdoor zone, old world or new. However, those that do not have Luclin and all the new graphics it includes (as well as those that own Shadows of Luclin but choose to disable the new graphics) will not see your horse.

I also wanted to respond to those that had thought that the horses in some of the earlier screen shots looked a little odd. We had noticed that and had fixed them up just about the time that those shots came out (remember, print magazines have to get these shots a while before the magazine hits the stands). I'm sure you'll be seeing more horse shots before too long, and you'll be able to see the difference. I must say, I was impressed with the very detailed diagram sent in detailing horse anatomy&#8230; I'm sorry that I can't find the diagram or the name of the person that sent it in.

It is very complicated and expensive to try to conform to the legal requirements for sweepstakes in all the different national and state jurisdictions.

Let's repeat that for emphasis:<br><br>We will be wiping characters when we take the server Live (which we hope to do in a few weeks).<br><br>Keeping that in mind, we want to encourage you to log into the server and play for a while.

The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000352.html">relaunch of the official EverQuest website</a> was the subject of one of Alan's latest posts:<UL>I'm sure by now you've already seen the revamp of EverQuest.com.<br><br>One of the things I do here is try to keep my nose into the web development for EverQuest.com. We have some very talented web people and some fantastic artists working on the site. I know this because they're smart enough to ignore most of my ideas&#8230; :)<br><br>We'd really like to get some of your comments and suggestions about the site. But before you send in your comments, let me try to explain what it is that the new site is designed to do and a little of the logic behind how we're trying to do it.<br><br>When someone hears about EverQuest from their friends and is curious to learn more about the game, the first thing they are most likely to do when they get to their computer is to type www.everquest.com into their browser. We want those new potential customers to be able to learn the basics about the game without the clutter and complication of the stuff that experienced players are interested in.<br><br>Those of you that post to and read the Developer's Corner are probably familiar with the old EverQuest.com. That site basically caters to the experienced player, it's where we talk about new features, gameplay and stuff like that. A lot of that information isn't really useful to a potential new customer. When I want to learn about a game, I want to see screenshots, I want to get a feel for it. That's what we're trying to achieve with EverQuest.com. I've read comments on the net suggesting that it is just a marketing site now. That's almost true. We certainly want it to be appealing to potential players without blasting them with complicated concepts like melee balance changes when they just want to see if they are interested in the game at all. We do indeed want to sell the game to potential players through EverQuest.com.<br><br>So we renamed the old EverQuest.com site, it is now EverQuest Live. For those of you that are experienced EverQuest players, EverQuest Live is probably the site you want to bookmark (<a href="http://www.everquestlive.com">www.everquestlive.com</a>).<br><br>We're not done fiddling with the web site. I guess with an ongoing project like EverQuest we'll probably never be done adding things to the site. The web development folks have some really great ideas for the future of the site. But before we roll forward with new changes, we'd like to hear your comments about the changes we just made. So please reply to this thread with any comments or suggestions and I'll make certain that the web team sees them.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Alan</UL>

The changes that took place Monday are still being talked about and clarified.  In the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000340.html">following excerpt</a> Alan addresses Aelfgar's concerns:<UL><b>I am still just a little confused... maybe you can clarify this. From what I have read, the change in resistance it two-fold: first, casters over 51 have a better chance of landing DD's on any mob; and second, certain high level mobs have either had their resistances lowered, or made more specific, so they will have high resistance to certain kinds of spells only... is that correct? If it is, I haven't really noticed the first change yet (dd's seem to be hitting Spiders in VL about the same (3/5th of the time full, 1/5 full resist, 1/5 partial resist), and Spirocs and Raptors in Timorous Deep seem to be on par with this too. I haven't had the chance to try out any uber mobs though... in the next couple of days I will have a chance to try it on Venril Sathir, though, hehe.<br><br>Aelfgar Raintree<br>Level 52 Channeler of Morrel-Thule</b><br><br>The reduced resistances will be more noticeable the higher level the NPC is. You might not see a dramatic change until you try out some of those 'uber' encounters. That's where the problem with resistances existed, not with the lower level NPCs.<br><br>I urge you all to read over the comments we've provided carefully before submitting questions. We tried very hard to explain all this as clearly as we can. The answers to most of the questions I am getting have been given already.<br><br>Alan</UL>

Alan VanCouvering <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000348.html">unleashed some important news</a> on the Developer's Corner.  Catch the full story here:<UL>In the next month or so, prior to the release of EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin, we will be moving to DirectX 8. This will be true not just for those purchasing Shadows of Luclin, but for everyone playing EverQuest. <br><br>In fact, some time soon, prior to the new interface rollout, we will be giving everyone the DirectX 8 version of the graphics engine dll. This will give players the option of using the new dll to help us find any hardware incompatibilities prior to the time we move to DirectX 8 game-wide. We'll be testing as many configurations as we possibly can in-house, but with the huge number of possible hardware configurations we can't test them all. The plan here is to nail the problems down now and have as many of you updated to DirectX8 as soon as we can before we make the switchover. <br><br>Why are we doing this? Well, you'll need it to use the new interface and we need it for all of the good things it lets us do for the game, primarily improving framerates (yes, even in the old world and even if you don't buy Shadows of Luclin). For a good idea of the new features we'll be able to implement with DirectX 8, check out our latest <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/main/indev.jsp">In Development</a> (the EVERQUEST TECH DOCUMENT at the bottom). <br><br>Upgrading to DirectX 8 is pretty simple. Here's what you do: <br><br>1) Download DirectX 8.0a. Store it in a directory so you can find it when you need it in a few minutes, <b>but don't install it yet</b>. You can find them on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp">Microsoft's site</a>. Make certain to get the driver that is appropriate for your operating system. <br><br>2) Locate the most recent drivers for you video card and download them into the same folder (this makes them easier to find). Don't install these yet either. <b>Do this even if you have the latest drivers installed</b>. If they have a text file with installation instructions, you might want to get that too (or print it out). <br><br>3) Locate the most recent drivers for you sound card and download them into the same folder. Again, <b>don't install these yet</b>, and go ahead and download them even if you have the latest drivers installed. You might also want to get any installation instructions for the drivers. You're going to need to reinstall them shortly, so it's best to have them on hand. <br><br>4) Set your video adapter to the Standard Display Adapter (VGA)<br>The steps required to do this will probably vary for each of you a little bit. But here are the steps I followed to change this on my computer <b>(keep in mind that I am using Win 98 and the procedure will be different if you're using Win 2k or XP)</b>:<br>a) Click Start, then Settings, then Control Panel.<br>b) Double Click on Display<br>c) Click on the Settings Tab. Then click on the Advanced Button.<br>d) Click on the Adapter Tab, then choose Change.<br>e) Click Next.<br>f) Select the radial button (the little circle) next to the option for Display a list of all drivers and click Next.<br>g) Select the button next to the option for Show all hardware.<br>h) Scroll to the top of the list and select (standard display types). Then from the window on the right choose standard display adapter (VGA) and click Next.<br>i) It will ask you if you really, really want to use this adapter. Choose yes. <br><br>5) Now install DirectX 8.0a by finding it in your folder and double clicking it. Follow the instructions for installation. <br><br>6) NOW you need to reinstall your video drivers. Use the new ones that you saved in that folder. Follow the instructions for installation given by the manufacturer. <br><br>7) Install the latest sound drivers for you sound card, also following the instructions given by the manufacturer. <br><br>That should be it. You may want to reboot after this if the last driver installation didn't already force you to do it, just to make sure. <br><br>NOTE: It is important to reinstall the latest video <b>and</b> sound drivers <b>after</b> you install DX 8. <br><br>Yes, if you read that carefully you noticed that I said something about a new interface. We will be releasing a new and impressively customizable interface to all EverQuest players with the release of Shadows of Luclin. I don't have a lot of details for you about the new interface at this time. I can tell you that we think you'll be very impressed with it. The main feature of this new interface will be the customizability that it gives the players. We're still building it, so I can't really elaborate, but there is no doubt in my mind that you'll be impressed, or in the least intrigued. :)<br><br>We wanted to let you know about this as soon as we could to give you as much time as possible to make the upgrade. Please consider updating to DirectX 8.0a as soon as possible. EverQuest runs fine with DirectX 8 now, so you shouldn't see any problems running EverQuest after the update. <br><br>We will be double-checking our audio and video support page to make certain that it is up to date. If you need help with audio or video problems, including finding a driver for your cards and identifying your cards, check out our <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/audio_video/index.jsp">Audio and Video Support</a> page. <br><br>Alan</UL>

Chrysania Kiga'rasku brings us word of the demise of the Brethren of the Mystic Dawn guild:<BLOCKQUOTE>I look out my office window on the courtyard below.  The wind gently moves<br>leaves in lazy circles, dust lightly coating practice dummies used by the<br>Knights during practice.  Heard only in the mind, the footsteps of many<br>apprentices, laughter of camaraderie, hushed whispers of students from the<br>Library.  <br><br>I remember the day we came to Highhold.  I remember Knighting ceremonies<br>held on the steps.  I remember glorious battles from the beginning days of<br>Orcs in Crushbone, to the lair of Lady Vox, Lord Nagafen.  We have walked<br>the Planes together with Family and friends.<br><br>We held the BBBB in the Arena, made many many friends. We shared tales of<br>amazing feats and even our share of defeats.  The Brethren became a tight<br>night family.  Together we laughed and cried. I managed to make more then a<br>few of you enjoy good ale.<br><br>Today, as I watch the sun set on the peaks of Highpass, I realize that the<br>Brethren of the Mystic Dawn have also reached their twilight.  It is high<br>time that I take off my mantle of Avatar.  It is time that the Brethren of<br>the Mystic Dawn become a part of History.<br><br>The Brethren of the Mystic Dawn will close its Headquarters. I shall pack my<br>desk and all in it.  The Library Vaults will be sealed for posterity.  The<br>Members shall be released from their oaths of service.  Come this Saturday<br>the Thirteenth of October, the Brethren Shall no longer walk the realms of<br>Norrath with a badge showing their bind to the Brethren.  <br><br>There are entirely too many to thank for all their aide in the travels we<br>have had across Norrath.  Too many friends to even begin to send thanks and<br>well wishes to that need to be made.  I will leave you all with this.<br><br>Thank you each and every one that has touched our presence in the realms of<br>Norrath.  We shall always remember the friends and the battles.  Fare well<br>and safe journeys to you all.<br><br>Chrysania Kiga'rasku<br>Avatar<br>Brethren of the Mystic Dawn</BLOCKQUOTE>

The melee changes that went into the last patch received some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000346.html">additional clarification</a> from Alan.  Here's the two posts from the Developer's Corner:<UL>Obviously there have been plenty of questions regarding the changes to melee and magic post 50 that we introduced with the last patch. The man with his hands on the pulse of the melee changes is Rich Waters. He was instrumental in figuring out what needed to be done and implementing the needed changes, so it's probably best that he be the one to answer questions about those changes. <br><br><b>Hi there ! <br><br>Just a quick question: <br><br>When i saw the changes, i was very happy to see that my Shadow Knight could more damage at last........But now after playing and reading your reply's to some questions, i notice a flaw in it.....You stated that 2H weapons dmg is increased AFTER 51...But in your comment, that SK and Paladins will move to the same dmg table as the Warrior, you didn't make your self clear if this is from level 1 or level 51.....Fighting a blue con Mob yesterday after the patch made no difference for me....At 43 i still miss most of the time and thats the reason i quit playing my SK.....NOW i read that these table changes are in effect after level 51 ???? <br><br>I think a lott of SK and Paladins will be disappointed in this... </b><br><br>--------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Before level 51, paladins, shadowknights, and bards are all on the same damage table as warriors, and always have been. This patch, we changed it so that they remain on the same table all the way up to level 60. Just to make sure this is clear, here is a list of classes- <br><br>Pre-level 51 there are two damage tables, the "standard table" and the "high damage table"<br><b>1-50 Standard Table</b> - Warrior, Rogue, Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger, Bard<br><b>1-50 High Damage Table</b> - Monk <br><br>Before this patch when characters hit level 51, some of them would move to a higher table. This is how things were prior to this latest melee patch.<br><b>51+ Standard Table</b> - Paladin, Shadowknight, Bard<br><b>51+ High Damage Table</b> - Monk, Warrior, Rogue, Ranger <br><br>With this patch, we added two new totally new damage tables, and moved classes around a bit. Here is how things are on live servers right now-<br><b>51+ Standard Table</b> - No one.<br><b>51+ High Damage Table</b> - Warrior, Rogue, Ranger, Paladin, Shadowknight, Bard<br><b>55+ Monk Table</b> - Monk<br><b>60+ Monk Table</b> - Monk <br><br>Also, please note that damage tables are not always a big damage increase. Moving from the standard table to the high damage table is a fairly large increase, but moving from the high damage table to the 55+ monk table is only a small increase. <br><br>Another important thing to know about damage tables is this - they only affect the amount of damage you do. Damage tables do not affect the chance to hit or miss a monster, your weapon skills, or anything except the amount of damage you do. Damage tables specifically affect your average damage per hit and how high your hardest hits can be. <br>--------------------------------------<br><br><b>Ummm, So basicly what it said is that SK and Paladins move to the warrion table from level 1 on. It doesn't say anything about from level 51 ? And isn't it a bit strange that before level 51 i do only 50% of a warrior's damage ? Why don't give us BEFORE level 51 the same damage table ? That would balance the SK and Paladins for real.....even at 43 a warrior is always picked before a SK and a paladin (beter yet a Paladin is picked BEFORE a SK always since the can heal !) <br><br>There would be nothing unbalacing to this if SK and Paladins would be at 75% damage from level 1 upward to level 60 ? Can you at least think about this ? <br><br>Gravel Blacksoul,<br>Human Knight of Bertoxxulous. </b><br><br>--------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>The reason that these changes all took place from level 51 and up, is because we feel that the game and classes are well balanced from levels 1-50 and have been for a long time now. From level 1-50, knight classes do the right amount of damage and have an appropriate amount of other skills and abilities to balance them out against other classes. Even in the low 50s, the classes stay relatively balanced. It's only as they pass 55th level that things were getting unbalanced, so that is where we targeted our changes. <br><br>Also, saying a shadowknight only does half as much damage as a warrior pre-50 is not very accurate. If you compare a shadowknight and a warrior with similar quality gear in those levels, you will find it's much closer than that - even before you include your pet and the spell damage you can do. Shadowknights have always been a very viable class, and now don't suffer from a lack of melee damage at the highest levels. <br><br>One of our main goals with this patch was to bring melee classes at 60th level back to the relative balance they had at level 50. I think we've done this, and that you will find the results quite balanced once you have some time to get used to things again. <br><br>- Rich Waters <br>--------------------------------------<br><br>Thanks Rich. <br><br>Alan</UL>A little later Alan added this to the thread:<UL>I have a little more information for you: <br><br><b>I believe you guys did a great job with the upgrading, however I do feel you fell short in one spot. Paladin and Shadow Knight epics seem to have been effectivly killed in this patch. <br><br>I play a shadow knight I have my epic and personally I felt sick to my stomach. <br><br>Innoruuk's curse is possibly one of the most long involved epics you can do, based on rare drops of rare spawns and visits to all three planes. <br><br>I can understand not changing the epic prowess of Rogue/Ranger etc epics due to the damage they dealt with dual wield. However, because of the old combat system the shadow knight and paladin epics fell far behind the others in "epic" status. Now with the new upgraded 2handers and 1handers most of the sentiment I am feeling from my community is. "Why bother?" "Why did I even bother my EPIC weapon is now a decoration." <br><br>Truely I feel an epic weapon should take back seat to drops in zones such as Temple of Veeshan or Sleeper's tomb, but I feel a small upgrade to the epics themselves would make them desirable again, they are epic aren't they? </b><br><br>--------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Far from killing the effectiveness of knight epics, we actually improved the damage they do by a large amount. This seems to be a common misconception with the new melee patch, and one that's important to clear up. This question is really more about the quality of two-handed weapons than it is about paladins and shadowknights, but it's important since they have two-handed epics. <br><br>When we decided to upgrade two-handed weapons, we looked at both the formula we were using to calculate damage, and also the two-handed weapons available to players. When we looked at epics in particular, we took the amount of damage a warrior would do if he was dual wielding his epic sword pair. Our research showed that this was a good, balanced amount of damage for an epic weapon, so we used it as a basis for comparing the other epics. <br><br>We applied this information to tune our two-handed damage formula, until we were happy with the amount of damage a shadowknight or a paladin was doing with his epic, when compared to the dual epic wielding warrior. The result was an increase in damage done with the knight epics, without needing to change the damage/delay stats on them. You should see that you are doing significantly more damage now with your two-handed epic than you were before the patch, and this increases the closer you get to level 60. Epics did not need their damage/delay stats changed, because they are doing appropriate damage with just the new two-handed damage formula we implemented. <br><br>You've probably read by now that a few very powerful two-handed weapons had their damage/delay stats improved this patch. The reason for this is pretty simple: post-epic quality one-handed weapons were available that had much better damage/delay stats than epic weapons, but the two-handed weapons available after epics did not improve much. For example, if we made a one-handed sword that did 20% more damage than a warrior epic, we should include two-handed swords that do 20% more damage than a SK epic to keep things balanced. So, some of the very rare and powerful two-handed weapons in the game got a boost in stats, to put them on par with the one-handed weapons available in the same areas. <br>--------------------------------------<br><br><b>Also I'm curious as to how this Damage Bonus system works.<br>Paladin epic has 40 delay w/ 23 damage bonus <br>Innoruuk's Cuse has 45 delay w/ 24 damage bonus <br>Nature's Defender is 46 delay w/ 29 damage bonus <br>what am I missing here? <br><br>Anyways thanks for the upgrades even if you don't boost epic prowess I feel you did a good job. <br><br>Zerous </b><br><br>--------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I'll go over damage bonuses more fully in another post, but here's the answer to this question. Damage bonuses are based on the delay of the weapon and the level of the person using it. The damage bonuses you listed were not all from the same level character. At level 60, those weapons actually have these damage bonuses listed on them- <br><br>Fiery Defender (40 delay) 23 point damage bonus<br>Innoruuk's Curse (45 delay) 27 point damage bonus<br>Nature's Defender (46 delay) 29 point damage bonus <br><br>You can see that weapons with larger delays also gain larger damage bonuses. <br><br>- Rich Waters <br>--------------------------------------<br><br>Thanks for your questions Zerous, and thanks for the answers Rich. <br><br>Alan</UL>

Alan add this update to the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000340.html">Combat and Spell System Enchancement</a> thread on the Developer's Corner:<UL>Elans_corpse0 wrote: <br><br><b>I read in your latest response that none of the global resist changes have any effect for damage over time spells. <br><br>Perhaps I am missing something, but it seems that the Necromancer class is largely left out from these beneficial changes since 90% of their offensive spells are DoT. Can you help me out here and show me what I'm missing? </b><br><br>Sure. <br><br>All high level casters have benefited rather dramatically from the change to magic that we made, even if they don't primarily cast direct damage spells. <br><br>We made several changes, reducing the resistance of high level NPCs to direct damage spells was just one of them. We also reduced resistances in general for many of those high level NPCs, making it so that all sorts of spells will land more easily. Let me isolate the important paragraph for you here: <br><br><i>NPCs now have less of a chance to resist any direct damage spell caused by casters above level 50. Super-high level NPCs have received a large reduction in the level-difference bonus they receive to their resists based upon the level of the attacking player character. <b>We&#8217;ve increased the effectiveness of resist debuffs against a large number of higher level NPCs in regard to damage spells being cast upon them. We&#8217;ve also reduced the resistances on a wide range of NPCs, especially for NPCs in Velious.</b> Finally, we&#8217;ve given our designers more control over the ability to customize any particular encounter. For example previously, if a designer didn&#8217;t want a creature to be mesmerisable, he had to give it high magic resistance. Now they can set that feature individually while keeping magic resists reasonable so they don&#8217;t take a bunch of classes out of the picture through the need for one feature. </i><br><br>Overall, from reading the class-specific boards, I think all casters are seeing how useful this change has been for them. You might want to dig up the URL for a necromancer site and see what your fellow gravediggers think&#8230; :)<br><br>Alan</UL>
