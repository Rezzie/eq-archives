Gordon was up again late last night answering more posts on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044491.html"><b>More Ranger Discussion</b></a><br>Elderan, <br><br>We can sit here and throw each others words at each other over and over again, but the end result is the same. You yourself talk about how you cleared all of those dungeons with your group, which you couldn't do if you were the dead weight you mention that you are. <br><br>richard-rhal makes some very good points where he comments (paraphrasing) that one cannot properly judge what it means to be a level 60 ranger over the course of a few days. I'm not at all putting down your skills as a ranger. I'm saying that it takes more time for *anyone* to adjust. <br><br>EverQuest is primarily a group game, and the full power of a class is determined when all members of a group are operating at peak efficiency. I don't think that you can honestly that you gave it a fair shot. I also think that you went in hunting for problems and as such are having problems seeing the benefits because all you wanted to look for was problems. <br><br>It's clear that there's no way I can convince you that your class isn't broken, so I'm not going to discuss the issue further. I sincerely do wish that there was some amicable ground that we could reach, but we absolutely cannot make upgrades to a class where they are not needed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044559.html"><b>It's So Unfair!</b></a><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon, <br><br>There are several issues that you need to be made aware of. In the interest of game-balance I would like you to look into the following: <br><br>1. My chair at work is made from some type of imitation, leather-like, plastic substance while my boss's chair is made from the softest, most supple, imported young-calf leather you could imagine. Regardless of the fact that he has been with the company for 27 years and I am a newbie I demand that my chair be upgraded or his chair nerfed so our seating conditions are equal. <br><br>2. While I am at work I usually spend 90% - 95% of my time reading various Everquest message boards in anticipation of actually playing when I get home. Due to this my eyes are under a terrible strain and sometimes when I get home I can only manage to play Everquest for 9 or 10 hours before it is time for me to be late for work. This is unacceptable. There are two possible fixes for this: Either enhance/replace my eyes or enhance my job so that I am payed for staying at home. <br><br>3. My roommate's puppy crapped on my carpet. Every time I tried to kill it I almost died myself. Now, the puppy cons green to me and it is extremely unfair for a pet to be stronger than me. The only logical solution is to nerf the hell out of the puppy or make me better at melee. <br><br>4. I recently ran some errands for my neighbor who is an invalid. I ran all over town collecting various items for her which took the better part of a day. Upon returning and giving her the items all she gave me was a "Thank You" and an offer of some cookies. No experience for this quest? No money or loot other than cookies? I was infuriated so I killed the old bag figuring I could handle the minor faction loss and would recieve some good experience. Next thing I know I'm KOS in my city and I have all of the guards looking for me. This doesn't make any sense. I kill one old lady NPC and I'm KOS in Miami? I would like my faction back even though the old woman never respawned. I have tried to restore my faction in Miami by killing drug dealers and pimps but I am still KoS to the police/guards. <br><br>Thank You]</i><br><br>ACK! My chair! <br><br>Thanks for the laugh guys <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044446.html"><b>Different Colors in Armor</b></a><br>Given the way that color palettes work, you can't tint something white, as white is a lack of color, except in the cases of light where white is all colors, but lets keep the focus on pigment colors at present. The generic steel armor is as "lacking color" as those particular textures can get. There's no way to remove more color from those textures, you can only add color to them by tinting. <br><br>Creating armor that "looks" white would require building new skins for all of the races that can wear it, and those new skins would have to be loaded in the Global, which doesn't have room given texture memory limitations of old Voodoo1 cards.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044439.html"><b>Gordon the Tireless</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Concordance News<br><br>The issues noted in the original post have been fixed on the Test Server. Most of it will go live on Monday as we patch zones, some of it requires an update to items, which will probably happen next week.<br>**********************************************<br>The above is a quote from Gordon regarding when a fix is going in, taken from EQVault.com. Notice the day he says...MONDAY !! That is Memorial Day..a National holiday.]</i> <br><br>Easy there. Please note the day the original quote was written versus what day it ends up on the news sites. I wrote that sometime over the weekend. By "Monday" I was speaking of *Today*.  <i>(Note from Aurum: And by "Today" he meant yesterday, since he posted it late, late last night.  Some of us mere mortals have this weird habit called 'sleeping' which is why it didn't end up in the news until today. :))</i><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043354-2.html"><b>Who at Verant has played a Wizard?</b></a><br>A common theme here on the boards is something along the lines of "If only someone at Verant played a [insert class here], then they'd see what we mean." The truth is that we have people here who play the game as religiously as some of the players, and every class is represented. <br><br>The next comment that is usually made is that we twink our characters and play with GM powers. We don't. It's not fun and there's no point to it. Playing EQ with "powers" is roughly equivalent to playing an FPS game in "god mode". It gets old really quick, hence our firm stance that challenge is necessary in order for a game to be fun. <br><br>I can understand how people might think that there is some "if only" condition that would lead to instant agreement on all of the issues, but there really isn't. We form our opinions based upon our desires for the game, our personal experiences, and feedback received from the players. As much as we'd like it to be so, sometime our decisions are not what everyone wants to hear. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041000-8.html"><b>VenrilSathir Faction in Kunark Dungeons - Part 3</b></a><br>It's not being ignored per se, I just didn't have anything new to say on the issue. <br><br>Given time for the faction issue to sink in, it appears that people are starting to learn how it works and deciding on their own whether or not they want to maintain the faction. <br><br>It's not unusual for people to violently oppose a change that they view will have some negative consequences when we first make or propose it. However usually, given time to get used to the idea, many learn to accept or even like it. This faction issue is very much a situation like that, a resistance to change. But games of this nature *must* change in order to remain interesting and challenging. <br><br>The 3 dungeons will continue affecting the Venril Sathir, and the evil outpost will likewise remain on this faction. I do apologize to anyone who finds this unacceptable and ask that give it another chance.</UL>

Included in this news post are two reports sent to me concerning recent changes to the game.  Here's the first report from Kurss:<BLOCKQUOTE>There were SIGNIFICANT changes to most Kunark zones and Timorous Deep last <br>night.  If you remember seeing a message about a particular zone going down, <br>then that zone was changed in one of three ways:<br><br>1.  Factions were changed.  This happened in Timorous Deep.  Everything <br>there hates Iksar now.  (And the ogres are going to die for their <br>foolishness now that they actually hate me. :))<br><br>2.  Loot tables were modified.  Keep your fingers crossed, I think the loot <br>tables have been adjusted so that our monsters no longer drop minimal <br>treasure.<br><br>3. Experience modifiers were upgraded.  Apparently, many Kunark zones had a <br>too-low experience modifier associated with them.  The word is that the <br>experience in several areas has been significantly increased.<br><br>It is possible that other changes were made, but these three seem to be the <br>big ones, with faction changes being the most dangerous.<br><br>Kurss<br>GM Scaled Souls</BLOCKQUOTE>Here's report #2 from Mekis:<BLOCKQUOTE><br>FYI Folks:<br><br>The Timourous Deep has been itemized, and factions have been adjusted (or<br>corrected to the way they were meant to be).  We had a guild group there<br>yesterday WHEN it happened last night around 9pm EST. The zone "crashed"<br>WITHOUT warning. When we logged back in, we found ourselves under attack by<br>the ogres immediately. A few people died, everyone who couldn't feign death.<br><br>Eventually our GM came and provided resses since we didn't get any kind of<br>warning, and everything turned out good. We witnessed a few other people die<br>as they logged in as well. So be carefull, they will aggro and they will mob<br>you...<br><br>Oh, the faction hit on the ogres is "Venril" something...good luck.<br><br>Mekis Manslayer<br>L22 Monk<br>Cazic Thule's Chosen<br>Torvonillious</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks guys!

Gordon's posting up a storm on the Gameplay Board tonight.  Since the first infobit post he has responded and posted even more.  Here are the latest quotes and excerpts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044429.html"><b>Spell Gems: The Coloring</b></a><br>Thanks for reminding me, I'll go remind him that I sent it. He was out of the office for nearly 3 weeks and came back to find over 500 emails waiting for him.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044433.html"><b>Is Cann2 Quest in now? </b></a><br>Yes, it should be in now.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044427.html"><b>Do Spectres talk or am I hallucinating again?</b></a><br>I'm surpised someone didn't point this out sooner :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044431.html"><b>Another Hacker Scam?</b></a><br>The StationID field just stores the name of the last person to log into the account from your computer. It's stored locally in a text-file (EQUname.txt). The only way what you explain could happen is if we sent that file down as a patch (we didn't) or if someone else tried to log in on your system, or someone manually edited the file or sent it to your computer across the network. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044420.html"><b>Are we going to get free accounts for star wars or pay and extra 10 bucks? </b></a><br>It's still too soon for us to comment on pricing plans at this time. We'll be sure to announce the information as soon as we are able.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044421.html"><b>Names, Names and More Names</b></a><br>We set up the alternate class-names as a benefit or a reward per se for those who got up to the higher levels. I'm sure that your suggestion would be neat and well-received, but we wouldn't want to cheapen the reward to the higher level folks. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044422.html"><b>More on Spell Drops</b></a><br>No, we're still looking at the issue but we're leaning in the direction of it being ok as it is. We really don't want them to become so common that we get to the point that that it isn't a big deal and we might as well put them on the vendors. <br><br>The core spells for each class is sold on vendors. The dropped and quested spells are pretty much for flavor. I realize that the previous way spells were done made them appear as an entitlement, but we're checking out the idea of making them like cool loot items. <br><br>We'll keep an eye on it for a while and run some reports and let you know if anything is changing. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043953.html"><b>Why is there no music in Kunark?</b></a><br>We'll be patching music files for all zones that currently do not have them in the near future. This will enable swiming, combat, and boat music. It will however probably be a while before we get some "mood" music assigned, and even then we'll be limited to the music that's currently in game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041691-2.html"><b>Is the Shackle of Rock doable?</b></a><br>I'm checking into this. I'll try to get back tomorrow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044412.html"><b>Timorous Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Great, I was hunting Raptors then all of a sudden I was kicked out of the game - no warnings whatsoever. The Timorous Deep zone is unavailable. I reconnect and get pounded on by about 4 raptors and a "Dinus". Yes, that's right, they're aggro now. I die in about 2 seconds, as I didn't even have gate memorized before.]</i> <br><br>NPCs, their relations, and statistics change frequently. Nothing can be counted on to remain 100% safe all of the time. In fact we routinely search out conditions that are 100% safe in order to make them a little more risky. <br><br>I am sorry to hear that you may not have been given a warning as to the zone coming down. Any time we bring down a zone intentionally, there should be a warning to that effect. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: At least they gave the Iksars fair warning that their faction would be changed, I'd have appreciated the same.]</i> <br><br>The particular nasty critter that you ran into was always part of the zone, and wasn't "put in" to catch people binding there post-production. It just isn't around all the time. <br><br>In other words, there was really nothing to warn about here. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044393.html"><b>Why do GM's not answer their mail?</b></a><br>I'm not sure who you've been emailing or what issue you need assistance with, but you should direct your customer-service related emails to eqmail@verant.com. <br><br>I should also mention given the tone of the posts here that though we understand that people do get upset, and are happy to whatever work we can to get CS issues addressed, we don't ask the GMs to reply to direct insults, flames, or posts laiden with profanity. Please keep your mail to that address civilized and professional.</UL>

An exciting new story has been published in our <a href="/lore/stories">Fan Fiction</a> area entitled <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid959045017,49514,">In The Company Of Woe, Part One</a>.  We would like to thank it's author Lane Boyd for writing this story and allowing us to publish it.  Here is an excerpt from this tale:<UL><i>Faces of soldiers drifted in and out of the mist on the path leading north out Kelethin. Dour men and women returning home silently passed Wigglewood by; others sat in make-shift camps on hillsides and under trees, watching nothing or eating or wiping their weapons clean. The halfling couldn't take time to stare, pressed as he was to keep up with Nyaleen's quick pace further into the Faydark woods. He wasn't doing so well, hampered by chainmail armor that laid over him like a net. She'd given it to him when he arrived in the elven city, but he never wore it. It was heavy. The tunic was bad enough, the leggings pieces and the coif were plain cruel. He slogged over the mossy ground, trying to keep sight of the warrior one hilltop ahead. She moved surpisingly fast in all that metal. <br><br>A howl of pursuit severed Wigglewood's progress as Nyaleen once again disappeared over a crest. A tattered soldier broke from the trees onto the path in front of him. The halfling veered to give the man room to run, but a second figure, then a third and a fourth pierced the veil of mist, each futilely striking out at their elusive quarry. Scrambling to gain ground, they pushed Wigglewood aside. All the halfing saw was black blue fur, vicious teeth, and monstrous arms, hunched as they trampled him, intent on the soldier ahead. </i></UL>Be sure to read this!

The article is up of course in <a href="/lore/shadoe">Shadoe's Corner</a> and anyone who is interested in the topic or original article will find it a great read.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>Then came the reader response mail - droves of them. It took me a solid three-and-a-half-hours of reading to get through them all. I was so overjoyed, I couldn't help but grab one of my co-workers and throttle him until his tongue hung out and his eyes rattled in his skull. (Simmer down, Dave - I know you have good medical coverage.)<br><br>After my mistaken assumption, I can't put to words how grateful I am to you all for writing in. I received mail of support saying "right on," and "I couldn't have said it better myself," by the truckloads. Every single one brought a smile to my face, and my thanks goes out to each of you, bar none. Other letters I received told stories of times they had been killed by a player-killer who actually did roleplay the scene out. All I can say is that your stories were entertaining, inspiring, and I envy each and every one of you with a seething, unending jealousy! I even received a tempting offer by a concerned player named "Yibno" to kill me in a fully roleplayed scene. It's a shame I stopped playing on Rallos Zek...</UL>Thanks Shadoe! :)

Hot off the pages of the Gameplay Board here is today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044376.html"><b>Creating Weapons</b></a><br>One point of order. We don't create our items with random generators. They are all done by hand by the game designers :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044363.html"><b>Relying on Others</b></a><br>Causing characters to rely on other classes or strategies to make the most of their spells doesn't make a spell useless. For instance, you could get someone who has the ability to slow the critter (and hopefully its target) down to give you time to get the spell off. You could jump in and see if you can get off a stun. You could mez both the target and former pet, recharm, and hope your mez breaks before the charm does again. <br><br>There are many strategies available to you, which is one of the things that makes enchanters so cool.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044277.html"><b>The Lumberjack's Cap</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anytime someone in a zone 1)Loots one, 2)Auctions on being for sale, 3)Auctions wanting to buy one, 6)Inspects someone and notices they are wearing one, or 42)Remembers they themselves are wearing one, a lone shout (that will quickly bring about the crashing of the zone as assuredly as something that always happens) doth ensue: I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK......." ]</i><br><br>ACK! I'll bring the issue to the attention of the nerfing team, errrrr, tuning team at once! :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044252.html"><b>Fishing Facelift Thread Closed</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: BOO!!! Abashi closed the thread.]</i> <br><br>The thread got too large. The UBB script starts choking when thread size gets too large. When that happens, the guys who look after the health of the board would just delete the thread causing the problems. I thought I'd close it before that happened. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: C'mon, Abashi.... can we get something a little more than "we will keep them in mind" and a thread closer?]</i><br> <br>Right now we have a huge list of *good* suggestions that we'd like to implement at some time, probably enough to keep 20 people busy for a few years. This is in addition to all the things that need to be done to keep the game running smoothly and keep it interesting. We of course can't implement every suggestion, or even every good suggestion, so sometimes "we'll keep it in mind" is the best response that we can offer.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044232.html"><b>Q&A on Bard Issues</b></a><br>Ok, I've forwarded this to the tuning and live teams and I hope to get back to address everything in a day or two. There are a couple of issues that I'd like to pull out and comment on now though: <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: * Angstlich&#8217;s Appauling Screech (26) - Fear does not interrupt casting.]</i> <br><br>Fear (no matter who its cast by) has never interrupted NPCs who are casting spells. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: * Still missing 49 song- thanks for asking for our input. Lots of good suggestions out there.]</i> <br><br>This probably shouldn't be included in a list of "bugs". One day we might put one in, but we don't have anything planned for this slot at present. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: * Item Switching: No other class switches items as much as bards - period. Bards are constantly switching between instruments because of song requirements or increased effects. Why should the interface be such a pain or cause carpal tunnel?]</i> <br><br>We've spoken about several options including a drop confirmation, and a /command that would make you swap out your items in specific inventory slots. I'm not sure when, or if we will something implemented here, but it's on our whishlist. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: * Any possiblility for a /twistsong ####, where # is the gem #? Would make twisting considerably easier than hitting keys twice every 3 seconds.]</i> <br><br>Probably not. We'd really like to see bards actively played, rather than passivly sitting there after typing one command. The more dexterous the person behind the keyboard is the more benefit that a bard can impart to the party. A person who can compose a song of 3 different melodies and change instruments at the same time is a formidable bard indeed :)<br><br><i>[Quote from original post: * Sing emote. Nice for roleplaying.]</i> <br><br>Possible, but it would be low priority. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: * Magical bard musical instruments give no indication of their effect on the player (+5% String, +20% Percussion, +10% to Brass, etc). It would be nice to either see this info with a right click or when using the identification song.]</i> <br><br>The bonus varies on a per song/per instrument basis. I'd doubt that we could come up with a concise representation, and I'm also not sure that we'd want to. There are other held items in the game that increase the effectiveness of spells and do not specify by how much in their description.<br> <br><i>[Quote from original post: Oversight: Bards are now using mana on 2 songs, but do not get benefits of clarity or mana song. Why are bards the ONLY casting class that do not get mana regeneration benefits?]</i><br> <br>Not an oversight at all. We needed a method to place hard limits on how well, how often, and how long a specific song could be sung. We decided that we didn't want anything to adjust that limit. We have offered to switch DDD to a resing timer (same as a recast timer), but the charm song will remain on mana. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044243.html"><b>Medding in Combat/Taunt Nerf</b></a><br>We haven't changed the way this works since the original AI for sitting was put in. It's not an auto-taunt, and assuming that the warrior-types have done enough damage to the critter they won't necessarily switch to the sitting person. <br><br>I've always thought it was as if the NPC was saying, "How DARE you hurl a fireball in my face and then have the gaul to sit down!!!" :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042725.html"><b>More on New Enchanter Illusions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: What about the Gender Illusion spells??]</i> <br>Actually we are working on something of this nature. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043998.html"><b>Melee Class Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi is the Dev team EVER going to fix the melee class stats? Make em MEAN SOMETHING. They work for NPCs but for PCs the stats are useless. Don't you think it's about time this was fixed?]</i> <br>As both Brad and I have mentioned before, stats matter to varying degrees depending on your class. Some stats matter more than others, and they work as designed. <br><br>We've no plans at present to expand on the use of stats beyond what they currently mean.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043881.html"><b>Resurrection Bug?</b></a><br>I believe I mentioned before that this isn't a bug. Player characters get one chance to accept a resurrection. If they refuse, they can still be transported to the site with a resurrection, but won't get experience.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/027356-3.html"><b>Clerics and Plate</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi are Clerics a Plate wearing class? If yes then why cant we wear any of the following armor items, none of them are "class specific" and in some case's non-plate wearing class's can wear.]</i><br> <br>Being a plate-wearing class isn't supposed to mean that you can wear every piece of plate armor out there. There are still items that are restricted to the melee classes (and yes I'm including the bard in this description, though they're really in a class all their own). You'll notice that even though Shamans can wear chain, they aren't able to wear every piece of chain that rangers or rogues can wear.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039580-11.html"><b>Fishing Facelift</b></a><br>There's a lot of good ideas here, things we can definitely keep in mind. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042514.html"><b>Concordance News</b></a><br>The issues noted in the original post have been fixed on the Test Server.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon made an interesting post on the Gameplay Board in regards to some people complaining about how slow it is to level past 50.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044030.html">the post</a>:<UL><I>There's something that I'm wondering about while reading this thread, and I hope everyone here can help me understand the issues that are at work.<br>When the characters were 50th level, and 50th was the cap, players accepted the fact that they weren't gaining levels and proceeded across the world to adventure and have fun.<br><br>Now that we've raised the cap to 60, people can once again gain experience, levels, etc. Why "struggle" through levels? Why not simply play the game as you were at 50th and let whatever happens, happen? Since you can gain levels, you'll certainly gain them faster than you did when you were 50th and capped. <br><br>I get the impression that there are a number of people who want to "hurry up and get to 60th so they can relax and have fun". Though there might be some worry of being outleveled by your friends, no longer being able to group, that concern doesn't exist from 50th to 60th. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>Here's the second post in this thread:<UL><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Past Mindset. I think people have been in a mindset that you need to be a certain level to do a certain area. There werent many lvl 36's in sol b until the zone was crowded and safe. Most people want to know that their group will survive the first time they go to a place so they level up to make sure they can do it. ]</i><br><br>I have noticed that past-mindset seems to be a driving issue. One thing that we've noticed about the general playerbase is that they tend to fight outdoors until they outclass an area, then move in to fight. In other words, if we've designed a dungeon to be 35-45, the majority of the people in there are 45+. Without putting entrance caps in, which we definitely do not want to do, it would be interesting to debate how this could be addressed. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Perception. As long as verant hides the way the mechanics of eq works people will have their own biases and perceptions. "Oh a lvl 53 just isnt high enough to help us level 59's where we are going." ]</i><br><br>As a general rule, if the lowest-level person in the group is blue to the highest level person, everyone will get experience from a kill. The actual rule is a bit more lenient than that, but that's a rule that will always work. I should also mention that everyone will either get their full share of experience or will get nothing. Basically, if you get the "You have gained experience" message, you have gained all the experience that you are otherwise entitled. In other words, we don't just give you a token amount of experience to make the message show. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: I'll just answer for myself. I play everquest to level. Becoming more powerful is what's fun. Getting new spells is what's fun. If my exp bar isn't moving then I'm wasting time. I'm burnt out on sitting around chatting. ]</i><br><br>That's how some people play the game certainly, and it's a playstyle that we gladly support. These are the people who typically build one character up to max then turn around and build another. For them, the leveling is the "fun" that the game provides. I just got an email today from a gentleman who has 4 character over 50th level, and I would guess that he falls in this playstyle. <br><br>Other playstyles do exist. <br><br>For instance, a common playstyle is the guy who hates to level, but wants to be as powerful as possible, so powers up his character to max and then goes off to have "fun". These are the people who have one high-level, maybe a low-to-mid level secondary, and primarily play their high-level character. <br><br>There are other people for whom the concepts of leveling and power are only a secondary part of the game. They play first to have fun and worry not about maximizing their XP acquisition rate. What this type of gamer and the one above find "fun" are often the same thing, however the one above doesn't begin to have this fun until the character is maxed. We typically don't know what level these people are as they rarely talk about it, and if queried, usually have a higher p-time to level ratio than the other types. <br><br>So, to recap, if I had to place labels on each type of gamer: <br><br>1. The Powerleveler (Leveling is fun)<br>2. The ???? (having trouble coming up with a label) (Doesn't like leveling, thinks adventuring, socializing, and exploration is fun, but can't have that fun until the character is maxed.)<br>3. The Social Gamer (Is not concerned with leveling, and thinks adventuring, socializing, and exploration is fun). <br><br>Note: Let's not confuse this with "The Roleplayer" which really isn't a playstyle in this regard. Most roleplayers would fall under #3, but I have met many 1s and 2s as well. Also, the playstyles aren't firm, but more of a scale that wraps back to #1 after #3. Players do fall in between the different numbers. In addition, there are a couple other less common playstyles, such as the Experimenter, who has a bunch of characters, low-to-mid level. <br><br>Giving levels 51-60 a steep experience requirement should increase enjoyment for those close to a #1, would not affect those close to a #3, and I can see how it might make things difficult for those who tend towards #2. Our assumptions would be that there are more people who have tendencies towards #1 than #2. <br><br>-Gordon</UL>And here's the final post:<UL><i>[Quote from original post: You guys at Verant need to hire psychologists to play the game so that they can predict what players will want. or you can just listen to the people who are telling you what they want. ]</i><br><br>We have at least one person on staff with a degree in psychology, but we also listen to the players to see what they want. Nearly 250K people can have a fairly substantial list of wants though :) And of course, as any psychologist can tell you, what people want isn't necessarily the best thing for them :)</UL>

Ainvar sent me the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings all,<br><br>I have been doing much thinking as to the workings of The Norrathian Senate <br>of the Cazic-Thule Server as of late and I have made some very important <br>conclusions. I would like to call a meeting of all guilds and people of The <br>Norrathian Senate. I would also like to invite guilds and people not <br>affiliated with The Senate to attended. Anyone is welcome to attend and hear <br>what we have to say. We will be discussing a common law that I would like to <br>put into effect. And a new organization of the guilds. This will probably be <br>the last meetings of the entire Senate if all goes well. This meeting will be <br>held just inside the Tunnel to East Commons in Northern Ro on May 23rd at 8pm <br>EST.

The <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo/">Ask Milo</a> column on EverLore was updated today with more wacky views and answers from Milo Cooper.  Here's excerpt from one question centering on a movie soundtrack:<UL>Have you picked up the reissued soundtrack for "Superman: The Movie"? It seems to me that in this new, expanded form, the score is revealed as one of John William's very finest.<br><br>Also, if you saw "Mission to Mars," what did you think of the Ennio Morricone score? Was it just me or did I hear reused cues from "The Thing" at a couple of spots?<br><br>Benjamin Adams <br><br>Milo Says: <b><i><br>John Williams' Superman score was very obviously a nigh flawless masterpiece even before the whole thing was released a few months ago. Almost all of the best cues made it onto the original 1978 vinyl album; the new CD is certainly a blast, but only two or three of the previously unreleased tracks radiate so much as a fraction of the brilliance of stuff like "The Trip to Earth," "Leaving Home," and "Chasing Rockets," and especially "Superfeats," which is just unreal. Superman: the Movie is Williams' second or third greatest score, in my opinion.<br><br>I did see Mission to Mars, but I don't remember a note of the soundtrack.</b></i><br></UL><br>For the rest used the link provided above.

The BBC features a new <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_755000/755614.stm">article on the auction of MMORPG accounts and items</a> in their SCI/TECH section.  While other games are mentioned, EverQuest and the people who sell EQ items and accounts are the heavy focus of this article.  As always, here's the traditional clip: <UL>Some players of popular internet-based games such as Everquest and Ultima Online are cashing in on the time they have invested in the virtual worlds by selling off the characters, magic weapons and even buildings they have collected. <br><br>The virtual items, armour and characters are being offered for sale on auction sites such as eBay. Bids of up to $1,000 are being received for some of the most coveted items. <br><br>But game makers and players are trying to stamp out the practice because having a glut of powerful players is unbalancing the communal games. </UL>Thanks Claes!

The Gaming Age has posted the net's latest <a href="http://cgi.gaming-age.com/gaming/reviews/review.pl?sys=pc&game=everquest">review of The Ruins of Kunark</a>.  The review awards the expansion with a B+ rating.  Here's a clip from the review:<br><UL>After joining the guild the game gets extremely open ended, which is why EverQuest sucks people in. The reason I quit playing MUDs in the first place is how addictive the ability to almost do anything is. For the most part this idea isn&#8217;t that different in EQ, but it can be a bit more limited. Programming different socials, actions, and spells is actually a little more difficult than what MUD Admins used to go through in the past. Now new visual effects and motions need to be created for individual characters. Verant has done a pretty solid job keeping a lot of these options open but it just isn&#8217;t as easy to create an identity. Now forming an identity requires the player to take part in events, help/harm others, in essence stand out from the crowd. This isn&#8217;t a fault, just a definite change in play style. </UL><a href="http://cgi.gaming-age.com/gaming/reviews/review.pl?sys=pc&game=everquest">Click here</a> to read the rest.

Sugan sent me the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>    Sugan searched as much of Faydwer as she could, stopping only to<br>accept the helpful spells of gracious druids. Nothing. She saw not a<br>single Shadow Strider. The redheaded paladin's search covered<br>Butcherblock and Unrest, the forests of Faydark naturally. She even<br>tried venturing into Castle Mistmoore, but was driven back by the<br>Teir'Dal living there.<br>  <br>  The results were there. Seemingly sweeping from night itself, an<br>unknown predator snatched away young wood elves. Taverns were bustling<br>with gossiping bards and the worried parents they catered to, and flyers<br>covered the bulletin boards of every town on the continent. Sugan told<br>all she knew to the elven families, her emotions taxed by the tears of<br>broken mothers. It seemed she only needed mention Shadow Striders for<br>everyone to understand. The words "I'll Do Everything I can" became as<br>dry as the leaves on the beautiful forest's floor. The Feir'Dal felt so<br>small in her human arms, as she comforted them. Sugan could only imagine<br>the delicate frames of their lost children and relatives. Somehow, the<br>vision always portrayed them lifeless...<br>   <br> With a sense of urgency, the paladin left for Freeport again. There<br>was the possibility of finding them before the Festival of Fear, when<br>there would likely be a great number of Teir'Dal and other evils to deal<br>with. It was late one evening that Sugan ventured into the abandoned<br>remains of a Commons land residence. By the warning flags, it had been<br>quarantined as a death camp from the Plague. She was all too familiar<br>with those flags.<br>    <br>Prying the loose boards from a window, Sugan climbed inside and<br>recoiled at the musty decay. There were signs of recent disturbance,<br>obvious enough for someone with no tracking skill to find. She searched<br>about, and in the the corner pulled back a tan cloth. The wall of the<br>house had a rather large hole in it, through which it seemed someone(s)<br>had snuck to avoid disturbing the boards nailed across the door and<br>windows. This wall was so close to the other buildings outside that few<br>would notice. Sugan crawled through the opening but paused with<br>surprise. A shiny object was on the ground directly in front of her. The<br>symbol of her people, the Wind Riders, was clearly engraved on it.<br>   <br> Her heart sank with dread as she tried to follow the trail. Sugan<br>knew the elves had been kept in that death camp, but scolded herself for<br>being too late. And another Wind Rider was to be one of the victims of a<br>terrible game. Festival of Fear, indeed. Night overtook the land as the<br>girl's human eyes searched in vain. Sugan stopped cold at the foot of<br>the great, dark forest called Nektulos...<br><br>Sunday, May 21st - Festival of Fear</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Haemish sent the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Name_Of_Submitter: Haemish MacLennan<br>Event_name: Karana Guildwar - Dark Oracles vs. Silver Daggers<br>Email: <a href="mailto:haemish@mail.com">haemish@mail.com</a><br>Guild_Sponsoring_Event: Silver Daggers & Dark Oracles<br>Date: 05/21/2000<br>Time: 02:00 PM CST<br>Event_Description: On Sunday, May 21 at 2 pm Central time, the allied guilds Silver Daggers and Dark Oracles, <br>both members of the Karana Council of Guilds, will hold a friendly guildwar in the East Commonlands on the Karana Server. Several rules <br>will be in effect for the duration of the war:<br><br>1) No DOT spells. This is due to exp. loss if you die from these spells. <br>2) No using the zone's NPC's in anyway to cause damage to the other side. No<br>training NPC's and no charmed NPC's. Caster pets are allowed. Also, if a zone NPC intereferes, either stop fighting until that<br>threat is dealt with or you take your chances. They will attack anyone involved in one-on-one or any PvP fights, but they<br>won't necessarily aggro on all participants.<br>3) Non-participants must be listed beforehand, so that they are not attacked. Anyone<br>who attacks a non-combatant is disqualified. Also, non-combatants cannot assist with<br>buffs or heals in combats between guilds. <br>4) No bind point or corpse camping. Also, in battles between the guild, one death is all<br>you get. No one can die, get their corpse and rejoin the battle. Everyone is allowed to<br>get their corpse, but no one can reenter the fights. <br>5) No looting. <br>6) No /anon or /roleplay characters. We do this so that each side can know generally what to expect from the other, for<br>forumlating tactics. <br><br>These are some of the type of fights that we've either done or talked about: <br><br>1) Assassin - One player, the target, from the Daggers will be accompanied by a<br>group of 6 members of the Daggers, who are to escort him from one end of the zone<br>to the other, i.e. from Qeynos to Surefall glade. The other guild puts a group of 6 into<br>the zone, with the purpose of killing the target. If they succeed, roles are reversed,<br>and the Oracles have a target to protect. Best 2 out of 3 tries at this. <br><br>2) Group hunts - Each guild has a group of 6 that enter the zone from opposite ends.<br>They are to hunt each other, in what ever way they see fit. Whichever guild has the<br>last man standing wins. We can do multiple groups if we have enough people who<br>want to. <br><br>3) If there are enough members on both sides, we get together for one big<br>Braveheart-esque battle, a huge scrum. I'd love to do this, but it depends on how many participants we have from each side.<br><br>Specatators are welcome, so long as they do not interfere with the battles or give aid to one side or the other. If there is too <br>much chat chatter in that zone, we'll move it to the West Commonlands. <br><br>To WAR!<br><br>Haemish MacLennan<br>Clan Chieftan<br>The Silver Daggers <br><a href=mailto:mailto:haemish@mail.com>haemish@mail.com</a><br><a href="http://silverdaggers.freehosting.net">http://silverdaggers.freehosting.net</a><br><a href="http://go.to/karanacouncil">http://go.to/karanacouncil</a><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/games/DarkOracle">http://www.angelfire.com/games/DarkOracle</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Haemish!

Gordon's been keeping busy on the boards as normal.  Here's the next round of quotes and excerpts straight off the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043616.html"><b>/Loc Issues</b></a><br>/loc is a very artificial, out-of-character, and therefore undesirable method of direction-finding. It was supposed to be taken out when EQ first went live, but as I understand it it was left in due to public opinion. We really wouldn't want to expand on its use in this manner, as it would cause it to become commonplace.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043578.html"><b>The Risk</b></a><br>Every player has the ability to choose what level of risk is palatable to them. Those who choose to take on greater risk should be able to expect greater rewards and less restrictions upon what they can or cannot do. For example, some people are so opposed to risk that they'll only fight in a dungeon if it is crowded and there is no chance of death, while others will run headlong into certain death all for the prospect of the excitement that comes with the battle. <br><br>Experience loss is part of that risk and part of what creates excitement by making character death something that you definitely don't want to happen. <br><br>The death penalty is one of those things that virtually no one likes, yet is part of what makes the game fun and exciting.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043617.html"><b>Use of Triggers in EQ</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: For example you manage to kill the level 50 lords, now, deeper into the dungeon (behind you is great) 5 lvl 45 body guards come running to the scene... lets say it takes them 1 minute to get to the party. This would increase the danger of such a place, would increase the danger of the lord IMMENSELY.. would completely and utterly destroy the idea of 'camping' this guy... and of course, a single death, would be felt by all.]</i> <br><br>We certainly have the ability to do things of this nature. Many people can probably quote a few spawns that do something like this already. It would be really nice in the one-way dungeons though :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043649.html"><b>Account Problems - How do you prove hacking?</b></a><br>I sincerely apologize if you were treated unfairly here, however the security of an account is the responsibility of the owner of the account. In other words, the owner of an account is reponsible for anything anyone does while logged into the account. <br><br>There are a number of people out there perpetuating scams to try and gain access to accounts, and the best thing that we can do is warn people not to give their passwords away, and remind everyone that we will never, in game or otherwise, ask them for their password. Beyond those warnings, each player needs to be actively aware of attempts to get their confidential information.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043668.html"><b>More on Timorous Deep</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Do things like the mobs agro range, "social" qualities, and faction happen before or after the itemization step?]</i> <br><br>Typically yes, then items are created and placed as they fit into the context of the previously laid foundation. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyway, if indeed itemization is the last step for t'deep, ask that team to go back and look again - I think they missed a few things...]</i> <br><br>We'll look at the other issues you've brought up again when the guys are testing the itemization.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043646.html"><b>PoF Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well you fixed the fingers.. but obviously you didn't want to increase the total number of mobs in Plane of Fear. So what did Verant decide to do? Yeah, they removed 4 of the 8 boogeyman spawn.]</i><br> <br>Actually that's not entirely correct. In the Plane of Fear, there are a total number of creatures possible that can spawn. For each one, there is a percentage chance that a given mob will spawn. This means that the number of creatures of a given type that can spawn on a complete repop of the zone varies. For instance, it is possible that 50 boogeymen could spawn, just as it's possible that zero could, but on average it is usually a given number. <br><br>For the purpose of raising the spawn percentages for the frightfingers, we reduced the percentages of Phoboplasms (which can drop any of about 8 different class-inspecific items), not boogeymen. <br></UL>

The <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/indev.html">In Development</a> section of the official EQ page was updated today.  Here's the scoop:<UL><b>Zones</b><br><br>Two new areas tentatively titled The Hole, and The Warrens will be accessible via Paineel and Erudin on Odus. The zones will be free of charge and available via an optional patch. The Hole is a high level dungeon which represents the ruins of Old Paineel, destroyed long ago in a war with between the Erudites and the Heretics. The Warrens is a dungeon for lower level players, and is the original home of the Kobolds upon Norrath. More information regarding these new zones will be made available as their release date nears.<br><br><br>-------------------<br><br><br><b>General Issues</b><br><br>Though a majority of the EverQuest development team's time has been dedicated to creating The Ruins of Kunark expansion, we are now turning our attention to the enhancement of current game play related features, such as dungeon tuning and balancing, and quest implementation.

I'm proud to announce that the <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/askthearchmage/05-19-00.shtml"><b>first edition of Ask the Arch Mage</b></a> has been published!  Ask the Arch Mage is a column where players can submit questions to Verant Interactive's Geoffrey Zatkin.  For those who don't know who GZ is here's a quick bio:<UL><b>Geoffrey Zatkin aka &#8220;Geoffrey Z&#8221; aka &#8220;GZ&#8221; </b><br>Game Designer<br>3 years at Verant<br>B.S. in Psychology (not computer science)<br>Works with the other game designers at Verant Interactive (so can ask questions around)<br>Specialty of the EQ Magic System<br></UL>Topics in this edition range from the Jammin Geoffrey Doll, to the portals in the Timorous Deep.  Even if your not a caster or hybrid you'll find it an enjoyable and interesting read.  Here's an excerpt:<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Naming pets is a cool idea, and one that we have talked about. There are, however, several problems. We already maintain a live staff that checks names as the go in. Adding something that let our staff check pet names as they come in to the world would be using too many real world resources for such a small payoff (adding more staff simply to let players name their pets just won&#8217;t happen). If a player could only pick one name, and their pet got named that every time would be more feasible - but that would mean that your fire elemental and your air elemental would both be named &#8220;flamtar&#8221; or some such. We would probably have to make pet names unique at that point - since we don&#8217;t want two pets having the same name for player recognition reasons. </I></BLOCKQUOTE>Once again I would like to thank Geoffrey for taking the time to do this column.  Thanks GZ! <br><br>Enjoy!

Gordon made a few afternoon posts on the Gameplay Board today.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043559.html"><b>Mobs in Dungeons, should they respawn?</b></a><br>There are certain areas where we've linked spawns in this fashion, however it's not on as wide a scale as advocated here. <br><br>Dungeons are designed to support multiple groups at one time, and this type of design would cause a few problems with that goal.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043325.html"><b>Monk Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The reward that "compensates" for the 14 pound weight limit, poor night vision, lack of equipment, ugly magic resistances, lack of damage until level 30+, player killing due to Feign Death nerf, 60-100+ hour quests, and dignity of being poor for most of a monk's life,,, namely, that we are not dependent on equipment, is almost out of the window now that they made our weapons way better than our hands.]</i> <br><br>Hey now, let's not forget the nifty monk-only weapons that have been turning up lately, and the fact that monks remain the best toe-to-toe melee damage dealer out there.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043193.html"><b>The Hero Complex</b></a><br>You've made some very good points here. Sometimes maximum efficiency isn't linked to doing the most amount of damage possible in the smallest amount of time. Sometimes things can take a little more finesse, and work out better in the long run. <br><br>Thanks for your post. I'll be happy to bump it back up to the first page :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043190.html"><b>Timorous Deep Drop Problems</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Unless I'm mistaken, mobs in Tim Deep drop no loot what so ever. No cash, no nothing...]</i> <br><br>Doh! <br><br>Actually I just checked with the Live team and they are almost done itemizing this zone. Assuming that there are no new items that require an item patch, it won't even require a server outage to bring the new data online.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043154.html"><b>Mez/Enthrall Line</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Recently, I have tried Enthrall on Aviaks, Splitpaw Gnolls and even a few treants. It seems all that gets wiped off the aggro list is me. After the enthrall wears off, the MoBs go right back to attacking my party members. This also happened when I was trying to save a low level SK from a Lioness in E Commons.]</i><br> <br>The Mez series has always had a chance to remove all or some from the hate list. At lower levels, I believe that it's a 100% chance. As the level of the creature goes up, the chance of an integral memory blur goes down. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043057.html"><b>Bugs Discussed</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The high level slowing spells (Togors, Turgurs, chanter spells) are still being overwritten by the weaker slow spells. It seems that spell stacking for the slow spells are reversed, that the weakest spells override the stronger spells.]</i> <br><br>This problem is known and on the list. It occurs because the "attack speed slowing" spells are the only ones where a lower number in the database is "better". We're going to give the programmers a little more time to address this. We also have an idea for a work-around that would make it work correctly. We'll keep you informed. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: The Howling Harpoon has a proc of Memory Blur, however when this weapon procs Mem Blur it procs on the wielder of the weapon...]</i> <br><br>That's not right then. I'll mention it to the live team. A fix should go live in the next item patch. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Just hand the Harpoon to the NPC before you attack, then loot it off him when you are done.]</i> <br><br>ROFL. I'd have to recommend against that :)<br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Actually these things need fixed as well as others.  The hate list bug where the mobs tend to remember the healers upon their repop.]</i> <br><br>Actually they aren't *remembering* anyone, they are "catching" the hate list from another NPC somewhere, and the healer just happens to be at the top. The team is looking into this. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: There is also a pet bug that I've noticed where (I play on a PvP teams server) my pet will end up attacking people in my group (even those on my team which I should NEVER be able to hit).]</i> <br><br>I've seen pets attack people in PvP situations who they should normally be able to attack after someone uses an AoE spell or something, but not as you describe. Any more info you can provide would be helpful. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: How about fixing some of the quests like Canabalize II?]</i> <br><br>"Fix" wouldn't be the correct term. "Put in in the first place" would be. The quest is done and is just waiting for a zone-data patch (doesn't require a full server outage) to go in. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Also, for us Barbarians, when is Verant going to remove the banker in Hallas from being part of the Rogue faction? Though I believe that a lot of bankers are crooks in real life, can you imagine that the good people of Hallas would settle for that? I do not.]</i> <br><br>I've spoken with the faction guy about this. We're considering it, but in the mean time we'd recommend that players doing quests in Halas work to keep their factions balanced by performing quests for both guilds.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041069.html"><b>Procs Erase Typing in Battle?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I realy hope this is a bug and not intentional, if it is intentional, what possible purpose does it serve? It is very frustrating to have crutial phrases like "heal me", "mez zealot!", "assist Nuggin!" and "we are screwed, zone!" constantly dissapearing mid-way through typing due to weapon proc.]</i> <br><br>It probably wouldn't be right to call it a bug, but rather an unintentional design consequence. I'll ask around to see if this is something that could be easily changed or whether it is something that's too far in to change at this point. It's something that I've found annoying as well, along with text editing on the text bar.</UL>

Gordon announced a few changes coming to the experience awarded in Kunark dungeons on the Gameplay Board.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043569.html">the post</a>:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>Based upon some of the posts here, we've reviewed the experience-point (XP) rewards in the Kunark dungeons and some of the outdoor areas and found them to be deficient. Dungeons on Kunark were in general supposed to be giving more experience than equivalent level dungeons on the other three continents, where in-fact they were giving slightly less. <br><br>Over the next couple of days, we'll be updating the experience rewards for many of the Kunark zones, making them more profitable in terms of experience, in light of the increased difficulty and danger associated with them.<br><br>We wish to extend thanks to the players who brought this issue to our attention.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>Thanks Impedance!
