Fresh off the Developer's Corner is a heap of new bits and pieces of information written by Alan in response to feedback sent in by players like you:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>Deity Team Server Feedback</b></a><br>B_O_B wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: ----------------<br>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a faction loss with the locals. Freeport, Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves (high elves, wood elves and half elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is not a dwarven home town.<br>---------------------- <br><br>I asked this question today, <br><br>"'One part of the rules confused me. When it said you would only lose faction by killing a PC if you killed it in their home town, does that mean, for instance, killing a gnome in Steamfont Mountains? Or Ak`Anon?'" <br><br>and got this answer <br><br>"Raenna tells you, 'Hello Guide Raenna here, we're not sure on that question. I recommend that you post the question to Absor on the Developers Corner'" <br><br>So I did what I was told ;-)]</i></font><br><br>Just Ak'Anon. The rule applies to starting cities (not newbie zones). The exceptions are zones like Freeport that have city zones with bat yards attached (and you would lose faction there) and Greater Faydark, where the whole zone is considered a starting city for elves. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Is there any way that you guys can Start a secound Server for this? I am getting Kinda Tired with 300+ people in faydark. and 180 in BB. Or you going to wait for it to be live for a while? or what? Maybe on the new server Coin+item. or not I don't care.. but a new server i think is needed! <br><br>Thanks Andrew]</i></font> <br><br>All new servers look like that. Give it a while and everything should smooth out.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000228.html"><b>Feedback on the Patch</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: ----<br>Players who are invulnerable won't be the primary on the hate-list for NPC's any longer. <br>---- <br><br>Does this mean warriors will fall off of the hate list when they use DISCIPLINE OF FURIOUS against melee only mobs? <br><br>Discipline Description:<br>When using this discipline the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed on them by the opponent they are facing. This discipline lasts for 9 seconds and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<br><br><br>Dractwo Smackdaddy<br>55 Warrior RN ]</i></font><br><br>No. The discipline does not make you invulnerable. It makes you very good at riposting. <br><br>Invulnerability is a very specific thing in EverQuest. You can, as far as I know, only obtain it with a few spells, and all of those spells also make it so that you can't attack back. Divine Aura is the prime example. <br><br>Having a lot more hit points (Rune), being very good at avoiding getting hit (Furious) and things like that are not invulnerability. <br><br>Again, I urge you all to try it out, see how it works in game. <br><br>Sadim wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This is a question about the changes involving when a person goes invis. They way I understand it is if a person goes invis they will dissapear from your target, but if you have see invis or smiliar spell up they will not disapear. My question actualy has to do with the duration of see invis. I play a 50+ druid on tallon zek and my usual 4 buffs that I always have up are SLN, thorncoat, form of the great wolf, unless indoors, and see invis. The duration of the spells are:<br>SLN approx. 72 mins<br>Thorncoat approx. >120 mins<br>Form of the great wolf approx. 144 mins<br>See invis approx. 27 mins<br>Now you can guess which buff I am constantly refreashing and with the changes involving invis this spell is so much more important. My quesiotn is; Is there a way to increase the duration of See invis or maybe add another spell, like improved see invis, that would have a loger duration? <br><br>Thanks ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I see that as a good thing. See Invisible is now a very valuable spell in PvP (for a standard server, it's not really going to matter). The fact that it has a relatively short duration (though you are comparing the duration of a 12-16th level spell with spells of 50+ level) is a good thing. This means that you have to be attentive to your buffs, and that this spell doesn't completely negate the usefulness of invisibility. <br><br>Ashavir wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will look more unique.<br>Skyshrine, Thurgadin and Tizmak all had similar looks for the druid armor. We wanted the Skyshrine stuff to be more distinctive."<br><br>Actually, the Thurgadin and Tizmak (and ulthork) armors aren't "similar", they are identical. The Skyshrine armor was similar in that it was a dark brown tinted tizmak. The new change to Skyshrine stuff is great, we love it =) But is there any way to get the Thurgadin armor changed a bit, even to what the old Skyshrine color was? I know druids are used to running around looking like they are in leather, its been our lot in life for over 2 years, but as it is now, a lvl 60 druid in full Thurg armor looks exactly like they are wearing cheap tizmak off lvl 30 mobs. Gear of this level should at least look like more than plain (velious) leather! ]</i></font><br><br>Nope, we're not going to change them. <br><br>I've been getting a LOT of requests for changes to this tinting or that armor appearance. <br><br>Please stop. <br><br>We're not going to revamp every piece of armor in the game to meet the desires of a few people just so we can upset other people that liked the way they looked already. In a few rare cases we've seen some changes that seem to make sense. But we are not going to go back and add this graphic to that sword or that color to your favorite piece of armor&#8230; <br><br>We certainly understand the desire to have armor that looks the way you want it to look. If you want a different look, there are plenty of other armors or items to use that look different. And no matter what we change to please one person or group, someone else isn't going to like the change. It's not worth our time to annoy one group to please another.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000230.html"><b>SZ Point System</b></a><br>Kronx-Zeb wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The real problem here is that points are only awarded for killing players, which I interpret to mean "Who cares about role-playing anymore? Here's Quake with swords." <br><br>Of course, it's only on one server so what's the big deal? Well, if it works well, it may spread to other PvP servers, then who knows? <br><br>Points just seem an exact contradiction to the nature of EQ. No, we don't know how much mana we have, but we know who's killing the most team members and racking up the points. <br><br>I just hope this is presented in the appropriate manner if it crosses to other servers. Indeed, I wouldn't mind getting bonuses for killing a bzillion orcs. I'll probably have to do that anyway, since the questing system is so screwy. ]</i></font><br><br>The points will only be visible outside the game on our site, there won't be any in-game ranking boards (as far as I know), so that should reduce the Quake feeling. <br><br>The idea is to encourage PvP. Me, I won't be looking at the point totals (except as required by my job to make sure they actually work :)), so they probably won't affect my gameplay in any case. <br><br>I certainly understand your point. No, I don't think you'll ever see anything like this on a standard server. The Orcs will be keeping their tallies on little notepads or in their heads, but not on a leader board&#8230; <br><br>Vidar- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Will the insignia's of like type be stackable? If not I just could see inventorys of nothing but insignias. <br><br>Also in the most recent posts it seems to be that you've given up on the idea of insignias being for a team reward. Is this point system to replace that and the insignias will be for personal reward now? I know nothing is final yet, just wondering if the direction it seems things are going are how you think they are going. ]</i></font><br><br>Right now, yes. We're still looking into ways to aware the team, but individual point scores are easy enough to do, and don't prevent us from creating team awards. But by far the easiest thing to do is award individuals, and that's the current setup. We've not given up on the idea of team awards yet, though. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This has probably been covered and I just missed it.<br>Q: Are the insignia stackable?<br>Q: Will we be able to turn in multiple insignia for greater reward?<br>Q: What about some unique (to this server) tradeskill items made from the insignia (similar to making a necklace from the ears of your foe)? <br><br>Nill<br>Tribunal ]</i></font><br><br>A: Yes, sorta&#8230; there are several types of insignia (4 for each god) and those will stack (you can stack minor Innoruuk insignia together, but not minor and normal; nor can you stack minor Karana with minor Brell).<br>A: Yes, sorta&#8230; Insignia will be combinable. 10 of one will give you the next one up. In fact, you can only get a Superior insignia by combining 10 Greater insignia. It will be an interesting conflict. Do I keep the 10 minor, which are worth more points, or combine them into one normal insignia that takes up less inventory space but worth less points&#8230;<br>A: Probably won't be a tradeskill. Probably will be a quest.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000225.html"><b>Not to get off topic...</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: -Sumoner- wrote: <br><br>Actually, on the test server they have just recently changed the hail command to say "Hail, %t" in spite of what you said here. <br><br>Good for us!<br> <br>Alan <br>--------------<br>What does that have to do with Monster Illusions? :)<br><br>-Miriamele ]</i></font><br><br>I have no idea&#8230; <br><br>:)</UL>

The Developer's Corner was <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000231.html">updated by Alan</a> with some info concerning the emergency patch implemented today:<UL>We fixed the bug with feign death spells that was causing it to fail and sending a "Your spell has been interrupted" message.<P>We fixed the way that NPCs were treating pets.  They were accrediting more hate to pets than they should have.<P>We also fixed a bug with factions that was making it impossible to raise some factions.  There may still be factions that you can't raise because there are no methods for raising them, not because of a bug.  If you get a faction message you will also get a faction gain (or hit).<P>We also added a message that will let you know when you can no longer gain or lose faction with a certain group.  It will say:<P>Your faction standing with &lt;faction name&gt; could not possibly get any worse.<P>or<P>Your faction standing with &lt;faction name&gt; could not possibly get any better.<P>That was the essence of the patch last night.

The first edition of <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/games/interviews/askbrad/">Ask Brad McQuaid</a> is up at Voodoo Extreme.  Topics ranged from EverQuest, SWG, other MMORPGs and more.  Here's a blurb:<UL><b>Question: In MMORPG's such as Everquest (or in any of your other creations for that matter), I'm rather curious as to how much of the character's 'minds' arescripted or true AI.  If it is AI, do you have a dedicated 'AI guy' or do acouple other people take on the job in addition to their other work?</b><br><br>Brad's Reply : Well, it's a little bit of both.  NPCs are set up with command lists, which are really scripts, that tell them what to do under normal circumstances. In other words, a guard might be told to patrol a certain area.  But then if something unexpected happens (let's say, the NPC is attacked), then a fairly sophisticated AI system kicks in and reacts accordingly (depending on the situation, the attributes of the NPC, etc.)  And yes, we do have one guy who specializes in maintaining the AI code, however the scripts are handled by the game designers.</UL>Check out the complete first edition by following <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/games/interviews/askbrad/">this link</a>!

The new deity team server was again the big subject tackled on the Developer's Corner.  Here's today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>More Sullon Zek Feedback</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Kendrik posted on the safehouse saying that rogues can also pick pocket on Sullon. <br><br>One question. <br><br>Why are rogues allowed to pick pocket on Sullon while they're not able to on Vallon or Tallon? <br><br>Thank you for any light you can shed on this subject. <br><br>Hamm Sammich<br>Rogue of Vallon ]</i></font><br>Simply because we haven't tried it out. <br><br>There is the possibility that any, all, or none of the rules from Sullon might be moved to other servers. But we want to see how things work over a time on a full-fledged Live server before we make any decisions. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: _______________________<br>Not a problem. The system is set up so that spells won't work on anyone twenty levels below the level of the spell. So it won't be a problem for any spell under 20th level, such as Bind Affinity.<br>_______________________ <br>I want to make sure I understand this correctly. Is this true only for beneficial spells, or for ANY spell? Can a level 50 Wizard pound my level 7 Pally with Shock of Lightning, a 12th level Wizzie spell? Or is this covered under the level range for attacking? And if it is covered byt the 5 level range, is that also figured by spell level rather than caster level. I think we could all agree that the level 50 Wiz could easily devastate any 10th level group using spells under 20th level, by virtue of his Mana alone, never mind if he has some big Enchanter / Cleric buddies :)<br><br>The more I see of Sullon Zek, the more anxious I get to start a toon on the live server. Tell the team they are doing a fine job. <br>Grehaak<br>31 Ranger<br>E'ci Server ]</i></font><br><br>Well, yes and no. <br><br>The 50th level wizard can go ahead and cast his 50th level spells on your 7th level paladin. He'll be able to kill you with one spell, I suspect. <br><br>The restriction is only on most beneficial spells, not on damage spells. <br><br>Like we've been saying, Sullon is going to be a harsh server.

This afternoon Alan <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000230.html">announced initial plans</a> for the Sullon Zek point system.  Here's the scoop:<UL>Many of you know that we've been planning to add a point system to the deity team PvP server. The idea is to track the characters that are doing the most for their team, and to allow everyone to see what the activity is like on the server.<br><br>We're working on that system now. The 'points' are already being counted, have been since the server went Live. Here's what we have in mind (and we'd appreciate any feedback on this).<br><br>Points are only gained if the target/victim is 20th level or above.<br>Points are only gained for killing characters within 5 levels of you.<br>For each kill you earn 100 points.<br>But for killing the same person a second time within a 60 minute period, you only gain 50 points.<br>For the third kill on the same person in a 60 minute period you gain 25 points.<br>For the fourth, you gain no points.<br>For any over four against the same character in a 60 minute period you lose 25 points.<br>Being killed by someone within 5 levels of you causes you to lose 25 points.<br>Insignia are worth points as long as they are in your inventory or bank (anywhere in your character's possession.) when points are tallied.<br>Lesser Insignia = 1 point<br>Normal Insignia = 5 points<br>Greater Insignia = 10 points<br>Superior Insignia = 25 points<br><br>Right now we are planning on daily or weekly updates (depending on the statistic being updated) of stats like the top 20 over all and for each team, perhaps the top 20 guilds over all and for each team.<br><br>Keep in mind: This is all subject to change!<br><br>If at some future date we feel that the point system is not working out, or if we decide to change the values of points gained or other such things, we will. Obviously we don't plan to make any changes once it is all established but keep in mind that this is an extraneous feature, a for fun thing, and it's not inviolate.<br><br>So send in your comments and suggestions.<br><br>Alan</UL>

A very well written <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/previews/0,10869,2780291,00.html">preview of the Shadows of Luclin</a> has found its way onto the pages of GameSpot.  This article also has a few screenshots and design sketches to go with.  The following excerpt discusses factions:<UL>The evil and good Combine, the Shissar, and the Vah Shir form the four basic factions on Luclin. Faction will work in very much the same way as in the rest of Norrath. Those who choose to play Vah Shir will be able to create their characters in a new starting city and will of course belong to the Vah Shir faction. It remains to be seen how existing characters will be aligned according to the four base factions; however, if your characters have previously killed a number of Kerrans, you can still gain positive Vah Shir faction on Luclin by fighting those with the opposing faction.</UL>

You can't attack anything with Divine Aura up&#8230; so no, they couldn't. But, yes, they could conceivably avoid being attacked if they all used Divine Aura at the same time. Someone else nearby, though, is going to take a beating&#8230; <br><br>We have no plans to change the casting time on any items at this point. When those casting times were put on those items, there was no intent for the user to be able to sit down while using them. The fact that this was possible wasn't part of the determination for the times given to them&#8230; basically, they now work as intended. <br><br>Obviously we've received a lot of e-mail from people that play magicians.

You will no longer be able to sit while using items or casting spells.  This will not affect bard songs, which will still work as they always have, but will affect all items, even those with song-like effects.<br><br><br>** Spell Changes **<br><br>- Skin Like Nature and Natureskin should stack with more spells now (though not with each other).<br><br>- Aegolism can now be clicked off.<br><br>- Imbue Ivory has had its casting level lowered to 29.<br><br>- Shard of the Core will be tradable now.<br><br>- Shroud of Hate and Visions of Grandeur should stack properly now.<br><br>- Several new Translocation spells have been added.<br><br>- Call of the Hero will no longer remove the target from NPCs' hatelists if the target is not summoned far enough.<br><br>- Egress will now work indoors.<br><br>- Wind of the North, Wind of the South, Markar's Relocation and Tishan's Relocation have had their additional restrictions removed, and can now be cast from any zone where other similar spells can be cast.<br><br>- Summon Companion can now be used by Necromancers, Shamans, Enchanters, Shadowknights in addition to Magicians.<br><br>- Deadeye should now stack with Dead Man Floating, but should not stack with Acumen.<br><br>- Plainsight will now stack with Dead Man Floating, but not with Acumen.<br><br>- The Great Divide portal spells are now 39th level instead of 44th level.<br><br>- Spirit of the Oak will no longer be overwritten by any beneficial spells.<br><br>- Paralyzing Poison spells should no longer be broken by direct damage spells.<br><br>- Hsagra's Wrath and Porlos' Fury now have a 5 second recast delay.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- The effect on the 10th ring should have fewer stacking conflicts with haste buffs. <br><br>- The effect of the Monk epic, Celestial Tranquility, will stack with the higher end haste spells. Keep in mind - the highest haste will always win out.  This means that the spells will stack, the haste components will not.<br><br>- Speed of the Shissar has had its duration increased from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.  This effect should no longer conflict with Call of Earth.<br><br>- Bone Ring of Condemnation will no longer be usable in the secondary slot, it will only be wearable on the finger.<br><br>- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will look more unique.<br><br>- Circlet of Shadow will no longer drop in-game.  The Circlet of Shadows, can now be found in its place.  This item differs from the original only in that it has a five-second casting time.  Existing Circlets of Shadow will retain the same functionality as before, though we may change existing Circlets at some future date.<br><br><br>** Quest Changes **<br><br>- King Tormax is now a little more particular about who he gives quests to.<br><br>- The Iksar Shaman 6th Skull/cudgel quest should be working now. <br><br>- Rumor has it that there is a new source for green dragon scales in Norrath.<br><br><br>** PvP Changes **<br><br>- If you go link dead on a PvP server and are killed you can still be looted.<br><br>- When a player becomes invisible (or hides successfully) every other player that had them targeted will lose their target.  This is true for all servers, but has the greatest implications on PvP servers.  The use of spells that allow you to see through invisibility will prevent you from losing your target if that target hides or goes invisible.<br><br>- Faction hits on Rallos Zek:  Killing a person in one of his or her home cities will cause a faction hit with residents of that city.<br><br><br>** Miscellaneous **<br><br>- We've addressed a lot of spelling and grammatical errors over the past few weeks.  For example we have corrected all misspellings of "deity" in messages to the player, changed Cantana to Cantata and others.<br><br>- The 'Fab Four' in Dagnor's Cauldron will no longer assist Undertow Skeletons.<br> <br>- Instill Doubt/Intimidation can no longer be used while sitting, and sitting after starting it will cancel it.<br> <br>- Mastery of language skills now occurs at 100, not at 101.  This was a problem for masters of a language, since language skills could not go over 100.<br><br>- The messages for eating and drinking now say "Chomp... Chomp," or "Glug... Glug..." so that they can't be copied with emotes.<br><br>- Helms on Barbarians, Trolls, and Ogres should no longer block the first person view when in combat. <br><br>- Sirens Grotto has been changed a bit.  It should be a more interesting zone now.<br><br><br>** NOTE **<br><br>Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers.  Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their home town.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Dragons sent in a detailed report of the slaying of RiverSource on Tarew Marr.  It was a huge battle so read up:<BLOCKQUOTE>In the zone of the Warrens, Verant has added a mysterious new mob.  It<br>is known merely as the "River Source".  As the name implies, its an<br>invisible mob at the source of the river in the warrens.   What made<br>this interesting was when a GM stated it had never been killed before.<br><br>Upon hearing that, <a href="http://www.llts.org">The Syndicate</a><br>decided the mob had to be killed.  Being as it was in the Warrens one<br>might assume it is a quick and easy midlevel kill.  That is not the<br>case.  Although the mob is a midlevel one and doesnt hit hard, it is<br>definitely not a quick kill.  This mob appears to have more HP than any<br>other mob in game.  It had anywhere from 1,000,000 HP to upwards of<br>5,000,000 HP.  A constant beating for hours on end is what it took for<br>this mob to die.  Thousands of HP damage per minute and yet it still<br>took hours to die.  Movement of the health bar was imperceptible except<br>over time.  Exact HP numbers were difficult to judge over that length of<br>time of constant attacking.  <br><br>Oddly, when it died it left no corpse and a new one spanwed nearly<br>instantly.  It is unlike Verant to add a mob that serves no purpose. <br>There must be some purpose for this strange mob with a million or more<br>HP.  What that purpose is we dont yet know.

A single update was made to the Developer Corner by Alan today.  The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html">update in question</a> centers around Sullon Zek:<UL>Erithe wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have on difficulty. I would like to play High Elven Wizard who follows Rallos Zek; however, Rallos Zek is considered a bad guy in my home town of Felwithe and my factions are directly opposed to Tunare in the new PVP. Is there anyway a starting city would ever be changed to reflect the deities chosen? I mean, it might be safer to start elsewhere if a High Elf were to chose Rallos Zek, and, as one of the main deities for wizards, it seems too bad to restrict High Elves to chosing Tunare for the sake of safety ... Anyway, just some thoughts on that :)]</i></font><br><br>Actually it's that dynamic, that risk, that I like about this server. Yes, if you want to be safer, then you choose a safer race/deity combination. If you want the challenge, then you choose the riskier one. And, well, it isn't all that hard to relocate your character if you want a safer place to live. Just do it before you reach sixth level. <br><br>Beazlebub wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Can someone clarify please? <br><br>Player 1 is 40th level, player 2 is 10th level. Will player 2 con white to player 1 because a level 40 can attack a level 10, or will player 2 con green because he is > -5 levels? <br><br>Also, <br><br>Since the play nice policies are basically out the window, what happens if I had received a warning for long casting a while back? Will the warnings still apply? <br><br>I'm sure this is a whole different can of worms, but what if I were banned over something that is a legal tactic now? and soon to be elsewhere too. Any comment? ]</i></font><br><br>He'll /consider green. You get green if they are below the 5 level range, white/black if they are within the 5 level range, and red if they are over it. <br><br>As for your second question, no. If someone chose not to follow the rules whatever they were, whenever they were, then that person earned the warning and gets to keep it. If someone was banned for breaking the rules, they stay banned. <br><br>Kilithyr_TZ wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Greetings, I am voicing my support of Zeksiss Tallonclaw's idea regarding turning in a "set" of medallions looted from other players on SZ for a experience reward. <br><br>I really feel that a small, even if its very small, xp reward for killing in pvp will be a very helpful addition to the server ruleset. <br><br>Please consider his idea. ]</i></font><br><br>There is virtually no chance that there will ever be an experience award for PvP. That's pretty much non-negotiable. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "Why can we /con each other and find out which team we belong to?<br><br>Why not have no /con and let us figure it out ourselves...if we are a neutral dark elf we will be darn careful with other dark elves...might be a fun way of doing things.<br><br>I argued the exact same point. But there's something we both missed. You can tell if you can attack someone by simply hitting the autoattack button. Without a rather tremendous overhaul of the game system, this will always be the easiest way to tell if someone is on the opposite team. So adding it to the /consider function is a actually a good thing. "<br><br>Besides, it seems to me if you went around lacerating everyone to see how they react, they'd *all* glare at you threateningly... :P <br><br>Balerion]</i></font><br><br><br>Actually, if that were true, I'd be all in favor of forcing people to actually attack someone to learn which team they are on. This would actually mean that people would have to know their enemy a little bit, something that I'm in favor of. <br><br>Unfortunately, autoattack will turn on, no matter how far away you are. So you just stand out of combat range and hit 'a' to discover if someone is an enemy or not. <br><br>Now if the target got a notification of this, or if autoattack wouldn't come on unless you were in combat range&#8230; That would be interesting. <br><br>Azketh wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well I didn't a response the first time so I will do it again, why are there no good dwarves? <br><br>The guild I am in on Karana plans on starting on this new server and we are a paladin cleric only role playing (good) guild. We have many dwarves in our guild, and people would like to continue to play dwarves. <br><br>So I ask again why are there no good dwarves? <br><br>Also why did you add evil to wood elves? I may be wrong but I don't recall Rallos Zek being an option before.<br>With this in mind, could you change the code for killing people in their home town were Greater Faydark is conserned. It looks to me that even in this zone neutral and evil out number good and this mean there is a big disadvantage for high elves. A good high elf has no were to hunt early on in life past 5. steamfont will have mostly evil and neutral (more evil) gnomes, butcher block mountains will have all neutral dwarves. all this leaves is lesser faydark and dragnors cauldron, but those to will be controlled by these others.<br>I honestly don't see many people playing high elves in these conditions. ]</i></font><br><br>The only changes to deity/race combinations we made for this server were the Barbarians of Marr and the Monks of Veeshan. SO, yes, wood elves can worship Rallos on every server. <br><br>There are no good dwarves because Brell is neutral, and so is Bristlebane (I think those are the only gods they can worship). I'm sorry if this is a problem for your guild, but it's actually one of the best things that the neutral team has going for it. <br><br>As for Greater Faydark&#8230; Nobody knows who will control what. You will certainly be safe in all of Greater Faydark as an elf, at least from other elves. <br><br>As I've said, this server will be harsh. Life for some will be continual persecution. But I suspect that it will be the evil and neutral elves that will be at risk in Faydark, not the good ones. Only time will tell. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 'Yup, one day it will just be there.' <br><br>You're kidding me right? I was told that you were going to call each of us on the phone and notify us that the server would be up in an hour. <br><br>Qalnor <br><br>PS Is what Kendrick posted on the Safehouse definate? ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I do have free long distance on my cell phone&#8230; but, darn it, the batteries have run out! <br><br>I dunno, what did he post? <br><br>If it was something about rogues and hiding and invisibility, yes, that's true. If it was something about a party, a lot of booze and&#8230; other things, that's a lie! A lie I tell you! <br><br>:)<br><br>Alan</UL>

They will get more detailed as you approach them and loose detail as you get further away. Very much like how our eyes see the world.

Shadoe has compiled the <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid993264820,50713,">Reader Response for the Questing for EQ Comedy</a> editorial.  It's a great follow-up to the original article with some great commentary from people around the community.  Check out this excerpt:<BLOCKQUOTE><b>If you're telling me the strip isn't funny... fine. I don't mind that. I've never claimed to be funny. As a matter of fact on numerous occasions I've stated specifically that I am an illustrator and not funny in the least. If that's a reason not to read the strip, that's fine too. I'm not offended by people choosing to ignore my opinionated, if colorful, ravings. </b><br><br>I never said I was going to stop reading your material, Woody.  Nor that of Scott Kurtz or anyone else who feels the need to shroud their soapbox-standing in the guise of comedy.  If you review the article, you'll notice that I never encouraged my readers to do so, either.  I don't do boycotts; I make simple observations.  It's up to the readers to decide if they concur. <br><br>You may never have made the claim to be funny in so many words, but for you to make the above statement is like someone claiming they're not a politician while at the same time running for U.S. Congress.  I certainly don't buy it, and I fancy nobody else will either.  Your claim to humor lies in your work, which is copiously funny, by and large.  That, sir, speaks far louder than words and sets a distinct precedent to your fans, whether or not you choose to acknowledge it. </BLOCKQUOTE>As always, thanks Shadoe!

Fear/Charm again. :)<br><br>Restrict it to only work within the xp-loss range? ]</i></font><br><br>No. Fear and charm just cause too many problems when cast on player characters. Not the least of which is that when charmed or feared you are an NPC, and NPC take more damage from player cast spells than players do. <br><br>We really don't plan to reactivate those spells for PvP in even the most remote future. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: And then on friday, Absor announced when the server would be coming up, and the world rejoiced. <br><br>Qalnor ]</i></font><br><br>Hmmm&#8230; interesting idea.

If he is successful can you still kill him? ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, you can still kill him. We've been thinking of ways to make this a little more beneficial in PvP, but right now it's not going to change. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: will there be some kind of heads up when the server is going live or will we have to try and log in to the normal EQ servers and It's just going to be there, I gotta know couse being kind of important at work it's tough for me to just not show up without major faction loss with the boss<br>Cygany (the Fist of Veeshan)<br>Sullen Zek(test) ]</i></font><br><br>Let me think about it some more. <br>But faction with your boss should only be secondary to faction with your wife. Your ability to play on the new server should be a distant third&#8230; <br><br>Fiall wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Why can we /con each other and find out which team we belong to? <br><br>Why not have no /con and let us figure it out ourselves...if we are a neutral dark elf we will be darn careful with other dark elves...might be a fun way of doing things. ]</i></font><br><br>I argued the exact same point. But there's something we both missed. You can tell if you can attack someone by simply hitting the autoattack button. Without a rather tremendous overhaul of the game system, this will always be the easiest way to tell if someone is on the opposite team. So adding it to the /consider function is a actually a good thing. <br><br>SlackMF wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>This may be a silly question!

Slate this triggers a spawning of a Dark Elf Dragoon that is permanent until defeated by an opposing force which spawns a replacement of the Dragoon with a similarly aligned MOB. The same goes for Vendors. It would seem to me that this would give the teams the ability to control Territiry and put some teeth into any kind of invasion. ]</i></font><br><br>Also an interesting idea. We're not really planning on making any such major changes to NPCs for the new server at this point. But I'll pass it on to the team. <br><br>Bot_a_Bing wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Please please please tell us all that you will give us at least a day or two advanced notice about the launching of Sullon Zek. <br><br>Some of us would like to make plans for the opening day, and reserve our names, etc. <br><br>Keep up the good fight!]</i></font> <br><br>Hmm&#8230; I dunno&#8230; <br><br>As for names, well, if your name is uncommon, then you really won't have a problem getting it on the server. <br><br>Ok, we're <b>not</b> going announce the exact time and date for the arrival of Sullon Zek. <br><br>The reasons are pretty simple, really. We are expecting a huge influx of people on this server. We'd like it to stay up for a while. Hopefully not announcing that it's up will help to stagger the volume of players logging in at any given time. <br><br>Sure, there is a slight advantage to those that discover the server is up and log in first. But that's ok with me. After all, someone that buys EverQuest three weeks after the server is up will be in the same position. <br><br>So good luck and good hunting on Sullon.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000216.html"><b>Anti-Summoning</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Any comments on the fact that the majority of players would rather see an anti-summoning spell a lot more than they want to see an anti-gating spell? <br><br>(one side thought on an anti-summoning spell: It should be a buff cast on players as opposed to a de-buff cast on mobs.. this would give casting mobs the chance to cancel it) <br><br>-Run ]</i></font><br><br>Sure. <br><br>First, well, it is nearly impossible to tell what 'the majority of players would rather see'. We guess, we all guess, about what exactly it is that most players want, but nobody actually knows. <br><br>As for that sort of spell&#8230; no, I don't think such a spell will be created. For the same reason that we don't plan to add a summoning suppression type spell. There are, sadly, cases where summoning is an important way to prevent certain exploits. We don't plan to create spells that prevent summoning.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000223.html"><b>Effects on Bard Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Will this change effect the bard songs? If this fix is to prevent people from sitting to med while they are using an item, or casting a spell, will this change make it so that us bards will no longer be able to sit while singing our songs? It is nice to be able to sing Hymn and sit down to get the extra couple hp's a tick, or when we get low on mana because of the 39 charm song and we need to med, if we can't at least have a song going durring this time to help the party out, then might as well say goodbye to the doubling mana regen we get while sitting, as we won't be allowed to sit anymore. <br><br>As an aside, it will also eliminate a fun taunt bards have with shamans and druids, as we run past them backwards while ducking and singing selo's. <br><br>Please for once think of the bards before you put something like this on the live servers,<br>Harmani Camlhach, Bard of Kelethin (Vallon Zek) ]</i></font><br><br>This won't affect bard songs. In fact, it gives a little bonus to bards. <br><br>Here's how it will work, as I understand it. <br><br>When you are casting a spell or using an item that casts a spell or a song, you will no longer be able to sit down. You will still be able to sit while singing. In fact, you will now be able to start singing while already seated. <br><br>Ducking will immediately interrupt the casting of any spell or the use of any item. It shouldn't affect songs at all. <br><br>Over all this will make things easier for casters of all sorts. <br><br>Werdse_Wisdem <br><br>"The main reason for this change is to fix an 'exploit'. "<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm guessing you're referring to being able to activate an item, then sit until just before it goes off to meditate, then stand for the resolution. <br><br>You said 'exploit' in quotes. IS this an exploit? Is doing it in convention to the EULA? Or is "'exploit'" in this sense "something we don't want to happen, so we're changing it" but not punishable? ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, that's what we're changing. As for punishment and 'exploit' and all that, don't worry about it. It won't be possible to do it after the patch anyhow, so it won't really matter one way or the other.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000225.html"><b>NPCs and Illusions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Ok, wait a minute. You're talking about it giving us to much freedom of movement. How would it be any different than if we had invisibilty cast on us? Except that it effects factions, causing some monsters to be more friendly, and guards to be less friendly. If you're worried about the pet hanging around, just cause the pet to freak out like it does when you cast invis. You can either be a monster or have a pet. I think the ability to turn into a monster would be awesome! It would be so much fun to run around EC as a GIANT! Think of the ruckus we could cause! <br><br>Kishan ]</i></font><br><br>Ruckuses are great. I've got no problem with that. <br><br>But an illusion is different than invisibility. There is no 'see invisibility' for illusions. The places where we've purposefully staged NPCs that you just can't sneak by would be compromised by such spells. NPCs treat different body types differently, and an illusion essentially gives you a body type. <br><br>Yes, we could spend a lot of time working it out so that such a spell could exist, making special exceptions in code for each illusion in each zone. But that's not practical, it just isn't justifiable to apply the resources to create a single spell and then the resources to fix all the bad situations that such a spell would invariably create. <br><br>Nobody denies that it's an interesting idea. It's just not something we're planning to do. <br><br>Xombie wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Although I am sure that you will get several responses such as this, I still feel that it is worth a moment to suggest it. Perhaps the solution to the faction issue would be to make the caster KOS to everything while using a mimic type of illusion spell. Please announce ahead of time that this would be the case and I believe that most enchanters would accept this limitation. I believe that to prevent problems resulting from excessive polygon count, you could check the 'giant' flag of the target (or whatever the 'thou shalt not mes or stun' flag is) as an indicator as to whether it would be allowed. This would prevent people from becoming dragons and other graphic intensive creatures. ]</i></font><br><br>I sure have received several. :)<br><br>It just doesn't work like that. When you look like a thing, you are that thing for all practical purposes. And we can't just make all of your factions KOS. That would mean storing at least two versions of your factions, meaning more server storage, more overhead&#8230; It's just not practical. <br><br>I hate to say that sometimes decisions come down to matters of best bang for the buck. But sometimes they do. <br><br>Faerenka wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'd like to point out that the reason of not giving us moster illusion, that we would have too much freedom to roam monster areas, is somewhat silly. Giving a High Elf the freedom to roam about in the Dark Elf city (and vice versa) might be considered the same thing. As far as the body type thing goes I am sure you know what you are talking about. <br><br>I think it would be cool to have a minor illusion for our pet :)]</i></font><br><br>Freedom in Neriak is one thing. Freedom to explore other places is different. We've obviously intended to allow enchanters the freedom to explore starting cities. And what I'm trying to tell you is that there are most certainly other places where we intentionally do not want enchanters to have that freedom. <br><br>At least you accept the body type thing. :)  I was getting worried that nobody would&#8230; <br><br>Minor Illusion for pets&#8230; hmm&#8230; interesting&#8230; I'll pass that on. <br><br>I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just explaining how it works. Creatures see body types. They react to them. It is one of the factors that determines how an NPC will react to you. Yes, sure, we could probably design some seriously complicated code that would allow a spell to work, but the effort would be pretty serious, and we're not ready at this time to trade that effort for this one spell when it might buy us better things.</UL>

We received the following report form Loreths Leafblade:<BLOCKQUOTE>I am but a Ranger of the 20th season, but what I saw was enough bravery to challenge even Veeshan. What I saw were the forces of Good under the banner of Tunare against an unknown Evil. Here is the ballard of the Battle of the Mill:<br><br>The day was quite, and all was well. Warriors like Sepis and Chanters like Aeonan were clearing the land of the Evil Sarnaks. The day was good. Then, like music to many ears, sounds happened. No one could explain it. Not even the Brave Thori who was an inspiration to all throughout the future fighting. The sound was mystifing. Then, By Tunare herself, the sky turned Blood red, and screams were heard throughout the Lake area. Methus the Druid, Mkae, Xorbraazz the Monk, Drevinn the Bard, Sindili, and Spiderr all reported of strange Goblins appearing, headed towards the Mill. That's when Mahon, Thori, Kristie and others started to make their stand. By the Reassuring words of Tunare, Elders and Young folk all threw themeselves into the goal of protecting the mill. Even though they were up against uknown forces from unknown origins, they showed bravery umatched. Everyone threw themselves against the new Goblins, Fighters, Warriors and Spell Casters. And by the power of Tunare, They were repulsed. The light triumphed over the Darkness. The sky slowly turned to black, then back to blue and all was quiet. An eerie silence feel over the assembled. Then, the moaning of the wounded, followed by the cheers of the victors. Then, vallant folk such as Torent prayed to their Gods and offered Ressurections to the needy. Tunare triumphed once again, And all was safe, until the next time, when the forces of evil will meet the Defenders of the Mill.<br><br>That is the story as I told it. It was a honor to fight by these gallant ladies and gentlemen, and I hope this ballad is a just response to their bravery.<br><br>Loreths Leafblade<br><br>20th Ranger<br><br>Guardians of Fate<br><br>Mithaniel Marr</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
