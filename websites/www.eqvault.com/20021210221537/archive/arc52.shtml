Therefore, the injunctive relief that we sought is not needed unless there are future attempts to stop this legal commerce.  <br><br>We are monitoring any attempts to deliver private information from any auction site to Verant or Sony.  Should this information be used to suspend accounts or otherwise harm any individuals we would like to know.</UL>Here's also a clip from the email they've sent out:<UL>1) The suit against Verant and Sony has been put on hold.

An article about the recent Fan Faire event in Baltimore appeared on the pages of the Washington Post today on page Page E11.  The <a href="">recap of the event</a> was also made available online as well.  Here's a clip:<UL>It might seem that these folks never leave the house -- but many of these fans traveled a long way to get to the Fan Faire. Fifteen-year-old Dillon Keech flew out from Kalamazoo, Mich., and skipped two days of school to be there. Which is one reason that he was annoyed with Verant: After so much effort, there was no organized way for fans to meet up with one another once they got to Baltimore before Saturday's program began.<br><br>"It's Verant standard," he kvetched. "It's disorganized, it's late, and there's a lame excuse."</UL>Thanks Sabbathlight!

YAAP5 is the fifth event in<br>the Young Adventurers Assistance Program. All races<br>are welcome and we will be stationed away from guards<br>for safety. <br><br>We'll have food, drink, buffs, and weapons available<br>for free for characters under 10 seasons. Armor for<br>all classes available for easy tasks. Magic items and<br>jewelry will also be given as rewards for simple<br>quests, games, races, and the like. Equipment will be<br>suitable for adventurers starting their careers:<br>expect fine steel, banded, raw silk and the like. If<br>you have Crafted Armor or a Charred Guardian Shield at<br>5 seasons, you've already had enough assistance :-). <br><br>There will be little quests and games throughout the<br>region. Swimmers brave enough (and fast enough) to go<br>through the pirahna pool will be well rewarded. And<br>where better to play hide-and-seek than Rivervale and<br>the Thicket?<br><br>We invite everyone to attend and enjoy the fun.  All<br>are welcome to join us and use their powers or extra<br>equipment to assist others. We'll have free alcoholic<br>beverages for all who want to imbibe and just relax<br>with the crowd. We'll make sure to have enough drink<br>so<br>we can find out if halflings really have greater<br>capacity...<br> <br>We hope to see you there!<br> <br>Shalkai Windchaser, Guildleader<br>Aven du Sora<br><a href="http://ads.eqhq.com">http://ads.eqhq.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for letting us know.

The dedicated class "Talk" threads were again the big subject discussed on the boards.  Here's today's installment of the Absor Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-5.html"><b>Ranger Talk, Part 3</b></a><br>Georgia wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: *spank*!!!]</i></font> <br><br>Now THAT'S how I like to see a thread start out! <br><br>Letholas wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Balance Items 7-8 makes me throw my hands up in frustration!]</i></font> <br><br>I can help you a bit here.

There are an average of 7 tentacles that pop in a full spawn. However the number of Amys is on the order of 30 or so I would guess.

This is from one of our designers: <br><br>--- <br><br>We've ran through the Evade mechanics I described yesterday, and made a few refinements. <br><br>If Evading while at the top of the hate list, you will still be moved between the current #2 and #3 person on the hate list. In addition, if the amount of hate reduction calculated is less than 500 actual points, it becomes 500. <br><br>This insures that Evade will always be at least as effective as Jolt, and it will mitigate the Multiple Rogue Syndrome many of you fear. Example: <br><br>Rogue1 has 10000 hate<br>Warrior2 has 9800 hate<br>Ranger3 has 9795 hate. <br><br>Using the formula (#2hate-#3hate)/2(+#3hate)=Rogue Evade hate, the Rogue1 would be set to #2 with 9798 hate. 2 points lower than the new #1 player, and 202 points lower than his initial hate. Sucks, doesn't it? <br><br>Since 202 is less than 500, the actual hate would be adjusted 500 points lower, setting Rogue1 to 9500 hate, which could actually move him lower than #3. Doesn't suck. <br><br>Now if the three players at the top of the list were all rogues, the rotation of the three would not be as likely, since each one of them drops by a minimum of 500 points, IF there are other non-rogue damage dealers around. The non-rogues are much more likely to claim top spot rather than the trio of rogues. Lets throw some more math out here for you: <br><br>Above example, Rogue1 just evaded, setting his hate to 9500. <br><br>Warrior2 is actually Rogue2, with 9800 points of hate, now the top spot. He evades, placing him between 9795 and 9500, which is 9648. 9800-9648 is only 152, so he is bumped down 500 to 9300. <br><br>Ranger3 is actually Rogue3. He is now in the top spot with 9795. He evades, placed between 9500 and 9300, to 9400. Again, less than 500, so he is moved to 9295. <br><br>Now, you say that Rogue1 at 9500 should be back on top of the hate list, right? <br><br>This could be the case, but you have to realize that while these three Evades were going on, there may well have been other damage dealers in the encounter who have exceeded 9500 hate. <br><br>Each time a string of rogues evades, it becomes more and more efficient for the evader, pushing them down to the point where they are eclipsed by the other damage dealers. <br><br>We're testing this out now, and so far it looks pretty good. <br><br>In addition, if Evading while not #1 (pre-Evade), your total hate is reduced by 10% [i]OR[/i] 500, whichever is greater, not to go below 128. <br><br>We've also looked a few more rogue issues, and expect to have them adjusted in the following weeks. None of these are promised, keep this in mind, but we are looking into them. <br><br>Reduction of Min Range for throwing weapons. Not a removal, but a reduction, to around 3-5 feet. Should make them easier to use. <br><br>Instill Doubt still on the same timer as it is currently, but allowing that first backstab or special attack to land after ID goes off. This will happen. Still rewards those of you with good timing. <br><br>Apply Poison putting the Rogue in kneel mode similar to bind wounds, and releasing him when complete. Great player idea, this will probably happen.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864.html"><b>Necromancer Talk</b></a><br>So let's talk about necromancers. <br><br>As with all the other threads, I want to talk about class balance here, not about bugs or epic weapons. You may certainly present bugs and concerns about the epic weapons, but they will not be the main concern of this thread. <br><br>Unlike the other threads, I have a fairly good list of ideas already garnered from several other posts to start us out. It is not complete, I'm sure. But it is certainly a good place to start our discussion. <br><br>Also, we are not looking to make necromancers any more effective at soloing than they already are. And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now. The primary issues that I see revolve around the battle with the boss monsters. But I certainly want to hear from necromancers with concerns about all levels of the game. And, once again, I have to warn you that since we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance. <br><br>Anyhow, here's what I have already. <br><br>Ignite Bones: Despite the coolness factor, this spell can't really be used on the big raids because it suddenly pulls the enemy out of range, and by the time you relocate your range, one warrior could conceivably have done more damage than the spell is going to do. The best solution is to make the skeleton match the monster, if we can find some way to do that. Fixing this one spell might solve a lot of concerns. If we can&#8217;t size the skeleton, then we probably should remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD. Note: Any change to this spell should also be made to Chill Bones (55). <br><br>Lifetaps: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters. If we are telling necromancers that they have a valid place at the final encounter because they can give mana to other casters, then they will need a way to regain mana. Lich and Lifetap are the way they do that now. I am not convinced that this is something that we should change. But this is the single most asked for thing by the necromancer community. Perhaps, if made in conjunction with the fixing the bug in Lich, then perhaps this could be balanced.<br><br>DoTs and corpse poofing: This affects everyone. Hopefully this is now much improved, but I&#8217;m not taking it off the list until I&#8217;m convinced it has been fixed.<br><br>Mana transfer: Again, if their &#8216;place&#8217; against the boss mob is to transfer mana, then perhaps we should allow them to do it at a better rate. A 2:1 transfer rate might be enough. I'm not at all certain that this should be done in conjunction with any change to Lifetaps in those encounters, though, as a change in one makes the other far more effective and might just be too much of a change. But this could certainly be considered if we fix the bug with the Lich spells.<br><br>Infusion: Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, they might actually cast this spell. Otherwise, those Essence Emerald&#8217;s will only be used for raising the dead. <br><br>Defoliation: There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on. I fully understand how we need to limit the use of any spell that is overly efficient against any one monster type. But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be. I've asked the players for a list that they'd like reviewed, but I've received nothing yet. <br><br>Track Corpse: Broken spell. Is it going to stay that way?<br><br>Epic Weapon: The look and effect are not well loved in the community.<br><br>Lich Series: This series of spells is broken. It is more powerful than it should be. It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana. It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'. Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players. This change also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2). This is a bug that we have chosen not to change in the past because it would be a 'nerf'. I think in conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, we should also look at this series and decide if we should put it right. If it remains as it is, the necromancer is going to be limited in the improvements it can gain, as the class is already using a powerful and broken spell series. Note: Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055083-2.html"><b>Necro Raids</b></a><br>Hi all. <br><br>I've just opened the Necromancer Talk thread. With as much reading as I've been doing lately, I can't keep up with all these threads. <br><br>So let's move this to the Necromancer Talk thread. PLEASE try to keep it concise and try not to repeat things that have already been written.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885.html"><b>Magician Talk</b></a><br>It's very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class. They can solo for their entire career fairly well. Because of their pets, they are welcome enough in any group, and at higher levels they get the Malo spell line that makes them even more welcome. There is some concern about the use of pets in higher level groups. Pathing in places can make them more of a danger than a help. And any creature with an AoE fear spell will exclude the use of magician pets. I'm not sure that these issues constitute any sort of imbalance, though. Fixing them, however, would most certainly eliminate any concern that magicians might have about having something to do in raids against the boss mob, or against the high hit point Velious monsters. Having powerful pets gives them the ability to contribute to the combat, regardless of the magic resistance of the monster, or the magicians available mana. <br><br>So, most of what is listed below are essentially minor. The issue of a change to the way rain spells work crosses several classes, though, and is the only real sweeping concern here. The change to the way link death and logging back in works hit magicians pretty hard. The tedium and expense of summoning new items when you go link dead is harsh. <br><br>No Rent Items: We all know what happened when we changed the way players log back into the servers after disconnect, and how that affected magicians (not to mention people holding no rent quest items). The most viable solution for this seems to be making No Rent items disappear on log in instead of log out, and only if the last log in time was more than 30 minutes prior. This would be a perfect solution (and one that I&#8217;ve heard the players suggest a few times).<br><br>Rain Spells: Can we remove the pets from the equation? Just this would probably make them useful without making them too useful. I've looked at the numbers, and adding more waves would probably overpower these spells by a large margin. We might want to look at the resistance on these spells, though. They may be too high.<br><br>New Summoned Proc&#8217;ing Weapons: With the recent changes to the status of pets (making them Pets instead of NPCs) and the fix to the way their weapons proc (and the &#8216;nerf&#8217; of the Sword of Runes) we also mentioned that we would be adding new proc&#8217;ing summoned weapons for them. Perhaps something like this could be a good way to introduce a few situational weapons. <br><br>Pathing: Any continuing improvement on pathing would be a great benefit to magicians. There are several places where the pathing, rather than the actual pet or the zone design intent, is bad enough to exclude the use of a pet.<br>Notes: Get specific zone examples where pathing is at its worst. <br><br>Pets and AoE fear: Pets are unwanted against any enemy that can cast an area of effect fear spell (and those are some of the more important encounters, at least emotionally), because the pet will always flee, and will often run directly into other monsters that the party does not want to engage. It might be nice to give magicians the ability to make their pets immune to fear for short periods of time. It could be debated about letting them make other pets immune to fear. And it will most certainly be expected by the players that immunity to fear would make more sense for necromancer pets than mage pets. But, as always, gameplay has to come before appearances. <br><br>Voceration: Fire and Greater Voceration: Fire: The claim is that these two pets do less damage than the level 29 fire pet. Are they really less useful than the 29th level pet? Can someone check? If it is, should it be? Perhaps another careful examination of these pets is in order&#8230; <br><br>Spell Drops: Could someone look into the 54th level Water Pet Spell (heck, all the 54th level pets) and Blizzard, just to see if they are dropping off the right level monsters? There is a rumor that the water pet is dropping off of lower level mobs in Skyfire. Is that really where it should drop? <br><br>Pet Names: How about letting players pick a pet name (just one per character) and have all of their pets named by that name. It would be no more likely to be abused than the naming of characters, and it would make people with pets much happier. Not to mention it would help diversify the landscape a bit. Or perhaps some other way to allow for more interesting names than the list they are randomly chosen from now.<br><br>Pet Graphics: How about a new graphic for high level magician and enchanter pets, something to match the spectre for the necros. At least can we look into getting an interesting look for the epic pet, something like the original appearance (this thing looked pretty cool the first time out, then something bad happened and it lost its cool looks)? <br><br>Rage of Zomm: How about making it look like a big fat Eye of Zomm? <br><br>DoTs: Why did we give magicians DoT's with Velious? It does seem a bit odd. <br><br>Dyzil's Deafening Decoy: The claim is that it doesn't actually seem to decoy very well. We should up its ability to taunt. I don&#8217;t see a reason that it can&#8217;t be a super taunter. With its low hit points, letting it taunt the heck out of things wouldn&#8217;t seem to overpower it. Though, if it&#8217;s going to be attacked so much maybe we should give it a few more hit points. Also (or maybe instead), perhaps making it more of an escape spell would be a good idea. Give it a very short casting time (2 seconds), so that magicians could summon it in bad situations real quick and then run like heck. (Summary of requests for this spell: A lot more taunt, more hit points, 2 second cast time).<br><br>Higher level pet healing spell: By giving them a better healing pet healing spell (a standard upgrade) at higher levels, we can force them to decide if they want to heal or summon a new one in a tight spot. The last one they get is at 20th level, I think. It&#8217;s a good spell line that seems worthy of continuation. <br><br>Improved Invisibility: Why don&#8217;t magicians get this spell? <br><br>Phantom Armor: Two concerns here. The first is that it uses 4 components! That&#8217;s an awful lot of components to carry around. It would be nice to make the component a single item that costs 4 (or even more) times as much. The second concern is that it is overwritten by Shield of Words. It seems to me that the 52nd level personal magician spell should hold over the 49th level cleric spell. Though the cleric spell seems to have more AC, the mage spell also give additional regen&#8230; <br><br>Aegis of Ro: The players think that this spell is more than rare, that it is not dropping at all. I've also been told by a very few players (one that I can think of) that it does indeed drop off a dragon in Dreadlands. Perhaps a slight increase in the drop rate on this spell would be good. (Note: Obviously we've fixed this one since I wrote this. This spell never was dropping, but is now.}<br><br>Pet Fear Immunity spell: One idea that came in during the necromancer thread spurred me to suggest this. Area of affect fear spells make pets unwanted in some places. How about we give magicians a spell that would allow them to make a pet immune to fear for a short while? (another note: See, the dev team DOES read these threads&#8230;)<br><br>Robe of Conjuration: Both necromancer and magician pantaloons (legs) for caster classes give them mana free level 50 pet buffs (Burnout III, Augment Death), but the necromancer robe has the level 57 Conjure corpse, while the Robe of Conjuration gives the level 49 damage shield. How about changing the magician leggings to the level 56 damage shield?<br><br>Pet Health Bars: It would be nice if the magician could see his pet's health bar at all times. Even better if every party member could see the health bars of all party pets. <br><br>Ok, keep in mind that this list was written a while ago. Obviously some of these items have already been added. And some of them really are not class balance issues (I wrote this up before the idea of starting the class balance threads even existed). So, please, let's only talk about these ideas (if you don't like them or think I've written them incorrectly) and new ones. But please keep in mind, if you know you've stated it before and it is not on this list, that's probably because I purposefully did not add it to the list&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055914.html"><b>Cleric and Warrior Bashing Thread</b></a><br>I'm going to lock this thread solely because of its unpleasant and abrasive title. But I also want you all to know that we will NOT be making warriors and/or clerics obsolete. And threads like this one, created solely to tell one class or another to shut up, are not beneficial to this board. Talk about the potential changes, that's great. But stop attacking each other.</UL>

Kallel Frostreaver sent word of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Back by popular demand, Sanguine Blade will be hosting another all rogue<br>tournement open to all rogues of the Bristlebane server.<br><br>The Time: It will be held on Saturday, February 10th at 3:00pm CST.<br><br>The Place: The Arena<br><br>The Details: We will be setting up brackets like we did at our last<br>tournament in Najena by level:<br><br>Bracket: Entrance Fee:<br><br>Snatcher<br>lvl 10-15 3p<br><br>Filcher<br>lvl 16-21 5p<br><br>Burglar<br>lvl 22-26 10p<br><br>Crook<br>lvl 27-29 15p<br><br>Snitch<br>lvl 30-33 20p<br><br>Bandit<br>lvl 34-37 25p<br><br>Thief<br>lvl 38-41 30p<br><br>Ring leader<br>lvl 42-44 35p<br><br>Masterthief<br>lvl 45-47 40p<br><br>Mastermind<br>lvl 48-50 50p<br><br>Nightlord<br>lvl 51-54 65p<br><br>Overlord<br>lvl 55-58 75p<br><br>Bristlebanes' Shadow<br>lvl 59-60 100p<br><br>Prizes will be 100% of all the entrance fees in the bracket. For the lower<br>brackets, there will be a choice of a items out of guild inventory that can<br>be taken as a prize in place of 50% of the purse. (Would like to offer prize<br>instead for all brackets, but we don't really have anything in inventory<br>that would interest a lvl 50+ rogue)<br><br>The rules of combat are as follows:<br><br>1. Fight naked<br>- allowed to wear 2 pieces of equipment per lvl difference to compensate<br>higher ATK, HP, AC of higher lvl's of same bracket.<br><br>2. FS weapons only<br>- this is to avoid exp loss with dot type proc'ing weapons, and advantanges<br>of special weapons.<br><br>3. Range weapons are allowed.<br><br>4. Shield allowed: for those who prefer shield versus weapon in secondary<br>slot.<br><br>5. Bandages allowed<br><br>6. No buffs<br><br>7. No magic healing during combat.<br><br>8. Poison - allowed to be used with the exception of DoT poisons like Snake<br>and Putrid Bane. (Burglar bracket and up ONLY)<br><br>These rules will ensure the winner relies on combat skills, instead of<br>better equipment. Anyone found to be dueling outside these rules will<br>forfeit their match.<br><br>The guild will provide a choice of FS weapons to combatants. However, each<br>is responsible for bringing their own bandages and range weapons should they<br>choose to employ them.<br><br>Pairings will be set randomly by the event organizers with winners advancing<br>to the next round.<br><br>This tournament is open to non-guild rogues as well. Please spread the word<br>to your rogue friends throughout Norrath.<br><br><a href="mailto:kallel@mail.com">Registration for the tournement</a> is<br>required.  Simply click on the above text and send your name and what<br>bracket you believe you will be fighting in at tourny time, to myself via<br>e-mail.  Depending on the way the individual brackets are filled, walk-ons<br>MAY NOT be accepted into the tournement.
