The only reason that someone would drag off a corpse would be to restore his life. Friend or not, that NPC doesn't want you to do that. Just because you are a friend of the NPC and the dead guy is your friend, that does not make the dead guy the friend of the NPC. That is an illogical conclusion. <br><br>But the real reason for the corpse dragging thing is because people could use this feature to bypass parts of the game that a feature isn't supposed to let them pass. The choices were, basically, remove the feature entirely, never implement interesting new gameplay that the feature would make worthless, or modify the feature. The right choice was to modify the feature.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037944.html"><b>Client Font Size in EQClient.ini</b></a><br>The rumor is that font sizing is something that we'll be adding in the very near future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037540.html"><b>CD Key</b></a><br>Just to repeat what Bloodsage said, it's a very good idea to keep your CD key (the whole CD, really).

Alan announced some new changes to the disciplines today in an announcement posted to the Gameplay Board.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037502.html">complete post</a>:<UL><i>We've decided to change a few of the new disciplines. These changes will go into effect with the emergency patch (though this is not the reason for the patch, just something that we are slipping in while we're at it).<br><br>Resistant &#8211; At 30th level the resistance gain will be +3. This will increase at increments until 50th level, where it will reach its maximum of +10.<br><br>The Ranger True Shot &#8211; The chance of hitting with a bow while using this discipline will increase, along with the other benefits.<br><br>Shadowknights Unholy Aura &#8211; along with the 25% increase in damage, this discipline will also make the Harm Touch less resistable, along the lines of a Lifetap resistance.<br><br>Paladins Holy Forge &#8211; the ability to critical with this discipline in use will be doubled. It will, of course, still only affect the undead.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>

Creating a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037509.html">new thread</a> on the Gameplay Board, Alan gave the following update concerning Innate Resistances:<UL><i>Another change that is going in with this patch (again, not the reason for the patch, just an extra), will be a change to the way innate resistances work.<br><br>Some of you may remember about a year ago when we boosted the innate resistance for certain classes. It turns out that, because these were created before the ability to gain levels beyond 50, these resistances were not being calculated properly for most classes as they passed level 50.<br><br>This means that, once this is fixed, all classes with these resistances will see an increase in their innate resistance bonus that may be as high as 11 points.<br><br>The exception is warriors, whose resistance bonus was working just fine.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>

This means that those of you with Velious accounts can't take screen shots right now. We will turn them back on with the patch this Thursday. <br><br>Sorry about that&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037426.html"><b>Inaccurate Info on SoV Box</b></a><br>Yes, we noticed that too... a bit too late.

That's true. We also believe that having that many subscribers does indicate that a lot of people are enjoying the game. The only place where your figures were correct (actually, a bit high) is when you calculated that about 76,000 people are playing EverQuest during peak hours. I think that's a pretty large number, and that alone indicates that EverQuest is a successful product. <br><br>And, yes, we think that EverQuest is a great game full of good challenge, content and expansions. <br><br>As for those that are anticipating the 'next big challenge'&#8230; I was just at an EB today that had sold their 120 copies of Scars of Velious in only a few hours. <br><br>I had nothing to do with the building of the game. If I had, though, I would be extremely proud of that kind of response from the customers. I think the team has created a great product.

Some quests will give you an item that requires a whole inventory slot (one of your main slots). If you do not have an open slot the item will fall to the ground. We all know that items that fall to the ground are not secure, and are not subject to reimbursement.

A new <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml">Producer Letter</a> is up on the official site.  Written by Velious Producer Jeff Butler, this letter announces that Velious is officially launched:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>On behalf of the entire EverQuest Team past and present, and everyone here at Sony Online Entertainment, I proudly announce the launch of the second EverQuest expansion - The Scars of Velious. <br><br>Created in little over half the time of the previous expansion, and with a significantly larger development team, The Scars of Velious adds 19 challenging new zones to the world of Norrath, including two new Planes. In addition to the new zones, Velious includes over 150 new armor textures, helmets, and weapons for player characters, and an enhanced user interface. Also introduced are many new creatures and monsters, most notably the Coldain dwarves, Giants, and Dragons of Velious. The expansion is specifically designed to challenge the majority of EverQuest players, who are between 30 and 60th level of experience.<br><br>It seems that just a short while ago that I had the pleasure of announcing the launch of the first EverQuest expansion. Our desire to surpass the success of The Ruins of Kunark spurred us to set ambitious goals for The Scars of Velious. As the months of development passed the team overcame what seemed at the onset to be a daunting series of challenges, not the least of which included a tight schedule. We are humbly pleased to present The Scars of Velious without compromise or concession, and we hope that it meets and exceeds your expectations for value and quality in an EverQuest product<br><br>Returning for the second expansion were several experienced members of the original EverQuest and Ruins of Kunark teams. Their expertise combined with that of the veteran EverQuest Live team, made this challenging project possible, and allowed us to take this expansion to a new level of immersive detail. I would like to personally thank them for their unfailing dedication to excellence. It has been an inspiration and an honor to be a part of The Scars of Velious team.<br><br>We encourage you to be among the first in the unfolding history of Norrath to board the amazing Gnomish Icebreaker ship and venture to the frozen continent of Velious. There you will be exploring a land where no adventurer has ever before set foot, where you can choose sides in the struggle between titanic forces locked in an ages-old conflict and view wonders never before seen by the inhabitants of Norrath.<br><br>We expect that the launch of The Scars of Velious expansion will proceed smoothly, but we will maintain our Customer Service staff here at Sony Online Entertainment around the clock to insure that everything performs as expected. As we anticipate customers in record number over the next few days, we ask for your understanding should any problems arise. We will do our utmost to resolve any issues quickly, and with a minimum of downtime or inconvenience.<br><br>In closing, I would like to again thank our loyal players for their support. The ongoing development of EverQuest and its expansions has been a profound pleasure for all of us here at Sony Online Entertainment, and we hope that you will join us in The Scars of Velious, and as EverQuest&#8217;s future unfolds. As always, we look forward to seeing you in game.<br><br>Welcome to EverQuest: The Scars of Velious! You&#8217;re in our world now!<br><br>For the EverQuest Team<br><br>Jeff Butler<br>Producer<br>EverQuest Live and EverQuest: The Scars of Velious</i></UL>

I'm starting to receive reports that the Scars of Velious has been spotted at retail stores across the country.  For those who didn't preorder it your best bets are to stop by Software, Etc., Best Buy, Circuit City and other similar vendors.<br><br>I'll try stopping by my local software source to see if the anticipated expansion has even reached the "rural" areas of the country. ;)

Brad McQuaid made several comments about the Scars of Velious expansion recently on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037021.html">a thread located on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><I>Just letting everyone know that Scars of Velious should start to appear in US stores tomorrow, and be in most stores by the end of the week. <br><br>I'm not sure about outside of the US, but we do have much better distribution now. I'll try to find out. <br><br>-Brad <br><br>ps. If you have any Velious sightings, feel free to post them on this thread :)</i></UL>Follow-up post #1:<UL><i>For those in San Diego, remember the team will be at the EB in UTC on Wednesday to say hi, sign boxes, give away posters, etc. <br><br>See you there :)<br><br>And stevemorley, yep, I've been shown quite a tour through the varous zones in Velious, and it's pretty darn amazing stuff :)  I think the teams have really outdone themselves this time. <br><br>For example, I'm really happy to see traps! (Especially after having so many Rogues upset with me for so long :)<br><br>Also, wow, are there some great stories and quests! We've seen a lot of posts asking for more stories, more RP, and more depth... well, Velious is a HUGE step forward in that direction -- there are all sorts of new scripted events involving players and NPCs using some advanced AI enchancements we managed to get implemented. <br><br>I can't wait to hear what you all think :)<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>Here's follow-up post #2:<UL><i>Tiervalen: Essentially, the majority of our player base is heading into their 30s, and with the backstory of Velious describing it as a pretty nasty and exotic place, we decided to make the expansion targetted for levels 35-60. <br><br>One could also argue that new players and casual players (for the sake of argument, those below 35 I suppose) still, by definition, have tons of already existing content to explore and devour. <br><br>All that said, I definitely hear what you're saying and it's also a concern on our part (we definitely want to provide new content for ALL EQ players, new or old, casual or hard core, RPers or power gamers) To that end, we've both short and long term goals: <br><br>We still have quite a few dungeons to revamp, and those include low, mid and high (including the planes). With Velious in stores tomorrow, you'll see the Expansion and Live teams move on pretty quickly to these revamps (although there will undoubtedly be some clean up and we do have the holidays approaching). <br><br>Also, I'd like to see at least one (perhaps two) new free zones launch during 2001, and I think we should focus on low to mid levels. <br><br>And lastly, should there be another expansion post-Velious (and while I'm certainly not announcing anything... well, with 310,000 subscribers and growing, I see a long future ahead of EQ :), we'll most likely target all levels (1-60), similar to what we did with Kunark. <br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

Brad quickly responded to a post concerning the status of MIP Mapping.  The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037080.html">following is his complete response</a>:<UL><I>With the last patch (or maybe the one before that), we decided to turn off mip mapping for everything but the world (in other words, it's not on for characters and objects).<br><br>We did this because mip mapping all those textures was causing performance problems and pauses for many players. That, and we really think subjectively that the advantages of mip mapping are for the most part apparent and beneficial only on world geometry.<br><br>That said, you seem to disagree. We'd love to hear some other feedback on this. Perhaps we could provide several options (for example, no mip mapping, mip mapping world only, mip mapping all textures) were there a demand. <br><br>Let us know, and maybe Rowyl can look into it and let us know if such options are possible.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>

Right now the suggestion is to drag that window out of the way as much as possible before closing it. That's for now. We're fixing it so that the box will go away properly as soon as we can. <br><br>We're also aware of the second bug too. You won't lose them money, it's still in a buffer someplace. It will come back when you zone or log back in. We're fixing that one too.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036843.html"><b>Using "Nazi" to Describe People</b></a><br>Ok everyone, enough. <br><br>Let's stop using 'nazi' to describe anyone here. It's a very offensive choice of terminology. Consider doing so worthy of a warning from here on out. I have no problem with people talking about our policies, even if you don't like them. But using terminology that is designed only to offend people like this is something that I'm not going to allow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036852.html"><b>Corpse Dragging</b></a><br>Airtreader wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Sigh, your not seeing the picture Vi has dancing in their tiny brains.<br>player dies in some $oV zone, cant recover corpse.<br>necro and player zone in, necro targets player, summons corpse.<br>necro is summoned to the feet of 5-6 dragons, chewed up and spit out. ]</i></font><br><br>I pretty much count on that as being how it happens.

The troops were gathered in Cabilis and much sparring and <br>excitement was built within the arena.  At 3PM PST/ 6PM EST the call to <br>arms was given and the 7th Legion was met at the large statue some distance <br>from Cabilis.  Each guild lined up across from each other and finally the <br>signal was given<br><br>Each guild fought hard but the numerical superiority of the Iksar was too <br>great for the brave adventurers from the Other Continents.  Both guild <br>leaders were slain and much blood, Iksar and fleshy filled the soil.  In <br>the end the sole 7th Legion member surviving had to flee.

Here are the latest posts from Alan from off of the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035745-2.html"><b>Titanic-sized Mage Issue Response</b></a><br>I'm sorry it took me so long to respond to this post. It's taken me three days just to write this response. It's been pretty busy in here&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How was Unbreakable, Absor?]</i></font> <br><br>Never managed to see it&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Sword of Runes]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for seeing that as a fix. I do. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Call of the Hero <br><br>However, Verant has said that the aggro will not be cleared all the time. This has interesting effects: <br><br>1) The groupmate will be pulled out of the situation, but likely still in danger. Since the groupmate may still be on the hate list, the mob may give chase or summon the groupmate back.]</i></font> <br><br>Yup <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) The mage and groupmate can use CoH to pull a mob they otherwise could not pull. <br><br>It's this last one that's interesting to me. Does Verant realize that this change will give groups with CoH-equipped mages the ability to pull big mobs more easily? I think clearing the hate list is the right thing to do. The mob believes the player to have gated, unless the summoned player is within the normal aggro range of the mob.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, it could be used that way, I suppose. But the chance of the hate list not being cleared is supposed to be pretty low&#8230; it might be faster to pull it the normal way. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And thanks for fixing the pet suicide!]</i></font> <br><br>For you, anything. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Spell Skill Class<br><br>-----------------<br>I see Verant continuing the evocation path with magicians. This is disheartening. We are conjurers. Let the wizards have their evocation. Long ago I asked GZ why spells like "Rain of Spikes" were evocation. His answer? Paraphrase: "It was likely a mistake, but we can't change it now since people may have based their specialization on it being evocation." Sigh, I went to magician school. Mages should conjure heavy and sharp flying objects rather than rely on fire so heavily IMHO. Why are so many of our spells (with Kunark and current Velious spells) fire-based?]</i></font> <br><br>Umm&#8230; I dunno? I'm, again, not really going to comment about Velious spells. But from reading the &#8211; oh so excellent &#8211; Prima Strat Guide, it does suggest that magicians should either specialize in conjuration or in evocation, and that many mages choose evocation. <br><br>Is that really how it should be? I dunno. But GZ is right about it being a little late to change horses mid-stream. I'll mention this comment to the folks here and let them think about it, though for whatever is in Velious it's likely too late to fiddle with that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Rain Spells<br>------------<br>Why do things that can't be affected by these spells reduce their effectiveness? I'm a magician...I'm going to have a pet up nearly all the time. Why is it that the rain loses a wave to my pet when my pet can't be harmed by the rain? Our rain spells are efficient only when all waves have a chance to hit. We pay for that efficiency with a resistance check on each wave and the risks of aggroing more mobs with its AE nature. Totally losing a wave on our pet makes these spells mana inefficient and is one of the main reasons they are not more heavily used. If you can't "fix" the pet problem, would you consider making the rain spells target only rather than AE? Again, the resistance checks on each wave should balance the spells.]</i></font> <br><br>It's just as easy to argue the other way, that pets should be damaged because they are obviously being hit by the spell&#8230; <br><br>The real way to look at this is from the game mechanic point of view. Is having the pet take a wave making the spell too weak? Would making him not hit make the spell too strong? Honestly, I don't know. I do plan to bring this up, but probably not until after the holidays. I know that's not fast enough, but it's as fast as it's gonna happen. Verant deserves a holiday too&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: PBAoE<br>-----<br>Thanks for Scintilation! I love frying those undead lowbies that think they can gang up and melee me into the ground. This spell isn't useful for things my level, but if it were, it'd overpower the class.]</i></font> <br><br>Cool. Thanks. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: DOT Spells<br>----------<br>I know, you won't talk about Velious...But with the CD gold and the release around the corner, I thought you might speak a little more on the tpoc. Why are we getting weak DOTs? I'm not a shaman or necro. I don't want to waste mana and time on a DOT when I could do the same or more damage instantly. <br><br>The tradeoff for DOTs is typically more damage, for more time. More time, same damage makes no sense to me. Shamans can debuff a mob to lengthen the fight, giving their DOT time to work. Necros can fear a mob, giving their DOT time to work. Magicians have no means of lengthening a fight other than to cast more slowly. In fact, the longer a fight continues, the worse shape magicians are in, typically. <br><br>Please, reconsider DOTs...or make them more powerful for the trade off of time.]</i></font> <br><br>Umm&#8230; Let's wait on this. I'm really, really not talking about Velious stuff. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Fun Spells<br>----------<br>Bristlebane's Bundle...ah...what a fun spell! Seriously, having a summoned party pack is great! (You'd be surprised how many high levels I've tricked into spinning themselves with the bottle, heh). A few Velious spells like this would be great! In fact, as the DOTs are currently listed, take them all away. Give us things we can have fun with...Voice Graft, anyone?]</i></font> <br><br>I'm all for fun spells too. I'm one of those people that tends to buy the fun spells first and worry about combat spells later. Eye of Zomm rocks! Again, I'll make this suggestion to the team, but it's probably too late to make any changes to Velious (I know, it might not have been when you first posted&#8230;) <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Pet Graphics<br>------------<br>Rage of Zomm: Make it an eye...please? It would be something different to look at that fits the Zomm line. We can't hand the Rage weapons anyway, so why make it an elemental? Eyes are in the global file already, right?]</i></font> <br><br>Very good idea. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: High Level Elementals: We were told that there was no room in the global file. Sorry, mages. Spectres yes, new elementals no. Ok, fine. Now there's 3 more gods in the global file that I have yet to see in game. I guess gods have to be able to go to any zone. Ok, fine. Sigh.]</i></font> <br><br>Also a nice idea. I have no idea how much space there is (or isn't) for new globals. I do know that enchanters want some new stuff too. Both ideas are on my list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Linkdeath<br>---------<br>Absor was incorrect in stating that it has always been the way it is now. In fact, it was changed when it was discovered that people were banking summoned arrows and food...or forcing linkdeath to save it (oh my!). I do not believe that I should be able to summon the equivalent of dragon loot (a Treasure Hunter's Satchel, for example). But really, did a few banked summoned items throw off the game balance? <br><br>My inference is that Verant would rather punish all magicians and shaman 100% of the time than risk a few percent of players who are willing to linkdeath themselves to save summoned items. Isn't there a solution that meets both ends? You've already prevented summoned items from being banked. Put code into the /q and camp commands that trashes summoned items in a player's inventory and leave it at that. If someone is willing to physically disconnect a wire or reboot their machine in the middle of an EQ session to save some arrows, let them! Or consider this option: make it a 10% chance that things will poof on linkdeath...that will prevent people from using the summoned bags to lug around all their good loot, yet give us a fair shot at keeping our items most of the time.]</i></font> <br><br>There have been several suggestions for changes to the way linkdeath works with summoned items. Again, it's on my list. Hopefully after the holidays we'll be able to tackle my growing list&#8230;<br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Elemental Pets<br>--------------<br>Earth and Air: Nice! Thanks!]</i></font> <br><br>Yer weclome. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Water: I wish I could say. Are you sure the drop has been fixed for 54 Water?]</i></font> <br><br>So I have been told. But I haven't taken it off my list yet&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Fire: Argh! A 52 and 58 pet that casts low level spells, cancels debuffs, has a newbie fire shield, gates and can't melee to save its life or mine? Verant has told us that we just haven't found the right use for this pet. I'd bet I've logged more magician hours than ANY Verant staffer, but perhaps I'm just dumb. Please, please, please. Take a serious look at this pet! I don't know any magician who would take the current pet over the existing, properly buffed 49 and under pet model.]</i></font> <br><br>Also on my list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Power of Pets: We've been told that our pets are more powerful than ever thanks to the DW bug fix a year ago. What Verant fails to mention is that fire, air and water now hit as slowly as earth. The differences in attack speed is now gone. Fire dished out more damage before, allowing it to finish fights faster than earth, now it doesn't. The differences in pets was narrowed greatly by this silent nerf. Just a point to make that pet variety got narrower. Narrower is bad.]</i></font> <br><br>Are you talking about the supposed 'nerf' that was supposed to have happened last week? I hate to repeat myself, but there wasn't one&#8230; The reduction of the procing will certainly make pets a bit weaker, even with the dual wielding change. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Decoy Pet<br>---------<br>This pet doesn't seem to be much of a decoy. As has been pointed out, it doesn't taunt very well. The whole point behind this pet is to get mobs to lock onto it! It should do that or it won't be useful.]</i></font> <br><br>On my list now (I'm sure you're tired of hearing that by now). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Rage of Zomm<br>------------<br>This pet is interesting. It's at least some variety, although I'm convinced that Zomm was a sissy mage that died at an early age. I wish this thing could survive more than a single ripostle. Would you consider increasing it's health? Give it half the health of an elemental. It is not dishing out twice as much damage as an elemental, so this would not seem to overpower the pet. If not, would you consider lowering the casting time to 2 seconds? Yes, 2 seconds. This would allow us a chance at summoning a pet to distract something that's beating us...even if not for very long.]</i></font> <br><br>Again, I'll bring it up. I'm not familiar with this pet, so I'll talk to someone about it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Summoned Items<br>--------------<br>"Well, one man's junk..." is a newbie's dream? Nope. It's junk to most newbies too. The Sword of Runes is unqiue because of its proc. Other summons that proc that level of damage would be awesome! It'd give me options. I don't want to summon weapons that make warriors drool. What about weapons that proc a small DoT? Weapons whose proc is a serious taunt? Weapons that make wood elf women rain down from the sky?]</i></font> <br><br>It may be a little while before we start talking about new procing summoned weapons. I'll certainly let you all know when we get to it, I'll probably ask for ideas. <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Pet Heals<br>---------<br>I wish we had them when I was low enough for them to matter. They really added some dimension to the class. Why not give us a high level heal? I can resummon a pet in 10 - 12 seconds at 51+. Let me CH my own pet in 10 seconds for 500 mana. That's a lot of mana...more than a cleric's CH (and of course, limited to the pet). Now I have a choice. With 500 mana do I DD, try to summon a new pet or heal my own?]</i></font> <br><br>Sounds interesting. Again, it's on my list&#8230; (yikes) <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Buffs & Stuff<br>-------------<br>Invisibility: Why didn't magicians get improved invisibility? Normally, we get what other casters get with the exception of things like root and stun for which we must rely on pets. However, my pets don't invis me (thankfully, since they'd become despondent and suicide).]</i></font> <br><br>Er&#8230; that's a Velious thing&#8230; but my answer would be, I don't know&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Phantom Armor: Woot! Finally, a reason for casting it! Now, two things...can you make it use one of something 4 times as expensive as the agate? No? What about one of something 10 times as expensive? I'd prefer that...most magicians 51+ would. Also, why does Sheild of Words overwrite this? If you can't let me have both my Phantom Armor and the cleric Shield of Words, then make Phantom Armor higher on the list so the cleric gets "Your spell did not take hold" -- I hate losing my armor to well meaning clerics.]</i></font> <br><br>You mean you want it to cost more? I don't know the current cost, so perhaps you're being sarcastic (and I hate missing good sarcasm&#8230; :)  Again, I'll ask about the stacking on this spell, and the cost, once I figure out what you mean&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Epic Quest<br>----------<br>I need a no drop rare from the Minions of Hate? Ack! The "minion" is an 8-day timed spawn. He'll pop 45 times in a year (slightly more due to servers going down and resetting the timer). The general consensus is that the staff is dropped about 10% of the time. Ouch. Even if I can raise an army and get this minion every time, it will take between 8 and 80 days with the average being in the middle of that just to get this one item. Note the NPC says "minions of Hate" ... was the drop to be moved from where it is to the minions of its current owner?]</i></font> <br><br>I've mentioned this elsewhere. The 'minions' thing is in there in anticipation of possible changes to Hate. Even when (if) it is changed, the minions will not be easier to deal with than the current holder of the item. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I need burning embers from a notable member of wurm kind? Well, eventually this will be found. I hope this really is dropping. There are a lot of people looking for it.]</i></font> <br><br>I hope so too&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In Closing<br>----------<br>I hope you understand that people like me make posts like this because we care about the game. We enjoy playing it and truly want to improve it. I don't want to become Uber. If I did, I'd go back to playing any number of games I can walk all over.]</i></font> <br><br>I do understand. We are all aware that if you really hated the game you wouldn't even be posting here, you'd be playing elsewhere. And I appreciate your feedback. I'm sorry that so many of your suggestions are on my 'list'. I know that sounds like a put-off, and it is kind of. But I will talk with people about these issues. You'll just have to be very patient about it&#8230; I hope that doesn't offend you.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036680-2.html"><b>Corpse Dragging is instant argro in SoV zones?</b></a><br>Ok, here's a bit more information. <br><br>The idea is that there are some places where, with a good faction, characters can travel unharmed. Some of those places are very, very dangerous to those that are not aligned with the folks that live there. These will be major adventuring/hunting zones for those that don&#8217;t mind not being able to wander around free there and talk to the locals. <br><br>We really like it that way, but setting things up like that leads to a simple problem. Folks that are hated by the natives can make assaults on them and have their 'friends' who are well liked by the locals simply drag their corpses to safety, right in front of the people they were trying to kill. There are other potential abuses of this situation that I won't describe&#8230; <br><br>So, to maintain the risk of fighting in these difficult places, we had to have these mobs get upset when you drag their kills off. And, yes, rogues and invisible types will have to be a lot more careful doing their recoveries once they actually lift that corpse up on their shoulders and start to scamper away. <br><br>You will not have a problem dragging your own corpse (at least not any more of a problem than you would normally have). So if you accidentally fall to your death and you are friendly with the natives, you will be able to drag your own corpse all over the zone with no additional problems. But then, you won't need a safe spot either&#8230; <br><br>This will make corpse recovery a little bit more difficult in the few places where this rule is used. But we see this as a necessary and useful inclusion. We wanted to tell you about it before hand to help reduce the number of people surprised by this addition.<br>--<br>Yikes! <br><br>Correction on my last post. <br><br>Dragging a corpse will not make you more visible. So if the creature sees through invis, it will still see you dragging a corpse. If it does not, dragging a corpse will not increase your visibility to that creature. <br><br>Sorry for the goof on that. Hopefully I caught it fast enough.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036913.html"><b>Velious a "Bug-Fix" Add-on?</b></a><br>ProppaT wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "My only gripe is that it's not new content...it's a fix to a bug."]</i></font> <br><br>No, it's new content.

Alan made the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036950.html">following plea for patience</a> on the Gameplay Board this afternoon:<UL><i>Please be patient with us over the next few days. As Velious goes live we are expecting to be very busy, both on the servers and with tech support. We will be doing everything we can to keep things running smoothly for everyone. But if something untoward happens, please understand that our staff will be working hard to help you out. We are anticipating a rather large increase in volume on the servers, in petitions and on our tech support phone lines. Velious is an exciting new adventure for everyone, with people rushing out to see the new lands. Servers will probably see a lot more activity than they are used to, and they already see a lot. So will our customer support personnel. Please, be patient with them during this busy time.<br><br>And happy holidays to everyone!<br><br>Alan</I></UL>
