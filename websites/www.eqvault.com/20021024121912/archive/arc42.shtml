Check out the latest information from Alan he posted today on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000101.html"><b>/Roll Rigged?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I don't have any idea of the validity of this but since it's a pretty serious allegation I'd appreciate an official word. I was grouped recently in LGuk and group conversation turned to how to random on items. I was surprised to hear someone say that the eqclient.ini file could have a line added in to it to produce a specific random result. (I might have the file name wrong, but I think you get the gist.) It was suggested to random on a different number such as /random 300 or even vary things for each drop through a single /random 100 1000 to set the upper bound of each group /random. All of which seems like a waste of time as it would seem to me that /random should be easily enough safe from external player tampering and we should be able to make due with the usual /random 100 without fear of fraud. <br><br>It seems rediculous, but better to hear direct from the programmers. Is there a backdoor method client side that would allow someone's /random 100 roll to be jiggered? Or is this just cyber-urban myth? <br><br>Inquiringly yours,<br>Aeloryn 51 Illusionist<br>Quellious ]</i></font><br><br>Aeloryn. <br>Thanks for sending this comment in. I spoke with Ryan Elam (one of our programmers) and he stated that there was a time in the past that with a lot of work, someone would be able to predict what their random rolls would be. This has since been changed. The seed generator has been changed and made much more random. So I don't believe you have anything to worry about in terms of random rolls being able to be predicted or players receiving high rolls regularly by changing anything in the eqclient.ini file.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000102.html"><b>Leatherfoot Scandels</b></a><br>Evyndr wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Recently over at the Safe house these were a topic of conversation and being a fellow Halfling I am simply in awe that a nice item like this would hide our wonderful feet this is our defining feature :)  Could you please make them no visible graphic instead of leather I would bet if you asked any Halfling in game they would agree we love our fur a flying :)  Thanks ]</i></font><br><br>That make a ton of sense. We'll remove the graphic from this item.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000103.html"><b>What Makes a Zone Great?</b></a><br>Once again I asked my esteemed colleagues what questions they would like to ask of all of you. Now most of us were all questioned out after the Fan Faire, but that didn't stop us. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: <br><br>I'd like to know this: <br><br>If loot was not a factor, what do the players find interesting about zones? What would they like to see? <br><br>Dave Nevala<br>Artist ]</i></font><br><br>Awesome question. <br><br>So what sort of things do you find interesting about the zones that you like. We're not talking about the Phat Lewtz here, we're talking about other things. For example, I love the neon and sort of smutty feel of Neriak. It conveys a sense of the people that live there very well. And I hear endless raves about the bar fights that them silly dwarves have. <br><br>It could be about the kinds of battles that take place in certain zones. It could be about the geometry of the area&#8230; whatever strikes your fancy. <br><br>Just use the Submit Comments button and let us know what you think. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Changing Religions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: <br>Absor, <br><br>As far as changing religions is concerned; how hard would it be to make it only change your faction with the clerics/druids/whatever of the appropriate factions for thw two dieties involved? Another thing; I can see how a shadowknight shouuld not be permitted to change his or her diety to Tunare, for example, but there are a couple gods that have SK's. Since I cannot really see a character being a Cazic Thule or Innoruuk worshipping SK changing to worshipping Erollisi Marr, and still being a SK, I would not expect that character to be able to make such a change. But, don't both Cazic and Innoruuk have SK's that worship them? Why would an SK not be able to switch, with a long and involved quest? <br><br>Here's another idea, one that kinda ties in to changing dieties, but dosen't have to. There are imbued items, that are diety specific; why not spells (not just the imbue spells) that are diety specific? Maybe wizards worshipping Solusek Ro would get better fire DD spells, for example. <br><br>Astroshak ]</i></font><br><br>I'm certainly not saying that allowing a change of religion isn't possible (though there may very well be issues that I don't know about), I'm just saying that at the very least it's messy. <br><br>And the problem with deity specific spells would be balance. How in the world would we be able to create a new spell for each god that is unique and relatively well balanced with others? While I think we all love the idea, the amount of trouble that balancing just one such spell for each god would be a nightmare. And even if we were to produce a set of perfectly balanced spells, there would be no end to the complaints from worshippers of one god that really would rather have the spell that we assigned to some other god&#8230; <br><br>It's a time consuming nightmare. A great idea, but a total nightmare. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: All right buster.. ;-) Since you brought it up again.. I previously submitted a question about bards, Veeshan, and the Claws of Veeshan faction group over in Velious. I understand if the information you are allowed to give on it is extremely limited, but why is it that bardic worshippers of Veeshan are threatening by default to the residents of Skyshrine.. from a roleplaying perspective this makes no sense. The bard has dedicated his or her life to espousing the virtues of dragonkind through deed and song, yet until they have slain many a giant, they will still be killed on sight by those one would think are allies.. <br><br>Just trying to get some consistency. =) <br><br>Thanks! <br><br>Alustrae ]</i></font><br><br>Well, there is actually a reason for this, but you're not gonna like it&#8230; :)<br><br>The main reason is for gameplay purposes. We wanted all player characters to have to choose one of the 'paths', not be forced into one (no matter how logical it might seem). <br><br>As for the in-game reason, the residents of Skyshrine are very disconnected from the comings and goings of the lesser creatures. And, as with all residents of Velious, they have been cut off from contact with all other continents for long enough not to care much for, or fully understand, the way that politics and religion have developed outside of Velious. Their main concern has been survival and competition with their rivals, nothing much else matters to them. <br><br>There's a ton of consistency there. But you'll still have to convince those big fellows that you're a friend, not a foe.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>Populations and Economies</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Everyone talks about inflation, sorry, I do NOT see it. I remember looting my first forrest loop, I kept it, but the price at the time was one K platinum, this week on Fennin ro they are about 500 plat per. THIS is inflation?? And this happens with EVERY item of value I loot, if I don't sell it and FAST, its value will plumet fast. There are a FEW items that maintain their value, mostly quest items that give the SAME xp NOW as six months ago, but these are few and far between, MOST on Fennin ro LOSE value rather quickly.<br>Clearbrook Spelljammer<br>druid 50<br>Fennin ro ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, what tends to happen is a reduction of the value of money and older items. Because these two things are rarely removed from the economy, they lose their value as more and more of them enter the world. New items, therefore, because they are more unique and because cash is more readily available, can sometimes have prices that seem very 'inflated'. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Chadrack's Idea would not require 14, or even 3 new items for each customizable piece of equipment, just one. It can still be ALL/ALL, it is simply now NODROP: it can only be used by the person for whome it is customized. <br><br>However, that still is doubling the number of such items in the game. <br><br>Zambus ]</i></font><br><br>Good thinking, I missed that. The armor would not need to have a size change if it will also become No-Drop. So, while it might make sense to change the tag to represent the new 'fitted' armor, it isn't needed. We could just label the new piece as 'fitted Soandso's Armor of Stuff'. <br><br>Thanks for catching that. <br><br>Hysswar wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Somehow I find I am writing this for the 5th time and I never see anything about it, everyone there must totaly hate this idea, but I am hoping that it is just overlooked everytime I enter it :)<br><br>One simple way to handle this. Double bank capacity (I only put this in for people who will cry about not keping 2 sets of items, I have enough room with it now to do this), make everything not spell related, trade related, food related, or non-magic NO DROP. That's it. Now people have to group to get the uber item since no one will be selling it. People won't be farming items, since they can't sell it (ebay or in game). The only possible way to twink a character is with player made goods. Why isn't this tried on the new PvP server, heck it would take care of the looting of items at the same time, and even leave some items lootable. ]</i></font><br><br>Making everything No-Drop would solve any problems with the economy. Unfortunately, it would do so by eliminating the economy. <br><br>There would be no trade at all between characters, except for the items you mentioned, making the player-based economy disappear. This isn't something that we want to happen. We try to use the No-Drop and Lore tags only to restrict very specific items. Doing so for the every item would probably be far too extreme.</UL>

Kenarden Silknote brings us this report:<BLOCKQUOTE>RIOTS IN QEYNOS AS PLAGUE SPREADS<br>by Kenarden Silknote<br>Tholuxe Paells server<br><br>QEYNOS: The Qeynos Guards were restoring order this morning after a night of<br>rioting that left six dead, including the Priest of Discord. The riots<br>started after rumours reached the city of plague in the Karanas.<br><br>A guard spokesman said: "A large number of heavily armed adventurers<br>assembled in front of the city gates, in the belief that the Blackburrow<br>Gnolls were about to attack the city.<br><br>"Some of them even claimed that a dragon had been sighted in the West<br>Karanas.<br><br>"The gnolls never arrived, and the adventurers rampaged through North<br>Qeynos, killing  indiscriminately."<br><br>A local businessman, Sneed Galliway, said he had feared for his daughter's<br>life.<br><br>"I was ready to die in defence of my overpriced merchandise, but I was<br>terrified that the rioters would harm my daughter, Tanlyn. Those adventurers<br>should be ashamed of themselves. They were so full of talk about how they<br>would work together and defend the city, regardless of guild or race. And<br>then they turned on us, the people they were supposed to protect," he said.<br><br>Meanwhile, the threefold plague continues to spread unchecked in the North<br>and West Karanas. The trees and crops have developed a sickly green hue, and<br>rabid animals howl at the moon in pain and hunger. The road is littered with<br>the bodies of unwary travellers.<br><br>I spoke to one of the farmers, who said his crops were dying as a result of<br>a terrible green mist and swarms of small green beetles that ate everything<br>in their path. I was attacked by several of these 'swarmlings' on the road<br>to Qeynos. They could easily kill an inexperienced traveller.<br><br>The farmer said: "The followers of Bertoxxulous want revenge for the<br>execution of Mordavin Telase, one of their high ranking priests. Mark my<br>words, this plague has been released by the Bloodsabres, allied with the<br>Dark Reflection."<br><br>There could still be hope, however. There is a prophecy in Qeynos. It is<br>said that a small girl will step forward, and tell the beleaguered city how<br>to end the plague. But no-one knows when she will be appear, or if she is<br>just another bard's tale, like the gnoll invasion and the dragon of the<br>Karanas.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Kanae brings us this letter:<BLOCKQUOTE>A great evil has befallen the Plains of Karana (well, at least on<br>Morell-Thule, it has)!<br><br>A friend and I crossed the great wooden bridge into the Northern Plains of<br>Karana to find the sky green with tainted rain! The entire landscape, once<br>so beautiful and peaceful, now held a disgusting green color. And as the<br>rain fell, it infected all it contacted with a vile disease, from<br>adventurers (ourselves included) to gypsies to the poor wandering animals.<br><br>It was quickly obvious to us that such evil could only be the work of The<br>Plaguebringer himself, Bertoxxulous! We've known the Bloodsabers to be very<br>active in the Western part of Antonica, and it seemed clear that this was<br>related to their nefarious doings. Even I, as far as I've traveled in my<br>Bardic wanderings, have yet to hear all there is to be told of the<br>Bloodsabers, but it seems ever more inevitable that they will try to summon<br>their dark deity from the very depths of his Plane of Decay.<br><br>But the more immediate concern is for the animals and residents of the<br>Karanas, who are being subjected to this vile disease whenever it rains. The<br>best we adventurers can do for now is to put the poor animals out of their<br>misery and to continue to spread the word about the doings of The<br>Plaguebringer.

Slarti Tal`Krue has some ambitious plans for the Guk zones:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings!<br><br>My name is Slarti Tal`Krue, a Leader of Defenders of Justice on<br>the Rodcet Nife Server. There is a call to all Rodcet Nife <br>guilds to do what has never been done before.  This is no simple <br>raid that is planned.  <br><br>Upper and Lower Guk is begging for a cleansing.  The objectives will<br>be listed, the rules I ask all to read and agree to, and rules will<br>be needed as the scope of this will be on a huge scale.  Once the <br>goals are all met, we will have done what no other has to this point.  <br>I mentioned that before, didn't I?  Ok, first the objectives, then the <br>rules. :)<br><br>Objectives:<br><br>1.  Clear out Upper and Lower Guk completely.<br><br>2.  Make Guk safe for once.  For the two hour goal time, I would like <br>    anyone to be able to go anywhere in Guk without fear of dying! <br>    (non raid people)<br><br>3.  Get some excellent loot from the evil ones!<br><br>Proceedure As Planned:<br><br>We will assemble in Inothule Swamp and setup three waves.  Groups <br>will be formed as balanced as possible, and within the lvl requirements <br>for experience if also possible. Experience will not be a prime <br>goal, but will be high on the list. <br> Once groups are formed, the first wave, aimed at Upper<br>Guk, will secure the zone.  (The rules will explain -secured-)  Once<br>done, the Lower Guk group will zone in and secure Lower Guk.  The <br>third wave, known as 'Guk Patrol' will split. Lower levels for <br>Upper Guk and Higher levels for Lower Guk, and police the random <br>spawns between all camps. It is important we all do not zone in at<br>the same time, to prevent zone crashing and lag over and beyond our<br>means. <br><br>Once this is completed, we hold the zone for two solid hours, reaping<br>the rewards.  <br><br>Rules<br><br>*A note...the rules are extensive due to what we are attempting.  I<br>would like to see Guk run by the players and make it as safe as a <br>friendly city!<br><br>The Breaking of Guk!<br><br>1. Existing camps are not to be taken over wrongly. We follow all  <br>    play nice rules.  Your group WILL be assigned a camp, taken<br>    or not. If camp is taken, the group will make sure the campers<br>    or camper, are / is well protected and will announce camp <br>    protected.  Once the camp opens, then the group takes over <br>    and will announce to the zone that camp is secured.  <br><br>2. Need Before Greed!!  Each camp drops an item of value, minor or<br>   large, and this rule is to benefit all.  Need before greed is<br>   based on your character that you play for the raid.  If an item<br>   drops that you can and will use for your class or race, that <br>   item goes to that person.  If no one can use, then the group<br>   lottos that item till everyone has it.  Intial camps will be<br>   setup according to the classes available.  A group that is Druid<br>   heavy would get Mutant Fungus camp and group that is Paladin <br>   heavy would get Ghoulbane camp, etc.  That was an example.  I <br>   will make sure the proper classes get assigned the proper camps<br>   and based on how many people of each class we get, as balanced<br>   as possible.<br><br>3. Camp Swapping.  Once a camp has dropped items that all has had<br>   looted and everyone has gotten, then they will announce they are <br>   available for camp swapping.  When another camp in that zone has<br>   achieved the same status, then they are swapped during the respawn<br>   time.  This will hopefully ensure variety of loot. With the Guk<br>   Patrol in place, this will not be dangerous to do. <br><br>4. -Securing- a zone.  Once camps are protected or taken, and the Guk<br>   Patrol is established and in place, then we hold the zone for two<br>   hours.  I will issue the zone shout -SECURED- for all to start the <br>   two hour minimum timer.  The event does not need to end after the <br>   two hours is up however, if all Guildleaders there agree for another<br>   hour for rare drops, then we do it.  If we lose too many people to<br>   keep a zone safe after the goal, then the event will be finished <br>   for that zone.  <br><br>5. All campers are to take off anon and roleplay for identification<br>   purposes.  This is to keep confusion down as the Guk Patrol wanders<br>   and you are killing a mob for your group an may appear to be alone<br><br>The GOAL is to make Guk as safe as possible while reaping the items<br>for two hours.  This means, BOTH zones will need to be secured.  <br><br>Secured Guk <br><br>  Mostly, when people go to camps, or find groups, they have to invis<br>to living and invis to undead.  When traveling in some places, you have<br>to stay against one wall or the other.  When you do get to a camp, you <br>have to deal with trains at times.  This raid is intended to END that<br>for two hours.  <br><br>1.  All spawns will be exterminated.  No invising past mobs.  Use invis<br>    as a strategy.  Invis to undead, surround the Froglock Ghouls, then<br>    pounce.  Once spawn is destroyed, heal and med up, and move to the <br>    next spawn, destroy them, etc, until you take your camp.  This is<br>    critical for the third wave (Guk Patrol) to move in and keep it <br>    secured and safe.  <br><br>2.  Please plan on 5 hours for this event/raid.  1.5 hours to setup<br>    groups s people arrive and organize. 1.5 hours to secure Guk. <br>    Two hours goal time to keep the zones cleared and safe.  The sooner<br>    we secure it, the better chances for cool loot. <br><br>3.  High level folks (50+) who prefer to solo are encouraged for<br>    the Lower Guk Patrol! Casters with high lvl pets are highly<br>    encouraged!  We can not have too many people here doing patrol!<br><br>4.  Setup yourself as if this was a Vox raid and lag is a critical <br>    factor. Reduce Clip plane. Turn auctions off.  <br>    /showspelleffects off.  Go to your options and turn<br>    off all damage messages. Turn off OOC.  The shout channel will<br>    be used for Event communication.  This is critical to lower the<br>    amount of people going LD and control lag.  <br><br>5.  Group Leaders will assign a Master Looter.  All items that drop<br>    are Need before Greed as stated above.  Lotto is /random 100.  <br>    There is a code bug.  Group Leaders who see a /random 2 101 will<br>    immediately count that person out of that lotto.  The bug will<br>    automatically select the higher range of numbers after a <br>    normal roll 90% of the time.  I have confirmed this.  /random 2 101<br>    is considered cheating and therefore disqualifies you for that<br>    lotto.  Same rules apply to those in Guk Patrol who are grouped.<br><br>Message to Guild Leaders and their Officers<br><br>  This cannot be done with less than 80 people, not counting those<br>inside Guk the day of the Raid / Event.  If we do not get enough<br>people in the alotted time, it will be postponed till the same day and<br>time in one week.  This is to allow people to plan for it.  <br><br>1. I will need each one of you to email me three days of the week <br>   your guild can do this event / raid.  The most guilds that pick<br>   the same day will decide what day of the week we invade Guk.  Send<br>   to Droberts@Austin.rr.com<br><br>2. There is a reason for this multi-guild event.  If we can establish<br>   that we can come together, unite and achieve this goal, I feel that <br>   a Unified Guild Alliance on Rodcet Nife would be possible.  I would <br>   encourage each guild to take turns doing a similar event we all<br>   can attend. <br><br>3. All Guildleaders will use /anon to be easily identified as a GL<br>   in case issues arise that authority needs to be used.  For people<br>   who do not know, /guildstatus Slarti will tell you which guild I am<br>   leading.  You have to be in the zone, but you do not have to target<br>   the person.<br><br>  Guk Patrol!!<br>  There is a place for you in the Guk Patrol!  Your powers, skills, and<br>  if your class has them, Pet Power, are needed.  <br><br>The job and function of Guk Patrol is critical.  This is to <br>eliminate massive trains that have been known to kill campers.<br>Their safety and ability to destroy the camp for items without<br>the worry of adds will challange your skills.  All classes are<br>needed!  A few wandering Clerics doing random heals and buffs<br>and even an experience rez or two will be highly encouraged.  <br>Be proud of this role.  You will be rescuers, protectors and<br>the person the camp closest to you will depend on in a crisis!<br>You know how guards are everywhere in a city and come together<br>when danger hits?  You get the idea!  <br><br>1. Patrol a given area and stick to it if you can keep it cleared <br>    easily.  There are tons of places where spawns are cocky and<br>    do not feel threatened.  Teach them otherwise and keep that<br>    area safe for others to pass through.  <br><br>2. Guk Patrol will have to understand their role completely.  There<br>    is no such thing as KSing another Guk Patrol.  You see another<br>    clearing the spawns that are not camp spawns, assist them <br>    immediately until all are cleared.  It does not matter if they<br>    are winning or not, kill the blasted critter and if you get the<br>    kill, then loot.  If you find your area heavily patrolled and<br>    you cannot get in a kill edgewise, patrol another area or wander<br>    and protect, that area is secured.  Like any city, the Guards <br>    do not care if they KS one another, they just want it dead, and<br>    they like doing it. Next rule will clarify things even<br>    more when it comes to attacking.<br><br>3. You are not to attack spawns that are being fought in a camp <br>    unless you see a /yell from that group.  If you get the /yell <br>    and you take the kill, do not loot it and let the group's ML<br>    sit out the time it takes to ensure the party their share.  Once<br>    they are out of danger, return to your patrol. <br><br>4. You do not have to group to be in Guk Patrol.  However, if an <br>    area is highly dangerous and requires more than one Guk Patrol<br>    Officer, you can selectively choose to group for communications <br>    and health concerns.   <br><br>5. All Guk Patrol will use /roleplay so you can be easily identified<br>    as Patrol.  If you are not in battle and you see a /yell from <br>    another GP, assist immediately.  If a GP dies, do a zone shout <br>    "Guard Down" for a cleric to be dispatched and have the GP <br>    "repopped".  <br><br>As you can see, if all goes well and all people perform their duties as<br>assigned, then we can make Guk as safe as any city, with enough people.  <br>Once we know we can do it with this zone...then who knows...we may be<br>able to own other places as well. I will give to April 20th for all<br>Guildleaders who wish to join this to send me an email with their Three<br>Best Days of the Week for this event.  By the 21st, they will be <br>replied to for the day that best fits everyone.  I hope to see<br>you all there!  <br><br>Slarti Tal`Krue<br>Defenders of Justice</BLOCKQUOTE>Good luck!

I suspect because there's a grammatically correct apostophe in the word "doesn't".]</i></font> <br><br>It has something to do with the whole fact that bard songs are completely different than spells. I'll poke around and ask some questions on Monday about it. <br><br>And I'll get rid of the apostrophe&#8230; silly thing.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000097.html"><b>Ceremonial Weapons</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I had forgotten to mention this in my original message: Ester stated this would be fixed, that this item was missing database entries for the dly and dmg, but since you're now running on the new format I can't point back to it. <br><br>Then in reference to the fact that "Ceremonial" means it's not meant to be used in melee, you need to make changes to the following items: <br><br>Sarnak Ceremonial Dagger <br>Damage: 6 Delay: 38 <br>Zone: Overthere<br><br><br>Sarnak Ceremonial Sword <br>Damage: 8 Delay: 34 <br>Zone: Overthere <br><br>Garaz <br>50 Warrior VoV Povar]</i></font> <br><br>I don't know what happened with Ester and what was said before.

I do this by putting the items on low level mobs in newbie areas, like West Freeport. Then I'll shout out something like "Hey a rat just stole my money pouch! I had 10 platinum in there! Oh well, finders keepers." <br><br>Then I sit back and watch them go at it. :)<br><br>What I'm getting at is, when this change is implemented, please try and it so we can still give non-quest goods to mobs if we want to. <br><br>Thanks! ]</i></font><br><br>Absolutely one of the concerns we have with this idea.

In a PvP environment, inspection often leads to an attack if you can loot what you inspected. <br><br>In a non-PvP environment, the only britches being shown are the knickers of the inspectee getting in a wad if they complain. Probably it is viewed by most people as the only version of 'personal space' and that is why people often demonstrate upsetness at being inspected. (Personal space being [in western societies] approximately an 18 inch radius cylinder around the surface of your body.) <br><br>BUT, an inspection is really what you say it is: just a mechanism for people to actually know what someone is wearing. People really are being silly when they treat it as something else other than that. I would not even make it a matter of politeness AND it wouldn't matter at all if the game did not offer a message when someone else 'inspects' you. <br><br>Perhaps the game designers could elaborate on why that message exists to put the user community at rest? And if the reason isn't a good one, just take the silly feature out of the game so no one ever knows when someone else is looking at them?? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, the idea to remove the message came up. But it has its uses in the PvP environment. And some people like to know when they are being looked at closely by others (in much the same way that I might squint to get a better look at the logo on your shirt).

If you have shiny armor on or if you're carrying a glowing sword, those people will still beg off you. The fact that they are inspecting you first has very little to do with whether or not they beg. <br><br>They best solution if you are really in need of a respite would be to bag up your fancy stuff before you get to town.

I understand if the technical aspects of reworking this part of the game prohibit the changes, but please don't belittle this.

I understand that there is no way that I can 'convince' you that your emotional reaction is wrong. In fact, I don't believe that your emotional reaction is 'wrong' at all. It's how you feel.

Hence the impasse. <br><br>Neither viewpoint is right or wrong from an emotional stance. So we can't rely on emotional reactions, we have to use logic. And if you look at the strict game mechanics without allowing emotion to become a factor, I think the answer has to be to allow inspection exactly as it stands now. <br><br>I wanted to also touch on the PvP thing.

Seemings that most classes receive sneak or hide at different levels, it would seem a bit more logical to have a success/fail message, starting at the level you can begin advancement (pay Practice Points into the skill). <br><br>In my opinion, this would not be taking anything away from the rogue class nor making an unbalanced game addition. <br><br>The sneak and hide combination is a very fun and useful part of the EverQuest world and I would like to be able to see more character types be able to take advantage of this ability in a more believable (it is a little hard to believe only a rogue knows whether they have hidden or is truly sneaking) format. Thank you for your time. ]</i></font><br><br>The success message is an advantage for the Rogue. The message is not given to other classes with those skills specifically so that it can be an advantage to the rogue. And, actually, it is fairly reasonable. When you're trying to hide behind something it isn't all that easy to tell if you are properly hidden. You may very well have a toe sticking out that you don't know about, or the top of your head may be sticking up (bad hair day, perhaps). <br><br>So, yes, that message is an advantage for the Rogue, and we don't plan to allow other classes to get it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000098.html"><b>Bind Point Location Displayed?</b></a><br>Traves wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I was wondering if there could be a way to find out where your current bind point is (or at least the zone you're bound in). <br><br>I know there is nothing more painful than adventuring in an area thinking you are bound at a certain place only to discover you had forgotten that you were actually bound 10 zones away. This is, perhaps the most frustrating part of EQ for me...especially when playing non-casters who have to beg for binds in the first place. <br><br>I was thinking of either replacing the religion listed onscreen with the bind zone where you are bound or to provide a simple command like /bindzone to give the information.

A rather large update was posted on the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/main/indev.jsp">In Development</a> section today:<UL>04/12/2001<br><br>We're finally starting to get back on a regular biweekly patch schedule. Here are the things we are currently working on that you can expect to see over the next few months:<br><br>Loot rules in the Warrens:</b> We plan to continue modifying the special loot rules in the Warrens. We will be eliminating several ways around the current "Trivial Combat Code" as well as looking at the problem of "spell twinking" in regards to the loot rules. We'll have to see how it goes, and see what people think.<br><br><br><b>Stonebrunt Mountains:</b> The next "free" zone will be the Stonebrunt Mountains, which will be located off the Warrens. It will support a level range roughly equivalent to that in Lake of Ill Omen. We're expecting to release the zone sometime this summer.<br><br><br><b>Dungeon Touchups/Revamps:</b> We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some of the dungeons in the world. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is released.<br><br><br><b>Big Changes Planned for PvP:</b> We've had a number of meetings lately to plan changes to the PvP environments in EverQuest. One of the first things planned for this is to bring up a brand new PvP server with a new rules set on it. This will allow us to test our changes for everybody without throwing any current rules sets out the window. The name of this new server and when it will actually be going up are still to be announced.<br><br><br><b>Continued UI Enhancements:</b> A number of things are planned, from allowing people the ability to buy stacks of items at one time, to improving the way things look on the screen.<br><br><br><b>3D Engine Enhancements:</b> One of the first things up is the enhancement of the engine to support 32bit color with a 24bit z-buffer. This will get rid of the "moving stair step" visual artifact that you see in distant places where surfaces meet at odd angles. For the best explanation of this, look at the blockiness of the river in the Great Divide or the lava river in Skyfire, and finally look at the emblem at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak while moving off at a distance. For those with video cards that support a 24bit z-buffer, appearance will be greatly improved. Update: This is actually now implemented however is not yet bug- free. You can take a look at the new capabilities by setting VideoModeBitsPerPixel=32 in your EQClient.ini. Note: If your card doesn't support 32 bits per pixel, you will probably crash. Also, your Deity Specific Quests: We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific quests that went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and have more in the works.<br><br><br><b>The History Unfolds:</b> Keep an eye on the Harpy's Head Tavern site. As dynamic events take place across all of the servers, more information about the history and the future of the world will be made known.<br><br><br><b>Dragons, Ice Dwarves, and Giants:</b> We're going to continue adding more quests and flavor to these three major Velious factions. Our goal is to continue balancing out the three paths so that the risk vs. reward is balanced for each one. Be on the lookout for new mobs and dialogues popping up in each of these races' territories.<br><br><br><b>New NPC Return Policy:</b> Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a mob and gotten the "Thank You!" message? We are currently working on a way for mobs to return any non quest items back to the player who accidentally gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops.<br><br><br><b>Class Balance Discussions:</b> Some recent changes have been introduced as a result of Absor's now infamous Class Discussions. We're continuing to evaluate each class on an individual basis and will be making changes based on player feedback as we see fit.<br><br><br><b>Velious Magic Resistance:</b> In an effort to further balance the SoV expansion, we're taking another look at the unnaturally high magic resistance of Velious mobs. We'll evaluate this on a zone by zone basis and make changes to better balance out the risk vs. reward in the zones for both melee and caster player characters. <br>We'll fire off more updates as we have information available for release. Until then, enjoy EQ!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

A lot of informative posts were made to the Dev Cornder today by Alan:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000089.html"><b>Inspection</b></a><br>I still have yet to understand why the /inspect on/off was added to the game. This was supposed to keep people from accidently inspecting you when they target you. <br><br>I would of preferred to see the /inspect on/off make it so others cannot inspect me. <br><br>I find it rather annoying having players just run up and inpect me 10-20 times to get my attention or just be an irritant. <br><br>If someone wants to see what I am wearing then they should be polite enough to ask if they may inspect me and at that point I can turn my /inpect on to allow it. <br><br>And yes, when you inspect me... you will see my message about how self concious I am about whether you can see my britches... <br><br>Bolerro<br>18th Season Druid<br>Vazaelle <br><br>Let me go over the philosophy of 'inspection'. The first thing to keep in mind is that nobody is actually inspecting you, at least not in the way that the word would indicate. They are looking at you closely, not turning your clothing inside out to see the labels. <br><br>Inspection does not show your britches. <br><br>What it does show are the things that the game engine doesn't show. If your character is wearing a cloak the only way to know it is to 'inspect' them. The game engine isn't showing what would otherwise be obvious. Inspection only shows the name of an item and it's type (and only that by the icon that shows in inventory). Inspection does not reveal what is in a bag, stats on any item, or what color underwear your character has on. It only shows enough information to allow other players to know what your character would actually look like if the game engine could show every item you are wearing. <br><br>There is nothing invasive about inspecting someone. <br><br>Now if the messages that you receive from the game about someone 'inspecting' you are bothersome, you can turn those off. That would prevent people from using inspection to annoy you. <br><br>I don't disagree with the idea that it is polite to ask someone before you inspect them. But, like many courtesies, it certainly is not necessary. You have the tools you need at your disposal to remove the factor that irritates you about it, should you choose to use them.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000090.html"><b>Bind Sight</b></a><br>Moonshadow wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: About 4 patches ago, "bind sight" was changed in some zones to require line of sight from the caster to the target. There was no announcement of this change, and it considerably reduced the utility of the spell. <br><br>Could we please have an explanation of why this change was made? If it was not intentional, please change the spell back. ]</i></font><br><br>Our 'spell guy', Lawrence Poe, had this to say in response to your question: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This was an unforeseen side effect to a change we made recently. <br><br>The change was made to all spells. Basically we made it so if you are casting a spell be it harmful or beneficial and your target runs out of the spells range, or the casters line of site the spell will not go off and no mana will be used. This was a great enhancement however it had the unforeseen side effect of limiting bind site. There are currently no plans to revert Bind Sight to its former functionality. ]</i></font><br><br>Not much more for me to add. The functionality of the spell has most certainly been reduced. But you can still stay bound to the target for the duration of the spell, even after it leaves your line of site. The check is only made at the time of casting. You just can't use the spell to attach yourself to another NPC from the first to chain yourself out to infinity.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000091.html"><b>Rage of Zomm</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello there, I am a 58 mage on Veeshan and for kicks I decided to try the Rage of Zomm spell for the first time the other day. This pet immediatly suicided once summoned...is this normal? Is this spell being changed or has it been disabled? <br><br>I attempted the summon 4 times and same result as always. I attempted it in Sebilis but I doubt it would be zone restricted. <br><br>Jaytee Bushwacker ]</i></font><br><br>This spell does indeed work. You need to have a target selected and you need to be within normal combat range to that target. The easiest way to get this sort of information is to ask your fellow magicians, as a rule I probably won't be passing on spell casting tips here. I would like to encourage you to talk to players in game to get such information. <br><br>I'm also aware that this spell was mentioned in the class talk threads. I don't have any comment on that aspect of this spell at this time.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000094.html"><b>Frame Rate Drop</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: One of the biggest complain I have from others when I use my AE spell is the Framerate drop it cost on others with slower computer. The Fire Spiral AK is good, although I never get why Fire Spiral would appear as blue wind (blue fire?). But When I toss down the Column of Lighting, or Lightning storm, both have that fire rain effect. Many people in my group starts yelling "Ack, I am so lagged, I can't move around, I can't cast spells." Would it be possible to change these spells so they don't cause many people's computer Frame rate to drop so dramatically? <br><br>Bombus Combus 26th Wiz of Xev ]</i></font><br><br>We wouldn't want to change the spell effects for exactly the reason you noted, they look awesome. But it seems that many people are not aware that you can turn off or reduce those effects if you choose. <br><br>Just click on the 'Options' button (you may have to hit F10 until you're in the 'old' interface mode to do this), then choose 'Display'. There is an option to change you 'Particle Density'. The lower the particle density, the less of a framerate hit you'll take.

I think it's a neat spell effect, and I miss using my lower level bolt spells just to see the animation! <br><br>Also, is there any plans to add a Harvest II to the wizard spell line?

The reason I ask is that I've collected some nice items (Dracnid Thyxl, etc.) that when I find a better item, I can't give the old item away or sell it or anything. Just seems a waste to destroy it. Maybe have a vendor that buys arcane items, and sells nothing? <br><br>Thanks! ]</i></font><br><br>It is possible that we could use the 'bolt' spell effect on future spells, but we don't have any plans to do so at this time. I agree with you on the effect. I have been known to try to time a bolt spell to get it to do very unusual things, like double back on the target or fly off into the distance. I managed once to achieve both goals and had a bolt go past the target, double back just as the creature died and fly right at me! <br><br>There are no plans at this time to add a Harvest II spell. <br><br>As for selling No Drop items&#8230; well, the whole idea of No Drop items is that they can't be passed on or sold for profit. This is done so that people that want such an item will be more inclined to go get it themselves for their own use. Allowing people to sell them, even just to a vendor would defeat that purpose.<br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If the vendor could not resell the item then where is the problem?

If it's not a trivial amount, then we would be breaking the idea of No Drop items. <br><br>I understood that the vendor would not resell it, I figured that went without saying. :)<br><br>No Drop items are No Drop to reduce the desire to gain one for any reason beyond using it yourself.

Alan spoke for a while on the status of the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000087.html">Class Talk Threads</a> in a recent update on the Dev Corner.  Here's the entire post:<UL><i>We have been receiving a fair amount of mail regarding the status of changes to classes based on the items brought up in the class talk threads that I started a while ago. Right now I have little new information for you, but let me spend a moment talking about this.<br><br>The team has read and reviewed the lists that I put together. We've had several informal discussions about them, and a few formal discussions about specific items on those lists.<br><br>So far you've seen a lot of changes based on your input. They have been going into the game as they get finished and tested. Things that didn't require a lot of in-depth investigation on our part, such as changing the Bread Pants for Bards, increasing the drop rates for many Kunark spells, fixing the Track Corpse spell and many others.<br><br>And even some of the more complicated issues have been looked into. Things like giving Druids and Shaman the ability to act as secondary healers, upgrading Mark of Karn (a very complicated spell to balance), the aggro created by debuff spells (and, yes, the aggro created by healing spells), and others that have required a lot of consideration have been added or changed.<br><br>We've also started on some of the much more complicated issues, such as Wizards and their ability to do damage against certain NPCs with the Bane spells.<br><br>To finish the lists we'll have to make the time to have some long and complicated meetings over issues that can't be changed without rather a lot of effect on the game world. We have not had those meeting yet. Recently we decided that we would put PvP issues to the forefront, considering that lack of attention they have had over the life of EverQuest.<br><br>I just wanted to let you know that we haven't forgotten the issues that you brought to our attention.<br><br>Alan</I></UL>

More updates just in from Alan from off of the Developer's Cornder:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000051.html"><b>Mmm...Cake</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Personally, I prefer my cakes made with High Elves baked inside. If not High Elves, then Barbarians will do in a pinch. <br><br>Sinfully Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu <br><br>"Hail! Necromancy, Victorious!" ]</i></font><br><br>Well, hopefully we can reduce the need for you to go to such gruesome extremes. We will be improving the drop rate for brownie parts with the next patch. Other than that we'll probably be waiting for the other food related changes to work their magic before making other changes.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000004.html"><b>More Graphic Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just a note about this. Not sure if it has been noted in other threads (but it should be in this thread). If you are using a Glide capable card (voodoo 4 & 5), by default EQ sets your video driver to the Glide driver. Got back to the first screen of EQ (Where the "Connect" button is), and select options. That will bring up the video driver options you have available for EQ. Make sure that "Primary Display Driver" is selected and not the "Glide" driver. <br><br>Things should work fine after that as long as your video card is capable of the 32 bit mode. <br><br>Regards, <br><br>CJ ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for the tip. Yes, the 32bit option will not work if you're using glide drivers. CJs suggestion is a good one.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000088.html"><b>Panic Animal</b></a><br>Dmiedema wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Not sure which board this is supposed to be posted in, so I posted in both. If it is intentional, I guess it goes here, if not it goes in the bug board. <br><br>The panic animal spell gives no message when it lands. As it works now, the only way to tell if it lands is if it doesn't give a resist message. <br><br>The undead fear spells give a message, the regular fear spells give a message, and every other spell that I have ever used gives a message when it lands, so I'm guessing that this is an oversight and should be corrected. <br><br>This spell has become a very vital soloing tool for rangers since it has been put in, and I can't believe no one else has mentioned it. <br><br>If you guys can't think of anything creative to put in as a message, I would suggest just re-using the regular fear message. <br><br>Oh, and if it is supposed to be this way, an explanation why this spell having no message is the exception to every other spell out there would be nice.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, I have to admit that my first thought was, 'if the animal runs away, then you know the spell worked&#8230;'. <br><br>But for consistency's sake we've added success messages for those spells. You should see them after the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000086.html"><b>Pathing Problems?</b></a><br>Normally we would want you to send your pathing problems to the Quality Assurance &#8211; Testing form, but I wanted to bring special attention to this for a while, and to respond to a comment that we received. First, the comment: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: Pathing at the Ry'gorr camp in Eastern Wastes <br><br>This has been something of a problem since I've hunted there. It can be avoided, but sometime it can be fatal or abused. Let me explain: <br><br>The pathing inside the main house at the Ry'Gorr camp in the Eastern Wastes is horrible! It's almost non-existant. For instance, if you pull anything from inside the house, you have to be careful not to outrun it and keep it in a straight line and lead it out the doorways. The orcs are programmed to run in a straight line towards you, no matter what. <br><br>If you do not lead them out yourself and they get caught in a wall or doorway, they continue to run in place trying to get to you. After about 15 seconds or so, they will "magically" drop from the sky and attack you. Most of the time, they get in a few free hits. I have found that it doesn't matter how much distance you put between you and the orc, whether you are running or standing still, or any other variant makes a difference. They WILL catch you. And these free hits can be fatal if you are a caster, especially if the Chief is along. Even if you survive, these orcs run at Jboot speed and are now in the correct distance to keep smacking you til you die. <br><br>Another problem area is the balcony in the chief/oracle room. If you stand anywhere close to that doorway but don't enter the room, you pretty much can assure yourself that you have aggroed the Chief and his Elites. Again, with the fact that they run in a straight line towards you and you don't see the message that they have aggroed on you, it's a rude awakening to have all 3 of them drop from the sky on you. <br><br>This also works for any orc that happens to spawn on the walls outside the house if you sit in the house. They aggro on you and drop from the ceiling and begin combat. Sometimes they land on the roof and continue to hit you. <br><br>There is only one time where these orcs follow any kind of pathing, and that is when you fear them. Then will run from whatever direction they come from, counter-clockwise around the bonfire room, and out the doorway. They then run outside the walls of the camp and continue up the hill and into the snow. <br><br>Another problem I had was I was fleeing from the Chief. I ran completely outside the camp and up a nearby hill. Being a level 51 necro, I always have DMF cast on me and I proceeded to run off the hill and float over the wall and back into the camp, making a break for the Crystal Caverns orb. Now when I made the wall, the Chief was close behind me but had not caught me yet. I get to the gate and try and open it. Now, this is the only gate in the game that I found hitting the "U" key does not open. In fact, you miss half the time trying to left click that gate to get it open. Can you also check into why you can't hit "U" and open it? Anyway, I finally get the gate open, just barely get inside when the Chief appears and slays me instantly. He managed to get by a wall and a second room wall to get to me in a matter of seconds. <br><br>Now the place where this can be abused is the fact that you can turn the orc tactics against them. This tactic is mostly used by wizards and druids. They run into the house invisible and target themselves an orc. Then they run outside the house and get as far as possible and snare the targetted orc. They can still cast at the orc even though they are outside and the orc is inside. This usually gives them many free hits before the orc appears and hits them. <br><br>So my question is this: Is there a way to fix the pathing in this camp? Possibly give these orcs a set way to run out of the camp and avoid getting snagged running in place? I know it's part of an outdoor zone so the "line of sight" doesn't apply it seems... but perhaps at least giving the orcs a way to stop dropping from the sky would be great. They already run very fast so I don't see where the extra time would hurt. <br><br>Thanks for looking into this if you can! I hope to avoid another 5-death day like I had a few weeks ago due to this pathing. <br><br>--Cy ]</i></font><br><br>First of all, I wanted to thank you for the detailed description. It helps us a lot in these situations when you give us all the details. The only item that you didn't send us that might have been useful would be a few /locs for key problem points. These make it a lot easier for us to find specific areas that need attention. <br><br>The bad news is that there isn't much that we can do to fix this problem. The code that allows the NPC to pop directly to you is needed in the zone to prevent exploits. And it seems that you know how to avoid the problem, it just requires that you be very careful when pulling not to get too far ahead of them. <br><br>Now, on to my request. <br><br>What I would like to ask all of you is this. Reply to this post with places that you've found pathing problems. We can't fix them all, but we want to know about them and fix the ones that we can fix. Like I said, normally we would want you to send such things to the Quality Assurance folks. And after a short while I'll probably just lock this thread and ask you to again send your pathing issues to Quality Assurance. But for now I'm hoping to generate a few more responses on this issue so that we can focus a little effort on it. <br><br><b>Please</b> be specific about the location and NPC names involved. But at the same time please try not to include a lot of extraneous information. We don't really need to know about the whole adventure that you had to get to the pathing problem, just the problem itself. One of our talented designers is going to be reading your messages, and we'd like to use his time as efficiently as possible. <br><br>Keep in mind that some of these problems just can't be fixed due to limitations in the game engine. But we'll fix what we can. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000085.html"><b>Player-baked Food Stat Bonuses</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I read this rumor on the Prexus General Messages boards. Raises interesting questions, if it's not a hoax. The essence of the rumor is that foods made with the Baking skill (didn't see if it was all foods or just some recipes) can now confer stat bonuses. They can also be right-clicked to be eaten immediately, but last half the duration of other foods (i.e. you get hungry again sooner). <br><br>1) Will you eat the food automatically if it's at the top of your inventory? If so, who would ever right-click on it if you could get full-duration effects by always eating baker-made food? <br><br>1a) If you do automatically eat the baker-made food, does that simply mean that consumption rate is doubled? Kind of a poor trade-off for first having to either raise your tradeskill or buy the food (at what will be sure to be inflated prices) from skilled bakers, then have it only last half the time a regular stack of food would? <br><br>1b) Does the food's effect last until you next consume food, or does it wear off sooner? Or does it possibly decline slowly over that period (decreasing the effect as you get "hungrier")? <br><br>2) Do multiple foodstuffs have stacking effects? For instance, could I click on three different foods to eat them all, and get three stacking stat bonuses, or would the second overwrite the first, third overwrite the second, etc.? <br><br>3) Any foods planned to affect not only stat bonuses, but saves as well? Something like Polar Bear Pie (just made that up) which gives +5 SV Cold? Edible Goo gives +2 SV Poison? <br><br>4) When will Brewers be able to make drinks that do something besides get you drunk? I'd like to be able to brew a drink that confers (albeit small) beneficial effects with no negative effects... even it meant that the drinks lasted half as long like baked foods. Brew some Green Tea and get a stamina boost, or Hot Chocolate to get SV Cold... You get the idea. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Feydakin ]</i></font><br><br>There is a patch message on Test server that explains most of this. Let me copy the pertinent part of the patch message: <br><br><i>quote: <br><br>Baking and Food Changes: <br>Now when you right click on a food or drink, it will describe how sustaining that food or drink is. *Note* The message and food values are subject to change over the next week or two as they are being balanced. <br><br>Now you can right click on a food or drink item to consume it just like alcohol. Currently consuming food this way only provides half of the sustaining value of the food. There is also a limit as to how much food and drink you can consume at once. <br><br>Some player prepared foods and drinks now have statistic modifications. These are once again most likely to change during the next week as they are being balanced. </i><br><br>So let me answer your questions to the best of my ability. Keep in mind that all of this is still being tested. It is entirely possible that none of this will go live, or that it will end up working differently when we're done testing. <br><br>1) Yes, you will still consume the topmost food and drink (excluding alcohol) in your inventory. You might prefer to choose to eat a food for a few reasons. Your character might be a glutton. Or, more likely, you might want to gain the benefits that can be gained from eating a certain food type right away rather than waiting for it to be eaten naturally. <br><br>1a) I'm not sure I understand the question, so I'll shotgun some answers. Each food item will have a duration that it feed you. Automatically eating them allows them to last that given duration. Forcing them down your throat will only allow them to last half as long as they would normally. The sustenance duration of player made foods will be set at whatever value seems appropriate. I doubt that all of them will last half as long as store bought foods. In fact, I would imagine that they will in some cases last longer. Remember, not all player made food will have some special bonus to it. <br><br>1b) I don't know how bonuses from food will be treated. I'll know more once we've fiddled with it a bit. <br><br>2) Much like my answer to 1b), I don't really know. We'll let you know more when we've finalized more. <br><br>3) Actually, the only food item that I've heard about so far specifically is the Scorpion Sandwich that was the first one created to test with. It gave (and might still give) a +1 to poison saves. <br><br>4) I don't know the specific plans for brewing. Again, I'll have more details once we've more testing time. <br><br>I'm sorry that I don't have more details on this. It's still early in testing and I don't have a lot of details for you. But I think you'll like the results. I'll get back to you with more information when we're closer to finalizing it all.</UL>

Alan kicked up a few of his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000074.html">thoughts and impressions</a> taken from the recent Fan Faire event in San Diego recently.  Here's the post directly from the Developer's Corner:<UL><i>As a follow up, I wanted to thank everyone that attended the Faire, both players and staff. It seems that everyone had a good time. It's always nice to meet people with similar interests. I went home with a few impressions:<br><br>Players on PvP servers are <b>not</b> mean in person. :) I don't know how it is that I gained, someplace in the back of my mind, the idea that players on a Zek server would be sort of dangerous in person. I'm sorry if I don't remember any names, but I wanted to thank the father-son team that spent so long talking to me and making me laugh.<br><br>Even the old jokes are kinda funny if you're in a room with a lot of other people that can groan at them with you. For a few years now we've been hearing the same camping, spawning and SoW jokes. They actually seemed a little fresher when in a room full of 1,200 people that understood them.<br><br>It does rain in San Diego. I know it's not my fault, but I'm sorry that it decided to rain on us all at the Faire. It doesn't seem fair&#8230;<br><br>I just wanted to let you all know that the Live team had a lot of fun. We talked a bit about it in the meeting today, and it seems that we all had a good time. I wanted to express their thanks to you all for making it so.<br><br>And it was nice to see people cheering for their GMs and praising their Guides. Those folks work hard to help people out, and I was glad to see that you folks were so kind to them, they deserve it.<br><br>But Fan Faire is about the fans. So I was wondering what you all thought about the event. If you have any non-dirty tales to relate, let me know. <br><br>Alan</i></UL>

Here's the round-up of the few updates Alan made to the Developer's Corner today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000082.html"><b>Plane of Mischief Items To Become No-Drop</b></a><br>There is a rather extensive list of items from this plane that will become No Drop with the next patch. I'm not going to list them all, as it's probable that some of these items are unknown to many at this point, and I'm not going to spoil any surprises. <br><br>So if you have any items that originated in the Plane of Mischief that you were thinking about trading, do so before the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000084.html"><b>Sit On & Off</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: A Few changes <br><br>I have only two suggestions. First, since there is a /sit command, why not a /stand command? Currently I have to type /book and then hit "i" to stand up that way. <br>The second was more of a question than a suggestion. I heard rumors a while back about letting the players buy in bulk. That is to say, buy more than one of an item at a time, like full stacks if we wanted to. I don't see why this would be a problem. If it is the fact that maybe we don't have the money for it, then just let it buy as much as we have money for. Am I making sense? Anyway, I would appreciate an e-mail response if it is possible. Thank you. <br><br>Emoth Lasundi of The Guardians of Innoruuk<br>Karan Server ]</i></font><br><br>Well, programmers are an unusual lot. When setting up the /sit function they treated it like any other function that just toggles between two states (in this case, sitting and not sitting) <br><br>The command is /sit on (which can be shortened to /sit) and /sit off (which makes you stand). <br><br>I just use the Stand/Sit button and turn it into a hot key. <br><br>We're still looking into purchasing in bulk. It's not that we don't want to do it, we most certainly do. It's just that it will take a bit of programming and testing to get it working properly. Selecting stacks in more complicated when you're talking about merchant inventory. We'll let you know when we get it done.<br>--<br>Bhalbert wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Ack. sorry to submit twice: <br><br>On the subject of commands: MANY MANY commands can be carried out using ctrl and alt keys. I almost never click on anything with my mouse. <br><br>like ctrl-i (invite and join)<br>ctrl-s (sit and stand)<br>ctrl-b (get out your book)<br>ctrl-r (run/walk) ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for the tips. <br><br>Skeeno wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: By default the keyboard combination of <Ctrl>+S also toggles your character to sit/stand. <br><br>I find it easier to use that and leave a hotkey spot open for a more usuable skill/social. <br><br>Ctrl+B opens the book for casters<br>Ctrl+I invites whomever you have targeted to a group, or accepts an invitation to a group.<br>Ctrl+X toggles teh /camp command to exit the game. <br><br>to name a few others that I find useful. ]</i></font><br><br>I didn't know about the Ctr-X one. Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000083.html"><b>Bard Chains Doesn't Strip SoW</b></a><br>Fendryl wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Selo's Consonant Chain & Largo's Absonant Binding while acting like a snare effect don't strip SoW from creatures. ]</i></font><br><br>This is intentional. In fact, we went to a lot of effort to make it work that way. Snare slows the target down, but when the Snare wears off the target gets all of his movement magic back. We changed this, in part, because players didn't like having NPCs cast Snare on them and destroy their movement spells. NPCs get the same benefit.</UL>

From PlanetEverQuest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Necromancers</a>.  What do you know about them?  You've grouped with them sure, maybe you even are one.  Necromancers are the masters of the dead, reaching beyond the bounds of the grave to magically manipulate their dark minions. With the ability to command an undead being the Necromancer makes an impressive group member but they can also solo most effectively. But how much do you really know about these undead masters of Norrath?<br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the wicked undead masters of the realms.  Running around with skeletons isn't all that necromancers can do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Necromancers of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

Our esteemed Mr. Shadoe has been busy as of late.  Aside from his normal duties as a columnist and author in the EQ community, he's also traveled a good chunk of the country recently.  His latest <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid986865696,81679,">report centers around the Fan Faire event</a> held in San Diego over the weekend.  It is most definitely a read not to miss as this clip will show you:<UL>So, after 750 miles and $1000 later we discovered what was once kosher had suddenly turned into the proverbial Sausage McMuffin with Egg in the face of the Torah. This, friends, is what two years of volunteered time and service amounts to in the guide program. When someone's word is checked, double-checked, relied upon and it still falls through in the end, something is definitely not right. <br><br>Doubly so when you consider the fact that Verant's own Mrs. Butler didn't even have the guts to fight her own battles. Instead of coming out and denying us access face-to-face, she opted to enlist our gracious host, a GM, and an elder guide to do her dirty work as she hid herself behind closed doors. Mrs. Butler effectively quailed away from facing down a 5'6" housewife in the same way a tobacco company quails away from cogent empirical evidence. Such cowardice speaks volumes to this member of the press, and it paints a vivid picture of the way things can often be in the guide program under her majestic rule. But to be fair, what does one expect coming from an employee who just happened to be dating (and later married) a prominent Verant staff member at the time she was hired to fill the position? </UL>As always, a new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=10642205&start=10642205">feedback/response thread</a> has been activated on our General Board.
