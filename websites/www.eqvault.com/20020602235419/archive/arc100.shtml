A very interesting article titled <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/guidebook/kunark/spell.shtml">Descriptive Statistics and the EQ Magic System - Part 1</a> can now be found in our <a href="/guidebook/kunark">Kunark Strategy</a> area.  The purpose of this article is revealed in the opening paragraph:<UL><I>I&#8217;ve read many comparisons of spells on many website and many online forums.  Almost exclusively the power of spells is compared based on the maximum damage they can deliver and the efficiency of mana put into those spells is compared by the ratio: Point of damage per point of mana. <br><br>These are valid measures for comparison.  However, they tell a very limited story in terms of the true power and efficiency of the classes.  My purpose is to offer a more complete view of casting power using different statistics than what I&#8217;ve seen proposed previously.  But first let me start with what seems to be a reasonable argument using the old statistics: </i></UL>Very special thanks goes out to Nenelar Valandur, High Elf Elementalist, of the E&#8217;ci server for writing this for us. <br><br>Enjoy!

I received the following from Banegrivm:<BLOCKQUOTE>It was a day of epic proportions that would be forever remembered for all time by both the armies of the light and the dark. The 1st Fist of Light had gathered at the gates of Qeynos and prepared their descent into the depths of teh catacombs beneath the city where had rested the fate of Norrath in the grips of the Plaguebringers.<br><br>As the army made their way down inside their deepest fears had been wrought to light. The armies of hate had indeed forged a pact with the plaguebringers but Drayvar was not their only commander. Euthan Hatebringer had indeed brought ihs warband the Order of the Crimson Hands in tow. Behind him from the shadows Euthan summoned his ally tis his side. Lasombra, high lord of the dark order Illumin Cathari.<br><br>The army of light stood their ground yet could not possibly survive the onslought of the defending forces. Having retreated back into the surface, Drayvar turned his attention to the now disheveled army of light assured that victory was his.<br><br>Drayvar sent a herald to the Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light and demanded that a battle be set for he had the paladins betrothed and would see her fate sealed in hate, should he refuse to meet him in battle to the end with the loser decommissioning their army. (OOC - duel for deletion of guild and character).<br><br>The two stood before the gates with people from both sides of the army standing fast to the battle. Yet upon that hour Innoruuk was not with his daughters champion. As the paladin that had been Banegrivm drew his blade down to send the shadow knight to his god, Drayvar whispered his final words, "she is one of us, you will never know your peace". With holy rage the paladin took the shadow knights head to place back upon High Keep as witness to all those who cross the threshold of darkness.<br><br>The armies of hate were no more, however now an alliance was set. Where Drayvar had failed stood the human born son of Innoruuk to hold fast the mantle of hate and reforge what was broken. Euthan Hatebringer, High Lord of the Order of the Crimson Hands stood...and evil would surely flow. <br><br>There were tales and legends of heroes, of villains, and strange beasts that walked the lands. This was but a saga or a legacy of things to unfold. Was this the end of the war of Hate as we had known it...or a new beginning? Many questions yet remained unanswered. Only time would tell...but at least for now their was a banner of peace.<br><br>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Two attempts were <br>required, the second attempt succeeded with only one casualty. <br>Those on hand, <br><br>Crush, lvl 57 warrior <br>Magnom, lvl 58 monk <br>Sadre, lvl 58 wizard <br>Solice, lvl 55 cleric <br>Morfeen, lvl 52 cleric <br>Greymalkin, lvl 55 rogue <br>Eaton, lvl 54 warrior <br>Bixen, lvl 56 cleric <br>Boggs, lvl 55 enchanter <br>Vizz, lvl 57 magician <br>Brisban, lvl 55 shaman <br><br><a href="ftp://24.93.173.238:69/nag.txt">ftp://24.93.173.238:69/nag.txt</a> </BLOCKQUOTE>And speaking of Nagafen, here's a crazy email I got today:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hello,<br><br>   Well, everyone said it couldn't be done (an Impossible Mission, as it <br>were), but last night, a level 12 took on Trakanon. Needless to say, it was <br>a short-lived endevour. Previously, the IMF (our M:I team) has attempted to <br>take on Vox and Phinigel also, and both were met with somewhat stunning <br>failure.<br>    With that information present I wouls like to tell you of our greatest <br>mission yet: Veeshan's Peak. We need LOTS of high levels to help us get in <br>there. Now, keep in mind, we aren't a bunch of bumbling newbies, but highly <br>trained at what we do.

Shalkai was kind enough to inform me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings from Aven du Sora on the Innoruuk server! We'll be holding another event this Saturday, June 10th, at 8:30pm PST, in and around Qeynos. This event is the second edition of YAAP (the Young Adventurers Assistance Program). All races are welcome - we will be stationed outside the gates. We'll have food, drink, buffs, and weapons available for free for characters under 10 seasons. Armor for all classes available for free or for easy tasks. Magic items will also be given for simple quests and contests, which we'll customize for participants.  Expect role-playing, races, and anything else that looks fun. Equipment will NOT be "uber-twink"; expect fine steel, banded, raw silk and the like. If you have Crafted Armor or a Flowing Black Robe at 5 seasons, you've already had enough assistance :-).  <br><br>More experienced adventurers are cordially invited too! We'll have a free 6-pack for anyone who wants to imbibe, and you're welcome for storytelling, buffing the youngsters, helping out in your own way, or just having a good time.<br> <br>We hope to see you there!<br> <br>Shalkai Windchaser, Organizer<br>Wyndorn Windchaser, Guildmaster<br>Aven du Sora<br><a href="http://ads.eqhq.com">http://ads.eqhq.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>

Agravaine sends us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, It was an ordinary day on the Test Server in the Oasis of Marr,<br>until I thought someone had trained 3 spectres from the island to the<br>gypsie camp.  After the sprectres spotted me, I made a quick run to the<br>North Ro zone.  But on the way I encountered 3 more spectres at the zone,<br>making 6 spectres total so far.  I found this very odd since the specs<br>that were on the island were still there.  After I rested up and zoned<br>back in, I noticed that everybody was talking about people training<br>specs.  That was not the case.  Spectres were spawing everywhere...on p1,<br>p2, South Ro zone, North Ro zone, gypsie camp... pretty much everywhere. <br>Nobody could quite figure out the reasoning behind this. No strange<br>drops.

The guys at the Electric Playground have kicked up a <a href="http://www.elecplay.com/review.html?article=2572">new review of  Ruins of Kunark</a>.  Also included in the article is some commentary on the current state of the game.  The overall score they give the expansion is an 8.8 rating.  Here's a clip:<UL>The designers of Everquest had the best intentions when creating the world<br>of Norrath. Unfortunately, very few of the gamers who populated this world<br>chose to play in the expected fashion. Verant envisioned players exploring<br>wilderness locales and crawling through dungeons as they quested for power<br>in a classic Dungeons and Dragons style of play. The gamers of Everquest had<br>other ideas and an entirely different style of play. Exploration gave way to<br>finding spots with bottomless experience pools, dungeon crawls resulted in<br>room camping and item farming and the quest for power ground to an annoying<br>and bickering mess of players fighting over the right to sit and kill<br>monsters in a repetitious cycle of boredom.</UL>Thanks Sean!

Here are the latest quotes and excerpts made by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050276-2.html"><b>Warriors Getting Gate?</b></a><br>It's a fake. <br><br>If we were going to put Gate on a non-caster item it would be deep in Veeshan's Peak and drop at a rate of like 5 per year.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050419.html"><b>Gordon Exploting?</b></a><br>Though I really don't care to get involved in this thread, I should probably point out that falls not causing XP loss on the PvP servers isn't a bug. It's part of a ruleset specific change in design to reduce the impact of DOT deaths, bleeding to death, and Pet kills were causing XP loss in PvP combat.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050337.html"><b>What happened to Kunark refunds?</b></a><br>George Scotto (<a href="mailto:gscotto@station.sony.com">gscotto@station.sony.com</a>) is handling issues related to the Kunark shipping problems directly. Feel free to drop him an email. <br><br>I apologize for the problems you've experienced.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050341.html"><b>More Armor Questions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I would much rather be able to wear plate. We all know that it was supposedly the limit of texture memory that caused us not to be able to wear plate. You cripple a nice race/class combo for that reason?]</i> <br><br>That's not the reason at all. They can't wear plate because it chafes their scales. There are still 4 different texture sets for the Iksar just like any other race. The hardiest just isn't considered "plate". <br><br>Of course the hardiest stuff will still be less AC than the plate in the game since Iksar get an innate AC bonus by virtue of having scales.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050370.html"><b>Class Testing</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi - Why we don't think Verant does throrough class testing...]</i> <br><br>What's an issue here is the definition of "thorough". It's simple math, 250K players can find more issues in a given amount of real time than everyone here at Verant, or everyone on the Test Server combined. <br><br>Mistakes happen. I apologize here on the board for them. I take every step possible to reduce the chance of their occuring. They still happen, and will *always* happen. <br><br>EQ is not a linear game where there is a specific and small set of things that a player can do. It's a complex system where thousands upon thousands of people are doing thousands of different things, all at the same time. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050373.html"><b>Harvest</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I think that the recast on harvest is too long, because the small burst of mana every 10 minutes isn't a huge difference. (i love the spell effs btw)]</i> <br><br>Harvest is ok. It is something that you have now that you didn't have before. I realize that everyone wants more, but keep in mind that we have balance issues to consider. The extra mana every 10 minutes easily eliminates on period of meditation per hour. It's fair. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050406.html"><b>Gordon on Kunark</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2) In Norrath proper these mobs will chase you all the way to zone to kill you because they are mad at you.]</i> <br><br>No, they don't. All over, NPCs will not pursue you if you are out of a certain range. Try rooting a fire beetle on the Northeast side of east commons, then run with SoW to the Nro Tunnel. If you get far enough away before the root breaks, it won't pursue. <br><br>The zones being bigger in Kunark do probably exacerbate the problem, since the zones are bigger, and someone is more likely to be able to run a good distance without hitting a zone border. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: In Kunark the mobs won't follow once you get out of spell range, which is very short and very dumb. They should follow you until out of visual range, and maybe even then.]</i> <br><br>Are there specific mobs that only follow you for this short distance? I'd like to get a list of zones and specific critters that have this problem. I asked for it once before, but didn't get much of a response.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050247.html"><b>Melee Classes Getting Robbed?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Non melee classes getting ROBBED, avoiding the PvP switch, ABASHI!!!! Its called Disarm.  So what do casters have to do to make $$, camp, quest, KS!!!, and other undesireable actions.]</i> <br><br>Disarm is not at all reliable enough for this to be effective, so we wouldn't consider it a cheat. Thought I don't have the exact formula handy, I'd be surprised if one in twenty weapon-wielding critters could be disarmed on the first attempt before getting back to the group.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050181.html"><b>Server Listing Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: WHen will the server list go back to server population rather than alphabetical?]</i> <br><br>It's back to being listed by population. New users will see it that way, however since the new program stores preferences, existing people will see it in whatever order they had it set to the last time they entered the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050157.html"><b>Getting Harassed</b></a><br>There is absolutely no tolerance of character gender based harassment. It is handled with the same policies and with the same level of response as every other type of harassment possible. <br><br>If there is something that offends you, please /report it and /petition to let a GM know that a /report has been filed. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050034.html"><b>How do you react to people telling you your job?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Cleric, don't stun just heal. Druid, don't waste mana on thorns just heal. Bard, don't twist, just "play the mana song." Wizards, don't stun, just nuke.]</i> <br><br>Well I've always been of the feeling that a person who built the class up from scratch knows more about the class than someone who hasn't, but I have run across a cleric or two who wanted to be wizards. There's nothing worse than being the first person in the group to call for a heal and being met with an "OOM!". <br><br>Not meaning to take this thread off topic, but this is one of the reasons that it wouldn't make much sense for me to endulge a common request on this board that I "Whip up a level 50 XXXX and see how well you do!". Unless I personally build the class from scratch, or at least get some serious calendar time playing it, I wouldn't exactly be a very good example. I certainly wouldn't even be an average example of the class.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050139.html"><b>Closing Rallos Zek Threads</b></a><br>No, it's not censoring, it's spam control. Deleting the threads would have been censoring. <br><br>Systematically bumping all threads of a specific issue to the front page is spam and is not something that we want to encourage. When this happened a few weeks ago with threads on another issue, I said at that time that we'd close the threads. <br><br>I'm sorry that this was necessary, but artificially elevating the apparent importance in this topic doesn't help your case. It in fact hurts it, because supporters of the issue don't know where to post their followups. For instance, instead of getting 22 people posting in support under one thread, you end up with one person posting in support of 22 different threads. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049576.html"><b>Monks and Stun</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I just read something on a warriors kick being able to stun at a given level? My question, Abashi, is: If a warriors, oh say 15 damage kick, can stun a target...don't you think a monk's 100+ damage kick would knock the target out for a few minutes?]</i> <br><br>It's a good argument Mooo: If a warrior can stun a target with a Kick, and monks kick so much better, then monks should stun. <br><br>However, this is one of those cases where gameplay supercedes realism. For balance reasons, we can't give monks stuns in this manner. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049910.html"><b>Few Armor Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1. You said a long time ago Verant wanted to increase Pally/SK quest armor AC without nerfing rangers. Did anything ever come of this?]</i> <br><br>I don't think that it was this that was said. What I believe that was said (and we're talking like 5 months ago now) was that it wasn't the Paly/SK mid-level quest armor that had AC that was too low, but rather the ranger armor AC that was too high, and that we didn't want to nerf rangers. <br><br>I think it was also said at that point that deciding not to nerf in a particular case did not mean that we'd automatically upgrade everyone else. So by deciding not to nerf ranger armor we weren't saying that we'd up Paly and SK AC. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2. You also said a long time ago you'd look into increasing the crusader spawn (darkforge armor quest). Anything ever become of this?]</i> <br><br>Again 5 months ago, but as I recall we decided against it. Frequently when new items come into existance, there's a rush of people that want them. Since everyone wants them, a shortage *in relation to demand* is present. However, after a period of time goes by, supply and demand even out. <br><br>We try to avoid upping spawn-times or item creation rates based upon info received within a short time after item availability as the data is skewed by the new-item rush.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049962.html"><b>Broken Quests</b></a><br>Thanks for the post Qwinn. I'll send it to the test team. There's a couple that I can comment on now: <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 3) The Cannibalize 2 quest is broken. Dread Diamonds do not seem to be dropping anywhere.]</i> <br><br>It's not broken. It's been confirmed and completed by players. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: There is a quest in the Qeynos bard's guild that involves delivering lute strings to a npc named Fabian. No one's ever seen him.]</i> <br><br>I commented in a Bard thread the other day about this one saying that it was flavor/future expansion. This was apparently incorrect. I read the list wrong, and information on what the deal with this quest is is still pending. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: A special Bardic weapon" mentioned by one of the Bard NPCs in Temple of Sol Ro. May not count as 'broken', but merely unimplemented.]</i> <br><br>This one *is* unimplemented and for future expansion of the storyline. It doesn't count as "broken". <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Blued Two Handed Hammer]</i> <br><br>As I recall, this is one of those rumors that floats around<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049983.html"><b>Naming Bug</b></a><br>We are aware of the problem regarding the names showing for skeleton models as well as a couple of others. It's on the list, and we hope to fix it at some point.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049251.html"><b>PoS Question</b></a><br>I'm not sure what, if anything, will happen with this particular item, but the Plane of Sky items in general are getting a second look, particularly the lower level items. <br><br>I don't think anyone has really gone to the upper levels there. There are still a bunch of things that haven't been found.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/047422-3.html"><b>Will there ever be a non-planar wizard only robe?</b></a> <br>Much like other cases where people are asking for items, quests, etc., of a certain nature, anything is possible but we wouldn't comment on any specific plans of this nature, one way or the other.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048194-2.html"><b>Why is Emerald Jungle so underitemized?</b></a><br>I've asked the test team to look into the loot issues there. It was updated the other day but there's certainly a chance that something didn't get exported. If that's the case, we'll get it fixed ASAP.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049223-4.html"><b>Abusive Players</b></a><br>I'm really sorry that Crystana had to hear the things that she did. We do not at all condone that sort of behavior, language filter or no language filter. <br><br>When this happens you should /report the incident (with it in the chat window, scroll up if you have to), then /petition the issue to let use know that you've filed the report and who you've filed it about. <br><br>The GM will look up the report and give the person a warning just like that and take further action when warranted.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/046941.html"><b>PvP Update</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: What I would like to know, and im sure many others from Tallon, is if players from RZ or VZ are going to be allowed to move to us, are we going to be offered the chance to move to them, thus theoretically moving all the people unhappy with coin loot on Tallon the chance to go to a community where they get to do what they want, and all the people on RZ and VZ get to move to us, hopefully keeping some semblance of balance on the populations .]</i> <br><br>I understand your concerns and agree with most of them. We absolutely dislike the idea of messing with an existing server community in a manner that those in the community would find offensive. In this particular case we're only allowing people unhappy with the current looting arrangements to switch between Vallon and Tallon in an effort to try and make people on both servers happy. <br><br>We basically broke the rule above when we switch Tallon to Coin Only, but we needed try a few things with PvP to try and see what the players there *REALLY* want. As I'm sure you can see from the board here, some things aren't actually representative of the way the population really feels. <br><br>As for Rallos, there are no plans for this server at present. In all likelihood, we'll leave it's loot rules the same, since there isn't a sister server to split people off to. We don't intend to allow people from Rallos to move to Tallon, as the rulesets and the way PvP is handled in code is *very* different. In addition, Rallos went live the same time EQ did, whereas TZ and VZ came up much later, but at the same time as each other. <br><br>We'll be looking at how things turn out after the TZ/VZ/TZ move before making any further decisions.</UL>

I discovered the following announcement made by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><I>Hello Everyone,<br><br>As many noticed in the last patch message, the Gunthak Harpoon (a 15/31 piercer) was made a rentable (meaning permanent) item. As it turns out, this was a big mistake on our part. Basically, one of the guys on the Team received an email about it being NORENT, figured that this was a bug, and fixed the item.<br><br>Even with the item's disadvantages, its stats make it something that should only have been available in the deepest parts of Veeshan's Peak, if at all. <br><br>In the next item patch, it will again be made NORENT, meaning that it will disappear like a summoned item the next time you log off. I do apologize to those who obtained the item in the meantime.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

This means that if the player base were equally divided, at most less then 8% of the player base (over level 7) would have ever even used this skill, let alone understands it. Rogues are one of the least played classes, which makes this percentage even smaller. It is my goal to share with you the workings of Pick Pocket.</i></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Kambic!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Over 45 posts have been made by Verant's Gordon Wrinn over the course of the last 24 hours on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the latest from him:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050006.html"><b>I lost my identity!</b></a><br>These problems seem to run in spurts. <br><br>As I mentioned in another thread today, any time we require human intervention and interpretation of a policy, there are bound to be mistakes. <br><br>In this case, the GM should have made the least significant change possible to correct the violation of the policy. In this case, that would have been just changing the last name. <br><br>I've coordinated with the Head GM on the issue and your first name will be changed back. Please accept our apologies for the incident.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049979.html"><b>Bugged Deaths</b></a><br>There are a couple of issue. Please keep in mind that in order to do a rez for a bug death, the GM or Guide in question has to be able to verify that that is what occured, so something like this wouldn't result in a rez. <br><br>Secondly, this bug itself wouldn't result in a rez even assuming that it was verified. NPCs attack. They attack without warning and provocation. The fact that an NPC somewhere had you on the hatelist, but was too far away to consider chasing you, and was propagating that hatelist to new NPCs that spawned who *were* in range to chace after you, is a design issue that players just have to deal with at the moment. Everything that is happening in this case is *intended*, it just *sucks*. Sometimes things that "suck" are described as bugs, but aren't bugs in sense of something that we can fix readily, or that we would give a rez for. <br><br>For example, NPCs aggroing through walls/ceilings/ and floors in some cases suck. It's not a bug. It's not something that we can fix without breaking a ton of other things. It often becomes a known danger of an area, and therefore a risk that is assumed for fighting there. Yes, as I said it sucks. Death happens. <br><br>In nearly 40 days of playtime that I've put in since August of last year, I died 3 times due to something out of my control. Twice was by disconnections, traced to my ISP, and once was to an honest to god bug, where I was feared by an NPC and promptly fell for 10K. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050005.html"><b>Hunting Solo Spawns</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: What incentive is there not to hunt solo spawns?]</i> <br><br>There's no problem with "hunting" solo spawns. Camping the same spot, killing the same NPC over and over again, because it's faster than doing anything else, and provides little to no risk, is the problem. <br><br>Solo stationary fast-spawns provide a really high reward for little risk. That is the core problem that we were addressing.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049848.html"><b>Overcrowding</b></a><br>If a server had 2200 people on it at peak before Kunark launched, and has 2200 people on at peak after Kunark lauched, then the crowding situation has to be improved, even though the number of people on at peak is still a bit high. <br><br>The expectation of course is that people have to spread out to the new zones. If that isn't happening, we need to come up with ways to encourage people to move into them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049885.html"><b>I was suspended for a "bad trade."</b></a><br>Giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, I'm happy to investigate issues like this, but I need the proper information. If you have the "ample proof" that you suggest, please email it to me at <a href=mailto:gwrinn@verant.com>gwrinn@verant.com</a>. Please also doublecheck the GMs name. We don't have a GM using that alias. We had a Guide a while back that had a name very close to that, but he resigned a few months ago.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049895.html"><b>Why is the loot in Kurn's Tower non-existant?</b></a><br>Thank you for posting your observations. I'll forward them to the Live team and see if we can get them to check it out. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049846.html"><b>Why do I get hit by mobs attacking my pet a half zone away? </b></a><br>Hrm. I thought that this bug was corrected several months back. I had a situation where I was fighting Ice Giants with a friend. He rooted the giant, but somehow got too close and got killed. The giant, from half-way across the zone was able to hit me. I was lucky enough to be able to dive off of a cliff with about 10 hitpoints left to avoid XP loss. <br><br>If anyone can come up with a way to reproduce the NPCs hitting you from halfway across an outdoor zone, our testing team would love to hear about it at <a href=mailto:eqtesting@verant.com>eqtesting@verant.com</a><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049733.html"><b>Why aren't there natural disastors in Kunark as you promised?</b></a><br>You're talking about earthquakes and manastorms and such? <br><br>Some marketing guys read the design doc for Kunark and took some of the things in there a little too literally. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049744.html"><b>Ninja Looting</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Ninja Looting? Will Verant stop this madness. Pictures and links of what went on!!!!]</i> <br><br>Please, give us some credit. We do everything possible to stop this sort of antisocial behavior. We put in loot messages so people would know it is happening, and we put in a policy making it illegal. We get involved with it and try to take care of the issue as much as we can. <br><br>That said, though we try, we can't be everywhere at once. If we can't respond to your particular case right away, unique names on the servers give you some recourse. Please note also that we won't dupe an item to fix a situation. Until the item can be removed from the person who did it, it's out of play. <br><br>The point I am making is that yes, we do everything within our power to keep people from using dishonest and illegal tactics to disrupt the enjoyment of the game for others, but the responsibility for it happening lies with the person committing the act.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049769.html"><b>A Gunthak Harpoon Discussion</b></a><br>You definitely have a point. I know that one of the guys had heard several complaints about it being NORENT. It's possible that he just took the initiative and "fixed" the item. If we did make a big mistake making it rentable, we'll probably have to correct it. <br><br>The stats that I'm hearing, espicially the high DMG rating, sound in excess of what should be available with the amount of work you are describing. <br><br>I'll check into it tomorrow, and thanks for the info.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049719.html"><b>Abashi Note Evil, Making Game Decisions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: ABASHI, I know you are not an EVIL person . . . .]</i> <br><br>Thanks for the benefit of the doubt :) <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: But wouldn't it make sense to open a dialog with your customers? Can't we discuss this ranger issue more concretely? Can't we somehow resolve this to our mutual satisfaction?]</i> <br><br>Two issues, <br><br>Firstly, though I realize that not everyone here on the board for the initial discussion is present now, there was a good deal of dialog about the issue when it first came out. The posts lately are basically bringing up the same arguments that have already been covered. At some point when there is a disagreement that isn't resolvable, one party needs to terminate the debate lest it goes on forever. I don't like the idea of saying "No" to every ranger post that pops up since that just upsets people and drives them on even more. So "ignoring" (meaning: not posting in reponse to them) them, or rather, focusing on other issues, becomes the best course of action <br><br>Secondly, where before we (meaning the tuning team) were absolutely firm on the issue, we're less certain now and are further debating the matter internally. It's not exactly appropriate for me to come out and establish or further a stance, whether it crushes or builds up hopes, unless we're agreed on the subject internally. <br><br>We've reviewed all of the issues presented. Though I do have faith that the issues can be presented in a number of different ways, all the facts are in. When we're again agreed internally, regardless the outcome, I'll be sure to let everyone know if anything changes. Please however don't let what I've said here turn into daily posts asking for an ETA for a decision. We need time to insure that whatever we end up deciding, is well-grounded, and not a kneejerk reaction.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049514.html"><b>Verant Vs. The Complainers</b></a><br>Thanks for the kind words thecrow00. <br><br>And it is true that everyone has their own set of issues that they feel needs to be addressed in some fashion or another. We'd actually be worried if we had a game as complex as this, and no one complained about anything. It would mean that either people just didn't care, or that they all had left. Neither situation would be good for us in the long run.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049528.html"><b>Soloing</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I would just like to make an irrefutable statement. Players will not get bored with the game because they are able to solo at any level, to some extent]</i> <br><br>I was with you up to this point. I disagree. If everyone is able to solo at every level, even "to some extent", then groups (which is what we want to encourage) would just run over encounters in the game. We provide classes designed to be able to solo. They are certainly limited in terms of where they can go, what they can do, and what they can acquire. <br><br>If the ability to solo is so important to someone that they always want it to be available, they should consider finding a class that has that capability. Of course, the downside of doing that is that you are often less desirable to the group. <br><br>Solo classes have to be jacks of all trades. They typically end up not doing things as well as group-oriented classes can. This has worked out quite nicely.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049492.html"><b>Tracking Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I seem to recall at one point you saying that Tracking was not working exactly as intended and that you were looking for suggestions to fix it?]</i> <br><br>Actually we said that it works appropriately and that we've no short term plans to enhance it. We'd like to improve it sometime, like other things in the game, they just can't all be on the docket at once. <br><br>Our focus now is creating new and enticing content that can keep people busy and entertained for a good deal of time, rather than just making everyone more efficient fighters.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049400-2.html"><b>Forgetting to Hand in Newbie Note</b></a><br>Those quests are linked and are one-chance deals to give something special to the Iksar that protects and safeguards his birthright throughout his life. <br><br>They are created with that in mind. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049388.html"><b>Super Mobs: Running, Casting, Melee'ing</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Mobs are intentionally made more powerful in the game because Verant assumes its players are more intelligent than their AI routines.]</i> <br><br>That's the deal. We also want to make the game suitable for groups, which requires some pretty nasty critters. <br><br>NPCs get other bonuses like never fizzling, and get to take advantage of some pretty spiffy regen rates. Even with all of their advantages, people still manage to kill them and advance (wouldn't be much of a game if you couldn't:). Of course, death is also part of the game, and it wouldn't be much of a game if it wasn't. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049154.html"><b>Quests & Events</b></a><br>First, let's sort out some definitions. <br><br>A Dynamic Quest is something that is run solely by the GM staff and not assembled specifically at players request. They range from something as simple as a minor invasion of an area (NPCs run in and kill everyone until a force comes to stop them.), or historical epics important for the storyline in the game (often run for weeks with individual phases or chapters that run for a few hours). The latter often contains a good deal of RP content, and is run across all servers. <br><br>Events, on the other hand, are typically player-initiated and organized affairs. Most of these can be done without GM assistance. Some of them, and I've seen some pretty complicated and intriguing events, require GM assistance in one form or another. <br><br>For "Events", we'll have an email address available soon, along with guidelines for requesting assistance to pull these off. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049152.html"><b>Cannibilize 2 Quest Broken?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Uh..It's been weeks since this quest went live..with 50,000 people NO ONE has found the diamonds yet. I believe they arent in the game. Could you do us a favor abashi and check it out yourself?]</i> <br><br>I just saw in another thread that someone found them and completed the quest. That thread contained a spoiler so I won't link it here, but it's evidently working. The dev team was right on this one, we'll get them next time :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049041.html"><b>Testing Bards</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well, it turns out that the test of flight is an archery contest. It looks fun, but as a bard, I cannot compete, because, despite the discovery of a bard usable bow]</i> <br><br>That bow being usable by bards was a mistake that was corrected a few patches ago. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: So basically, I found out that there is an event for every single class, except for bards.]</i> <br><br>Well, bards have always been pretty much in their own category, making something like this a bit difficult. Every melee capable class can out-melee them, and their songs aren't really appropriate to put up versus spells. Bards are probably the best example of a class that is balanced by usefulness to the group as a primary concern, with offensive power being further down the list. <br><br>If anyone has any ideas how some type of test for bards could be laid out, feel free to post your ideas here. I'll be happy to forward them to the Event Master.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049930-2.html"><b>Naming Incident</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well, I had my first experience with the naming commandos recently. It appears a Guide on my server just happened to be a history major, as he told me my name, Temujin, was spelled so closely to Ghengis Khan's birth name (Temojin, or some such) as to violate policy.]</i> <br><br>Like any situation that requires human judgement, there will be cases where mistakes are made and where the goals of the underlying policy are not met. That's what happened here. <br><br>The spirit of the name policy, particularly the section about names of historical significance and from popular media, is to judge names based upon knowledge that an average and reasonable person would have. This covers the ever-so-popular names like Gandalf and Merlin. <br><br>In your case, the change was definitely unjust, and I've coordinated with the Head GM to restore your chosen name. We sincerely apologize for the incident.</UL>

ForestUnder sends us the following wacky announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Nagafen's Lair Newbie Rush-Xegony<br><br>Hail Norrathians, tired of sitting on yer butts<br>waiting for that ghoul or goblin to grow from a lil'<br>tike to something worth killing? Got a character that<br>you created after getting a little too close to some<br>strange looking mushrooms and want to hide the<br>body?Well then either load up that character or find<br>an empty character slot and start up a level 1 dark<br>elf (preferably warrior with all his points into<br>stamina)and join the suicidal contingent at the<br>entrance to the Lavastorm mountains and try and see<br>the great big red oaf, Nagafen, himself.<br><br>OOC: This is going to be held around 9:00 central on<br>Friday, June 9. I'm planning this event as a fun way<br>to end one of my accounts that I'm cancelling and<br>would like as many people as can participate to. I<br>will be there with my lvl 22 druid accompanying the<br>rush. Any people who have druids or shamans on the<br>Xegony server but don't feel suicidal can just come to<br>the Lavastorm side of the Nektulos-Lavastorm zone and<br>cast SoW on all the rushers. Anybody who wants to come<br>is welcome to either start new lvl 1 dark elfs or use<br>old characters on Xegony that they don't care about.<br>We will meet at the Lavastorm side of the<br>Nektulos-Lavastorm zone and the participants using<br>characters other than lvl 1 dark elfs will have to<br>arrange their own transportation. For obvious reasons,<br>do NOT use characters with anything you care about<br>losing on them. After the rush depending on the<br>enthusiasm and number of people we get we may all<br>create lvl 1 barbarians and rush Vox or have some sort<br>of party.

I received the following from Banegrivm:<BLOCKQUOTE>It all started on a cold day when the lightning pierced a murky sky and<br>the cold bitter winds blew through Norrath, a dark forbodeing of things<br>to come. All seemed well when the army that had valiantly defended high<br>keep had returned and sailed their crest upon a banner once more; the<br>1st Fist of Light returned. But then within the bowels of Neriak came a<br>stir amongst the Teir Dal. They had not forgotten their past, nor their<br>plans, and especially their defeat. There must be retribution! The "Fist of Hate" is born?<br><br>With the appearance of that dark standard came Drayvar, whereabouts<br>still unknown. Then appeared Mordeki, a ruthless shadow knight who<br>carried orders supposedly from the hand of Lanys, daughter of Innoruuk.<br>Mordeki poisoned a high priest in the process of collecting these orders<br><br>only hand them to Drayvar personaly. These orders commenced and<br>officiated in the new Hate army that was to crusade through Norrath in a retributive strike to eliminate the light army.<br><br>Then somewhere along the lines is believed Euthan (Banegrivm's brother)<br>and Martyr (who is now reportedly Euthans brother also) have also allied with the new hate army as well.<br><br>Then a letter arrives from Qeynos written by Chesgard, a Knight of<br>Thunder. A greta veil of shadow has begun to fall across the city of<br>Qeynos. Crops wither, fish found floating dead at sea, the graves of the<br><br>dead found torn open as a sore against the land, and strange sounds<br>began to fill the hills at night accompanied by the baying of wolves<br>beneath a witches moon. Rumors abound that the undying one had even<br>returned to the disheveled ruins nearby. Chesgard worried for the life<br>of his son, but was afraid to act for rumors and stories had been spread<br><br>as old wives tales about their good commander Kane, speaking of witchery<br><br>and demon worship.<br><br>After counseling with the the High Priestess of Rodcet Nife, within the<br>temple of life...she too concured with the knight that a great evil was<br>laying its grip fast about the city and if something was not done, then<br>the end would come...and darkness would reign supreme over the vassal.<br><br>Chesgard feared for the life of his son who patrolled the hills. He<br>could not bare the thought of losing him. This in mind the knight set<br>out upon the road and entered into the Rathe mountains. Here he entered<br>a valley enshrouded by a thick heavy fog, wherein he found a small band<br>of gypsies. He spoke to an old crone that saw in her visions the<br>darkness which that knight spoke upon.<br><br>She told him if he sought its source she needed to find the mariner who<br>had traveled the world over. Only then would the source of the evil that<br><br>plagued the good people of Qeynos be known. Her last words to Chesgard<br>as he departed were "the blood is on the walls." Later Chesgard<br>discovers from a local youth about a captain whose ship is in dry doc at<br><br>port and comes to believe this may in fact be the same "mariner" that<br>the old crone spoke of.<br><br>Chesgard then set quil to parchment and sent a page with the letter to<br>the Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light. The page then was seen in<br>the hallways leaving "changing" from the visage of a young lad, to that<br>of a fair and beautiful high elf from whose lips could be heard, "soon<br>we will be together my love."<br><br>In the letter Chesgard also had become suspicious as to the dark<br>tidings, considering the re-emergence of the hate armies. The last time<br>such evils were soon were none other then the war of hate, around the<br>time of the battle of high keep. This was when the dead raised from<br>their graves in the hills and Varsoons decayed plague was wrought across the lands.<br><br>During this time Drayvar managed to temporarily ensnare the soul of<br>Hothrog, with the aid of the witch Najena. Zyac later used his rites to<br>unbind the soul of Hothrog from being bound in a Necromantic rite of<br>passage. During this time a few confrontations occured between Fist of<br>Hate and 1st Fist of Light, this only being one of them...not even<br>counting the endless taunting from the ranks of the Hate army.<br><br>Having the letter a scouting party sets out to Qeynos. Its believed by<br>Aikek and Linien that the "mariner" is none other then Captain Rohand<br>form the Mermaids Lure at the docs. This same Captain also speaks of<br>tales regarding the vampire Mayong Mistmoore not as a Teir Dal, but as a fallen high elf.<br><br>The party which then consisted of Banegrivm, Linien, Genieve, Hothrog,<br>Shaym, Mystican, Jarkari, and Raleldor Jax; a passing warrior who had<br>heard the tales of Qeynos's strife and offered his sword in the cause.<br>They maid their way the docs and found the Mermaids Lure and spoke with<br>the captain. In the midst of their conversation with Captain Rohand, a<br>gypsy spoke to Banegrivm and said "only he who is of open faith may<br>pass, what god do you follow?"<br><br>When Banegrivm answered the gypsy he was informed to "hail mister<br>bloodheart" deep within the catacombs. Shaym new immediately considering<br><br>her former past "who" exactly mister bloodheart was. He was none other<br>then the Lord of the Bloodsabres themselves, vile champions of<br>Bertoxxulous.<br><br>The scout group made their way into the sewers. After much searching<br>they discovered a secret door which led entry to the home of what was<br>thought to be just a temple of Bertoxxulous. As they entered the<br>ante-chamber a foul wind blew and what sounded like howling demons<br>filled the air.<br><br>As they entered in they saw twin shadow knights which guarded and entry.<br><br>Raleldor was able to pass deeper within, being a warrior without liege<br>to any faith. As he entered he saw not but a temple...but an entire<br>citadel of deep dank evil. He made his way to S'ragg Bloodheart and as<br>he hailed him...a shrill vile sound pierced the air as a demons tendril like wisps took the life of Hothrog within an instant.<br><br>Banegrivm gave the command for immediate retreat knowing there was know<br>hope of a frontal assault. They reformed and pulled back with the<br>knowledge that they had and an idea of the perils that lay ahead of<br>them. But now new questions remain. What do the followers of<br>Bertoxxulous have to do with those of Hate?<br><br>Later that same fatefull eve...Raleldor and Banegrivm discovered a<br>paladin of Mithaniel Marr amidst the ranks of of the Qeynos guards. This<br>struck odd considering as soon as he appeared he dissappeared and then<br>was found outside the Mermaids Lure. Even stranger is the fact that it<br>had been thought all the guards true to the Qeynos seal were followers<br>of Rodcet Nife. As the two spoke with Lieutenant Arathur, they were told<br>by him to seek out "Rolius" in the Hall of Truth. When the two traveled<br>there they were told by this knight to collect militia helms from the<br>fallen corrupt city guardsmen.<br><br>How odd a wayward knight of truth finds himself in Qeynos spreading the<br>word of Marr. How odd yet again a paladin who follows Marr is fated to<br>battle the arch enemy of the temple of life. But again...why? And how<br>does all this relate to the the rising hate armies. What will happen<br>next? Only time will tell...for assuredly war is coming...<br><br>OOC - all of this is the background storyline that will be leading to mass <br>guild conflict. Please contact <a href=mailto:banegrivm@aol.com>banegrivm@aol.com</a> for interest in the light <br>side armies or contact <a href=mailto:zyacdvarr@aol.com>zyacdvarr@aol.com</a> for joining the hate side armies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
