Gordon got an early start on the Gameplay Board today with the following posts he generated:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009890.html"><b>Shadow Knights Dead?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When asked what spells are useful to a group a SK can cast the response has Been NONE or one<br>Darkness??? maybe<br><br>On a poll at: <br><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/</a><br>SK&#8217;s are DEAD last!!!!]</i></font> <br><br>EverQuest has 14 classes. *Someone* had to be last. Being last here is not really indicative of any problem. Besides, the difference between SKs and some of the other bottom classes is really not that great. For instance, someone could say "SKs are preferred over monks in groups 47% of the time", and suddenly it wouldn't sound as bad. <br><br>But that poll did not ask who you want in your group, it asked what is the *FIRST* class you look for when forming a group. There's a tremendous difference between those two questions. Of course regardless of what question you ask that has people rank a list, there will still always be someone in the list who is last. <br><br>I think that SKs need to start doing what I sugggested rogues do a few months ago: Show people what you can do, educate them in the ways of an sk, but most importantly, be cool with people. Your personality and reputation has far more to do with what groups you get into than your class. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009933.html"><b>Mez Stacking</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Mez stacking is broken. Every other spell line works this way. Better spells overwrite the weaker ones.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry that you don't agree, but as I said before, mez spell stacking works as intended. NPCs only know if they are mez'd or not, and the spell effect is absolute regardless of the duration of the spell. I've spread the word around that this is indeed not a bug, so you shouldn't get conflicting information going forward.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009938.html"><b>Velicous Creatures</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: PLEASE tell me its not a rehash of exsisting MOBS / Monsters with pretty new colors.]</i></font> <br><br>There will of course be some new variaties of existing creatures, as there is in Kunark, but there will also be a bunch of new ones as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: P.S. Will this new graphics engine revamp ALL of Everquest or just the new areas in SoV]</i></font> <br><br>As with Kunark, the new areas will adopt newer and more advanced technology. "EverQuest Proper", however, has to remain as it was in the original release.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009940.html"><b>Dragons</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are we told that the three dragons for the high level are now rare spawns? Why are we facing more hardship the higher the lvls we get? I really think that this change is rediculous and should have been annouced before you waisted alot of people time.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm afraid that I don't understand your complaint. NPC spawn rates/times etc., are never broadcast to the players. Secondly, I'm not sure what you mean by "waisted a lot of people's time". If you mean that people were waiting in the zone when the servers came up to get the dragons, and they weren't there, that doesn't really equate to much lost time at all. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009953.html"><b>Mana Battery</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon, about this quote:<br><br>"I'm sorry, but we've ruled out creating "mana batteries". The greatest extent that we can implement a mana battery is done with..." <br><br>Why, then, do you continue to leave bards broken, serving nothing more than this purpose? Its what we've been complaining about for ages.]</i></font> <br><br>I don't understand what you are getting at here, if you could elaborate. The subject of allowing enchanters to create mana batteries, and the existing modulation rod and the necromancer "conversion" line are not, in my opinion, related to bards. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009963.html"><b>What would you do if you caught someone cheating?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The GM could not verify that this item was in the players posession and gave that player the benefit of doubt and reimbursed the item. I was immediately told this occurance by the player. They bragged how they got over on the gm.]</i></font> <br><br>We'd certainly appreciate you /reporting such things if witnessed. Our new customer service policies regarding reimbursement is based on our ability to determine things from the logs, but you are correct that we will give the benefit of the doubt lacking any concrete evidence to the contrary. <br><br>However, if this is abused everyone is aware of the impact upon the game it will have, which is why we ban any scammers immediately.</UL>

Yakatizma hit the new <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Coalition+of+Tradesfolk&number=8">Coalition of Tradesfolk Board</a> recently and has made several posts to date:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000076.html"><b>Recipes</b></a><br>The recipes themselves are indeed the simplest part of the process. It is the many factors that play into balance and any extra coding that needs to be done that is the most time consuming. Once the properties, economic values, availability and difficulty of the product and its components plus the impact of the final product on existing items are determined the recipe table can be produced and placed for testing. This is why some content with very low balancing issues can be implemented quickly and others, blacksmithing for example, with high balance issues are very time consuming. For instance, the silk thread, bandages, small bag, and silk cord, all of which had extremely minimal balance issues were placed on test server the same day I saw them on the wishlist, but of course for them to appear on the live servers they must go through testing and wait for an available patch.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000066.html"><b>Chemistry</b></a><br>There is one other class that dabbles in a chemistry of sorts that can mix dyes besides Shaman.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000047.html"><b>Trade Skill Messages</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Implement a new message for tradeskills with the same display range as /say.<br>For example, if successful: "A sparkle of light gleams from Laestir's jewelry kit."<br>Alternately, if unsuccessful: "Laestir empties his jewelry kit of ruined materials."]</i></font><br><br>This is a very desirable feature in my opinion. I will attempt to have it addressed at the next tuning meeting.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000036.html"><b>Fletching</b></a><br>I'll come up with an arrow recipe that uses ****atrice beaks but the benefit of the arrow will have to be in its damage/delay ratio and its magic/non magic flag. Unfortunately the current engine does not allow for missiles to have procs. Another problem would be the fact that items with spell effects can not be made stackable, making storage and reloading of missiles with effects difficult.<br>--<br>If there are other items that you feel would make sense as fletching components in addition to the c-ockatrice beak I would like to see a list of them posted.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000014.html"><b>Tailoring</b></a><br>Thank you for the feedback. I have changed the icon for silk threads to the "urticating hairs" graphic, changed the weight of Silk Bandages to 0.2 and removed the skill check from creating Silk Thread.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000105.html"><b>Enchanters</b></a><br>Fear not enchanters. The summon mana series of spells has been expanded for use in enchanted trade skill items and you may find that enchanted precious metals have uses outside of jewelry craft. It is true that some items with special properties may need a cleric or shaman in addition to an enchanter, and in the case of some cultural items from societies without casters may exclude the enchanter entirely. However, the magic items produced with the assistance of a Cleric or Shaman are very noticeably different than those produced with solely enchanters. Enchanters will remain true to their namesake as masters of enchantments.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000013.html"><b>Tinkering</b></a><br>For tinkering to produce the mechanical wonders and blunders that gnomes are famous for it must be fairly heavily reliant on products of other trade skills as well as odds and ends found by the gnome as he adventures. The plus side of the dependency on other trade skills and treasure drops is that the difficulty to create a tinkered item will allow for more beneficial and/or powerful end products. Once the blacksmithing goes live I will be continuing to add content to the trade skills, including tinkering as I work on Velious. If any of you tinkers have good ideas that you would like to see implemented for the trade skill please post them on this board, ideally with the prefix Wish :(  title of post)there were some good suggestions for several trade skills on the wishlist board and now that this board is back up hopefully there will be many more.</UL>On a sidenote, you may have noticed I have started putting two spaces inbetween posts on the infobits.  If you like it double-spaced or single-spaced please leave a comment indicating it.

Gordon made a few more posts late last night on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009744.html"><b>Positive GM Experience</b></a><br>Thanks for posting! :)<br><br>As a note, we are currently working on implementing a version of the GMRes that isn't subject to the time restriction and doesn't apply resurrection effects.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009575.html"><b>CS Help Needed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Our records indicate that your Station Member account was cancelled at your request.

We've hired a number of new tech-support and customer-service representatives, it's likely that one of them had a problem with the phone system. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So I try that -- Am I surprised when I get the same message trying to log in? NO! But guess what? I have to CALL BACK. Yes, another test of paitence. So I figure lets email, its easier and easier to get a response. Well, amazed.

The following report was sent in by Ganzon:<BLOCKQUOTE>This occured at 8/29/00, around 2AM EST. <br><br>-GM Event on Povar-<br><br>While hunting Sand Giants in Oasis, I came across two <br>named Sand Giants standing near the orc highway. They didn't attack onsight, <br>and just stood there for a few minutes. Reports that other named Sand Giants <br>appeared at the docks were confirmed, and after a moment Harziz Garnt, a <br>midget Sand Giant (about the size of a human) began to kill at the docks. <br><br>He had  a partner who was about the size of a gnome casting wizard spells. <br>Reports of his brethren on a killing spree at the Orc Highway were also <br>confirmed, and that was when we got smart and decided to retreat to the first <br>pillar at the water to regroup. The Giants were killing off everyone, <br>disregarding race and religion...they had to be stopped. We formed assault <br>groups and hunted down Harziz Garnt, who, when attacked, called for his <br>gnome-sized friend to cast a devestating area of effect-rain spell in the <br>dead center of our mass of about 30 people. My party dove out of the assault <br>group in time to avoid being hit by the second and third rains, but most were <br>not that lucky. <br><br>We regrouped again at the first pillar and buffed up while <br>the Giants were enjoying themselves by killing weaker people. After everyone <br>was at full mana and full health, we went after Harziz again who had taken <br>the gypsies hostage with his gnome-sized friend. We pulled him away from the <br>gypsies and proceeded to beat him down, Fearing his friend so that we <br>wouldn't be hit with anymore devestating area spells. After a few minutes of <br>nuking and melee, we got him on the run, and eventually killed him. We had <br>very little time to celebrate because the other assault group was being <br>wrecked by the gnome Giant. He went down fairly easy though, once we got <br>enough melee people in there to interrupt his castings. The third giant to <br>die was one of the large ones, Nirziz Pire, who ran faster than a Shaman with <br>Spirit of Cheetah. <br><br>I myself didn't get to see the fourth one go down, or even <br>if he did, but I remember hearing his shout about how we "won the sands this <br>day." <br><br>/OOC As far as I know no one was able to loot anything, and none of the <br>Giants were part of a GM quest. This was all a big fun thing, and no one lost <br>exp for dying at the hands of the Giants.  <br><br>Ganzon Actueras,<br>35th Shaman of The Sentinals.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you.

Gordon Wrinn, aka Abashi (aka Top Secret Goverment Message Board Posting Machine), let loose another round of board posts on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop: <UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009659.html"><b>Thicken Mana Line</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why not make the mana vials expendable items that recover a certain amount of mana when consumed? The higher up the mana vial spell is, the more mana is regained by drinking the vial. You can keep down the abuse of this item by making it so they cannot be placed in any containers. That and the high level ones will be VERY expensive to make (4 rubies for the highest level mana vial).]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry, but we've ruled out creating "mana batteries". The greatest extent that we can implement a mana battery is done with the modulation rod (which eats hitpoints and is lore) and with your friendly neighborhood necromancer.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009672.html"><b>Smokers Getting Damaged While Taking Breaks</b></a><br>You could just turn your autoattack function on and back up against a zone wall. Anything coming after you would then most likely be in front of you, be auto-targeted, and attacked when it approached. The best suggestion I can offer is of course that you camp to take your breaks. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009656.html"><b>Disillusioned Enchanters</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are enchanters not given the ability to cast these very same race/creature illusions upon either the group as a whole, or individuals in a group? (You already HAVE the code for specific-case faction issues with the already in- game illusion series of spells)]</i></font> <br><br>I agree that the code exists, is in game, and would be easy to do. Our reasons for not implementing illusions on others via enchanters is that its not what we had in mind for them. It's part of the premise for the enchanter class. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Are you explicitly saying that in order for an enchanter to cast any illusion spell on themselves/others that a faction adjustment MUST take place and that for this reason, Verant would not attempt to try to code a spell allowing an illusion change to any NPC model in a particular zone? Or would Verant consider allowing enchanters to create illusions with no faction adjustments?]</i></font> <br><br>Illusions always have faction adjustments. They adjust the "race" portion of the faction formula. The game/faction engine does not allow someone to appear as a different race without adopting the faction settings for that race. As such, special allowances have been made for every race that can be illusioned. Opening more races to this would require a massive revamp of the faction engine and how it interacts with illusions. That revamp would constitute a major change to what defines EverQuest. Furthermore, the diversity the various areas in the game would surely lead to some bugs that would be implemented in the course of the revamp. Given these reasons, a change along these lines does not have benefits that outweigh cost. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Aside from faction issues, are you saying that by essentially allowing the 'minor illusion' spell to also include NPC models, in addition to the myriad of other object models in a particular zone, that this creates some sort of a problem? If so, could you please elaborate?]</i></font> <br><br>I think that I covered this one above. If I need to elaborate further, please let me know. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009655.html"><b>Harmony Upgrade</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Level 24 would be perfect for a harmony upgrade that could be castable indoors. I think this would greatly increase numbers in mid level dungeons, were crowed control is needed most.]</i></font> <br><br>Harmony is too powerful to extend to the indoors. We'd have to make it resistable and give a chance for the whole group of targets to come running in order to balance it.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009648.html"><b>More Hybrid Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi you said that hybrids spells are largely useless in a well balanced group <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009260.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009260.html</a>  ]</i></font><br><br>I just reread my post to that thread, and I believe that I indicated that the spells aren't useless even when in a group where the parnet class is present. I certainly didn't say that "hybrids spells are largely useless in a well-balanced group".<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009647.html"><b>Rowl's Day Off: Bug Found!</b></a><br>Oops :)<br><br>Rowyl's off for a couple of days but I'll mention it to him when he gets back. I'd agree that that is pretty useless until we get the change made. Unless if course if you want to type the emote out every time. Sorry about that.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009638.html"><b>Control Item Farming</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I will use the FBSS(flowing black silk sash) for my example. Consider if that only ONE FBSS can be looted by each player on a server. Each account allows 8 players per server. That means you could only loot 8 FBSS's per account, then you would have to purchase any others you might want(for whatever reason) from other players.]</i></font> <br><br>This is much like the "Lore for Life" suggestion that was posed here several months ago, suggesting that once an item was in a characters possession, that they could not get another one, whether it be via drop, or trade, or possibly a combination of one or another. It's an idea that I like, however not something that's compatible with EverQuest's core mechanics.

This would not ruin the economy as the items are already no drop nor would it throw the armor rate off balance as it already has been off balance negatively for months. Bottom line - no matter how you implement it, either the plane armor drop rate has to increase - or the number of places where you can get it has to increase. Either duplicate Fear and Hate, implement new planes or increase drop rate.]</i></font> <br><br>We've addressed the "multiple copy" proposals before. In short, this is not something that we would implement. It would indeed mess up the economy, create unmanagable server load, and be inconsistant with our ideals for the world.

Big day on the boards so far for Verant's Gordon Wrinn.  Here's what he's posted today so far on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009258.html"><b>Enchanter Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Will Enchanters ever get the ability to Illusion others? I know this MAY raise some faction issues, but then again so do the Druids wolf illusions. Anyhow, At higher levels, Illusion other: (insertrace here) would make up for the lack of illuions ant the higher levels. After all Enchanters are the "Master of Illusions" heck, we even get called illusionists at high levels. Please let me know what u think of this idea. I am rather curious]</i></font> <br><br>There have been several posts as of late concerning other illusions. One limitation is that certain models are only available in certain zones, where other models are available globally. Illusions are for the most part restricted to zones in which the model exists. It has been suggested that we should allow enchanters to illusion to the "nearest animate entity" in the zone, however that would indeed present faction issues. <br><br>Each illusion requires specific case-coding to handle the faction issues associated with each illusion. The number of different NPC body-types in the game would make that difficult, and in many cases impossible.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009254.html"><b>/guildmessage Suggestion</b></a><br>Hey there, just dropping a note to let you know that we've seen this request *many* times here on the boards. It's something that we may be able to do at some point, but we really can't promise it as a coming feature.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009260.html"><b>Rangers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. Spells givenn to Rangers are useless in groups and outside of groups do not allow Soloing exp giving mobs.]</i></font> <br><br>Out of your four points, I'd agree with all but #4. The spells aren't useless, and are only eclipsed when fighting in a group where there is a druid. Even then, the rangers mana can be used to do things like buff pets and help out between fights, so they aren't total invalidated. <br><br>Also, as I've mentioned before, the soloability argument isn't indicative of any problem, as the class is not designed to solo. Finally, your other three points simply state the design, and are also not indicative of any problems. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Archery is a Joke.]</i></font> <br><br>I disagree, especially after the double-damage upgrade above level 50. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And yes we do less damage Dual Yielding than Warriors.]</i></font> <br><br>There are many weapons out there that can be used by both warriors and rangers. Ranger damage output is within a percentage point or two of a warrior wielding a weapon of the same quality. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Do a who all Ranger 50-60 on Cazic thule with 2800 people on line and you will see 20-25 and who all Ranger 40 50 you see 20 more any day of the week. This should be telling you something.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, people didn't start complaining about drops in ranger numbers until the "rangers suck" drive started shortly after Kunark was released. It is, in my opinion, the same thing that happened in regards to rogues complaining on the boards about how bad they were. I think that the community is starting to realize how valuable rogues are at this point, so the numbers will start rising again. <br><br>Rangers might have a bit more of a difficult time ahead of them, as recovering from a "we suck" drive is very difficult. Remember that when a bunch of people get on the board and complain about how bad they feel their class is, other people read those posts and begin to believe that it's true. It's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009267-2.html"><b>Ralls and PvP Issues</b></a><br>The GM probably shouldn't have stated it in such absolute terms, but no, there are no plans to implement a move at present. That however does not equate to "There will be no move". <br><br>The quotes posted by Nanuvis-RZ on the first page of this thread still apply. And I do apologize, but this is not an issue that I'll be able to give periodic updates on, as we've been shifting priorities a bit here. <br><br>The PvP servers are still primarily PvE, like all of the other servers. PvP is there as an addition to the environment. As such, if we have to decide between changes that will improve things across all servers, or only on the PvP servers, we'll have to go with the one across all servers first. <br><br>My recommendation would be that if you absolutly cannot stand playing on Rallos any longer, you should create a character on one of the other servers and play there. As long as the population on Rallos continues to be strong, we're not going to assign priority to drastically changing the server environment. I'm not trying to be short or gruff, but we are going to need some type of sign that drastic changes are indeed wanted on that server beyond what's on these boards to provide us with a business reason to assign it some priority.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009261.html"><b>Crashing Bug</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone else having problems with the game crashing to their desktop from the character select screen? the first time it happened was when i tried zoning into WC,then i crashed,then i tried to enter norrath then it crashed again. Anyone else having this problem ?]</i></font> <br><br>There was a crash bug fixed in this patch that would cause people who had exited the game to crash upon trying to come back in, but that bug shouldn't have caused you to crash out of the game itself. We also included a bunch of code-optimizations in today's patch, so that might help out with some of the random crashes we've heard of.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009280.html"><b>Blacksmithing Question</b></a><br>I have a note in to the designer responsible for tradeskills to find out if this is an oversight or by design. I hope to have word back later today or tomorrow. You might also consider posting about this on the tradeskills board, which that designer will visit regularly.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009284.html"><b>Way to Stop Camping</b></a><br>This was suggested before under the moniker "Lore for Life". It's a nice idea that I like as a feature, but unfortunately not likely to be compatible with EQ at any point. It's one of those things that needs to be designed as a core foundation of the game in the begining.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009304.html"><b>EQ Slang Not Understood By All</b></a><br>I apologize for that. I usually try to define any abbreviation that I use at least once within my response if it isn't already defined by the poster. Sometimes I forget a couple :)<br><br>I have the same problem with some of the posts I read. I've had to go asking around the office just to see if someone knows that a particular abbreviation is. <br><br>By the way, what is a BMT?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009311.html"><b>No Drop = Soulbound?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I guess this isn't really a question, but rather a suggestion. Could you just make it so that a no drop item is soulbound in the way that Sebilis/Charisis/VP keys are?]</i></font> <br><br>We "soulbound" the keys so you wouldn't have to do the quest to get the key twice just for the purpose of going back and getting your body. Making all nodrop items soulbound is another matter entirely, and not related to the initial change. We did this as a matter of courtesy and to help players out. There was no balance issue or gameplay design that necessitated completing the key-quest twice. <br><br>Though we certainly won't make all nodrop items soulbound, we do indeed now have a way to add additional value items that are awarded. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009253.html"><b>Why do Hybrids have an EXP penalty?</b></a><br>This subject is fairly well covered in the FAQ at http:/everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009558.html"><b>Venril Sathir Faction</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just want to know if there will ever be a valid story line in the game to explain why I can't group with my friends in the dungeons in kunark which hit venril sathir faction.]</i></font> <br><br>I believe that the zones have been in long enough now that someone can reasonably extrapolate the story line involved. I'll give a hint to enable you to do some further research: <br><br>Who runs Karnor's, Charasis, and Kaesora?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009249.html"><b>Leveling</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon, if you wish to respond to this, respond with 'Actually Azrael178, there are tons of stuff that have yet to be figured out, even at your level.' I mean, only say that if it is true, but give me some clue as to how close I was when I said most everthing in game (save Planar/Veeshans Peak) has been solved.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually Azrael178, "Actually" is one of my favorite words (next to "evidently") :)<br><br>Seriously though, thanks for the post and I understand where you are coming from. It would be fair to say that most things in game have been solved by one person or another, which is why we keep putting new things in. It's certainly difficult if not impossible to put content in at a rate higher than it can be consumed. For instance, it takes an author months to write a book, while it takes only a few hours to read one. The guys here, for instance, have been working for weeks on putting together some really special quests for all of the classes. I think that it will only be a couple of weeks before they have all been solved by someone. <br><br>I think that the important thing here is that though things might have been solved by someone, they haven't been solved by you, yet. There is still tons of content out there for you to explore, and we put more in nearly every week. I think that we can entertain you for sometime to come :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009595.html"><b>Adding Target's Name to Socials</b></a><br>We do indeed plan on adding the "@" to the chat channels as well as emotes in the near future. I've also asked Rowyl to include additional identifiers for gender-specific subjective (he, she, it), objective (him, her, it), and possesive (his, her, its) pronouns.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009244.html"><b>The Unknown Pet Command</b></a><br>In beta, "/pet attack" would not automatically assume the target, so you had to enter the name, or get hit first to initiate the attack. At that time I created a macro of "/pet attack a". That handled most encounters fairly well :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009617.html"><b>Have NPC Pets Die With Master</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Makes sense. Happens to PCs. Why not NPCs too?]</i></font> <br><br>See the FAQ. NPCs can do things that PCs cannot.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009236.html"><b>More on Discussion of the Week</b></a><br>When the first thread was closed due to size, I started another at: <br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009074.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009074.html</a><br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009624.html"><b>Idea Suggestion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:We have wizards, that get some natural immunity to resistences. And we have spells that lower resist, and items that raise resist. So why no items that give you a bonus to cut through a mobs resist? Like most resist items, they are in of themselves not always the best item to wear durning normal day to day play. But there are times when you put them on for special occasions. An example would be fire resist items for a Naggy raid.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not sure I understand the question. <br><br>There are spells in the game that lower the resists of the target. There are items in game that increase your resists. There are items in game that proc spells that reduce the resistances of the target, and wizards innately roll versus lower resist-scores by the target once above level 35. <br><br>Are you asking for an item that YOU wear, that decreases the ability of the target to resist? If so, we do not have the ability to flag specific items with the ability to reduce the resist rate of a target without going through a spell effect. Furthermore, there are sufficient methods available to reduce resist scores on a target, so the suggested change really isn't something that is needed in game, and as such would be low priority if we ever did decide to move in this direction.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008466.html"><b>Sound Fix</b></a><br>To my knowledge, all known sound-related crash bugs were fixed a while ago. We are indeed working on a new sound engine to improve the way sounds are handled in EverQuest and improve the use of EAX though. <br><br>I do keep hearing enough anecdotal evidence concerning sound-related crashes to indicate that they still might be happening. What kind of card are you using? I have an SBLive in both my work and home PCs, and never crash with them. People having crashes usually say that they have an SBLive as well. If so, do you have all of the latest drivers? <br><br>Finally, if you disable your sound card in the device manager, do the crashes go away. Obviously I'm not suggesting that this is a "fix" for any sound related issue, but it is the final test to determine whether a crashing problem is sound-related.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009021-2.html"><b>The /Petition System</b></a><br>I've personally petitioned many times while in my player character to report names or profanity, however I've never petitioned for some issue requiring "help" within game. <br><br>This fairly well represents the average player in game. There are on the other hand players who petition quite frequently for help of one kind or another. Sometimes it's due to a run of bad luck or perhaps system-related issues. <br><br>At some point, I'd like to see us start tracking petitions made within the last month or so and using that data to establish priorities for helping the customers. Chances are that if someone hasn't petitioned in the last month, and he or she is petitioning now, they need help right away.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008941.html"><b>GMs as NPCs?</b></a><br>Uluhtc, <br><br>Did you lose experience when you died? If so, it was an NPC. If not, it was an actor. <br><br>In any case, I'm not at all familiar with this incident and I'll look into it tomorrow. I imagine that there is more story to what was going on than you may have been privy to at your particular point of interaction. <br><br>There are many different types of dynamic events that take place in game. Not all of them have to do with killing, though that does play a role of one kind or another in many of them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:If the GM had picked up the pieces]</i></font> <br><br>The important thing to remember is that an NPC being played by a human is not a GM.

Interesting news from the infamous pages of <a href="http://slashdot.org/yro/00/08/30/1652232.shtml">Slashdot.org</a> to bring you this afternoon.  It appears that after all these months a server emulator has finally been released.  Here's the report:<UL>Zummi writes "The people at <a href="http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch">HackersQuest</a> have released a beta of their Everquest server emulator. " Verant's  reaction should be interesting to watch - EthernalQuest looks cool, and will hopefully look better than the 1992 graphics of Everquest. </UL>An interesting thing to note is the fact that HackersQuest has been around for a long time and Verant has not as of yet shut them down.  Certainly questions come to mind regarding conflicts this has with the EULA, but on the other side Verant has done little to enforce their rules against auctioning <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&ht=1&SortProperty=MetaEndSort&query=EverQuest">accounts and items on eBay</a>.  <br><br>To discuss this issue more I have created a <b><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=6654186&start=6654186#6654186">special discussion thread</b></a> on our General Board where you can share and comment on this issue with the people of this community.<br><br>We'll bring you updates to this story as they occur.<br><br><s><b>Update:</b> Something else I thought I should note here is that HackersQuest is apparently is based in China. </s><br><br><b>Update:</b> Whoops, scratch that.  HackersQuest is based in Switzerland and not China as originally stated.

The new Patch Message is now up and available to read.  Here's a copy of the entire message:<UL>August 30th, 8:00am<br>------------------------<br><br>*Today's Patch*<br><br>Today we modified the EverQuest client to implement the following changes:<br><br>- Corrected a bug that would cause players to crash if they entered the<br>game, exited to the server selection screen, and tried to reenter the game.<br>- Corrected a bug that caused delays when switching between UI modes due to<br>the text wrapping change implemented last week.<br>- The /book command (/book #) now accepts pages 1 through 50, and will<br>switch to the proper page.<br>- Opening your spellbook will automatically cause you to begin meditating<br>providing that you have the skill.<br>- Removed the /meditate command since it is no longer necessary.<br>- You can now activate a hotkey while the spellbook is open by pressing the<br>corresponding number-key.<br>- The "/target [name]" command can be used to target other players by name.<br>Please note that this ability is subject to the range to the target.<br>- EverQuest will now write the original default colors when creating the<br>EQCLIENT.INI file, rather than the new colors that were put in a few weeks<br>ago.<br>- The @-character can be used in emotes to indicate a target.  For instance,<br>if you target "a gnoll" and type "/emote laughs cruelly at @", the output<br>will be, "Playername laughs cruelly at a gnoll".<br>- People with the /LFG (Looking for Group) flag set will now have their<br>over-head name prefixed with an asterisk.  Remember that you can search for<br>people looking for a group by using the "/who" and "/who all" commands.<br>Typing "/who all ranger 40 50 lfg" will return a list of all rangers between<br>40 and 50 that are looking for a group.<br>- The "Sense" series (Undead, Animal, and Summoned) will no longer point you<br>towards people's pets.<br><br>*Note on Voice Recognition*<br><br>Last week we implemented voice recognition technology in EverQuest.  To use<br>this new feature, please refer to the EQROKManualSupplement.doc file in your<br>EverQuest directory.  Please note that you must already have a voice<br>recognition engine that is compliant with the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI),<br>version 4.0.  The voice recognition technology was tested with Dragon<br>NaturallySpeaking(r) v4.0.  Check with the developer of your software to<br>find out if it is SAPI 4.0 compliant.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Arkinia!

Lady Daegarmo, Verant's Online Event Coordinator, made the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009223.html">following announcement</a> on the Gameplay Board:<UL><I>Greetings oh great warrior, I have traveled many days to reach you. Tales of your incredible deeds and great actions have reached my council, and to be honest, we are impressed with what we have learned. We watched in the shadows as you showed your bravery by defeating the evil dragons. We saw from a distance your unequal skill and courage when you banished gods from their own planes. Even Tunare herself has mentioned your name when she talks of the heroes of the Plane of Mortals.<br><br>We have heard of others who have similar accomplishments, and the gods have begun debate amongst themselves on who has created the ultimate champion. Of course, the dreaded Rallos Zek claims that his warriors would crush any that oppose his followers, but there are many that disagree. <br><br>Mithaniel Marr, in the plane of Valor, a place where the greatest tournaments are held, decreed that he would solve this dispute by holding a tournament of mortals that would forever answer the question on whose creation was superior. Those not in good standing with Mithaniel objected, stated that the event would be biased in his plane, and that neutral ground would be the only answer. <br><br>Being the Avatar of Truth, and bound by my code of honor to be forever unbiased regardless of race or profession, was summoned to this council and given this honorable quest to fulfill.<br><br>&#8220;Bring together the Myrmidons and Warlords, to a single place and a single time, and find the champion of mortals. Those that compete at the regional level and emerge victorious, grant them the title of &#8220;the Champion&#8221; by authorization of Rallos Zek. In the final event, where the heroes are brought together from all realms of the mortals, those that place 4th through 2nd shall be awarded the title of &#8220;the Myrmidon&#8221;, by authorization of the Tribunal. The winner of the final match, who has not lost to another mortal, under Authorization of Mithaniel Marr shall be awarded the title &#8220;the Warlord&#8221; and crowned the champion of Norrath.&#8221;<br><br>It had been many ages since I had been requested to accomplish such a quest. Rules would have to be fair, for even Cazic Thule, in his blindness, would be able to see if the event would be biased twords one of the gods creations. From Gnome to Ogre, and Human to Iksar, all would have to be equal.<br><br>Some gods had given artifacts to faithful followers, that placed them above most mortals, clearly an advantage that would need to be dismissed. Therefore, let it be known that all Artifacts will be banished from this event.<br><br>Several of the gods had blessed their children into riches with great armies, which could afford the wealth of many items and equipment. This would advantage some races over others, which could not be involved in the event. Therefore, let it be known that all activatable items will be banished from this event. Of course, great warrior, you may wear the items that have the special abilities imbedded into them, just not use those items against another player in the forms of spells or potions or pumice or effects.<br><br>Finally the use of weapons was agreed upon, and weapons based of trickery and deceit were banished from the event by Mithaniel. Rallos disagreed stating that a true warrior uses any weapon or equipment to his advantage, and they argued. Finally my recommendation pleased them both, and these weapons were banished from the primary hand of the warrior, only to be used in the offhand. Therefore, let it be known, that all weapons of deceit (weapons with a delay value of 15 or lower) shall only be allowed in the offhand of the competitors.<br><br>Leave your gold pouch in the bank, for no entry fee shall be requested or accepted in this event. Seek the knowledge of the gods for the time and place of regional (Server) tournaments before the greatest are gathered to one spot (test server) for the final event.<br>This is my quest, and my message to you my champion. I hope you accept this quest as well as a personal goal to come and compete at the event of the gods. If the challenge is too great, I assure you that your god shall forgive you, for only the bravest and best need step forward.<br><br>Fare well, I hope we meet again.<br><br><br>Server Tournaments<br><br>Fri Sept 1st, 2000<br>Xegony 6pm PST<br>E Marr 6pm PST<br>Quellious 6pm PST<br><br>Sat Sept 2nd, 2000<br>Vallon Zek 4pm PST<br>Innoruuk 8pm PST<br>The Rathe 7pm PST<br>7th Hammer 5pm PST<br><br>Sun Sept 3rd, 2000<br>T Thule 6pm PST<br>Lanys 430pm PST<br>Veeshan 6pm PST<br>T Marr 3pm PST<br><br>Tue Sept 5th, 2000<br>Bertox 7pm PST<br>Fennin 5pm PST<br>E`Ci 4pm PST<br>Sol Ro 5pm PST<br>Rodcet 6pm PST<br><br>Wed Sept 6th, 2000<br>Rallos 5pm PST<br>Karana 4pm PST<br>Nameless 6pm PST<br><br>Thur Sept 7th, 2000<br>Luclin 7pm PST<br>Torv 6pm PST<br>Saryrn 5pm PST<br>Tribunal 4pm PST<br><br>Fri Sept 8th, 2000<br>Brell 7pm PST<br>M Marr 4pm PST<br>M Thule 5pm PST<br><br>Sat Sept 9th, 2000<br>Prexus 5pm PST<br><br>TBA<br>Tallon Zek<br>Tunare<br>Bristle<br>Druzzil<br>Povar<br>C Thule<br><br>Sun Sept 10, 2000<br>Final Event - Test Server<br><br>All TBA's will be announced shortly<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Events Coordinator<br>Verant Interactive</I></UL>Here's post #2:<UL>Tarew Marr was listed twice:<br>Sun Sept 3rd, 2000<br>T Marr 3pm PST<br><br>Wed Sept 6th, 2000<br>T Marr 6pm PST<br><br><br>Please tell me it's the wednesday time :)<br><br><b><I>Ack!<br><br>Yes it appears the server did sign up twice, I have talked with the GM of the server and they wish it to be held on the Third.<br><br>Sorry about that, my mistake<br><br>=(<br><br>Dae</b></i></UL>Thanks Gordon! :)

Sheesh, how many infobit posts can we do today? :)  Here's the latest round of quotes and excerpts from EverQuest's UI designer Rowyl:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008621.html"><b>Suggestions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  1. If you have a wheel-mouse, how about enabling the wheel so that it can be used to scroll the text window? It would need to be pretty speedy, so I would suggest scrolling by page, not by line. <br><br>2. When healing yourself, would it be possible to stop your health bar shooting up and then settling back down to a lower value? <br><br>3. Could there be an 'exchange and bank' button on the bank screen that automatically transfers all your money to your bank vault and changes it into the highest value coin, so avoiding the rather laborious multiple-clicking. I would not consider this to be anti-roleplay because it is what you would ask a bank cashier to do anyway. <br><br>4. It would be really really good if there was an option to switch off the ability to right-click on a player to examine them. It is useful and fast to right-click to con MOBs, and when a player is in the way it is both annoying and time consuming, especially in a battle situation. <br><br>5. Pretty low priority, but it would be nice if containers remembered where they opened on screen. I would imagine the simplest solution to implement would be to store a location for each inventory slot, rather than for each container. If a container is in a particular inventory slot, that container uses the slots stored position when it opens. If another container is switched into that same slot, then it would use the same location. Locations would be updated when a container is moved around the screen.]</i></font><br><br>I will look into 1, 2, 4, and 5, I doubt number 3 is going to happen.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007814.html"><b>Ctrl-# Casting</b></a><br>I still plan to get ctrl-# = cast spell in, but I have other things to deal with first. Hopefully soon.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007771.html"><b>Guild List for Guild Leaders</b></a><br>The problem here is that the server doesn't keep a list of who's in a guild. <br><br>We have a list of guilds, and each character record has an index into that list. <br><br>With thousands of character per server it's not feasable to search the entire database to generate a list of who's in the guild. <br><br>While I agree this would be a nice feature, it's just not gonna happen. Sorry.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007769.html"><b>/Pause?</b></a><br>If I were to add a /pause # or /delay # command you would likely not be able to do anything during the pause (kinda like it is when you cast a spell). <br><br>It that ok?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007705.html"><b>Rowyl's Mission</b></a><br>I'm assigned to work on the user interface, I do NOT work on class related issues, or NPC AI, or pathing, or spells (except maybe the graphics for the UI elements), or skill, or items. <br><br>The main reason you see my changes now, is that they are small and relatively easy to do. The second reason being that most of my issue do not relate to class balance, or gameplay, and those changes are not made lightly. They have to be discussed and planned out. <br><br>So, you will continue to see UI changes while not seeing other issues changed. I'm sorry, but that is the way it's going to be.</UL>

Soulsender was kind enough to write and send us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>GM Event last night in Quellious, Kurn's Tower<br> <br>    For some weeks now, an alliance of Iksar Swiftails and Greenmist Knights have been conducting a siege of Kurn's Tower in the Field of Bone. Fighting under the name "Architects of Kurn", the collective swore to rid the ruins from ceiling to basement of all that oppose Iksar traditions and defile the name of Kurn. Last eve this siege passed into the eyes of the Gods and a grand battle was staged.<br> <br>    In deepest night, numerous Bone Golems appeared in the Field of Bone menacing and threatening revenge for recent assaults on the tower. Swearing allegiance to one "Sleak Pox", the Bone Golems tore in to ranks of unseasoned Iksar hunting the field, before being dispatched by more veteran warriors. It was soon determined that the Golems were calling Kurn's home their own, and the tower was stormed once again.<br> <br>    Upon entrance, a brave Greenmist Knight was dispatched -hidden from the vision of dutiful dead- to discover the whereabouts of Sleak Pox. Not long thereafter, horrific cries rang out in the tower -the Knight had been set-upon by Shades and Lesser Spectres in the Dining Room of Kurn! Flying to his aid, the Architects of Kurn stormed the first staircase and ascended the bridge. A pitched battle was waged on the second landing before entrance to the hall was gained. <br> <br>    Unfortunately, at this time, hot Iksar blood seemed to overheat. Instead of our planned, cunning assault, single warriors charged in to the dining room to confront Pox on his own terms. I tell you, friends, it was near a slaughter! Although only two Iksar fell, the rest were forced to flee back the way they had come, to tend to wounds and plan anew.<br> <br>    During the plan and associated rescue of the dead, a great war of words was waged between the Chief Architects and Sleak Pox. Eventually, so riled did he become that, forgetting the safety of his undead legions, Sleak Pox decided to confront the gathering alone atop the tower bridge beyond the stairs. <br> <br>    The second battle was glorious to behold. The Touch of Hate did serve Cazic-Thule well, as Greenmist Knights delivered blow after blow on Sleak Pox. The swiftness of Iksar Monk attacks left him dazed, battered and broken. Try as he might, Sleak Pox was here no match for Iksar blades and fists bent on vengeance. He fell in a tumbling heap down the stairs and was pronounced dead!<br> <br>    Deep rejoicing -the likes of which, I think, has not graced the tower since Kurn's departure- did then occur. To follow up the great battle, the remaining Architects decided to launch an attack in to the basement, and fought deep in to the night for celebration.<br> <br>    Soulsender, Architect of Kurn<br>    Shadow Knight of the 17 Wound.<br> <br>    /ooc Everyone who attended this even had a fantastic time! It was a lower-level event, and so not attended by a ton of gawkers or     super-twinks. Most everyone taunted and stayed in character the whole time, and even the ninja-looting of Pox's loot did                 not serve to effect the evening badly.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

Verant Vice President Brad McQuaid made a few posts recently on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009130.html"><b>Leveling in Kunark</b></a><br>I just leveled my mid 20s ranger in Lake of Ill Omen pretty quickly. <br><br>Velious, btw, is targetted for 35-60, but yes, Kunark is for all levels.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006032-3.html"><b>Clipping Plane</b></a><br>Here's the deal: <br><br>The bug with the rain is very low priority. <br><br>Slightly higher priority is having a game designer go through ALL outdoor zones and revisit the max clipping distance associated with the zone. <br><br>IF the zone doesn't have an artifically limited clip for effect (eg. Toxxulia Forest), the game designer will make the max clip the farthest it can be based on the max distance used when exporting the zone (it can't go farther, else things will cease to draw correctly). <br><br>As stated before, several months ago when I posted on the subject, this is low priority (getting FA style quests in the game, revamping lesser used dungeons, working on Velious, etc. are all higher priority). <br><br>Other than the wierd rain bug and the fact that apparently several zones could indeed have their max clip increased, I do NOT believe there is any 'bug'.<br>--<br>Darkmatter, I know this is your personal crusade, and I respect that :)<br><br>We DID, in my opinion, get to the bottom of it: for some reason, either in code or in data, many of the zones' max clipping planes were apparently reduced at some point. <br><br>I think your problem is with the priority we are assigning this issue, and I apologize that it's not high enough for some of you. <br><br>The plan is to have a game designer go into the data for each zone and move the clipping plane maximum out as appropriate. <br><br>If that fails, we'll look at it in code (which would involve a programmer). But my inclination is that the data change will solve the problem. <br><br>Again, it's not very high on the priority list. The FA style quests are (and are near being ready for testing, btw.), as are the dungeon revamps (which will be focussed on after the FA style quests).<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009182.html"><b>Firiona Vie & "PlayElf"</b></a><br>Firiona Vie in PlayElf? <br><br>Bah, they couldn't pay her enough :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009182.html"><b>Artwork Getting More Risque in EQ?</b></a><br>I'll look at the art again, but I'm pretty sure she's wearing essentially the same costume. <br><br>I'm pretty sure Keith Parkinson is adding more fur and other minor modifications to her costume to reflect that it's rather cold in Velious (or at least, in most of it). <br><br>That said, her overall look will remain the same. <br><br>Mr_disco: we hope to have some introductory GM events near Velious launch that will explain her escape from the Iksar and the re-discovery of Velious. <br><br>Aegris: I'm pretty sure you can see a mock-up box cover on EB's web page -- it uses some initial Parkinson artwork.</UL>

Gordon made quite a few more posts since the first infobit news report was made.  Here's all the latest from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009142.html"><b>Clarity Duration Decrased?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Please look into wether or not the duration to clarity was decreased.]</i></font> <br><br>We haven't changed it. Rest assured that if it had been lessened, there would have been an explosion here on the boards.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009197.html"><b>Popup Ads on Official Boards</b></a><br>Erm. Sorry. I'll forward the info to our ad integration department. <br>--<br>Just realized that I wasn't clear in my last post, the intrusive ads will be taken down.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009206.html"><b>Tradesfolk Forum</b></a><br>Due to popular opinion, we've reopened the Coalition of Tradesfolk forum for the discussion of Tradeskills. <br><br>As an added bonus, the game designer who is now responsible for them will be on the board regularly. Enjoy!<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009136.html"><b>Quote that Broke the Camel's Back</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Yes, if you're soling, there's a boatload of downtime. If you have a well balanced group, you can fight with very little downtime for as long as you like.  Downtime is a problem if you are not in a well-balanced group. If you are soloing, then the price you pay for that is extended downtime.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for mentioning that Slackjaw and a_cleric00, it's very true. A well balanced group can maintain a very good pace. Frankly, if someone is ever medding 10 minutes out of every 12, they might want to look into trying to balance out their group with complementary classes. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi gave a technical reason to avoid a philosophical one.  Quite simply, they don't want to change the pace of the game. ]</i></font><br><br>You are indeed correct on all counts except about avoiding the philosophical one :)  We've been saying for a long time that we are not going to make any drastic changes to the core foundations of EverQuest. If we did so, the game would no longer be "EverQuest". It would be bad business to make drastic foundational changes to a successful product. If you read the FAQ, there's an excellent section that explains doing just this.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009130.html"><b>Luck and Kunark</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ok.. I'm not an idiot. I TRIED to get into Kunark. I guess I must just have the WORST luck on the planet. =( ]</i></font><br><br>Your luck cannot be worse than mine. Back in early beta, friends started referring to my character as "the Often Dead". It still follows me today :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009133.html"><b>Will you buy another Verant game?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Right now i'd have to say yes, I'd buy another V game. I haven't agreed with some of their design and balancing decisions, but overall I enjoy the game and would certaintly try one of their future products. <br><br>One of my biggest gripes about Verant is their poor quality control. Broken quests, stuff in patches that didn't go live, stuff that went live that wasn't in the patch. Stuff that was in the patch but didn't work. I think they're getting better though and their next game will probably be better managed. Nothing like learning on the job]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for the honest evaluation. It's far more useful when people bring up both positive and negative issues rather than being all on one side or the other all of the time. <br><br>Concerning some of the problems that you've cited, guilty as charged. We have indeed made some mistakes and will probably continue to make them from time to time. The goal of course is to learn from our mistakes and reduce the recurrence of the same mistakes.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009115.html"><b>/Yell Upgrades</b></a><br>I do think that it's a good idea, and it's been forwarded to Rowyl with the other good UI enhancements that have been recommended. However, as it is part of a wish list, it's not something that I can give a periodic status update about.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008968.html"><b>"The Lost Zones"</b></a><br>This text will be in the next version of the FAQ: <br><br>If you&#8217;ve ever read fantasy novels, you might have noticed that many if not most of them have a map of the world within the first few pages. These maps contain areas, cities, features, and sometimes, entire continents, that aren&#8217;t necessarily visited during the scope of the novel. They are there because they are part of the world, even if the protagonists never reach those locations. <br><br>EverQuest is no different in this respect. Sometimes, the areas listed on the maps name areas in existing zones. Other times, the listed areas are room for expansion later in the story. All the areas on the map that do not have a zone or area associated with them for possible future expansion. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009053.html"><b>Linkdeath</b></a><br>I appreciate the time that you took to write this up. Let me see if I can explain the current technology is as much detail. <br><br>Pets can only exist in the world when their owner also exists in the world, meaning that once the owner disappears, so does the pet. At the same time, the character goes linkdead, that character cannot reenter the game until they are removed from the world. <br><br>Once a character is removed from the world, the world has no knowledge of the existence of the character. As such, the world no longer processes data relative to the characater, since the character does not exist. That is why NORENT objects are removed as the character is being removed, since the world has no knowledge of the character once they are gone. <br><br>Certain parts of the description above are core system mechanics for EverQuest that it wouldn't make sense to change after several years of getting them operating just right. That said, we do have some plans to improve the current situation in the works. I can't comment specifically on them until we have some new things implemented and tested on the Test Server.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008261.html"><b>Target Variables</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: is there string you can insert into text that will insert your targets name into emotes and such? <br>monsters can get my name. /poke, /bonk, etc use the name of the target.. there has to be a way.. is it availiable to the users?]</i></font> <br><br>Roy and I have spoken about this and it is on his plate. We're also looking into allowing people to customize their own emote text while using canned animations. For instance, instead of /wave always returning "User waves at Bob", perhaps you could type "/wave waves happily at %T", which would return "User waves happily at Bob" (assuming Bob is the target). <br><br>No promises just yet on whether this will absolutely be implemented nor a specific timeframe. I'll look into seeing if I can get more information narrowed down in the near future.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008673.html"><b>Harvest Casting Time</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The spell gives back aprox half a bubble of mana, not a FULL bubble by any means... ]</i></font><br><br>That would depend on what gear you are wearing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why does Harvest have such a loonngg casting time?<br>Other mana regen type spells have a low casting time. Why? B ]</i></font><br><br>Those other spells do not instantly give a huge chunk of mana. The casting time, stun, and recast time associated with the spell account for that fact.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008804.html"><b>Pet Command Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If the above is not posible or you feel it is in some way unbalanceing I would like to ask if you can check the range on the "/pet report health" comand and posibly expand it. I realize you did this a few patches back but it seems to have grown smaller and this poses some seiour gamplay problems for me and other pet classes.]</i></font> <br><br>All pet commands work based on range to the pet. There is range associated with these commands both due to realism and to have some disadvantages associated with pets in certain cases. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I would like to propose a third health bar to be blaced under the stamina bar that shows the pet's health. It could be green (you haven't used that color yet). I can't see how this would be unbalanceing.]</i></font> <br><br>Hitting F1 twice will target your pet. If you do this you can then hit /assist to target the creature again. We wouldn't really want to make the data more accessible than it currently is. The lack of immediatly and always-available data is one of the disadvantages mentioned above.</UL>

Gordon kept busy this afternoon with several new posts to the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008933.html"><b>FD & /Quiting Out?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "FD will work 25% of the time on wanderers, 90% of the time when the creatures return to their post."]</i></font> <br><br>All creatures forget about a successfully feigned character once the creature returns to it's spawn point. That of course doesn't apply to creatures that don't have a static spawn. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Monks hate having to do it, and would prefer that FD worked the old way so that we could use our skill without endangering other adventurers in dungeons. This "cheat", as you call it, is your friendly neighborhood monk's attempt at being as little an inconvenience to you as possible. Don't give them a bad time about it.]</i></font> <br><br>It has been suggested that make anyone feigned automatically "stand up" upon a /q, however we don't have any plans to implement that in the foreseeable future.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008967.html"><b>EverQuest Isn't for Everyone</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  As a casual gamer I don't have hours and hours to sit and play. Unfortunately to get anywhere in this game that's what is REQUIRED.]</i></font> <br><br>It's only "required" because you perceive the need to attain the same levels and equipment as the guy who plays 12 hours per day, even though you only have that many hours per week to play yourself. There are many players of this same type, one which I refer to as the "time-starved powergamer", rather than the "casual gamer". <br><br>The time-starved powergamer holds the same desires and drives as the powergamer, but only has limited time to play due to real-life concerns. The player is driven by advancement and acquisition, whereas the casual gamer is more interested in the gaming experience. <br><br>Would it make sense for us to create a game based around the 10 hours per week figure when the average player plays around 23? The game is set up around that average figure, and someone playing that average amount of time can expect to progress at an average rate. The consequence of this is that people who play double or triple that progress much faster, and people who play half that often want to progress as fast, on a calander basis, as those who play double or triple the average. <br><br>Regardless the advancement or acquisition rate in game, there will always be people who play less than the average. It wouldn't make sense for us to gear the game so that people who play less than average progress at fastest rate. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As for racing to 60, well you assigned us levels and when you set a cap you set a goal. Everyone wants to achieve that goal although the vast majority never will. 50 was attainable but 60? It's a pipe dream for most and probably the number one reason people will quit EQ because they simply accept the fact it is beyond reach.]</i></font> <br><br>We never expected every play to reach level 50, and certainly never expect everyone to reach level 60 either. The "average" player will reach "average" levels and will never "max out". The important thing is that those levels are there for the people who decide to advance to that point and have the time to do so. I see from your post that your character is level 39 now. That's a very respectable level for someone who can only play a few hours per week. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Make it so we each have an equal chance to achieve all that is achievable in the game with the exclusion of Veeshan's Peak. Make that dungeon so tough that 200 of your best powergamers can never make it 100 yards into it. That should keep them occupied for a while.]</i></font> <br><br>Games of this nature have to service a broad range of different player types. Sometimes servicing one type of player molds the game in a direction that isn't liked by another type. This will always be the case. Your post seems to suggest that you think that every gamer, regardless of how much time they put in, should be able to go everywhere and do everything. Would it make sense for us to make a game geared with 10 hours per week as an average? Or what of a game geared to 5 hours per week on average? To do what you suggest, that being allowing the 10 hours per week player to advance and acquire at the same rate as is enjoyed by the current 40 hour per week player, we'd have to set the average to about 2 hours per week. What fun would the game be for the average player then? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: EQ should allow everyone the same opportunity to achieve the same items and experience ]</i></font><br><br>Opportunity is a constant. Everyone in game has the same opportunity. They then decide how much of that opportunity they wish to pursue, guided by personal desires and real-life factors. The variable here is the time that you have to play, and it is that you do not have. <br><br>I do not think that it is fair to say that EQ does not support the casual gamer. It would be fair to say that someone who has more time to play EQ can advance and acquire at a faster rate. However, is there anything really wrong with that?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009074.html"><b>Discussion of the Week: Continued</b></a><br>I'm impressed with the number of well thought-out discussions taking place in regards to this topic. As many of you have noticed, the size of the original thread has reached the point where it needs to be closed. I still have to go through it and replies to this one as well to compose some comments, which I'll do later today. Until then, here's the continuation of the thread.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008894.html"><b>Weapon Nerfs</b></a><br>Sevrus_MT, <br><br>My initial post on the subject announcing the plans in regards to these weapons said: <br><br>"While we have no problem with weapons of this delay, they should not have been placed as loot on anything other than deity or dragon level encounters." <br><br>The weapon quoted is indeed on such an encounter.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008845.html"><b>20 Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Camping. Why couldn't the "long portion" of the camp be put at the OTHER end of the camp? Perhaps the NPC needs time to "craft" the quest item and changes in some way to show that they are ready to give the reward. Let the other items spawn almost continuously, and people would NEED to camp anything but the reward PC. ]</i></font><br><br>It's a doable idea, but wouldn't this be just a camp by another name? Whether I'm camping a creature that I want to kill, or one I want to talk to, it's still a camp. In this case, I can see 20 people standing around an NPC waiting for him to "be ready" and fighting over who can hand him the items fastest. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Are there currently any suits of armor that give some "hidden" effect or bonus by virtue of wearing the entire suit? ]</i></font><br><br>No, there are not. It's a good idea though that might have some application for later implementation or future products. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Are there currently any weapons in the game that have any "hidden" effect? ]</i></font><br><br>Not really. What an item can do is expressly stated upon it. We do have some plans for more cursed weaponry in the future, of course we just might have to be creative to "hide" the effect of the curse. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. If the answer to 2 and/or 3 is "no", are there any plans to add this feature to the game? ]</i></font><br><br>See above. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. You once said that GZ was going to conduct some tests with the wizard's spells vs. the other caster classes. Have these been completed? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually I believe that Brad said that, and it is indeed our opinion that offensive power is appropriate for the class. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6. Why, exactly, was the definition of the wizard class changed on the everquest.com page under the classes section? ]</i></font><br><br>What change and when was it made? To my knowledge, it has read what it reads now since release. I believe that there was a change at one time in the beta period where it was changed from "damage" to "magical damage", but that's all I believe happened. Was there something else? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7. Are there any plans to introduce items that directly influence/enhance trade skills? (Gnomish Jeweler's Loupe, Dwarven Smith's Hammer, Elven Sewing Needle, etc.)]</i></font> <br><br>Do you mean items that allow you to make better items with trades? It's a good idea, but we no firm plans in that direction. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 8. Why, since dwarves in fantasy literature (and even in EQ) are the finest smiths in all the realms, is there no ore in Kaladim? It even has a mine. ]</i></font><br><br>Good question. There's no ore in Kaladim? Hmmm, I'll check into that to see if it was a design or an oversight. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 9. Why can't enchanters be given a high-level illusion that allows them to change into the nearest ANIMATE object? ]</i></font><br><br>Races are a component of faction, and you adopt whatever race-faction you emulate. There's a lot of special case-coding to handle the animate races that players currently emulate. Opening that up to nearly everything else would be extremely problematic, if not impossible. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 10. Are there any plans to introduce a spell or item that absorbs magic directed at the wielder, perhaps converting it directly into mana/hit points? ]</i></font><br><br>There is already a bard song that has a damage shield that absorbs magical damage. There's also a cleric "reverse damage shield" that heals anyone that hits the target. That's the extent of what we have, and nothing new along these lines are planned. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 11. Are there any plans to introduce a spell or item that REFLECTS spells back at the caster? ]</i></font><br><br>No. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 12. Why can't the monk-only weapons that look like gloves be worn on the hands, and add directly to the ATTACK stat instead of requiring them to be 1h blunt? ]</i></font><br><br>Items cannot be set to use hand-to-hand skill, and combat can't go to an "equipment" slot to get combat statistics. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 13. If Verant doesn't like "spoiler sites", then why are there no spell descriptions anywhere in the game? ]</i></font><br><br>I think that you've answered your own question. We don't like spoilers. We'd prefer people figure these things out on their own and maintain their own knowledge-base. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 14. Will players ever be able to construct golems? (A.k.a. summon a temporary "golem-type" pet through some complicated quest) ]</i></font><br><br>We could certainly, by use of trade skill or quest, award an item that summoned a pet of any particular type, however we have no plans to do that at present. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 15. Necros can charm the undead; enchanters can charm...well...everything. Will Magicians ever have the ability/spell to charm elementals or other summoned creatures? ]</i></font><br><br>No, we have no plans along these lines at present. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 16. Are there any plans for an expansion geared toward the 10 - 30 range of player rather than the higher levels? ]</i></font><br><br>Velious is geared towards a higher level-range, however Kunark has support for all level ranges. <br><br>With Velious, the thinking is that there is already plenty of content to support the continually migrating portion of the customer-base that is in the 10-30 range. <br><br>I'm unable to talk about any post-Velious plans at this time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 17. The Trackers' Water Extractor - This is currently broken, is it not? The purification tablets do not seem to exist, and the NPC that mentions them won't respond. ]</i></font><br><br>I inquired about this time time back, when Kunark first launched, and it was verified at the time that the tablets do exist. If I need to check into it further, please let me know. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 18. Bandages vs. Aloe Swatches vs. Maneater Plant Salve vs. Tailored Silk Bandages: Is there any difference other than price i.e. More healing, faster healing, etc. ]</i></font><br><br>No difference at this time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 19. Are there any plans to give clerics any type of special ability that is tied to whatever deity they worship? ]</i></font><br><br>No, there are currently no plans along these lines. However, there are plans and implemented pieces of deity-specific quests that return deity-specific rewards. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 20. Are there any races and/or classes that you, personally, would like to see added to the game? ]</i></font><br><br>If we added a warrior/wizard hybrid, could we call him a "fire fighter"?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008814.html"><b>Mez and Bind Wound</b></a><br>I'd agree that being able to bind wounds while mesmerized is a bug. However can someone really bind wounds that much through the duration of the mez to make it much of a big deal? Do the posters feel that this is worth "correcting"? If we do correct it, it won't be on just the PvP servers, but across all of them.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008803.html"><b>Customer Dis-Satisfaction Reduction</b></a><br>Interesting idea. I don't see any issues that would prevent us from putting something like this in. I'll chat with the team about it and see what they think. And for future reference, can we speak of "increasing customer satisfaction" rather than "reducing customer dis-satisfaction" in the future?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008661.html"><b>Bug on Tallon Zek?</b></a><br>I'd have to go with Brega on this one. Personally, whether I lose the cash to another player or destroy it right before death is inconsequential. Giving it some thought, I'd rather they loot it, because I then have a chance to come back and kill them before they have a chance to bank it. <br><br>I don't think that it's enough of an issue to pursue further at this point. Perhaps if others are of the same feelings as the original poster, we can give it some more thought.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008296.html"><b>Guild Accounts at Banks?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Because it would take work.]</i></font> <br><br>Every change takes work, it's just a question of how much work and whether or not the benefits of the change are worth diverting the manpower from other things that they could be working on, and whether the suggested changes are consistant with the game world. <br><br>I think that the suggestion does meet the "consistant with the game world" qualification, but am not sure that it would apply well to the others. Guilds do not currently exist as an entity, but rather as an entry within each character file. In order to implement this, guilds would have to be converted to be an entity all their own. Secondly, restrictions for nodrop and lore items would have to be implemented in ways that would only apply to guild banks. <br><br>It's not just work, but a substantial amount of manpower that's probably better served elsewhere at present. We won't rule it out completely though.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008528.html"><b>Cleric Issue</b></a><br>Though we just gained the ability to restrict items by deity, and could do the same with spells, we really don't have any plans to pursue this idea at present. There's enough issues with class and race balance, without having to likewise balance spells for deities within existing race/class combos.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008653.html"><b>Verant Ruined My Life!</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: OK I am an EQ addict.
