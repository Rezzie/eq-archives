Someone <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033878.html">posted the FTC rules for commerce</a> on the Gameplay Board last night.

Here's what he posted:<br><UL><i>Here's my thoughts:<br>We don't need "the law" to tell us the difference between right and wrong. We have screwed up and will do right by our customers. If you don't have it by Monday, we'll be giving a free month of EverQuest (as long as it was ordered in a reasonable amount of time (i.e. someone in Taiwan that ordered it today shouldn't expect to get it by Monday).<br><br>Believe me it's painful to watch this happen. We're not jumping for joy here watching people get pissed about this. We planned extensively (despite appearences) and to watch some unexpected glitches mess us up is quite depressing.<br><br>All we can do is work through the problems, fix them and make it up to our customers.<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</i></UL>

It will be a one-day event, lasting as long as we need it to, in Qeynos Hills. Here are the rules as<br>we've discussed them. <br><br>1) No DOT spells. This is due to exp. loss if you die from these spells. <br>2) No using the zone's NPC's in anyway to cause damage to the other side. No training NPC's and no<br>charmed NPC's. Caster pets are allowed. <br>3) Non-participants must be listed beforehand, so that they are not attacked. Anyone who attacks a<br>non-combatant is disqualified. Also, non-combatants cannot assist with buffs or heals in combats between<br>guilds. <br>4) No bind point or corpse camping. Also, in battles between the guild, one death is all you get. No one can<br>die, get their corpse and rejoin the battle. Everyone is allowed to get their corpse, but no one can reenter<br>the fights. <br>5) No looting. <br><br>Type of fights to take place: <br>1) Assassin - One player, the target, from the Daggers will be accompanied by a group of 6 members of the<br>Daggers, who are to escort him from one end of the zone to the other, i.e. from Qeynos to Surefall glade.<br>The other guild puts a group of 6 into the zone, with the purpose of killing the target. If they succeed, roles<br>are reversed, and the Heroes have a target to protect. Best 2 out of 3 tries at this. <br>2) Group hunts - Each guild has a group of 6 that enter the zone from opposite ends. They are to hunt each<br>other, in what ever way they see fit. Whichever guild has the last man standing wins. We can do multiple<br>groups if we have enough people who want to. <br>3) If there are enough members on both sides, we get together for one big Braveheart-esque battle, a huge<br>scrum. <br><br>To WAR!<br><br>Haemish<br>Clan Chieftan<br>The Silver Daggers<br><a href="http://silverdaggers.freehosting.net">http://silverdaggers.freehosting.net</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

This one is really crazy. :)  <a href="http://www.sudzywudzy.com/cadesign/index.html">The "Official" EverQuest Kunark Kamp</a> page was recently opened.

Gordon made a big reply to a post regarding GMs, Guides and EQ customer support on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the thread:<UL><i>Winged_Mercury, <P>All of the things that you ask for in your post are already in place. <P></i><b>After reading these posts, I have come to a conclusion: Verant needs to replace their volunteers with paid employees. </b><i><P>Our GMs are paid employees. The Guides on the other hand are volunteers who supplement our staff and assist the players. </i><P><b>In addition, GM's should NOT be allowed to ban customers without proper authorization from a manager or supervisor. </b><p><i>Please keep in mind that the term GM is used to describe anyone with powers in game that operates as part of our customer-service organization. The customer service organization has several layers: GM, Lead GM, Head GM, CS Manager. The organization is setup to deal with all issues specific to the organization internally. For instance, approval from the CEO of the company is not required to ban an account. <P>In regards to your statement though, GMs cannot ban accounts without proper authorization from a manager or supervisor (Lead GM or above). <P></i><b>Please don't mistake my point here; Having volunteer GMs can be beneficial in adding a sense of realism to the game and helping to coordinate the activities of the customers. Having the same GM's making business decisions regarding customer accounts is not. <P></b><i>Volunteer CS reps (Guides) do not have the ability to take direct action against any customer's account. <P></i><b>One other suggestion. The layer of supervision I talk about should be across all servers. That is to say that the same resources would be utilized for all servers. That way, the decisions made regarding customers accounts would have a sense of continuity. <P><i></b>The layer of supervision *is* across all servers, for all intents and purposes. Where GMs are assigned to a particular server, Lead GMs and above float to where necessary in order to consult and make decisions in regard to the issues you mention. </i><P><b>Up to this point, the handling of customers accounts in-game is best described as arbitrary.</b><P><i> I believe that this observation is based upon your limited understanding of our current organization. This isn't your fault, I think that there are a lot of misunderstandings out there about how things work here, and that's probably because we haven't released much information. Our handling of issues in game is anything but arbitrary. I am not however saying that we never make mistakes from time to time. With an organization that has over 200K customers in a high-maintenance environment, there are bound to be cases where we do the wrong thing. These of course are the issues people read about, since upset people post more than happy ones. We just need to be quick about recognizing and correcting the mistakes that we make.<P> I would agree that if our organization was as you thought, then it would be seriously flawed. However, the organization is actually just as you propose, so you could say that we are in complete agreement. <P>-Gordon</i></UL>

Gordon explained what last night's downtime was for on the Gameplay Board today:<br><UL><i>Last night's emergency patch brought in the changes to the damage tables that are mentioned in the patch message and on this board in association with the use of two-handed weapons. Unfortunately it evidently wasn't quite ready for primetime, and had the inadvertent affect of lowering max damage for those weapons across the board. <br><br>It's fixed on test and we'll catch it in the next patch, which should be soon. We would have liked to test that change for a while longer prior to it going live, but the problem that required the emergency patch necessitated its promotion.

Gordon has been posting up a storm once again on the Gameplay Board.  Here's what he's said today:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033877.html"><b>Fiery Avenger Proc</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post:  When can we expect a change for the FA proc?<br>Effect: Flame Shock<br>In lavastorm the other day I was resisted by a fire goblin. Level 20 or so creature.]</i><P>Yes, that will happen regardless of your level. Some creatures are immune to certain types of attacks. This would happen whether the Fiery Avenger proc'd a level 4 or a level 44 fire-based spell. The Proc on the Fiery Avenger is balanced.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033875.html"><b>Does Gordon Read the Wishlist?</b></a><br>We read it from time to time, we typically don't reply. By virtue of it being a wishlist, many of the things in there are something that we'd never be able to implement in EQ, so any type of concentrated effort in the forum would yield in telling a lot of people "no" in many cases.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033848.html"><b>Curiosity Questions Answered</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I play a Rogue on Mith Marr. Now I am just curious I see GG spells for all over except the casters home point. Any reason for this?]</i><P> We've tossed this idea around a few times, and think that it would be a pretty neat spell, however it would have the potential to change a few game dynamics. These types of things always put us on edge. We haven't completely ruled it out as a possible future spell, but I wouldn't say that it's something that you should expect either. <P><i>[Quote from original post: I also see casters fling one bind after another in cities, why not make a group bind?]</i><P> That's a pretty good idea. We'll look into it. <P><i>[Quote from original post: The class skill gives a notice when you use the skill. "you are as silent as a cat stalking its prey" while if a hafling druid uses this racial ability there is nothing showing if he succeded. Same with hide.]</i><P> Only rogues get success/failure messages with hide and sneak. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Also with direction sence for dwarves, does the skill go up after you hit a certain level? It starts at average but can it ever go higher seeing as its a racial ability? ]</i><P>It will start going up after you surpass the level-restricted cap associated with the skill.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033840.html"><b>New Bard Spell</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Now the new Bard charm (Bravura) costs mana. How much mana?]</i><P> The new song is quite a bit more powerful than the old one. I think that once people get a chance to play with it for a while they'll agree. It is powerful enough that we didn't want people to be able to cast it in perpetuity. That's why mana was added to it.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033843.html"><b>Where do we report broken quests to?</b></a><br>The actual email address that should be used is <a href="mailto:eqtesting@verant.com">eqtesting@verant.com</a>. That goes to the test team and they keep a close eye on it. I should stress that this email address is not for hints, and they are generally unable to respond to the email sent there. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033828.html"><b>NPCs and Their Native Languages</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why does everything capable of speech in Norrath speak common? Wouldn't it make more sense for NPCs in their home town to be speaking their own language?]</i><P> This is something that we'd like to do sometime. Given some other outstanding issues though, it's a bit low on the list.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033719.html"><b>Damage Rates</b></a><br>I was apprehensive to announce the change due to the complaints that might come from it. Just to be clear, damage done by 1H weapons have been correct all of this time. Damage done by 2H weapons was not. Here's a complete explanation of the problem: <P>Due to the problem, a 10/20 weapon was superior to a 20/40 weapon, even though they both have the same ratio. The reason for this is a damage scalar that is added to each contact at higher levels is added to the faster weapons more than it is added to a slower weapon, because they have the chance to contact more. <P>(note: These numbers are arbitrary) <P>For instance, suppose that the minimum damage that someone can do with the weapon in their primary hand is 11 points. This represents a 1 point hit, plus a 10 point scalar. That extra 10 points is added to every hit you make, regardless what weapon you use. <P>So, given two weapons have the same ratio, they should average the same amount of damage in a given time. However, since the faster weapon (based upon the stats above) swings twice as fast, it gets that extra damage more often. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033729.html"><b>Bracer Graphics Bug</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: When wearing 2 bracers, both with different display graphics, You see the graphic of the left bracer, and others see the graphic of the right bracer.]</i><P>I've sent this to the test team to put on the list. I'm pretty sure that it's there already but it never hurts to be sure :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033812.html"><b>Solving Linkdead</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The server knows immediatly when we go linkdead, isn't there anything else that could be done so we don't die due to circumstances out of our control? ]</i><P>Actually the server doesn't know immediatly, because you are for all intents and purposes linkdead between each packet that is sent between the client and the server. After a few seconds pass where expected packets aren't being received, the server then marks you as linkdead. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Throw on the invunerable flag, but wipe us from all hate lists so this can't be used as a "Super Tank" exploit in dungeons.]</i><P> We can't create a situation that encourages people to go linkdead by somehow reducing the risk associated with an event. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033653.html"><b>Potion Issues</a></b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Now I am not saying make everything incredibly cheap, but at least lower the prices to a more reasonable level. I would understand if a SOW potion cost 4pp to make, that way they could sell for 5pp, make a profit and everyones happy]</i><P>I'll look into seeing if we can get the costs associated with alchemy looked in to after issues with the expansion are cleared up. I do think that some of the costs are a bit high, but I wouldn't expect them to get so cheap that it replaces the need for a class in your group. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033689.html"><b>What time on the 24th will Kunark officially open?</b></a><br>It's too early to nail down a specific time for certain, however I think we'll probably aim for early in the morning during off-peak hours.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033642.html"><b>PvP Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: It is unfortunate, I think, that the two new servers were both blue. We'll have to see if there was enough would-be migrants to support two completely new servers exactly like the servers they migrated from. It would have been nice, I think, if one server had been designated PvP with qualifications]</i><P> There really aren't enough people subscribing to PvP play at the moment to justify putting up more PvP servers. <P><i>[Quote from original post: In particular, I think a coin-only loot PvP teams servers would have been particularly enticing for those blue server players who have been scared away from PvP by the small percentage of annoying people on the 1 item loot Zeks.]</i><P> Tallon Zek is coin only now, and soon we hope to allow people to move between Tallon and VAllon to determine what is the preferred loot arrangement for the servers. I'm also going to look into a slash-command to hopefully allow us to do some server-specific polling on some issues.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033514-4.html"><b>Station Names</b></a><br>Before this issue gets out of hand I'd like to clear it up. We have no intention of policing station names to the level of character names, because as many people mentioned so few see them. I would however like to refer everyone to the Station community policies that make it clear that the transmission of vulgar content to station servers is against policy and will result in an account being deactivated. <P>As for the people who were banned as a result of a vulgar station name, we are working with them now to get them set up on accounts with acceptable names. A few things were done out of order which resulted in the accounts being deactivated prior to other arrangements being set up. We've handled that problem internally. <P>The reason why this is being enforced is that people do have the ability to post on this board as well as other Station operated boards with the station name that they create, hence we don't want people subjected to vulgar names. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033510.html"><b>Ruins of Kunark Shipping & EQ'ilzer Article</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The GM informed him that Verant would be staggering shipments of Kunark. He told him that they were worried about the initial burst of players to Kunark and that as a result they would be limiting the amount of copies of the game initially.]</i><P> This is completely false and I'll go so far as to say that this didn't happen. It is so far removed from the truth that I'm not willing to accept that anyone employed by Verant could have made a statement to this effect. I would caution everyone reading this to take note when someone speaks of information obtained by "a friend" and provided by an unnamed GM. Let's face it, nearly everyone logs anything told to them by a GM in game, and has no problem naming names in public when they feel that a real injustice has been committed. <P>The articles assertion that we somehow purposely engineered the admittedly unacceptable problems with shipping is unfathomable. We have measures in place on our side (including some impressive new code that has been in for over a month now) that should reduce or eliminate any concerns over zone-crashes due to over-population. <P>Now that that is out of the way, there are several posts here on the board by John Smedley that give the most up-to-date information that we have in regards to the shipping issues. We are committed to doing right by our cusotmers in this matter, and hope that you'll hang in there while we get everything sorted out. Running EverQuest has been an unending stream of "firsts" in the gaming world, and we'll learn from these issues as well.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032701.html"><b>Solusek Goblin Faction Change</b></a><br>I'm investigating this issue, here's where I am now: <P>The Faction guy says that the goblins should have been KOS to everyone all along. However, no one made a specific change in regards to that zone or faction. My best guess at the moment is that another bug was fixed someplace else that may have had the effect of clearing up a few faction issues, but I'm still investigating.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033048.html"><b>The Neverending Game</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: This game will never end and never will. I see n0 satifaction in a neverending game. I dont have the time to play Everquest for the rest of my life. I enjoy playing a game, finish it, and then go on to the newest and greatest game. A never ending game is sucking the life out of us.]</i><P> Well I thank you for your honesty Kevin. It is true that games of this nature (ones that aren't designed to be beaten) are not enjoyed by some people. We understand this and don't at all hold people at fault for feeling this way. <P>Thankfully for the sake of our company, there are also people out there who enjoy the game just for this reason. We've built Verant around the philosophy of creating massively-multiplayer games. I would suggest that you take a look at Sovereign. Though the game as a whole isn't "beatable" per se, the individual "games" that you join with the main game are finite and have definite victory conditions, which would allow you to win the battle for world domination, finish the game, then join another. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033311.html"><b>Any chance of lich stacking with clarity?</b></a><br>Allowing these two lines of spells to stack would result in necromancers regaining mana at a much higher rate than we want people regaining it under any circumstance. Though the point is disagreed with by many, multiplayer games of this nature have a pace, and this suggestion would change it dramatically for one class.</UL>

The object of the event is this: The Faydwer side will storm Neriak, <br>where the opposing races will be grouped, ready to defend their alliance. <br>The Faydwer side shall attempt to invade the warriors guild, and slay two <br>guildmasters.

Gordon Wrinn made several more posts late last night on the Gameplay Board.  Here's a roundup of them:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033409.html"><b>Utility Spells</b></a><br>There are more utility spells out there then Enduring Breath and levitate, and though they are indeed utility spells, they aren't of the same line. <P>Utility spells are any spells that are not combat related. Examples of this, while including EB and Levitate, also include Shrink, most of the mages non-pet summons (even if the result of the summoned item is an attack/defense spell), and a good portion of the enchanter spells (such as metal enchantments, alliance, etc). There are many others as well, including travel spells which would also fall under this definition. <P>Off the top of my head, I don't believe that clerics get either of those spells. I might be wrong about that though. <P>It's not an oversight, it's by design.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033439.html"><b>Freeport Woes</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I'm soooo sick of lamers with no ability to fight for themselves going up in the walls of Freeport and nuking the bejesus out of every thing that moves. Been trained at least 6 times that way, including 3 today.]</i><P> We made some pathing changes to Freeport that was supposed to fix a couple areas where people were doing this. <P>If you have a zone name and a /loc of where they are doing it now, I'll forward it to the guy who can fix it. <P>A dragon might be a little extreme though :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033445.html"><b>Dragons</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The problem with this is that patches are normally completed during the same 4 hour period every time, so the Dragons only spawn during this same 4 hour period every time. This makes it impossible for the people that cannot play during that 4 hour block to ever join in a Dragon raid. A possible solution to that problem is to make the Dragons spawn randomly, maybe every 4 to 8 days]</i><P> I'd be willing to argue a random component on initial dragon spawn after a server outage to the tuning team. I'd also be interested in hearing arguments pro and con over the next week.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033558.html"><b>Is it possible to make weapons with more than one spell effect procs? </b></a><br>No. The way our item database works only allows us to assign one spell to an item. You can however use a weapon that procs in conjunction with a spell that makes you proc (Vampiric Embrace comes to mind). They just can't both go off in the same round.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033588.html"><b>BetaNeutral Faction Problems</b></a><br>BetaNeutral is the standard faction that is applied to NPCs that we want to remain available to everyone, regardless what they do. It is generally only applied to merchants that need to like (or at least not hate) everyone, the PoDs, etc. It generally isn't applied to anything that people tend to kill in a normal day on EQ. <P>Chances are that the BetaNeutral NPC you found in Befallen was set that way by mistake, which sometimes happens. We have added ways to the game to increase the betaneutral faction to handle these specific cases.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033424.html"><b>Iksar Names</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: As it says in the OFTEN IGNORED patch message, you can't start an Iksar, but trying to do so will put that name on a 'taken' list which prevents you or any other user from using that name. Now, here's the problem: you and I both know that there's tons of idiots out there who will go ahead and slam that "next" button and ruin a bunch of perfectly good Iksar names!]</i><P> We're a bit worried about this as well, and are usually apprehensive about announcing issues that allow things such as this. However we were faced with the certainty that many people would try to create Iksar with their preferred name, only to have it forever blocked. <i>[Quote from original post: Fight back! Reserve your Iksar name now! Go start a spare character - not an Iksar - with the name you want and after the doors of the expansion opens you can delete that character and then start one with that name.]</i><P> This is a good plan; I'd recommend it.</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon made the following post regarding the possibilities of a roleplaying-only server on the Gameplay Board.  Here's his post:<UL><b><i>pagane, Though your design has merit, the purpose of my question wasn't to redesign the race/class/deity system in EverQuest, but rather to hear someone define "roleplaying" in a universally accepted and enforceable manner, in response to all of the posts stating that we should put up a "Roleplaying Server". The first reply to your post states: <P></b></i>-A server with the label "Roleplay ONLY"<P>-Make it enforced somehow (if its not enforced or somehow different, then its the same as the others, or will eventually be so) <P><b><i>This pretty well illustrates the biggest problem surrounding the prospects of a "Roleplay Only" server, the suggestion that we enforce it "somehow". Unfortunately "somehow" requires a definition unless people playing on it were willing to be completely subjected to the individual personal and unguided judgement of our customer service staff. Other examples of this same issue are illustrated in the Play Nice Policies. <P>Take the naming policy as an example. It is clearly posted on this website and covers the majority of situations that can come up. Nonetheless, there is still a component of judgement, and people take offense and post their feelings on the board when that judgement is used. <P></b></i>Maybe not "enforce" it persay, but make it less attractive to a powergamer, KeWl d00D, etc... <b><i><P>The problem here is that things that are attractive to the powergamer aren't necessarily repugnant to the roleplayer. Furthermore, the "powergamer" isn't necessarily the antithesis of the roleplayer. <P>One of the frequent suggestions that we see in regards to creating a "Roleplay" server is that we eliminate /shout, /ooc, and /auction. Some go as far as to say that we should also eliminate /tell. How can limiting the number of ways people communicate drive off the powergamer while attracting the roleplayer? Whenever a new server comes up, it is frequently bombarded by players who wish to play "race to 50". I'm not saying that there is necessarily anything wrong with this playstyle, but how would a server with crippled communication keep the stereotypical "solo powergaming druid" from coming to the server? <P>Another frequent suggestion is that we should limit the amout of time that someone can be logged into the server per week. Though the number varies, the majority of people I've seen suggest this suggest between 10 and 20 hours per week. I received a note from a Paladin the other day who identified himself as a "diehard roleplayer". He commented that he absolutely refuses to go out of character while playing. He hadn't yet reached level-50 (several levels under actually), and had nearly 100 days played on the character. Is this person not a roleplayer because he has so much free time to play? I know a druid who is in the mid-30s with over 70 days played, and I'd have the same question about her. <P>I've seen other suggestions as well, all with their merits and their flaws. Some people define "roleplay" as unrestricted PvP. Some people suggest that we create servers where the vast majority of items are nodrop, others suggest we create one where nodrop and lore tags are removed. <P>With all of the suggestions I've seen (and don't get me wrong, I like a number of them in general, even if not for the purpose of creating a roleplay server), the majority appear to point to making the game more difficult. Making the game more difficult does not do anything to scare off the type of people that you would like to be relieved of. It tends to attract them. <P>I think that it is important for people to remember that the choice to roleplay is a personal one, and everyone makes and implements that choice in their own way. I believe what everyone wants here is not to have to deal with people that they think are "jerks", and that by creating a roleplaying server we can somehow filter out all of the "jerks" from joining. It is a fantastic idea, but really impossible in implementation. <P>These are all reasons why our stance is that we cannot do a &#8220;Dedicated Hardcore Roleplaying Server&#8221;. It can neither be satisfactorily defined, and therefore couldn&#8217;t be enforced. That said, if someone were to design a roleplaying server, with minimal changes required in code, where everything (including enforcement procedures) was defined , and if you could get 3-5K people to state that they&#8217;d play on it, we would take serious note. By all means if someone out there has a fantastic design for such a thing, we&#8217;d be very interested in hearing about it. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

I dont know if this is completely true from reading other posts but this is honestly what I heard. = )        <P>                        Deqor Lilwolfe of the Azure Guard<br>                                    Veeshan server   </BLOCKQUOTE>I've received a couple of these reports saying the same thing, and while we haven't yet heard from Verant it seems to be legitimate.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Hot off the pages of the Gameplay Board, here is the latest round of Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033401.html"><b>FA Can Bash, then why can't SoSU also?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: However, I think that the Shield of the Slain Unicorn (currently a Piercing weapon, with some AC) would be a perfect candidate for recieving the BASH upgrade. This change would be a tremendous help to small and medium-sized warriors, for whom SLAM is not an option ]</i><P>Well you do have a point. However the shield is technically a weapon with some AC that just happens to use a shield model. We don't have the capability to label an item as a shield AND a weapon, so the ability to bash was never included on this item. Concerning the change made for the Fiery Avenger, that's really a hardcode, and as Brad stated earlier, only FA-style (Epic quest super weapons) would gain an ability of that nature.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033404.html"><b>Loading.....Please Wait</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post:Two patches ago I noticed that loading time has increased significantly.  PC is 800mz, 384mg rams, SCSI HD 10krpm, defraged, scandisked daily. And I defrag EVERYTIME after downloading the patch data, that is EVERYTIME. Now, zone times were 29-32 sec before (yes I have a stop watch, why don't you?), they are 58-126 sec now]</i><P> Hmmm, this sounds pretty strange. There's really nothing that we've done on this side that could account for doubling-to-tripling your load times, in fact we've made changes that should have reduced them for most people. I would suggest that you look into a possible hardware or software configuration problem with your PC, and also check with your ISP to see if they've been having any problems. One of the nice things about running a game with 200K players, 50K+ of them being on at the same time, it's easy to spot when problems of this type are caused by something on our end, as it's never just a small number of people affected. Also, you didn't mention how big your hard drive was, so you might consider checking it to insure you've still got some free space. That's about all I can recommend at the moment.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033374.html"><b>/guildalliance - Is it possible?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post:We had several postings about uberguilds that control the servers. I.E. Dragon- and Plainraids.]</i><P> One of the main difficulties in taking down the dragons or doing the planes is in keeping everyone organized. Certainly this becomes easier if everyone involved is part of the same guild, but in most cases you have people from a number of different guilds (including the unguilded). <P>Though I don't think that this ability can be expected in the foreseeable future, we certainly appreciate all of the good suggestions that people make.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033381.html"><b>Tinkering Doomed?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: This latest patch just made the mages 1-charge water breathing stones non-lore. I already had a heck of a time selling my aqualungs/rebreathers. Now any 50 lev can walk into unrest and offer 20pp for a backpack full of stones to any 20th level mage.]</i><P> This really shouldn't be a problem. Sure, they might be non-lore, but they are summoned so they will disappear on log out or on a lost connection. Something that does unlimited enduring breath is superior to the stones. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033389.html"><b>Kunark Access</b></a><br>Just to clarify, the ability to access Kunark is assigned on a per-account basis, not on a per-installation basis. This means that each account has to be either created with the ability to access Kunark natively (like accounts with the new boxed set, the one with the Iksar on the front), or has to be upgraded to access Kunark. <P>A new accounts ability to access Kunark is dependent on when you bought your box. Any boxes from the original run will create an account incapable of accessing Kunark without upgrade. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033349.html"><b>Inventory Bug</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Lately I have been seeing a problem when looting with a semi-full inventory. If my inventory slots are all full, but I have some stackable items that are less than 20, and I loot another of those items, it will no longer allow me to right click those items directly into my inventory. I can left click and individually pick up the item and drop it on the stack ]</i><P>Yes this is a bug and we are aware of the issue. It is on our list but I don't have an ETA for a fix at this time.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033225.html"><b>Possible Virus</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: It seems that every time i try to play eq, i have to download the eqgame.ex_. or is this normal now? it is quite annoying because of my slow modem--it takes 10 minutes to get the game started. OR have there been patches everyday?]</i><P> If your eqgame.exe is downloading every day, my money would be on a virus here as well. We did patch eqgame.exe today, and last Tuesday as well, but not in between then. I suggest you go find some good anti-virus software.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033274.html"><b>Shields in the Back Slot</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Another question: Why can't all shields be utilized in this manner?]</i><P> The ability to wear something in more than one character slot is a benefit that could be applied to an item on an item-by-item basis. We probably won't be updating existing items retroactively in this manner. <P>Also, there are some shields in the game that we *really* wouldn't want people wearing as cloaks. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033328.html"><b>The Steel of Norrath</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: If you watch the highly experienced adventures of this land you rarely see anyone choosing this form of combat. Even the holy and the shadow knights how can only equip one smaller weapon choose to use the one handed slashing weapon favor of the bigger twohander.]</i><P> There is a statistical problem with the min-damage calculation used for all weapons. Basically, it made low damage low delay weapons of a given ratio much more preferrable than a high damage-high delay weapon. We're going to look into enhancing the amount of damage done with 2H weapons versus 1H weapons.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033345.html"><b>Corpse Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: When I recovered my corpse I realised that the entire contents of one bag were missing! As far as I can remember the contents were only the bottle from the Temple of Marr and 17 muffins. The items are easy to recover but I'd like to know if this is a function of the game or a bug?]</i><P> NPCs do not have the ability to "steal" items from you or your corpse. Though I'm not sure what may have happened in this case, it's probably not by design. Is it possible that you might have had these items in a summoned bag that disappeared upon a linkdead or a logout, and that you mistook another empty non-summoned bag for the bag that stuff was in? That's probably one of the more common things that we see.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033209.html"><b>Enchanter Nerf</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: So WHY after many many months of this stacking it is suddenly removed? I mean there is going to be a spell that gives both later in enchanter new expansion spells life, so why NERF us now.??? granted why do i need both, well its my mana and I like both buffs, since I am an intellegence based casters I recieve no cheating buff or anything, so WHY . Please explain this?]</i><P>It's our opinion that each spell granting the same primary stat that it used to, plus a lesser value of the secondary stat is an enhancement. It actually gives enchanters a way to buff INT prior to them being able to before. <P>It's not about game balance, so I suppose if enough people want it to go back the other way we'll seriously consider it.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033224.html"><b>Server Split Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Would it be possible for split servers (preferably the two coming up soon) to be set up as "international priority" servers. ie. Log the movelog commands during european/asian/australian primetime. (no actual preference for those who are not international), but letting it be known that the future downtime for this server would take place, during off-hours for international customers, without upsetting the north american customers.]</i><P> "International" is a big place. One of the problems in running a global game is that inevitably, you take down the server during someone's prime playing time. The only way that we can even attempt some semblance of fairness is to pursue our goal of inconveniencing the smallest number of people possible. <P>Since the purpose of the split-servers is to spread out our primetime usage, we'll most likely continue to log interest during that time. However there's nothing to keep international people from banding together and choosing a particular server on their own. If the peak hours of a particular server were to shift to 7-9am PST instead of 7-9pm PST, we would definitely look into the possibility of shifting our schedule.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033157.html"><b>Snare Resists Increased? </b></a><br>We haven't made any global or specific changes to the way resists work in a *long* time, except to lower their possibility via code. An example of this would be how wizard's spells are resisted less after they hit level 35. <P>Specific NPCs on the other hand are adjusted frequently, and not to mention have a chance of being boosted dynamically if the NPC makes a good roll. It sounds like the second part is what happened in your case.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033159.html"><b>Hybrid Mana Penalty</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: That's right, hybrids get a mana penalty on their spells, they only get a small number of spells, and they get spells so late they are often too weak to be of much use. What was Verant thinking here?]</i><P> The thought was that a hybrid should never be as good at casting a spell as the parent class. It's fairly sound. Just because they have the spell and can cast it doesn't mean that they should be an expert at it. Another example, just because a druid can wield a scimitar doesn't mean he'll be as good with it as a ranger. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033160.html"><b>Kunark Items</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: About 4 days ago I was in a party in Sol B, doing the Efreeti Djarn. I was listening to players in the room talk that I had never met before and their topic of discussion was the soon to be released Kunark. They were talking about how they are going to Kunark as soon as it comes up to get all the nice items its sure to have... thier urgency was for one reason only... they figured that Verant would make mistakes (as usual) and put in some items that were sure to be removed once the players but them to good use. They wanted these items before they were removed (Much like the Manastones and Rubicite of past days).]</i><P> One thing to keep in mind is that we certainly don't enter into situations where we have to do this knowingly. It's a decision that's made after we've had time to evaluate items/skills/spells etc., and have discovered some detrimental affect to gameplay or the pace of the game. So I can't promise you that it won't happen. <P>However... Most of the items we've had to change or replace post-production were created when EQ was relatively new. At that time we were still learning the way that different things could be used to an advantage beyond what was intended. After running EQ for over a year now, we have a much better idea about how all of this works, and as such situations such as these should be much more infrequent than they were before. <P>The only other thing we have to worry about is typos. Hopefully we can catch any typos soon enough that replacing the existing items retroactively won't be taken as a "nerf".<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033171.html"><b>Charges Bug</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Okay this has been bothering me for a long time. Stiens of mo**** say 3 charges healing when you first get them, yet my enchanter is now holding a stien with 1 charge and I haven't used them. No I didnt' accidently trigger it either, my druid has an observers staff when he first got it it had like 20 charges or somthing of sentinal, and now it has one and no I didn't accidently use it either. So what gives with these charges? Is it a bug?]</i><P> It appears that there is a bug somewhere. My play character happens to have a Stein of Moggok that has a phantom charge. I'll ask the test team to take a look.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033156.html"><b>Augment Death</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: In the last patch Necromancer spell Augment Death was changed to last 3 times as long for twice the mana. A great addition thanks! My question is why was Intensify Death not changed by the same factors.]</i><P> It's a lower level spell. We decided to leave the earlier one as is in order to make the upgrade mean more. Now Augment Death is better in another way :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032795.html"><b>The Death of Faction?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: With the recent upgrades in various zones, namely Lair of the Infected Paw and Kerra Isle, we have witnessed a disturbing trend which eclipses the benefits of fighting and exploring from a faction stand-point: namely, fighting in Paw will no longer earn you positive faction with Qeynos, and fighting in Kerra Isle will no longer improve faction standings with Erudin's High Guard, High Council and other groups.]</i><P> I'll ask around about this and get back to the thread tomorrow. Everyone involved in this aspect of design is out for the day, so I'm not sure if it's by design. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033129.html"><b>Social Buttons</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Have tags. For example "/em slaps <target> with his gauntlet." might result in "Galleth slaps Wolvarin with his gauntlet." or "Galleth slaps a reanimated hand with his gauntlet.". It would allow for some neat role-playing hotkeys, for use even during combat.]</i><P> We've thought about doing something like this for a while. It's a good idea, and we'd like to do it at some point, but it's one of those things that is always low priority in the grand scheme of things. <P>As for your other ideas, they are good as well, albeit a little bit harder to implement. I'll check around on the first suggestion though.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032167-2.html"><b>Are there any steps being taken to give rangers a skill of thier own?</b></a><br>This question has been around a few times in a couple of different threads, so I thought I'd answer here. We currently have no plans to create a unique ranger-specific ability/skill. We believe that rangers are essentially well-balanced, useful to groups as a lightly armored melee machine with some useful spells thrown in. <P>Giving you some equivalent to HT/LoH isn't going to swing balance wildly, so it wouldn't alleviate all of the concerns of other rangers that post on this board, so there'd be no reason to do it except for the purpose of "throwing you a bone", which we don't do. <P>We know that it is not possible for us to make everyone happy with their class, which is why we recommend that people choose a class that they can be happy with. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032875.html"><b>Bash Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Keeping it short, non magic shields cannot bash magic even if you have magic shoulders. Since magic shoulders allow large races to bash magic with a non-magic weapon in their offhand, shouldn't magic shoulders allow non-magic shields to bash magic as well? I consider this a bug, the 'magic shoulders' rule should apply to all items in the offhand, including nonmagical shields.]</i><P> This isn't a bug. The Bash skill requires a magic shield. The Slam skill requires magic shoulders. Hitting a magic creature with the weapon in your off-hand requires a magic weapon. Bash essentially turns your shield into a weapon, which is why it requires a magic shield. You are hitting them with your shield. <P>Slam, though it looks like you are slapping them with your fist is more akin to checking them, hockey style. When you have a shield equipped, the slam is considered a bash. It's one of the tradeoffs that exists in the game. You cannot have all of the advantages of having a shield and all of the advantages of not having a shield at the same time, unless the shield is magic.</UL>

The article begins with the following:<UL><i>Recently, I have started a new character and have come across a disturbing trend amongst new players - They have no respect for unwritten rules.

The blokes at GameSpot UK have kicked up two huge EverQuest features.  The first is a superb <a href="http://www.gamespot.co.uk/news/2000/04/6565.html">interview with Verant CEO John Smedley</a>.  In it he talks Kunark, EQ's future and more!  Also included with the interview are three really interesting pictures from a gathering (people are in-costume) at the Bastille!  Here is a couple of excerpts:<UL><b>GameSpot UK: When are you going to tackle PvP?<P></b>Smedley: After Kunark it's going to get pretty dangerous. We're turning the dial every time we make a change - not always the right way. We've got to live and learn. EverQuest is still about PvE, but PvP is going to be much more stressed in future products.<P><b>GameSpot UK: Richard Garriot has been quoted as saying that all his forthcoming games will use "an Ebay model" - allowing players to earn a real-life living in a game world. Will you ever change your current anti-Ebay policy?<P></b>Smedley: There are two reasons we don't like the auction and selling idea. The first and largest reason is fraud. There is a lot of fraud - people making multiple sales of a character and not delivering. People are being prosecuted and we get stuck in the middle.</UL>Also new on GameSpot UK is several brand new Kunark screenshots.  <a href="http://www.gamespot.co.uk/pc.gamespot/rpg/ruins_uk/galleryshot1.html">Click here</a> to jump to the new shots.  Both are great reads (and views) so be sure to check them out!

Here's today's round of the Gordon Infobits, a compilation of excerpts and quotes from recent postings by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032551.html"><b>EverQuest Soundtrack</b></a><br>I believe that all of the songs in EQ also play on the website at www.everquest.com :)  I'm not sure if the music would make for an entire soundtrack. Maybe if someone expanded on the existing works :) <b>(Note from Aurum: We have two zips containing EverQuest's music in our <a href="/files">Files</a> section)</b><P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032953.html"><b>Hasten Still Bugged?</b></a><br>I'll have the test team check this out. Is this only on Brell? Or other servers as well? Is he getting stuck somewhere, or does he keep zipping around? <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032973.html"><b>South Karana Test Server Issues</b></a><br>I'm sure SK has a much lower population on the test server, and they might have gotten some good rolls when you've been there. This could contribute to the observations. <P>However, just to be sure I've forwarded the post to the Test and Live teams to doublecheck. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033042.html"><b>Enviromental Effects: Can an Iksar survice in EverFrost?</b></a><br>Environmental effects from cold are something that wasn't put into the game. If we were to do something like this, we might have to make it so that Trolls can't go to Lavastorm or something of that nature. This is one of those times that realism takes a back seat in the interest of gameplay, like when we let full plate wearing encumbered clerics swim.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033095.html"><b>Fear Vs. Hate</b></a><br>Interestingly enough, we got the impression over the past several weeks that people found the drop rates in Fear to be acceptable, and hate unacceptable. Prior to that, the general feeling was that drops in Fear were bad, but Hate was great. At that time, we adjusted both of them in opposite directions. This time however, last patch fixed Hate, but didn't change Fear. <P>I'm starting to think that the problem at this point might be coming from the standpoint that "equality between the planes" hasn't been acheived. <P>The truth is that both planes are now engineered to drop the same amount of armor (on average) in the same period of time. They are basically equal now with possible exception to a surplus of cleric armor that might be dropping in Hate due to public reports.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033040.html"><b>Dungeons and Kerra Isle</b></a><br>The dungeons are designed with the idea that there will be several groups all "doing" them at the same time. In your example, the idea would be that some other group should have cleared out the area behind you by the time you need to run. Of course then you train and kill them, so you might have a point :)  Let's give it some time however, we are committed to having people use this and some of the other underutilized dungeons. If we need to make further changes to make that happen, we will.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033130.html"><b>Symbol of Naltron bugged?</b></a><br>Well it's designed so that if you want the best thing on you, it's going to cost enough that you'd consider it "expensive". Looking at the lineup you've posted, and remembering it from my leatherskin days, it looks like Jasper may actually be underpriced, but I don't think we'll be changing it at this point. <P>One good piece of news, the next in the line of Symbol's will use the same reagent and last longer.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033128.html"><b>Who's the Tank:  Ranger or Cleric?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The Cleric class is suppose to be a plate armor class, and the Ranger is a chainmail class. And from my understanding plate armor is suppose to be superior to chainmail. That and I'm all for my healer to have more AC.]</I><P>This is correct, and that was the motive behind our changes. Now we realize that there are pieces of armor that the ranger can wear that use the plate texture, but that is *really* chain-based, and was set to use the plate texture since it looked better. <P>There needs to be an advantage to being a plate class, and that's why the cleric armor was boosted to bring it in line with the hybrids.</UL>

Gordon announced what changes were in today's patch on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the info:<br><UL><i>Today's patch primarily contained preparations for Kunark, including some new art. There was also a bug that was fixed with a bard song that was put in last Tuesday. The song (a charm upgrade) was not capped. Someone was kind enough to send us a screenshot of someone with a *really nice* pet named Cazic-Thule.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>
