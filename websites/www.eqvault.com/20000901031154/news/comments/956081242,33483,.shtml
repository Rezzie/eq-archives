That mentality will get you nowhere. Newbies should respect the effort it took to get the camp under control, not to butt in or petition, but to ask to be in a rotation.

You dont know me so I feel that asking for a private teleport via /tells is assumming too much. One that I will do it and 2 that I want to hear about how you died here and you HAVE to get back to your body because you forgot to bind. Ive heard every story already, twice :/ <br><br>however, when I hear people asking for a ride over a common /ooc channel I will more likely teleport them. Why? Because they are not bothreing every wizard/druid in the zone with a /tell, going down the list... They are understanding to not bother everyone and to try their luck with a pulic shout. Granted I agree that half of the teleport shouts are ridiculous &quot;In greaterfay: Need teleports to commons&quot;... thats why theres a boat... but when you /tell me to teleport you I'll probably not do it unless I know you.<br><br>Also, i offer another common curtesy. Pay your teleporter!! Thats right- it takes a LOT of time to teleport you (waiting for you to get there, teleporting, then waiting for the mana to come back, over and over...) just offer to pay EVERY TIME. And if you offerred to pay in the beginning, for heavenes sakes don't forget to when you get there! Countless times Ive had people offer me a donation and when we get to the final destination they say &quot;bye&quot; and run off... no donation, no thanks, nothing... Its annoying at the least and insulting at the most.<br><br>Ok I'm done ranting :) To all my fellow teleporters out there, have faith- one day you will find a good ride *grin*<br><br>-Tala Praeclara, E'ci<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I have a slightly different view on things however.<br>I started playing in March 99, with a wizard, and as such (with most of the older players as well, i suspect), it took me forever to even realize that i could get a teleport, or a SoW, or a buff. I watch the younger players now however, and realize that they have these opportunities for such things, that i don't even think they should have. What do you need a ride for at Level 5? You're 5!!! GO EXPLORE!!! Find your way across the lands, learn what is where, interact with others along the way, and kill a few mobs. Maybe then there wouldn't even be the need for these &quot;Unspoken Rules&quot; You learn them along the way, as you group, travel, interact... whatever. <br>The biggest part of this game, and it's true intention wasn't camping, it was to explore, to have fun, to discover new lands. When you're 20, and have seen everything, and been everywhere you can, then... then you have no real need to waste hours traveling from Perma to GFay. <br><br>Just my two cents. Live, experience, learn....<!--ktalk end_comment-->

God how annoying.<br><br>Quite simply people are ingrates when they get TPd, usually do not pay unless you demand it in advance, and once TPd get addicted to it if you will, and demand it in the future.  Hell most the time they don't even thank you, and can't even type out the word &quot;please&quot;.<br><br>Quite simply, go /anon, and ignore them.  I'm sooo frickin tired of getting a tell from some newbie demanding a TP to qeynos or some shit like that, offering to pay me a whole 3pp and personally attacking me when I don't take em.<br><br>So after level after level, I just say to hell with em.  Walk more newB?<br><br>I still give people SoW... and never accept money, but only if they ask nicely with the word &quot;please&quot; (not &quot;PLZ&quot;), or offer to pay.<br><br>&quot;DOOD TP ME TO QEYNOS NOW PLZ!!!11!!

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Tsedek Vanya end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->All in all, these rules are great.  There are a few things I would add to the list:<br><br>A minor pet peeve of mine is when I don't have /anon or /roleplay on, and someone asks me what class I am.  It would have been easier for them to type '/ Tse' then '/say What class RU?' and save me the trouble of explaining.  This isn't as much of a problem among those who have played for a couple of months however, since they figure out a class's 'look' and can identify you by appearance.<br><br>Take the time to learn what the different classes can or cannot do.  Asking a cleric for SoW is a common violation of this rule of etiquette.  Another is forgetting or refusing to /assist the main attacker when your enchanter is mezzing a group of NPC's.  Learn how to play with the various classes and take advantage of their strengths, and you will find yourself dying less and annoying fewer people.<br><br>Along the lines of Tala's comment, if someone gives you a service offer to pay!  This goes for buffs, binds, GG's, SoW, rezzes, clarity, and anything else where someone is going out of their way to help you.  Many times, especially if a high level character is casting a low level spell for you, you will find the character refusing your payment.  But he or she will appreciate the offer, and will be more likely to help you in the future.<br><br>If someone is attacking an NPC, do NOT do anything to it unless they ask for help or are obviously about to die.  The only possible exception to this rule is if they are stealing your spawn.  It doesn't matter whether you just take one swing at the NPC and miss, your attacking an NPC that is 'taken' is very rude.<br><br>Well, I could go on for a while but I guess I'll do everyone a favor and stop now =)  I hope these suggestions are helpful.  Just keep in mind that you aren't the only person that deserves to enjoy the game, and your treatment of others contributes a great deal to how much fun they are having (and how willing they will be to help when you need it).<br><br>Tsedek Vanya<br>Level 35 Cleric of Felwithe (Hooray!

IE, gnolls at the spires in SK. There's no breaking that spawn. It just sits there, you call it, kill it, repeat. No special effort, yet people think they 'own' them as if they worked hard walking there from the nearest teleport point....<br><br>Bah, hogwash!<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

I get them all the time as I RP.  People see that I'm a druid and assume I can tp.  I can't as I'm only L23.  When I correct them, I often get a really pissy attitude.  Sorry I'm not a power gamer and only average about 12-15 hours a week playing since November.  I agree with some spawn ownership if it was a tough one to break, but I see the same attitude at Icy's and other places, which are not that tough to break.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I've had a lot more luck with my &quot;/ooc Anyone teleporting to xx? :)&quot; than private tells. I always offer to donate, even to close friends... there's only 1 or 2 on the server (and I know a lot! :) ) who I'm close enough to to expect free teleports, and only then when they're not busy.<br><br>On the person who was complaining about level 5's looking for TP's... well, I've had characters lower level than that who DID need them desperately, usually 'cause they were doing a mule errand for me (with 3 major characters I find I'm transferring things a lot). Sometimes I need that mule to be TP'ed from Faydark to North Karana to get my necro that bag full of bone chips. :)<br><br>Players, traditionally, HAVE owned a camp. The new PNP has changed that. Most importantly, be courteous! If you say &quot;FU I wuz here 1st!&quot; expect to be KS'ed from. If you offer a reasonable comprimise, expect to make a friend. But it's not a rule that a player owns a camp anymore. It's too crowded, and there just aren't enough spawns to follow this rule anymore.<br><br>As for the twink/anti-twink debate, this isn't the place for it. I twink. I'm sure that if I didn't a large number of LORE quest items would have rotted on corpses. Sure, I could have sold the (for instance) crafted BP I made, or I could have let the talon rot on the corpse, or I could have found a warrior in zone who needed it and let them train my group trying to get it... point is, once you get to 35+ this stuff practically drops in your lap. I didn't deprive anyone, except someone who had 1500pp to blow on a crafted BP, and there will be more. :)<br><br>Otherwise, all solid. An addition I'd consider:<br><br>It's considered good etiquette to ask before checking someone's equipment. I don't spaz over it, but it's just courteous.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

It seems that common courtesy is in our real society a contradiction in terms, and all these &quot;unwrittens&quot; are is a list of simple, courteous behaviours.  No..nobody owns a spawn. But once I break a tough one, I really don't appreciate someone coming in and pulling the spot after I've done all the work alone.  So, I also won't do that to someone else.. it's mutual respect.  I expect of you what I expect of myself.  I don't like the &quot;typing shortcuts&quot; of &quot;u&quot; &quot;plz&quot; &quot;lvl&quot; etc... if you want to communicate with me, do so, in clear and complete sentences.  If you speak another language.. great..time for me to learn something new.. &lt;smile&gt; Ich sprache Deutche.  Mehr? Consequently, if I feel I really need assistance, I will /ooc &quot;is there any gentle who might be able to spare a Spirit of the Wolf for a donation?&quot;...done WHILE I'M RUNNING TO MY DESTINATION.  I do not expect someone to come to my aid, but may look for assistance on the way. <br><br>The simple point is this..this list is not a &quot;DO THIS&quot; list, it is a group of hints of certain behaviors that many, if not most, of the players will find favorable and will most likely garner favorable reactions.  When it comes time for me to need to group and take down that pompous, self-absorbed Dragon Naggy, I will want help..and if I have &quot;grown up&quot; building a reputation as someone who is polite and fair.. the odds of me getting what *I* want go up immeasurably.  So, kindly don't look at this as a dictat of how one *must* behave..it's a list of hints on courtesy as it is observed within Norrath.  The Karmic Kredit Plan is an unforgiving one.. but it works well. <br><br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

Heck you didn't even leave EQ Name, email or even the server you play on.<br>  I do agree that doing an OOC/Shout is the way to go, that way the other is never placed in a bad position.<br>  Macbhaird, Ungoliant is simply saying that people should not shun twinked characters, because generally a twinked char is played by a more experienced player.<br>  Now to Ungoliant some of the things you posted I disagree with, for example, if Shaman had never complained that Alchemy was not working Verant would never have known and it would not be working to this day.  Similiarly there is a reason for &quot;nerfs&quot;.  An example is of course Necromancer pets, they could trounce any tank of the same level, as well as beat the Master Summoner's best pets.  Which was of course a mistake, just like the feighing death and sleeping letting pets get them exp.<br><br>Luthair Paendrag<br>Champions of Divinity<br>Tunare<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

The only real unwritten rules are things that the vast majority of players can agree on, things like don't killsteal and don't train crap on people minding their own business.  It seems the whole point of this editorial is to minimize complaining &amp; I don't think that's the most important thing.  And the editorial contradicts itself at the end, telling people life isn't fair &amp; suck it up; so if life isn't fair &amp; some people just like to complain, why don't you just suck it up when people complain and/or tell you their &quot;I need a TP/rez/sow because I was bound half-a-world away&quot; story for the umpteenth time, instead of trying to sway people into thinking that those who complain/whine/lament are public enemy #1?<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email kenoshi@hotmail.com end_email start_name Kenoshi of Povar end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Regarding rule #1<br><br>That's not true. A lot of people are anonymous because they are roleplaying. I've received plenty of services from anonymous individuals (granted that I ask nicely and offer to pay) and they were all happy to oblige, a lot of which even refused to accept payment for their services because they felt accepting payment for helping others is wrong. I do agree with the author's assessment that some people do hound others, but then again, those being hounded could always keep an active ignore list.<br><br>Regarding rule #3<br><br>This is a &quot;play nice&quot; rule and certainly doesn't take into account of roleplaying. What if the group that was camping that spawn were composed of good races, and the new group are bunch of evils that are roleplaying their characters? Should they play nice and not try and overrun the camp? I think not. This is especially true on the PK servers, where the two parties would most likely engage in mortal combat and fight for the camp.<br><br>Regarding rule #5<br><br>The author needs to understand that the way deity/faction/race/class statuses are dealt with in EverQuest are seriously FUBAR. There are a lot of people that complain because of legitimate reasons. For example, having merchants that KOS you just because you chose to play say a Necro makes absolutely no sense: how in the world would ANYONE know what class you are just by looking at you? Are all necros walking with the word &quot;Necromancer&quot; stamped in the middle of their forehead? How in the world does say a paladin in Freeport, thousands of miles away from Odus, know what class a robe-wearin' Erudite is just by looking at him/her? Was there a global announcement of sorts that every NPC hears when you are born into the world? Racial hatred is fine, but factions being affected by what you do for a living? That makes no sense and doesn't promote good roleplaying at all.<br><br>Regarding rule #6<br><br>Twinks are unbalancing. The author needs to read Brad's comments on twinking and zone mob economy. The author states that &quot;A self-twinked player most likely knows a lot more tactics than a non-twinked player of the same level, and can put them to use by making a fight go more efficently.&quot; Th author is correct in that respect, but then why in the world would such experienced players need to twink themselves in the first place if they are more adept at tactics? The author needs to realize that the majority of the players aren't powergamers, and that there are a lot of people out there that loves the character building and roleplaying aspects of the game. Watching some level 1 character walking around with &quot;super death sword of the heavens&quot;, stacked from head to toe with a set of &quot;impenetrable armor of the demon-king&quot; , owning the zone leaving you with little to no opportunity to gain experience is really, really, annoying.<br><br>Regarding rule #8<br><br>The author should tell that to the people that just finished some of the plane quests. Yeah, you went through all that trouble for pathetic equipment, you shouldn't complain, suck it up! Sure, life isn't fair, but that doesn't mean you have to take all the BS that comes with it, you actively try to do something about it. In regards to classes, I agree that the classes shouldn't all be &quot;equal&quot; and should be even more unique compared to how its handled now, but at least each class should live up to the general populace's expectations. Remember, people who complain are the ones that makes a lot of problems known to people at Verant. <br><br>The problem with nerfing isn't about players complaining, its a problem where Verant needs to know that downgrading capabilities only works in extreme cases. For example, when wizards and magicians cry about druids, shamans, and necro's abilities to &quot;kite&quot;, Verant needs to look at WHY wizards and magicians are complaining: wizards complain because they're only marginally better at damage output, and magicians complain because they can't kite. In this case, wizards have a legitimate complaint and Verant should work on improving that class. Magician are complaining about something they were never meant to do, kiting, and should be ignored.<br><br>In conclusion, although the author made several valid points in regards to etiquette, a majority of his &quot;rules&quot; only applies to powergamers. These rules have absolutely no regards for roleplaying. Keep in mind that EQ is an MMORPG, not everyone plays it like a mindless 3D first person shooter.<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

Further the auther posts &quot;EverQuest Ettiquite and Unwritten Rules&quot; as a title.<br><br>Note the part about rules? There is an assumption that this is the mindset and way things are, when it isn't.<br><br>My point on twinking is that a character being twinked ONLY shows that it's a character that is twinked. NOTHING else. Twinked characters do not mean that the items were earned by another character belonging to that player, nor do they mean that they were not. It just means somebody has twinked equipment. Doesn't mean they are a good player, or that they didn't buy the equipment from ebay.com. It doesn't mean they are a bad player either.<br><br>The author holds up the twink like some kind of kindly, benevolent fount of knowledge and being twinked doesn't mean anything close to that.<br><br>As for spawn owning, I notice everyone went on their own rants after mine on it, as to how it's always been that way. Did any of the ranters bother to read what I said about it? NO ONE should own a spawn that doesn't require breaking. That's just being greedy.<br><br>As for how it has been, I still think that needs to be changed. Why should my group have to go on lists and be broken up just because we want to spend an hour fixing our froglok faction in lguk? Why can't someone SHARE a spawn?<br><br>Bah! What nonsense!<!--ktalk end_comment-->

First off, the only valid rules are 3 - 5.<br><br>Rule 1: On Rallos Zek, &lt;b&gt;EVERYONE&lt;/b&gt; over level 5 is /anon or /roleplay. Why? Because there are obviously class/race combos which can cream another combo at the same level (mostly any caster vs a melee; only an exceptional melee can whip a mediocre caster). It is just a common safety measure, you NEVER want anyone to know your class or level. Never. Thus, it's not in the least unpolite to ask someone for a buff, etc. within reason. I play a Halfing Rogue. Guess how many times a day I get asked for SoW or a heal? Of course that's what bandages are for...<br><br>Rule 2: See Rule 1<br><br>Rule 3: Well considering this is a PvP server, if someone won't share the spawn you can always kill'em. Rude, but, well, effectvie :p<br><br>Rule 4: Agreed<br><br>Rule 5: Agreed. I of course would not be doing this, because then PKs (Player Killers) may decide I am easy prey. Not too common, but again, a safety measure. I bet everyone here locks there doors at night; ever had your house broken into? If you left them unlocked, would your house been broken into every single night?<br><br>Rule 6: Twinking. Ahh, a very delicate subject on PvP. Firstly, a twinker has an edge over a non-twink. Thus, many players (including myself) feel that they have an unfair and 'illegal' advantage. Adds a new dimension to it, eh? On the other hand, you may just be able to snag yourself some nice equipment... Which then in turn could be looted from you... (I will say that twinking is extremely rare on Rallos Zek. It is pretty much suicide at very low levels.) At least an equilibrium is obtained with levels and equipment. Unfortunately, many of us are still wearing cloth or pathcwork into the upper teens.<br><br>Rule 7: Well I partly agree with this. However, safety in numbers means a heck of a lot more on PvP. For instance, would you ever walk down a dark alley at midnight? Well it wouldn't exactly be a problem if nobody could hurt you (ie blue server).<br><br>Rule 8: No no no, you want every little scarp of edge you can put on your character on Rallos Zek. Poison was basically our (Rogues) only viable option for PvP. Now it's nerfed and you guys won't hear the end of it until it gets fixed. For good reason too, I think. Same as any Fearing class, I'd expect the same when they got dear removed from PvP situations (and charm by the way; oh, and another rogue skill, Instill Doubt).<br><br>On a blue server, all of these ideas sound fantastic for the most part. But this is really rahter useless on my red server. I hope I have shared my side. Don't think that everyone on here is a blood-sucking homicidal maniac. I have met a lot of great people, who wouldn't harm a hair on anyone's head.<br><br>Kambic the Rogue<br>Rallos Zek<br><br><br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email lightwar@mindspring.com end_email start_name Lightwarrior end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Okay, I've got a couple things to say.  First off, I haven't played as long as a lot of you.  I don't have any Lv. 50s - hell, I don't have any Lv. 20s.  But I have played on a wide range of servers and wide range of race/class/diety combinations.<br><br>Secondly, I want to say that the &quot;d00dsp34k&quot; really pisses me off.  What's so hard about typing &quot;are&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;please&quot;, and &quot;you&quot;?  I never do anything for these people.  I usually respond with &quot;What a strange dialect of &lt;language&gt; you speak...&quot; and turn away.  If they rephrase using English (Spanish, French) I'll consider it.<br><br>Nearly last, I want to say something about twinking.  I find twinking to be incredibly distasteful.  I understand that you have a 30-something Druid who can get whatever you want, but it takes something away from the game when you give yourself these types of advantages.  What fun is pencil-and-paper RPGs when you've got a characters with perfect stats?  Eventually, the novelty wears off - there's nothing to shoot for except more XP, more Levels.  I speak from experience.  The one character I attempted to twink turned out horribly - I lost interest and haven't played him since.  Moreso, you ruin the game for people around you.  Like Kenoshi said, watching some hyper-twink own a zone leaving you no experience really sucks.  Personally, I treat each character as an individual, unique from my others.  If one of them wants something another one has, they better damn well pay for it!<br><br>Finally, I have a few things to say about race/class/diety relations.  A while back, someone was complaining about how MOBs know what diety you worship.  Gordon (or someone) said that it is assumed the characters wear some symbol of their loyalty - like (some) Christians and Crosses.  The same, I would belive, goes for Class.  A necromancer is going to distinguishable from a warrior; a ranger will look different than a shaman.  True, not every individual openly displays their affiliation.  But hard hats generally say construction worker, suits businessmen, and carpel tunnel syndrome software engineers ;)<br><br>Sayomaen, 19 Wood Elf Warrior, Fennin Ro<br>Krenoad, 18 Troll Warrior, Povar<br>Vogel, 16 Wood Elf Druid, Povar<br>Gharm, 12 Dark Elf Necromancer, Vallon Zek<br>Jorganthalas, 11 Wood Elf Ranger, Povar<br>Igjarjuk, 11 Troll Warrior, Rallos Zek<br>Gbuku, 10 Troll Shadow Knight, Rallos Zek<br>Kylistani, 10 Barbarian Shaman, Rallos Zek<br>...and a horde of others.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Brannil end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Well,  that editorial was one sided opinion at best.  Some of the things I will agree with, but most of it was pure babble.   First off, let me make it clear that I dont want to flame Ungoliant for putting in his two cents worth...  there is nothing wrong with showing an opinion...  so here's mine.<br>The item on his list of complaints about people who complain too much, is this...<br><br>&quot;* If a player or group is at a small spawn or camp, and has obviously been<br>there a while, it is an unwritten rule that they own that spawn. They most<br>likely have spent enourmous efforts (and possibly lives) to set the spawn at<br>the camp, and they deserve to keep it. One may think that they have a fair<br>share there too, but this is not the case. You put no effort in helping<br>split or set the spawn, why should you reap the benefits? Any high level<br>player can tell you this.&quot;<br><br>I'm sorry...  but Verant's WRITTEN rule is going to have to overwrite you UNwritten rule in this case.  Everquest was meant to be fun for EVERYONE.  From the people who can sit for hours waiting for a camped spawn to open up to those of us that have to work all day and only play for 1 or 2 hours a night.  nobody has the &quot;rights&quot; to hold a spawn and not share it.   I'll pull another quote from verants page...<br><br>&quot;Contested Spawns<br><br>There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same thing. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a binding compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise mandated by an EQCSR will be considered disruption. It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.<br>Note: A &quot;group&quot; in this case is defined as a party of one or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are capable of completing that goal.&quot;<br><br>Topic closed.<br>Second...  <br><br>&quot;* It is good practice to read what is /auction'ed or /ooc'ed. It is just<br>troublesome (and downright rude and annoying) to ask &quot;How much?&quot; for<br>something that was clearly stated as being bought. The same holds for /ooc<br>or /shout conversations. If you don't know what you are talking about, don't<br>say anything. Doing so only makes you look bad.&quot;<br><br>Some people might have missed an auctioned message stating an item was sold,  perhaps you should have thought about your last two sentences before writing the editorial.   Each person playing EQ is doing so in THEIR own way, to have fun playing, just as you do.  Just because you follow these &quot;Unwritten rules&quot; as a way of playing and having fun, doesnt mean the other 2200 other people playing on Karana with you play the same way.  It's a big world,  you'll need to learn to share it.  This statement goes for most of the other points in the editorial too.<br><br>And Finally....<br><br>&quot;* And finally, and most importantly, LIFE ISN'T FAIR! ... &quot;<br><br>Correctamundo!  it isnt.  and if people dont play up to you unwritten rules...<br><br>&quot;don't complain, just suck it up, deal with it, and adapt.&quot;<br><br>And dont write editorials complaining about people who complain too much.<br><br><br>Thank you.<br>Brannil Stormbow<br>Karana<br><br>P.S.  sorry for the long winded post.<br><br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

EXCEPT the suggestion to newbies to /tell people with requests for sow/buff/teleports.  TUNARE HELP ME!!  As a 50 druid, I avoid Kelethin and Rivervale like the plague, because of the newbie beggars that are so common there.  I always read shouts and OOCs, and if i am teleporting, I usually will offer free rides, or contact those saying they wish to go.  But send me a private tell, and you wont go anywhere with me.  Same goes for sow and buffs, you pretty much will get ignored.  Dont beg from me, go earn your way as I did.  I am proud of the time I've invested getting all the way to where I am, and dont feel I should have to hide from lvl 1 people under the anon tag.  I doubt there is a druid or wizzie out there who wants private tells from all the beggars.  And if there is, please give me their name, I want to refer all the tells I get to THEM.  =)<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Maybe after u get to high lvl's and twink ur own character urself i see it as ok, i know most of u wont agree but its my opinion.  many of u say a twink will run around &quot;owning&quot; the zone stealing all exp<br>this is tru probably in lvl 1 - 5 but in levels after that you have to group and the only ppl who can solo r the classes that can still solo untwinked, such as druids, twinked they just have a large advantage.<br><br>no for the DoOdSPe@k ppl they are annoying when they type like that, but if u type like me abbreviating most words (you=u , people=ppl) this is because we r trying to talk to ppl by typing, some of us cant type like others so to speed things up so ppl dont think im constantly going afk i abbreviate<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Of course you did'nt care.  You were just trying to learn the game, just like all the other newbies are doing right now.  It's very hard to learn the basics when &quot;unwritten rules&quot; are being thrown at you!  It seems to me that you wrote these rules, so what does that make them?  They are only &quot;unwritten&quot; if nobody writes them.  Do you expect everyone in the game to know everything that you know about it.  And maybe you do know EVERYTHING there is to know about the game.  Everyone else doesn't and probably doesn't care to either.  Just my little chip in to the thread.  I mainly just wrote this cause everyone else was getting off subject.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

No real effort to break the spawn. If your group can take the spawns as the happen, you can break it no problem. Easily Shared. IF on the other hand say you are doing Ice Giants in side Perma at the road to Vox, you have had to fight your way into the room, hold the room while pulling Giants and Nox. A lot a of work, along comes the 'others' they want to 'share' the Giants but didn't have to do anything special to get there. Where were they when you broke and held the room, where were they went things went sour and invis dropped on the way in, now they demand half the reward for getting to this point, Loot/Exp whatever.<br><br> Also! People, mostly those who like KS'ing have come up with this fantasy called free for all MOBs. Well there is no such thing. Now it is called what it always was, Kill Stealing.

On a new server, EVERYONE knows who EVERYONE is and respects the effort it takes in a camp. when your in 3spawn in sol b, you know that you get the champ / priest / king. Not 3 seperate groups camping each. Yet when your in lake rathe at lower levels, people always want to move in on your kills. Granted this is because there are far more lower lvls, but even as you get to high lvls, you are put on a 'waiting list' and not just 'put into the rotation'<br><br>Anyway, my 2 cp, which isn't much consernint im a dorf =]<br><br>Demius Abernathy<br>Cowboy Cleric of The Nameless<!--ktalk end_comment-->

And it's cool to make people happy when you're one of these old ones.<br><br>Just try to help newbies in a newbie zone...it's so rewarding and fun, because you have been like them, weak and underequiped.<br>You can break a spawn for them, you can buff or heal them, you can finish the monsters...<br>Of course it's not the same thing if they beg you until death or if they don't thank you ;P<br>But in most case they'll thank you heartly and remember you later.<br><br>That's not the same for twinked players. for me, twinking is just like playing a game with cheat codes, and that's worst in a RPG. Just because you have a lot more satisfaction earning your equipment with your own power, just because you are waiting for your next level for being stronger.<br><br>Sometimes you receive gifts, and that's really cool. but people who say that the twinked player worked to earn his full plate armor make me smile. The lvl 50 character got the money or the items, and at this level that wasn't really hard, and gave them to the young one (well you all know what's a twink ;P).<br>fighting without risks only results in an unglorious victory.<br><br>but that said, they are 'asses' in old and young players. the young ones will become the old ones of the next generation.<br><br>I've met tons of cool low to high levels, and tons of stupid low to high levels... <br>to conclude: it's not a matter of level of character nor a matter of 'time played'...it's just a matter of player's behaviour and personnality. you don't have more rights if you are a older player nor a younger. <br>Respect each other and it should work fine. It's not because some players are really dorks that all the players of this level or this class or this 'age' are the same.<br><br>Grok!<br><br><br>Mengochmendroat Piegochpiedroat &lt;Les Korrigans&gt;<br><br>&quot;/dance with me to have a sow&quot;<br><br>Ogre Shaman<br>Mithaniel Marr<br><br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email Macbhaird@hotmail.com end_email start_name Macbhaird end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Hey Sensi Jadeleaf, I didn't bring it up, the twink advocate who did the stupid editorial did.<br><br>Being okay with twinking is NOT an unwritten rule. The very existence of the threads that you mention explains that very well. But I'm specifically stating that he is saying that a twinked player is a benefit to the group in terms of knowledge, and I disagree. I'm not going into a whole twinking line, such as how some people don't want their game to be less challenging just because they are grouped with a twink following some stupid unwritten rules that should have never been posted (which is the same thing as he's saying). The problem is these are presented as fact (rules) and not opinion.<br><br>So tell the writer of the editorial NOT me!<br><br>In addition to the lame thing about tainking, and spawn ownership, the sending a tell to high levels for buffs, teleports etc. is SO WRONG. there are druids running anon in our guild because they want to avoid those very same tells.<br><br>If you want a tele you should be doing it in /ooc or even /auction (if you are going to pay for it).<br><br>Nothing makes a high level druid madder than:<br><br>joebob tells you, &quot;can I get a tele to steamfont&quot;<br>you tell joebob, &quot;I can't I'm in a group and we are going to Permafrost&quot;<br>joebob tells you, &quot;C'mon, they can wait on you, I'll pay you&quot;<br><br>That's the way almost ALL tele request in tell run.<br><br>To recap:<br><br>* Do NOT hound any player for anything, including buffs. Ask if you need to, accept the no if that is what is given and be polite.<br><br>* When needing a special server, use the /ooc and /auction (if you are going to pay). do NOT send tells to unanon players. Some of the unanons don't want to be forced to hide from their guilds because of unwanted tells. Chances are if no one responds then they are occupied. Be patient and realize if you asking for a tele or sow, it's probably better to start your journey and continue to /ooc or /auction along the way. And of course /say ask those you pass if they are not occupied.<br><br>* If a player or group is at a spawn point that they had to work at to take over (Derv camp for example) it is courtesy to NOT ask to share. HOWEVER if it is so crowded that you need to have such a place, it is also courtesy to ASK instead of taking. If you have taken over such a camp, it is courtesy to OFFER to share, and if it is a spawn that requires NO work (such as SK gnoll points at spires), then it is courtesy to NOT expect to be asked, as you didn't work for it in the first place.<br><br>* It is good to /auction a PRICE with what you are selling along with any stats, that saves the other players from having to ask anything of that nature. <br><br>* It is good to understand that all race/class/deity/faction standpoints have a place in the game, and that being not as good is a result of grass greener syndrome, because as soon as you stand on the otherside, you'll miss what you had before. Everyone has a place, by working together you'll enjoy the fact that this is a balanced game based on Player vs Environment and is oriented towards grouping.<br><br>* Twinks are as Brad McQuaid put it &quot;a necessary evil&quot; for the purposes of extending playabililty (IE, twinks play longer, therefore pay longer). Understand that SOME people dislike twinking and don't WANT their game challenge lessened. Understand SOME people enjoy twinking, both for the lessening of difficulty and the k3wl look. Both are valid in current EQ, but they are not necesarily compatible, let the otherside placy as they wish, DO NOT expect special treatment one way or the other because you do or do not twink.<br><br>* If a player doesn't want to group, he doesn't want to group! Some players function well solo, others are antisocial and do not like to group. Still others just want some time alone. If they say no, don't complain...just find somebody else.<br><br>* Life isn't fair, but games are supposed to be! If you find that you have issues with the game is going, use the OUT OF GAME message boards to communicate to and learn from others who may agree or disagree, but in game DO NOT whine and moan as most people are trying to have fun.<br><br>Finally, this all may seem less harsh than that drivel for unwritten rules, but the reality is the game is a social and game and issues and actions should always result from courtesy and consideration, it just isn't reasonable to assume that anyone is going to play by anyone ELSE's ideas of RULES. These things I've shared are just some thoughts that may make YOUR journey through Norrath a little less bumpy :)<!--ktalk end_comment-->

After all if I wrote a report at work and someone took it off my desk and handed it in and claimed the credit I think I would be mad too :o) .<br><br>If an annoying newbie begs tell him to go away, if he asks nice and is polite do your best.  I expect nothing from you lot and I hope you expect nothing from me, if its possible to help out I will and I hope thats the attitude most people have.  If I want a SOW Ill shout once maybe twice and not in quick sucession, if I get no takers Ill run to wherever I need to go cause at the end of the day all the time its taken you to stand around and shout you could have been halfway there.<br><br>As for shortening words, well it dont hurt and I am not the fastest of typers in the world, though EQ has made me a bit quicker ;o), sometimes to get my point across quickly and have a conversation at a reasonable pace I need to abbreviate, its not k3wl its easier.  If someone roleplays with me I wont do it but you may have to wait a little longer for the reply ;o)<br><br>I reckon all the etiqutte you need is a treat others as you wish to be treated, thats how I'll live on EQ and its worked so far.  <br><br>Dariarn, Officer and official Enchanter of the Tuatha de Sgalain - Cazic Thule<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Virtutis end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->The issue of spawn &quot;ownership&quot; has troubled me for some time.  The only (I am pleased to say) time I have ever engaged in a real dust-up with another player occured one time I was camping the lower level com/elite/shaman room in the 'burrow.  My pattern was simple: mow the lawn then wait for the high spawn to pop.  Well, this individual -- who I should still very much like grind to pulp -- came in just seconds after the spawn, pulled an elite, and ran it all the way to the elite ledge (this, for the 6 of you who do not know, is quite the circuitous hike).  There he and his buddy (who, it should be noticed was MUCH more reasonable) beat on it while waiting for their own spawns.  I was flabbergasted.  I have shared spawns with dozens of people, if only they asked.  I have encouraged lower level players to clear out lower level spawns (and offered them buffs and protection) while I waited for higher spawns.  I truly felt I was owed a simple measure of courtesy.<br><br>That said, I have never felt I &quot;owned&quot; a spawn and, in fact, have always felt obligated to share.  I like the &quot;play nice&quot; rules (begging the question that they're enforced equitably) and would only note, as others here have, that the proposed &quot;unwritten rules&quot; contravene them.  We shall, I think, always have knobs among us.  Perhaps we should note that the glass is half full and reflect on how many people it has been our pleasure to game with and make free use of &quot;/ignore&quot; for the balance.<br><br>Virtutis Gasconard<br>Paladin Knower of the 12th Virtue<br>Servant of Rodcet Nife<br>Prexus <br><br>  <!--ktalk end_comment-->

If I'm killing low blues in a party of 5 and someone asks to join, I let them - no sense in making excuses about XP and making them suffer because of the overcrowding.  If another group wants to share I let them.  If someone asks me politely for a buff I give it to them.  If a Lvl 2 in freeport demands a free TP to GFay, I drop them off in lavastorm and TP out.  If a lvl 6 in full crafted or even full bronze continually ninja loots, I drop him from the party and ignore (What do they need silver pieces for anyway when I have 3 pieces of cloth to my name?).  If people took just a moment to consider how the other party feels before jumping to a conclusion, there wouldn't be so many problems.  Both usually have legitimate concerns and it's a shame most people are too immature to work things out.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I don't like to go anon.  I like showing my class, so if someone has an enchanter related question or really needs an enchanter (for metal enchanter for cleric quests for instance) they can ask me.  What I don't need is some level 5 who's completely across the zone asking me for a clarity.  When that happens to much, roleplay switch goes on.  The proper ways to ask for favors are A: shout for it or B: if you are next to the person, /tell them or do a /say... if you do a /say, put in who you are addressing.<br><br>On camp sharing, etc... for those that say Verant has written the rules:<br>Verant also wrote that killstealing was legal for the longest time.  High level players shunned killstealers, pretty much to the point that a habitual killstealer couldn't play at high levels because no group would have him.  Verant can write and say what they want.  And we'll remember you.  We won't group with you, we won't ress you, SoW you, trade with you.  We will feel free to share anything you are camping, of course.  And in the end, you will be forced to retire your useless and unfun character.  Killstealing was legal, now its illegal.  So instead of killstealers, we have Camp Poachers.  Same thing, really.  So we'll use the same treatment.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

If you are camping in a room, it is your room.  Everything you aren't camped in isn't yours and is pretty much a free pull.  I know some people on newer services believe that priest, champ, and king are 1 camp... simply not true... the priest is 1 room, you camp it.  If you can pull the other two because nobody is there, more power to you.  But hogging multiple rooms just isn't nice.<br><br>Anyway, asking to share a camp or join in a rotation is normal in lower levels and permission usually given.  At higher levels (25+), it simply isn't done.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Any more than this level 5 is better than this level 5 because one is wearing rawhide and the other is wearing patchwork, or any more than this level 50 bard being better than this other level 50 bard 'cause he has plane armour and dragon weapons and the other is in bronze armour and carrying a PGT. That's just common sense, all the equipment in the world makes no difference if you can't play your class well.<br><br>I'll tell you why -I- twink... because I hate auctioning. I despise it. Totally. :) I take no pleasure in the trade aspect of EQ, and in fact dread it. That's just the way it works for me... I don't like selling. I also camped, or was given as gifts from friends (which isn't twinking, despite what some people think IMO) every piece of equipment I have - not only do I rarely sell stuff, I rarely buy it.<br><br>Twinking infringes on the rights and enjoyment of others when twinks become priorities. When your level 50 character is depriving level 30 people of equipment they deserve to camp because he decided he wanted to outfit his level 1 xx in level 30 equipment by tomorrow afternoon.<br><br>Futhermore, I don't roll for items for twinks. Sure, my level 22 rogue would have loved that SBD we picked up, but I sure as hell am NOT going to roll against the level 30 rogue who was in the party for my low-level. The only exception to this is in large, dynamic, changing groups (king's room in Sol B for instance) where upon entering the group I'm told we're ALL rolling for all rare loot.<br><br>And yet another twink debate fizzles out, thankfully. I've just grown tired of hearing about it... I used to despise it, but now I recognize it as part of the game. I get crap I don't know what to do with and me and my friends can't make use of, so it's twinked instead of sold, because I hate selling. If anyone finds evil in that... *shrug*<!--ktalk end_comment-->
