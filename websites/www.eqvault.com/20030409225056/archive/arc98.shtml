Yes, the servers are definitely down.  Rob sent me the following report which helps shed some light on the reason why:<BLOCKQUOTE>FYI:<br><br>The servers are back down because the drop tables were broken.  They<br>were taken down about five minutes after I /petitioned this in game, but<br>others probably did as well so I doubt the servers being down is my<br>fault alone.  A giant skeleton in Rathe Mountains dropped both Tarskuk's<br>charm and a black headband (which you normally have to kill a Qeynos<br>guildmaster to get).  Who knows what else was misdropped all over<br>Norrath in the hour between when the servers were patched and when they<br>were taken down.<br><br>Still, unlike test, it's a virtual certainty they won't be wiping items<br>or characters on the production servers, so whoever got good stuff ought<br>to just consider themselves lucky.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for your report, Rob.

A new Patch Message is up on the EverQuest Patch Server.  Here it is:<UL><b>July 19th, 7:00am</b><br>-----------------<br> <br>***Patch Day***<br> <br><b>*Miscellaneous Changes/Fixes*</b><br> <br>- The "Safe Points" have been moved in Field of Bone and Lake of Ill Omen to someplace "safer".<br>- You can no longer cast invisibility on any pet.  <br>- Foul language issued through /emote will now be handled by the profanity filter.<br>- Corrected a bug that allowed linkdead players to walk through locked doors.<br>- Rangers above level 50 will now do double damage with Archery against non-moving, non-rooted targets.  These restrictions allowed us to enhance archery without creating a new kiting problem.<br>- Corrected a bug that had rangers doing less melee damage than was intended except when fighting an NPC who was also a ranger.<br>- Pets, both PC and NPC, will no longer cast "Gate".<br>- A large rat says, "Hit by non-melee for XXX damage", is history.  The new message given probably isn't the source of never-ending humor that the old one was.<br>- Updated pathing information in Innothule Swamp.<br>- Corrected many, many, MANY spelling and grammar errors in the world.  <br>- Fixed a large number of spell gems and spellbook icons.  Take care to take a look at your spell lineup to familiarize yourself with the new gems/icons.<br> <br><b>*Poison*</b><br> <br>- Implemented the high level Rogue poisons (level 51+).<br>- Increased Rogue "Make Poison" skill cap.<br>- Substantially reduced chance to fail "Apply Poison".<br>- Rogues will now automatically sit when right-clicking on a poison.<br>- Failure to make a poison will now return the vial.<br> <br><b>*General Crafts*</b><br> <br>- The Ant's Potion may now be used anywhere.<br>- The small and large reinforced wristband may now be crafted.<br>- The small and medium studded shoulderpads, cloak, and belt may now be crafted.<br>- The medium reinforced mask may now be crafted.<br>- Sealed Poison Vials can now be crafted.<br>- The Thermal Cloak may now be tinkered.<br>- The "This item is trivial..." message in craft skills has been replaced with "You can no longer advance in skill from making this item".  <br> <br><b>*Items*</b><br> <br>- The Elven Paladin Newbie Tunic may now be worn by Half Elf paladins.<br>- The Murky Vial will now properly affect the target instead of the player.<br>- Increased stats on many Plane of Sky items.<br>- There was evidently more than one "Fine Steel Dagger" running around in the world.  Some of them have been renamed "Serpant's Tooth".<br>- The effect on the Staff of Undead Legions has been changed to something a bit more useful.<br>- The Deepwater Helm now has a significant casting time.  The function of its spell allowed a mana-free heal even though it was intended to be a buff.<br> <br><br><b>*/consent*</b><br> <br>Some people were spamming others with /consent, causing them to disconnect. As a result, /consent can now only be done once every two seconds.  Should you be harassed via this tool, please use /report.  Also, please take care to avoid accidentally /consenting someone, as it will be two seconds before you can undo it.<br> <br><b>*Cazic-Thule and the Feerrott*</b><br> <br>There has been a significant change to the factions in the Feerrott and Cazic-Thule.  Take care not to get killed by NPCs that previously left you alone.  The significant upside to this change is that the "Cazic Gate/Portal" can be made much safer in nature for those who work on their faction.<br> <br><b>*Regen Effects*</b><br> <br>This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type spells (e.g. Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite DOT spells.  As a result of this fix, players can no longer accept a regeneration spell while under the effect of a DOT.  However, if the regen spell is already in place, the DOT will stack, but not replace the regen spell.  This will allow users of beneficial DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue using their DOT while under the affect of regen.<br> <br><b>*Keyed Dungeons*</b><br> <br>The key for Charasis (Howling Stones) is now NODROP per the patch message from a couple of weeks ago.  Furthermore, when your character dies, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Veeshan's Peak, will no longer remain with your corpse, but will instead return with your character to its bind point.  We made this change to reduce the difficulty and corpse-loss potential of these zones, and eliminate the need to do the key quests multiple times.<br> <br><b>*Barbed Scale Whip*</b><br> <br>In the last item patch, this item was changed from its original stats to something inferior, as the game designer was not aware that it was already in-game.  It has been changed back to its original stats.<br> <br><b>*Hiding Corpses*</b><br> <br>A new command has been implemented in the EverQuest client.  This command (/hidecorpses) allows players to suppress the display of player and NPC corpses on the screen.  This can be very useful once you've entered a zone with a large number of corpes, causing framerate to decay.  It will be particularly useful in the planes.  The command supports the following arguments:<br> <br>- ALL: Hides all corpses except yours.<br>- ALLBUTGROUP: Hides all corpses except yours and those of people in your group.<br>- NONE: No longer hides corpses.<br> <br>For community reasons, this option must be set after entering each zone, and will not affect corpses made after you enter the zone.  You can reset it while in the zone in order to suppress display of corpses made since you originally set it. <br> <br><b>*Resurrection*</b><br> <br>The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the person casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting.  Furthermore, experience will not be "removed" from your corpse until you accept the resurrection by choosing YES.  Previously, any resurrection spell, if declined, would cause the experience to be unrecoverable.<br> <br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Blammo!

A bug was brought to the attention of Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board last night.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062484.html">original post followed by Gordon's response</a>:<UL>Abashi..can you explain why the Deepwater Helm for Paladins with the effect Daring can be cast repeatedly and continuosly gives a hit point increase? Meaning, a paladin basically uses this effect on the helm for a continuous, mana free healing on himself and others. I personally watched a paladin effectively out heal a cleric using this helmet. <br><br>HOW IS THIS NOT CLASS UNBALANCING? No this is not item envy, or class envy..I am a 41 cleric, but other classes have no qualms about speaking up when their abilities are infringed upon, and this situation is reminiscent of the Treant Fists pre-nerf. Why is the effect on this (and prob other armor) able to be cast continuously and nonstop with additional HPS given from the spell effects basically allowing the user to heal non stop and continuosly? As a 41 cleric I was and am appalled at this scenario..it reminds me of the pre-nerfed Treant Fists, when monks were continuosly casting heals. Is this going to be addressed or not? Why cant you make the effect self-only and make it timed? I seriously doubt your intent was to have the items used in this fashion, but damn it....don't you test any of these things before you ut them in the game? If it isn't going to be changed then I think clerics should have the terror forged mask reinstated with the call of bones effect. That effect for the mask is no more game unbalancing than this helm and other "effect armor" :P<br><br>Jachra Bindwounder<br>41 Cleric of Innoruuk<br><br><b><i>Actually it is. So much so that tomorrow's patch will put a substantial casting-time on the effect.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Upon receiving a claim of item loss due to a bug, the GM will begin the investigation process (checking logs, backups, etc). This usually takes roughly 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The GM will then immediately take action and reimburse the item(s) based upon the outcome of the investigation. <br><br>Our customers diserve courteous and prompt service, and we'll do everything in our power to insure that they receive it.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>Thanks Gordon!

A major announcement was just sent to me by Verant CEO John Smedley stating that the customer service division is going to be overhauled.  Here's the complete letter:<UL><I>Hello All,<br><br>I'd like to announce some pretty big changes for the better to our Customer<br>Service:<br><br>1) We are making a serious revision to our Item Reimbursement Policy. From<br>this point forward, GM's will reimburse items to players that have lost them<br>due to bugs. We've added a lot of logging capabilities, and the policy will<br>be to reimburse the item, and then to verify in the logs that the item was<br>indeed lost. Please be aware, if we catch people lying to us (i.e. a person<br>says that they lost their Magic Item, but they really traded it to someone)<br>we can and WILL ban people on their first offense. We think it's important<br>that we place trust in people, rather than assuming they aren't telling the<br>truth. The downside to this is that we will probably have a lot of people<br>trying to scam us. Be warned - Don't try it.<br><br>2) We're in the process of adding a lot more GM's. In addition, we're adding<br>more GM's during the 7am - 4pm shift to better accomodate our International<br>users. We're also adding a fair amount of Night GM's to assist players off<br>hours.<br><br>3) Our Customer Service phone calls are now completely handled out of the<br>Verant facility here in San Diego. Before it was split between this facility<br>and a Customer Service group out of Utah. In addition, we're adding a lot<br>more phone support staff to better accomodate players.<br><br>4) We've modified our Internal procedures with regards to how our GM's treat<br>players. One of the biggest complaints we've seen is that GM's are rude or<br>short with people. It's important to us that our Customers are treated with<br>respect and appreciation, so we've been working with our GM's to try and<br>make sure that players experiences with GM's are positive ones. In addition,<br>we've been weeding out problem GM's. Please keep in mind, it's not an easy<br>job being a GM and we do ask that players treat the GM's with respect as<br>well. From here on out if you feel like a GM is being rude to you, please<br>email our new Director of Customer Service, George Scotto at<br>gscotto@station.sony.com<br><br>5) We've added separate GM's for Quests and Events. Expect to see a lot more<br>from us in the near future.<br><br>6) We've put a new email system in place that should help ensure quick<br>response.<br><br>7) A different version of the Online Store will be going up soon. It will be<br>web based and people will be able to order Kunark from it once it's up.<br><br><br>Regards,<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</I></UL>Thanks John!

<a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo/">Ask Milo</a> was updated on EverLore recently.  As always Milo tackles several issues dealing with just about everything in life.  Here's a blurb:<UL>Why the hell do you suck so much? Just wandering. You should also give some people your respect because you seem to like to treat people like crap. LATER.<br><br>GP69GP69 <br><br><b><I>I give my respect to people who earn it; furthermore, criticizing someone doesn't mean that I don't respect him/her. To too many people, showing respect means smiling and nodding one's head and perhaps even behaving sycophantically. I don't know what you call respect, but to me, it's just the acknowledgment of worth; I don't see that this comprises acting like a yes-man all the time. Heck, I respect only those people who are both intelligent and secure enough to hear me criticize them, anyway (should I feel the need to do that). I certainly *don't* respect whiners and crybabies, neither will I treat everyone the same, because I like some people more than others. Besides, my power to upset someone is only as strong as the veneration that this person bestows upon me. Why should anyone who doesn't know me well enough to value my opinions care what I have to say about him/her?<br><br>Perhaps, instead of "respect," you should have written "common courtesy," in which case I would have agreed with you that I can be fairly uncivil, sometimes. I'm working on that, but it's not easy, mainly because people tend to be so easily upset that the line between honesty and rudeness becomes fine to the point of being invisible. I have no intention of compromising my candor, so please, be patient with me.</b></i></UL>Thanks Catalyst!

From DDarkmane:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hello,<br><br>My name is DDarkmane, the web master of a new Druid site called The Druid's Circle.  At this time The Druid's Circle is in it's infancy, but I hope that in the near future it will become a place where all who play druids in the game of EverQuest can visit when they need information about our class.<br><br>What prompted the creation of this web site was topic of Druid Quest Armor on the EQ Message Boards.  Some sites touched upon this topic but it seemed that sites dedicated to the class shied away.  I feel that controversial topics of this nature need a place where they can be highlighted and discussed among the players of the class, not lost among the clutter of every class as is evident in the EQ boards.  Those who play druids need a place where their thoughts and needs can be shared and discussed, not buried or dismissed out of hand due to a web masters interest or lack thereof.  I WILL listen, and I WILL let the voices of those who visit my site be heard.  All who enter The Druid's Circle shall stand on even ground and be judged by their peers...  And when the topic is of great interest, when the time comes for all druids to act as one, I want them to know that The Druid's Circle will be there as a rally point.

An interesting observation about the dragons was sent in by Babaderu.  It's not confirmed, but it is interesting speculation:<BLOCKQUOTE>Models of the original Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox are being used on the test server. There is a dragon in the Dreadlands that looks like Lady Vox except named Snowdrift and drops the same loot as Vox has been found. Also in Skyfire there is a dragon that looks like Lord Nagafen and drops his same loot. Could this be Verants answer to the many complaints about the 53+ killing of the dragons?<br> <br> <br>Babaderu Dragonlord<br>Druzzil Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

From JC:<BLOCKQUOTE>I have just placed up a new article by the name of <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/tech/mmrpg2/index.shtml">Livening Up the MMORPG</a>. It basically delves into the possibility of more action in upcoming MMORPG's and why it would be beneficial to the genre. <br>Here's a snippet:<UL><i>"One thing that I've always enjoyed about Team Deathmatch, CTF, or Team Fortress in First Person Shooters was the fact that you were matched up on a team as soon as you logged in. Of course in an MMORPG a player probably wouldn't want to log in to a set dungeon in a set group of people that he may or may not like or that may not be evenly matched. There are however alternatives that could make grouping easier in MMORPG's."</UL></i></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
