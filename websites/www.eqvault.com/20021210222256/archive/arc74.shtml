PC.IGN recently <a href="http://pc.ign.com/news/26697.html">interviewed Verant's Jeff Buttler</a> about their upcoming EQ expansion titled the Scars of Velious.  Here's a snippet from the interview:<UL><b>IGN PC: What was the decision behind making Velious basically a land-only upgrade instead of adding any new races or classes? Do you think Velious has more to offer in terms of plot and depth than the original EQ or the Kunark expansion pack? </b><br><br>Jeff Butler: The Velious storyline largely precluded a new player race. Historically, the presence of the dragons, and the remote location of Velious prevented other intelligent races from establishing a foothold there. Insofar as additional classes are concerned, we are pretty satisfied with the 14 currently available, and haven&#8217;t made any plans to include more in the foreseeable future. In terms of plotline, Velious does indeed offer greater depth, with nearly the entire continent embroiled in age-old conflict. </UL>

Today on the Gameplay Board, Gordon Wrinn stopped by and had the following to say: <UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/025249.html"><b>Complaints Against Abashi</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi didn't even know that a snared and fleeing MoB stopped when he got to really low on health.]</i></font><br> <br>Point of order here Arkanon. I've seen you make this comment in nearly a dozen threads over the past couple of weeks. I'm not sure where you are getting it from, but what you mention is hardly an EQ secret. <br><br>I imagine that it may have come from a misquote in regards to the bard/chains issue, however that issue dealt with the amount of HP the snared creature had when they stopped, not the fact that they stop at all. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Oh, come now. A level 50ish necro could not possibly be ignorant of the fact that snares stop runners ]</i></font><br><br>My point exactly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/025487.html"><b>Apologizes & Public Reprimands</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: After playing EQ on and off since release, I've finally given up on ever being right and a GM wrong. No matter how blatant of a skrew up a GM makes they will never get publicly reprimanded]</i></font> <br><br>Companies don't publicly reprimand employees. It's just not professional, and not to mention, it's actionable. These issues are dealt with in private, and believe me, we do deal with them when they come up. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: no matter how badly Verant skrews up we will never get an apology.]</i></font> <br><br>That however is certainly not true. I know that I've posted and apologized many times when decisons that were made were in the wrong. Heck, they are human, and everyone makes mistakes from time to time. Not every mistake is one where we are going to rush off and terminate someone. Most of them can be chalked up to new situations where there are substantial shades of gray. <br><br>There are nearly 20K requests for assistance of one kind or another per day on the servers alone. The fact that the number of people who are dissatisfied by their service is so small is quite commendable. That said, we're always working to improve customer service, but I do think that it is a given that no matter how good customer service is, there will always be people who are dissatisified and bring it here to the boards. Likewise, no matter how well trained the staff is, there will always be mistakes made from time to time. All we can do is consistantly strive to reduce the number from week to week.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/025405.html"><b>Bug That Needs Acknowledgement</b></a><br>I've heard of this before. It sounds like an NPC group problem. NPCs decide whether or not they are going to attack each other based on faction, but decide whether or not to assist based on what we call a Group ID. I'll see if one of the guys can look into this tomorrow.</UL>

He was not as experianced as the other great warriors, he did not have the incredible armor or mystical weapons of the other warriors"<br><br>"Kamzan finished in the top 4 that day, defeating several 60th warriors in the best armor in the world of Norrath"<br><br>"For these actions, he earned a title that only 3 in the world of EverQuest can hold.

No he did not, But every champion there wept when he fell, only a blade slash away from victory."<br><br>**Lady Daegarmo walks behind her desk, pulls another picture off the wall, handing it to her guest again**<br><br>**This is a picture of a Fires of Heaven group, in the pre-round matches of the Third Test of Tactics**<br><br>"You notice they are all naked? This was before the finding of the lands of Kunark, and every member on both sides were of 50 trainings"<br><br>"As you can see, the defeated lying on the ground are in full armor"<br><br>**Lady Daegarmo pulls 2 more pictures off the wall, handing them both to her guest**<br><br>"These are pictures of Cunnan's Brewing Company, on Xegony"<br><br>"A small guild that defeated one of the greatest uber-guilds in the First and Second Test of Tactics"<br><br>"How did they win? This group, instead of hunting for armor or weapons, practiced for nearly a week straight before both events"<br><br>**Lady Daegarmo waits until her guest is done looking at the pictures, and places them back on the wall behind her desk**<br><br>**Lady Daegarmo points to another picture**<br><br>"This is a picture of Wendolyn of Afterlife, who defeated Reefman on Hidden Power. Everyone stated that the Champion of Rallos Zek could not be defeated, she proved that even those from peaceful realms could defeat those from the lands of Zek."<br><br>**Lady Daegarmo points to another picture**<br><br>"This picture is of Wintermist, a ranger of the 32nd training, whose arrows flew truer then the arrows of a 50th."<br><br>"Shame, I can't remember the ranger of 50 trainings she defeated. Nor would I probably of remembered the ranger of 50 trainings had he won."<br><br>**Lady Daegarmo turns around and looks at the guest who is now unsure of what to say.**<br><br>"These are not fiction or made up, these are true legends of Norrath. These heroes are the reason I keep the rules as they are, so that greater victories can be made for others"<br><br>"You tell me of a Knight that was unjustly defeated in combat, and I will agree with you that it does happen"<br><br>"Those that risk the most, and defeat the greatest of odds will be called heroes, and will forever have a story that can be told countless times near the campfire"<br><br>"Stories of such great honor hold more value to a soul then the greatest of weapons, the strongest of armors, and countless platinum pieces"<br><br>"I agree with you that stories like these are few and far between, but the glory for those that overcome these odds are what makes the difference between a champion, and a legend."<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Verant Interactive<br>Online Events Coordinator</I></UL>

Lady Dae made a lengthy post on subject of event organization.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000108.html">complete post</a>:<UL><I>There seems to be some very heated discussion on this board about the rules, the decisions, and the handeling of the events.<br><br>Events are an ongoing process where we run events, make mistakes, learn from the mistakes, and make changes so that the next events we run have less mistakes.<br><br>Are we ever going to run a perfect event that pleases every customer in every aspect? <br><br>I doubt it. <br><br>We will strive for it, but with some 300,000 players, we cannot please everyone.<br><br>With the discussion of level divisions for events, the one currently in question is levels 29 to 38. Could I simply change the rules to state that the event is now levels 34 to 38?<br><br>Sure I could.<br><br>What did I just do? I just told the levels 29 to 34 they could not participate and took away a chance for enjoyment for those players. Does a level 29 have a chance against a level 38?<br><br>Probably not.<br><br>Why do I let the Level 29 enter? <br><br>We have schedueled the time of an Event Master, a Game Master, and Guides to running this event. If a level 29 wishes to participate, he knows that his chances of winning are slim if he faces a Level 38.<br><br>I feel that giving the level 29 an option to participate in this event is better then having him sit on the sidelines dreaming of the day that he can also enter an event.<br><br>Cutting the levels allowed into an event does not give us the ability to double the amount of events we run.<br><br>Twinking is part of EverQuest. Norrath is a have and have not society just like the real world. It is also a "Grey" topic, not a black and white. If a warrior comes into the event in a full set of Crafted Armor, when everyone else is wearing chainmail, I advise the player that he cannot enter in crafted. The customer may not have another set of armor that he can simply wear. What did I just do?<br><br>Told another customer that he cannot enter this event.<br><br>My dedication is to allowing as many players to enjoy events as possible. This will not be hacked to pieces regardless of how many posts are made, emails are sent, or people stomping their feet.<br><br>Perhaps in the future, we will offer some variations of the rules to have both non-specific equipment events, and specific equipment events.<br><br>If you do not like the rules, or the way that VI is handeling the events, I ENCOURAGE you to run your own events.<br><br>Design your event, place your own limitations on levels, equipment, spells, classes, and other factors. Set up a date and time. Set up your own entry fee, go out and get your own prizes to offer. Post your message here, the same that I do, and run your own event.<br><br>We have, and are still making mistakes, as you will find yourself doing when running events. We are not "Gods" who do everything perfect, we do make errors.<br><br>There have been some mistakes made by myself, and the events staff in the Test of Tactics - Best of the Best. We are going to finish this event, compile all data received, look for feedback on this board, and make revisions for the next Test of Tactics - Best of the Best.<br><br>Perhaps the next Test of Tactics will allow full range of spells, including all enchanter spells, all activatable items, and almost no rules for those involved.<br><br>Perhaps we will start another series of events that will be run with very limited selection of items and gear.<br><br>We shall see, the Events Staff will review all data and feedback after the events, as we have always done when the events are completed.<br><br>Good luck, and see you on the battlefield<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Events Coordinator<br>Verant Interactive</I></UL>

Gordon was back on the boards and made a few new posts today:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/025282.html"><b>Jewlery</b></a><br>Jewelery is widely considered to be the most profitable trade-skill, well worth the effort, time, and investment if one can generate the business.

It is *not* appropriate to make continued exceptions, as prohibited conduct tends to escalate when continual exceptions are made for violations of the rules. I realize that the monk may have said it was a mistake, but I've not known players to tie the "INCOMING" warning to the /shout channel. It's usually tied to /gsay. <br><br>The GMs have to maintain order in these events or they will never be done. They *are* done for the benefit of the players, and if players are allowed to disrupt them they affect everyone's gameplay. I realize that you do not agree with the decision, but I don't think either laziness or favoritism has been demonstrated. </UL>

I received the following report from Imag:<BLOCKQUOTE>Today on Tholuxe Paells the Loathsome Individuals despawned.  Supposedely the Qeynos guards took an Arch Priest which was of some importance to them.  Thinking this was a GM event, Destiny's Soldiers headed to Qeynos Hills and waited.  <br><br>Later a few members (Karver to name one) heard Jayania Barrek shouting for help in Qeynos on the docks.  She was trying to recover her wedding ring which was taking from three fish in the water.  She pouted over and over because if her husband caught her without her wedding ring he would hurt her.  <br><br>Finally after killing two of the fish, the third ran around obviousely cowering, and we found him a little ways out of the docks, when we killed him he dropped Jayania Barrek's Wedding Ring (lore, class: all race: all, no stats).  I brought it up to Jayania and handed it to her (Screenshot shows the ring), in return I was giving 50pp in gold.  <br><br>Then the husband came in full plate, which is quite a suprise for a server thats only been open for a few months and told his wife he wanted dinner, following him he became angry and talked about how Halas was so much better than Qeynos.  Finally when he was about to zone I attacked him with an attack spell, hoping that he would come up on the other side of the zone we waited, but it ended up he did not.  We searched Qeynos Hills, Blackburrow, EverFrost, and Halas, no sign of him or his wife, but at least it was something to talk about :).<br> <br>Imag<br>14 Wizard Erudite<br>Destiny's Soldiers<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/jayaniabarrek1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you.

An interesting event recently took place on the Tunare server.  Here's a report courtesy of Qhue:<BLOCKQUOTE>Qhue of Tunare here,<br><br>Last night on Tunare we were treated to the Trial of<br>Mordavin in Qeynos.  This would appear to be the first<br>or second part of a new epic plotline.<br><br>A brief summary:<br><br>Mordavin Telase was brought up for trial for a variety<br>of crimes related to his possession of certain Scrolls<br>of Life and accusations of the poisoning of the waters<br>of Surefall Glade.  Prosecution of the accused was<br>done by Vegalys Keldrane a Magistrate of Qeynos.  In<br>attendance was Anotnius Bayle himself as well as a<br>variety of expert witnesses including Holly<br>Windstalker representing the rangers of Surefall and<br>Al'Kabor as expert magical testimony.<br><br>Through the course of the trial we learned that the<br>scrolls Mordavin had acquired plus other resources<br>were designed to summon an Avatar of Bertoxxulous to<br>Norrath!  This included the construction of a shrine<br>by Human and Gnoll laborers whose location was not<br>revealed.  Near the end of the proceedings ,after the<br>evidence against Mordavin had been built up<br>substantially, the area was attacked by vile undead<br>minions of Bertoxxulous and Mordavin managed to escape<br>in the confusion while people battled to keep the King<br>from harm.  <br><br>Antonius Bayle was quite beside himself with rage over<br>the actions of the Bloodsabers and vowed to never<br>again turn a deaf ear upon the words of his people and<br>to take a more active role in the lives of the peoples<br>of Qeynos and the Karanas.  Mordavin in turn warned us<br>all to sleep warmly these next few nights for they<br>would be our last.  He claims that from Paineel to<br>Ak'anon the world will know the deadly Plague of<br>Bertoxxulous before his plans are finished.<br><br>The event concluded with Holly Windstalker and the<br>rangers of Surefall being charged by Velgalys Keldrane<br>with finding the trail of Mordavin so that he can be<br>hunted down and brought to justice before his insane<br>plans can go further.<br><br>This event, plus the Epic Quest battle the druids are<br>facing that reveals the alliance between Innoruuk and<br>Bertoxxulous in corrupting nature across the planet<br>seems to indicate that Bertoxxulous is taking a much<br>more active hand in the lives of Norrath's citizens. <br>Beware the Plaguebringers indeed.<UL><li><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/thetrial.jpg">Screenshot #1</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

Jhared issued the following report to us:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night in Qeynos Hills, Protector Holly Windstalker notified us of Cros Treewind's death.<br><br>She informed us that a defiled Grizzly Bear (the mate of Mammoth) had in fact killed and eaten Cros.<br><br>She asked for us all to search for the bear.<br><br>Our guild, the House of Irsei, who were traveling through the Hills on our way to Qeynos sprang into action. Our tracker, Surfal Dayspring quickly caught the trail and we followed him through the Hills to a secluded spot near the fishing pond. There we found the Defiled Grizzly. It was a huge bear and we discovered it was no easy prey. After what seemed to be a very long time, we finally overcame the beast.<br><br>It was the mighty hand of our best warrior, Gilthalas Bella which slew the maddened animal and cheers went out across the Hills in Gilthalas' name.<br><br>Inside the beast's belly, our leader Ulandra found a horrifying discovery -- Cros Treewind's staff. This removed any doubt that he had in fact fallen victim to the very thing he had fought so hard to protect.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, Protector Holly held a rememberence service outisde Surefall Glade for the lost Druid, who she said had been the epitome of a Jaggedpine Treeman. Although there was some grumbling amongst those gathered that Cros had been a self-righteous bully, everyone said kind words on his behalf and Gilthalas and his sister Trina Bella approached Holly. They presented her with the staff and she was overcome with emotion.<br><br>After thanking Gilthalas and Trina profusely, she also presented them with a gift -- A Bag of the Tinkerers.<br><br>She thanked each member of our order who were on hand as well, who were as follows:<br><br><i>Arsindrick Tabasheer<br>Mortavious Valorous<br>Trina Bella<br>Gilthalas Bella<br>Ulandra<br>Surfal Dayspring<br>Redwyn<br>Jhared Irsei </i><br> <br>and our dear friends Yora of the Dark Knights of Justice and Valarie Freistvalkyry of the Celestial Keepers. <br>  <br>Jhared Irsei<br><a href="mailto:jhared@longroadjournals.com">jhared@longroadjournals.com</a><uL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/holly1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/holly2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Lefourgue informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>THE LOST SCROLL<br>A Roleplay event on Mithaniel Marr<br>When: Friday the 20h of October, from 3 PM to 6 PM (EST)<br>Where: East Commons, on Mithaniel Marr<br>Who: Lvl 6-10 characters<br><br>From Lefourgue Beauregard, head of the Lodge of Bayle:<br><br>Our investigation on the rumoured return of Miragul led us to study ancient<br>texts and records, relating the tragic tale of the woman who opened her arms<br>and her books of arcane lore for him. She was a Teir'Dal sorceress, the<br>first of her kind to tread so far on the forbidden path of Necromancy.<br>Her name was Argarwaen. A daughter of Neriak's royal family, she had no lust<br>for secular power, only for the surge of tainted mana and the thrill of<br>playing hide and seek with Death itself. Unwilling to play the political<br>game she was taught as a potential heir to the throne, she left her hometown<br>for newfound Erudin.<br><br>Her true nature disguised by powerful illusions, she learned much from the<br>Human mages. To those who had a dark shard stuck in their hearts, she taught<br>the rudiments of her own art. Thus, she built a court of followers. It is<br>well known how Miragul joined this secret college of outcasts. But few are<br>those who know that he became the lover of the Teir'Dal princess.<br>When the war broke out between the Erudites and the Heretics, Miragul fled<br>north. As for Argarwaen, she left Odus and built herself an underground<br>palace in what is now known as the Commonlands. There, our sources diverge.<br>Some scholars pretend she became mad out of waiting for her lover's return,<br>others hint that she was cursed by Miragul himself because she had failed<br>him in one way of another, and a third school of thought suggests that Death<br>is not without its sick sense of humour, and that the Great Harvester of<br>Souls refused to sever Argarwaen's lifecord, sentencing the Dark Elf to an<br>eternity of torment. However, all agree on their conclusion: Argarwaen's<br>spirit never found peace.<br><br>What is the relevance of this story with our current research you may ask.<br>Well, learn that our Erudite brethren from Paineel have unearthed a long<br>forgotten scroll which could allow us to summon Argarwaen's restless ghost<br>and ask her about Miragul's whereabouts!<br><br>Alas, the scroll has been stolen by a perfidious shadowknight named<br>Filsdebayle. We tracked the traitor, cornered him in East Commons and killed<br>him, but the precious document was nowhere to find. Further investigation<br>led us to believe that it is now in the hands of the Deathfist Orcs, with<br>whom Filsdebayle had contracted an alliance...<br><br>/ooc GameLoft, a French site dedicated to EverQuest, invites all level 6-10<br>characters to attend its third in-game event, which will start in East<br>Commonlands, and culminate in Befallen. We promise you thrill, romance,<br>blood, spectacular lightshow and free beer! More precious gifts will also<br>reward the heroes of the event. Departure will take place at the Nektulos<br>pass in EC, but if you are late, you can join us at Orc 2 (until 4 PM). <br>To join in, please indicate your class, race and level to Radharc<br>[eobert@gameloft.com].

Lady Dae stopped by and responded to a few threads recently on the Arena board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000071.html"><b>Recent Bard Tournament</b></a><br>Do I expect a level 29 to defeat a level 39? <br><br>No I do not. <br><br>Do I expect a level 29 to enter the event for knowledge, learning, and to have fun, so that in future events he can do better? <br><br>Yes I do. <br><br>We are trying to make things fun for as many players as possible. This means that there needs to be a wide spread of levels. While I would love to keep it +/- 4 levels (Rallos Zek range), we are trying to get the excitement out to everyone. <br><br>We are aware of the level differences involved in the match. This is the best we can do with still having a decent size event, Im sorry. <br><br>We are aware of the twinking, and how they ruin events, but unless the items are obsene for their level, we are leaving them alone. Again, my appologies. <br><br>To give a breakdown on every piece of equipment that a player can and cannot have at level X is impossible. The GMs are allowed to use judgement on items that are way out of range, and ask the player to put those items away. <br><br>The issue that saddens me here is that no where in your wonderful post did you say you had fun. <br><br>We will work on making things better in the future, see you in the arena.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000074.html"><b>Short Notice on Tallon Zek</b></a><br>I have heard a lot of complaints about the limited warning on Tallon Zek. I have not yet heard any complaints about the Nameless Event that was also run today. <br><br>I will look into this matter and contact the Server Management Team of Tallon Zek and see if there was a breakdown in communication between the events staff and the Tallon Zek population. <br><br>While I would love to hold all events on the weekend, The Events staff at this time is not capable of fullfilling that request. If I had a team of 35 EventMasters, I would run them all on the weekend I assure you. <br><br>If I find out that Tallon Zek had little to no knowledge of the event before it was run, I will consider a second event and sending a second team to the finals. <br><br>This is still based on the results of the investigation that will be run, no promises at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000081.html"><b>Required Levels</b></a><br>There have been just as many, if not more, events given to the less then 50s then the greater then 50s. <br><br>At this time we do not give a lot of advanced warning on minor events, and just enough time on major events, so that the events can actually run. <br><br>If we gave a month warning for a mid level event, 300 people would show up and we would not be able to run it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000075.html"><b>Test of Tactics - Day One</b></a><br>Tallon Zek Winners : The Patryns<br>Tallon Zek Field Size : 8 Teams (55 Players) <br><br>Lazdal the Tactician (59 BAR SHA) <br><br>Tssunami (56 HUM MONK)<br>Druegan (55 DWA CLE)<br>Cuick the Silent(59 ELF ROG)<br>Lightadam (56 HIE WIZ)<br>Kreepindeath (58 HUM ENC)<br>Dumnezeu (53 HUM CLE) <br><br>The Nameless Winners : Legacy of Steel<br>The Nameless Field Size : 4 Teams (26 Players) <br><br>Tenaj the Tactician (60 DEL WIZ) <br><br>Magosian (59 HUM WIZ)<br>Ariel (60 ELF WAR)<br>Arlos (57 HUM MONK)<br>Vertulias (56 TRO WAR)<br>Barnabuss (60 DWA CLE) <br><br>This team waived the 7th person, which is within the rules. <br><br>Rule Change was made that if players wish to enter without the 5kpp entry fee, they may do so but waive their rights to prizes. <br><br>I will not be announcing the prizes of the event, if players wish to do so, that is their right. <br><br>More to come tomorrow, finalized scheduel will be posted tonight.</UL>
