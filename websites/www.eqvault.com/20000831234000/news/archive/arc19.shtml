The guys at the Electric Playground have kicked up a <a href="http://www.elecplay.com/review.html?article=2572">new review of  Ruins of Kunark</a>.  Also included in the article is some commentary on the current state of the game.  The overall score they give the expansion is an 8.8 rating.  Here's a clip:<UL>The designers of Everquest had the best intentions when creating the world<br>of Norrath. Unfortunately, very few of the gamers who populated this world<br>chose to play in the expected fashion. Verant envisioned players exploring<br>wilderness locales and crawling through dungeons as they quested for power<br>in a classic Dungeons and Dragons style of play. The gamers of Everquest had<br>other ideas and an entirely different style of play. Exploration gave way to<br>finding spots with bottomless experience pools, dungeon crawls resulted in<br>room camping and item farming and the quest for power ground to an annoying<br>and bickering mess of players fighting over the right to sit and kill<br>monsters in a repetitious cycle of boredom.</UL>Thanks Sean!

Here are the latest quotes and excerpts made by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050276-2.html"><b>Warriors Getting Gate?</b></a><br>It's a fake. <br><br>If we were going to put Gate on a non-caster item it would be deep in Veeshan's Peak and drop at a rate of like 5 per year.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050419.html"><b>Gordon Exploting?</b></a><br>Though I really don't care to get involved in this thread, I should probably point out that falls not causing XP loss on the PvP servers isn't a bug. It's part of a ruleset specific change in design to reduce the impact of DOT deaths, bleeding to death, and Pet kills were causing XP loss in PvP combat.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050337.html"><b>What happened to Kunark refunds?</b></a><br>George Scotto (<a href="mailto:gscotto@station.sony.com">gscotto@station.sony.com</a>) is handling issues related to the Kunark shipping problems directly. Feel free to drop him an email. <br><br>I apologize for the problems you've experienced.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050341.html"><b>More Armor Questions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I would much rather be able to wear plate. We all know that it was supposedly the limit of texture memory that caused us not to be able to wear plate. You cripple a nice race/class combo for that reason?]</i> <br><br>That's not the reason at all. They can't wear plate because it chafes their scales. There are still 4 different texture sets for the Iksar just like any other race. The hardiest just isn't considered "plate". <br><br>Of course the hardiest stuff will still be less AC than the plate in the game since Iksar get an innate AC bonus by virtue of having scales.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050370.html"><b>Class Testing</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi - Why we don't think Verant does throrough class testing...]</i> <br><br>What's an issue here is the definition of "thorough". It's simple math, 250K players can find more issues in a given amount of real time than everyone here at Verant, or everyone on the Test Server combined. <br><br>Mistakes happen. I apologize here on the board for them. I take every step possible to reduce the chance of their occuring. They still happen, and will *always* happen. <br><br>EQ is not a linear game where there is a specific and small set of things that a player can do. It's a complex system where thousands upon thousands of people are doing thousands of different things, all at the same time. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050373.html"><b>Harvest</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I think that the recast on harvest is too long, because the small burst of mana every 10 minutes isn't a huge difference. (i love the spell effs btw)]</i> <br><br>Harvest is ok. It is something that you have now that you didn't have before. I realize that everyone wants more, but keep in mind that we have balance issues to consider. The extra mana every 10 minutes easily eliminates on period of meditation per hour. It's fair. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050406.html"><b>Gordon on Kunark</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2) In Norrath proper these mobs will chase you all the way to zone to kill you because they are mad at you.]</i> <br><br>No, they don't. All over, NPCs will not pursue you if you are out of a certain range. Try rooting a fire beetle on the Northeast side of east commons, then run with SoW to the Nro Tunnel. If you get far enough away before the root breaks, it won't pursue. <br><br>The zones being bigger in Kunark do probably exacerbate the problem, since the zones are bigger, and someone is more likely to be able to run a good distance without hitting a zone border. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: In Kunark the mobs won't follow once you get out of spell range, which is very short and very dumb. They should follow you until out of visual range, and maybe even then.]</i> <br><br>Are there specific mobs that only follow you for this short distance? I'd like to get a list of zones and specific critters that have this problem. I asked for it once before, but didn't get much of a response.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050247.html"><b>Melee Classes Getting Robbed?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Non melee classes getting ROBBED, avoiding the PvP switch, ABASHI!!!! Its called Disarm.  So what do casters have to do to make $$, camp, quest, KS!!!, and other undesireable actions.]</i> <br><br>Disarm is not at all reliable enough for this to be effective, so we wouldn't consider it a cheat. Thought I don't have the exact formula handy, I'd be surprised if one in twenty weapon-wielding critters could be disarmed on the first attempt before getting back to the group.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050181.html"><b>Server Listing Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: WHen will the server list go back to server population rather than alphabetical?]</i> <br><br>It's back to being listed by population. New users will see it that way, however since the new program stores preferences, existing people will see it in whatever order they had it set to the last time they entered the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050157.html"><b>Getting Harassed</b></a><br>There is absolutely no tolerance of character gender based harassment. It is handled with the same policies and with the same level of response as every other type of harassment possible. <br><br>If there is something that offends you, please /report it and /petition to let a GM know that a /report has been filed. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050034.html"><b>How do you react to people telling you your job?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Cleric, don't stun just heal. Druid, don't waste mana on thorns just heal. Bard, don't twist, just "play the mana song." Wizards, don't stun, just nuke.]</i> <br><br>Well I've always been of the feeling that a person who built the class up from scratch knows more about the class than someone who hasn't, but I have run across a cleric or two who wanted to be wizards. There's nothing worse than being the first person in the group to call for a heal and being met with an "OOM!". <br><br>Not meaning to take this thread off topic, but this is one of the reasons that it wouldn't make much sense for me to endulge a common request on this board that I "Whip up a level 50 XXXX and see how well you do!". Unless I personally build the class from scratch, or at least get some serious calendar time playing it, I wouldn't exactly be a very good example. I certainly wouldn't even be an average example of the class.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050139.html"><b>Closing Rallos Zek Threads</b></a><br>No, it's not censoring, it's spam control. Deleting the threads would have been censoring. <br><br>Systematically bumping all threads of a specific issue to the front page is spam and is not something that we want to encourage. When this happened a few weeks ago with threads on another issue, I said at that time that we'd close the threads. <br><br>I'm sorry that this was necessary, but artificially elevating the apparent importance in this topic doesn't help your case. It in fact hurts it, because supporters of the issue don't know where to post their followups. For instance, instead of getting 22 people posting in support under one thread, you end up with one person posting in support of 22 different threads. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049576.html"><b>Monks and Stun</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I just read something on a warriors kick being able to stun at a given level? My question, Abashi, is: If a warriors, oh say 15 damage kick, can stun a target...don't you think a monk's 100+ damage kick would knock the target out for a few minutes?]</i> <br><br>It's a good argument Mooo: If a warrior can stun a target with a Kick, and monks kick so much better, then monks should stun. <br><br>However, this is one of those cases where gameplay supercedes realism. For balance reasons, we can't give monks stuns in this manner. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049910.html"><b>Few Armor Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1. You said a long time ago Verant wanted to increase Pally/SK quest armor AC without nerfing rangers. Did anything ever come of this?]</i> <br><br>I don't think that it was this that was said. What I believe that was said (and we're talking like 5 months ago now) was that it wasn't the Paly/SK mid-level quest armor that had AC that was too low, but rather the ranger armor AC that was too high, and that we didn't want to nerf rangers. <br><br>I think it was also said at that point that deciding not to nerf in a particular case did not mean that we'd automatically upgrade everyone else. So by deciding not to nerf ranger armor we weren't saying that we'd up Paly and SK AC. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2. You also said a long time ago you'd look into increasing the crusader spawn (darkforge armor quest). Anything ever become of this?]</i> <br><br>Again 5 months ago, but as I recall we decided against it. Frequently when new items come into existance, there's a rush of people that want them. Since everyone wants them, a shortage *in relation to demand* is present. However, after a period of time goes by, supply and demand even out. <br><br>We try to avoid upping spawn-times or item creation rates based upon info received within a short time after item availability as the data is skewed by the new-item rush.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049962.html"><b>Broken Quests</b></a><br>Thanks for the post Qwinn. I'll send it to the test team. There's a couple that I can comment on now: <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 3) The Cannibalize 2 quest is broken. Dread Diamonds do not seem to be dropping anywhere.]</i> <br><br>It's not broken. It's been confirmed and completed by players. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: There is a quest in the Qeynos bard's guild that involves delivering lute strings to a npc named Fabian. No one's ever seen him.]</i> <br><br>I commented in a Bard thread the other day about this one saying that it was flavor/future expansion. This was apparently incorrect. I read the list wrong, and information on what the deal with this quest is is still pending. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: A special Bardic weapon" mentioned by one of the Bard NPCs in Temple of Sol Ro. May not count as 'broken', but merely unimplemented.]</i> <br><br>This one *is* unimplemented and for future expansion of the storyline. It doesn't count as "broken". <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Blued Two Handed Hammer]</i> <br><br>As I recall, this is one of those rumors that floats around<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049983.html"><b>Naming Bug</b></a><br>We are aware of the problem regarding the names showing for skeleton models as well as a couple of others. It's on the list, and we hope to fix it at some point.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049251.html"><b>PoS Question</b></a><br>I'm not sure what, if anything, will happen with this particular item, but the Plane of Sky items in general are getting a second look, particularly the lower level items. <br><br>I don't think anyone has really gone to the upper levels there. There are still a bunch of things that haven't been found.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/047422-3.html"><b>Will there ever be a non-planar wizard only robe?</b></a> <br>Much like other cases where people are asking for items, quests, etc., of a certain nature, anything is possible but we wouldn't comment on any specific plans of this nature, one way or the other.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048194-2.html"><b>Why is Emerald Jungle so underitemized?</b></a><br>I've asked the test team to look into the loot issues there. It was updated the other day but there's certainly a chance that something didn't get exported. If that's the case, we'll get it fixed ASAP.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049223-4.html"><b>Abusive Players</b></a><br>I'm really sorry that Crystana had to hear the things that she did. We do not at all condone that sort of behavior, language filter or no language filter. <br><br>When this happens you should /report the incident (with it in the chat window, scroll up if you have to), then /petition the issue to let use know that you've filed the report and who you've filed it about. <br><br>The GM will look up the report and give the person a warning just like that and take further action when warranted.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/046941.html"><b>PvP Update</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: What I would like to know, and im sure many others from Tallon, is if players from RZ or VZ are going to be allowed to move to us, are we going to be offered the chance to move to them, thus theoretically moving all the people unhappy with coin loot on Tallon the chance to go to a community where they get to do what they want, and all the people on RZ and VZ get to move to us, hopefully keeping some semblance of balance on the populations .]</i> <br><br>I understand your concerns and agree with most of them. We absolutely dislike the idea of messing with an existing server community in a manner that those in the community would find offensive. In this particular case we're only allowing people unhappy with the current looting arrangements to switch between Vallon and Tallon in an effort to try and make people on both servers happy. <br><br>We basically broke the rule above when we switch Tallon to Coin Only, but we needed try a few things with PvP to try and see what the players there *REALLY* want. As I'm sure you can see from the board here, some things aren't actually representative of the way the population really feels. <br><br>As for Rallos, there are no plans for this server at present. In all likelihood, we'll leave it's loot rules the same, since there isn't a sister server to split people off to. We don't intend to allow people from Rallos to move to Tallon, as the rulesets and the way PvP is handled in code is *very* different. In addition, Rallos went live the same time EQ did, whereas TZ and VZ came up much later, but at the same time as each other. <br><br>We'll be looking at how things turn out after the TZ/VZ/TZ move before making any further decisions.</UL>

I discovered the following announcement made by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><I>Hello Everyone,<br><br>As many noticed in the last patch message, the Gunthak Harpoon (a 15/31 piercer) was made a rentable (meaning permanent) item. As it turns out, this was a big mistake on our part. Basically, one of the guys on the Team received an email about it being NORENT, figured that this was a bug, and fixed the item.<br><br>Even with the item's disadvantages, its stats make it something that should only have been available in the deepest parts of Veeshan's Peak, if at all. <br><br>In the next item patch, it will again be made NORENT, meaning that it will disappear like a summoned item the next time you log off. I do apologize to those who obtained the item in the meantime.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

This means that if the player base were equally divided, at most less then 8% of the player base (over level 7) would have ever even used this skill, let alone understands it. Rogues are one of the least played classes, which makes this percentage even smaller. It is my goal to share with you the workings of Pick Pocket.</i></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Kambic!

Over 45 posts have been made by Verant's Gordon Wrinn over the course of the last 24 hours on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the latest from him:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050006.html"><b>I lost my identity!</b></a><br>These problems seem to run in spurts. <br><br>As I mentioned in another thread today, any time we require human intervention and interpretation of a policy, there are bound to be mistakes. <br><br>In this case, the GM should have made the least significant change possible to correct the violation of the policy. In this case, that would have been just changing the last name. <br><br>I've coordinated with the Head GM on the issue and your first name will be changed back. Please accept our apologies for the incident.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049979.html"><b>Bugged Deaths</b></a><br>There are a couple of issue. Please keep in mind that in order to do a rez for a bug death, the GM or Guide in question has to be able to verify that that is what occured, so something like this wouldn't result in a rez. <br><br>Secondly, this bug itself wouldn't result in a rez even assuming that it was verified. NPCs attack. They attack without warning and provocation. The fact that an NPC somewhere had you on the hatelist, but was too far away to consider chasing you, and was propagating that hatelist to new NPCs that spawned who *were* in range to chace after you, is a design issue that players just have to deal with at the moment. Everything that is happening in this case is *intended*, it just *sucks*. Sometimes things that "suck" are described as bugs, but aren't bugs in sense of something that we can fix readily, or that we would give a rez for. <br><br>For example, NPCs aggroing through walls/ceilings/ and floors in some cases suck. It's not a bug. It's not something that we can fix without breaking a ton of other things. It often becomes a known danger of an area, and therefore a risk that is assumed for fighting there. Yes, as I said it sucks. Death happens. <br><br>In nearly 40 days of playtime that I've put in since August of last year, I died 3 times due to something out of my control. Twice was by disconnections, traced to my ISP, and once was to an honest to god bug, where I was feared by an NPC and promptly fell for 10K. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050005.html"><b>Hunting Solo Spawns</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: What incentive is there not to hunt solo spawns?]</i> <br><br>There's no problem with "hunting" solo spawns. Camping the same spot, killing the same NPC over and over again, because it's faster than doing anything else, and provides little to no risk, is the problem. <br><br>Solo stationary fast-spawns provide a really high reward for little risk. That is the core problem that we were addressing.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049848.html"><b>Overcrowding</b></a><br>If a server had 2200 people on it at peak before Kunark launched, and has 2200 people on at peak after Kunark lauched, then the crowding situation has to be improved, even though the number of people on at peak is still a bit high. <br><br>The expectation of course is that people have to spread out to the new zones. If that isn't happening, we need to come up with ways to encourage people to move into them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049885.html"><b>I was suspended for a "bad trade."</b></a><br>Giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, I'm happy to investigate issues like this, but I need the proper information. If you have the "ample proof" that you suggest, please email it to me at <a href=mailto:gwrinn@verant.com>gwrinn@verant.com</a>. Please also doublecheck the GMs name. We don't have a GM using that alias. We had a Guide a while back that had a name very close to that, but he resigned a few months ago.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049895.html"><b>Why is the loot in Kurn's Tower non-existant?</b></a><br>Thank you for posting your observations. I'll forward them to the Live team and see if we can get them to check it out. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049846.html"><b>Why do I get hit by mobs attacking my pet a half zone away? </b></a><br>Hrm. I thought that this bug was corrected several months back. I had a situation where I was fighting Ice Giants with a friend. He rooted the giant, but somehow got too close and got killed. The giant, from half-way across the zone was able to hit me. I was lucky enough to be able to dive off of a cliff with about 10 hitpoints left to avoid XP loss. <br><br>If anyone can come up with a way to reproduce the NPCs hitting you from halfway across an outdoor zone, our testing team would love to hear about it at <a href=mailto:eqtesting@verant.com>eqtesting@verant.com</a><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049733.html"><b>Why aren't there natural disastors in Kunark as you promised?</b></a><br>You're talking about earthquakes and manastorms and such? <br><br>Some marketing guys read the design doc for Kunark and took some of the things in there a little too literally. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049744.html"><b>Ninja Looting</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Ninja Looting? Will Verant stop this madness. Pictures and links of what went on!!!!]</i> <br><br>Please, give us some credit. We do everything possible to stop this sort of antisocial behavior. We put in loot messages so people would know it is happening, and we put in a policy making it illegal. We get involved with it and try to take care of the issue as much as we can. <br><br>That said, though we try, we can't be everywhere at once. If we can't respond to your particular case right away, unique names on the servers give you some recourse. Please note also that we won't dupe an item to fix a situation. Until the item can be removed from the person who did it, it's out of play. <br><br>The point I am making is that yes, we do everything within our power to keep people from using dishonest and illegal tactics to disrupt the enjoyment of the game for others, but the responsibility for it happening lies with the person committing the act.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049769.html"><b>A Gunthak Harpoon Discussion</b></a><br>You definitely have a point. I know that one of the guys had heard several complaints about it being NORENT. It's possible that he just took the initiative and "fixed" the item. If we did make a big mistake making it rentable, we'll probably have to correct it. <br><br>The stats that I'm hearing, espicially the high DMG rating, sound in excess of what should be available with the amount of work you are describing. <br><br>I'll check into it tomorrow, and thanks for the info.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049719.html"><b>Abashi Note Evil, Making Game Decisions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: ABASHI, I know you are not an EVIL person . . . .]</i> <br><br>Thanks for the benefit of the doubt :) <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: But wouldn't it make sense to open a dialog with your customers? Can't we discuss this ranger issue more concretely? Can't we somehow resolve this to our mutual satisfaction?]</i> <br><br>Two issues, <br><br>Firstly, though I realize that not everyone here on the board for the initial discussion is present now, there was a good deal of dialog about the issue when it first came out. The posts lately are basically bringing up the same arguments that have already been covered. At some point when there is a disagreement that isn't resolvable, one party needs to terminate the debate lest it goes on forever. I don't like the idea of saying "No" to every ranger post that pops up since that just upsets people and drives them on even more. So "ignoring" (meaning: not posting in reponse to them) them, or rather, focusing on other issues, becomes the best course of action <br><br>Secondly, where before we (meaning the tuning team) were absolutely firm on the issue, we're less certain now and are further debating the matter internally. It's not exactly appropriate for me to come out and establish or further a stance, whether it crushes or builds up hopes, unless we're agreed on the subject internally. <br><br>We've reviewed all of the issues presented. Though I do have faith that the issues can be presented in a number of different ways, all the facts are in. When we're again agreed internally, regardless the outcome, I'll be sure to let everyone know if anything changes. Please however don't let what I've said here turn into daily posts asking for an ETA for a decision. We need time to insure that whatever we end up deciding, is well-grounded, and not a kneejerk reaction.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049514.html"><b>Verant Vs. The Complainers</b></a><br>Thanks for the kind words thecrow00. <br><br>And it is true that everyone has their own set of issues that they feel needs to be addressed in some fashion or another. We'd actually be worried if we had a game as complex as this, and no one complained about anything. It would mean that either people just didn't care, or that they all had left. Neither situation would be good for us in the long run.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049528.html"><b>Soloing</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I would just like to make an irrefutable statement. Players will not get bored with the game because they are able to solo at any level, to some extent]</i> <br><br>I was with you up to this point. I disagree. If everyone is able to solo at every level, even "to some extent", then groups (which is what we want to encourage) would just run over encounters in the game. We provide classes designed to be able to solo. They are certainly limited in terms of where they can go, what they can do, and what they can acquire. <br><br>If the ability to solo is so important to someone that they always want it to be available, they should consider finding a class that has that capability. Of course, the downside of doing that is that you are often less desirable to the group. <br><br>Solo classes have to be jacks of all trades. They typically end up not doing things as well as group-oriented classes can. This has worked out quite nicely.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049492.html"><b>Tracking Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I seem to recall at one point you saying that Tracking was not working exactly as intended and that you were looking for suggestions to fix it?]</i> <br><br>Actually we said that it works appropriately and that we've no short term plans to enhance it. We'd like to improve it sometime, like other things in the game, they just can't all be on the docket at once. <br><br>Our focus now is creating new and enticing content that can keep people busy and entertained for a good deal of time, rather than just making everyone more efficient fighters.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049400-2.html"><b>Forgetting to Hand in Newbie Note</b></a><br>Those quests are linked and are one-chance deals to give something special to the Iksar that protects and safeguards his birthright throughout his life. <br><br>They are created with that in mind. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049388.html"><b>Super Mobs: Running, Casting, Melee'ing</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Mobs are intentionally made more powerful in the game because Verant assumes its players are more intelligent than their AI routines.]</i> <br><br>That's the deal. We also want to make the game suitable for groups, which requires some pretty nasty critters. <br><br>NPCs get other bonuses like never fizzling, and get to take advantage of some pretty spiffy regen rates. Even with all of their advantages, people still manage to kill them and advance (wouldn't be much of a game if you couldn't:). Of course, death is also part of the game, and it wouldn't be much of a game if it wasn't. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049154.html"><b>Quests & Events</b></a><br>First, let's sort out some definitions. <br><br>A Dynamic Quest is something that is run solely by the GM staff and not assembled specifically at players request. They range from something as simple as a minor invasion of an area (NPCs run in and kill everyone until a force comes to stop them.), or historical epics important for the storyline in the game (often run for weeks with individual phases or chapters that run for a few hours). The latter often contains a good deal of RP content, and is run across all servers. <br><br>Events, on the other hand, are typically player-initiated and organized affairs. Most of these can be done without GM assistance. Some of them, and I've seen some pretty complicated and intriguing events, require GM assistance in one form or another. <br><br>For "Events", we'll have an email address available soon, along with guidelines for requesting assistance to pull these off. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049152.html"><b>Cannibilize 2 Quest Broken?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Uh..It's been weeks since this quest went live..with 50,000 people NO ONE has found the diamonds yet. I believe they arent in the game. Could you do us a favor abashi and check it out yourself?]</i> <br><br>I just saw in another thread that someone found them and completed the quest. That thread contained a spoiler so I won't link it here, but it's evidently working. The dev team was right on this one, we'll get them next time :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049041.html"><b>Testing Bards</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well, it turns out that the test of flight is an archery contest. It looks fun, but as a bard, I cannot compete, because, despite the discovery of a bard usable bow]</i> <br><br>That bow being usable by bards was a mistake that was corrected a few patches ago. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: So basically, I found out that there is an event for every single class, except for bards.]</i> <br><br>Well, bards have always been pretty much in their own category, making something like this a bit difficult. Every melee capable class can out-melee them, and their songs aren't really appropriate to put up versus spells. Bards are probably the best example of a class that is balanced by usefulness to the group as a primary concern, with offensive power being further down the list. <br><br>If anyone has any ideas how some type of test for bards could be laid out, feel free to post your ideas here. I'll be happy to forward them to the Event Master.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049930-2.html"><b>Naming Incident</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well, I had my first experience with the naming commandos recently. It appears a Guide on my server just happened to be a history major, as he told me my name, Temujin, was spelled so closely to Ghengis Khan's birth name (Temojin, or some such) as to violate policy.]</i> <br><br>Like any situation that requires human judgement, there will be cases where mistakes are made and where the goals of the underlying policy are not met. That's what happened here. <br><br>The spirit of the name policy, particularly the section about names of historical significance and from popular media, is to judge names based upon knowledge that an average and reasonable person would have. This covers the ever-so-popular names like Gandalf and Merlin. <br><br>In your case, the change was definitely unjust, and I've coordinated with the Head GM to restore your chosen name. We sincerely apologize for the incident.</UL>

I received the following from Banegrivm:<BLOCKQUOTE>It all started on a cold day when the lightning pierced a murky sky and<br>the cold bitter winds blew through Norrath, a dark forbodeing of things<br>to come. All seemed well when the army that had valiantly defended high<br>keep had returned and sailed their crest upon a banner once more; the<br>1st Fist of Light returned. But then within the bowels of Neriak came a<br>stir amongst the Teir Dal. They had not forgotten their past, nor their<br>plans, and especially their defeat. There must be retribution! The "Fist of Hate" is born?<br><br>With the appearance of that dark standard came Drayvar, whereabouts<br>still unknown. Then appeared Mordeki, a ruthless shadow knight who<br>carried orders supposedly from the hand of Lanys, daughter of Innoruuk.<br>Mordeki poisoned a high priest in the process of collecting these orders<br><br>only hand them to Drayvar personaly. These orders commenced and<br>officiated in the new Hate army that was to crusade through Norrath in a retributive strike to eliminate the light army.<br><br>Then somewhere along the lines is believed Euthan (Banegrivm's brother)<br>and Martyr (who is now reportedly Euthans brother also) have also allied with the new hate army as well.<br><br>Then a letter arrives from Qeynos written by Chesgard, a Knight of<br>Thunder. A greta veil of shadow has begun to fall across the city of<br>Qeynos. Crops wither, fish found floating dead at sea, the graves of the<br><br>dead found torn open as a sore against the land, and strange sounds<br>began to fill the hills at night accompanied by the baying of wolves<br>beneath a witches moon. Rumors abound that the undying one had even<br>returned to the disheveled ruins nearby. Chesgard worried for the life<br>of his son, but was afraid to act for rumors and stories had been spread<br><br>as old wives tales about their good commander Kane, speaking of witchery<br><br>and demon worship.<br><br>After counseling with the the High Priestess of Rodcet Nife, within the<br>temple of life...she too concured with the knight that a great evil was<br>laying its grip fast about the city and if something was not done, then<br>the end would come...and darkness would reign supreme over the vassal.<br><br>Chesgard feared for the life of his son who patrolled the hills. He<br>could not bare the thought of losing him. This in mind the knight set<br>out upon the road and entered into the Rathe mountains. Here he entered<br>a valley enshrouded by a thick heavy fog, wherein he found a small band<br>of gypsies. He spoke to an old crone that saw in her visions the<br>darkness which that knight spoke upon.<br><br>She told him if he sought its source she needed to find the mariner who<br>had traveled the world over. Only then would the source of the evil that<br><br>plagued the good people of Qeynos be known. Her last words to Chesgard<br>as he departed were "the blood is on the walls." Later Chesgard<br>discovers from a local youth about a captain whose ship is in dry doc at<br><br>port and comes to believe this may in fact be the same "mariner" that<br>the old crone spoke of.<br><br>Chesgard then set quil to parchment and sent a page with the letter to<br>the Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light. The page then was seen in<br>the hallways leaving "changing" from the visage of a young lad, to that<br>of a fair and beautiful high elf from whose lips could be heard, "soon<br>we will be together my love."<br><br>In the letter Chesgard also had become suspicious as to the dark<br>tidings, considering the re-emergence of the hate armies. The last time<br>such evils were soon were none other then the war of hate, around the<br>time of the battle of high keep. This was when the dead raised from<br>their graves in the hills and Varsoons decayed plague was wrought across the lands.<br><br>During this time Drayvar managed to temporarily ensnare the soul of<br>Hothrog, with the aid of the witch Najena. Zyac later used his rites to<br>unbind the soul of Hothrog from being bound in a Necromantic rite of<br>passage. During this time a few confrontations occured between Fist of<br>Hate and 1st Fist of Light, this only being one of them...not even<br>counting the endless taunting from the ranks of the Hate army.<br><br>Having the letter a scouting party sets out to Qeynos. Its believed by<br>Aikek and Linien that the "mariner" is none other then Captain Rohand<br>form the Mermaids Lure at the docs. This same Captain also speaks of<br>tales regarding the vampire Mayong Mistmoore not as a Teir Dal, but as a fallen high elf.<br><br>The party which then consisted of Banegrivm, Linien, Genieve, Hothrog,<br>Shaym, Mystican, Jarkari, and Raleldor Jax; a passing warrior who had<br>heard the tales of Qeynos's strife and offered his sword in the cause.<br>They maid their way the docs and found the Mermaids Lure and spoke with<br>the captain. In the midst of their conversation with Captain Rohand, a<br>gypsy spoke to Banegrivm and said "only he who is of open faith may<br>pass, what god do you follow?"<br><br>When Banegrivm answered the gypsy he was informed to "hail mister<br>bloodheart" deep within the catacombs. Shaym new immediately considering<br><br>her former past "who" exactly mister bloodheart was. He was none other<br>then the Lord of the Bloodsabres themselves, vile champions of<br>Bertoxxulous.<br><br>The scout group made their way into the sewers. After much searching<br>they discovered a secret door which led entry to the home of what was<br>thought to be just a temple of Bertoxxulous. As they entered the<br>ante-chamber a foul wind blew and what sounded like howling demons<br>filled the air.<br><br>As they entered in they saw twin shadow knights which guarded and entry.<br><br>Raleldor was able to pass deeper within, being a warrior without liege<br>to any faith. As he entered he saw not but a temple...but an entire<br>citadel of deep dank evil. He made his way to S'ragg Bloodheart and as<br>he hailed him...a shrill vile sound pierced the air as a demons tendril like wisps took the life of Hothrog within an instant.<br><br>Banegrivm gave the command for immediate retreat knowing there was know<br>hope of a frontal assault. They reformed and pulled back with the<br>knowledge that they had and an idea of the perils that lay ahead of<br>them. But now new questions remain. What do the followers of<br>Bertoxxulous have to do with those of Hate?<br><br>Later that same fatefull eve...Raleldor and Banegrivm discovered a<br>paladin of Mithaniel Marr amidst the ranks of of the Qeynos guards. This<br>struck odd considering as soon as he appeared he dissappeared and then<br>was found outside the Mermaids Lure. Even stranger is the fact that it<br>had been thought all the guards true to the Qeynos seal were followers<br>of Rodcet Nife. As the two spoke with Lieutenant Arathur, they were told<br>by him to seek out "Rolius" in the Hall of Truth. When the two traveled<br>there they were told by this knight to collect militia helms from the<br>fallen corrupt city guardsmen.<br><br>How odd a wayward knight of truth finds himself in Qeynos spreading the<br>word of Marr. How odd yet again a paladin who follows Marr is fated to<br>battle the arch enemy of the temple of life. But again...why? And how<br>does all this relate to the the rising hate armies. What will happen<br>next? Only time will tell...for assuredly war is coming...<br><br>OOC - all of this is the background storyline that will be leading to mass <br>guild conflict. Please contact <a href=mailto:banegrivm@aol.com>banegrivm@aol.com</a> for interest in the light <br>side armies or contact <a href=mailto:zyacdvarr@aol.com>zyacdvarr@aol.com</a> for joining the hate side armies.</BLOCKQUOTE>

More posts were made today on the Gameplay Board by Gordon Wrinn.  Here's the skinny:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049536.html"><b>Wizard Runes</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: We have two runes of Fulguration, both marked the same but for different spells.  We have two runes of Attraction - same issue.]</i><br> <br>We should probably mark these runes Azia and Beza and update the research text accordingly. I'll see what I can do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049524.html"><b>Solusek Ro Server</b></a><br>Several servers can make very logical cases for a split. The ones that we do will be based upon the need that presents itself. I have noticed a fairly large off-peak population on Solusek Ro, indicating many international players on that server, but that of course isn't peak usage, and isn't part of the problem. <br><br>Next week after we take care of the TZ/VZ ruleset issue, we'll look into further population balancing methods across the servers, starting first with the servers with the highest at-peak population. We'll talk more about our plans then.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049535.html"><b>Camping</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: If i want to sit at one spawn site and camp a npc anywhere in the freakin world,i should be allowed to do so.]</i> <br><br>But when it's the same people who are choosing to do that that go around to the boards and various gamesites declaring how EQ is boring, we have to ask why they choose to do that. <br><br>In general, we've found that a non-trivial population will take the quickest path possible to leveling, regardless of the tedium that that particular path might present. The way to avoid tedium is to see that risk and reward are in balance. If we give these solitary and stationary fast-spawns spawn-times equivalent to the level of the NPC, then doing the boring camp for hours on end isn't as quick as getting into an underutilized dungeon with a good group. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049538.html"><b>More on Karana Server Switches</b></a><br>We'll probably split it to one server, not several. It is problematic as you mention to do something along the lines of splitting 500 accounts to one server, and 500 to another. That said, if we do pick up 1000 people and move them to Saryrn or 7th (most likely possibilities), history has shown that only about 40% represent peak usage.

What on earth was the rationale behind giving them Charm Animal?]</i> <br><br>Basically, shaman had charm for a while after release. We then removed it from them and gave them Befriend animal instead, based on the idea that they are a nature type moreso than not. When going through checking caps on certain spells in preparation for the launch of Kunark, we discoverd that Befriend Animal wasn't capped like other charm spells. So we capped it, leaving shaman unable to charm a lot of things that they could. <br><br>Charm animal, the upgrade to Befriend, was given to them to give them a portion of that power back.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049369-2.html"><b>Skill Check on Tailoring: Robe of the Lost Circle</b></a><br>I agree that the skill check is a pain. Let me see what I can do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049424.html"><b>The View of a Warrior</b></a><br>BosDragon made some excellent points in this post. I recommend it as a good read.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049406.html"><b>Add New Corpse Recovery Commands</b></a><br>This issue comes up from time to time and as we've said, it is not a change that we are planning on pursuing at this time. When /corpse was introduced, it was put in to give people a way to get their corpse out of a wall or tree without requiring them to wait for customer-service assistance. The concept of "dragging" corpses around for people was not the original intent, however it did present another way for someone to interact with their fellow players, so we continued to allow the ability. <br><br>Conning people into giving consent and then stealing their belongings is a very quick way to get an account canceled. We can't however guarantee that the victim will get their equipment back in these cases. This is a risk, and is the only risk involved. Like so many other things in the game, if the risk of getting your stuff stolen is too great, don't /consent someone. Players are fully responsbile for who they choose to /consent. Yes, we will pursue and ban people taking advantage of people in this manner, but players need to bear some responsibility for the choices they make. <br><br>Do not consent someone who you do not trust.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049179.html"><b>More on Bannings</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: What is the official procedure for suspensions and bannings including what avenues of appeal do you have when you feel that you have been unfairly punished . Thankyou in advance for your time]</i> <br><br>It depends on the specific situation. <br><br>Depending upon what the person involved has done, there may or may not be a warning, or warnings issued prior to taking more severe action. <br><br>Suspensions are documented and approved by a Lead. Bans are documented and approved by the head GM. In either case, word of the action is sent to the email address of record, the one they set within the EQ account data interface. The appeal route is different for each instance and is explained in the email that informs them of the action. <br><br>I hope this answers everyone's questions. If you need more info, please let me know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049253.html"><b>Root Spell Series Not Fixed?</b></a><br>I checked entrapping, engorging, ensnaring, engulfing, and grasping last night. I didn't find any problem. <br><br>The defined problem that was fixed was the spell was breaking at the time that it hit. This is evident when the spell break message is printed before the "feet become entwined" or similar message. This did not occur in any of my tests. <br><br>The roots can still break quickly, and the occurance of that is not a bug as long as the break message occurs after the effect message.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049272.html"><b>A Court-System for Bannings</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why not have in game trials for those that are being banned.  GM's could send serverwide announcements with the name of the player pleading his case and randomly select people that are online asking them if they wish to be a juror.]</i> <br><br>I really don't think that people would go for the idea of other players (who are paying customers just like the accused) deciding their destiny. People often think that there is favoritism in the current system, I can only imagine that that feeling would be *supported* by doing something of this nature. Imagine it on a PvP server. <br><br>The entire disciplinary process needs to be held to the highest standard of integrity. That cannot be done by turning it into a public spectacle where popularity would often determine outcome. <br><br>I'd ask everyone to consider for a moment that we have *nothing* to gain, and everything to lose by banning someone unjustly. If we ban someone unjustly, we not only lose a good paying customer, but we lose everyone that could buy the game and play it based upon their recommendation. We also stand a good chance to lose current customers over the situation as well. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/046817.html"><b>Seven Player Groups Popping Up</b></a><br>It's a bug, and use of it is considered an exploit. We're looking into ways to fix it now. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048583.html"><b>Relaxed Stance for Female Models?</b></a><br>I'm checking to see if there's a bug or if the animations do not exist. And yes, we've heard of the female bard animation issue as well :)</UL>

Garthe has the following event announcement to share:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hear Ye, Hear Ye, the Freeport Tavern (Drunks) guild on the Morell-Thule <br>server will be hosting an event this Saturday June 10 at 9 PM EST.  It will <br>be held in West Freeport.  Registration for these events will start about an <br>hour before, so be sure to get inline about an hour before hand to register <br>unless you pre-register by email.<br><br>The events will happen as described below.<br><br>Our first event for the evening will be a newbies vs. Garthe match.  Any <br>people level 5 and under will register prior to the event with a Freeport <br>Tavern member near the Arena in West Freeport and must not be /anon.  Then <br>all the participants will enter the arena, and when told GO will attempt to <br>kill Garthe, he will be fighting back, so prepare for a death.  However, the <br>person who strikes the killing blow will win a Greater Lightstone!  We will <br>have 2 rounds of this event.  There is NO entrance fee for this event, <br>however Harm Touch users will be disqualified if it is used, and there will <br>be a cleric on hand to reverse HT effects. Spell casters are also allowed to <br>participate; however DoTs will be frowned upon.<br><br>The Second event will consist of Last Man Standing in the Arena.  We will <br>break people into level ranges and users must register with an appointed <br>guild member before participating.  All participants will enter the arena <br>and when told GO will try to kill everybody else in the arena.  The LAST <br>person standing will win a Greater Lightstone.  Second place winners will <br>win a Regular Lightstone.  This event will continue as long as we have <br>enough people for each level range.  This is also a free entrance.  Level <br>ranges are as follows:<br><br>1 to 4<br>5 to 7<br>8 to 11<br>12 to 15<br>16 to 19<br>20 to 23<br>24 to 27<br>Etc.<br><br><br>The Third event for the evening will be a Drunk Chase, also in West Freeport <br>and will start at the Gate.  Upon registration into this event, alcohol will <br>be given to the participant.  Just before starting each participant will <br>drink his or her alcohol when told. We will already have a runner somewhere <br>in West FP who will ALSO be drunk, and when told GO all people will run all <br>around West FP trying to find our guild runner, the first person to INSPECT <br>successfully will win a Greater Lightstone and the pot money.  There will be <br>a small entrance fee for this event that will be paid to the guild member <br>you register with.  The fees will follow this formula and FTD will not be <br>keeping any cuts:<br><br>Levels 1 to 5, 5gp<br>For each range after add an additional 5gold. (6-10 1pp, 11-15 1.5pp etc)<br><br>Registration for each of these events will be handled by a single person for <br>an event, a line will form in front of this person to easily register names. <br>  This will start at 8pm EST near the arena.  You may also PRE Register by <br>email gartheb@hotmail.com with your character name, level, and the event or <br>events you wish to participate in.  ONLY People registered will be eligible <br>for prizes.<br><br>If our supply of GLSs or LSs runs out, we may substitute a cash prize <br>instead.  Hopefully this won't happen though.<br><br>Alcohol will be given out to people as long as our supply lasts, but please <br>don't get greedy, we will have 1 or 2 people giving it out so it won't be <br>hard to remember names of people who ask for alcohol repeatedly.<br><br>This is the Freeport Tavern Drunks first event and we're hoping to have a <br>lot of fun!  Come out and enjoy yourself.  You can check out our website at <br><a href="http://ftdrunks.freeservers.com">http://ftdrunks.freeservers.com</a> for member info etc or for updated info on <br>this event.

I received the following letter from Zamzi:<BLOCKQUOTE>The Zek Lottery<br><br>As part of the upcoming changes on Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek<br>Here's what I propose I am willing to donate 100 pp and a Stein of Moggok to <br>kick start a lottery on what the Final Numbers will be at 10 PM EDT on the <br>first Saturday following the switch. The player who selects the number <br>closest to the number of players on Each server, without going over, will win <br>70% of the prize. The next closest will win 20 % of the donations and the <br>third closest will win 10 %. All items donated will be awarded to the first <br>place finisher. <br><br>De rulez. <br><br>Numbers are secured by response to this post. No entry fee. You must list <br>your character's name and your prediction in Tallon Zek / Vallon Zek Order. <br><br>Your predictions should be in 100 unit increments i.e. 100/3000 meaning 100 <br>players on Tallon 3000 players on Vallon. <br><br>Predictions will close at Noon (12PM EDT) the day before the switch. <br><br>One post per character per Eqvault screen name, we will filter screen the <br>name combos. So please don't abuse the fun with multiple postings. Also all <br>anonymous names will be deleted. <br><br>Award will be made at the first available opportunity that the winners and <br>Zamzi can find a quiet corner of the world and trade. For obvious reasons <br>there will be no "Awards Ceremony". <br><br>All rules are subject to change without notice. I have never run a lottery <br>before and if I have seriously overlooked something critical I will correct <br>it. <br><br>Additional prizes, I would like to develop this to be a little more worthy <br>prize wise but as a 22nd level guild less Shaman I don't have more to offer. <br>If you like this idea and can afford to bolster the prize total please post <br>your donation here and I will give an in game tell to arrange pick up. I <br>would love a friendly Wizzie to help with this step. All money and items <br>collected will be given out as prizes. I am not keeping any thing, only doing <br>this cuz it sounds like fun. (And even if it is a screaming success I will <br>not be called on to do something like it again, the event is just too unique) <br>Open posting keeps it all honest and on the up and up if a little cumbersome. <br><br>The primary goal of the lottery is to have some fun. The secondary goal is to <br>smoke out who knows their smack versus the tongue wagers who don't know <br>squat. The final goal is to encourage a healthy player base on Vallon Zek so <br>all prizes will be awarded there. So put your thinking cap on, and post your <br>prediction and we will see you back on the First Saturday Night following the <br>switch, 10PM EDT if you cannot play at that time we will post the results on <br>this thread. <br><br>Zamzi De Troll<br>Vallon Zek (and staying)</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

The following Patch Addendum is now being displayed on the Patch Server:<UL>June 6th, 7:00pm<br>-----------------<br><br>*Patch Addendum*<br><br>A few changes were not included in the patch message earlier today:<br><br>- Banshee Aura has had its duration increased.<br>- Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale will no longer be canceled by being the target of a melee attack. Ranged attacks and spells will still cancel the spell.<br>- Shaman can now cast Charm Animal<br>- Some enchanter and shaman spells have had their casting times/mana costs altered.<br>- Augment, Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture, and Clarity II have had their mana cost lowered.<br>- Root spells that cause damage (Druid roots, Hungry Earth) now work properly.<br><br>Additionally, NPCs now have a maximum amount that they can be slowed prior to being damaged.  This change should only affect users of the 54th level Bard song, which, when coupled with the bard "fear" song allowed them to stop fleeing NPCs completely, while rendering them unable to make any attacks.  <br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

One player charges that Verant is trying to do away with solo'ing in EQ altogether.  Gordon took the time to respond to this post.  Here's the scoop:<UL>Read the patch message. They noticed that those in a good class can gain exp much faster by not grouping and blasting static spawns, than take their chancesi n a group somewhere dangerous and get killed. So, instead of fixing the game to do what people obviously want to do, they're changing it so we have to play "their way" (see: the Vision(tm)). We made a stink about nerfing our classes, so they decided instead, to nerf the things we kill. Nice move. Hell with it, AC may suck hard, but I can solo as long as I want.<br><br><b><i>No Breuter, there's no intention here to "end" soloing, but what we have always said is that soloing should be a more difficult and longer path to advancement, even for those classes designed to be soloable. <br>These high level 6 minute static and solitary spawns make extended camping (which everyone agrees is boring) a preferred method for advancement.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Spotted on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049126.html">this thread</a> on the Gameplay Board.

The issue of speaking publicly about player bannings was raised again recently on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the first post followed by Gordon's:<UL>Perception.<br><br>It's all about perception.<br><br>In just the last few minutes, I've seen a couple of nasty stories about "unfair" bannings.<br><br>One about somebody who was given an item from a gm that he wasn't supposed to have. Maybe he should have questioned more about where the item come from, but did he know the other person was a gm? I honestly can't say I would have done anything different, looking a gift horse in the mouth and all, ESPECIALLY at a time when lots of people knew that drops in Kunark were much much better than they were supposed to be. (Ok, we didn't know they weren't supposed to be that way, but we did know they were much better than most things on the original continents)<br><br>A second story is about somebody who claims to use a spawn timing method that I actually thought was quite ingenious, using only the tools that are given to you in the game. (/time and the command history, available using shift-up) Maybe the person was using a packet pusher, maybe they weren't.<br><br>A third story is about somebody who ran around dragging a corpse behind them, probably using a hotkey for /corpse. (You did know you can do this, can't you?) Why provide the hotkeys if we're not meant to use them?<br><br>Yes, all of these stories could be incorrect, and surely they're only one side of the story, but you know what? If the people reading this board only can see one side of the story, and that side sounds reasonable (which in all three of these cases, they do), guess what people are going to believe?<br><br>If you have reasons to believe that the person with the timing method was using a third party program, then post them. If you have reasons to believe the person dragging their corpse was using a third party program, then post them.<br><br>Cause from the player's perspective, right now you're starting to look more and more like ogres. (no offense meant to those of the larger, uglier races)<br><br><b><i>I understand your opinion, but individual account issues will not be discussed in the court of public opinion. If the owner of the account wants to contact the Head GM and then post the communications, that is their choice to make those communications public. <br><br>People can say anything that they like here in public about why they were banned. Sure, we could get in here and argue each issue, but doing that would be fruitless. There is no information that could be placed on this board that someone couldn't claim was "manufactured", leaving the other side with no further avenue to argue the issue, and having the whole thing devolve into a case of "Yes you did/No I didn't". <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Some unannounced changes were made to the Bard class.  Here's the original post and Gordon's response from the Gameplay Board:<UL>Yes once again bards get a stealth nerf. This time they have nerfed both out lvl 23 song (Selo's Consonant Chain) and our lvl 54 song (Selo's Assonait Strane). Chains used to stop feared mobs at 50% health. Very useful for tight fights when the healer is OOM. Strane used to stop full health mobs when feared when played with a magic lute. Now they do not.<br><br>Chains is the worse nerf of the two. It is a mainstay of every bards song list after 23rd level. To have the movement portion of this song changed, WITH NO WARNING, is typical.<br><br>I am too pissed to write anymore at the moment. This is just sad.<br><br><b><i>Ack, yes, I meant to announce this.<br><br>Basically, NPCs now have a maximum amount that they can be slowed down without being damaged. <br><br>There was a particular exploit where two bards could get together, play this song (the level 54 one), and the Fear song, and any NPCs in the effect range would stop dead in their tracks and not fight back when being killed. <br><br>I'll announce it in the addendum that I'll post shortly.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Here's the latest from Gordon Wrinn from off the pages of the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049084.html"><b>Karana Server</b></a><br>We're looking into options for Karana now. Whether that will entail bringing up a new split server, or splitting people off to one of the 4 existing underutilized servers we won't know until about the middle of next week. <br><br>We also have a situation with Bertox again due to the sort-order defaulting to alpha order for the past few weeks. It now defaults to ordering by population, but Bertox got a fairly large influx of players over that period.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049091.html"><b>Hybrid Spells</b></a><br>They are indeed intentionally set to levle 55. All of the hybrid spells put in today are level 55 spells.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049099.html"><b>Walking Through Doors</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I saw a post about the mobs being able to walk thru doors thing.. Think you could dedicate some of that free time and not make mobs play by rules that we cant play by]</i><br> <br>Well mobs can't exactly go track down a rogue to open the door for them. And they aren't as intelligent as the average player. They therefore get some special advantages to remain competitive. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049080.html"><b>The Clipping Plane</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Congratulations Verant! You fixed the clipping plane by COMPLETELY BREAKING IT....]</i><br><br>We didn't make any changes to the clipping plane functionality, just made sure the tolerances were set to the maximum levels in zone headers (where zone-specific data is stored). <br><br>Did it happen to be raining when you were testing it?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049050.html"><b>Two Quick Questions Answered</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Quick two questions: First off... why does a combine dagger cost less than a fine steel? A combine dagger in North Karana costs around 36pp, with a fine steel costing 48pp.... any comments on that?]</i> <br><br>Fine steel weapons sell at a large premium on vendors because we prefer that players trade amongst themselves for the weapons. It's basically to spur the economy on. We really wouldn't expect that anyone would actually pay for a fine steel weapon from a vendor considering the price. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Second, is there any place to submit ideas for new quests? I've got a few ideas on them....]</i> <br><br>/feedback in game is a good idea at the moment. Soon we'll be publicizing some email addresses for quest ideas as well as one to help players coordinate events that require GM assistance. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049012.html"><b>PvP</b></a><br>Player classes are not balanced in terms of PvP offensive power. What I mean by this is that we didn't throw each class in a pit and hold one on one battles in some effort to create equality. Classes are balanced primarily for Player versus Environment (PvE). <br><br>We've had to make a few changes to the way things work in PvP in order to deal some balance issues that pop up. For example, in PvP, spells do 2/3rds damage versus another player. This is because the spells are designed to be effective versus NPCs, and are much too strong versus players who often have far less hitpoints than an equalently leveled NPC. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049023.html"><b>Patch Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Ok, I have three small issues with the new patch. First, didn't you say the Druid root series would be fixed? We've been waiting FOREVER.]</i> <br><br>Yes, it's in today. I'll post it in the patch message addendum. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Secondly you said, "Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different than they actually are. This includes all racial illusions, as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series." How many times have you told us that wolfform/treeform ARE NOT illusions?]</i> <br><br>From an RP standpoint, they are not illusions. From a programming standpoint, they are handled the same way. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: And lastly, you said, "there are many cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk." How do you figure? Any time you attack a creature there is risk, not to mention a single spawn will not give you the XP/loot that a good dungeon group will.]</i> <br><br>And example of a "fast spawn" is something that spawns much faster than a critter in a dungeon at a similar level would. For example, a level 40 critter spawning every 6 minutes would be a "fast spawn". Now if this spawn is stationary and solitary, the risk is reduced tremendously. That's what I was trying to point out. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Quit trying to NERF everything]</i> <br><br>We've still made far more enhancements to the game that people would consider generally positive in nature than we have made ones that they'd consider negative. Regardless of how people view the change, we feel that they are in the best interest of the game overall. <br><br>For example, in regards to those fast spawns, people will often sit there and camp them for hour after hour, doing an admitedly boring and repetitive task because they view it to be "faster". In the mean time, they are bored to death. Our goal in these cases is to make doing more exciting things, such as fighting in a dungeon, "faster". This way people are having fun while leveling up instead of being bored from camping one creature for hours. That's the goal anyway.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048984.html"><b>Warruirs & Stun</b></a><br>Yes, kicks with an integral chance to stun are indeed an ability gained by warriors post-50. I have not though commented on what level the ability is gained.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048977.html"><b>Why wasn't the weight on the Tranquil Staff reduced?</b></a><br>Some of the weapon weights are intentional. I will check to insure that they got all of the ones that were mistaken, but the tranquil staff is one of those that is meant to be very heavy (monk-wise anyway). It's an incredibly powerful weapon and needed a pretty substantial drawback.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048974.html"><b>Security Breach on Rallos Zek?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I am reposting this issue from the ralloszek.net OOC forum. It involves a former abusive player on Rallos Zek who has close personal ties with Brad McQuaid and has since become a Lead-GM on Rallos Zek. This issue transcends the coin loot issue and leads credence to a true conspiracy.]</i><br> <br>First, lets get off this idea that any time something happens that is questionable that the people involved must have "close personal ties with Brad McQuaid". No one working here has close enough personal ties with anyone that they would put the integrity of the game at risk. <br><br>That said, this is a coincidence. With several million characters in existence, it was only a matter of time before a GM begining work here chose a name that had some history on a particular server. When things of this nature happens, we investigate the issue to insure that integrity is maintained. We're having the GM choose a new name since this one evidently caused quite a stir on Rallos. <br><br>Furthermore I should mention that that particular GM isn't the GM for Rallos. He was just in the process of creating his GM name across all of the servers when he was spied in the /who list. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: On my origional post on this topic, a Verant emploee with the screen name Verant_Thom agreed to look into this.  Does anyone know who this is in the Verant Hierarchy?]</i><br><br>He's the Customer Service Manager for EverQuest. Jeff Butler was promoted to the position of Producer of EQLive back in March.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048965.html"><b>Posion Components</b></a><br>It's too soon for me to say how many of the existing components will continue to be usable with the new recipies. One of the guys was creating a bunch of new components yesterday and is putting the new recipies together. Assuming that we follow the same logic as before with the Alchemy revamp, existing poisons should continue to be makeable, but new ones will probably require new components. I really need to sit down with the designer before I'll be able to comment intelligently though, which I probably won't do until the new system has been approved.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048807-2.html"><b>Lock Door Explotation?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: What is the position of GMs on it? Is it allowed? Or is it a bannable offense?]</i> <br><br>It's not considered illegal at present, but more of a design consequence. In any case, I don't think that it is as reliable as having a rogue there to open the door for you. <br><br>We've been considering a few different options to eliminate this issue. One would be for all NPCs to walk through doors without opening them, like it was in beta. This looks bad though. We've got a couple other ideas that we are thinking about as well. <br><br>Does anyone feel that this is an issue that needs attention? In other words, do you feel that these are reliable enough options as to decrease the importance of rogues?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048893.html"><b>Fix the Howling Harpoon!</b></a><br>We are aware of this problem. We're still trying to decide what spell-effect to put on it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048937.html"><b>GMs Playing on the Same Server?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: It has come to my attention that we have a new Lead-Admin GM on Rallos Zek named Temporalis. I find it rather curious this GM is the same name, race, class, and gender of a player from the early days on Rallos. <br>More to the point, I find it troublesome that this person was a guild leader of Bane of the Living....one of the earliest PK guilds (not PvP...PK). This person left the server after being hunted again and again by any number of guilds out there. <br>Would you, Verant, please reassure us on Rallos Zek that you have not placed someone in an administrative position for our server that might hold grudges against players there?]</i><br><br>This is a coincidence. With several million characters in existence, it was only a matter of time before a GM begining work here chose a name that had some history on a particular server. When things of this nature happens, we investigate the issue to insure that integrity is maintained.

As you are not a usual poster to the boards Verant_Thom, could I ask who you are?....Position wise if not by name. It is reassuring to have an idea who we are speaking with.]</i> <br><br>Thom is the Customer Service Manager for EverQuest. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048480.html"><b>Bumping It</b></a><br>There are a lot of posts on the board here that people "bump" quite often in hopes of getting some sort of response. Though persistence is commendable, sometimes the content of the post where the response is being demanded isn't really something that I like to respond to. <br><br>Posts from people who want an armor item with a specific look are not infrequent here on the boards.

Gordon <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048978.html">announced</a> some new stealth enhancements today on the Gameplay Board a few hours ago:<UL><i>This morning I was handed a list of spell changes that didn't make it into the patch message. I'll put up an addendum later today, but here's the list for review:<br><br>* Banshee Aura has had its duration increased.<br>* Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale will no longer be canceled by being the target of a melee attack. Ranged attacks and spells will still cancel the spell.<br>* Shaman can now cast Charm Animal<br>* Some enchanter and shaman spells have had their casting times/mana costs altered.<br>* Augment, Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture, and Clarity II have had their mana cost lowered.<br>* Root spells that cause damage (Druid roots, Hungry Earth) now work properly.<br><br>-Gordon</i></uL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Today's Patch Message is now live.  Here's a complete copy of it:<UL>June 6th, 8:00am<br>-----------------<br><br><b>*Patch Day*</b><br><br>Greetings! The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest data on the Test Server:<br><br><b>*General*</b><br><br>- Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes.  Check your Kunark spell vendors.<br>- Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths upon zoning.  The majority of these issues should no longer occur.<br>- Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.<br>- Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle, Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.<br>- Upon review we've increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in Kunark.  They should be more plentiful now. <br>- Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets and other NPCs to get around the zones.<br><br><b>*Items*</b><br><br>- A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword.  Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their sword out for a working one.<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your possession when you leave the game.<br>- A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight.<br>- Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark.<br><br><b>*PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions*</b><br><br>Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently mesmerize or stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, illusions will now automatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion casts an offensive spell upon any player-character.  Players should keep this in mind before attacking with spells in an area where their faction standing is less than desirable.  <br><br>Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different than they actually are.  This includes all racial illusions, as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series.  <br><br><b>*Risk and Reward*</b><br><br>The concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of EverQuest.  Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should also provide substantial risk.  Over the past several weeks, we've been identifying areas in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and making necessary adjustments. <br><br>In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward for a specific action.  For example, we recently increased the experience awarded in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk associated with adventuring there.  We also do this quite frequently by increasing the reward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as we did last week with the Burning Rapier quest.  <br><br>However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess of the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those above as we come across them.  For example, there are many cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk.  <br><br>Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we did want to let you know that you will see risk/reward disparities corrected over the next several weeks.<br><br><b>*PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers*</b><br><br>As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP combat.  Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item from the fallen, whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.<br><br>Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek post-production, we've decided to allow characters on both servers a one-time character-move.  Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT on Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm PDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000.  You can register for the move by executing the "/movelog yes" command during the registration window.  There is no limit to the number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and Vallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<br><br>Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can not be rescinded.  The actual character-move will take place sometime next week, at a time to be announced later.  Please keep in mind that corpses are not moved in a character-move, so we'd recommend against leaving unclaimed corpses around after Monday of next week if you've asked to be moved. <br><br>Questions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay Message Forum available via www.everquest.com.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Kolath!

Banegrivm brings us the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>It all started one fatefull day when followers of both light and dark gods amassed for a battle of epic proportions that would never be forgotten. It was a time when Norrath needed heroes, where villains rued the day, the gates of hate opened wide, and a legacy was born. An army of light stood to defend the gates of High Keep from an assault led by Innoruuks daughter. The army of light stood victorious as Lanys had been cast into hate, and the heads of Teir Dal lined the <br>gates of high keep.<br><br>Sometime later the standard that had valiantly defended high keep sailed once more; enter the 1st Fist of Light. Within the confines of Neriak there had been a <br>stir, orders issued, and a crest of hate and retribution vile was raised; enter the Fist of Hate.<br><br>Now the war of hate that had once been is reborn. Sides have been drawn and the story unfolds once more. Brave heroes and villains fight on a battlefield to <br>determine the fate of Norrath. <br><br>Rumors scourge the taverns across fair Norrath from bards aglib with tales of woe and the heroic fray. Are the Bloodsabres secretly in league with the newly reborn hate armies. Is Commander Kane finally preparing for his tyrannical reign of Qeynos? Will the hate armies have the sacred ore they seek from the bowels of <br>high keep at long last? All this and more to come...as the War of Hate has returned at long last.<br><br>For all those interested in joining the hate war on the sides of the light armies contact <a href="mailto:Banegrivm@aol.com">Banegrivm@aol.com</a> and for those interested in the hate army contact <a href="mailto:zyacdvarr@aol.com">zyacdvarr@aol.com</a>.<br><br>Guildwar switches WILL be thrown on a mass scale by ALL guilds involved on both sides and any and all guilds interested in the event are openly welcomed and encouraged to take part.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Banegrivm!
