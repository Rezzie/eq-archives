Jeannette brings us the following announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>***Blackburrow Triage Event**<br><br>&#8220;BAAARRRRRRRKKKKK!&#8221;<br><br>It was a familiar howling cry that ripped through the Qeynos night.  Zsalshun stood up and waited for the inevitable as the howl of the hunt bounced off the stone walls of the city.  In the dark there were cries of pain as the pack tore through the young adventurers, even as the guards rushed out to slay the encroaching  dogs.  The priestess called upon the powers of her dark god to help the unfortunates in the way of the reckless charge but still some were lost.  The guard came back to his post with the fire of hate burning in his eyes.<br><br>&#8220;Those Darkpaws grow ever bolder and we don&#8217;t have the manpower to exterminate them in that black den of theirs!&#8221; <br><br>The Tier &#8216;Dal priestess cast her dark lord&#8217;s protections on a recently mauled fighter and sent him healed and on his way.  The citizens had come to tolerate her and on occasions such as this even respect the power granted to her by Innoruuk.<br><br>&#8220;These gnolls have taken quite a bite out of the citizens here.  I think it might be time for the citizens to start taking back.&#8221;  The priestess raised an eyebrow at the guard.  He looked at her uncertainly.<br><br>&#8220;Their den is a hive of traps and they are as thick as Inkies in Neriak in there.  No offense.&#8221;<br><br>Zsalshun sighed and thought a bit.  &#8220;House Winterborne can provide protection and aid to the townsfolk.  That might help and I am sure there are several young adventurers who are looking for revenge on these dogs.  We have healers, casters and respectable warriors who can insure a margin of safety for an all out assault.&#8221;  She tapped a finger absently on her mace.  &#8220;Yes, I think that with our help, the citizens of Qeynos can finally charge into Black Burrow and take back some of which the gnolls have taken.&#8221;<br><br>The guard smiled grimly.  &#8220;I wish you all the luck.  May the gods smile on your plans.&#8221;<br><br><br>OOC:  Monday, October 2nd at 8:30 EST  House Winterborne of the Xegony server will be providing aid for any adventurer wanting to assault the Darkpaw gnolls in their home of Blackburrow.  We shall  assist those in Blackburrow by healing, buffing, providing bandages, food and drink as well as the esteemed services of our warriors for train breaking.  We invite you to come spend an evening stopping the gnoll scourge at the starting point:  Their own home den.  We have no delusions that the gnolls will be exterminated, but for one evening we can definitely help with the thinning of their ranks. </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Over the next several days, the peak population will drop off to a level of around 1300 or so, at which time we'll be turning the server "green".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019178.html"><b>Default Settings for Resizable Windows</b></a><br>There isn't a simple command to do this at the moment, but you could open your EQCLIENT.INI and delete all of the screen configuration entries. I'll talk to Rowyl about the possibility of a /screendefault command. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019144.html"><b>Statistics and Numbers</b></a><br>Wow, warriors outnumber druids. That's impressive.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019121.html"><b>Escaping to New Server</b></a><br>How do you know they did it to escape from Twinks? Following any new server being brought up, there's always a bunch of people that flock to them. This dies off in a couple of days and the population stabilizes. I'm sure that everyone has their reasons for going, but what makes you think it's all about twinking?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019116.html"><b>New Server at Peak Hours</b></a><br>I assume you mean Kelethin. In any case, it hardly mattered when the server came up. It would have been crowded. It happens every time a server comes up. If you find it unplayable, you might want to wait a couple of days for the population to stabilize. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019110.html"><b>Shared Account Issues</b></a><br>Unfortunately Zacheus, we've been unable to come up with a way of verifying *for certain* that the characters wouldn't actually be changing hands, so it's not something that we can pursue at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019087.html"><b>Res Nerf?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Second hand info.

Here's the most recent posts from Gordon Wrinn as posted on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019097.html"><b>New Server Population</b></a><br>New servers always get an influx of people way above the norm. It takes a few days for population to stabilize. I was just looking at the counts by zone, Gfay was leading with 389 :)<br>--<br>Actually only 300 players total on the new server were druids last time I looked.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019065.html"><b>Movable Window Suggestion</b></a><br>This is on our list for possible future enhancements. Thanks by the way :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019039.html"><b>Today's Patch</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Well, it's patch day yet again. It's a good thing, bugs are fixed, content is added, and other generally positive changes are made. Patch is announced ahead of time and an ETA is given on when the servers will be back up. Then..... Silence... Patch goes over the posted time frame one hour... two.... three.... STILL no update on server status on the website]</i></font> <br><br>To my knowledge, this patch went only 15 minutes over the scheduled time, meaning that there'd really be no point to a status update. <br><br>Now there is always login congestion following patches. This is unfortunately not feasibly avoidable, as login traffic is many times normal load during this time. I suppose that we could automatically put up a banner explaining this each time, but that'd really only be useful to the brand new players, as everyone else is already aware of these issues.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019059.html"><b>Will Tholuxe Paells be a split server?</b></a><br>No, we don't split people off to "new character only" servers like Tholuxe. Some were once moved from Test to Morrel, but that was a mistake and they were later moved off. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018972.html"><b>Buying Whole Stacks</b></a><br>There's no need to convince us that this is a change that needs to be made. We already agree :)  While we understand the desire for this functionality, some things are quicker, easier, or more important to do than others. We'll get it in, just please be patient.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018757.html"><b>Cleric Quest</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "id much rather spend 2 hours each on say 10 or 12 items for 1 stage of the quest than sit under a lake for 23 hours watching goblins spawn."<br><br>I think we ALL would Woundweaver.]</i></font> <br><br>As I've mentioned before, the 10-12 step quest with 2 hours required for each step allows items into the world at the rate of one every two hours. We do not want any of these items to be that common.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018732.html"><b>NPCs and PCs</b></a><br>NPCs do not not collide with PCs due to AI limitations and potential balance problems. I understand your assertion that from a real-world perspective it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, however from a gameplay perspective it is necessary. <br><br>NPCs already have to calculate the best route to a target around world geometry and switches. It would be another matter entirely for them to try to also calculate the way around dynamic objects within the world. <br><br>So, as foreseen by Lostalus, NPCs can do things that PCs cannot. This is discussed further in the FAQ.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018406.html"><b>Customer Relations</b></a><br>I appreciate where you are coming from Jochomo, however there are a number of things that I don't think that we can agree on. <br><br>First is that its been shown in the past that the more in-depth an explanation in attempt to get buy-in, the less buy-in we get. Threads quickly devolved into arguments over each point, each of which expect those arguments to be addressed in the same fashion. Second is that sometimes the information you are requesting is information that we'd never release. It might be something that's internal information that will never be made public, or perhaps its something dealing with mysteries of the game. Finally, a lot of the time it is an opinion. Facts and formula can back not everything up. For instance, I saw of thread the other day asking why halflings couldn't be rangers. There's no formula that will answer that question. The answer is that our opinion is that they shouldn't be rangers, and is as simple as that. <br><br>We're not going to break things down to a scientific certainty in all, or even many of the cases. We won't post our logs, or snippets of code. We'll certainly make every attempt to explain the things that we can, however please remember that this is a service that we provide, and that you choose to purchase based upon the merits of what we provide. Simply, sometimes "no" is the best answer we can give. Going into a dissertation on all of the reasons why the answer is "no" every time it comes up gives the impression that we're willing to change our minds if sufficient counter-arguments are presented. Sometimes this *is* the case, and other times it's not. We're fairly open about it when we're willing to debate matters further. <br><br>For example, if someone posts here on the board that Ice Comet is broken, because it should do 200pts more damage, what should our answer be? Do we need to lay out a matrix of all of the spells and try to justify scientifically that its current damage level is appropriate? Or do we just say "No, it shouldn't" or "No, it's working as intended". <br><br>I used to work for a company that developed highly expensive customized software for a relatively small customer-base (around 100). Certainly, when customers would request new functionality, we'd fly out to their location, and bend over backwards to implement the functionality for them in order to keep getting their yearly 6-figure support and license fees. There was no such thing as something that we couldn't do. It's a great way to do business, and leads to customers being very satisfied. <br><br>The last company I worked for built moderately expensive, highly configurable software for a customer base of around 1500. Here, we would not fly out to customer sites, but would certainly meet with them if they came in or talk to them on the phone if they called. We'd keep their suggestions for new functionality on a list, and implement as we could. If there was something that we couldn't do, we'd make a good effort to explain why, however it wasn't the same case as above where there was nothing that we couldn't do. <br><br>However, here, we're dealing with 300K customers, who all have their own ideas as to what the product should do. In this case, we cannot afford to take suggestion from them all, and completely justify our decisions every time we decline to implement suggested functionality. <br><br>It's all a matter of scale. Though the extent that we explain things varies depending on the issue, we&#8217;ll generally explain them to the point that we feel that there is something to be gained through the depth of the explanation. That often changes as the issue comes up over and over again. The melee binding issue, for instance, was explained and debated in great detail shortly after I came on board, but now it&#8217;s a simple &#8220;No&#8221;. <br><br>As for other issues, we&#8217;ll see as they come up :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018335.html"><b>Binding</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Casters bind anywhere except Kunark dungeons. This is a bug. Originally casters were supposed to self bind ONLY in towns.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not sure where this is coming from, as I've seen it posted several times, but it was not the original intent for casters to be able to bind only in towns. <br><br>Now they were not supposed to be able to bind in dungeons, so that much is a bug, but any non-dungeon location was to be fair game. Though it is technically a bug, it's one that we've waived, so it essentially becomes part of the game.</UL>

Brad reminisced about days gone by, namely EverQuest beta, in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018611.html">following response he posted</a> to the Gameplay Board:<UL>Out of curiosity, back in Beta, I recall Verant saying that there was an employee of Verant who was had a warm spot for musicians and bards. Who was that person and do they still work at Verant?<br><br><b><i>You bet! Steve Clover, one of the original two designers of the game and bard lover is a programmer for EQ Live.<br><br>And, if I might persue a tangent...<br><br>One of the really cool things about this place and EQ is that almost all of the original EQ team are still working on EQ related projects. Out of like 30 plus people who were originally involved I think maybe 3 or 4 at most have left to pursue other interests.<br><br>Which is, of course, very cool because the original creativity and talent is still with us going foward. Couple that with all of the new talent we've brought on board since then, and the fact that we've also got original UO team members working here (for example, Raph Koster), and you have, IMHO, one heck of an MMOG company <br><br>-Brad</i></b></UL>

Today's message is now up on the EverQuest Patch Server:<UL>September 28th, 7:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br><b>***Patch Day***</b><br><br>The following changes have been implemented on the production servers as part of today's patch:<br><br><b>*General Changes*</b><br><br>- NPC corpses level 55 or over will now last 30 minutes before decaying.  This should help those on large multi-group encounters who need some prep-time before looting items.<br>- The item "Woe" has been repaired.  If you receive the "Item out of charges" message when your "Woe" attempts to fire its spell, please contact a GM to trade out the item.<br>- The spell "Mark of Karn" has been changed.  The recast-time has been reduced significantly and the Hitpoint-return is now scaled inversely based upon the delay of the weapon.  In addition, a hitpoint return will only take place when the target is hit with a primary melee weapon, or the primary hand if you are unarmed.<br>- Some more tradeskill component vendors have been placed within the world to make certain tradeskills easier to use in your home town.<br>- "AFK" and "LD" status will now be reported above player's heads.<br><br><b>*Fleeing NPCs*</b><br><br>Last week's patch caused NPCs to flee more than before due to a bug that was fixed.  After evaluating the situation, we decided to reduce the chance to flee, but not to the extent that it was reduced before.  NPCs were previously much more "brave" than they should have been.<br><br>As part of the same change, charmed NPCs also began fleeing when low on health.  We've determined that this is not a good situation for the players.  As such, we have stopped charmed creatures from fleeing per player request.<br><br><b>*Level 1 Character Purge*</b><br><br>The Level 1 character purge has been completed.  All level 1 characters that have not been played within the past 30 days have been deleted.<br><br><b>*New Server Active*</b><br><br>Tholuxe Paells, a new server open to new characters only, is now active and ready for play.  Enjoy!  As a reminder, /movelog registration will take place on Mithaniel Marr and Tunare Friday evening from 6PM to Midnight (PDT: GMT-7).  Registered characters will be moved to a second new server, Drinal, early next week.<br><br><b>***User Interface Changes***</b><br><br>Many UI enhancements were made in today's patch:<br><br><b>*Moving and Resizing Windows*</b><br><br>The data windows in the full screen "HUD" mode may now be moved by clicking in the upper left-hand corner, moving them to where you want, then clicking again.  The "spell effect" and "chat" windows can be resized by clicking on the lower right-hand corner, dragging to the appropriate size, and then clicking again.  Coordinates for window locations in each resolution are stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br><b>*Bugs with Several Commands Fixed*</b><br><br>We fixed a problem with /book, /sit, and /doability that allowed them to be executed at inappropriate times, such as while charmed or feared.  They should now only function when the native button would have functioned if pressed.<br><br><b>*Miscellaneous Additions*</b><br><br>Added the following /-commands:<br><br>- /camp: Causes your character to camp out.  You must be sitting to use /camp.<br>- /disband: Will disband you from your current group, or turn down an invitation to join another group.<br>- /invite:  Will invite the target into a group, or accept an invitation if one is pending.<br>- /attack: Will toggle the state of "Auto-attack".  You may also add a parameter of "on" or "off" to explicitly set the state.<br><br>In addition:<br><br>- CTRL-1 through CTRL-8 will cast the spell in the specified spell-slot.<br>- ":" (colon: Short for /emote) and "'" (apostrophe: Short for /say) will now bring up the chat line in the same fashion as the /-key and ENTER.<br>- The "R" key (by default) takes you into reply-mode as always, bringing up a reply to the last person sending you a /tell.  However, you can now TAB and SHIFT-TAB to cycle through the last 10 people that have sent you /tells. <br><br>*Pauses in Socials*<br><br>You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).  <br><br>For example, a social consisting of:<br><br>/sit off<br>/cast 1<br>/pause 100<br>/sit on<br><br>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br><br>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line.<br><br>For example:<br><br>/sit off<br>/pause 100,/cast 1<br>/sit on<br><br>...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and MUST be specified first on the line.  <br><br><b>*Emote Codes*</b><br><br>The @ symbol has been replaced with a series of %-codes that expand into various pieces of information, and now works in ALL chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild). <br><br>The new %-codes are: <br><br>%T - Returns the current target.<br>%S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).<br>%O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).<br>%P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).<br>%R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).<br><br>For example, if you have a target of "a gnoll", the following emote:<br><br>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O.<br><br>...Your character will execute the "point" animation with a text output of "CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill it."<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

The RPGVault recently <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/features/interviews/bmcquaid.shtml">interviewed Verant's Brad McQuaid</a>.  The major subjects dealt with in this article are communities, the future of the genre, Brad's job and more.  Here's a clip:<UL><b>Jonric: It's hard to talk about attracting more players without discussing community. What does that word mean to you? How important are community and community building for an online world? What are the essential factors in successful community building, and what are the main obstacles and pitfalls? </b><br><br><b>Brad McQuaid:</b> Community is relationships between players, whether it be friendly or adversarial, symbiotic or competitive. It's also a form of persistence, which is key to massively multiplayer games. Without community, you simply have a bunch of independent players running around the same environment. Players won't be drawn in and there won't be anything there to bind them. <br><br>The key to creating community, therefore, is interdependence. In EverQuest, we forced interdependence in several ways and although we've been criticized for it, I think it's one of a couple of reasons behind our success and current lead. By creating a class-based system, players NEED each other. By creating an environment often too challenging for a solo player, people are compelled to group and even to form large guilds and alliances. All of this builds community, and it all keeps players coming back for more and more. <br><br>The hurdles are basically anything that interferes with this building, which is why communication is key. Global messaging, different channels, and other functionality found in sophisticated chat programs is very important. Also, finding additional ways to bind people together is challenging. As MMORPGs move beyond focusing on only adventure, other means of interdependence will need to be found. For example, Ultima Online does a fantastic job of building community with both its trade skill system and also with player run vendors and towns. </UL>

There we will be publicizing EQ storyline, including that surrounding dynamic events/quests that you may have missed in game.

Gordon talked about NPCs fleeing in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018596.html">following thread he started on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>Last week while optimizing code, one of the programmers fixed a variable initilization problem that resulted in the fixing of a bug that had been around a long time in regards to when NPCs decide to flee. As a result of this, NPCs became much more likely to flee in combat. The response to this has been mixed, with roughly an equal number of people on both sides of the issue.<br><br>Now that the problem was fixed, we've reevaluated the the bravery code and determined that they flee too often now. As such, that potential to flee will be reduced in tomorrow's patch, though they will still flee more than they did before.<br><br>That said, the same change also had a decidedly negative effect: Charmed creatures began fleeing. I think everyone can agree that this part of it was pretty well objectionable, so we're going to stop charmed creatures from fleeing.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Yakatizma made a couple of posts recently on the Coalition of Tradesfolks Board.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/001033.html">post #1 on Bards and imbue issue</a>:<UL>I don't play on test, so I don't know if this is in or not yet, but will bards receive an imbue spell for Veeshan? It's looking like every deity is receiving an imbue spell, but only bards can worship Veeshan (and I'd estimate about 30% of bards that have a deity worship her). <br><br>So anyways, I was wondering if their were plans to add a bardic imbue song (that would function along similar lines to identify. Non-continuous, hold the item to be imbued on your cursor). It would seem kinda mean to leave all the Veeshan worshippers out of the loop as far as the imbued / cultural armors go (specially since you can only wear cultural armors that match your deity).<br><br><b><I>I'm working out a way for bards to get Veeshan imbued stones.</b></i></UL>Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000965.html">bit #2 on recipes</a>:<UL>Adamantite Ogre War Plate Chain Jointing recipes?<br><br>I have tried 1 large Adamanite Brick, File, and Neriak Nectar, and I get the does not combine message! This is the posted recipes I have seen.<br>Does anyone have a correct recipes they know work for the Ogre War Plate in the Oggok forge?<br><br>I understand you have to make Adamanite Rings first ,then use the rings to make the Adamanite Chain Jointing.. <br><br><b><i>Checked and repaired.

Yes I am aware that Regeneration was added to the Phantom line even prior to RoK, but why?, is my question.]</i></font> <br><br>We wanted the Phantom armor series to be useful to the mages. We didn't want to resort to increasing AC as in order to make it useful in that regard, the AC value would have had to be more than those of other classes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018208.html"><b>Closing Threads</b></a><br>I'm sorry cthon, but we need to encourage new ideas here on the board rather than revisiting the old ones over and over like a skipping record. We have these boards because they are a benefit to us. They can only be a benefit to us if they are a benefit to the players, which is the same thing. These boards cannot be a benefit to the players if we're constantly stuck in neutral. The point that they cease to benefit the players they cease to benefit us and they will be closed down. Let's see that that doesn't happen.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018184.html"><b>Starting Out on New Server</b></a><br>You must be quite the adventurer Azrael! <br><br>Though I wish you well on your journey, I might remind you that it will be some time before anyone will be capable of binding you. Though I think that it's possible for you to make the entire trip once, a few newbie deaths before anyone can bind could make things difficult.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018180.html"><b>Abashi Biased?</b></a><br>I knew this would come up. I almost put a disclaimer at the bottom explaining that more classes than the necro have fear spells, and that the suggested problem is pretty black and white making it a simple test, but I thought better of it. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018183.html"><b>Necros</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why isn't this game called "letsseehowlongittakestogeteveryonetostartanecroQuest" ]</i></font><br><br>Because in order to get all of that on the front of the box, the font would have to be so small that no one could read it. <br><br>Seriously though, yes, necros are powerful in their way. So are enchanters, and clerics, and warriors, and rogues, and a bunch of other classes. They are all "powerful" in their own way. <br><br>I'd agree that necros were too powerful if they were displacing other classes in their own bailiwick, which isn't happening.</UL>

Looks like a new message went up on the Patch Server yesterday.  Here it is for those that missed it:<UL>*Level 1 Character Purge*<br><br>The Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take place on Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7).  Any level 1 characters that haven't been played within the previous 30 days will be deleted.  If you wish to keep any level 1 characters that you may have, please log in and play them between now and 9/27.  <br><br><br>September 25th, 6:00pm<br>------------------------------<br><br>*New Servers*<br><br>We're pleased to announce that we are bringing up two new servers in the near future. <br><br>Tholuxe Paells will be a server for new characters only (no moves) and will be brought up following the patch this Wednesday.  Drinal will be a split server, initially accepting characters from Mithaniel Marr and Tunare.  We may open /movelog registrations for other servers in the future as system-load allows.<br><br>Registration for the move (via "/movelog yes") will take place on Friday, September 29th between 6PM PDT (GMT-7) and 12AM. You must be in game and run the command if you wish to be moved.  As a reminder, no special arrangements are made to keep guilds or groups together in the transition. If too many people execute the command to take them all, it is possible that some might get left behind. Also, any corpses left in the world at the time the actual split takes place will not follow you to the new server. The time of the split will be publicized on the "Scheduled Downtime" page at www.everquest.com.<br><br>One final note: There is a potential problem with the /movelog command when issued by hundreds of people at one time.  We highly recommend that you wait at least 15 minutes after registration opens prior to using the command. If you have any concerns that your command may not have gone through, you can zone and repeat the command if you wish.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Be sure that you have the proxy set up to allow UDP above 1024. <br><br>One of the most reliable ways to set up proxies/firewalls is to open them wide up to be sure that they work, then start locking them down to what you actually need and is secure.

I have no doubt that some are harder than others, as that wasn't what we were going for.
