A lot was talked about in this edition of the Absor Infobits:<ul><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045789.html"><b>Scam Alert</b></a><br>It seems that once again someone is trying to obtain EverQuest passwords through the use of a backdoor program. Please, if you receive an e-mail claiming to be an EQ2 trailer, do not open the attached file. Just delete it. Here is a copy of the text from the e-mail in question: <br><br>&#8220;cool, you play everquest? everquest is such a cool game, its so addicting =)<br>so what server is your char on and whats its name? Im on Fennin Ro and my<br>char is named tersik. Send me a tell if your on that server. Did you hear<br>that there gunna release an EQ2? I found the trailer for EQ2 on the net. If<br>you wana check it out i sent it to you. whats your race and class and what<br>lvl are you? ight well i got to go so ill talk to you later.&#8221; <br><br>So, once again, please do not open or save any EQ2 trailers, because there is no such thing as an EQ2 trailer. It is a scam in attempt to steal access to your EverQuest account. <br><br>Thanks to Catalyst from Everlore for bringing this to our attention.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045777.html"><b>More Necro Issues</b></a><br>Tamria wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;I'd like Absor to answer two things:<br>1). Are you still reading this thread? heh<br>2). Please clear up the confusion regarding why ubermobs resist lifetaps. Some thing it's purely MR related and others (myself included) think it's because ubermobs are tagged as 'untappable' (much like some mobs are tagged 'unmezable', only they give you the courtesy of telling you this when you try and cast on them...).&#8221;]</i></font> <br><br>Still reading. And I&#8217;ve stated the way I understand it, Lifetaps are resisted as magic, not on some special resist. And there is no Lifetap flag. But I&#8217;ll double check that for you.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045870.html"><b>Details on Tomorrow's Patch</b></a><br>We&#8217;ve got a lot of changes planned for the next patch. Changes for hybrids, a change to the way that movement spells work (specifically Root), and a bug fix for Lure spells (among many other things). First and foremost I want to explain the fix to Lures. <br><br>Right now (before the patch), creatures that should not get a save versus Lure spells are getting saves based on their levels. This has been broken for a while. We fixed it on test before Christmas, but this is the first patch since then, and the fix should go live with the patch. Basically, Lures will become less resisted after the patch. <br><br>The changes to hybrid disciplines and powers are as follows. Hopefully these will be the last. <br><br>1) Resistant Discipline will last five minutes instead of one minute.<br>2) Holyforge Discipline will lasts five minutes instead of two minutes.<br>3) Sanctification Discipline will last fifteen seconds instead of ten seconds<br>4) Lay on Hands will have increased healing for each level after forty of the paladin. After forty it will do approximately twenty points per level more (for levels 41-60).<br>5) Normal Harm Touches will save as all or nothing. There will be no partial resists.<br>6) Harm Touch will increase ten points per level for levels one through forty. From levels forty-one to sixty it will increase thirty points per level instead of twenty<br>7) The Harm Touch discipline will increase Harm Touch damage by fifty percent instead of twenty-five percent<br>8) Weaponshield discipline will last twenty seconds instead of fifteen<br>9) Leechcurse discipline will last twenty seconds instead of fifteen<br>10) Deftdance will have its duration increased from ten to fifteen seconds<br>11) Puretone will have duration increased from two to four minutes<br>12) Hybrids will no longer reset weapon timers after casting a spell (further explanation below)<br>13) Trueshot discipline damage calculations will be changed (further explanation below) <br><br>We will also be giving Hybrids a new spell at level fifty. <br><br>Now for the further explanation: <br><br>Trueshot damage was messed up. Basically it was giving low damage bows too much damage and high damage bows too little damage. We are making the damage more in line with the base damage of the bow. This will reduce the damage of the discipline for some and increase it for others, depending on the type of bow you were using. <br><br>As for the timer/casting thing&#8230; As it is now, casting a spell while using a weapon will cause your weapon swings to be delayed by the casting time of the spell. So, making up numbers here, lets assume you would swing your weapon every ten seconds. If you were to cast a five second casting time spell directly after a weapon swing, then your next swing would occur fifteen seconds after the last one (adding the five seconds for the spell). For hybrids, this will no longer happen. So if your weapon takes ten seconds to swing, spell casting will no longer increase that swing time. <br><br>Movement Rate Changes: <br><br>We have made some changes to the way movement enhancement/reduction works. Essentially, Root and Snare are now completely different spells. This means that Root will suppress snare, but it will not overwrite it. That's the primary change. But there is also a side effect to this change. <br><br>Bard songs will no longer break root. Root will also suppress songs that enhance movement. <br><br>We are aware that this will be seen as a 'nerf'. However, I'm pretty sure that most of you understood that bard songs were never intended to break root, and this is, in fact, essentially a bug fix.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045780.html"><b>Shaman Talk</b></a><br>How about a 'hang in there'? <br><br>Changes are not made over night. We're looking at a lot of issues. Your concerns have not been ignored.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044943.html"><b>Hate List Suggestion</b></a><br>I'm here. I'll ask about this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043278.html"><b>Defoliation - Necro Spell & Plane of Growth </b></a><br>Well, in the case of discussing what are and are not plants, there are two things to consider. The first is, could it be seen as a plant by some use of the word plant (as the discussion about fungi does), and also whether or not it&#8217;s a good idea for the game to consider such things plants. <br><br>Obviously if a treant is a plant on Norrath, it&#8217;s probably still a plant on the Plain of Growth. But we also have to consider the gameplay repercussions of allowing them to be considered plants on that plane. It&#8217;s easy enough to justify not having Defoliation work on them from a roleplaying standpoint (they are at the heart of Tunare, and are therefore more than mere plants). The question there is, would allowing that spell to work on them be too much from a gameplay standpoint? I don&#8217;t know the answer to that. I&#8217;ll ask. <br><br>As for fungus&#8230; I hear that some fungus are affected by defoliation and some are not. We&#8217;ll probably look into that.</ul>

Some people are now claiming eBay is stopping EQ auctons on their site:<blockquote>Hello, <br> <br>E-bay bidders are starting to recieve notices that their bids were cancelled, upon checking, they see a big fat EVERQUEST ACCOUNT BANNED next to their names. <br> <br>Thanks, <br> -T</blockquote>Haven't yet been able to confirm it yet so please take it with a grain of salt.<br><br><b>Update:</b> I've investigated some of these claims further, and parts of the reports I decided against posting, and determined either the original reports were inaccurate (ie, flat out lying) or eBay is removing a very small number of auctions items seemingly at random.

Alan <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291.html">summed up where things are</a> at regarding the intense Necro discussuions taking place on the Gameplay Board:<ul><i>The old threads were getting a bit nasty and were wandering. Let's not have that happen here.<br><br>Let me sum up my thoughts on this whole thing.<br><br>Necromancers are just fine, in all aspects of the game, with one possible exception.<br><br>On raids they can find a lot to do up to and after the encounter with the boss mob. But in that encounter some necromancers don't feel that they have enough to do, or feel that what they can do isn't what they want to be doing.<br><br>In this thread I would like to keep to one narrow focus. What things could be done to give necromancers more to do in that one encounter, without improving their power in other situations?<br><br>It's a very narrow question, and a very hard one to answer. Here are the ideas that I've seen that won't work, or won't happen:<br><br>DoT stacking: We're probably not going to allow more DoTs to stack than already do. And this would have an impact far beyond the scope here, it would increase the power of necromancers across the board.<br><br>Unresistable Lifetap: Probably never going to happen. I understand the whole concept of Lifetap to power mana transfer. I'm just telling you with a pretty firm tone, that it's really not likely to happen.<br><br>Mana Transfer: The rate will probably not be improved. As I've said before, currently necromancers can convert 1 hit point into 1 mana. Right now they can give that 1 mana to a cleric (as an example) for the cost of about 2.5 mana. The cleric can convert that mana into about 2 hit points. That's the right ratio, really. There shouldn't be a time when the amount that can be returned is higher than the amount that is given out.<br><br>Poofing: with the next patch, this should be pretty much fixed&#8230; let me copy one of my other posts:<br><br>"Ok, this whole thing was Alan getting confused.<br><br>There was special code put in several months ago that prevented nearly any possibility of a corpse poofing if the NPC is over 54th level. I was right there.<br><br>But recently, a few weeks ago, we added some code to deal with a unique NPC situation (that I'm not going to go into&#8230;) that might have been causing corpses to poof is the kill was assigned to a Link Dead PC over 54th level. This will be changed with the next patch.<br><br>I was confused and thought that this change was already in.<br><br>I'm sorry about the confusion.<br><br>Alan"<br><br>In any case, let's leave this one off the list until we see how things go post-patch. I have noticed, though, that the only complaint I've seen was about Ragefire&#8230; I wouldn't be worried about poofing due to DoTs anymore. At least try it out.<br><br><br>Issues that we can discuss:<br><br>Ignite Bones: I'm willing to suggest some change to remove the skeleton. I think to do that we need to have something that does the same sort of thing, but I don't know what that is. This spell will probably never be changed into a standard direct damage spell. I like some of the ideas (like changing the tinting on the target), but unfortunately most of them don't seem possible technically. I'll keep thinking up ideas. Post any you have here.<br><br>Group Feign Death: I haven't mentioned this idea to the team yet. I suppose that there might be a lot of reasons not to implement this idea&#8230;<br><br>Making pets immune to fear: This probably won't happen. Then we'd have to do the same for magicians (not an inherently bad thing, but it has broad repercussions), and there's PvP to consider. But I think I have some interesting ideas along these lines that might work out. I want to here other ideas along these lines.<br><br>Possessing the pet: that's a cute as heck idea (maybe 'cute' is the wrong word&#8230;). Another one that I'll mention to the team. But keep in mind that I'm not really looking for totally new stuff. I'm not advocating that we start making up new spells and whole new concepts. It would be hard to justify spending a ton of time making new concepts at this point. But it's certainly interesting&#8230;<br><br>Essence Emerald: I'm kind of in favor of using this device as a way of changing things. It's a very expensive casting cost&#8230; For example I kind of liked the idea of allowing the mana transfer spell to be usable on others, considering the cost.<br><br>Unrelated Issues (meaning that I'm mentioning them here so that you don't have to bring them up&#8230;) :<br><br>I'm aware that Track Corpse doesn't work. I'm going to ask about that.<br><br>The epic weapon. It's not really related to this anyhow, and I am already very aware how you all feel about it.<br><br>Defoliate: If someone wants to start a new thread about which things they think should be affected by this spell, go for it. But it's not part of the focus of this thread.<br><br>I may have missed some&#8230;<br><br>Keep in mind that I understand that many of you are not happy with a support role on raids. I'm fairly convinced that it is perfectly fine for a necromancer to act in that role during the final battle of the raid. But I'm open to ideas (barring the ones that I've already vetoed) that would make them more aggressive at that one final battle.<br><br>Alan</i></Ul>

Even at 2:1 it would be too much (plug it into my calculation). <br><br>Xdammedx wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "As for the lich thing, it totally sucks that the rest of us have to suffer because of a BUG on 3 total servers out of over 30."]</i></font><br><br>Actually, you're not 'suffering' from this bug. You're gaining from it. It reduces the damage that the spell does to the caster. You're getting a 1:1 ratio of hit points for mana, instead of a 3:2 ratio as was intended. <br><br>Scriabin said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Frankly, "interesting" is about the last thing from our uber, Vox-soloing minds.

You claimed we get a hp to mana ratio of 1 : 1. Were you mistaken on this or are you sure? Demi lich is 48 hp for 30 mana supposedly, 48 hp for 48 mana seems like a lot. Or were you referring to 48 hp * 33% = 16 48 hp - 16 hp (for pvp coding) = 32 hp.

Brad posted a follow-up to the thread he started <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924.html">yesterday on the Gameplay Board</a>:<ul><i>Hi all,<br><br>Again, thanks very much for all of the responses, feedback, and ideas. I've read through them twice now and it's given us a lot to think about. Perhaps there are some issues that could be addressed in the short term, but I also think there are some lessons to be learned whose solutions probably won't be realized until the second generation of massively multiplayer games.<br><br>The following are excerpts from various posts to this thread and my responses. I tried to vary the topics and issues as much as I could and get a decent sample of the many threads. That said, I'm not saying these are the best (or worst) responses, and I'll apologize in advance if yours isn't one I responded to.<br><br>-----------<br><br>Goji: "Downtime should be easily reduced the higher level you get. This scale is met in the mid levels quite well..." <br><br>Well, the death penalty continues to go up, but then we introduce the resurrection family of spells, which we assume will be used the majority of the time. Also, mana regeneration and other spells are introduced to compensate for the increased mana costs and total mana a character may have.<br><br>Uberwolf_Unity : "Exactly&#8230; you should be rewarded for reaching higher levels ... everything should not simply get more difficult and more time-consuming.<br><br>However downtime that is required to GET into that group is unacceptable and should be shortened if at all possible. For example, lets imagine I want to hunt in Kael in Velious. I'm a warrior, so I'll have to do some walking. Lets imagine I start at Karnor. First I walk to the druid ring (5 minutes) and wait around for a ride (variable, average 10 minutes). Since the Wakening lands ring is unsafe to a majority of druids I get a ride to Iceclad. I run to Kael (15 minutes) and then wait around looking for a group. An opening eventually happens in a group (VERY variable number here, lets assume 15 minutes) and I then begin to fight.<br><br>With the above scenario we're looking at close to 45 minutes to an hour just to get started playing the game. If a death results after working this hard just to get to point A, getting back to that point could take as long or longer. This means the majority of my evening could be consumed by downtime.<br><br>Karnor, Lower Guk, Temple of Cazic Thule&#8230; all have one thing in common. Downtime is reasonably small for these dungeons. There are bindable places close, there are druid and wizard teleports very close, there are safe 'zone lines' that one can exit from, and there is a LOT of room for groups to adventure in."<br><br>I think you've got some great points there, and there definitely is a difference between adventuring in some of the newer zones relative to the older. In an attempt to make larger zones to reduce over crowding we've also created a situation where it obviously takes longer to travel. One of our many plans in the future to improve EQ is to attempt to get zone size 'just right' - not too big, not too small. And, of course, this also relates to where the teleport points are.<br><br>Lisset: "The boat trip from BB to Kunark is no worse than the trip between BB and Freeport. I've timed it. It's approximately a 20 minute trip in both cases. However, if the boat just left (and you usually have no way of knowing if it did) it's now a 35 minute trip.<br><br>So let's say you want to travel from Firiona Vie to Freeport and can't get a port (believe it or not, it's possible). You've got a potential travel time of over an hour. And that's just from city to city. That is not traveling to your final destination. All of this is assuming that you don't get disconnected and have to start all over again."<br><br>We've really tried to get the boats running smoothly and as fast as is reasonable, but they ARE there as a means by which we make the world larger. We feel it should be time consuming to travel from one continent to another. If it was a similar trip from one zone in one continent to another as it was from one zone to another across the ocean&#8230; well, I really think that would diminish the immersive nature of a virtual world. <br><br>Airtreader: "Please, Brad, name 3 things that VI has done to mitigate unwarranted downtime. Maybe 2 things would be easier. One thing? Oh, yeah post 35 while in downtime you don't have to look at the book any more."<br><br>Since launch, we've:<br><br>1. Halved the experience lost due to death.<br>2. Increased boat speeds<br>3. Increased range for evac and teleport spells<br>4. Added a second boat between Freeport and Butcherblock<br>5. Increased treasure and experience gain rewards for many older quests<br>6. Implemented Specialization<br>7. Enhanced High Level (35+) Meditation<br>8. Reduced many spells' mana costs<br>9. Added Summon Corpse<br>10. Added Call of the Hero<br>11. Given more classes resurrection family spells<br>12. Added more resurrection family spells<br>13. Improved Tracking<br><br>I'm sure there are many others.<br><br>Post_Toasties: "Is this how one becomes a gaming god? Farm for ideas?"<br><br>You bet. Listening to feedback, learning from others, and 'farming' ideas are definitely ways to become better at just about everything in life.<br><br>Terrak_Steeltalon: "Well, I don't think that the exp penalty concept in and of itself is too bad, but it's how it is executed. Death at the high levels doesn't cost you a few hours if you don't get a res, it can cost you days or weeks worth of exp. That's really just not fun and I think that needs to be softened. Also, like others, I think it's a real downer to lose a level due to death."<br><br>I think I agree with the losing level part, and I'm going to debate it a bit with the designers (although even if we all agree, I'm not sure such a change to EQ would be practical). As for your other point, as mentioned, we do expect the majority of high level deaths to be mitigated by resurrection family spells.<br><br>Lisset: "It's my belief that downtime should not force you to do nothing. You should be able to do something useful, even if it's not as useful as what you would like to be doing.<br><br>Take waiting on for the boat. At least while you're doing that you can usually fish. However, the fishing skill pretty much sucks. If the fishing skill actually did something more useful we would see a benefit from having a good fishing skill and wouldn't mind the waiting so much.<br><br>The key here is that while there would be a benefit to fishing in that scenario, the benefit is far less than if that time had been spent hunting. Therefore you have downtime, but it's not useless."<br><br>I definitely agree with you, but honestly, it's easier said than done. I think going forward this is a very real goal: provide other activities when downtime is incurred - the player should never be doing 'nothing' (btw, though, I don't consider socializing 'nothing').<br><br>Grave_Robber: "Death of a tank could also = death for the entire group as well. Multiple penalties for all in the group. Death = a long wait for the guy to get back."<br><br>That's an excellent point, and why we feel the melee binding issue is a balance issue for all classes, and that were it changed the entire pace of the game would change also. In other words, the fact that melee classes cannot self-bind and must bind in city zones is part of the death penalty for both melee classes AND non-melee classes.<br><br>Meleagar: "I think that the whole concept of "corpse recovery" is just a flat-out bad idea, and it involves far too much work to recover from a death. It prevents people from even WANTING to explore highly dangerous areas, simply because they could lose everything they've earned up to that point, equipment-wise. The experience penalty is bad enough ... why tack on a huge corpse-retrieval penalty?"<br><br>Because 'corpse recovery' allows us to add a variable to the death penalty. It's based on the premise that death in the depths of a dungeon should incur a greater penalty than death on top of a hill outside of a city. The depths of a dungeon should be a scarier, more risky place (and therefore, have better treasure) than, say, the top of a hill outside a city, and therefore dying there should be nastier. So while experience lost is the same regardless of where you die, the time involved in recovering your corpse is not, and neither is the risk you'll not get back your equipment.<br><br>Lerahs: "I understand totally. But why does time lost (due to one death) cost a heck of a lot more than [the experience gained] winning that particular fight. I understand there has to be a penalty, but your system really seems to be designed to hold the player back."<br><br>Because we expect the majority of time the ratio of NPCs killed to you dying to an NPC to be significantly in your favor. In other words, many more NPCs die than players in most adventures, and so a single death needs to cost the experience gained by killing many NPCs.<br><br>Chief_Wahoo: "'The fundamental advancement mechanism in MMORPGs is Time Invested.' Why? Why is this the only advancement mechanism that anyone has come up with? This in and of itself is the paradigm that you have entered and now you can't think outside of the box. Change your views of what you consider the main advancement method and you can change your views of the rest of the issues."<br><br>I don't know for sure why this is the only mechanism people have come up with, but it seems to be (at least for MMOGs). I sure don't like to 'think in a box', which is one of the very reasons I created this thread (to get feedback and hopefully new ideas for the future). But the other advancement mechanisms used so far in games (pure luck, actual real life skill and dexterity ('twitch'), puzzles, etc.) don't seem to be what RPG players want and/or simply don't work in an online persistent environment. I'm all ears if you can think of a better one that would really work - heck, if you can, please email me and we'll definitely talk :)<br><br>Alcarian: "Again, I reiterate: I don't play EQ to 'learn good tactics'. Why would I do this? Where would I ever use these 'tactics' except in this game for powergaming? Will you now tell me that learning 'good tactics' and how to form the most 'efficient group' is somehow a public service provided by VI--for RL situations?<br><br>I play a game such as this to have FUN. I am willing to pay for it--up to the point I find the first game out that deals with my complaints. There isn't one, YET. But there will be. And, until VI gets it together and starts addressing my 'fun issues', then the doom of ultimate cancellation looms on the horizon (no pun).<br><br>By telling me that downtime penalties are in place to force me to 'learn tactics' and 'form efficient groups', you are, in effect, telling me: be a powergamer or suffer."<br><br>With all due respect, I totally disagree. Discovering effective tactics, playing smart, and being efficient don't make someone a 'powergamer'. That's like saying a casual gamer is somehow unable to use good tactics and operate efficiently in a group - I don't buy it.<br><br>RunDMZ: "I CHALLENGE the designers to create a level one character (a melee or hybrid preferably) and play him WITHOUT twinking and WITHOUT grouping with the other designers (meaning pick-up groups only).... find yourself soloing quite a bit? or at least wishing you could? Find yourself begging for Binds, SoW's, etc? Could you find that cleric you needed? You having fun running across 12 zones to get your body? Still waiting for that boat?"<br><br>Oh come on, many, many designers have played multiple race/class combinations to high levels, without twinking, and by making friends with players who don't work here. And yes, we ask players for binds and SoWs, and yes we often find clerics for our groups, and yes we wait for boats at times (although I prefer to make friends with people who can teleport me). Hrm, and no, I doubt we run 12 zones to get our bodies unless we have a brain fart and forget to bind where we should :)<br><br>Belrath: "Verant - you still have never directly asked me for my opinion on anything other than whether or not I want to renew my subscription. How do you know if I am happy? Do you view every active player as happy because they subscribe? You should poll your players A LOT and get demographics on who thinks what. All these blanket statements about how happy everyone is nonsense."<br><br>I don't think subscription numbers and churn rates are at all 'nonsense' indicators, rather I think they are ultimately the best way to gauge the success of a product. But I do agree there are other ways to gather information and to learn how to make a better product, including polls. I DO think we should poll more often. Perhaps Absor could start a thread on what you all think we should ask our customer base via polls. <br><br>Thessaly: "I hope you're reading this far down the thread, because I think this is the only post I've ever tried to address directly to you or anyone else "in charge", in 18 months of following this board. And I'm doing so because you actually seem interested in the responses. Please, please listen to me, as an average but longtime player who has no personal vendetta on any particular issue."<br><br>I definitely read down this far and beyond :)<br><br>I can also say with certainty that both I and all the other SOE/VI employees that post here and read these boards are interested in the responses and the feedback in general. We are listening, and we greatly appreciate the time many of you take to post.<br><br>Yzona: "Conclusion: You need to encourage risk taking instead of actively discouraging it, and one way to do this is to reduce the penalty for it, which in most cases can be summed up as downtime."<br><br>Wow, one of best counter arguments posted, giving me much to think about - thanks. As for your conclusion, though, it seems to be contradictory. 'Risk' fundamentally implies a penalty for failure. The greater the risk, the greater the penalty (and hopefully, the reward). IMHO, Reducing penalties doesn't encourage risk taking without also reducing the risk itself.<br><br><br>Skruff: "AC has very different death penalties, loss of vitae affecting stats and skills while you make up some additional exp, and the loss on your corpse of only some of your (best) items and all your money unless you recover them in time (much shorter time limits). So no major exp loss, no losing all your items, and yet the desire to stay alive is just as great and the fear of dying no less than in EQ. What this proves to me is that you don't need a massive death penalty to create a sense of atmosphere or a "risk versus reward" motivation."<br><br>Regardless of how effective or not that system is for our distinguished competition, I really don't feel it would work for EQ. First, EverQuest is more group oriented, and coming back after death with significant stat penalties would make you unattractive for a time (even after you'd looted your corpse). Also, EverQuest is a VERY item-centric game, and significantly increasing the chance of item-loss would turn out to be a much harsher penalty than what currently exists.<br><br>Aldarion_Shard: "Guilds are 99.99999 percent of the time a downtime INCREASING factor. They want you to help power level. They want you to help them go on a raid for stuff you don't need and won't be offered a roll on. They want your ports, sow's, rez's, etc. the best way to eliminate downtime is play solo and don't talk to anyone."<br><br>I think that definitely depends on the guild. Guilds for me have had the opposite effect and have definitely helped me decrease downtime. They've provided people to group with me, they've helped me recover corpses, they've teleported me, they've resurrected me, they've given me advise on where to hunt, etc. <br><br>Petoffen: "Verant has done a pretty great if imperfect job.<br><br>Heck even the players have been partly to blame - for example, Verant has given us great AE tactics for wizards, yet they are little-used.<br><br>If anything, I'd tell Verant, keep the game with lots of challenge for the single group. I prefer not having to get huge raids together much, even if that does have its place at times. And do something to keep the uberguild stuff under control. I'm on the server they say is best for this, and I'd hate to imagine the servers where guild fight over who gets to raid what more."<br><br>I think you've got a good point there. The majority of content in EQ should definitely be targeted at a solid group (4-6 players). Then should come the really difficult stuff, requiring multiple groups, as well as content for people who prefer soloing. Recently, as we've focused quite a bit on higher levels and very difficult challenges, we've also added a lot of multiple group content. And while this in and of itself is definitely not a bad thing, in the future we'll make sure more single group challenges are added, as well as content for all level ranges, more playing styles, etc.<br><br>Lerahs: "I say again THANK YOU Brad for coming in and starting this discussion. Communication means a lot to tons of us. A post like this once a week will do a lot for EQ."<br><br>Thanks Lerahs, but unfortunately I simply don't have the time to post here often. I read the boards a lot, but I'm really the type that prefers detailed design discussions which, of course, require a lot of time to read through and respond to. Hopefully Absor can conduct similar threads regularly (I know Abashi used to), and I'll try to drop by occasionally as well.<br><br>'Till next time,<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

Brad started a new thread on everyone's favorite EQ experience, server downtime.  Here's his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044791.html">post directly ripped from the Gameplay Board</a>:<ul><i>I'm bumping a couple of older threads in a sense, because I'd like more discussion and brainstorming on downtime in MMORPGs in general and EQ specifically. The following are three posts I made that might have been missed because the threads became pretty large. <br><br>The first deals with why downtime is used as a penalty for death and inefficient grouping, the second deals with travel, and the third talks about why downtime has nothing to do with us 'making more money.'.<br><br>Anyway, let's see if we jumpstart this discussion again... I'd love to see this debated here and elsewhere.<br><br>---------<br><br>The fundamental advancement mechanism in MMORPGs is Time Invested; therefore, Time Lost needs to be the fundamental death penalty if the principle of risk vs. reward is to be preserved.<br><br>The time lost can be in the form of experience loss, an experience debt (a cool idea, btw), items lost (providing it takes time to acquire items), corpse retrievals, etc. <br><br>As a corollary, being efficient in terms of time spent is the quickest way to advance (assuming advancing quickly is your goal, of course). Downtime, which is likewise often debated and criticized, is also a penalty based on the Time Invested/Time Lost principle. Minimizing or even eliminating downtime using intelligent tactics in a well-balanced group is an efficient time investment. Failing to do so incurs a Time Lost penalty, though probably not as severe as dying.<br><br>-Brad<br><br>------<br><br>Seriously, as I posted recently, downtime is most often used as a penalty (for death, inefficient grouping, etc.). A challenge within the game, therefore, is to be efficient and to minimize downtime.<br><br>This isn't as applicable to travel (well, unless you consider teleportation spells), but please realize that there is a balance we've tried to achieve between tedium and losing how big a world feels and the sense of accomplishment from travel.<br><br>This probably opens up a new area of discussion and debate, that being how does one create a virtual world in an MMOG that is large, where exploration is important, where players feel accomplished after traveling great distances, yet isn't tedious when it comes to frequent traveling....<br><br>In a recent discussion an example came up: Frodo traveling to Mount Doom was exciting and perilous the first time, but if he had to go there over and over again, it would get tedious. So, is it possible to set up a system such that the fun and accomplishment of traveling to that far away, exotic land is maintained, yet repeated travel isn't tedious?<br><br>I think we got closer to this goal with the way the dragon teleportation works in Velious...<br><br>Anyway, just some food for thought.<br><br>-Brad<br><br>-------<br><br>Would you guys stop with the 'downtime is there to keep people playing to make VI more $'... sheesh <br><br>The way we keep people playing is by making a fun and challenging game that people feel compelled to play... by focusing on character development, an immersive and interesting world, and by creating an environment where people can easily develop online relationships.<br><br>Downtime is there as a penalty (please read my other posts). It's not supposed to be fun, and the challenge is to avoid it. <br><br>If people thought there was too much downtime and that the majority of their experience playing wasn't any fun, they'd leave. It wouldn't KEEP people playing and make us money, rather it would have the OPPOSITE effect.<br><br>Some of you might find this hard to believe, but the EQ teams are a bunch of gamers who want to make a great game. We NEVER talk about money and profits and revenue at tuning meetings. We talk about what would make the game better, or what needs to be addressed to fix balance issues, etc.<br><br>In addition, there are no corporate suits breathing down our necks, pushing profits and such. That didn't happen when we were part of 989, nor did it happen as Verant, and it's not happening at SOE.<br><br>Why? Well, most good game companies know to leave their creative people alone as long as they're making great and profitable games. And guess what? EQ continues to be a huge success.<br><br>As a final note, just to really illuminate how ludicrous the 'downtime = more bucks for VI' argument is, let's talk a bit about bandwidth. It's really, really expensive. Were we purely out to make the maximum dollars possible, we'd scheme and plan to make a game where you hardly logged on at all, but still paid us ten bucks a month. That's right: the most profit comes from a subscriber who plays only occasionally. The guys who play crazy hours every day cost us more due to bandwidth used.<br><br>That's right, casual gamers, we make the most money off of you! *evil cackle* <br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

A challenge within the game, therefore, is to be efficient and to minimize downtime. <br><br>This isn't as applicable to travel (well, unless you consider teleportation spells), but please realize that there is a balance we've tried to acheive between tedium and losing how big a world feels and the sense of accomplishment from travel. <br><br>This probably opens up a new area of discussion and debate, that being how does one create a virtual world in an MMOG that is large, where exploration is important, where players feel accomplished after traveling great distances, yet isn't tedious when it comes to frequent traveling.... <br><br>In a recent discussion an example came up: Frodo traveling to Mount Doom was exciting and perilous the first time, but if he had to go there over and over again, it would get tedious. So, is it possible to set up a system such that the fun and accomplishment of traveling to that far away, exotic land is maintained, yet repeated travel isn't tedious? <br><br>I think we got closer to this goal with the way the dragon teleportation works in Velious... <br><br>Anyway, just some food for thought.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044581.html"><b>Class & Race Balance</b></a><br>Actually, that opinion appears fairly similar to our core philosophy behind class balance, that people choose classes to play because that class appeals to them and because there are compelling reasons to play that class. And that, because EQ is a game with an emphasis on grouping, most classes play an important part when it comes to group interdependence. <br><br>A literal balance of power (or how one class would stack up to another in combat, or against a particular mob) should always be secondary.</ul>

But they are still a relatively small part. Consider how many hours you spent on raids, and compare that to the hours spent playing your character up to the level you needed to go on those raids. <br><br>And even on a raid, fighting the boss mob may be the climax, but it isn't the whole raid. There is a lot more to it than that. In my opinion, a good player will be wanted on a raid because he's good, not because he's a necromancer (or because he isn't a necromancer). <br><br>But I'm not saying that your concerns should be ignored because of this. I am talking to you about this because I do think it matters. But too many people are trying to find some way to leverage this discussion to things beyond the point, which is the end of raids. All the way up to the final fight necromancers are wonderfully useful. The focus here is on that last ten or fifteen minutes&#8230; <br><br>Carmageddon said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Please try Tanarus again - NO!"]</i></font> <br><br>Now that&#8217;s a shame, 'cause Tan is a great game. <br><br>Bloodstar1 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "If I understand correctly, one thing that can be done fairly easy is texture colors.

I'm pretty sure that, even though the models can be tinted pretty easily, that can't be done on the fly. So to make that work we'd have to make a new, tinted model for every single NPC&#8230; That's just too much work for what we're after here. <br><br>But I like this idea, and I'll double check my logic with the local artistic types. <br><br>Misicius wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "I still dont understand why mana transfer cant be one to one. The only way I can see that this would double a necromancers mana pool is that because our spells are close to the most inefficient for mana, if not the worst."]</i></font> <br><br>Let me try to go over my logic with the whole mana transfer thing. Keep in mind that players will be more creative than me&#8230; <br><br>But if a necromancer could transfer mana 1:1 then he could throw his mana around at will. Using the Lichy spells, he can convert his hit points 1:1 to mana. So when low on hit points, he can give mana 1:1 to a cleric. A cleric can heal the necromancer at a ratio better than 2:1. In essence, then, the a necromancer working with a cleric could create mana from nothing&#8230; and that doesn't even consider regeneration&#8230; <br><br>I hope that's clear: 1 necromancer hit point becomes 1 necromancer mana, which becomes 1 cleric mana, which is then turned into 2 necromancer hit points, which can become 2 necromancer mana&#8230; <br><br>It's what Magic: The Gathering players call infinite mana.

It seems that setting it too high can cause trouble as much as setting it too low. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "1. on the license agreement, make the "I accept" button the default."]</i></font> <br><br>Can't do that. From what I understand (and not by any official legal information source), it needs to be set this way so that you are consciously choosing to accept the agreement. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "2. on the connect screen, you have 2 field: username and password.

If the character name is invalid, it drops you to the character select screen."]</i></font><br><br>Well, this might be possible. But it certainly takes me longer to type in my username/server/character than it does to click the appropriate buttons. I don't think this would decrease the load time. <br><br>Personally, since I've moved to San Diego I can't get connected at any speed faster than 28.8. It _seems_ to me that it takes longer to load the game. But I'm well aware that this could only be an appearance (since I'm so miffed about my cruddy connection speed). I can recommend more than 64 megs of RAM if you want to increase your in-game performance. I went from 64 to 128 (actually, 192), and things seem a lot smoother for me. But your mileage may vary&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044543.html"><b>Necro Talk</b></a><br>Zrazzt wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) The abuse of verant in making every epic battle (dragons, boss mobs, epic quest mobs, etc) 100% MR (tap immune).

But there's a whole thread about this issue (necromancers and their place in big raids), so I'll refer you to it: <br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299.html</a> <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) DoTs lasting 90 seconds on average vs. the average 20 second battle (for XP) or the average 40 second epic battle (trakanon).  re: group friendliness in a game which is more and more solo unfriendly]</i></font> <br><br>Well, perhaps you'll find longer battles in Velious. But, well, I think the duration is fine. Let's hear discussion from your peers and others on it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) Pets attacking group members (PCs) randomly (seen this happen a lot in sebilis) ]</i></font> <br><br>Never heard of it.

Trucidation is our 1100 point lifetap, with a 10 minute refresh. It currently costs an essence emerald (if you're not sure what one of these is, basically you sacrifice a 46-59 player, they permanently lose XP, and you get a 1 time use gem). Infusion is a 10 minute cast, 1000 mana infusion, which also costs an essence emerald. 1000 mana, at the high level game is less than 1/3 our mana bar.]</i></font> <br>Sounds costly. For Infusion you do mean ten minute recast, I assume. I'll see if I can get some insight into these spells. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 8) Quivering veil of xarn does not stack with regen."  ]</i></font> <br><br>A lot of things don't stack with regeneration. That has a lot to do with the exceptional power of regeneration. And for a class that can convert hitpoints into mana, it's important to keep in mind how quickly they can get back those hitpoints. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Now, I'm not expecting all of this, but they are problems which the post-50 necro community faces day in and day out. On the big raids, which 58+ necros spend most of their online time doing, should have a use other than a robe you can get off trakanon. We are a damage dealing class (look at our spell, we're not enchanters). Necros should NEVER replace wizards, but 2 necros should be able to fill in a single wizards place. (Just as 2 druids or shamans should be able to losely fill the role of a cleric). ]</i></font> <br><br>Are you sure you want that? How would you anticipate that having two necromancers replaced on every raid by one wizard going to make you happier? <br><br>Yes, when doing anything but big raids, necromancers are a damage dealing class. And on a lot of big raids they still are (people seem to focus on those specific NPCs that have fear and reduce or eliminate the usefulness of pets). But in some cases where that role isn't available, a necromancer still has things that he or she can do to aid the group. <br><br>Again, though, I notice that when all is said, your main concern is based entirely on the end of the raid against the big NPC. That's a pretty small part of the game, even though it seems to suddenly be the focus of concern on this board. That's an interesting trend, and makes me think that the non-uber NPC part of EverQuest is pretty well balanced&#8230; <br><br>But I digress. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Necros already pay for a lot of this with: <br>-Bad faction, and KoS most places."  ]</i></font> <br><br>Sure <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -Bad mana/damage ratio on taps (can't remember which level, but at 1 point, it cost MORE mana than the damage it dealth, which is fine)]</i></font> <br><br>Umm&#8230; look at the mana/damage+healing ratio then&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -No more than ONE necro is needed in any encounter as DoTs do not stack with each other, and with shaman's sharing dots with us, plus various resistances which make 1 or 2 of the dots in our line up worthless. No other class is as limited to its use in regards to other members of the class being present.]</i></font> <br><br>Assuming that your encounter is with only one NPC. And, again, you are focusing on only one part of what a necromancer can do. Frankly, I don&#8217;t imagine that DoTs are ever going to stack like that. It would be a mess. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -Getting nerfed once a month since release =) ]</i></font> <br><br>Funny&#8230; but, as a player, I've seen how stunningly powerful necromancers have always been. I think you'd be hard pressed to point out a 'nerf' that wasn't needed for game balance. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In order to balance this, you could do the following <necros, don't scream at me>: <br>-Touch of night, increase the casting time by 1, OR lower the damage by 100 and mana by 50."<br>-Cap Screaming terror to 50 mobs.<br>-Remove our high level 1100 point tap<br>-Make high level taps, 54+ partially resistable on ALL mobs (compensate accordingly with mana usage) etc.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, you've baffled me. These all seem like 'nerfs'&#8230; maybe I just haven't read far enough to understand how these changes would make things better&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The problem is we feel worthless, except as a manna robe, at the end game.]</i></font> <br><br>Ack! Ok, I have to point this out. There is no end game. If you're playing just to reach the highest level and kill the biggest monster, then I would argue that you're missing the point. Playing is fun, all the way to the 'end game'. But once you've killed the baddest monster, do you quit playing? I hope not, because it's the playing that's fun. I guess I just don't like the term 'end game' much. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And I know abashi said (to paraphrase) "you gotta pay for the fact that you are uber aviak avocet hunters somewhere" but if I had of known the necro class would have been anti-climatic after 100+ days played, in the end game, which I worked hard for, to see gods and dragons at my feet, I would have started something else.]</i></font> <br><br>Icky-bad paraphrasing. It's more like this. Necromancers are very powerful up to 50th level. They have all the power they need to solo. They are great additions to any group. The ONLY downside to playing a necromancer is that they have to be a support character when their allies go to fight against the ultimate NPCs. I honestly don't have a problem with that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Changing the necro class to a pathetic, half-baked, poorly-thought out support class in the end game, from what it was orignally designed for, is unfair to those of us who played it. Everyone picked their class because it suited their personality (Yes, I love to play with dead things, for you trolls out there), and a <poor> support class doesn't suit me. Or I'd have selected a chanter.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, I can't argue with how you feel about that. That's completely personal. I do have a problem with your description (half-baked, etc.). You sound like you think the whole class is worthless after 50th level, and that is flatly not true. Again, you're only describing the last part of an encounter on a big raid. That's hardly an indication that anything is poorly-thought out about how your class works. It is, however, and indication that you don't like being a support character in those (essentially rare) situations. I accept that. I would just prefer that you try to avoid melodrama to make your point. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So to sum up, the big thing is, Make our taps something other than magic based if you're going to abuse the MR of mobs by making every tom dick and harry of a mob 100% MR. Do that, and you'll quelch the necro storm.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, necromancers are not the only class that has a limited type of magic. Wizards were given their wide range of spell direct damage types for a reason. I'm not sure how accurately you are portraying the volume of creatures that are resistant to taps. I hate to admit it, but I've got the sense that you're exaggerating, just from reading other parts of your post. <br><br>Naggy wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 9) Defoliation(Nec52nd disease based DD)<br>This spell works againt ONLY plant.

There's an inherent problem with spells that do a lot of damage to a certain type of monster. They have a very high potential for abuse, and they are very hard to balance.

That does sound odd. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Enstill: Cast time2.5sec, Recast instant, Max uration 96sec<br>Paralyzing earth: Cast time2.5sec, Recast instant, Max duration 180sec <br>Solution: Change Immobilize from 58th to 53th and take away Enstill. ]</i></font> <br><br>It seems to me that, by your description, the solution would be to simply switch the spell levels, making Paralyzing Earth 53rd and Enstill 49th.

However, There is a problem. Why did you add same type spells at same rank(Lv60th)? What advantage dose Arch lich have?

Then add another spell at 60th.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm going to guess on this now, and I'll come back with more information later as it comes in. But I'm guessing that Arch lich was created to give you the spectre transformation. It's other powers were given to make the form useful. I can easily suggest that the spectre appearance be given to Demi Lich and that Arch Lich be removed. But I don't think that at this stage we're likely to be creating any new spells to replace it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 11) Broken spell<br>Rest the dead(24th Undead lull spell): This does not work for 2years and will it ever?]</i></font> <br><br>I dunno.

That's not an easy question to answer and many continue to speculate why EverQuest is such a huge success. Perhaps it lies in the fact that EQ (what players call EverQuest) was the first to offer a 3D graphical world that took full advantage of the hottest 3D-video cards available to gamers. Many a marketing analyst will tell you that timing is everything and the developers of EQ definitely had their timing right. EQ was able to catch and ride the wave of the 3D graphical craze for a perfect 10."<br><br><br>Everquest Phenomenon Part II<br><br>Link: <a href="http://www.ultimategn.com/articles/30_1.shtml">http://www.ultimategn.com/articles/30_1.shtml</a><br><br>Description: <br>Part II of the feature about the Everquest Phenomenon.

In looking to the future it's sometimes beneficial to look to the past. At the deep seeded core of EQ we find a foundation based on the traditional pen-and-paper role-playing game. The most widely known PnP (pen and paper) RPG is probably Dungeons and Dragons for comparison. Both of these games have a fantasy basis that could have been borrowed from J.R.R. Tolkien himself."</blockquote>Thanks!

Alan roared back on the Gameplay Board with a vengeance with several posts on a very broad range of topics:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-5.html"><b>The Death of Necros</b></a><br>Demrack wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Ok, so if this is to be our only role in large raids where is the necro mana version of the cleric complete heal?"]</i></font> <br><br>Not at all. There are other things that a necromancer can do. You all eschew the use of pets on raids, but they work just fine against any creature that doesn't use fear. And there is Dead Man Floating, summoning corpses&#8230; <br><br>I'm not going to pretend to know everything about how a necromancer works. My concern here is that some of you are calling necromancers useless in any big raid, when it's not true. You may not be able to do a ton of damage to the boss monster, but that is by no means all there is to doing a raid. If you see massive damage dealing as the only way that your necromancer is useful, then that is where we disagree. <br><br>Musicicus said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "First off clerics are used in Raids more favorably because not only can they heal, but if the raid goes bad, they can return the exp of the bad raid."]</i></font> <br><br>And a necromancer can return the corpses so that the cleric can work&#8230; No, necromancers have as much to do post and pre raid as any other class, and more than some. And I don't hear most of you concerned with that. The major concern here seems to be that at the 'big' fight you are relegated to a support role, and you don't like that (and that you're not exceedingly efficient at it). In other parts of a raid, clearing or recovering, a necromancer is as useful as any other class (yes, even clerics). I hear that druids are in a similar position. On a raid all they do is a bit of healing and other support stuff&#8230; <br><br>Oh, and you mentioned DoTs making corpses poof. <br><br>They don't. As far as we can tell, it hasn't happened in months. We haven't been able to make it happen. At least not on anything like a raid-level mob. If anyone has seen a high level NPC corpse poof from a DoT in the last three months, please let me know and tell me exactly how and where and when and what. High level mobs shouldn't poof anymore. We've coded it so that it just shouldn't happen. It will happen on rare occasions for lower level stuff, and that's probably not going to change (though we are looking at this whole thing again right now). But the high-level-raid-boss-monster-type-NPC corpses shouldn't poof at all due to a fix we made months ago. Don't let that stop you from using DoTs. <br><br>LordZemus said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "But let's face it. Yes there is a drawback to our soloing power, and you can't complain of it. First off, having a necromancer or two on a raid is a good safety net. Do you know anyone else who can fd and res? And yes, your guildmates will be willing to let you sacrifice some secondaries once they notice you're the only one left at wipeouts. Cleric or wizard used too much mana? Pump them. Enchanter getting pummeled by a mob? ST, turn your pet's taunt back on (you do leave it off for raids, don't you?) and send it, or cast anything out of the Heart Flutter line, guaranteed to make the mob want to eat you. Throw a shadowbound out to save that tank, because Bond of Death and Deflux WILL hit every mob except the last one, despite these asinine complaints. Oh, and your DoTs do hit. Try using the right ones."]</i></font> <br><br>Some folks don't agree with the idea that a class that is exceptionally powerful at all other portions of the game might have to take a power-hit in this one part of the game. And it's not such a big hit, as there are still several useful things that make a necromancer useful on a raid. Thanks for pointing some of them out. <br><br>GeistTallon wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "LordZemus: <br><br>I'm suspicious of you even being a necro. Half the stuff you said doesn't work at all, or isn't a viable option 90% of the time."]</i></font> <br><br>I'd love to read your counter arguments to those points of his that you don't agree with. <br><br>Aerik N'Krosis wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "I wish they'd make out pets immune to fear at least (like a mindless undead should be!). Maybe use the owner's resistances for the pet? Or else lower the ubermob resistances now that they can have more than 32k HPs. This way we necros could at least DoT them and make a contribution to the fight that is in keeping with the original PURPOSE of the necromancer."]</i></font><br><br>It seems pretty unlikely that things that are currently immune to spells will be made less immune. But I kinda like the idea of making powerful undead pets immune to fear&#8230; In any case, rest assured that I'm passing this thread to the team to read, so it's not like I'm final arbiter on anything you all suggest. <br><br>Mongo wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "1. Ignite/Chill Bones: There is no functional purpose for the skeleton effect. The coolness factor fades very quickly, and the effect has the potential for making an epic encounter harder. <br>Solution - remove the illusion. These spells do land on some epic encounters, but they're forbidden because of the effect. With the illusion gone, Necromancers would have the ability to cast DD spells during these encounters. With no functional purpose to the illusion, is there an actual reason to keep it?"]</i></font><br><br>This is something that I want to look into further. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "2. DOT spells: Very simply, corpses still do poof at times when using these spells. This effects not only epic encounters, but really any encounter that may have a desired drop. <br>Solution - With as hard as this has been apparently to recreate on a consistent basis, I don't know what kind of programming solution may be available. If the problem itself cannot be reliably fixed, is there anything that could be established so that (for example) any loot on that monster would remain in play on the ground? That may not be possible, but this needs to be addressed, directly or indirectly."]</i></font> <br><br>They shouldn't be poofing any more. Not on NPCs over 55th level, which would include anything considered a raid-level encounter. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "3. Mana-dumping: Necromancers make very inefficient manastone's on these raids for the simple reason that they cannot draw mana from the mob. If this is what Necromancer's are left with on epic encounters, it should at least be somewhat efficient. <br>Solution - if making Lifetaps usable is not an option, could the mana-transfer spells be looked at so they are viable in these situations? Certainly, most would prefer that taps be usable, but if Verant more or less officially sees this as the role of Necromancers on these type of raids, at least make it a viable, efficient one."]</i></font> <br><br>Changing the resistance to Lifetap is probably not an option. And making mana transfers more efficient would be a balancing nightmare&#8230; <br><br>Let me suggest to all of you that there is no reason that your role in this one part of the game can't be different than it is in all other parts of the game. For example, enchanters don't do 'crowd control' on, say Trakonon. Their role there is different than what they do in, say, Guk or wherever. I, personally, don't see a changed role in one part of the post 50 game as a bad thing, not at all. Whether that role is useful enough, now that might be something worth talking about. But a complaint based solely on the fact that your role may be different at one point of the game than it is in others isn't something that I can fully support. I'm not saying that it's not a valid complaint, I just think that it's more of a personal opinion than a threat to the value of the class. And where one personal opinion varies from another&#8230; there may be as many necromancers that like being able to support their group on big raids as a change from just beating things up. I don't know, and it's hard for me to know. It's important to keep that in mind during this discussion.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044525.html"><b>Necro Thread</b></a><br>It would be more useful to explain all that to me in response to the thread that you are responding to.

The problem occurred when three NPCs were already attacking a pet. Any additional NPCs would swing at and hit the owner of the pet, no matter how far away he was. <br><br>This was fixed, but we forgot to announce it.

But I want to clear something up about suspensions. <br><br>I have been told that they generally last 7 to 10 business days. This would usually not include weekends and holidays, so it's possible that you may have a few more days to go.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043992.html"><b>Have there been pet level changes?</b></a><br>The only change that we've made to pet levels at all recently was the change that made it so that pets summoned with the 39th level spells would automatically raise themselves to 36th level if they were lower level than that. This only affects that particular spell. It was not any sort of global summoning change, and had no effect on the summoning spell that you are talking about. <br><br>It's possible that you've just been having a run of bad luck.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043031-4.html"><b>Archery Damage Problem</b></a><br>Yes, bow damage was unintentionally capped recently. We'll be changing it back when we patch next. <br><br>The reasoning behind it this mistake is pretty complicated. Basically, there was a damage cap already in place, but it wasn't being used. When we were setting up stuff for the new discipline we activated that cap (that's how it was intended to work when first designed, I guess). <br><br>Basically, we'll be putting it back as it was soon. I'm sorry about the mistake.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043039-2.html"><b>"DOTS  Should Stack"</b></a><br>ShockaZuulu wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "This is no different than 2 wizards landing 2 ice comets. The only difference is your limitations in programming."]</i></font> <br><br>Sure there is. Damage over time spells are more efficient than direct damage spells. Spell effect stacking is the trade off for more damage at a lower mana cost. <br><br>I do agree, though, that the whole thing with corpses disappearing needs to be resolved.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035877-2.html"><b>Welcome To Negative Respect (Two Posts From Alan, One From Brad)</b></a><br>I'm going to respond only to the original post. It would take me hours to respond to the whole thing in any detail at all&#8230; :)<br><br>AuntieShaynta: <br><br>Well, I stand by my 'victims' statement. I'm not going to argue it with you, except to suggest that perhaps you didn't read it as I intended to write it. The fault there would lie with me, I understand. I could spend another ten posts discussing it, but that would be redundant. I'm sorry if you don't agree with me. But I see no reason for that to make you respect me less. That's something I'll have to think about. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Instead, what you (Verant) did was to purposefully and knowingly give an ability to other classes and purposefully and knowingly did not give enchanters this ability -- nor any form of compensation." ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, we did. And we didn't give it to the other&#8230; minor pet classes either. We gave it to the classes that we consider primary pet classes. I honestly see nothing wrong with this. And I see no logic behind the idea that one class should be 'compensated' for things done to other classes. Should we, then, reduce the power of your class any time we reduce the power of another? I think you're failing to see the larger picture. We didn't make that choice to spite anyone, be they enchanter or shaman or any other class (in a way, rogues could use your argument and want to know why they were not also compensated for something that the these other classes were given). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "1) I was told by Verant that I would be able to enchant weapons, including the ability to enchant weapons to cast spells.

Now I see several spells that appear to be the "enchant weapon" spells -- being given to other classes. I'm reserving judgement, frankly against my better judgement."]</i></font>  <br><br>I've been following this game as long as anyone, longer than most. I've seen what you saw too, though not in exactly the same way. <br><br>At first the idea of enchanting weapons was just that, an idea. It became a 'something we'd really like to do' thing before beta. During beta it became a 'we really want to do it, but it doesn't look like we can' thing. At release it was the same way, something that they wanted to do. I don't remember any promises, from Brad or anyone else. But I might have missed that. <br><br>I can't say I disagree with you about the apparent ability that another class might or might not be getting to do something that seems very similar to enchanting an item. Personally, I plan to push for that ability, if it exists, to be given to enchanters in some way. But there may be technical issues that neither you nor I are aware of. So let's both wait and see. Though I kinda fail to see how any of this make me less respectable&#8230; Remember, you were talking about Absor, not Verant&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "2) I saw the by-any-definition poorly-handled "mage pets aren't dual wielding" fiasco solved in what had to be the second poorest way possible -- requiring giving pets weapons but removing the delay-reducing benefit of doing so. A blatant nerf to the two classes that could already have a dual wielding pet by giving them weapons. One of those classes got an admittedly small compensations. The other was told "You're not a pet class" -- despite the fact we get pets at every spell level pre-50. I took this in stride, but it was noted. <br><br> 3) Now I see what should have been the solution to the mage-pet-dual-wielding fiasco being put in much later -- and once again enchanter pets are purposefully left out. Without compensation. In fact, with a mild attendent nerf (I can't attest to this myself, as I haven't even seen a SoR yet ingame) of our pets not proc'ing as much as they used to." ]</i></font><br><br>And I guess your disagreement is with the idea that enchanters are not a pet class. They are a secondary pet class. There are two primary pet classes, magicians and necromancers. All others are secondary pet classes. *shrug* I can see how you might not like that definition, but that is the definition (we not only 'get' to set those definitions, we 'must' set those definitions or the classes wouldn't be balanced at all). Enchanters are unique in their way, as you say. They get pets at all levels. But you'll note that they also have very weak pets, in comparison. That is by design. <br><br>I think the problem here is perspective. Mine is that enchanters are secondary pet classes, and therefore they shouldn't have pets that get to dual wield without a weapon. Yours is that you are a pet class and therefore your pets deserve that ability. I don't know what I can say to change your perspective. And I don't know what you can do to change mine. I only wish you could understand why we made that choice. It's really not a matter of 'compensation' for anything done in the past. It's a matter of how it should be. We can't sacrifice the balance of the game just to compensate for things we might have done in the past. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  " What's more, I know you (Verant) aren't going to correct any of the "core" problems with EQ. Everything is subject to change, it seems, except the things that most need changing." ]</i></font><br><br>What are the core problems? I'm curious about your take on that. Certainly the fact that enchanters don't make magic items isn't a core problem. It might be the core of your personal dissatisfaction with your favorite class, one that I can't deny. I wish it was in there too. But enchanters work, they work well. They are unique, they fit into the game, they&#8230; they work. Do they work as they were initially intended? Maybe, but not entirely. Do they work the way you want them to? It seems not. That's unfortunate. But enchanters are still a rockin' class, and they have some of the coolest abilities of any class in game (and I'm not talking about Clarity, I'm talking about illusions). <br><br>But, at the end of all of this, I have to ask the personal question, since this is clearly a personal issue between you and me. How have _I_ earned your disrespect?<br>--<br>Alcarion, <br><br>I'll accept that Brad said that. I have no problem believing it. But when did he say it? Before beta? Early in beta? I know that it's something he wanted for enchanters. So did I when I was reading about EverQuest as a young pup (it seems that long ago). Sometimes the things we want just don't happen. I wouldn't count it out completely, even so. I understand your frustration about not getting that, I share it. But is that really a reason to be unhappy with everything else that an enchanter can do? <br><br>And, in a way, they can enchant items through the use of jewelcrafting skill and their enchant metal spells. It's not exactly what we had all hoped for at the beginning, but it don't suck. <br><br>As for the accusation that I'm not the same person that I was when I wrote for EverQuest Express, well that's not true. I do represent Verant now. I have to keep in mind that anything I say will be copied on a dozen news sites. So, yes, I have to be more concise and accurate with what I say. And it's highly unlikely that I'll be calling Brad names any time soon on these boards (really, I've stopped doing that&#8230; and /roleplaying rocks! &#8211; hehe&#8230;). But I'm no different than I was before. And I still have the same goals that I've ever had for EverQuest as a player and a critic. <br><br>For example, I can't rant at you for making a post like that&#8230; :)<br><br>And I am giving you the facts with my own insight tossed in. I'm just not as ranty about it as I used to be. If you think that I'm spouting lies to you in my posts, then I could see how you would think that I'd changed. But that also means that you might not have had all that high of an opinion of me in the first place. And I understand that too.<br>---<br>Brad responds:<Blockquote>I do recall replying to AuntieShaynta publicly quite some time ago, stating that it was still our intent to implement Enchanters enchanting items, but that such plans were still very much in the planning stages and considered long term. <br><br>And I stand by it -- I still think we'll see that one day (and given our desire to pretty much freeze class balancing, it will probably be one of the last significant class enchancements). But hey, never say never :)  Consider traps :)<br><br>Also, if I recall correctly, item enchantment was also talked about in earlier pre-release (probably pre-beta, but I'm not certain) FAQs, but I later had it removed (along with guildhouses, lycanthropy, vampirism, etc.) It simply was one of the few features we'd planned on but didn't have time to deliver on. <br><br>It does trouble me a little that even though I try to be clear about whether something is short term, or long, or something we're only thinking about, etc. that it often turns into a 'promise' over time... but I guess that's unavoidable. It's a form of the 'telephone game' quite often, where one person hears that we said one thing, and then they tell somebody else, and the message sort of evolves from there :)<br><br>Just to let you all know, there are still a TON of things we want to add to EQ, and we feel EQ has a very long life ahead of it. For example, although it's too early to say much, I will say that we've got some VERY big plans post-Velious. <br><br>And Tera, wow... not sure what to say :(  I certainly do my best to live up to my word. Again, though, some times things I talk about as something planned evolve somehow into 'promises'... And then some things I hopefully characterized as 'long term' are still just that: long term plans that haven't happened yet. <br><br>All things considered I'm very proud of our track record and just how much of the game we talked about pre-release game into fruition. And I'm also very proud of where the live and expansion teams have taken the game post-release. IMHO, EQ is almost everything we'd planned it to be and a whole lot more.</blockquote><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041985.html"><b>Velious Pet Code</b></a><br>There are ways to avoid the problem that you describe with your pet. In fact, someone in this thread has already pointed out why it happened, and how to prevent it. The commands that you need to control your pet in that situation already exist. There isn't a bug here, that I can see.</UL>

We always tend to get a good laugh, or roll our eyes at unfortunate individuals who end up spending their lives in EverQuest and then get interviewed in some article or go on some talk show because they goofed up in real-life.  These people give the MMORPG genre a bad name and help popular culture associate the people who these games as stereotypical losers with no lives.  As the webmaster of this site I've come across and met such people who unfortunately have little self-control...<br><br>...and until this day I thought I'd seen it all as far as real-life incidents caused by the result of someone overplaying, causing some sort of disaster, and then subsequently blaming it on EQ.

The boy died. <br><br>On Tuesday, Bragg, 24, pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. <br><br>Bragg had been playing the online fantasy role-playing computer game for hours and appeared to get annoyed by his son's crying, said prosecutor Suzanne Rossomondo. </i></UL>*shakes his head and goes back to work*
