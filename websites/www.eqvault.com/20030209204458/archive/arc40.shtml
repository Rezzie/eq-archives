The Harpy's Head Tavern kicked up a new <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/features/standards.jsp">interview with Sony Online Entertainment CEO Kelly Flock</a>.  The questions asked deal with the massively multiplayer genre and other issues along that line.  Here's a clip:<UL><b>Steve Fuller: In your opinion, how do you think SOE has set the standard for the future of massively multiplayer online games (MMOLG) that all other companies would follow with the creation of EverQuest?</b><br><br>Kelly Flock: In several areas. No other game in this genre has experienced the level of updating that goes on in EQ. Everything from expansion packs to new graphics to new quests. The game stays fresh and will continue to be improved. So, any other competitor has to have a plan to ensure ongoing maintenance and development. This will be beyond many publishers and developers. EQ also pioneered the Player vs. Environment model. Before then, Player vs. Player was the rule. It turns out that PvE is a lot more fun. Another area we've spent a lot of time on is in developing and supporting the community, so EQ becomes much more than just a game, but a complete social circle of many players.</UL>

From PlanetEverQuest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Enchanters</a>.  Their spells focus on manipulation of the mind, and this mental acuteness gives them more spells than any other class. With spells like Clarity and Charm it's no wonder that Enchanters are sought after by groups all over Norrath. But regenerating mana and charming creatures isn't all that they excell at .. take the test and see how much you know about these mystic snake charmers... <br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the charming mystics of the realms.  Clarity and haste aren't the only things that enchanters can cast.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Enchanters of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>

These are the latest quotes and excerpts written by Alan on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000150.html"><b>PvP Changes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just dropping you this line to re-assure myself you guys have completely thought these changes through. Especially the de-leveling code.<br><br><br>Since this code went "world wide" (all servers) I wanted to make sure you had thought the change through completely and weren't unintentionally affecting legitimate boosts in stats/skills. I assume we are talking about limits on ATK, Defense, Offense, etc... Some stats like ATK are based on a combination other stats like Offense, weapon skill, str, etc... Now considering that some spells give rather large atk bonuses I just wanted to ask if you guys are sure that the way you are affecting the de-leveling caps won't stomp on legitimate spell/discipline (or beserk I guess) boosts of those skills that may infact put ones skill above the 2 lvl cap.<br><br><br>Adjantis]</i></font> <br><br>Abashi answered most of the questions that came up about these changes. I thought I'd answer this one, since it's just a little different. <br><br>It is only the skill that is capped in code. Items or other such things will continue to add to your skills after the cap. <br><br>We thought of that too. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000156.html"><b>Moving Characters To Other Servers</b></a><br>We regularly receive requests from customers that want their characters moved from one server to another, or from one account to another. Unfortunately, due to the EverQuest EULA, the number of requests that we receive, the desire to maintain stable server communities and economies, and other problems associated with character moves, we can not move characters across servers or accounts. <br><br>It is important for the integrity of the server that items from a server remain on that server. We also feel that it is important that characters that have built up a reputation, good or bad, have to live with the consequences of their decisions, and are not allowed to retreat from that reputation by changing servers. <br><br><b>The only exception to this rule is when we open a Movelog for moving a large number of characters to new servers. At no other time will we move a character in such a fashion. </b><br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000134.html"><b>More Flowing Thoughts...</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The fact is Verant DID make the statement about only allowing bards and enchanters to do mana regen. I remember it. It was during the big fight that occurred after you nerfed the manastone. Arguments were made about giving mana regen to wizards. Verant said they would never do that as it defined the enchanter and bard. I wish I had a copy. oh well. <br><br>Quen ]</i></font><br><br>It sure would be nice if you did have a copy. What you say that we said and what you are upset that you think we said don't match at all. <br><br>I wasn't here then, so I don't know either. But what you say that we said was that Wizards were not going to get a mana regeneration ability, not that we would never give anyone such an ability. <br><br>And, well, in the long run it doesn't really matter how you or we twist what was said in the past. All that really matters is what makes for a better game. <br><br>It would be a bad thing for us to introduce and item or a spell that would reduce the value of the Enchanter and Bardic abilities to give mana back to others. This would be a good principle for us to follow, and I'm pretty sure that we have and will continue to follow that principle. <br><br>Flowing Thought does not reduce the value of the Enchanter or Bardic abilities to give mana back to others, for the reasons I've already stated. <br><br>Sscaley wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: quote: <br><br>It only appears on items found in the Plane of Hate and are no drop. So you won't find anyone under 46th level with an item like this. <br><br>Cazic Thule resides in the Plane of Fear. There is also at least one reward from completing the quests in Temple of Veeshan that results in a buckler with Flowing Thought :). <br><br>Other than that, I applaud that you have taken steps to remedy the abysmal gap between the effect of melee and casters. But it needs some tuning, caster-haste drops from Cazic Thule and melee haste drops from a frenzied ghoul in lower guk, I'd call that a minor discrepancy in risk/reward... ]</i></font><br><br>Sorry, my error there. I get Hate and Fear confused often enough as it is, I should be more careful when I post about them. <br><br>And I would guess that a quest in the Temple of Veeshan would be hard enough to warrant this as a reward&#8230; <br><br>I don't foresee any items with a greater 'caster haste' on them than this one. There are plenty of ways for casters to regain mana faster than natural. If we fill in the gap that you describe (and I think using the word 'abysmal' is an exaggeration), we'll use other methods than caster haste. Keep in mind that mana is used for more than just damage by a caster, where as a melee only does damage with his haste items&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You may not have said anything about never adding mana regen items into the game. But Gordon sure has, on many occasions, stated that mana regen items will never be added to the game as it would be too unbalancing. Here's a quote of his from 8/7/2000: <br><br>"What is with meditation? I've noticed that it is taking forever to med with my skill stuck at 255 (or 252?). We continue to get more mana intensive spells and more mana past the level 50 mark, but I am stuck with the same med capability I will have at level 60 that I had at level 50. So is there a fix proposed for this? How about an item that casts... or has the effect of clarity? If you can do the effect of SoW for J Boots.... why not clarity for another type of item? Seems only fair since the value of SoW is not near what clarity is anymore. <br><br>The 'solution' for what you are mentioning is grouping with classes that have the ability to increase your regen rate. Bards and enchanters can do this for you, and can certainly increase it at a rate beyond what it was at level 50. <br>Putting in other ways to increase mana regeneration would unbalance the game. The methods available to increase the rate of regeneration do so to the greatest extent that we've designed for the game. <br><br>- Gordon "<br><br>Gotta love those news archives at Caster's Realm!! He followed up on it on 8/8/2000 restating the same thing. So, to conclude, yes Verant has stated on numerous occasions that there would NEVER be any mana regeneration items added to the game as it would be too unbalancing, and yes Verant has gone back on their word by adding this item with Flowing Thought, no matter how minimal the effect is on mana regen. Just thought you should know. <br><br>Miladian 'the rat saver' Dratsaver<br>Xev ]</i></font><br><br>Ah, an actual quote. Thanks. <br><br>Let me update that statement then. <br><br>We certainly don't anticipate adding any effects that would increase mana regeneration greater than that of Flowing Thought, though it most certainly might happen. <br><br>And even should it happen, it won't be done in any way that reduces the value of the classes that can currently increase mana regeneration. And it will not be done as a method of increasing damage output for casters (other methods will be found, increasing mana regeneration does not target any specific weakness of a caster class, it improves all casting abilities of that class). <br><br>So, I guess I accept that we did once say that we would never do what we did. But I'm so overwhelmed by the volume of concern over this one extremely weak effect that I'm shocked anyone would be upset over it. <br><br>And, you know what, if we need to do something to make the game better, it won't matter that we said we wouldn't do it in the past, we'll do it anyway. <br><br>Look at these rather recent changes and tell me that you think we shouldn't have made them because we might have said that we never would: <br><br>Removal of Hybrid experience penalties.<br>Divine Aura line of spells prevents stunning.<br>More Bind points. <br><br>And I'm sure that there are many others, those are just the three that were at the top of my head at the moment. <br><br>I see no point in continuing to argue about this. The effect of Flowing Thought has no negative impact on any class, as it stacks with EVERY mana regenerating spell, and is a positive thing for all casters. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Oh no! <br><br>You said that the bard has a class defining ability to "play the mana song"! ... Ohh, you'll get flamed for this, i'm sure. :)<br><br>/hug Absor <br><br>Delphi Aegis, Paladin of Thudner<br>47th Storm of Karana<br>Quellious Server ]</i></font><br><br>Shouldn't you be playing a mana song instead of pestering me? <br><br>:)<br><br>/em runs from all the bards in the world<br>/em realizes that they are all faster than he is<br>/sit<br>/camp desktop<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000082.html"><b>Plane of Mischief</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Is it possible to make these items one time trade-able only in the POM? Meaning you make the item and trade it to a member of the raid party. If you zone out of POM before trading the item, you are stuck with it. It would be similar to the keys in POA that disappear when you zone out with the keys on your body. Only you don't lose the item. <br><br>This would solve the problem of making an item you can't use. <br><br>Barfli<br>The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br><br>Sure, it's possible to do that. <br><br>But we've come up with another solution. I'm not going to outline it, because, well, it's complicated and you'll have to figure it out on your own. But, basically, there is a way to use the no-drop items to get other items that will get you other stuff that you can keep, or use to get other stuff they suits your class better&#8230; <br><br>Or something like that. <br><br>Basically, the items will be no-drop, but you'll be able to get something that you can use if you do more convoluted things within the zone.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000108.html"><b>Alan: Ruler of Time & Space</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Since you're now the ruler of all time and space, please make Mondays go away and just add a second Saturday ;p <br><br>Kiriani<br>Saryrn]</i></font> <br><br>I would do that, but I've given myself all Sundays.

I probably should have changed this one, though. It is a bit misleading.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing For Experience, Part 2</b></a><br>Paynnne wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: paraphrased quote since it's too late to cut and paste :)<br><br>I don't know if we'll ever have a quest that would yield a bub of exp in level 40. <br><br>Why not? If it takes a few hours of camping in LGuk to get a yellow bub, why couldn't there be a once in a lifetime quest that would take a few hours and yielded a yellow bub? Until then questing will always be for items or faction. As it stands no one does questing for exp except for the low level ones like deathfist belts. The emphasis will still be on hack and slash (read - camping in this game) for exp. Why can't questing be as fruitful as camping? ]</i></font><br><br>Well, how do you know that a quest is going to be as much 'effort' as camping LGuk for a few hours? Obviously the easy way is to make it so that the quest requires that you camp in LGuk for a few hours&#8230; <br><br>The trick is to find a way to judge the value of a task by a measure other than time spent or difficulty of NPC killed. In some cases we've been able to use trade skills as a measuring stick, and I like that.

The latest message is now live on the Patch Server:<UL><b>May 8th, 3:00 am</b><br>------------------------------<br><br><br>** PvP changes **<br><br>We have made the first of our upcoming changes to the PvP aspects of EverQuest:<br> <br>- Consider:  /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character.  The <br>character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him.  The character<br> will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack.  And the character will show as<br> 'red' if he is above your range.  This will only take effect on PvP servers.<br><br>- Sanctuary Levels:  Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they<br> take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.  This will, obviously, only take place on PvP servers.<br><br>- De-Leveling:  Characters that lose levels will only retain the combat skills of a character two <br>levels higher.  This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character <br>will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character.  This change will apply to <br>all servers (it has to, code-wise).  So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people <br>that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), <br>while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find <br>themselves at no great advantage.<br><br>These are the first of the things that we plan to.  We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach <br>to changes whenever we can, and we have other changes planned for upcoming patches.<br><br><br><br>** Quest Changes **<br><br>-  We've made a change to the Velious armor quests.  The folks in Kael and in Skyshrine that give <br>out rewards for these quests are now being stricter about who they will reward quest items to.  You <br>will have to be considered an 'ally' (see Features section below) by these NPCs in order to be able <br>to complete these quests.  If you are doing quests for the Coldain, however, they are somewhat less <br>picky, and they only require that they consider you 'kindly' to reward you for your labors.<br><br>- The Black Silk Cape will now drop more frequently.<br><br><br>** Bug Fixes **<br><br>- Attacking with a two-handed piercing weapon will now 'gray-out' the attack button as it should.<br><br>- Text that once read: "You cannot remove this affect." now reads "You cannot remove this effect."  <br>Changed by popular demand... :)<br><br>- Food Emotes:  Forcing your character to eat by right clicking food will now properly display the <br>appropriate emote to those in the area.<br><br>- Fixed a problem that often made it difficult to loot really large NPCs.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- The Shield of Tsunami can now be equipped in the secondary slot.<br><br>- Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows, the better the quiver the faster your bow.  We will not <br>be listing the speed increase a quiver will give your bow, but you can tell the good quivers by their <br>ability to reduce the weight of your arrows (better-made or magical quivers have this property).<br><br>- The Ivory Handled Falchion should now 'proc' without telling you that it is out of charges.  You <br>may need to contact your GM to replace the item with a new version if it is still acting strangely.<br> <br>- The Opal Bracelet is now a wrist item, not a finger item.  Be aware, once you remove it from your <br>finger, it will not go back onto that finger, it will only fit on your wrists, as it should.<br><br>- The Large Dragonbone Shard will no longer appear to be a Staff of the Gathering.<br><br>- The Ring of Levitation will now poof when all the charges are used up, and should display the <br>correct number of charges.<br><br>- The Priceless Velium Reinforced Bow now has a range of 200 instead of a range of 0.<br><br>- The Refined Mithril Blade should now be equipable in both primary and secondary slots.<br><br>- The Unicorn Horn should now have a graphic.<br><br>- The Hammer of Flattening has been changed from tiny to large.  This might cause you a little <br>reorganization in your inventory.<br><br>- Runebranded Stone Buckler is now labeled as a shield and can be used to bash.<br><br>- The Ring of Pureblood is now a finger item, not a waist item.<br><br><br>** Spell Changes and Additions **<br><br>- Translocation spells:  Five new Wizard 'push' spells have been added (Translocate: Fay, Tox, <br>North, Combine and Group).  Translocate spells send the group to the location, while the Wizard <br>remains behind.  Translocate Group sends everyone in the group (except the Wizard) to their own <br>bind points.  Translocate Group can be found on NPCs in Velious (and they won't give them up easily).  The others are available on an exclusive vendor.  All Translocate spells (even the original Translocate) have confirmation boxes that must be accepted before the target will be sent.  And Wizards can no longer Translocate themselves.<br><br>- Some lower 39th and 44th level Velious spells have had their drop rates increased.<br><br>- GM Resurrection has had it's name changed from ResurrectionGM to Customer Service Resurrection so <br>that players will be able to better tell when they are getting a resurrection from the GM staff. GM <br>resurrection will no longer have Res effects, and will leave the newly Ressed with full Hit Points <br>and Mana.<br><br>- Divine Aura and spells of that type (Divine Aura - cleric, Divine Barrier - cleric, Kazumi's Note <br>of Preservation - bard, Harmshield - necromancer, Quivering Veil of Xarn - necromancer) will now <br>prevent the caster from being stunned when hit for their duration.<br><br>- The Eye of Zomm series of spells will no longer work in Kedge Keep.  This change was made to <br>prevent an exploit.<br><br> <br>** Feature Additions and Changes **<br><br>- Looting text has been changed.  You will now see a -- before and after any loot messages.  This <br>has been changed primarily to help prevent any fake looting messages from being thought of as real.<br><br>- When you loot an item, you will receive a text message telling you what you have just looted.<br><br>- Expanded Friends List:  The Friends List will now hold 30 character names.  And each character has <br>its own friends list.  You can find and edit this list with a text editor, if you need to, outside <br>the game.  You can locate the text files in your EverQuest directory.  The files will look like <br>this:  <character name>_<#>.ini.  The default Friends List for existing and new characters will be <br>your old Friends List.<br><br>- The destroy or drop item confirmation box will now close if you accidentally pick up another item <br>while they are open.  This should prevent accidentally deleting or dropping the wrong item.<br><br>- When selling to a merchant, you can no longer sell items that are inside a container by having the <br>container selected and clicking the sell button.  The merchant will tell you that you need to empty <br>the container before the merchant will buy it.  This should prevent folks from accidentally selling <br>items that they did not know were in those containers.<br><br>- You can now move items around inside containers that are in the bank.<br><br>- There is a new /consider message: "regards you as an ally".  This is the highest level of <br>friendliness that an NPC will register using the /consider command.  The faction required to reach <br>this rating is significantly higher than 'warmly'.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Fresh from the Developer's Corner, here is today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000142.html"><b>Guide Application</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The guide application doesn't actually have you send your password in plain text... it has you log in. However, this could be made clearer on the application, to avoid confusion. <br><br>- Xelene Solyric ]</i></font><br><br>Right. The form is secure, and the information for your login name and password are checked by the same method we use to check your login to the game. <br><br>It's good that people are worried about the security on our site, and the seeming contradiction about the password thing. <br><br>You know the site is valid because you got the URL from our main site. We ask for a validation of your EverQuest account to ensure that you actually play the game. I'll mention to the people in charge that they might make that clear on the site, thanks. <br><br>And several people have filled out the application only to lose all that information when their browser crashes. That's not fun. Whenever typing something long and complicated to be placed into an e-mail or a browser, I always type it up in a word processor first. This means I won't lose it if something happens to the browser, and I can spell check it before I let others see it. <br><br>Just a suggestion.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000153.html"><b>Stormfeather</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Players have timed this guy to a 19 hour spawn who sometimes skips. This, combined with Lodizal (an even rarer spawn) make it almost impossible to complete the Iceland map quest without days of mindless, boring waiting. I've heard reports of players sitting for 80 plus hours waiting for this guy. The quest already has one bottleneck with Lodizal as players must be lucky enough to be in on the kill, and also win the roll. The Stormfeather thing is excessive. Why should we have to sit around for countless hours to complete a quest? Could you maybe look into upping the spawn time, or perhaps at least change it from skipping spawns? <br><br>Slaede <br>52 Rogue<br>Vallon Zek ]</i></font><br><br>Here's more information from the team: <br>------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>While I didn't personally design the quest I have assisted players in it's completion with my play character. One friend doggedly camped the spawn location for over two days straight before obtaining the component it carries. Another friend put a bounty out for players who were hunting the normal spawns in the area, he paid a generous sum to the first person to tip him off when the creature appeared. I guess it's up to you how you want to play the game and how important each particular item is to your character. <br><br>It's a random spawn, not timed, and as you pointed out it can be very rare. The quest yields arguably the best facepiece in the game so I don't predict a reduction in the difficulty of obtaining it. <br><br>As a team I know we're committed to pushing the envelope in regards to what we can pull off contentwise. I feel we've made some significant enhancements lately that will enable us to provide even more compelling content in the near future. <br><br>- Steve Burke <br>-------------------------<br>Thanks for the response, Steve.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing For Experience</b></a><br>Relbeek wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm one of those strange players who gets more joy out of doing quests than out of camping. <br><br>In fact, on a lark, I did as little camping as possible during level 39 to see how well I would do getting most of my XP questing. It took me three weeks to get to level 40, 75% of my XP came from quests, and I got five pieces of Ro armor (I play a druid, so I gave the armor to a paladin friend) to boot.<br> <br>Certainly it can't be argued that if XP is what you're after that you should quest if you're any higher than your teens. And even the XP bearing quests for low levels tend to involve lots of camping for things like runnyeye beads, deathfist slashed belts, crushbone belts, and the ubiquitous bone chips. <br><br>What I'd like to see are quests yielding significant XP for higher level people - even people in their 40s and 50s. Quests that don't necessarily yield you a useful item but which will yield you enough experience to make questing a viable alternative to, say, camping the Lord Room in Lower Guk. <br><br>Now I realize the exploitable nature of quests that yield larger amounts of experience, so let me pose to you a few "catches" to help: <br><br>- Make the quest involve the retrieval of several NO DROP items, that are combined in a container to yield another NO DROP item, which is turned into the questgiver for your reward. This prevents multiquesting. <br><br>- Make eligibility for doing any given quest be based on the level of the questing PC. A quest that would yield half a bubble of experience to a level 46 character could simply be made not available to anyone under, say, 40th level. <br><br>- If you don't set eligibility requirements, make the reward based on the questing PC's level, with a 'hard ceiling'. IE it would yield a bubble of experience to a 41st level char, and would yield a bubble of experience to a 20th level character, but would yield the same number of experience points to anyone 41st level and up (meaning a 45th level character would only get a third of a bubble or so.) <br><br>With options like these in place, you could satiate the desires of those of us who truly enjoy 'questing' more than we do sitting in a group in a camp. What do you think? ]</i></font><br><br>An inspiring comment from Steve Burke, one of our designers. <br>------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Hi Relbeek, <br><br>After reading your email I think you're either a bit psychic or you've had our meeting room bugged. <br><br>Seriously, we've had a few discussions lately that have resulted in some changes being made. These changes will enable us to implement some of the suggestions you've made here, as well as some not mentioned such as quests that players can only do once in their lifetime. <br><br>We're all working on creating more original, compelling content with enticing rewards. <br><br>- Steve Burke <br>-------------------------<br>As is my duty, I have to interject a little voice of caution into this. I wouldn't expect to see a bunch of new quests pop up tomorrow with all of these features. Nobody knows better than Steve that quests take a lot of time to design (good ones, anyway). But we're all for original content and awesome quests, and we're working to improve our ability to design and implement better and more interesting quests. <br><br>I don't know that there would ever be a quest that would yield a full bubble of experience for a character in their 40s, though. But we the general concepts you propose are certainly things that we've been thinking about lately.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000151.html"><b>Theft of Thought</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I figured i jump in with a spell question (hope Mr. Poe isnt to busy atm =) <br><br>Im using ToT on mobs one common thing seems to happen, the higher level the mob the less you receive back into your mana pool. <br><br>I can understand this from a resist point of view or whatever (personally i would rather it be a stable amount like harvest), but my question is this; <br><br>Does the gain back into ones mana bar refloect how much was taken from the mob? Or do you always take a set amount from the mob, its just how much you receive that is level dependant? <br><br>Thanks <br><br>And go Lakers!!! <br><br>A_Laker_Fan_01 <br><br>=) ]</i></font><br><br>-----------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Theft of Thought takes a set amount of Mana from your target and returns it to you. This amount scales up as you level. The numbers will be the same for both sides, meaning if you take 100 mana from the target you will get 100 mana. The mana stolen, and the mana returned are both level dependant. <br><br>W00p Go Lakers ^_^<br> <br>- Lawrence Poe <br>---------------------<br>I feel like I missed the secret Laker-friends hand signal&#8230; <br><br>:)</UL>

The first part of this report was brought to us by Raneff:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night on the Bristlebane server, Fironia Vie returned to her home of <br>Felwithe in the escort of Galeth Veredeth. With the help of some old friends <br>she says she was able to escape the hold of Venril Sathir's minions.<br><br>Many adventurers gathered around to see this joyous event and we were all <br>granted an audience with King Tearis Thex. After a joyful reunion however, <br>the King turned on Galeth. His disapproval and his daughter's dissapearence <br>evident on his face. He stripped Galeth of his knighthood and instructed him <br>to serve as Fironia's guardian, perhaps earning more trust in the eyes of <br>the King.<br><br>Fironia spoke of dire things to come, and departed soon after, escorted by a <br>band of adventurers to seek out Equestrielle the Unicorn. There the blessed <br>creature of Tunare told us that in order to combat the oncoming darkness we <br>would need the Avatar of Tunare, and that to summon her we must gather some <br>sort of stones. With much haste we returned to Felwithe.<br><br>King Thex said he knew of these stones and sent several of his personal <br>subjects to retrieve them. He then rewarded those that were loyal in their <br>duties to Fironia and had escorted and protected her well during this day.<br><br>Lachinie, Neith, and Talic Moore were all admitted into the Realm of Heroes <br>and rewarded each with an item of great power.</BLOCKQUOTE>And this was sent to me from the guys behind the EverQuests comic:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night there was a great GM event on Bristlebane with Firiona Vie, her Knight, and the King.  It was wonderful, and <br>Lachine, the character in Everquests, was there, too. <br><br>Lachine is based on our 13 year old neighbor, Kimmi, and Kimmi was on last <br>night when I spotted FV and Knight pop into the game.  She came running at my <br>tell, and soon became the "herald" to the couple.  Her humor and natural joy <br>won the players behind the three characters over, and she was awarded one of <br>the special coins. <br><br>A lot of people on Bristlebane know Lachine is also the comic book character <br>and she has a great following.  Needless to say, there was massive cheering <br>when she received the coin. =D <br><br>Barry, Colin and Kimmi </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for letting us know! :)

Alan fired off a post of what he calls the "first wave" of the PvP changes.  Here's all the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000150.html">post from the Developer Corner</a>:<UL>When we patch next, the following changes will be implemented on the PvP servers:<br><br>Consider: /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character. The character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him. The character will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack. And the character will show as 'red' if he is above your range.<br><br>Sanctuary Levels: Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.<br><br>De-Leveling: Characters that lose levels will only retain the skills of a character two levels higher. This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character. This change will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise). So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find themselves at no great advantage.<br><br>There may very well be other changes in the patch, so read the patch message carefully. And this is only the first of the things that we plan to change, so don't worry that this is all that we plan to do. We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach to changes whenever we can.<br><br>Alan</UL>

This is the Friday edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000148.html"><b>Rare Shaman Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: There are three Shaman Spells that are VERY rare, or may not even exist. Please confirm that they too will have their drops increased. <br>Rain of Sickness - level 50 Never seen shaman with it <br><br>Tumultious Strength - Level 39 Never seen shaman with it <br><br>Growth - Not sure of level Does not exist? <br><br>Toxs ]</i></font><br><br>I often think that my comments on these sorts of things are extraneous. But I figure it's my job to type something here, so I do. :)<br><br>--------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Rain of Sickness does not exist in our spell database. Perhaps you are referring to a different spell? <br>Tumultuous Strength is in the group of spells that have had their drop rates increased on test. This change should go live next patch. <br>Grow currently doesn't work and is not in game. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------<br><br>There ya have it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000140.html"><b>More Cleric Spell Discussion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You said you were adressing the drop rates of the 39 and 44th level spells. Does this mean you will also remove the vendor-purchasable ones from the loot table? This would actually help the frequency of the drops. For example, Circle of Wakening Lands (44 druid) is still dropping from the wurms in the Great Divide. Since I have to go to Wakening anyways in order use it, I can just *buy* it when I get there. <br><br>Please address this issue! <br><br>-Puppypaws Fleetfoot, Veeshan ]</i></font><br><br>You can only purchase that spell (and the portal spells) from Vendors in Wakening Lands and Skyshrine. This is a bit limiting to those that can't access those vendors. Those spells will probably continue to drop as they do now.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000149.html"><b>New Enchanter Spells?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First off,<br>This is NOT a rant or anything like that. <br><br>Just a simple question. <br><br>Is there any more spells expected pre-SoL for enchanters? <br><br>Looking at the higher level spell choices our selection seems to dwindle considerably compared to other INT and WIS classes. <br><br>Wizards 59th + 60th Combined = 11 spells <br><br>Enchanters 59th + 60th Combined = 7 spells <br><br>/shrug Just hope to see alittle creativity come out of next major patch to hit test. Please consider. ]</i></font><br><br>We currently have no plans to add new Enchanter spells. But you never know what will happen. <br><br>As for the number you've quoted&#8230; well, you'll also note that Enchanters have, by far, the largest selection of spells. I have no problem with them having the smallest selection at any given level (or two). The number of spells a class has isn't necessarily an indication of the usefulness or desirability of those spells, and most certainly isn't a gauge of the value of a class (or the creativity of Verant).<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000146.html"><b>Wizard Teleport Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Why is it that we can't teleport to our spires in Great Divide? <br><br>+1 Why is it that our evacs arn't as reliable as that of druid evacs? Or is it just gossip that our evacs fail when they are needed and leave people behind? <br><br>P/S your new planned add-on really is a "work of art".. well done guys! ]</i></font><br><br>More information from the Oracle of Spells&#8230; <br><br>--------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Self only teleports to the Velious gate areas should go in sometime soon. <br><br>Both Druid and Wizard evacs have the same percentage chance of leaving someone behind. Though this chance is very small and it rarely happens. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------<br>And, thanks for the compliment on the new expansion. But, well, you ain't seen it yet. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000147.html"><b>Enchanter Mana Spell Series</b></a><br>Suudar wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan,<br><br>Since you seem to be on roll with spell questions, I would like to propose another question. What is with the Enchanter "mana" series line of spells? Thicken, Crystallize, Clarify, etc. Mana. <br><br>I know one is used in Wu's Fighting Gauntlets. But what about the rest? It seems quite intriguing to find out what you get after learning to make poison vials and get peridots. Then you get a vial of mana, that doesn't do much... Or so it seems. Can you shed a little light, not too much though as it seems to destroy the vials, on this line of spells? <br><br>Thank you! ]</i></font><br><br>I couldn't shed light if I was plugged right into a nuclear power plant. But Lawrence can&#8230; <br><br>----------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Actually these spells are already used quite extensively in tailoring. I brought the subject up with Dan and he tells me there are some other recipes that should be going into the next patch that will also make use of these spells. <br>- Lawrence Poe <br>----------------------------<br><br>Like mana from heaven, or at least mana from small vials.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000134.html"><b>Flowing Thoughts</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First, Guys be honest, you created item with mana regen on it and therefore broke the promise the you wouldn't do this. It does not matter that it's not as good as clarity 2 (neither is clarity 1) and is dropped by one of the most powerful mobs in the game. Just admit you did it and go on. <br><br>Second, Does this cheapen the enchanter class? As I understand the item, it is basically like the haste items the melee types covet. So as long as Flowing Thought stacks with clarity (which I understand it does), it should make the enchanter even more desirable for the fastest mana regen possible. <br><br>Third, Perhaps you should stop making promises as you tend to have to break them... <br><br>Just my 2cp<br>Nalenye dell'Arte<br>Level 52 Enchanter of the Tribunal ]</i></font><br><br>I am being honest. We DID add an item that give mana regeneration. <br><br>But we did not promise never to do so. That's the part where there is some misunderstanding. <br><br>Flowing Thought IN NO WAY reduces the desire for, or the usefulness of, enchanters and their ability to cast Clarity spells. The implication that it does (even if every character on every server had an item that gave Flowing Thought) is wrong. I find it offensive that people are unwilling to actually examine the effects of this item before calling us liars and thieves and other less than polite names. <br><br>Flowing Thought stacks with all enchanter and bard mana regeneration spells and songs. It won't stack with other items that regenerate mana. <br><br>It provides far, far less mana than Clarity. <br><br>It only appears on items found in the Plane of Hate and are no drop. So you won't find anyone under 46th level with an item like this. <br><br>But, oddly, those of you that decided to be offended by this item made no effort to discover the truth of the matter first. This might be because Flowing Thought is hard to get a hold of. Being offended at the addition of an extremely rare item that, indeed, has no impact on you or your chosen class is pretty silly, now isn't it. <br><br>I'm sorry for the rant. But being painted the villain, having our product and our reputations attacked without cause, is not something that I'll accept. <br><br>happ7 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: um i hate to tell ya but bards were the first to have the mana regen ability. honestly you should not consider clarity a chanter defining spell id say you are much more a illusion spell specialist if you are an enchanter ]</i></font><br><br>The timeline for the arrival of the abilities of a class are completely irrelevant to any determination as to whether those abilities are 'class defining' or not. The fact that bards did, indeed, get the first ability to regenerate mana for others has nothing at all to do with whether or not that ability defines the enchanter class. <br><br>It IS a defining ability of the class, as it is for bards.</UL>

Rithnok Tatsukao announces a new event for the citizens of the Test server:<BLOCKQUOTE>  The sun set slowly upon the precieved horizon of the Eastern <br>Commonlands as a single being walks slowly through the tunnels leading to <br>the realms of the Northern Ro Desert... He smiled softly to himself as he <br>basked in the dying light of the day. The comming of the night Heralded the <br>arrival of a world weary traveller. With him he brought only his skills as <br>an adventurer his back pack filled with his trinkets found on his travels. <br>Armed with his knowledge and his sword he slowly put down his leather <br>backpack upon the ground and propped himself up against one of the walls of <br>the tunnel. Slowly he rumaged through his pack as he sat upon his tail base <br>withdrawing a set of parchments covered with the strange writting of his <br>homelands. Although many would immediately assume he was a creature of the <br>darkness only because instead of flesh he sported claws, horns, teeth, and <br>scales. This was untrue, for those who knew him knew his knowledge was not <br>of this world. But of one yet to have been visited. This was a strange <br>Iksar, his mind was not set upon battle and glory. It was set upon a strange <br>quest that led him to this land he finds himself, perhaps one might ask <br>about his adventures. Perhaps he might tell of them... Who knows?<br><br>Event Name: Story Time In Norrath<br><br>Time: 8pm EST Monday May 7th<br><br>Place: Tunnel To North Ro In The Eastern Commonlands.<br><br>Synopsis: For the first time an event will be held on Test Server. There <br>will be a full open story time on the test server. The purpose of which will <br>be to tell stories of lands, creatures, and adventures, that might not be <br>Norrathian in the beginning but they all pertain to the lands and peoples of <br>the lands of Norrath. This will be the intoduction of story time in Norrath, <br>And the second installment of a continuing event on the second and Forth <br>Mondays in each month. The storyteller will be present for all to hear... <br>Perhaps you might find insight into your quests or perhaps you might find <br>inspiration to tell your own stories of adventure in the lands. So those who <br>always wanted to be bards but never got the chance? Come and listen, if you <br>have a story that is about the lands of Norrath Please feel free to come and <br>tell the storyteller perhaps he will find time to let you speak your tales <br>to those who gather. Come One! Come all! All are welcome here of all ages <br>and of all races, All are invited, From the players, to Guides, And even the <br>ever so Elusive GM's We hold no bar to anyone.

Fresh from the Developer's Corner, here is today's edition of the Abosr Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000135.html"><b>Mana Costs for Hybrids</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Concerning hybrids not being as efficient at using mana, and the spells of parents. The argument was put forth that no one would play the parent if the hybrids could perform as well as the parent class. The problem is that you penalize the hybrids MULTIPLE times. Not only do hybrids get penalized in mana efficiency, they also get penalized in terms of spells available. I guarantee you, no one that wants to play a cleric will play a paladin instead because the mana efficiency changes. Its about the spells that are available. Allowing hybrids to have the same mana pool was a great thing. You should take away the efficiency penalty as well, since the real difference is the spell lists. (I think that hybrids are over-penalized there as well, but I wanted to focus on the efficiency issue.) Just my opinion. <br><br>Larsk Thunderfoot of Prexus ]</i></font><br><br>Well, we disagree. There were three differences between hybrids and their caster parent classes; Mana pool, casting cost, and spell selection. <br><br>Recently we removed the mana pool difference and significantly reduced the casting cost difference. We also gave the hybrid the advantage of unique spells and a significantly reduced penalty for casting while fighting (weapon delays continue to count off while spells are being cast &#8211; only for hybirds). In combination, all of those changes make for a very nice balance of spell casting power and melee power for the hybrids. <br><br>Yes, we'd have to remove the spell availability restriction before there would be any chance that people would prefer the hybrid over the parent caster class. But just that restriction alone isn't quite enough to make the balance that we want. We're very happy with the current balance, and I don't see any need to change it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said "If hybrids could cast spells as well as their parent class, then nobody would really want to play that parent class." <br><br>You can't be serious! If my snare cost as much as a druid snare, you're saying no one would really want to play a druid?! Do you really think that? <br><br>Scout Swiftshot<br>Ayonae Ro ]</i></font><br><br>There's no reason to try to make what I wrote sound like some sort of conspiracy or trickery. I wrote that if hybrids could cast as well as their parent class, then nobody would play the parent class. That's certainly true. <br><br>If your ranger had the same spell line up as a druid with no penalties (cast as well as their parent class), then there would be very few druids. <br><br>Yes, I really think that. You do to. I'm not trying to be tricky or cover up the fact that there are indeed two restrictions on hybrids for their spells (see post above). There's no need to read things into my comments. And if I wasn't clear (though I thought I was) then I apologize for the confusion.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000007.html"><b>Necro Epic Quest Update</b></a><br>Just an update. <br><br>You'll see this in the patch message, but I figured you'd want to know now. <br><br>We've increased the drop rate on the cape rather dramatically.

I think it's a great idea, and would love to be able to cast these myself. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Aeslyn Stormwolf<br>Druid of the 29th session<br>Terris-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>The short answer is, probably not. <br><br>Regardless of past perceptions or texts or class descriptions, Wizards are becoming masters of teleportation. They will probably never get foot speed enhancement spells, that sort of travel will always be the real of the Druid, Bard and Shaman. <br><br>The reasoning behind this is pretty simple, really. <br><br>Druids have few weaknesses as a class. In fact, with the recent addition to their high level healing abilities, Druids are a very well-rounded and balanced class (though this is not the result of any final balance decision about the class, and things might be changed). Their ability to transport people is pretty darn good as it is. Not only can a Druid pop you across the ocean, he can speed up your running and get you to the final destination pretty quickly. <br><br>Wizards right now have two specialties, damage and teleportation. They should be the masters of arcane magic and ripping holes in the fabric of space. Making them the masters of teleportation not only makes a lot of sense, it also adds a dimension to the class. <br><br>Yes, we are moving toward making Wizards the master of arcane transportation. This seems like the right direction to take the class.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000112.html"><b>Forging and Eating Food</b></a><br>I submitted this before, but I wasn't absolutely sure at the time, and I have not seen a response.

(Personnel transporters work on a quantum resolution.) This prevents, say, replicating living things...or extremely complex materials such as latinum. <br><br>As for the transporters, there is a biofilter which eliminates dangerous microorganisms. I don't know why the transporters don't repair wounds...if I had to guess, though, I'd say it's because the matter-to-energy conversion is far too complex to make such changes while in the pattern buffers...it's easier to prevent a certain organism from being transported than it is to rebuild that organism in transport. ]</i></font><br><br>I distinctly remember an episode (or a film, it's all a blur) where someone was recreated from an old transporter image. He (probably Kirk) had forgotten everything that had transpired since he was killed (some sort of transporter accident&#8230;), or his molecules were scattered about the universe or something&#8230; <br><br>Anyhow&#8230; they can make pork chops with that thing, they could probably recreate me&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000116.html"><b>EverQuest: Plot & Story</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor emitted: "But for the new player, who has never seen the old content, the fact that Qeynos is 'new' won't add much to the value of the game for them. Whereas new content is new for everyone." <br><br>In one sense, you're very right. I was partying with some folks the other day who started playing about a year ago, and I mentioned something about "since Kithicor was changed". They were completely confused, especially when I told them that Kith used to be a n00bie zone. To newer players, it's almost as if Bloody Kithicor never happened. (That's a sad fact, but is beside the point of what I'm getting at here.) <br><br>In another sense, this isn't the whole truth. For example, even after two years of being involved in EverQuest, my highest-level character is at 21. I'm certainly not high enough level to experience a large portion of the game, and that includes much of the content that was released new since EQ's release in 1999: most of the Planes, Velious, and much of Kunark. <br><br>You can go on releasing new high-level content, and you can tweak and change the existing high-level content as much as you like, but it'll be new to me once I finally get there. The question is really whether new players will be more likely to stick with EQ and derive more enjoyment from their low-level play if the low-level content is updated and redesigned as well. <br><br>Another way to look at it is, if you change Qeynos Hills or Misty Thicket or Butcherblock Mountains, you're updating content accessible by nearly the entire player base, and what's more, you're updating around a pre-existing structure, taking care of most of the work of content development. When you do another add-on or change some underused zone in the depths of Velious, you're excluding a lot of casual gamers from experiencing our ever-changing Norrath. <br><br>The plague of Bertoxxulous in the Karanas is a great example of the sorts of things that should be going on all the time in EverQuest. Huge expansions of high-level content may be more exciting from a press-release standpoint, but as game designers, it's just as important that the entire game be kept exciting. To be honest, I'm quite surprised that Freeport has yet to be taken over by Dark Elves (or the same for Neriak).... :)<br><br>Well, I got long winded too (hehehe!), so I'll be done now. :)<br><br>Nizanko Seigikan<br>21st Shaman of The Tribunal<br>Norrathian's Justice, Solusek Ro ]</i></font><br><br>While Misty is certainly accessible to nearly everyone, it's not used by everyone&#8230; <br><br>The Plague is certainly the sort of thing that we'd like to do more of. <br><br>And I'd be pretty shocked if the folks in Freeport could manage the firepower to take Neriak, that place is a fortress. Freeport, on the other hand, is as defensible as Swiss cheese. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First a coment. I agree the adding more content has it's vaule of expanding the world and creating new places to explore. But changing the exiting content makes it feel alive. Ever expanding content adds bredth, altering existing content adds depth. I am a huge fan of the game and salute the abitious expansions to add bredth. However, I and probably a large majority of long time players, would like to see more depth. I would even trade a new zone for a monthly change in content. It doesn't always have to be major, but something should be changing out there. More than it is now. <br><br>Second, our (as players) creating the story. I'll drink to that! I have been runinng and participating in weekly "raids" for more than a year now with a group that started at level 4 "raiding" blackburrow. We crawl dungeons, scour countrysides and generally make the most of the content that is there. We try to follow or create story lines that go with these weekly adventures and have found a wealth of places to do so. But, what we are doing is artificially inserting stories over the existing environment. What we lack are additional tools. <br><br>For instance: We recently had a story of a character dissapearing. After some research she was discovered to have been captured by the Kly and being converted in Delnir. So, we went on a rescue mission to save her. This fit nicely with the content already avaialable. But, what we wanted to do (in the story) was do a sort of "upside down" crawl. We wanted to put the hapless victem in the bottom of Delnir and have the party "ported" to her location with no knowledge of their location. (as the story unfolded the group still did not know where we were going to fight that night) In doing so they would then need to fight their way out of a dungeon with no maps, no idea where they were and a party member that was "off". (Hugging Kly believers and then attacking them) <br><br>For reasons I understand from a "big picture" point of view we couldn't get a GM to port us into the bottom of Delnir. Still, it would have REALLY helped the story line. The GM's wanted to, but it was a violation of policy. <br><br>My VERY long winded point is this. GM's need to be given a little more freedom to help players out that are working to create a story line. We all would have gladly agreed to not petition for help, corpse recovery or anything if the GM had been able to help us out. We were accepting a wild risk for some great fun. We belonged in Delnir. We were of the apropriate level and size, so we were not abusing the powers. It was clear to everyone including the GM's, but their hands were still tied. <br><br>Free the GM's! (hehehehe) <br><br>Ziff Harbinger<br>Dusk Eternal<br>Ayonae Ro ]</i></font><br><br>Unfortunately we just don't have one GM for every 6 players, like we usually to playing pen and paper. And we are also constrained but the fact that this game has to be played on the computer, not in our heads. <br><br>So, as players, you have to be more clever (and, sometimes, less creative) with your story lines. You have to try harder to work within the restrictions of the game. <br><br>We'd like nothing more than to have a game flexible enough that your capture scenario would have worked. That would probably be a good goal for any game like ours to try to make possible.</UL>

Perhaps the greatest mystery surrounding the upcoming expansion has finally been answered by Alan.  In his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000117.html">latest update</a> to the Developer's Corner he informs us of the correct way to pronounce Luclin:<UL><b><i>When I first saw reference to the upcoming expansion, I pronounced it with a soft "u" and "c" sounding as "k," in other words Luclin = "Luck*lin." The more I thought on it, the less sure I felt. A friend said she thought it was pronounced with a hard "u" and "c" sounding as "s", or Luclin = "Loose*lin." This sounded better to me, but several coworkers confused the issue by agreeing with the hard "u" but reverting to "k," Luclin = "Luke*lin." As I rule out a soft *u* and *s* (Luss*lin?) combo, which of the other three is correct?<br><br>Thanks =)</b></i><br><br>This I can answer. It's pronounced LuckLynn. You were right the first time.<br><br>Alan</UL>Hey, it's a start. :)
