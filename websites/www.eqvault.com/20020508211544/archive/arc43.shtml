The Druid cap was raised on TEST SERVER. No changes to Druid tracking have been made to live servers. Please stop posting this kind of inaccurate nonsense.]</i></font><br><br>True, this is only on Test right now. And you folks all need to be aware that stuff on Test will not always go live. <br><br>But I can explain why Druid tracking might be getting an increase. It's really the same reason that it was always lower than a Bard's skill before. Before all the cool changes to tracking it was actually better to have a lower skill number than a higher one, unless you had a really high skill. Basically, because there was no scrolling, Bards with their slightly higher skill were actually worse at tracking than druids because the higher skill would create a lot of clutter. This was done at the request of the Druid community. <br><br>So the plan is to raise the Druid cap so that they are still better at tracking than Bards. That's the plan anyway.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061249-2.html"><b>Whiniest Class in Norrath Poll</b></a><br>Sorry folks, but I'm closing this one.

They pull 4 mobs and make sure they hit them all. Then the cleric casts CH and the mobs all aggro onto the cleric. If someone puts a dam shield on the cleric the mobs will all die and the warrior will get credit.<br>It also means that although we can't kill the top mobs anymore, we have now given Clerics the BEST area taunt in the game. If the mobs can't summon, the cleric can do a CH and as long as the cleric is faster than the MOB [snares?] stay out of range. The other party memebers attack the mobs. When the aggro off the cleric the cleric does CH again.<br><br>I haven't had time to think this out yet, but I bet Verant didn't even give it a thought.

Can we expect ALL Debuff spells, despite their specific debuff nature to be affected or does this only apply to those listed in the patch message?]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, it should include and spell that has a non-damage component, like Snare and Flame Lick. But the reduction for these spells might not be as big as those for the pure debuff spells like Malo and Tash. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Lastly, not related to the patch...

Hate was being calculated in a screwy way for healing, and we fixed it to be more in line with the way it should work. Yes, healers now have to be more careful with their healing. <br><br>BUT! It's not going to mean the end of clerics in Norrath. For lower level clerics it's unlikely you'll even notice the change at all. And for higher level clerics, well, you probably won't notice it either. But at least now the NPCs will be aware of how powerful the effects of healing are. Someone stated it this way in a tuning meeting (and stealing good lines from my co-workers is part of my job): Just think about how angry it makes you when you've nearly got Vox dead and she casts a Complete Heal. <br><br>I only ask that you try it out before getting too upset about it. <br><br>Nirran wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What happened to enchanter concerns?

Yet you havent replied to that at all - if the problem isnt there (we proved it isnt) then why must you make a change?]</i></font> <br><br>I can only assume that you are talking about the idea that a successful evade would move you to the bottom of the 'hate' list, even if that was below someone that had only just been noticed by the NPC, and how the increase of the length of the 'hate' list made this too powerful. It's the truth. The problem with each of the arguments that have 'disproved' it this is that they all relied on one basically false assumption. The assumption is that your position on the 'hate' list is the only determining factor about whether you are attacked or not. I never claimed that an NPC would charge across the zone to attack someone it had only just met if the rogue managed a successful evade. The fact that the rogue was on the bottom of a huge hate list was true, and it is not refuted by experience, only by a few false assumptions. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: B) Your proposed fix (moving the rogues effectively to the #2 slot), has been shown to be severely defective, especially in the case of large raids, where there are more than 2 rogues. It will result in the rogues rotating at the TOP of the hate list, and therefore dying rapidly - or sucking down so much healing that they become a detriment to a raid, and will be excluded as they were in the past, in favor of warriors. Even Rangers, who can "jolt" their way down a hate list far faster than rogues can with your evade nerf, will be preferred because at least they can do high damage, self heal and get out of the aggro range quickly all by themselves. Why did you not address this concern?]</i></font> <br><br>You are behind the times on the fix. You are underinformed. Let me give you the full details. <br><br>'If Evading while at the top of the hate list, you will still be moved between the current #2 and #3 person on the hate list. In addition, if the amount of hate reduction calculated is less than 500 actual points, it becomes 500.' <br><br>I urge you to realize that this will, in all cases, be at least as effective as Jolt, most often more so. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: C)A lot of high level rouges, people who have played this game since Beta, have posted and pointed out some erroneous assumptions in how you thingk the game mechanics actually work in practice on a live server. How Evade doenst work as often or as well as you seem to think it does. They posted logs, they posted anectodal evidence, and they backed it up with reasoned explanations of why Live is different from what you and your staff see in the code. Yet you didnt acknowledge that you might be in error, or address why what we see in game contradicts what you claim to have a problem with. Why didnt you address this?]</i></font> <br><br>I acknowledged only that we wouldn't let it go live if it wasn't working well enough. My suggestion would be a simple one. Go try it. See if it works any worse than it did before (before the hate list change). Try it out, rather than worrying about the theory of it. That's what we did&#8230; <br><br>Tieny wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Has anyone actually played with the change or spoken to Rogues from test?

I suppose I'm disappointed in the responses here. We certainly did listen to the players. But the fact that Evade was going to be changed was never up for debate. Suggesting that I was somehow being disingenuous by not stopping the Evade change is unfair. It was broken, and it was going to be changed. But we certainly used feedback from Test Server players and folks on the Safehouse when we made the changes. <br><br>I can't stress this enough. Try using Evade. Proclaim your doom only if you see that your rogue is completely useless by actually playing. It's rather unfortunate to claim that we don't know what is going on in the game when you have not actually tried the changes yourself.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059756-2.html"><b>Verant Going "Nerf Crazy" Again?</b></a><br>Thogg wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: OMG well they are totaly clueless once again.<br>I have a epic nothing has a higher taunt of a proc then that.

The change only affects that were debuff procs and things like that. I suppose the patch message wasn't clear about that, though I also suppose the it would have only taken you a few moments of play time to discover it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Lol UM no way in hell a greater caussed no more hate then a ch.

But we never said that Greater Heal was causing as much aggro as Complete Healing. However, it was close. I'm not going into details and again I would suggest that you play with the new changes before making these rather wild accusations. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Agresive is now a nice dicipline but defensive has been wiped out its USELESS when you use this discipline you are supposed to be abel to cut your adamage taken.]</i></font> <br><br>There was no change to the defensive part of the Defensive discipline.

You will find that the game makes a lot more sense this way. A warriors ability to taunt has only been reduced when using a few specific weapons. Clerics will discover that they can easily adjust to the change. And Defensive was broken. <br><br>I fail to understand why it is that some people think it is our desire to harm the game. That makes no sense to me. These changes will work to make a better game, not a worse one. <br><br>In all of this, my point is that perhaps you all should play with these changes before proclaiming so loudly that we made a mistake. See how it works first.</UL>

Alan sent me an important note regarding Shralok Packs and the current status of the servers you should all read before attempting to login today:<UL><i>Hello everyone.<br><br>During the patch today we made a change that we should have announced a<br>while ago.<br><br><b>"1--- The Shralok Pack is now LORE. It was set to pending-lore some time<br>ago."</b><br><br>Unfortunately we failed to give you any specific warning about this change<br>in advance.  What this means is that if you have two or more of these packs<br>when you log in, all but one of them and everything in them will be deleted.<br><br>Even though this item has been marked as pending lore for a while, we still<br>feel that we should have given you more warning before making this change.<br>Because some characters may lose several items when these packs are deleted,<br>we are now taking steps to alleviate this problem.<br><br>We will be taking the servers down in small groups in order to return this<br>item to its 'pending lore' status.  If you had a Shralok Pack with items in<br>it and it was deleted, please contact your server GM and let him or her<br>know.  They will do their best to restore the lost items.<br><br>I have also just been told that one of the facilities that provides our<br>access to the Internet has lost power.  This has made several of our servers<br>unavailable.  We will bring those servers back on line with the Shralok Pack<br>restored to pending lore.<br><br>I'm sorry about this error.  We are doing everything in our power to correct<br>this mistake.<br><br>But please, keep in mind that items marked as 'pending lore' are marked that<br>way because they will be turned to 'lore' items.  It is best that you don't<br>gather more than one of any item marked as 'pending lore'.  We will always<br>try to notify you when we plan to change such an item to 'lore', but you<br>need to understand that the change to 'lore' could happen at any time.<br><br>Once the servers have been brought down and the item returned to 'pending<br>lore' status, you will be able to log in without losing the packs, or the<br>items in them.<br><br>Alan</I></UL>Thanks Alan!

This message went up this morning on the EQ Patch Server:<UL>February 21th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Today's patch contains a wide variety of enhancements and changes.  Due to the number of changes being made, this list is primarily a summary.  Extended descriptions of the changes and the reasoning behind them can be solicited on the EverQuest Message Boards.<br><br>*Spell and Skill Changes*<br><br>Druids, Shaman, and Clerics:<br>--- Superior Healing moved to level 51 for shamans and druids.  <br>--- Casting difficulty of Superior Heal reduced (less fizzles)<br>--- New level 55 Druid and shaman spell, Chloroblast, similar to remedy for clerics.<br>--- New Druid spell at level 60, upgrade to superior healing, Natures Touch.<br>--- Created a new spell effect for Celestial Healing, Celestial Elixir, and Torpor.  This will allow them to stack with all other spells, save spells of the same type (Heal over time).  Prior to this, all heal-over-time spells followed the same rules as regeneration spells.<br>--- Reduced the casting difficulty of Remedy.<br>--- Lowered recast time on Wake of Karana<br><br>Paladins:<br>--- Added Endure Magic spell at level 30<br>--- Added Resist Magic at 55<br>--- Moved Guard spell from 49 to 39<br>--- Moved Armor of Faith from 53 to 49<br>--- Added New level 53 paladin spell: Divine Glory<br>--- Added New level 59 spell: Celestial Cleansing <br>--- Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors<br>--- Added Yaulp 4 at 60 and enhanced.<br><br>Shadowknights:<br>--- Removed artificially inflated mana cost for pre level 50 lifetap spells.  Please note that post-50 lifetap spells never had an inflated mana cost.<br>--- Moved Spirit Tap to level 55<br>--- Moved Drain Spirit to level 57<br>--- Added Drain Soul at level 60<br>--- Grim Aura added at level 22 and enhanced<br>--- Moved Shieldskin to level 34<br>--- Pet buff added at 29<br>--- Added Diamondskin spell at 59<br>--- Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors<br>--- Due to the recent improvements to "Harmtouch", it is doing much more damage than it would before and unbalances PvP.  As such it will now do less damage in PvP (68% of PvE, down from 80%).  In addition, Shadowknights on the PvP servers were routinely killing themselves via non-XP losing means and attacking other players with Harmtouch immediately upon respawn.  In order to address this situation, Harmtouch is no longer automatically "recharged" by death on the PvP Servers.<br>--- The "Lifeleech" discipline now increases hit probability in addition to its other effects.<br><br><br>Rangers:<br>--- Added Endure Cold at 22<br>--- Added Skin Like Nature at 59<br>--- Added FireFist at 22<br>--- Moved Bramblecoat from 49 to 39<br>--- Added Spikecoat at 49<br>--- Added resist cold at 55<br>--- Added Panic Animal at 22<br>--- Moved Jolt to 51<br>--- Moved Spirt of Wolf from 39 to 30<br>--- Added Cinder Jolt (fire-based Jolt spell) at 55.<br>--- Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors<br>--- Added See Invisible at 39<br><br>Bards:<br>--- Added new level 20 Bard Song: Cassindra`s Chant of Clarity<br>--- Bards defensive skill made exactly the same as a warriors<br>--- Changed it so that the bard spell Denon's Desperate Dirge to increase damge by 10pts per level over 45. Also made it so the spell does 20% more damage using the Puretone discipline.<br><br>Magicians:<br>--- Added new level 59 spell: Valiant Companion<br>--- Added new level 39 spell: Summon Companion<br>--- Rain spells no longer count pets against total number of entities they can damage (all rain spells)<br>--- Added level 29 spell for Mages: Expedience<br><br>Enchanters: <br>--- Lowered recast time on Visions of Grandeur<br><br>*Bug Fixes*<br><br>--- Aggressive and Defensive disciplines have been fixed.  Before they would only affect damage taken and not affect damage dealt out.  Now they affect both as designed.<br>--- Fixed the bug with going to the spellbook when the inventory window was up in fullview mode. It should work now. Also, fixed a minor bug where if you were in normal mode and tried to go to the spellbook from inventory via /book or the keymapped key it would not go, and it would make the done button not work properly for the inventory mode.<br>--- Fixed NPC melee ranges to be the same as for player characters.  In other words, if you can hit the NPC, he can hit you.  This bug was a problem with one dragon that could be hit, but could not hit back.<br>--- Fixed a bug that made it impossible to "Call of the Hero" someone out of water or lava.<br>--- Fixed the proc on the Chilled Scythe.  Owners of this item will need to swap it out with a GM.<br>--- The Kromzek Surveyor Scope now fits in the "Ranged" slot rather than the "Ammo" slot as before.<br>--- Fixed a bug that caused the two single-target bard snare songs to break too soon in some cases.<br>--- Fixed a bug whereby NPCs would consider the race of a player prior to the loading of the faction table upon zoning or logging in.  This would cause people to be attacked by things that normally like them.  <br>--- Players should now be properly removed from the group regardless of how they exit the game.<br><br>*Misc Changes*<br><br>--- Added text labels to the fullview inventory window "body" slots (Available only to Velious Subscribers)<br>--- Added the ability to toggle those labels on and off. Use /invwinlabels [on/off] (or no arguments to toggle). This is saved in the eqclient.ini file in the [Defaults] section with the key InvWinLabels=[TRUE/FALSE]<br>--- Increased the pre-50 bind-wounds cap for rogues and warriors.<br>--- Pickpocket now works to a max of 5 levels below you, or level 45...whichever is greater... You can pickpocket NPC up to level 55 if you are level 60. <br>--- The mouse pointer will now move at a multiple of its normal speed when you adjust the MousePointerSpeedMod setting in the eqclient.ini file.  You can set that multiple on-the-fly with the /mousespeed command.<br>--- The "AutoHelp" feature that can be set under the options menu has been enhanced.  Spell casters in particular might want to turn it on and try depressing the ALT key.  It's perfect for refreshing your memory in regards to your spell lineup.<br>--- If you are interrupted while trying to cast a spell that uses a component, you will no longer use that component.  Jewelers should be very pleased with this change.<br>--- Reduced the casting difficulty (fizzle rate) of all spells over level 56.  Spells have always previously been set up so that it's usually more efficient to use a spell from a previous circle than the current one.  The formula did not take into account the fact that everyone stops at 60.<br>--- Changed it so that players will now lose experience when they die in the Arena in Kael Drakkel.  It seems that people were fighting giants in that arena in order to avoid the death penalty.<br>--- Naked PC corpses that have experience and are above level 30 will now last 3 hours instead of 3 minutes.<br>--- Avatar and Focus of Spirit should now stack<br>--- Raised the pre and post 50 bind wounds cap for paladins, clerics, druids, and shaman.<br><br>*Item Changes*<br><br>--- The effect on the "Frost Giant Beard" can now be used at 35th level rather than level 50.<br>--- The Wurmslayer will now fit in a bag. <br>--- Iksar can now use the Ashenbone Shield<br>--- Chandged Crystallized Shadow leggings to rentable<br>--- Changed Gorilla Hide Leggings to show up as leather, was cloth before<br>--- Changed Envy from a piercing weapon to a shield so players could Bash with it. Envy is a parrying dagger.<br>--- The Shralok Pack is now LORE.  It was set to pending-lore some time ago.<br>--- The Guardian and Sentry Armor bracers are no longer LORE.<br>--- Donal's Breastplate can now only be used on any individual target once every 7.5 minutes.  This addresses some of the balance issues that became apparent given the existence of a mana-free complete heal.<br><br>*Trades and Crafts*<br><br>--- Fixed the Gator Roll baking recipe.<br>--- Repaired the notetext instructions for creating a Mixing Bowl with pottery. --- Repaired Holgresh Fur Cap and Holgresh Fur Moccasins tailoring recipes.<br>--- Made it so that the file is returned in addition to the hammer when a character fails to forge any of the various chain jointings.<br>--- Repaired Recipe for Enchanted Tier`Dal Adamantite Bracelet<br>--- Made it so that the Dwarven Smithy Hammer is returned on a failure to forge Brellium Chain Jointing.<br>--- Repaired Field Plate Boots smithing recipe<br>--- Changed the name of the smithed Enchanted Cabilis Scale armor to Imbued Cabilis Scale armor for naming convention reasons.<br>--- Repaired the recipe for converting 3 Enchanted Large Adamantite Bricks into 1 Enchanted Block of Adamantite in the Tier`Dal Forge, it was previously only possible in the Oggok Forge.<br>--- Made it so that the Bread Tin is returned upon a failure to bake bread.<br>--- Mithril and Velium Bonings will be stackable.<br>--- Mithril Studs will be stackable.<br><br>*NPC AI - Hate*<br><br>We've made a number of changes to NPC AI, specifically to the section dealing with target-selection, or what's commonly referred to as "Hate". It is not so much that NPCs react differently to hate now than before, but that we've changed the way that hate is awarded.  <br><br>--- We reduced the amount of hate that can be caused by a proc.  Due to the high proc rates at upper levels, the amount of hate generated from procs, and the spells that were selected for those procs, made keeping the attention of the creature much too easy a task for the tank.  Simply, it nearly eliminated the challenge of keeping a foes attention at levels above 50.<br><br>--- We've capped the amount of hate that can be awarded to most casters, specifically for debuff-type spells like the Malo and Tash series.  The hate calculation for these spells takes into account the number of hitpoints of the NPC and did not "play nice" with the increased HP limit of Velious.  It explains why Enchanters, for instance, would complain that casting a Tash spell would lead to near-instant death.<br><br>--- We've redressed the amount of hate generated by heal spells.  Previously, and *partly* due to a bug, the high level heal spells such as superior heal or complete heal would generate no more hate than greater heal.  In fact, so little hate was generated by these spells that it made controlling NPC aggression trivial.  Heal spells will now generate an amount of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints actually healed.  Due to our desire to leave the lower level game more or less untouched, two separate caps have been placed for targets level 50 or below, and 51 or above.  Heal spells will generate significantly less hate for targets below level 51 than those at or above that level.<br><br>--- We've also re-evaluated ways that players have to reduce their own hate.  While spells in place to allow this are OK, the Evade skill (possessed by rogues) let them out of their damage too easily.  A rogue that successfully evaded would immediately drop to a level of hate lower than someone who was in the awareness range, but hadn't done anything to really upset the creature such as damage it or heal its foe.  This problem was exacerbated by the increase of the size of the hate list implemented with Velious.  <br><br>*Tracking*<br><br>Tracking now works in full view for all classes that can use it, and sports a nifty scroll bar that allows players to see everything on the list.  In addition, the /trackplayer setting is now saved to the eqclient.ini file.<br><br>The following options have been put in for Rangers only:<br><br>--- /tracksort <normal/distance/consider/rconsider/rdistance> <br>--- /trackfilter <red/yellow/white/blue/green><br><br>*/tracksort options beginning with R are reverse order<br><br>*Hybrid Casting*<br><br>Hybrids that cast spells in combat were taking double penalties at higher levels.  The casting times of their spells went up, and the amount of melee damage they do per second went up.  This results is having to take longer to cast spells, and losing more damage/second for each second taken in casting.  To help offset this, Rangers, Paladins and Shadowknights casting non-beneficial spells that have casting times greater than or equal to 3 seconds, now get a 3 % reduction in casting time for each level over 50.  3% at 51, 6% at 52, etc., to 30% at 60.  Again, this applies only to non-beneficial spells. <br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Dewman sent me this report of a recent GM event on Cazic-Thule:<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, that was a fun night folks. I was playing my Warrior in Lake of Ill Omen in the very early morning of Monday, Febuary 19, when things got out of hand with /ooc and /shout going across the chat screen. It got pretty nasty and someone /petitioned to the GM complaining about it since the immature ones would not keep quiet and let all the players enjoy the game. <br><br>Well, the GM got the /petition and decided to something about it. 3 GMs came in the zone in the form of Goblins. One was a Goblin Warrior, a Goblin Caller, and a Goblim Spiritist. They started slaughtering players under lvl 30 in the zone. Before the event began, a white text scrolled on the screen and it said... <br><br><b>"You noisy humans! Bad humans! We make you quiet now! Muhahahaha!!" </b><br><br>Initially I had agreed to this solution to teach the blabbermouths a lesson. I wanted to join in and aid the Goblins to slaughtered their enemies. I found the Spiritist and begged him to let me join them and heheh, no go, he rooted me and the Warrior came along hit me for 100s and killed me, heheh. No big deal there. There was no exp loss for me, but it was funny though. <br><br>I went back to my corpse and looted all my stuff and saw the Spiritist again and said hello to him and the Warrior snuck up on me and a trade window popped open. He gave me a Runed Lava Pendant. It was AC 5, Str +6, SV Posion +5. I was gonna thank him, but he was gone. I realized later he was invisible. He gave alot of people different prizes during the whole time. <br><br>This was my very first event and all the months I've played, I've never had the fortune to have been there until that night. Especially receiving a prize. I'll always cherish it. Unfortunantly, in all this excitement, I forgot to take screen shots. DOH! <br><br>In any rate, it was a night to remember and I thought I share this with everyone.:) <br><br>~Dewman~</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

More summaries of the "Class Talk" threads were posted by Alan on the various class-genre forums on EQ.com:<UL><i>About these lists:<br><br>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team. This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<br><br>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here. Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests. Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<br><br>All items are currently marked with NONE for status. Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server. I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team. I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<br><br>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made. So this list is not final. But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change. At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<br><br>Thanks for the input so far.<br><br>Alan</I><br><UL><strong><U>Hybrid Classes</U></strong><LI><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668.html">Ranger Talk Item List</a></b><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670.html"><b>Shadow Knight Talk Item List</b></a><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666.html"><b>Paladin Talk Item List</b></a><br><br><strong><u>Fighters/Melee Classes</u></strong><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456.html"><b>Rogue Talk Item List</b></a><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458.html"><b>Warrior Talk Item List</b></a><br><br><strong><u>Healer Classes</u></strong><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396.html"><b>Shaman Talk Item List</b></a><br><br><strong><u>Casters</u></strong><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000779.html"><b>Necromancer Talk Item List</b></a><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784.html"><b>Wizard Talk Item List</b></a></UL></UL>
