Alan on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000265.html" target="_blank">Developer's Corner Forum</a>:<br><blockquote><b>In your last post a player made a comment about how it takes player exploit before you fix a bug. I found it unreasonable that you dodged the underlying question. I believe the intent of that player was to complain about the fact that existing bugs are almost entirly ignored until people find a way to use it to their advantage. There exist many bugs that have no exploitable factors (because they are broken beyond use) that have been around since the creation of the game. If we found a way to exploit the ability to agro Pain and Suffering in certain zones it would be fixed next patch. If penalty levels caused people to /petition hundreds of times a day you would pay attention. If the bug that makes your hat dissappear when an illusion wears off caused you to become invincible there would be an emergency patch. However, instead of fixing these things we get updates to the manual and silly games like gems.<br><br>The accusations of you of acting like an out of control gm is because most exploitable bugs are discovered when rare encounters are pulled off more easily then you intended and you take action. If this problem was only being exploited in West Commonlands then it would never be discovered and if it was there would most likly be no action because its low on the radar.<br><br>Why not give us some legitimate bug fixes instead of new buggy code that nobody asked for.</b><br><br>That's a hard appearance to avoid or to dispel.<br><br>You are right, most <b>notable</b> exploitable bugs are discovered when rare encounters are pulled off more easily than intended. That is because most bugs are caught in-house and never make it to a live server. The ones that do tend to be the ones that can only be discovered by the intense scrutiny of a few thousand dedicated players. And when we fix those bugs the fix is usually accompanied by a reaction similar to the one we're seeing now about Kael.<br><br>The reality is a little different than the appearance.<br><br>We've known about and have been working on the pet aggro thing for a while, long before our change to Kael. Our schedule for fixing it hasn't really changed because of anything done in Kael. It's a bug, and it's being fixed.<br><br>We are just as likely to take a similar action for a bug that is causing problems for the player. But nobody talks about those. If charming things in Kael was causing the charmer to suddenly explode, we could do something similar to what we did here and make it so that charm can't be cast in the city. But players would stop charming things in Kael even if we didn't change the code in that case. And if we turned off charm in the zone to keep player characters from exploding there wouldn't be a big ruckus about it. Most players wouldn't hear a word about it (except from those that had exploded &#8211; they'd have a right to complain&#8230;).<br><br>If a bug like this was being abused in West Commons and we heard about it, we'd take the same action. But you are right, if we don't hear about it, we can't fix it. There is a tendency for folks to not tell us about things that are broken in their favor. I guess that's human nature. And maybe that's where the sense of conflict comes from. We want to fix all the bugs. But people are more inclined to tell us about the ones that affect them negatively and not the ones that make things easier for them.<br><br>I understand that it's probably easier to see a bug that affects you negatively than one that helps you. And most certainly in this case there was plenty of poor communication on our part to make things worse. Again, I'm sorry about that.<br><br>But that doesn't mean that this isn't a bug. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't fix it. And that doesn't mean that we should allow people to use a bug to their benefit. Though maybe it's really the last part that some players disagree with us about, and maybe that's where the accusations of pettiness come in.<br><br>But we feel that it's important that bugs don't affect the game one way or the other. We're always going to be upset when we let a bug into the game. But we're not going to be upset when someone accomplishes something in game. I can't stress this enough, but we build these encounters to be used, not to be impossible. And we want people to do the hard things in game. But at the same time we want those things to be accomplished without the use of bugs.<br><br>I don't know that I can explain it any better than that.<br><br>And, well, Auric and I put a lot of work into that manual&#8230;<br><br><br><b>speaking of pet agro, when will it be fixed? i'm still going trough about 10 times more malachite than i once was. honestly my pet got me DT'd in PoA yesterday because of pet agro. I was /assisting the Keeper of Souls to DS whoever he happened to be hitting, and out of about 15-20 tanks almost all of which were 50+ the KoS was beating on my poor little air pet Jabober. As much of a help as this is becuase pets are easier to replace than tanks are, i'd like it to be fixed so in a seb group i'm not using the 15+ malachite per day that i'm using now. <br><br>ps. when i got DT'd my pet was taunting, i forgot to tell him not to but in all my seb groups my pets never taunt.</b><br><br>Hopefully we'll get it with the patch next week.<br><br><br><b>"There are times when we aren't aware of a bug until a few hundred thousand people start looking for them."<br><br>Not to be hyper critical, but I think this statement in a nutshell gets to the heart of why people are frustrated with Verant. We're not looking for bugs, we're just trying to play the game. Everytime something doesn't work out like you thought it would, doesn't mean someone was trying to thwart your efforts.</b><br><br>That's absolutely true, when something doesn't work like we though it would that doesn&#8217;t immediately imply that someone is trying to thwart out efforts. And we're not saying they are.<br><br>There are, however, people that would rather use a bug than report it. Those people are trying to thwart our efforts. Our 'efforts' in this case are to eliminate bugs.<br><br>But there are also plenty of people that are just playing and when something works well they have no way of knowing that it is a bug that makes it work so well. And we don't expect players to know everything that is and is not a bug.<br><br>Your message seems to imply that we've taken some sort of action against players that were using this bug. We have not. We've prevented it from being used in one zone until we can get it fixed, that's all.<br><br><b>Though it may not pertain to many of us, we sometimes want to kjnow what the heck you are talking about. Can you explain what the exploit and bug were? Since its gone now anyway.</b><br><br>I don't really want to detail any bug that still exists in game. It's not gone yet, and Kael isn't the only place it could be used, it's just the place where it can be used most effectively.</blockquote>

Alan on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&number=1&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=">Developer's Corner Board</a>:<br><blockquote><b>"Most of you are aware that there is still a bit of a bug with the way pets work in the aggro code."<br>Until this moment, no one I know was aware the pet problems were actual bugs, and not intended by Verant. The current pet aggro code is the result of a re-patch to repair a problem introduced several patches ago. There have been a couple patches since then, and the aggro code has not changed. How are we to know that Verant considers these bugs?<br><br>Since Verant has not announced that the pet aggro code was bugged, I do not feel that anyone using the current aggro can be considered to be exploiting.<br><br>The dictionary definition of exploit is "To make use of selfishly or unethically." It is arguable that any tactic that kills any MOB is inherently selfish since killing a MOB denies it to everyone else, so the only relevant aspect of this definition is the "unethically" part. The only way someone can do something unethical is with prior knowledge of a standard. Since Verant has never announced that pet aggro was bugged, then no one could know that using pet aggro features was abuse.<br><br>We don't have the benefit of a "list of bugs" that you in Verant do. Unless you tell us, we can never know if one thing is a bug, or working as planned. Please don't assume that we know things are bugs unless you have alerted us to the fact.</b><br><br>You are correct.<br><br>And that is exactly why we chose to turn off the ability to 'exploit' this bug and have taken no action against those that were using it. Because it's easy to see how a player might not have known there was still a bug, we are assuming that nobody did, and therefore we aren't accusing anyone of any wrongdoing. If I somehow implied that, I'm sorry. That wasn't my intent. I certainly didn't use the word 'exploit' in my post, for exactly that reason.<br><br><br><b>Why is it that on a continous basis players have to use a change VI makes to their advantage before it is considered a bug? While necromancers and mages has been complaining since the agro change patch (June?) that pets over agro. Something that has been fixed in several patches since then with little to no change. Yet, now a guild managed to use this change (not a bug as you said, but an INTENTIONAL, and announced, change on your part how pets work), it is instantly changed so the tactic can not be used.<br><br>May I suggest using some sort of version control software and revert the changes back to how it was before the pet agro change? Seems to me that would change the problem in Kael.</b><br><br>This is where a lot of the confusion seems to occur.<br><br>We've been aware of and working on the pet aggro bug since the last patch where we thought we had it fixed (which, as others have pointed out, was July 10th). We haven't increased our work on fixing the bug because of anything going on in Kael. Sometimes it just takes a while to nail down and fix something like this, especially when so much else is going on.<br><br>As for players having to 'use a change' we make to their advantage before we'll consider it a bug, that is indeed sometimes the case. There are times when we aren't aware of a bug until a few hundred thousand people start looking for them. Yes, when we find players doing something using a function of the game engine that we hadn't anticipated, we have to evaluate it and see what we think.<br><br>Let us imagine that there was a weapon that proc'ed a new spell effect that turned the enemy purple. Internally we test that weapon and find that it does indeed turn the enemy purple. We also test it in combats here and there and nothing odd happens. After all, it only turns someone purple, how much trouble could it cause. So it goes in game.<br><br>Then players find it. At first only a few have it and they use it rarely. After all, it only turns enemies purple. But when more of them come into the game, someone uses it against a snow orc. He's already purple. So maybe the spell code decides that if something is already purple, it will become invisible when affected by this new spell.<br><br>Ok, not likely, but this is just an example.<br><br>We hear about it. Now, this is obviously a bug, the intent was not that the weapon would make snow orcs invisible. But we could decide that it is indeed a feature and leave it in.<br><br>But until we know that this weapon makes snow orcs invisible, we can't make that decision.<br><br>So there are certainly times when we declare something a bug only after players discover something. If the sword instantly killed any purple enemy every time it proc'ed, then calling it a bug might appear to be taking some 'clever' trick away from the players. In reality, it's still a bug.<br><br>The pet aggro thing is a bug. The fact that players have found a way to use it to their advantage doesn't make it less of a bug. And it still needs fixing.<br><br><br><b>My only request is that you overcommunicate major changes like this, particularly if they are done in a hurry. It is critical that the player base have a sense that things are done for a reason and not whimsically.</b><br><br>Well, we most certainly should have mentioned the change. But you and I could probably debate the notion of 'major changes'. This is one zone among more than 100. The change is only going to affect a small number of players, and only for a short time. I don't disagree, we should have mentioned it. But this isn't any sort of major change.<br><br><br><br><b><blockquote>In Kael there are a lot of NPCs that can be charmed that are significantly more powerful than any pet. Some folks were using this combination of bug and situation to make encounters much more trivial than they were intended to be.</blockquote><br><br>I am not sure of the specifics of the encounter where Legacy of steel killed the avatar of war, but from what i have seen, it's reasonably obvious that this wasn't a trivial encounter <br>due to the 100+ corpses littering the ground around the corpse.<br><br>What i would quite like to ask is :<br>1) Is the avatar of war meant to be killable (even a tiny hint won't give away why it isn't)<br>after all, you need 80+ people to kill him, expecting to loose an excrutiating amount of experience due to the 7 or 8 deaths.<br><br>2) Wouldn't it be far easier to buff up the Avatar of war in the interim, Which won't annoy some of the smaller folks who charming is not a luxury but a neccessity in kael. I'm sure if you gave it the ability to complete heal, or gave it an AoE less people would be able to undertake it. Because after all, even though these people "may" have been exploiting with regards to the avatar of war 99.99% of the people who are in kael are there to kill it.<br><br>3) If my statement above is correct as i think it is about the firepower and number of corpses, and lets assume you wanted it to be harder, I'd hate to think of exactly how hard it would be to take down....<br><br>Anyways, i'm not personally bothered by this at all it's just i personally think this change will adversly affect the vast majority when only trying to stop the vast minority if you see what i'm getting at )</b><br><br>If we wanted something to be unkillable, it would be unkillable. I've read a lot of accusations on the Internet and comments to the Developer's Corner that we are like a bunch of pre-teen D&D Dungeon Masters that take the death of some NPC or another personally and feel the need to strike back.<br><br>That is, frankly, a load of &#8230;<br><br>We've certainly made some NPCs very hard. That was intentional. But we're not going to take anything personally about the death of that NPC. Not only is that just silly, but it's not a very reasonable assumption.<br><br>Keep in mind that we aren't a team of one person. There are a bunch of us here. Things like the change to Kael aren't up to one person to do. A designer and a coder, minimally, would be needed to make the changes we made to Kael. If this mythical juvenile game designer were actually working here, he'd have no chance to affect his petty changes.<br><br>Yes, we put a lot of effort and thought into creating the zones, NPCs and quests for players to experience. And, yes, there is a sense of pride when something is done well. But we build this stuff to be interacted with, not just be looked at. We want players to experience the content that the team slaved so hard to build.<br><br>And the assumption that this change is only about the Avatar of War is misguided. The problem in Kael extends to any NPC in that zone, not just the big ones.<br><br>Regardless, we don't want the Avatar of War to be harder than he was intended to be. We just want him to be as hard as he was intended to be. There's no real reason for the challenge level of any given content to be changed by a bug.<br><br>Nobody is forcing anyone to try to kill him. There's nothing wrong with an NPC being exceptionally hard to kill. We build the encounters. It's up to you to decide if you want to tackle them. And, well, heck &#8211; he is the Avatar of War. He's the essence of combat. He's supposed to be extremely powerful.<br><br><br><b>Two small notes: It sounds like you are misusing the word 'bug'. A 'bug' is different from a design problem. The charm code works normally. The pet code works normally. Everything works like it's supposed to, but you think it's unbalancing, so that would be a design problem, not a bug, right?<br><br>And secondly, it seems to most of us non-ubers that you are focusing 85% of resources and planning on 10% of the population. Time and time again, the most powerful groups in the game do something which you think abuses the game design somehow, and your reaction is to make that tactic impossible in order to protect the game. I'm all for protecting the game, but the high-level game is already too hard for everyone who isn't in an uberguild.<br><br>Maybe you should just start putting in situations and NPCs to DIRECTLY counter large groups of uber folk. Spawn a GM controlled (or normal) ubermob to specifically frustrate ubergroups doing things you want to prevent. Heck, just pop unmezzable, uncharmable high HP mobs randomly in the zone anytime an adventure zone gets more than 10 lvl 56+s.</b><br><br>You're right. Charm works as intended. Pets do what they are supposed to do. But the aggro code is not working as intended. This is, indeed, a bug.<br><br>As to your second point, we're not. In the same period that we made the change to Kael we've also done a few dozen other things. This apparent focus on the higher level stuff isn't coming from us. We make similar changes to things that come about from issues with lower level characters. But it's the players with the higher level characters that are also the more vocal.<br><br>The interesting thing here is that this "tactic" was only made possible by a bug in the code that we managed to add while trying to adjust something. This is a new thing, something that just didn't exist a few months ago. And yet, somehow, our attempts to return the code to something more like normal, like it was a few months ago, is now being called a 'nerf'&#8230;<br><br>Even more unfortunately, is that everyone seems to be ignoring the fact that the bug fix will be beneficial to pet classes all over the place. And, though I'm still receiving comments about that, the focus is suddenly all on the assumption that we're ruining a tactic used on a very few high level raid situations.<br><br>In the end, this is a bug fix. The "tactic" that we will be removing has only been possible because of this bug. The one does not exist without the other.</blockquote>

Absor on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000265.html" target="_blank">Developer's Corner</a>:<br><blockquote><b>Any chance there will some explanation of why giants in Kael can no longer be charmed? Seems odd that the zone would come down out of the blue and giants no longer charmable. Crowd control? I personally think it was a bad move since giants cannot be charmed... and I have an idea it was due to Avatar of War being killed, but I'm sure if a comment was mad it would clear things up.. Thanks!</b><br><br>I'll do my best to explain the situation.<br><br>Most of you are aware that there is still a bit of a bug with the way pets work in the aggro code. In Kael there are a lot of NPCs that can be charmed that are significantly more powerful than any pet. Some folks were using this combination of bug and situation to make encounters much more trivial than they were intended to be.<br><br>Fixing the bug will require a full patch, and a largish one at that. We weren't willing to make a large emergency patch, taking down all the servers and requiring all that downtime for our customers to fix a bug being abused in one zone.<br><br>This left us with pretty much three options.<br><br>1) Allow folks to continue to use the bug to their advantage.<br>2) Begin punishing people for using the bug until it could be patched.<br>3) Remove the ability to use the bug in the situation where it was most abusable, Kael, and then fix the bug with the next patch and remove the temporary fix.<br><br>We chose the third option.<br><br>We don't want people using bugs to their advantage. We feel that it harms the game integrity and the gameplay of those that don't use bugs to their advantage. We couldn't take option one.<br><br>We could choose option two, but policing such things requires resources, and banning people isn't something we like to do. This is a new bug, and perhaps people were unsure that it is indeed a bug. And in most circumstances this bug only changes the play style of some people. Only in a few circumstances does this bug become abusable. So fixing the specific circumstance is better than giving warnings to players.<br><br>I know the next question, and let me answer it right now. This is a new bug, and it could be argued with some conviction that players using it to their advantage were unaware that it wasn't purposeful code change. In the case of the abuse of safe zones, it is well known that using such locations is against our rules. It can't be reasonably argued that any player with a character over 50th level doesn't understand that.<br><br>In any case, we plan to fix the bug with the next patch. Until then, the NPCs in Kael will probably remain uncharmable. We understand that this adversely affects single and double group raids in that zone, and for that we are sorry. But things should be back to normal soon. Assuming anyone knows what normal is anyway&#8230;</blockquote>

From the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&number=1" target="_blank">Developer's Corner</a>:<br><blockquote><br><b><font size="+1"><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html">RP Server</a></font></b><br><b>I've been following this as closely as my real life permits <g> and felt compelled to comment on this: <br>>>While you can tell if the rogue is wearing a dark cloak (by 'inspecting' them), you can't see scars and such.<<<br><br>That's very true, and I'm glad you noted it. However I have to admit that the "inspect" message bugs the @#$% out of me. In my experience, people don't inspect to see your character story, they do it to check out, at obnoxiously close range, the make of your armor or the detailing on your sword (i.e. how many plusses you have and whether you are twinked). They usually do it without permission. And even I, as rarely as I get to play these days, have had the unpleasant experience of being accosted in this manner by someone looking to buy my hard-earned equipment right off my back. <br><br>For me, the "so-and-so is inspecting you..." line has become analogous to the creep who stands three and a half inches behind you in line, with his breath ruffling the hairs on the back of your ears .... *shudders* That's why I've taken my carefully considered character commentary OUT and replaced it with the sarcastic remark "Didn't your mother ever teach you not to stare?" Sometimes I wish Daliah could carry mace.<br><br>[b]Which is all by way of saying 1) I think the character box COULD serve a descriptive RP purpose given some of the restrictions that have been proposed (e.g. the 5x change rule), but 2) whether or not you decide to keep it, can you PLEASE let us turn off that (let's face facts) useless-for-non-PvPers message so that we don't have to experience such a constant invasion of our personal space in order to forward our stories? Not that I feel strongly about this or anything ... </b><br><br>You already can turn off the inspection message. Here's a quote from the eqmanual_supplement (highly recommended reading for everyone):<br><br><b>"ShowInspectMessage</b> = TRUE or FALSE<br><br>Sets whether or not you want the &#8220;CharacterName is inspecting you&#8221; message to be displayed when you are inspected by another character."<br><br>You can just open up your eqclient.ini and change the default TRUE to FALSE and you won't see the messages any more.<br><br><b>>>Most of the quirks that you might give your character can be shown by his or her actions in game, using emotes and such (/em scratches the scars on his cheek as he stares off at the horizon).<<<br><br>As someone else has pointed out, a language check on emotes would make the above impossible for anyone who didn't speak your language. As I pointed out in an earlier email, I think I should be able to make my female character curtsey and have everyone understand that's what the duck graphic was supposed to represent, even if they don't speak my language. I'm sure that there are thousands of other inventive, imaginative emotes that your players have dreamt up in the last couple of years. It'd be a shame to lose them all to a language barrier. The range of canned emotes provided by EQ is impressive, but can never match the imagination of a determined RPer. </b><br><br>Agreed. We don't want to lose the functionality either. But, as is always the case, it will come down to a decision about which is the lesser of two evils, losing the ability for everyone to see those emotes, or leaving an easy way to avoid the language restrictions.<br><br><b>Finally, would like to know how we can find out when this proposed server is available for testing? I've never played on a test server yet, but for this, I would. Eagerly. <br><br>Thanks for paying so much attention to our comments and concerns. It's comforting to know that even after two years, Verant has not turned its collective back on its player base. <br><br>Respectfully, <br>Daliah, Druid of Karana (19th season)<br>Rivervale, Rodcet Nife server</b><br><br>I don't have any idea.

The EverQuest Operations Team would like you to have some Code Red Virus II Information:<br><blockquote>We have become aware that the Code Red Virus is hitting the @home network particularly hard right now. Although this has nothing specifically to do with EverQuest, @home users may experience some potential network problems that could cause some degradation of their network performance. Once the Code Red virus infects a machine, it attempts to infect other machines. Users that have firewall logs may see random IP addresses attempting to access port 80 (which is the HTTP Port). This is the Code Red virus attempting to spread itself. We thought it would be a good idea to let people know about this. <br><br>*** UPDATE *** <br>It appears as though this virus is a variant of the Code Red virus called Code Red II. <br><br>*** UPDATE #2 *** <br>It looks as if this virus is all over the place now, not just on @home.

I received the following from Dynamite Shortfuze:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail, Wizards of Fennin Ro!<br><br>    I come before you once again, as I have in the past, with news of<br>this month's Wizard Faire! I have been collecting runes earnestly in<br>anticipation of this month's faire, and I hope all of you have been<br>doing the same!<br><br>    Firstly, I would like to apologize to one and all for my lack of<br>presence last month. I was there for the first half hour or so, but then<br>my ISP went down for the rest of that night and I was unable to attend<br>properly. I received several tells and emails, however, thanking me for<br>organising the event, and with a couple requests pertaining to the time.<br>These requests shall be honored, but first I would like to share with<br>you some exciting news.<br><br>    Taedirk Fyreslinger, fellow wizard of Fennin Ro, has been wanting to<br>organize a language faire, and we have decided that we could hold our<br>faires together for all wizards to benefit. To this end, we would like<br>to organise the language training area near a zone line. This must be<br>easily accessible by most, and must be in a neutral area where none<br>shall worry of being KOS. As the rune trade is normally held at the<br>Toxxulia wizard spires, Taedirk suggested that we do this at the Kerra<br>Ridge zoneline, which I feel is a good idea. If anybody has any<br>objections, or feels that there is a better place to do this, then we<br>will welcome all suggestions.<br>  <br>  At the present time, the details of the faire are as follows:<br><br>--<br><br>Where: Toxxulia Wizard spires / Kerra Ridge<br>Starts: 4 PM PST ( 7 PM EST ) Saturday 4th August<br>Finishes: When we're done! =)<br><br>--<br><br>    For newcomers to the faire, the concept is simple: bring all your<br>runes and research materials to the faire. If you are in need of a rune,<br>then ask for it, and if anyone has one they are not in need of, then you<br>will get it. Consequentially, if you have a rune that you have no need<br>of, and someone else asks for it, then it is expected that you will give<br>that rune to your fellow wizard. The language trading part, I will leave<br>to Taedirk to decide the rules at the faire, but I imagine people will<br>be split into groups of five students and one teacher and then go about<br>learning.<br><br>    This faire is held for the community, by the community, and we are<br>all here to help each other. Even if you haven't any research to do, I<br>strongly encourage you to come out and meet all your fellow wizards.We<br>can only grow stronger as a community, and we can only grow better as we<br>gain friends.<br><br>    Even though this faire is primarily geared towards wizards, I invite<br>everyone to attend. We have had mages, enchanters, even warriors and<br>monks visit us in the past, and we continue to welcome any who wish to<br>join us. The community is not restricted to any one class, and friends<br>do not come in any specific race or class.<br><br>    As I have in the past, I will put forth an effort to brew sufficient<br>refreshments to appease the masses, but I am only one person. If you<br>practice a trade skill, then I encourage you wholeheartedly to bring<br>with you the product of your trade. Taedirk, I know, makes some of the<br>finest lizard on a stick I've had yet, and I hope he will bring some of<br>his own work to share with us, as I hope that you will bring some of<br>your own.<br><br>    If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or ideas pertaining<br>to the faire, please contact me at <a href="mailto:fenninrunes@hotmail.com">fenninrunes@hotmail.com</a>. I will get<br>back to you as soon as I possibly can, and I hope to see you, one and<br>all, at the faire.<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Two updates were made on the Developer's Corner by Alan today. You can view them both here:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000257.html"><b>Sullon Zek Point System</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Question, if I ding 60 and I want to go wipe out a level ~30 dungeon and corpse camp like 10 people at a time till they're deleveled to level 20 .. Will this give negatove points to my "team" or just me? Could a single person doing this eventually drive their entire "team" into the negatives? If so, what if I made an alt on another machine and leveled him to 60 for the sole purpose of camping level 20-30 dunegons to lower THEIR points into the negatives? <br><br>I don't think I get this losing points bit.. If anything a green con kill should provide no points, otherwise this is going to be abused hardcore. And you might say "well, im sure someone will come get revenge on you" .. Sure, i'll just camp out and come back an hour later and start it all over again. <br><br>Or am I totally off base here? <br><br>-Bilden soon to be level 60 AE Wizzie ]</i></font><br><br>The level 60 is not causing any experience loss to the level 30s, so he can't de-level them. <br><br>Yes, your points reflect on your team. So if you lose 5 points, so does your team. But the idea that someone would level a character to 60th just to cause his own team to lose experience is pretty extreme, and very unlikely. Sure it's possible. <br><br>You worry that this might 'be abused hardcore'. The problem is that without a point loss for killing characters that are too low level, there will be far greater abuse. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: <br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br><br>I've had a lot of questions about points for under level 20 PvP. <br><br>There are none. <br><br>Killing someone under level 20 yields no points at all. Never has, probably never will.<br><br>It says on the point system rules that the VICTIM must be over level 20 to get points, but it says nothing about whether the killer needs to be over level 20. If I am level 19 can I kill folks over 20 and gain points with no risk of giving them points if I lose? <br><br>- Elaenya of SZ ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, it's all about the level of the person killed. A level 19 that kills a level 20 will indeed gain points and be able to collect an insignia. <br><br>Keep in mind, we may change all this again&#8230; We're still keeping the records and just adjusting the point values for actions. You all know that we're not going to award toasting folks much lower level than you are, so if you're worried about points, try to avoid it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000260.html"><b>Fan Faire</b></a><br>Here's the announcement. <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Verant has joined with Ubisoft, our European distributor, to bring you the first Fan Faire to take place outside if the United States!

After the unsuspecting person types this in, the scammer quickly does a "/t" so that they get the password as an away message.

A few updates were made this afternoon by Alan VanCouvering on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html"><b>Roleplaying Server</b></a><br>Majelix wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I realize you are busy with SoL, and the "RP server" hasn't gotten much more than beyond the discussion table at Verant, but I'd like to ask, will the race/class restrictions be removed for the rp server? <br><br>IE, it would be fun to play a halfling paladin or a drunken ogre bard. Of course, this presents the problem of the odd combinations becoming common, which is exactly why you disallow them on normal servers. <br><br>Rather than race/class restrictions, perhaps you could have diety/class restrictions? IE, since iksars -have- worship CT, they can not be paladins. ]</i></font><br><br>It seems unlikely that we'll change any of the class/race combinations for this server. There is no roleplaying need to do so, and there are no balance or gameplay issues that would be created by this server ruleset (unlike Sullon Zek) that would require such changes. <br><br>No doubt someone could come up with a reason for a halfling to be a paladin, or an ogre to be a bard. But the race/class combinations are set up as they are to represent the way things are in Norrath. <br><br>And if there is some concern that there would be a disproportionately large number of halfling paladins in Norrath on a regular server (though I've never heard anyone voice a concern over it&#8230;), then the same would apply on a roleplaying server.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000257.html"><b>Sullon Zek Point System</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>When you say you will lose 5 points per level if the victim is 6 or more levels lower, is that on top of the base points per kill? IE, a level 30 kills a level 24... will they get 95 points, or -5 points? <br><br>Sugarplum ]</i></font><br><br>A level 30 killing a level 24 (for the first time in over an hour) would get 100 points, less 5 points for each level lower because the victim was more than 5 levels lower than the killer.<br><br><br>So it would be 100 &#8211; [5*(30-24)] = 70 points. <br><br>Whereas if the victim were one level higher, 25th, the killer would get 100 &#8211; [2*(30-25)] = 90 points. <br><br>The idea here is to reduce the value of killing folks that don&#8217;t /con as even to you. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: QUOTE: <br><br>"Look for a News section on the Sullon board for more info in the near future. <br><br>Hobart" <br><br>Where is this 'Sullen Board' could we get a link? ]</i></font><br><br>I think I listed the link earlier in the thread, but here it is again. <br><br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp</a><br><br>There isn't a news section up there yet, though.

It seems that someone has already updated the rules. They're on the ball, that's for sure. <br><br>Grumples wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think there may be an error in the SZ point calculation. <br><br>According to the updated points rules, we still get 100+2x(level difference) for even con kills. <br><br>Yesturday I killed two even cons and did not die. I got 225 points. <br><br>For me to get 112.5 points per kill, they would have had to have been:<br>100+2Z = 112.5<br>Z = 6.25 levels over me. ]</i></font><br><br>Let's look at that again. <br><br>You didn't give your level, and it might matter, but killing someone 5 levels higher than you would produce 110 points. Two of them would produce 220 points. This leaves 5 points unexplained until you remember that insignia also give you points. I'm not sure how you would get exactly 5 points from them in this fashion.

A player with a 60th level character will be able to tell that the person that ambushed him is casting spells or doing damage that does not match with a character over 30th level or so.

In any case, 0 would never be the lower limit. A penalty is required to reduce the desire for folks to blow up those that are just way low level.

I received this report from Viergang of the 7th Hammer server:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail!<br><br>A GM event took place very recently on the 7th Hammer server. Pokkah and Scatters (a<br>couple scarecrows) attacked the grounds surrounding Kelethin, wishing death<br>to the druids. They complained about being mistreated in the fields, and<br>essentially blamed the druids. Now, as a druid of Karana I think this is<br>strange. The only scarecrows I'm aware of are on the Western Plains of<br>Karana, and the druids there are human druids (who assumedly worship<br>Karana)...why did Pokkah and Scatters attack Kelethin? Wouldn't their grudge<br>have been against Surefall?<br><br>Ruala told me:   'pokkah wished revenge for the inoppropriate use of<br>scarecrows.  He blamed the druids and sought to destroy them'<br><br>I think clues (if there are any) would be best searched for in the Western<br>Karanas, or perhaps in Rivervale (Shakey the Scarecrow is at the druid's<br>guild).<br><br>Enclosed is a picture of the foul creature's corpse, for the amusement of<br>your readers everywhere.<br><br>As an addendum, might I add that several cowards offered to throw in with<br>these scarecrows, the most vocal being a high elf male by the name of<br>Naveed. Several others were Weehealer, Beklar and Kandace. Druids meeting<br>these wretches on the 7th Hammer should think twice about assisting them, as<br>they were calling for our death only tonight!<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Viergang Von Sicherfalle<br>Druid of the 29th Season,<br>Wardens of the Wood<br>7th Hammer<br><br><br><br>Some sample Text:<br><br>Pokkah shouts, 'come haters of druids!
