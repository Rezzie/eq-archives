Here's what Alan wrote on the Developer's Corner today in response to the feedback generated by players:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar and Religion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Since the discussion of the definition of 'agnostic' in relation to Norrath has come up, I thought I might as well through in my 2 copper pieces. I think 'agnostic' in a Norrathing sense means 'not choosing to worship a god over the others', it is basically impossible to deny or even be unsure of the existence of gods in Norrath, so being agnostic would be the equivalent of 'sitting on the fence' of worhsip. That is, an agnostic character might pray to Tunare when hoping for a good harvest, Rodcet Nife when a family member or friend is sick, or Rallos Zek when his/her people are going to war, etc etc. Personally I think that the vast majority of Norrath would be agnostic (in that sense), but thats just me, prejudiced by my encounters with fantasy and historic religion. Excuse the ramblings. ;o) <br><br>-Mistyn<br>Virtuoso of Luclin ]</i></font><br><br>Rambling is a good thing. :)<br><br>That's as good a definition of agnostic in Norrath as any. The point I wanted to make was that it doesn't (can't) mean the same thing in Norrath that it does for us. And getting hung up on the real life meaning of the word isn't really necessary, and it's not useful to your roleplaying experience. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor,<br>But...what if the world didn't have to change at all? I mean, I believe what the person was intending on doing was EARNING the right to become a bard. By this he wasn't saying throw new guild leaders in each and every single city (I'm not sure if this what you were leaning towards or away from), but instead imagine his DE hunting orcs until 15 so he could at least get into FP to try and prove his worthiness to the guild leader. It's an excellent idea...what if you were to throw a NPC that you could turn your PVP book into (Tomb of Order and Discord) that would grant you the option of becoming an outcast from your city? Think about it...your a High Elf that would love nothing more than to be able to sneak around and steal. You turn your book in to the new NPC and he/she says "You wish to follow your own trail then 'eh? Very well Absor...may Tunare have mercy on your soul...". The NPC kills you, and you respawn outside the city gates. When you try to move near the city guards, their weapons are pointed towards you now...you're an outcast and not wanted here anymore. Get the idea? I'm not quite sure how much coding it would take, or even if it's possible...but I figured it was worth a shot. <br><br>-Tang- ]</i></font><br><br>I understand the idea. And it sounds like a nice one. But it forgets one thing. <br><br>Give people the chance to become a dark elven ranger, and a large portion of the player base will do just that. How much sense would it make if 20% of the dark elven people were rangers? 20% of Norrath's nastiest people are tree-huggers? <br><br>This sort of dovetails into this next comment. It's LONG. I kind of regret my policy of not editing peoples comments&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor: <br><br>I know this is a long post, but I RILLY RILLY hope you'll read it. This is something that's very important to me and something about which I feel very strongly. <br><br>About the subject of removing racial class restrictions, you said: <br><br>"The difference between your idea of no holds barred <br>roleplaying and what I feel is roleplaying are very <br>strong. "<br><br>Oh dear. I can tell I'm not going to like the rest of your post. <br><br>Ruatha reads the rest of your post <br><br>Yep, I was right. I didn't like it. <br>*sigh* <br><br>It's always frustrating to me to try and discuss this topic because it's just so obvious to me how much more fun the game would be if there were less (or no) class restrictions based on race. This isn't to say that I'm right and you're wrong and neener neener neener if you don't like it. Not at all. The rational, reasonable part of my brane tells me "Now now, Ru, not everybody sees the world the way you see the world. And remember: reasonable people with good intentions can still disagree on important issues." And I understand that this is an issue where there really isn't a "wrong" answer. <br><br>But... <br><br>On some level, it's just so blindingly obvious to me -- so fundamentally self evident -- that the game could and would be so much more fun with fewer racial class restrictions (or no racial class restrictions at all), that I have a hard time explaining it. It's like if someone said "Why shouldn't I burn off this dog's tail with a blowtorch?" I wouldn't be able to explain logically and rationally why they shouldn't do it. All I'd be able to do would be to splutter and say "Well, it's just *WRONG* to do that!" <br><br>So there's this other part of my brane -- the old lizard hindbrane bits -- that makes me just wanna grab people who advocate restrictive class options due to "fiction" and shake them briskly and yell "WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!? WHY CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH MORE *FUN* THE GAME WOULD BE IF I COULD BE AN OGRE BARD OR AN ERUDITE WARRIOR?!?" <br><br>(Actually, since I'm a gnome, I'd probably grab them and just shake myself back and forth briskly while they remained motionless. Ah, the perils of being the proper size while surrounded by all you giants... [biggrin]) <br><br>Having said all of that, I'll try to explain why I feel the way I feel... <br><br>Like many (perhaps most) of the people who play EQ, I have an extensive background in reading Science Fiction and Fantasy books. I grew up reading authors like Asimov and Heinlein. As I got older, I started reading more fantasy and less SF. These days, I'm much more likely to read some cheesy Forgotten Realms book than I am to read Science Fiction. What can I say? I just like the swords and sorcery Fantasy setting. <br><br>But the characters that have always held the most interest for me were those characters that were "different." Characters that didn't adhere to standard Sword-n-Sorcery conventions. I think the first character like this I ever ran across was Elric, from the Moorcock books. <br><br>Elric was the antithesis of the typical sword-n-sorcery hero, particularly of heroes like Conan and Fahfrd. The typical Sword-n-Sorcery hero was big, strong, and physically powerful. They were often uncivilized (both Conan and Fahfrd were barbarians). They had no little (if any) tolerance for the arcane arts. And they were very clearly Good Guys(tm). <br><br>Elric was physically frail, to the point where, before he got Stormbringer, he required drugs to survive. He embraced civilization and longed for its trappings when he was away. He used Sorcery to further his own goals. And he was not always a Good Guy(tm). <br><br>And not only was Elric a departure from scores of fantasy heroes which preceded him, but he was also a rebel among his own kind. He disliked the decadence into which his own race had fallen, and was responsible for leading the sacking of his own hometown. This (among other things) is how he earned the nickname "Kinslayer." <br><br>But Elric was just the first. He's been followed by a string of other characters, heroes and anti-heroes (and occasionally villains) who were interesting because they didn't fit into pre-existing notions of how they should behave. Probably the most well-known of these characters are Drizzt Do'Urden, the Dark Elf Ranger from the R.A. Salvatore books and Dragonbait, the Lizardman Paladin from the "Azure Bonds" books by Jeff Grubb. And there are dozens of others. <br><br>And I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only one who finds these characters much more interesting than their mundane counterparts. Any Human can be a Ranger. But a *Dark Elf*? Why would a Dark Elf be a Ranger? Why isn't he Evil like the rest of his kind? What drove him away from the underground and towards the light? Where did he learn his Ranger skills? The story behind these questions is much more interesting (to me, and to lots of other people) than the story behind why J. Random Human became a Ranger. <br><br>This interest in non-standard, convention-breaking characters has followed me all through my RPG career (spanning over 20 years now). I have always played a non-standard character in all of my RPGs. I was the player who was always pestering the GM to let me bend (or break) the racial class restrictions a tad so I could play something fun and unique. My favorite AD&D character was an Orc Warrior that my GM allowed me to run. <br><br>Even within EverQuest, I have always played non-standard characters. The reason I picked a Gnome Warrior is because they're different. I also have an Ogre Warrior who was raised by Erudites. He wears glasses, and speaks with a cultured, sophisticated accent -- right up until he goes Berzerk, at which point he degenerates into traditional Ogrespeak and starts yelling "THROG SMASH! THROG KILL! GRAAAR!" (He keeps talking like this until the Berzerk wears off, at which point he apologizes to his group and becomes painfully embarassed about his behavior.) I once started a Human Wizard and dumped 15 points into STR and 15 points into STA and claimed that his mother was a Barbarian, and he'd inherited his physical (and mental) traits from his mother's side. But his father had been a Wizard. And his grandfather had been a Wizard. And his great-grandfather had been a Wizard. So he was determined to be a Wizard as well, even though he was much more suited to the life of a Melee class. <br><br>And so on, and so forth, etc. I have always had an interest in playing non-standard characters, because standard characters are...well...standard. And to me, "standard" equals "boring." <br><br>To this, you say: <br><br>"Roleplaying requires a setting. You can't roleplay <br>characters without a universe for them to exist in. <br>Characters, therefore, should be a logical outcome of <br>living in that world (and of course that world needs <br>to make sense). Iksar paladins don't fit into the world <br>of Norrath. Iksar have been isolated for a very long <br>time. They have only one god, and he certainly doesn't <br>support the idea of paladins. That is a function of the <br>nature of iksar, as they exist on Norrath. It's part of <br>the world. Creating a character that is explicitly <br>contrary to that world isn't roleplaying. "<br><br>Allow me to point out two things. <br><br>1) Verant defines the fiction. If Verant had created the Iksar race and said "There is a heretical sect of good-aligned Iksars hidden within a secret camp in the Field of Bone. Iksars who follow this sect can be Paladins." then *voila*, that's the fiction. That's what they did with Erudites. Erudites are noble and good -- except for those Heretics in Paineel. So you can't really justify your argument with "Well, that's not fiction." You work for the company that creates the fiction, and they can define any fiction they choose if it suits their needs. <br><br>2) Having said that, yes, I agree that setting is important. And, for better or for worse, Verant has set the initial fiction in stone. Iksars can't start off as Paladins. Ogres can't start off as Bards. Erudites can't start off as Warriors. And I agree that it would be kinda silly to have completely unrestricted race/class combinations at character creation. I mean, I just can't see an Ogre Paladin guild in Oggok. <br><br>But. <br><br>People (and Iksars, and Ogres, and Erudites) can change, if they want. Who's to say that an Ogre Warrior, travelling outside of Oggok for the first time, might not run across a bard in the Feerrott, and be entranced by the songs of the bard, to the point where he becomes determined to be a bard himself? Who's to say that an Erudite, after visiting Qeynos for the first time, becomes filled with visions of martial glory after visiting the Grounds of Fate, and becomes determined to be a Warrior? <br><br>So for me, I'm not irked by the fact that my beginning class selection is racially restricted. But I do think there should be a way to change to a different class via a quest. <br><br>Before you start shaking your head and saying "No no no, out of the question," hear me out. I have what I think is a perfectly workable (in the sense of "won't unbalance the game and won't break fiction") idea to allow in-game class changes. <br><br>1) For every class in the game, create at least one avenue where anyone of any race/class/deity combo raise faction with a guild of that class. It doesn't necessarily have to be an exciting or easy way to raise faction. Maybe it's tedious and boring. And make it so where it doesn't raise faction with anybody else but the guild in question. <br><br>2) Create an NPC that gives out a "change of class" quest for that guild. The quest should be challenging on the order of the Crafted Armor quests. <br><br>2a) Make it so where you can't switch classes if your race could have been that class from the beginning. So if you're a human, you can't switch to any class but Shaman (since humans can be every other class). <br><br>3) Require the player character to be at least 20th level and have "Ally" level faction before the NPC gives out the "change of class" quest. <br><br>4) Once the character completes the quest, the character undergoes a ceremony which transforms him/her into a 1st level character of the desired class -- with the same stats as a 1st level character of the desired class. All those weapon skills you've been raising for 20 levels? Reset to zero. All those other skills you've been learning for 20 levels, like Bind Wound and Baking? Reset to zero. All those hit points you had as a 20th level character? Gone. You're a 1st Level character with the same HP as any 1st level character would have based on your class and STA. You may have been a 20th level Ogre SK with 1000 hp before, but now you're a 1st level Ogre Enchanter with 30 HP. All the equipment you had on you? Gone. You're now the proud owner of 5 biscuits, 5 flasks of milk, and the standard Newbie weapon for your class. (Sure, this could be bypassed with the help of a friend. But then it's just like twinking, and that's pretty common in the game. So you're not really making the situation worse.) <br><br>4a) The character's deity is also changed if the new class is incompatible with the character's original deity. The new class/deity combination will not improve faction with anyone. Everybody who disliked you before still dislikes you. But faction can get worse, depending on the nature of the deity change. <br><br>5) This is a one-time only quest. Once you've changed your class, you can't change it back, or change to another class. (Word gets around that you've changed your class once, and other guild leaders will refuse to accept you on the assumption that you're a dilettante.) <br><br>So, to illustrate an example: <br><br>Throckmorton the Troll wants to be a Ranger. To become a Ranger, Throckmorton has to first find a way to increase faction with one of the Ranger guilds in the game (Kithicor Rangers, Protectors of the Pine, or Champions of Faydark) until he is considered an "Ally" of this guild. Note that being an Ally with one of these guilds doesn't necessarily convey the automatic ability to wander nonchalantly up to the guild trainers. For example, if Throckmorton raises his Protectors of the Pine faction without raising his JaggedPine Treefolk faction, then his trip to see Hager Sureshot in Surefall Glade will end the minute he runs across one of the druids in Surefall. <br><br>Once he has found a way to increase faction to Ally, and found a way to approach the "change-of-class" quest NPC without getting killed, he then has to wait until he's 20th level before he can even do the quest. Once he hits 20th level, he's given a quest along the lines of "Go get a common drop from a rare MOB and bring it back." Once he completes this quest, he is transformed into a 1st level character of the new class. He has the original STR, STA, DEX, etc stats that he started with initially, but all his combat skills are reset to zero and his HP is calculated based on his new class and current Level and STA. So before the change, he was a 20th level Warrior with several hundred HP. Now he's a 1st level Ranger with 30 HP. <br><br>Since he can't be a Ranger and worship Cazic-Thule, he also had to switch deities. So he picked Karana. Alas, the only people who've heard about his conversion are the people in Neriak, Grobb, and Oggok. So anybody he was KOS to before, he's still KOS to now. Plus he's now KOS in places he used to not be KOS in. <br><br>The reason I think this will work is because: <br><br>1) It won't be a cakewalk. Being allied with the Bard Guild in Qeynos doesn't mean a thing if you're KOS to the Qeynos Guards and the Qeynos Merchants. So if you're an Ogre who wants to be a Bard, you'll either have to find some way to sneak in to the Bard Guild without being seen by any of the merchants or guards, or you'll have to raise faction with the Qeynos Guards and Merchants as well. <br><br>2) It's not easy to abuse. Requiring that someone be Allied faction *and* 20th level before even being given the *quest* to change class will keep a lot of folks from doing it, because they won't want to go through all the tedium of raising faction for 20 levels, only to get to start all over at level 1 and go back through the first 20 levels again. <br><br>3) It's not unbalancing. Your faction won't be any better after the class change than it was before. However, it might very well be worse. And being an weak Erudite Warrior or a dumb Troll Enchanter will confer its own challenges. <br><br>4) It's consistent with existing fiction. Yes, in the world of Norrath, most Ogres are mindless brutes who eat dwarves and beat each other with swords just for funsies. So no Ogre can *start* as a Bard. That's just not part of the Ogre culture on Norrath. But if an Ogre goes adventuring, meets a Bard, and decides that he RILLY RILLY RILLY wants to *be* a Bard, he can, if he's willing to pay his dues. <br><br>5) It encourages creativity and roleplaying. People will be encouraged to come up with reasons for why their Gnome is a Shadow Knight, or that their Ogre is an Enchanter, and this is a good thing. And, for the most part, I think that the majority of the people who would even bother doing this will be those people who are inclined towards roleplaying anyways. <br><br>Now, obviously, this may not necessarily be an easy coding job. But from a gameplay, game balance, and game fiction standpoint, I think it makes a whole lot of sense. I can't think of any negatives that would occur from a system like this. <br><br>Wow. Like I said, this was a long post. I hope you read it, and I hope it makes sense. I cannot express how much I would [b]***LOVE*** to play on a server that had a mechanism like I describe for changing classes. I play on Brell. I've been playing on Brell since August 1999. I love my guild, and I love my guildmates. And I would leave them all in a heartbeat to play on a server that would allow me to be an Ogre Bard or an Erudite Warrior. (Actually, I wouldn't really be leaving them. I know 'em well enough that they'd be racing me to the new server so they could play a neat new character.) So I'm asking you to please please PLEASE look this over and don't reject it out of hand just because you don't personally agree with it. Even if this isn't something you would want to implement on all the servers, I think it's something you could easily implement one one server. So those of us who wanted to be unique characters could do so, while those of you who think it "breaks fiction" wouldn't have to play on that server and wouldn't have to be confronted with High Elf Monks and Dwarf Magicians. <br><br>Thanks a lot for your time! <br><br>Ruatha Kneeslasher<br>48th Level Gnome Warriorette <br>Skyfire is what Lavastorm wants to be when it grows up... ]</i></font><br><br>My response to you is the same that it was to the last person. In a world with no restrictions, you can't be an iconoclast. <br><br>I love to play the outcast. I love having some sort of stigma attached to my characters. In a recent D&D campaign we were to play members of a once-great society that had fallen to a plague. They now find themselves surrounded by wild lands. Into those wild lands they toss their criminals, and those criminals are often bitter.<br> <br>When handed the character creation information, I read that we could play outcasts if we chose to. The risks would be incredible (poorly treated by the bulk of the civilized people of the world, poorly treated by your own folk, no chance of resurrection in a world where raising the dead is not uncommon and many more). The GM stressed this several times in the written material and in person. I know my fellow players, we've been playing together for years. I knew that at most three of us would choose to be outcasts. It turns out only two of us did (the other went to the other extreme, hating outcasts to with a passion). <br><br>I wouldn't have chosen to be an outcast if it wouldn't have been a hard character to play, and I certainly wouldn't have done it if I thought that the majority of the group would have done it. <br><br>But that's a small group, and a group that knows that when our GM says "playing an outcast is going to be HARD", he means it. <br><br>When you're talking about thousands of players, a large number of which are fans of the same fantasy authors that we're all fans of, you'll find that a large number of players will want to play the outcast. They either won't believe that it will be hard to do, or they'll expect things to be made easier if they complain enough. <br><br>That's why I love the new rules for Sullon Zek. You can play the iconoclast, the outsider, and there are real in-game consequences for that choice. <br><br>Without those consequences (making it hard to accomplish won't be a consequence, once you've done that, then things will be smooth sailing) you're unique Drizzt will be one of many Drizzts, and he won't be nearly as much fun. And he certainly won't be the unique character that he is in the world of his creator. In a novel the character can remain unique. Make him an option in a massively multiplayer game and he will become too common. <br><br>That's my opinion, anyhow. <br><br>Runti wrote: <br><br>Absor, <br><br>I have to agree with your recent comments about the players needing to fit into the world of Norath. For most roleplayers, the most fun comes from playing a character who is different from the norm. Thus the desire for dark elf bards and iksar paladins. The problem is that most roleplayers are used to worlds with 4 to 8 PCs and millions of NPCs. Norath has more PCs than player race NPCs. If too many people are "different" the races lose any sense of culture. Better to be restricted to a strong well thought out story than to wander through a muddle of incongruities. ]</i></font><br><br>/em nods.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>Sullon Zek</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hey Absor/whoever reads this...will you the development team notify us the players when something gets changed/fixed on Sullon during this testing phase (ex: you allow Rogues to Pickpocket and you post this change on the developers forum) or will (when it comes into effect) you simply have Ester broadcast it once and let those 400 or so people that are on at that instant be the only ones to know?

When the guild was at the height of its power, we boasted forty members, many of whom were avid roleplayers. We stood opposed to dark guilds and had wars and battles all across Norrath.

It was a quiet day on the Developer's Corner.  The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000216.html">big update</a> from Mr. Poe by way of Alan:<UL>Lawrence sent me this update to pass on to all of you. <br><br>----------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Hey guys, as I get ready to head out for the Fan Faire I wanted to sit down and write up this post I've been putting off all week. A couple quick notes. <br><br>The "problem" with rain spell pulses always being resisted if they will be the killing blow isn't actually a problem....It's an intentional design feature. The problem was much like the old DOT corpse poof buf. If the Rain killed the NPC and the server was unsure where the damage came from the corpse would poof, so these spells were coded in this manner to prevent that from happening. I'm working with the coders to come up with a better solution. We're all pretty busy right now so unfortunately I can't give you a time frame on when a better solution will be implemented. <br><br>Kunark Evac spells: these will now work anywhere in the world. You won't have to be in a Kunark dungeon to use them. This change will apply to both Wizards and Druids evac spells. <br><br>Druid Spell Egress: this spell will now work indoors. It didn't make sense for the group version to work indoors (a mistake on our part) and not have the self version work indoors. <br><br>Shroud of Death: I added Illusion Skeleton to shroud of death on test server..... I removed it the next day I just didn't get to update spells on test. I forgot that in skeleton form trolls and ogres would lose slam, sorry for the scare. I'll see if I can think up some other way to give SKs skeleton form. <br><br>Stacking issues: I continue to address these as time permits. We're working on some changes that will allow me to fix them much easier. More stacking issues should be resolved in the coming months. High level players should be pleased to know that I'm 99.99999% certain that Call of Earth and Speed of the Shissar will no longer conflict after the next patch. <br><br>New Translocates: as many of you know there are new translocate spells up on test. I'm not going to comment on these other than to say you can expect that cool cat Al'Kabor to be out and about researching again. <br><br>Now on to the "Burning issue". I know the Wizard community has been *patiently* awaiting the enhancement we have been working on The coding for the new spell effect has been finished and it is going through extensive internal testing. It has also been on Test Server for a week, but I doubt you would have seen it in a parser &#8211; cause I'm sneaky like that. Before I go into details on the new spells there's a few things I'd like to say. Honestly I feel that wizards are balanced fine from a power standpoint, to that end you will not be receiving an upgrade to your damage output. Where I do feel wizards need help is group utility. <br><br>As I'm sure you can understand coming up with a highly desirable utility type spell for an EverQuest wizard is not an easy task. I've spent countless hours pondering a solution, I've read countless message board forums and emails looking at suggestions from you guys. Finally a solution was found! I'm not naive enough to believe that everyone will be happy about the new enhancement but this is an idea I've seen tossed around on a number of forums and I think not only does it fit in well with wizards being the masters of arcane transportation, I think it will make them very desirable in the 50 to 60 levels where they seem to be struggling for usefulness. <br><br>The new spells will give wizards the ability to prevent NPCs from gating. There will be 3 versions of the spells starting at level 51. They will each have a different resistance type. One of the problems with duration based effects is stacking and negating the need for multiple characters of the same class. I am designing these spells with that in mind. If you want to 100% ensure an NPC does not gate you will need more than one wizard. I understand this may upset some people but the need for multiple wizards to "Anchor" an NPC won't really happen until you fight the more epic mobs with higher hit point numbers. For single group encounters one wizard with these spells should, in most situations, be enough to get the job done. My plan is to get these spells implemented and ready to go before the next patch. <br><br>Lastly I would like to send a huge thank you to all the players who have reported stacking exploits to me through Email, IRC, and ICQ over the past couple of months. The feedback is greatly appreciated. <br><br>Take care all!<br>/Lakers secret handshake<br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>----------------------------------------<br>:)<br><br>Alan</UL>

A search for a missing Paladin has begun.  Here's the word from Aragir Lancot:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings all.I was once a member of Ring of Truth, on Xegony server. Jareth Wolfeshadow was the guildleader at the time,a paladin of 30 some levels. Before I left the guild he and I had become fast friends. We had even discussedthe possibility of his coming to visit me and my wife IRL. He changed his surname to D'Lere in the months afterI left Ring of Truth, and levelled up to about 40 some odd by January.<br><br>Jareth was an upstanding paladin; truth, honor, and valor were qualities that described him above many others.In February I met with him and he bestowed upon me his Ghoulbane, which I wield to this day.On Saturday, June 9, I heard from a friend, who'd heard from a friend that claimed to have heard from Jareth'splayers RL brother, that Jareth had perished in a car accident. However, I have spoke to the friend, and to thisfriend's friend, and the details are sketchy. I am, if not unconvinced, unsatisfied with the information I've recievedso far.<br><br>Anyone who may have known the player behind Jareth D'lere, please contact me at <a href="mailto:hbooraem@excite.com">hbooraem@excite.com</a> withwhatever contact information you can offer me. I know several details about the players life, such that I amconfident I can screen the uninformed from those who actually have genuine information.Thank you for your help. If Jareth D'Lere has truly passed away, Norrath has suffered the loss of a true paladin,and the world has lost a good man.

Users can pick and choose which items they wish to display and which items they do not wish to display, so you still may post your status and remain anonymous if you wish.<br> <br>Some may think this will cause lag since it is pasring the log file intermitantly, however, the way I designed it, it makes no lag at all (I even tested it on a machine running a Pentium II 300Mhz with 96Mb ram on a 56K and it ran fine while in EQ).  When parsing, it will parse ONLY new lines in your log file, so it doesnt create any lag.<br> <br>Okay, so you have to have the log option on for this to pull the information, what if you dont want to have a log file building up? There is an option included to erase already parsed information.<br> <br>Also, be sure to keep an eye out for the release of the listing server.  In later versions I will allow other websites to run a listing server of their own.  Perfect for guilds!<br> <br> <br>Download available at <a href="http://www.eqguardians.com/download">http://www.eqguardians.com/download</a><br> <br>Happy Questing!<br>Golggen Tru`Light - Xegony<br>Webmaster - EQGuardians.com</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Alan dropped by the Developer's Corner this afternoon and made a variety of updates.  Here they are for your reading pleasure:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000199.html"><b>nVidia Drivers</b></a><br>CloudKraken wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Actually, on the Win2k driver inf file, the registry setting for TNT is there, but the TNT's Enumeration ID isn't there. <br><br>Result is Windows cannot find any matching Enum ID for TNT in the inf file and think the driver kit does not contain any files for TNT. <br><br>So unless you edit the .inf yourself and void the WHQC stamp, you can't really install the driver through standard methods. <br><br>So the 54 year-old man was right, at least on the Win2k system.]</i></font> <br><br>Fair enough. <br><br>This isn't our driver, so I can't fix this. :)<br><br>I guess I'll have to say, use it at your own risk, we can't make it work. But it's certainly something we'd suggest you use, if you can get it to work.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000195.html"><b>More Feedback!</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've made a few posts about the possible future of all the Iksar class quests and if they will be brought to ;ogical completion, but have never recieved any kind of response. I thought this would fall under the category of new topics, but i guess not. If this subject has already been addressed I was wondering if you could repost your comments about it. I haven't been able to find any info on the matter. <br><br>Sorulrna Ironscale of Castersrealm<br>46th lvl monk of Karana ]</i></font><br><br>All of the Iksar quests are technically finished. All the ones that exist can be completed. Only the Greenmist quest even implies that there is a chance that the quest might be extended. <br><br>That being said, there are plans to extend some of these quests at some time in the future. I don't know when that will be. <br><br>Dedaelos wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The trumpet fanfare you hear when completing a quest was also used in an older rpg called Daggerfall. You would hear the same sound when you did certain things like gaining levels, if I remember correctly. ]</i></font><br><br>Sound travels&#8230; <br><br>:)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: That trumpet thingy is more like the first few tones from the title screen of the second BlackAdder series ... <br><br>At first I was stupified why I kept hearing that in my head while playing Everquest, until I finished a quest once with that tune playing in my head ... then one and one connected. <br><br>Heh, so now whenever I finish a quest, I automatically hum that tune a little while. Kinda weird how BlackAdder and Everquest connect, eh? Well, I've seen things more weird :)<br><br>- Kaysha Soulsinger<br>Cleric of the 47th Circle of Erollisi Marr ]</i></font><br><br>Very far indeed&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just one little thing I have given some thought to in the past. In a way its modeled after the change that came to the xp bar. The smaller line down the middle of the xp bar that represented the percentage of a yellow bubble. <br><br>I have wondered for some time if it would be possible to do something similar on the group list. However in this case the line drawn down the middle of each players health status bar would represent how much mana that person currently has. Now I know this would add to the amount of information be sent out to the clients, but I always thought it would be an interesting addition. <br><br>cheers, <br><br>Keyen of the Crimson Hawks. ]</i></font><br><br>We don't have any plans to implement something like that. There really is no way that your character would know that status of your friends' magical energy. You can look at them and get an idea as to how wounded they are, but knowing their mana isn't something that we see as part of the game. I know there have been a lot of requests for this feature and others this it (one that asked for a %M that would report your percentage mana for macros). But we just don't see that as part of the game. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Is verant an equal oportunity employer? I know you have a gnoll (FIPPP!) a halfling (Mennix) and atleast atleast 2 dorfs (Lead GM's Axegoreth and Valtron) but does verant employee any half elves? <br><br>I'm starting to wonder if my people are being discriminated against! <br><br>We are without a doubt the cutest race. <br><br>Galidin the Noble Heart<br>Half Elf Crusader ]</i></font><br><br>Perhaps the cutest race indeed. But as is evidenced by my employment here, cute isn't a consideration&#8230; <br><br>:)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000019.html"><b>Roleplaying or Just Playing?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As an alternative to removing Common or making Dark Speech act as "Dark Common," why not simply make Common a language that players have to learn? It makes sense that someone raised in Kaladim might have heard some Common, but it's unlikely that they actually learned the language until they had a reason to go out into the world. <br><br>This makes sense in the context of a trade tongue. Even though you might deal with dwarven merchants on a regular basis, if you're dwarven the odds are slim that you bothered to learn a new language when your native one works just fine. <br><br>Alternatively, you could default common to start at only 1-2 points, perhaps representing the few bits of the language picked up by observing the local dwarven merchant purchasing leather gloves from the human ranger . . . <br><br>--Ixsamael ]</i></font><br><br>That's another possibility. We haven't really talked about how hard we want to make it to communicate on a roleplaying server. Making it hard to speak with folks outside your race serves to insulate the racial community, making them tighter knit and making it less likely (because it's harder) that someone will break down the racial stereotypes. <br><br>But it also makes the game harder to play, especially if taken too far. It could be argued that removing /tell is the right thing to do on a roleplaying server, simply because it isn't something that your character should be able to do. But it is also an extremely useful tool for the player. <br><br>And that gave me an idea&#8230; what about only allowing /tell to work for a character over X level? We might be willing to accept that all Norrathians have some ability to communicate mentally as they grow more powerful (guards can tell your religion, after all&#8230;). And this would insulate the lower level communities, making it more likely that young trolls will hang out with other young trolls, and young halflings will hang out with other young halflings, if used in combination with the removal of a common language.<br> <br>But is that too restrictive to fun gameplay? I don't know. We'll hash this out internally some time in the future. But we're not really looking at implementing a roleplaying server right away. We want to keep focused on the new PvP thing for a while, until we're satisfied with it. So keep hold of your ideas. I'll be asking for them later. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I know this involves programming, but what the heck. As long we're brainstorming about Common and emotes, why not simply have a "language check" for emotes? When a character performs an emote, either one of the defaults or by typing, the emote is flagged with that language. When someone sees the emote, it must be deciphered just like any other language text. <br><br>I would really hate to see emotes removed from a Roleplaying server -- it seems like it would defeat the whole purpose. On that server I would hope to see more use of emotes rather than less. A language check could easily be justified as an understanding of the culture and I think would add to the fun of playing on the server. <br><br>Oh, and by the way, I really think this would have to work for all emotes because I rarely use the built-in ones. I'm a good typist and can easily throw in a quick sentence about my character's behavior that fits the situation. A new feature that I would like to see is the separation of the physical actions from the text. Take /wave for instance. There are times when I'd like to do something like the following: <br><br>/em looks at %T impatiently.<br>/wave <br><br>In other words, I'd like to have the waving animation without the "Arshal waves at soandso" message. Maybe you could modify the command so that if additional text is provided it is used instead of the default. Eg: <br><br>/wave looks at %T impatiently. <br><br>Whadayathink? <br><br>Arshal ]</i></font><br><br>That's most certainly a way to go. Maybe even restrict emotes to the character's native tongue (which might be easier to program). <br><br>I can see the value of your suggestion about text attached to emotes. I'll pass that on. As you can imagine it isn't the sort of thing that we're going to drop other things to look into, but it's certainly worth taking a look at. <br><br>Mechromancer wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well,for me (and I know I am in the minority here) I don't enjoy roleplaying in any game where the game mechanics themselves don't provide incentive for roleplaying(such as the "advantages" and "Disadvantages" of such "generic" systems as HERO and GURPS).I cannot help this.I have been a "systems freak" since I discovered "RuneQuest" and other great p&p RPG's and stopped playing simpler games like "(A)D&D".I would have no problem with roleplaying in EQ if I could choose a "disadvantage" like "Hates gnomes"(any gnomes conning me would get the "Scowls at you..." message ...that would be cool) or "weakness for beautiful women"(you can imagine a troll with this disad' having a small chance of becoming "charmed" or "mezzed" when within agro radius of a non-hostile high charisma elf maiden...that would be hilarious!).]</i></font> <br><br>I'm the other way around. Systems like Gurps and Hero System that encourage players to make up really bizarre character traits just to get points tend to bother me (love those systems, just not keen on that one part). And I think that RuneQuest rocks because it is a simpler system than D&D (though 3rd edition goes a long way toward removing the needless complications of that system). The RuneQuest world is exceedingly complex and detailed, but the game system itself is one of the simplest I've ever seen. <br><br>The reason that I'm not a big fan of the idea of rewarding personality quirks with points is that, well, you should be adding those quirks to your character anyway. If your character hates Gnomes, then he hates Gnomes. Getting points for it doesn't make that quirk more valid. It's more the opposite, really. You tend to see far more completely ridiculous quirks in a system that rewards the player with points for them. <br><br>My old gaming group (/em Absor lapses into his old EQX editorial style) is restarting our 'planar' campaign. The idea was to allow us to make the wildest characters possible. We would make up the world they came from, with as much detail as we wanted. We'd also be building characters with the express intent of making them as powerful as we can, because the game campaign is going to be really hard. Then the characters would be yanked to Sigil (the D&D 'center of the universe' setting). <br><br>Well, in mild mockery of this idea, I created a superhero character. Once able to fly, call the lightning and rip cars in half, he had been reduced to mortal status by the trickery of an old flame. He was glad to escape his old world for the new one, where he studies magic. <br><br>But I gave him a few quirks, as much to make fun of the whole idea as to get him points. His spells don't affect things that are the color yellow. This makes a lot of things resistant to his spells, and someone could easily kill him with a #2 pencil if they dressed themselves in a banana suit&#8230; <br><br>But I digress. I've seen Hero system characters with some of the stupidest flaws attached to them, just because they needed a few more points. <br><br>You can have quirks in EverQuest. And they are all the more meaningful because everyone knows that they are part of your character's personality, not some desire to have a few more points added to the power of your energy blast. <br><br>In fact my character on Sullon, at least until he's wiped, is learning to really, really hate necromancers&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: What I've always found funny is that standard Troll and Ogre roleplaying sound svery much like the typical parody of Canadian Prime Ministeer Jean Chrtien. <br><br>Chrtien's grasp of English isn't as strong as you might expect of a Canadian, and it wouldn't be out of place to hear him say "meez gonna eats yoos." <br><br>Very funny. I'm sure other Canadians agree. <br><br>Aethelgrin<br>DE Warrior &#8211; Karana ]</i></font><br><br>Don't get mad at me, Canada.

After a short delay due to last weekend's server problems, a new editorial has been published at Shadoe's Corner.  <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid992486237,50295,">Questing for EQ Comedy</a> explores the world of EQ humor sites as well as briefly touching on the Conquest guild controversy.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>Is it me, or does it seem like EverQuest-related comic strips have lost their focus lately? Not so much a deviation from the focus on the game itself, or any tongue-in-cheek derision on what life is like for the average EQ player, but rather on compromising basic humor for the sake of political commentary. For ages, it's been part of my morning ritual at the office to kick off the day with such levity as delivered by /GU... by Woody Hearn, Ding! by Scott Kurtz, and the late (but not forgotten) EverCrest by Tim Fries. They've been a staple in the drudgery of my workaday lifestyle, keeping me sane in my 8x8 cubicle by offering the occasional guffaw at the game's expense. </UL>You can respond to Shadoe's latest editorial by posting to the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=12609321&replies=0">Feedback Board Thread</a>.

Here's the latest load of posts written by Alan VanCouvering on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>Deity Server</b></a><br>Rubikoob wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First off, let me say I very much like the idea of the Deity-based team PvP server, and personally plan on having my 1 character there. I hope the testing goes well. <br><br>However, I have some doubts regarding the balancing of the teams. From the charts I've seen (thanks to EQLizer), the good team has 34 race/class combinations compared to 48 for the neutrals and 45 for the evils. There are 2 races which cannot be evil (Dwarves and High Elves), 3 races which cannot be neutral (Trolls, Ogres, Iksar), and 7 (!) races which cannot be good (All the short races, the pure-evils, and the Dark Elves). The good team has no one able to cast Summon Corpse (I realize, however, that it has already been said that a method will be given them), and no race which is pure-good. While it is a valid point that having a race which is purely one alignment is as much a detriment as a benefit, I believe each of the teams ought to have at least one such race, representing a sort of core or foundation. <br><br>In my opinion, this set up looks pretty well stacked against the good-aligned team. I suspect that the new, upcoming Vah Shir race may be the answer. This is probably even the intended place for that race... but I'd like to hear a comment directly from someone at Verant to confirm/deny/poke fun at this... prediction? If the Vah Shir show up, pure-good, with an average number of classes to choose from, it will bring the good team right about into balance with the others. <br><br>Thanks for your time. The work you do here on the board is very much appreciated. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, as I've said, it is entirely possible that Evil will be strongest on this server. But not so much for the reasons you've stated. <br><br>The number of race class combinations really doesn't matter. People will decide their team before they choose a race or class. The fact that there are more combinations for one or the other probably won't influence this decision. The only time it will matter is for those that prefer a class over all others. Those that want to be monks, for example, won't be able to be evil. But if they want to play a cleric, they can be on any team. The trick is that most of the classes are available to all teams. <br><br>It is, however, a much bigger issue that the evil team has more security, more unity. They will rule three cities completely, and one more almost completely. That will have a large bearing on their success as a team. <br><br>But, really, it will come down to how many players on a server will want to play on each team. If the majority of people want to play good, then good will have an advantage, regardless of the situation. <br><br>Some of the solutions that I've seen, like moving Rallos to the neutral team, or Karana to the good, won't work. That sort of change would really mess up the class availability. Making Karana good would mean there are no neutral rangers or druids, and that seems wrong on a lot of levels. Making Rallos neutral would fragment the evil teams, leaving them worse off than any other team (as opposed to better off like they are now), and it would mean no evil bards, so no tracking&#8230; <br><br>I'm real convinced that the current organization is the best available, even though it wasn't my design. :)<br><br>Sslith <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Will guilds created on Sullon during the test phase transfer over when the server goes live? ]</i></font><br><br>Nope. Sorry, it's a full wipe. <br><br>Mancubus-VZ wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well I hit the wrong button in the process of writing the last message so lets try again. Im just hoping to get a response or some notification that this bug is in fact a bug and is being looked into. When a bard has targeted a threatening PC opponent, usually for combat, the use of any group only beneficial spells cannot be used and the message, this Spell cannot effect this PC, comes up. I would assume this is a simple error, and requires a little coding, but any song a bard sings is not beneficial to your enemy. If I were to cast Selos on my group that is not beneficial to the enemy, in fact its the complete opposite. Not only is the song not affecting him directly, but now my entire group is running faster than the enemy making this spell an attack spell in essense. The only way to get beneficial group only songs to play is to tab target yourself and then tab target back to your opponent. This additional step takes a second or two and makes me as the bard lose track of what I was doing because my hands have to shift position in order to successfully attempt this maneuver. Any information or planning of fixing this bug would be greatly appreciated, mainly because bards are awesome PvPers, are fun to play, and it makes me sad to say this, but unless this bug is fixed the decision to play a bard on Live is about zero percent. ]</i></font><br><br>Looks like a bug. The team is aware of it, and we'll get it fixed before the server goes live. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You mentioned that you guys are leaning away from getting rid of the common tongue, such that everyone will be able to speak with everyone else. Are you sticking to that decision? Could you ask us players if we have a preference? :)  I mean, if the premise here is "hardcore roleplaying", inserting a language barrier seems like a logical step. If racial prejudices are going to become an important aspect of the server, it'd seem like a nice way to stir up conflicts a little by adding the confusion of an inability to comunicate. <br><br>And past that, it'd give people a reason to use the languages system that's already in the game. While I forsee that in the distant future everyone will have learned every spoken language just to avoid frustration (unless you could maybe limit the languages a person knows going by their intelligence score?), it'd at least make diplomacy something that requires a conscious effort. <br><br>-Ereet ]</i></font><br><br>We don't plan to make any language changes for this server. Any such changes will be a part of the consideration for a 'roleplaying' server at some (hopefully near) future time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Please take the time to read and listen to my concerns over the possible destruction of my guild. <br><br>That sounds ominous, I know, but that's exactly how much it frightened me to hear that there's the possibility of hardcoded teams on Vallon Zek. My concern stems from the fact that a "maybe" comment was given when you were asked if any of the rules from Sullon Zek would migrate to the Teams servers. Yes, I am aware that the Teams servers were set up to allow a four way war among the race teams. However, as far as I'm aware, it has never been mandated that we MUST wage a four way war among the race teams. Having the option to PvP with the other teams is great, but what of alliances? What of treaties and teaming up against the common foe? What of Roleplaying Good against Evil, Light against Dark? Hardcoding the teams on Vallon Zek would disallow such things. Yes, I know that there are players who are begging for exactly that, but now that they have Sullon Zek, I'm hoping that Vallon and Tallon Zek will be left as is, or at the very least, that one will be left as is, with a movelog enabled to allow a choice. <br><br>You see, my guild is a "Lighty" guild. It's composed of members from the three "Light" (ie non-Dark) races, with the exception of SK's and Necro's. That's right, we willingly accept the handicap of not having SK's and Necro's, to Roleplay a guild of Light Races that battles Dark Races exclusively, in a war of Good vs Evil. We also enjoy PvE, operating as a team of guildmates supporting each other. Disallowing benificial buffs and heals to be cast across the race teams would ruin our ability to function as a guild in PvE AND PvP. In short, hardcoding the teams would destroy our guild. Destroy our guild, and it would destroy our desire to play. <br><br>My plea is this: Please allow at least ONE (if not both) of the Teams servers to remain as is, with regards to PvP rules. If any of the Sullon Zek rules (hardcoded teams, XP loss for PvP, etc) are migrated to a Teams server, then please only do this to one of them, and allow the other to stay the same, with a movelog to allow us the choice of how to play. We "Light vs. Dark" players enjoy the game, and want to continue to enjoy the game, but we can't play the game on non-PvP servers (because we can't fight the Dark races), and we can't play it on Sullon Zek (because we can't be a unified guild of Light races), so the only place we CAN play the game we love so much, is on Vallon and Tallon Zek. <br><br>I understand the desire of those who want to play the game of PvP with hardcoded teams. I'm glad that they have such a place now, on Sullon Zek. I would even understand it if ONE of the existing PvP Teams servers were changed to have hardcoded race teams, to suit the purists. However, please understand OUR (my guild and those like us) desire to play without hardcoded teams so that we can play "Light vs. Dark"/"Good vs. Evil" as well. We have such a place on Vallon and Tallon Zek, and we hope that it doesn't go away. <br><br>Again, there is a rich and thriving community already in place on Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek. Guilds with history and reputations (both good and bad). While some choose to play racial purists (which is currently supported by the rules) others choose to band together members of two, three, or even all four races to fight a common foe (which is ALSO currently supported by the rules). Disallowing cross-team buffs and heals in the future would destroy the existing community, wipe out many of the established guilds, and cause many, myself included, to simply quit playing because we would have lost our main source of enjoyment: our family. <br><br>Light vs. Dark players love EQ, too, Absor. Please keep at least one server available for us. <br><br>Thank you for reading, Absor, I do appreciate the work you do. Please communicate my fears and concerns to the appropriate people. I hope my fears are put to rest, for I do love playing EQ, but could not continue to play if my family (my guild) were destroyed. <br><br>Feel free to e-mail me privately if you don't want to post this on the Developer's Corner, although you may certainly do so if you wish. <br><br>Again, thanks. <br><br>Taliaferro Erucolindo<br>Officer of Giliath Lang<br>Vallon Zek<br>"My team? My team is Giliath Lang!" ]</i></font><br><br>I can't tell you what will happen about this, I don't know for certain yet. <br><br>But as far as I can tell, 'cross-teaming' was never intended on the team servers. It should be pretty obvious that the intent was that there be four teams, not two. And I fully expect (though, as I said, I'm not certain yet) that the teams will be locked down in the near future. <br><br>How that happens, whether it's both servers or just one (or neither&#8230;), I don't know. <br><br>This certainly does not mean that we think that there isn't some viability to a good vs. evil team server. It's obvious that there is. <br><br>And, frankly, in my opinion there are far too many 'abuses' available to people that cross team. Obviously I am not implying that you or your guild are the type of people to use such abuses, I wouldn't know. But the entire idea that it is possible to create immune healers and such by the existing system is something that bothers me a lot. <br><br>Unfortunately, you'll have to wait a while for a final decision about the existing PvP servers as far as rule changes and such go. <br><br>Well, there have been nearly 500 comments since I opened this thread. Even those that haven't like certain of the decisions that we've made, have been enthusiastic about the idea in general. I'm very encouraged. Thanks for all the feedback.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000204.html"><b>More Pet Questions</b></a><br>-Tamria- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Whilst I'm not particularly bothered about pets poofing when I invis or ITU as I've gotten used to it. I think you insult the majority of pet class players by implying that a smart player shouldn't find it a problem. <br><br>There are many times I will be in a dungeon or somewhere and need to invis (whether to check out a spawn, go guide a friend in, go drag someone's corpse etc) but also want to keep my pet for saftey and convenience.

Like I said it's not a big deal to me, I got used to it many levels ago - just don't offend me by claiming it's not an issue for smart players. ]</i></font><br><br>Oh, now come on. I never said that any pet player was not smart for having to deal with these issues. What I said was that how you deal with them will determine if you are a good pet caster or a not so good one. It has nothing to do with being smart. I think of myself as smart, but I'm also not good at accounting. I have trouble learning new languages. But that doesn't mean I'm stupid. <br><br>The decisions that you make when playing your pet class has everything to do with how well you do with that character. It is indeed a problem for anyone playing such a class that they need to decide on the trade-offs all the time, no matter how smart they are.<br> <br>Don't try to make it sound like I'm calling anyone stupid because they have to decide which pet to summon for which location, or whether or not to try to keep their pet with them while looking for a corpse. The obstacles themselves (which is what I was talking about) have nothing to do with the abilities that people bring to bear for getting past them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm glad the owner doesnt panic and go poof when air pet goes invis :)<br><br>Lozza<br>TZ ]</i></font><br><br>Some do&#8230; :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000202.html"><b>Summon Companion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Quote - Number 1 sounds like it might be a bug. Pretty rare case, but I'll pass that on to Ester. <br><br>Very nice of you to finally mention this, as I have personally submitted detailed information regarding this very case. <br><br>A couple things:<br>1) It is NOT a rare case. This is an absolute fact, which happens every time a pet owner gets charmed. I can personally duplicate this to any VI staff in-game as many times as they wish. GM's have replied to my /bugreport and /petition's saying it is intentional to force pet owners to camp or zone after getting charmed to regain the ability to summon / resummon a pet. <br><br>2) I have personally submitted this very problem to these boards in excess of 5 times. I have used /bug and /petition in-game over a dozen times submitting this very problem. So, though I am only one person, VI has heard of this bug many times. <br><br>3) Bug or intentional, it is NOT fair in "any" circumstance for pet owners to be stripped of their ability to summon / resummon their pet. If this is a bug, please fix it promptly. If this is intentional, please seek employment elsewhere. <br><br>4) The "rogue pet" fix only removed the ability for players to create a rogue pet without the intervention of a NPC. A pet which is charmed by a NPC will become a experience-giving KOS to everybody NPC if the pet owner zones. <br><br>I have personally had my level 54 water pet get charmed by the level 30ish NPC enchanter at the lake in Qeynos Hills. When I zoned back, there was my old water pet, scowling, and killing all NPC's that came within range, including the original NPC which charmed it. Fortunately, the pet gives pretty good experience per kill. <br><br>-Anthe ]</i></font><br><br>When I said that it sounded like a rare case, I meant just that. It's probably not that common that you get charmed. I have no problem believing that it happens every time you DO get charmed, just that being charmed isn't something that happens every day to a character. <br><br>And I looked it up. The bug has been in the database since December. So we are aware of it, and have been. Obviously we haven't been quick to fix the bug, but we are certainly aware of it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I commend Verant for giving this to all the pet classes, and realizing it has little to do with roleplay, balance, or power but is a nice solution to some gameplay limitations (i.e., pathing). Just why did it take you so long to reach that decision after granting it to Mages? This will be a big help to the main pet classes - mages and necros and is the appropriate level at 44 as at lvl 46 planes and bigger raids begin for most charaters. <br><br>Now if you would only do something about fear and resists for necro pets it just might provide the necro with one of their primary weapons in raids/epic encounters. <br><br>Sarasate ]</i></font><br><br>Well, this is a case where were conflicted. There was a feeling that we should try to further distinguish magicians and their power over their pets, and also the feeling that it would be a useful tool for any pet caster. <br><br>We decided to err (if we were indeed erring) on the side of caution and give it only to magicians (imagine the issues if we gave it to everyone first and then decided to make it a magician only spell&#8230;). After letting it stew a while, we've decided to change our minds. <br><br>As for the fear thing&#8230; you'll have to wait a bit and see what or if we do anything with that. The same issue applies here. But, unlike Summon Companion, there is no clear need for fear resistance as a matter of a gameplay issue. It is something to consider for a 'class balance' issue, but that issue is two-sided. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Please dont give this spell to Enchanters.. <br><br>Enchanters mess with the Mind and Enchant lumps of stuff.. <br><br>I do not want the ability to "Summon".

I suggest that you will find it useful in some cases. And, well, who in the world would say no to a new spell? Seems odd to me. <br><br>As for your concern that there is no 'roleplaying' reason to have it, I have the easy answer. Don't buy it if it doesn't fit your concept of an enchanter. <br><br>Aeadiel-Sevaan wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Does this spell wipe pets aggro list? If it doesnt i think it should.

I'd imagine the necromancers out there wouldnt mind giving Goner someone to chat with who was likewise summoned to to anothers bidding. I can even see it now: Goner & Jibantik- of course, the militia wouldnt enjoy their jokes if the casters brought their act to the stage in freeport! ]</i></font><br><br>It is certainly a possibility that all pet classes could get Voice Graft.

Brad spoke on exploiting bugs in response to more feedback and letters received about the banning of the guild Conquest.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000211.html">update</a> from the Dev Corner:<UL>Hello all, <br><br>Recently I've not only received emails specifically regarding the Conquest guild issue, but also about exploiting in general. <br><br>First, some people are confused as to what an exploit is and how they're to know what an exploit is. Some are also afraid they might accidentally exploit and then be disciplined. <br><br>An exploit, quite simply, is using a bug in the game to your advantage. Most of them are obvious: attacking NPCs that are stuck, or the ability to duplicate items or money. But we do realize it's not always easy to tell. <br><br>To this end it has been and will continue to be our policy to warn people when they are caught exploiting. It basically works like this: <br><br>1. You are caught exploiting, you receive a warning and the exploit is explained to you.<br>2. You are caught exploiting again (this includes either literally being caught or caught and we have evidence you were aware it was an exploit -- in other words, premeditated exploiting) and you are suspended for a period of time.<br>3. You are caught exploiting yet again -- you are banned. <br><br>A second issue that's arisen is the question: why do we care if people are exploiting? Are we just upset they're not playing the game the way we wanted them to? <br><br>The answer is honestly "no, that has nothing to do with it." The following is an email and my reply to it which I think more clearly explains why we cannot allow bug exploitation in EverQuest: <br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: Robert Mayer <br>Sent: Tuesday, June 12, 2001 7:30 AM<br>To: bmcquaid@verant.com<br>Subject: Question <br><br><b>You guys seem to be holding players responsible for doing things the game allows but you don't intend to happen. You are labeling as "exploits" anything that is possible, but doesn't fit into the game as you designed it. </b><br><br>Then I guess I failed to communicate the issues very effectively, because that is absolutely NOT what we're doing. We are labeling exploits as we always have, that being using bugs to your advantage in-game. Conquest used spell stacking bugs to their advantage and they used a safe zone (an area where a pathing bug made it such that an NPC wouldn't pursue those it was mad at) to their advantage.<br><br><br><b>Now correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that in effect you're saying "look, we aren't perfect, we can't code a game that is 100% free of loopholes because nobody can, but you should as players be able to infer what we intend, and if you do things that are clearly going against our intent, that's an exploit and you'll be disciplined." </b><br><br>Yes and no. We're saying that taking advantage of bugs is NOT ok. And we're saying that 1. knowing you're exploiting a bug and 2. where and to what end your exploiting, are both factors in determining how we react to a player or players who are exploiting. <br><br><br><b>Whew. I've never heard a game company essentially say that the players are responsible for the developer's programming, design, and implementation errors. No offense, because I realize it's a bitch to run a game like EQ, but it seems absurd to me to expect players to do anything but try their utmost to use every single tool you give them, deliberately or accidentally, to succeed. After all, the only point of EQ, beyond chatting, is to level up, and the only rewards beyond the social come from leveling up and killing things. You put umpteen thousand people into a world and tell them "go forth and kill MOBs," and by gum they're gonna do it. You can't reasonably then expect them to adhere to something like "oh, and only kill MOBs the way we intend for you to kill them!" </b><br><br>No, they're responsible for not taking advantage of bugs in-between the time they're discovered and when we have a chance to fix them. And we've always had this policy. UO certainly has this policy, and I think AC does to an extent now. And I'd submit the majority of persistent, massively multiplayer community based games in the future will have these policies. Why? Well, because what you do in a community based game like this affects other players. If you take advantage of a dupe bug, you can hurt the economy, and ruin the play experience of hundreds if not thousands of other players. If you take advantage of a pathing bug and kill a monster to obtain loot that you really shouldn't be able to, then the guy who did work harder to obtain that same loot without exploiting is not going to feel very entertained. Rather, he's going to feel frustrated and perhaps even regret that he did it the 'right way'. It's the same as in real life -- society is generally NOT ok with taking short cuts (especially at the expense of others). Insider Trading is not ok. Cutting through a parking lot to avoid traffic is not ok. Embezzling and stealing and cheating to advance oneself at the expense of others is NOT ok. And so why the heck should it be ok in the communities and societies that are being developed in online computer games? Because it's a game? Does my sense of accomplishment and are my feelings about right and wrong somehow less valid inside a virtual reality than they are in the real world? <br><br>No man is an island, and that includes a person in Norrath.<br><br><br><b>From reading all of the public info on the Conquest incident, it seems to me that these guys simply took advantage of holes your programmers left in the game. If an NPC can't summon or move for X seconds or due to Y geometry, um, tough titty to you, Kitty--fix it. If you leave it in, you can't ethically blame someone for taking advantage of it. It's your responsibility, and you'rs (Verant's) alone, to make the game unexploitable. </b><br><br>Agreed to a point, and expanding on that, it's Verant's responsibility to make sure we are offering an entertaining and fair play environment for our customers. And so we fix bugs, and we also crack down on players who would use bugs to cheapen the playing experience of others.<br><br>And I disagree it's unethical to blame a player for taking advantage of a bug. If a person leaves the door open at their place of business, thereby creating a hole in the company's security, yes, it's the person's fault for doing this. But that doesn't mean it's ok for someone to come along and enter the building, taking advantage of the open door. He gets blamed too.<br><br><br><b>Now, if players change the code, hack it, or abuse other players, disciplinary action seems warranted. But to even bother suspending players whose only real "crime" seems to be to take advantage of coding problems on your end--well, you're asking way too much of your customers. </b><br><br>But taking advantage of coding or data problems can in some cases ABUSE OTHER PLAYERS, which is the point I apparently failed miserably to communicate, because it keeps coming up, not just in your email but in others.<br><br><br><b>Once you create the world, it isn't yours any more, just like when a novelist writes a book. If someone wants to interpret The Stand as an allegory about French cooking, there's nothing Stephen King can do about it. Yeah, an online game isn't as passive as a book, but it's the same concept. You guys seem to be holding on way too tight. Who cares if they "exploit" the flaws in the programming? Turn off the zone, fix the flaws, and go on. Every single exploit you guys identify should be seen as an opportunity to improve the game or refine it--that's good, and it's your right. But to discipline players for finding your mistakes&#8230; man, that's pretty low. </b><br><br>Again, reading a book is not a shared, community based experience. Misinterpreting a book, and for a better analogy, cheating in a single player game does NOT hurt the play experience for others. But, and this is the key point here, cheating in a shared community based online experience DOES. <br><br>thanks,<br><br>-- <br>--------------------------------------------- <br>Brad McQuaid <br>Vice President, Premium Games <br>Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive <br>---------------------------------------------</UL>

Banegrivm Shadowblight sends us the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>For some time now there have been strange occurrences happening about the <br>lands of Norrath as we know of it.

Through rain, snow, sleet and rain (not to mention server problems) we present to you today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000180.html"><b>Spelling Errors</b></a><br>First, I want to thank all of you that have been sending in spelling errors. I have a few comments to make about some of the types of comments we've been getting. <br><br>A few people have pointed out that when you use the Hail feature, it creates a sentence like: "Hail Bob." Such a sentence should, we admit, have a comma after the word hail. It should read: "Hail, Bob." <br><br>Unfortunately, changing that would be a real problem. NPCs are trained (through expensive drug therapy) to respond to the existing text, without the comma. Retraining them (which would probably mean intensive electric shock therapy) would require that we change every NPC that responds to that hail text. While perhaps a worthwhile endeavor, we have decided that the grammatical headaches that this causes some people doesn't warrant the time needed to make the change, and the likely bugs and broken quests that would occur. Sorry, but it's going to stay as it is. <br><br>Also, we've had a lot of comments about things on the character creation screens. Those have to be changed by programmers, not designers. We've created an extensive list of changes needed, and the programmers will be fixing them when they get the odd spare moment. That's just going to take time to finish, since it seems more worthwhile to have the programmers working on other things most of the time. <br><br>Otherwise, we are tackling the spelling errors as they come in. Many of the ones you've sent in are already fixed. Thanks for the help in this.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000071.html"><b>Quivers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The code that makes different kinds of arrows feed into the ammo slot from a quiver doesn't currently work.

This is also a test server which means that there is no customer service on this server. This is different than most people are used to. <br><br>What does this mean? It means that /petitions are not going to be answered unless they are about a bug, it means that there is no one to give last names, no one to get involved in player disputes. <br><br>This means if your name if offensive it will be changed without warning and your account may have action taken against it. Please do not make vulgar names. If your name is changed arguing will not help as this is a test server that will be wiped soon. <br><br>We also ask that you not sent tells concerning these things to our testers. They are not allowed to help you with these issues. <br><br>We appreciate all the help we get testing this code, but please remember that we are here to test and that is our primary responsibility. My testers are very limited on what they can do for customers. <br><br>I look forward to seeing you there! <br><br>Ester <br>--------------------------------------<br><br>And also keep in mind that our Development Team is spending a lot of time on this server, both playing and working. And we're just as willing to issue warnings and change names as anyone. Yes, being a jerk on the Test Server can earn you a warning or suspension just like it can on any other server. I've encountered a lot of nice folks (even a few of those that killed me this weekend were very nice about it&#8230;). But I've also run into some folks with some very foul mouths. Keep in mind that I'm very willing to petition people and send their information over to our Customer Service folks&#8230; <br><br>And please, please report any bugs you find using /bug. Be detailed in your description. We're concentrating on bugs regarding the new code on this server. <br><br>I've also encountered a lot of people that didn't know the rules for the new server. I'm not sure what good it will do posting a note here, since those that didn't read the original rules post will probably not see this either, but please read the rules before logging on. <br><br>Alan<br><br>---------<br><br>Sir_Yakk wrote: <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just so people know:<br>If you get 'name rejected', this is either because the name was rejected, or because you are trying to make a 2nd character. <br><br>Heh. <br><br>You might want to change the message you get when you want to make a 2nd character.

Why? ]</i></font><br><br>I agree, I expect there to be a fewer grief players when the server goes live. The freedom given by knowing that your character will be gone soon anyway makes people less concerned about their reputation. <br><br>No, the names need to be one color. We certainly talked about this, and I know why we can't make them different colors. Did you know that wood elves can be evil? Most people don't. Imagine being a wood elf and trying to visit your trainer with a big red name over your head. <br><br>My neutral dark elf has been attacked no less than fifteen times in Nektulos (oddly, I've been attacked more there than in Freeport&#8230;). Without an obvious name color, it's going to be very, very hard to play a character that isn't of the same religion as the majority of his peers. Giving them obvious team designations would make playing them impossible. <br><br>And we want to encourage people to respond to each other based on the character as much as their team.

So far it has been a blast and hopefully will only continue to improve once it goes live. However, after testing it these past few days I have noticed a quite disturbing trend, evil diety immunity. To put it bluntly, their is just too much evil, and on top of that concern, evil races such as Trolls, Ogres and in particular Iksars that have absolutely no concerns about being accousted for some time. I'm not posting this concerb because I feel good or even neutral aligned dietys should have an edge. However, I am concerned that too many subscribers will start as Troll, Ogre or Iksar because of thier relative immunity to attack or invasion. Think of it, no Troll, ogre or Iksar has to worry when they see a player of thier own race. Is this balance? Also, many of the better dungeons will be evil aligned dominated due to geography and the afformentioned dilemna. Not only is good severly hindered by this, but neutral too. Players will realize the easiest routes and most will head in that direction. And that direction is clearly evil. <br><br>I'm not implying VI should severely gimp evil. However, I am asking that the developers look into this and give serious consideration into introducing a neutral strain of Troll, Ogre and Iksar. Perhaps a neutral Shaman diety for all. Furthermore, moving one more diety to the good end of things may also add to the servers playability and resolve the evil immunity syndrom that may ultimately cripple the server. I only post this because I feel this would be best for the overall playability of Sullen-Zek and give the evil races something to think about. Something every good or neutral race has to deal with. Enemies in their own towns and a potential enemies in the same race. Otherewise, we may ultimately have an evil pvp server where no one actually fights. Thanks ]</i></font><br><br>That same immunity also leads to a few disadvantages. For example, if I see an iksar, I know he's evil. If I see a human I'll have to /con him to see what he is. So the same races that might have it easier because they are all on the same team, will find that any sort of stealth stuff isn't going to be useful. <br><br>You might be right, it might end up being that evil rules the server, and that the good folks are forced to work out alliances with the neutral ones to help survive. That's fine. Heck, that sounds very interesting. But it might also be true that a lot of people want to play good characters, and that the ease of finding and distinguishing evil targets is a burden on them. <br><br>The actual politics of the server will have to fall into place as it plays out. That's pretty thrilling, really. You might be right, but whether that's a good thing or a bad thing for the server as a whole, nobody really knows yet. <br><br>Niccy wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Something slightly odd here... <br><br>Ester- ...What does this mean?

So even if there is nobody to petition to, there will be a record. That means that if someone else petitions the same player for foul language, my report is still on file, adding to the evidence. And, well, I work here. So if someone is offensive enough, I can walk over and talk to someone about getting action taken&#8230; <br><br>Sure, trash talk is cool. At least trash talk in the sporting sense. But foul language is never going to be acceptable in EverQuest. If your character hates my character, that's fine. But if your character uses foul language to express that hatred, you can expect to find that the player is the one that gets warned. I've had interactions with people on that server that already that were hostile in character and pleasant out of character. That makes the thing fun. Making it personal ruins the game. <br><br>Enivri wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well Absor/Ester have posted another thing about the new test server, but I have YET to see this issue discussed: Rogue Pickpocketing.

Though it certainly will get a little discussion, since we could limit it to within the same five levels that looting and experience loss are limited to. But I wouldn't expect it. <br><br>Lisset wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Yes, you can trade across teams. I don't see any real reason to prevent people from trading." <br><br>There are roleplaying reasons and gameplay reasons. The RP reason is the same reason that you can't group with someone on another team and that is that your god would not permit you to render assistance to an enemy. Trading is the exact same thing. Is not selling someone a SoW potion the same thing as paying someone to cast sow on you? Also, I think you underestimate the number of people with multiple accounts. Heck, I know that if *I* built up a character on another team to the 50's and wanted to start a newbie, I'd certainly give it stuff, just because I can. <br><br>From a gameplay standpoint, I think you're missing a wonderful dynamic that preventing inter-team trades would create. If there is a certain item that is considered "great" (such as E-boots), a team can literally prevent other teams from getting them. The dynamic is jealousy. With enough cash, a player could ply an item off of an opponent. But without inter-team trading, that person (and others like him) would be jealous of that race. That creates even more conflict. ]</i></font><br><br>And on the other hand, there are some interesting possibilities that not allowing trading would restrict. In fact, in your example, imagine the wealth that can be gained by a team that is able to corner the market on something and then sell it. It also allows players to set up some of their own events, like convincing the evil guild leader to give up some item to a neutral guild to prevent them from aiding a good guild in some action. <br><br>I can see both sides here, and I can't see one as clearly better, except in one way. Sometimes it's just plain better to be able to help someone out. So if a neutral character sees a good character that has lost all of his stuff, he can help that person out a bit. I think that's the reason that I'm in favor of allowing trades across teams.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000201.html"><b>Slammin'</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: About the large races not having the ability to slam when in skeleton form - that is true of the other forms also. <br><br>As a barbarian warrior - I cannot slam when a group member gives me wolf or werewolf form. <br><br>Fre ]</i></font><br><br>That's true. But that's not an issue. Those spells always did that. The issue here is that we would be changing the functionality of an existing spell (adding a cool look, but adding a restriction). That would be why adding a new spell would be best. The new spell would still prevent slam, because that's what those sorts of spells do. But the old spell wouldn't be changed (ruined, in the minds of some players).<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000204.html"><b>Pets and Spells</b></a><br>Halbarad wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'd like to point out that this doesn't make any sense within the gameworld mechanics that I am aware of. <br><br>Invisibility has one effect, and one effect only: It prevents you from being added to a creature's hate list by moving close to it. (i.e. makes all creatures that don't see invisible indifferent to you). It does NOT prevent you from being added to the hate list for other reasons, nor does it remove you from the hate list if you are already on it. <br><br>Having your pet attack a creature adds aggro towards the caster; if it didn't, a monster wouldn't come after you if you had your pet attack it and your pet died. Being invisible will in no way protect you from the monster that just killed your pet, because you are on it's hate list, and it will find you and attack you. <br><br>So, insofar as I understand it, the above explanation doesn't hold water. Now, if you don't want someone to be able to travel invisibly with a pet, that's fine - just say so - but let's not have some confused explanation that makes it sound like aggro works differently than has always been demonstrated. <br><br>Oh... and as an aside, if, for some bizarre reason, you do happen to allow invisible casters with pets, could you make it so that /pet get lost breaks charm? Thanks. :)]</i></font><br><br>That is true, now. But back then invisibility, if cast before the pet attacked, would prevent you from getting onto the hate list of the NPC. So with the NPC targeted and the caster sitting out of sight, the caster could send pets in for as long as his or her mana held out. Both invisibility and the way pets work were changed because of exploits like that. It may be true that neither you nor I can think of any specific exploits that would come from reverting this. But I'm pretty convinced that some would crop up. <br><br>It works fine as it is now. The only reason to change it would be to reduce the thought required for pet casters (Should I cast now, or wait until we're further along? Will casting now cause me too much trouble?). The ability to know when to cast a pet is important to the smart pet caster, and can distinguish a well played magician from a poorly played one (though obviously less so that the ability to successfully command you pet). With the ability to summon your pet, I don't really see any need to change the way this works, and certainly not at the risk of a potential exploit. <br><br>Charm is a separate matter. Get lost doesn't break the charm because the pet can't choose to break the charm, you have to do that with the spells provided you.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar Class Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: since your on the topic of classes... <br><br>Why cant iksar be rogues? After all, the field of bone is full of them, though I would suppose they are outcasts from iksar society. I see no reason why they cant be rogues; the whole 'too primitive' argument goes out the window, because barbarians can be them and they are much more primitive then iksar, since they cannot harness intelligence(sorry for the bad spelling people) based magics. <br><br>Also, is there any chance, that with upcoming expansions( not luclin per se) that you will be adding new classes to the already existing races that they couldnt have been before?(ie making it so dark elves can be monks, or something along that lines) (well, maybe not darkies becoming monks...but you get my point). Sorry if the post is a little long winded or lacking in proper grammar and spelling and the such, I aint perfect, after all. <br><br>-TheSpineripper ]</i></font><br><br>I think I've said this before, but I'm more than willing to repeat myself. :)<br><br>There is, really, no reason that any race couldn't justify having any class. Dwarven bards, barbarian wizards, troll paladins&#8230; I can come up with a reason for any combination of class and race. <br><br>But we've set it up in such a way that your race and class combinations make a lot of sense in the world. We're not planning on adding or changing these combinations at all in the future. The variety and restrictions to the classes are just fine as they are. <br><br>Bahimiron wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: While we're on the subject: <br><br>Agnostic is defined as being in a state where one does not deny or affirm the existence of the gods. <br><br>Agnostic in Everquest is actually more non-denominational.

It appears one public statement wasn't enough to clear the waters for Verant regarding a controversial decision to disband and suspend an entire guild.  In public statement #2, EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid talks more on the issue and provides what only can be described as a monstor of an email discussion between him and the Guild's leader.  Here's the first part of the document:<UL>Hello,<br><br>After our first statement regarding the Conquest guild issue, several things happened. First, I began a dialog with two members of Conquest (the leader and an officer). Second, I began a very detailed investigation of what occurred. Third, the public interest in this situation continued with both public posts and well as emails to various Verant employees. <br><br>The following is a lengthy email exchange between me and the two guild members, and I'm releasing it (with their permission) as sort of a 'second, more definitive statement', in that much of the feedback we received and read indicated that many players were not satisfied with the depth (or lack thereof) of our original statement. That and, after further investigation on my part, there were a few errors in the original statement I wanted to clear up.<br><br>I think these various emails explain in detail both Verant's position and Conquest's regarding this issue. They are presented 'as is', except for spelling fixes and the deletion of email addresses and guild member names. Also, the last couple of emails between us are omitted in that they deal with some other issues not really related to what happened.<br><br>In any case, I hope this clears some things up and helps and doesn't merely 'throw more fuel on the fire'. I leave it to all of you to come to your own conclusions, but at least you have details on both sides of the issue as well as a good faith effort from both parties to get to the bottom of this situation. <br><br>--<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br>Brad McQuaid<br>Vice President, Premium Games<br>Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive<br>---------------------------------------------</UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000210.html">Click here</a> to read the very, very long email conversation had between Brad and the guild's leader.

He does his very best to make everyone around him angry and miserable. The Thief wants to take things, the Grief Player doesn't care about things except as they hurt other people. <br><br>One example of a Grief Player was one I met while supervising a group of children playing online. The children were obviously children; they were all playing big hulking warriors with Pokemon names. Some fellow saw them playing in the dungeon then ran off. He came back about 5 minutes later and offered to show them into a secret section of the dungeon. This section was much more difficult than the rest of the dungeon. He led the children down into it and they were lulled by the fact that there were no monsters. He had killed them all before bringing the children down. Then he went to great lengths to lead the children in circles so that they were lost and then quietly left just as the dungeon refilled with monsters. <br><br>----------------<br><br><a href="http://www.fanstory.com/fanmag/">The Online Magazine</a><br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Lava</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
