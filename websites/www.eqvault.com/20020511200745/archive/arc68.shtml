Lefourgue informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>THE LOST SCROLL<br>A Roleplay event on Mithaniel Marr<br>When: Friday the 20h of October, from 3 PM to 6 PM (EST)<br>Where: East Commons, on Mithaniel Marr<br>Who: Lvl 6-10 characters<br><br>From Lefourgue Beauregard, head of the Lodge of Bayle:<br><br>Our investigation on the rumoured return of Miragul led us to study ancient<br>texts and records, relating the tragic tale of the woman who opened her arms<br>and her books of arcane lore for him. She was a Teir'Dal sorceress, the<br>first of her kind to tread so far on the forbidden path of Necromancy.<br>Her name was Argarwaen. A daughter of Neriak's royal family, she had no lust<br>for secular power, only for the surge of tainted mana and the thrill of<br>playing hide and seek with Death itself. Unwilling to play the political<br>game she was taught as a potential heir to the throne, she left her hometown<br>for newfound Erudin.<br><br>Her true nature disguised by powerful illusions, she learned much from the<br>Human mages. To those who had a dark shard stuck in their hearts, she taught<br>the rudiments of her own art. Thus, she built a court of followers. It is<br>well known how Miragul joined this secret college of outcasts. But few are<br>those who know that he became the lover of the Teir'Dal princess.<br>When the war broke out between the Erudites and the Heretics, Miragul fled<br>north. As for Argarwaen, she left Odus and built herself an underground<br>palace in what is now known as the Commonlands. There, our sources diverge.<br>Some scholars pretend she became mad out of waiting for her lover's return,<br>others hint that she was cursed by Miragul himself because she had failed<br>him in one way of another, and a third school of thought suggests that Death<br>is not without its sick sense of humour, and that the Great Harvester of<br>Souls refused to sever Argarwaen's lifecord, sentencing the Dark Elf to an<br>eternity of torment. However, all agree on their conclusion: Argarwaen's<br>spirit never found peace.<br><br>What is the relevance of this story with our current research you may ask.<br>Well, learn that our Erudite brethren from Paineel have unearthed a long<br>forgotten scroll which could allow us to summon Argarwaen's restless ghost<br>and ask her about Miragul's whereabouts!<br><br>Alas, the scroll has been stolen by a perfidious shadowknight named<br>Filsdebayle. We tracked the traitor, cornered him in East Commons and killed<br>him, but the precious document was nowhere to find. Further investigation<br>led us to believe that it is now in the hands of the Deathfist Orcs, with<br>whom Filsdebayle had contracted an alliance...<br><br>/ooc GameLoft, a French site dedicated to EverQuest, invites all level 6-10<br>characters to attend its third in-game event, which will start in East<br>Commonlands, and culminate in Befallen. We promise you thrill, romance,<br>blood, spectacular lightshow and free beer! More precious gifts will also<br>reward the heroes of the event. Departure will take place at the Nektulos<br>pass in EC, but if you are late, you can join us at Orc 2 (until 4 PM). <br>To join in, please indicate your class, race and level to Radharc<br>[eobert@gameloft.com].

Lady Dae stopped by and responded to a few threads recently on the Arena board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000071.html"><b>Recent Bard Tournament</b></a><br>Do I expect a level 29 to defeat a level 39? <br><br>No I do not. <br><br>Do I expect a level 29 to enter the event for knowledge, learning, and to have fun, so that in future events he can do better? <br><br>Yes I do. <br><br>We are trying to make things fun for as many players as possible. This means that there needs to be a wide spread of levels. While I would love to keep it +/- 4 levels (Rallos Zek range), we are trying to get the excitement out to everyone. <br><br>We are aware of the level differences involved in the match. This is the best we can do with still having a decent size event, Im sorry. <br><br>We are aware of the twinking, and how they ruin events, but unless the items are obsene for their level, we are leaving them alone. Again, my appologies. <br><br>To give a breakdown on every piece of equipment that a player can and cannot have at level X is impossible. The GMs are allowed to use judgement on items that are way out of range, and ask the player to put those items away. <br><br>The issue that saddens me here is that no where in your wonderful post did you say you had fun. <br><br>We will work on making things better in the future, see you in the arena.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000074.html"><b>Short Notice on Tallon Zek</b></a><br>I have heard a lot of complaints about the limited warning on Tallon Zek. I have not yet heard any complaints about the Nameless Event that was also run today. <br><br>I will look into this matter and contact the Server Management Team of Tallon Zek and see if there was a breakdown in communication between the events staff and the Tallon Zek population. <br><br>While I would love to hold all events on the weekend, The Events staff at this time is not capable of fullfilling that request. If I had a team of 35 EventMasters, I would run them all on the weekend I assure you. <br><br>If I find out that Tallon Zek had little to no knowledge of the event before it was run, I will consider a second event and sending a second team to the finals. <br><br>This is still based on the results of the investigation that will be run, no promises at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000081.html"><b>Required Levels</b></a><br>There have been just as many, if not more, events given to the less then 50s then the greater then 50s. <br><br>At this time we do not give a lot of advanced warning on minor events, and just enough time on major events, so that the events can actually run. <br><br>If we gave a month warning for a mid level event, 300 people would show up and we would not be able to run it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000075.html"><b>Test of Tactics - Day One</b></a><br>Tallon Zek Winners : The Patryns<br>Tallon Zek Field Size : 8 Teams (55 Players) <br><br>Lazdal the Tactician (59 BAR SHA) <br><br>Tssunami (56 HUM MONK)<br>Druegan (55 DWA CLE)<br>Cuick the Silent(59 ELF ROG)<br>Lightadam (56 HIE WIZ)<br>Kreepindeath (58 HUM ENC)<br>Dumnezeu (53 HUM CLE) <br><br>The Nameless Winners : Legacy of Steel<br>The Nameless Field Size : 4 Teams (26 Players) <br><br>Tenaj the Tactician (60 DEL WIZ) <br><br>Magosian (59 HUM WIZ)<br>Ariel (60 ELF WAR)<br>Arlos (57 HUM MONK)<br>Vertulias (56 TRO WAR)<br>Barnabuss (60 DWA CLE) <br><br>This team waived the 7th person, which is within the rules. <br><br>Rule Change was made that if players wish to enter without the 5kpp entry fee, they may do so but waive their rights to prizes. <br><br>I will not be announcing the prizes of the event, if players wish to do so, that is their right. <br><br>More to come tomorrow, finalized scheduel will be posted tonight.</UL>

CoN has kicked up a <a href="http://con.xrgaming.net/brad.php3">new interview with Verant Vice President Brad McQuaid</a>.  The article features a few snapshots of Verant HQ as well as a few tidbits on Velious.  Here's a clip:<UL><i>Although we&#8217;ll see plenty of these new NPC&#8217;s, we won&#8217;t find any new player classes or races, focusing instead on adding hundreds of new quests. &#8220;The designers will be working up until the last minute and beyond putting as much content as possible,&#8221; assures Brad. &#8220;That&#8217;s usually our goal. How much is enough? There isn&#8217;t.&#8221; <br><br>When Kunark was released, players cheered because of the higher level limits that were added for characters. There&#8217;s no increase to the character level limit in Velious, but Brad hasn&#8217;t put the idea to rest. &#8220;Whether we decide to do one in the future or not, I can&#8217;t say for sure. There are a lot of variables involved. The more powerful creatures are fifty to sixtieth level, and we don&#8217;t want to let it get to the point where one player can just walk around killing dragons. That&#8217;s not immersive or &#8216;realistic&#8217; within the fiction.</i></UL>

Rbecka announces the following event:<BLOCKQUOTE>Name_Of_Submitter: Rbecka<br>Event_name: Nights of the Dying Undead<br>Email: <a href="mailto:rbecka@altavista.net">rbecka@altavista.net</a><br>Guild_Sponsoring_Event: Silver Daggers<br>Date: 11/11/2000<br>Time: 2:00 PM EST<br>Event_Description: Night of the Dying Undead<br><br>What: Raid on Kithicor (Karnan Server)<br>Who: Silver Daggers & all Allies (ammended to include all members of KCOG)<br>Level: 35+ (lower lvl (20-34) will be accepted, but may be posted at one of the zones in Kithicor &#8211; either WC, RV, or HH)<br>When: Saturday, Nov. 11th, 2 p.m. EST <br>Where: Meet in RiverVale<br><br>On Saturday, Nov 11th, at 2PM EST, the Silver Daggers along with all allies will be raiding Kithicor Forest. The raid is being organized by myself, Rbecka.. and Aalya (AKA &#8211; &#8216;The Sisters of Slash&#8217;) <br><br>Cassia, of the Silver Daggers, will be the battle commander for this raid. Watch for a follow-up post from her on how we will meet the raid's objectives.<br><br>Those needing teleports for the raid should contact me to arrange a ride. IMPORTANT: No teleports will be provided after the time listed above, unless it is during daylight hours.. as the primary hunt will be after dark.<br><br><br>The primary objective of the raid is to exact revenge on the massive quantities of undead that roam this zone and have been terrorizing folks for ages. Secondary objective will be, of course, whatever loot we can obtain and whatever experience can be gained. *** Note: it is highly possible due to the way this raid is going to be set up that your group may not gain very much in the way of experience. If this is objectionable to you, please make other arrangements for the day, because once groups are set up, if anyone leaves this could cause a major problem. (Can we say &#8216;don&#8217;t rock the boat&#8217;)?<br><br>Items will be lotto'd among the classes present who can use them using the /random 1 200 command. Ties will roll again. If no one present can use the item, the item will be lotto&#8217;d among the guilds present. When a lotto item is looted, the group leader should /tell me immediately what the item is. I will coordinate with the battle commander to hold the lotto between fights, with the group leader being responsible for handing off the item to the winner. Also &#8211; please note that there is a great deal of &#8216;no-drop&#8217; items in this zone &#8211; do not loot if you can not use it.<br><br>The group leaders will do all looting. (or a person designated by the group leader.) Split will be turned on, with gems & trinkets being donated to clerics & enchanters to help defray the cost of regents<br><br>Late arrivals to the raid should wait at the Rivervale zone and contact me via /tell. I will coordinate with the battle commander to have the person brought in. Under no circumstances should anyone try to reach the raiding party on their own. (Unless it is during daylight hours) Anyone who hears from a late arrival wishing to join the raid should send me a /tell with that information. If I do not respond in a reasonable amount of time, send the /tell again until I do acknowledge it. Late arrivals may have to wait a few minutes, but we will get them in to join the raid. All participants will be eligible for lottos and will receive an equal share of the group loot, butif you are a late arrival, you will not be eligible for the first lotto of an item that can be used by your class. (unless you are the only member of your class present)<br><br>The battle commander will designate a puller.(Hopefully with Kithicor experience.) Anyone wishing to learn from the designated puller should contact me via /tell once we have reached the area of the forest we will hold. I will coordinate with the battle commander and all requests to learn the area will be accommodated if at all possible.<br><br>All communication with me, as the raid organizer, will be via /tell, leaving the public channels open for use by the battle commander. As a reminder, we are attempting to increase our raid success rate by paying more attention to group and raid discipline. Players who repeatedly break discipline may be asked to leave the raid. Warnings, and removal from the raid in the unlikely event that it should become necessary, will be handled by me via /tell. <br><br>Official beverage for this hunt is my own personal favorite: Kalish. Feel free to bring as much as you wish, for there will be plenty of downtime during daylight hours.<br><br><br>Hope to see you all in Kithicor. May the &#8216;undead&#8217; die again <br><br>Signup list is posted at: <a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/fsilverdaggersevents.showMessage?topicID=213.topic">http://pub3.ezboard.com/fsilverdaggersevents.showMessage?topicID=213.topic</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

A <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/024394.html">big announcement</a> was posted this evening to the Gameplay Board by Verant Interactive's Gordon Wrinn.  In this post he announces his promotion to Associate Producer of EQ Live and the Scars of Velious as well as welcoming Alan &#8220;Absor&#8221; VanCouvering, formly EQX's editor-in-chief, as his replacement.  Here's the complete letter:<UL><i>Hello all, <br><br>We've got a new producer letter going up here in the next few minutes. I thought I'd stop by here and post it special for those camping the boards <br><br>-Gordon<br><br>------<br><br>Hello all,<br><br>It seems like only yesterday that I came to Verant to build our community relations by acting as a two-way conduit of information between the players and the development team. In fact, it&#8217;s been nearly a year since I began representing the company to the players, and in return, the players to the company. <br><br>We&#8217;ve certainly had some bumps in the road, but overall I think that the development team and the community of players have grown much closer over the past year. We&#8217;ve addressed a lot of issues, solved a number of problems, and overall improved the game as a result of our relationship. We now have more development team members posting on the boards than ever before and our response time to issues in game has dropped dramatically. Furthermore, we&#8217;ve become much more flexible in terms of addressing everyone&#8217;s issues. We&#8217;ve seen a number of old bugs addressed, and implemented numerous enhancements, both those related to a particular class, and to the players as a whole. <br><br>Many of you have noticed that I&#8217;ve been around a little less than normal over the past couple of weeks. Some have gotten the impression that we&#8217;d become less resilient in our goal to maintain a strong community. I can now let everyone know that this is not the case, that our commitment to our players is stronger than ever, and that we remain committed to continually improving our relationship with EverQuest players.<br><br>Today I am pleased to announce that Alan &#8220;Absor&#8221; VanCouvering, formerly of EverQuest Express (eqx.simplenet.com), has joined the EverQuest Team. Alan will be taking over my position as Community Relations Manager of EverQuest, and will be responsible for taking our community relations to the next level. Alan has been the editor of EverQuest Express since early beta, and comes to us with nearly 10 years of customer service experience. Please make him feel at home and take it easy on him until he comes up to speed. Alan has posted an introduction below.<br><br>With Alan coming on, I&#8217;ve moved to the development team as Associate Producer of EQLive and the Scars of Velious, under Jeff Butler. I&#8217;ll be concentrating more on the &#8220;Live&#8221; side of things, with coordination of day-to-day operations of EverQuest being among my responsibilities. I&#8217;ll still stop by the boards from time to time, as they remain an excellent resource for information and player feedback, but Alan will be your point-man there. While I&#8217;m proud of the work we&#8217;ve done over the past year, I&#8217;m very excited about this new opportunity, and am equally glad that we were able to bring Alan on.<br><br>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to address your concerns and making me a part of your EverQuest experience. <br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Gordon &#8220;Abashi&#8221; Wrinn<br>Associate Producer, EQLive and the Scars of Velious<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.<br><br>-------<br><br>Hello everyone.<br><br>My name is Alan VanCouvering. As Gordon mentioned, I will be taking over as Community Relations Manager for EverQuest here at Verant Interactive, Inc.<br><br>Let me start by giving you an idea what it is that I will be doing under the auspice of the wordy title &#8220;Community Relations Manager&#8221;. It will be my job to understand the players&#8217; concerns about EverQuest and to get those concerns to the development team. It will also be my job to get responses to those concerns back to the players and to help the development team to speak with the community. There will be other tasks (I imagine there will be loads of other tasks), but that&#8217;s my primary job.<br><br>Until recently, very recently, I&#8217;ve been a player. I have been involved with EverQuest as a tester and a&#8230; commentator about the game since the early beta. Some of you may know me as Absor from EverQuest Express. I&#8217;m not going to claim to know everything that there is to know about the game. I don&#8217;t know where all the problems lie, and I don&#8217;t know all the good things. Of course I will be trying to absorb everything that I can from the designers here and from the players. But let me apologize now if I don&#8217;t know all the answers to your questions.<br><br>I hope that you will bring your concerns to me so that I can understand them. Don&#8217;t be afraid to over-explain something to me. And don&#8217;t be too surprised if I ask for clarifications on a point or two. I haven&#8217;t played all the classes to 60th level, so I may not understand the problems with &#8220;x&#8221; item or &#8220;y&#8221; class from personal experience.

Here are the posts Gordon wrote today on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/024050.html"><b>Official Page Updates</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Months ago it was suggested that all the patch information be archived on your website so people could view the changes overtime, was this ever done I cannot find a link?]</i></font> <br><br>It's not done yet, I'll see about getting a status report on Monday. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Also things in development have either been implemented or have been scrapped. Will the main webpage ever be current?]</i></font> <br><br>I've noticed that the page is a little out of date. Several of the items listed have already been done, while others are still planned. I'll see about getting it updated in the near future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/024026.html"><b>Credit Cards</b></a><br>Visa debit cards work as well. You should be able to get one of those providing that you have a checking account. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What really upset me is, when I bought it, nowhere on the box did it say "Credit Card Required" ]</i></font><br><br>I'll have to doublecheck my boxes on Monday, but I'm about 98% sure that all versions of the printed boxes indicate that a credit card is required.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/024016.html"><b>Modem Problems</b></a><br>The way certain critical data is encrypted does not cause what you are experiencing. The encryption for all intents and purposes is no different than the old one. We just removed what is called a "known plaintext" crack. <br><br>If you've been disconnecting every 30 minutes, I strongly suggest that you look into your ISP, and also see if other people on the same ISP are having the same problems if you have access to such information. <br><br>There's nothing that we're doing that would cause you to lose sync. I suspect what is happening is a thermal error: A component in your modem is getting hot from continuous packet processing, which causes you to crap out once in a while, giving that component a chance to cool off.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023999.html"><b>PvP Experience Loss</b></a><br>There are ways that players can cause others experience loss on the PvP servers. Doing this intentionally is, as mentioned before, not allowed on the servers and will sooner or later result in expulsion should someone make a habit of it. That said, the fact that experience loss does occur in some cases (like this one, or like one where someone plays 'root the kiting druid') cannot be eliminated due to limitations to the game engine necessary to maintain the PvE aspects of the game. These issues are not bugs, and as such are not eligible for GM resurrection. <br><br>In short, there are times when engaging in PvP that you can lose experience. <br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: let me put this situation on the board for you. a lvl 60 wiz goes into the arena, while a large event is being held there, he goes into the pvp area, then pulls the plug, wham, everyone in there dies, and looses exp?]</i></font> <br><br>Not if you are in the PvP section of the arena, which is hardcoded to ignore XP-loss since there are no PvE aspects to consider. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: has this ever happened to you abashi?]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, I have indeed lost experience during PvP encounters. It's a pain, but experience loss is always a possible outcome of death. If anything it made me more cautious. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: if you continue to give "prewritten responses" and dont give people a chance neither let them think. abashi, i think you try your best. it just isnt good enough to hold water. ]</i></font><br><br>I never use prewritten responses, it's just that there are only so many ways to state the same thing. Sooner or later I settle into the best one I've found. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: you are slowly lowering the population of your servers and soon you will be dust in the wind. ]</i></font><br><br>EverQuest is very strong. In fact last week we hit another new record for simultaneous people online (over 68K). We tend to hit one about every other week.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023979.html"><b>(Client Warning) What is it?</b></a><br>Sounds like a sync problem. <br><br>Not everything in the game is either on the client or the server, some things are done on both. For example, if something is controlled server-side, the server has to tell the client what is or what is not legal (requiring network traffic). If it's controlled client-side, the client tells the server what is and what is not illegal (also requring network traffic). <br><br>In cases where something is on both ends, both the client and the server decide what is legal, and the only time there is network traffic regarding the illegality of an operation is when they are in disagreement. <br><br>Spell-casting is a good example of this. The client knows the delays of spells and makes buttons visible or grays them out based on this. Someone can hack their client to make it ungray spells sooner than it should. However, in case someone does that, the server also knows the delay of spells and will "speak up" should someone send bad data. Overall it results in far less network traffic than having everything controlled on one side. <br><br>The lag that you experienced in this case appeared to cause out-of-the-ordinary delays that caused the server and client to lose sync. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023998.html"><b>More Epic Weapon Debate</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Please explain yourself. In another post you said that these items were never meant to come into the game enmass because that would throw off the balance of the game. What you are really saying here is that if you don't play the game 40 hours a week, or don't belong to an UBER guild, your just SOL. ]</i></font><br><br>The quests are meant to be completed by people who can get help from a good number of other people. While I don't think that it means that you *must* be in a "uberguild", it certainly wouldn't hurt. These are top of the line items, and "top of the line" items aren't typically meant to be acquired solo. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: far it appears that everyone who has recieved the EPIC weapon has been a member or a friend of just such a guild.]</i></font> <br><br>I imagine that it's hard to find someone in the 50-60 range who could get enough support without having a guild or friends in such a guild to help. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If this is the case, just come out and tell us that most players will not be able to obtain their class defining weapon because they are either not connected socially or they have a life away from the game.]</i></font> <br><br>The vast majority of players in the level range to acquire these items is either in, or have friends in, a guild. Still, most players will not obtain the epic quest item period, regardless of guild status or level. Though I understand your feelings regarding the issue, it is intended to be this way. As I've posted before, no one is "entitled" to items in the game. Things that we want universally available are sold on vendors. <br><br>Guys, it's about prestige. These are meant to be prestigous items to have. If everyone has them, there's no prestige in having one.<br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:What is your definition of dedication?]</i></font>  <br><br>My definition would be something along the lines of "Willing to do what it takes to accomplish a goal". I would imagine however that the question is more along the lines of, what does it mean to you? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:I have to agree with Abashi on this one (GASP!).]</i></font>  <br><br>Double gasp! :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "If everyone is the exception then the exception becomes the norm".]</i></font>  <br><br>That's a good quote, one for my files for sure. Do you know who it's attributed to?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023708.html"><b>"When Install Doubt Fails"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: <a href="http://www130.pair.com/seliris/TeasingCat.mpg">http://www130.pair.com/seliris/TeasingCat.mpg</a> ]</i></font><br><br>This one is good.

Spuff informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night, on Eci, the Halflings of the Vale met an unexpected foe turned <br>friend.<br><br>While wandering through the thicket, a young druid Maladdar stumbled upon <br>two gigantic named bixies.  Wondering what this was about, he considered <br>them to be indifferent at the time.  A partner along side him, scared by <br>such a large creature, instinctively started casting a spell upon it to slow <br>it down.  The poor bixie got very upset and started trying to attack the <br>halfling.<br><br>Many halfling friends noticed the young man under distress, and came to his <br>aid.  A battle was waged against the two bixies, whereupon they both quickly <br>fluttered away.  Suddenly, minutes later, an ominous voice buzzed throughout <br>the zone.  "Zzztayy aawwaayy ffroomm tthhee caavvee".  Sensing something was <br>about to take place at Runny-Eye, Malladdar and a group of individuals <br>boldly headed towards the cave to  inquire what this disruption to the <br>otherwise peacefull vale was.<br><br>Upon arrival, the seen was a mess.

They sent down some bixies to inquire the aide of the young ones of <br>rivervale, whereupon they were assaulted!  We explained our fear of the <br>unknown, appologized for the attacks, and business resumed.<br><br>The bixies were here for one reason: their supply of Honey Jum was low for <br>the winter.

The following is this Saturday's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023867.html"><b>Epic Quests</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Frankly your odds of actually getting the loot needed are slim to none when every other mage on your server is vying for same thing. ]</i></font><br><br>As I mentioned in another post, this is how it's supposed to work. We *understand* that everyone wants these items. We created them in order to ensure that that would be the case. However we cannot *give* them to everyone without there being serious reprocussions on the balance of power in the world. <br><br>Remember that once these items go in, unless we create UberEpic quest items at some point in the future, they represent the most powerful item for your class in the game. Other held-items pale by comparison. We just can't have everyone running around with them and maintain some semblance of a game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023950.html"><b>DirectX Upgrade</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: While visiting test, I noticed that the frame rate does tend to get a bit jerky]</i></font> <br><br>There are some DX related framerate issues on Test that we're working on, and intend to fix before bringing the new changes live.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023973.html"><b>"Putting Two and Two Together"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -Brad has often said that more and more people are coming into the game.<br>-Gordon has often said that they wish to limit the rate at which rare items enter the game. <br><br>Well, maybe, if they put their heads together, and thought about it, they would see that they need to UP THE RATE RARE ITEMS ENTER THE WORLD AT!]</i></font> <br><br>Your point suggests that new people are all joining and wanting a piece of finite server resources, which isnt' the case. This is already happening. To use your two points above, we've added more servers, so technically items are entering the "game" faster, just by virtue of there being new servers. <br><br>Now on a per-world basis (which is what is important since the economy is measured on a per world basis), the rate at which items come in has also gone up, not by means of percentages, but as a result of item-carrying creatures being killed at a faster rate. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Frankly, I see NO advantage to restricting the rate at which powerful items enter the world, except to keep people playing for longer, which is, of course, the Vision in a nutshell. ]</i></font><br><br>Let's imagine a world where: Everyone has everything. Everyone starts at level 60, has an unlimited supply of platinum, and can buy everything off of vendors. Who would play on this server? A lot of people in the beginning, but that would soon drop off to nearly nothing when people realize that there is no challenge in obtaining anything. Item value, and in this case that value is the prestige in overcoming a challenge and having something that isn't too common, is inversely proportional to the availability of the item. This same formula can be applied to levels as well, which describes the "race to level" that exists on new servers.<br><br>So technically, yes, limited item availability is about getting people to subscribe to the game longer. Just as the experience curve does the same thing. But neither of these have a direct correlation. Item availability and speed of advancement correlate directly to challenge, and the prestige associated with overcoming that challenge. It is the challenge that directly correlates to the length of time that you play the game. <br><br>Games are about overcoming challenges. If we cease to provide you challenges to overcome, you will not play the game. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023988.html"><b>Karana</b></a><br>Karana was split very recently in the grand scheme of things. As it turns out not nearly as many people chose to split as we would have liked, even upon subsequent movelogs where we let it be known that we had tons of room and would be able to service all-comers. <br><br>Secondly, the "2500" figure that was being reported wasn't accurate. There's a problem that we're trying to nail down that causes the world server to stop releasing people when it is supposed to. When this happens, people can't get back into the server, and each attempt causes the population to increment even though they aren't successfully getting back in. We're trying to find out what causes this. It currently happens on one server once or twice a week, making it pretty intermittent.</UL>

Two new Patch Messages went up last night containing some important information:<UL>October 13th, 7:01pm<br>------------------------------<br><br><b>*Important System Configuration Announcement*</b><br><br>As many of you know, over the past couple of months we've made numerous enhancements to the EverQuest client. In addition to things such as new /-commands and other changes of that nature, we've enhanced the UI itself to allow moveable and resizable windows, among other things. At the same time we've been working on a brand new sound engine, and have been further concentrating on optimizing and expanding the capabilities of the EverQuest client.<br><br>For most applications, the feature set of a version of DirectX is limited to the lowest common denominator between the version that the software is compiled under, and the version running on the client. This means that though you may be running DirectX 7.0a already, and are receiving advantages associated with the more advanced code, the feature-set of DirectX used when in EverQuest is limited to version 5.2.<br><br>This limits the type and breadth of enhancements that can be made to the client. Given that we feel that EverQuest players would enjoy continuing to see new enhancements for the client, we will soon begin compiling the client under DirectX 7.0a, and implementing the feature-set available within that version. When we do this, everyone will need DirectX 7.0a (or higher) to play EverQuest. <br><br>Here are some of the possible benefits from DirectX 7.0a:<br><br>- Better performance (Graphics and Sound)<br>- Gamma Correction working in D3D <br>- Proper Mip-Mapping in D3D <br>- Fixes fogging on some cards. (Some cards have no fogging at all and look pretty bad) <br>- Allows us to use newer interfaces to support such features as full-screen anti-aliasing, and alternate Z-buffering methods, which tend to look better.<br><br>Changing to DX7 does have a potential downside. Those using older or discontinued video or sound cards that do not have DX7 compatible drivers may need to upgrade to continue playing. However, we feel that the benefits that will come from upgrading to this newer version of DirectX outweigh the potential problems.<br><br>We plan to begin requiring DirectX7.0a when the EverQuest client is next patched, in two or three weeks. We wanted to be sure to give everyone enough time to check their version of DirectX and install the newest version. You can run DXDIAG.EXE in your Windows\System directory to check your DirectX version and get the newest version of DirectX from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">http://www.microsoft.com/directx</a> if it is needed.<br><br>Please keep an eye on the patch message for further information regarding the planned implementation of DX7.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br>October 13th, 7:00pm<br>------------------------------<br><br><b>*Epic Quests*</b><br><br>Due to some difficulties regarding the Epic Quests implemented two patches ago, the epic quests for the Monk, Wizard, and Druid will not be completable until the next patch.  While we would like to have implemented updates right away for these issues, we are mid-way in our conversion to support the DirectX changes that have been announced. <br><br>We appreciate your patience.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

New posts to the thread were either additional personal attacks or complaints about the personal attacks. Though that might not have been the original subject of the thread, that's what it turned in to and why it was deleted. <br><br>I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time sending individual posts to the moderator for cleaning. If a thread seems to attract more offending posts than proper ones, we'll just delete the whole thread.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023723.html"><b>Halting a Spell</b></a><br>While I've never heard of a 2 second pause being insufficient, I have seen this effect before and imagine that it has something to do with the way prediction is implemented. The client and server do not send position data constantly while you are running, but instead update position data either at a regular interval, or when something significant changes. Basically, the server thinks you are still moving even though from your point of view you are stopped. <br><br>The trick here is to be sure that the server receives the "I stopped" packet before it gets the "I started casting" packet. The best way around this I've found is to turn slightly upon stopping. I always had a much easier time of getting my spells off once I started doing that. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023592.html"><b>Spellcasting Bug</b></a><br>This has happened a few times in the past, and is caused by a network problem on our end. It's a fairly quick fix not requiring server downtime. We apologize for the problem.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023700.html"><b>Working as Intended</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It procs a dmg absorption shield and Berserker Strength. When the shield is used up, the Strength componenet is still active.]</i></font> <br><br>You might want to take another look. The berserker strength spell does include a "skin", however the strength portion does not remain when the shield is used up. <br><br>That said, we are kicking around the idea of removing that component from the bard songs based on it being a bad combination.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/023721.html"><b>The Wishlist Board</b></a><br>I've posted before on the subject. Though people here read those boards regularly, we'll rarely respond to things on the wishlist board. Wishes, by their nature, are things that are unlikely to happen. Responses on that board would typically be along the lines of "I'm sorry but..." or "That's a good idea but..." <br><br>The board would become a negative focus because we would constantly be justifying why wishes either don't fit into EQ, or are good but not something that we are likely to implement. Right now those boards are a good idea resource, but I fear that they would degenerate if we were over there responding to posts regularly.</UL>

The following information was sent in by Ilboris:<BLOCKQUOTE>This is an open invitation to create a Xegony Guild Council for all guilds on <br>xegony. All are welcomed. The idea is borrowed from the similiar Karana Guild <br>Council on Karana Server which works very well. <br><br>The main idea is to have bi-weekly meetings to discuss all things that <br>concern us, to set up and schedule hunts, events, and raids and voting for <br>anything needed to be voted on for all those who wish to join this. A <br>different guild gets to host the meetings every 2 weeks. Hopefully someone <br>can create a web site for use with the Council's own message board for the <br>members but that will come later. <br><br>If you are interested in such a undertaking please ask your guild leader and <br>a guest to come to the Arena zone in Lake Rathetear on October 21 at 9 PM <br>Eastern Time. This is open to all guilds big and small. Everquest staff is <br>also welcomed to attend.<br><br>I hope to see everyone who is interested there next Saturday. <br><br>Ilboris<br>Legacy of Lycanthropes<br>Xegony Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.
