</FONT><HR>Oggok<P>In Oggok there is a guard standing by the back wall. If you attack him, for some reason he runs all over the arena but never at you. So enjoy =) A possible add on would be to try pulling other mobs there. And HEY! If you die in the arena, no biggie, no EXP loss =)<P>South Qeynos<P>If you can get on the roof of the Bag N’ Barrel, you can attack anything down there.  Nothing will run or move to attack you.  Even the NPC’s near it won’t have anything to do about it.  <P>In Qeynos there is a tree beside the mages guild house. You can levitate UP ontop of that tree and from that vantage point NUKE those nasty casters!!!! <P><BR>West Freeport<P>There is a place neaar a merchant called Linadian where you can climb up on the big wall and get the guards.  You must have leviate to execute this one.  Once you climbed up you can blast any body there.  The Gm’s may have fixed this already. I saw a gnome do this.  The wall is in the center of this little court between Linadian and the execution place/reckage.  I will try to get the exact coordinates in a little while<P>1) 	I have been told about a grouping bug.  This bug allows a 7th member to join your group.  This 7th member won’t be able to talk in the group but I’m told that he will able to read what the other member in the group say.  This 7th member will not sure up on the grouping list. Also this 7th member will gain exp as if he were in the group.  I have no tried this bug so I can’t verify that it works but here it goes:<P>	If you have 6 people in a group have one of them disband and then reinvite him,…then invite the 7th person and have them join in a certain order (not sure what order so you might have to play around with this one).  This bug was submitted by a member of my website and he himself said that he was in a group with 7 people because at one point the 7th person went link dead and it told the group the he went linkdead.  <P><BR>2)	This next bug was discovered by someone playing around with another bug I posted earlier..this was the bug:<P>Fast Experience:<P>If your around 12th-15th level there ia a NPC in West Freeport in the bottom of the inn by the gate.  Her name is Trissa Whistlesong and she can take you to about 18th level with pretty steady experience.<P><BR>	Apparently there is a pathing problem inside the inn.  If you move between the corner tables she will take a route around the outside of the room to get to you.  If you move to one table, then cast, then move back to the other corner, and cast you should be able to exploit this bug and kill her without being hit.  Try using this bug to pull other things into the inn as well and follow the steps outlined here.<P><BR>3)	The next bug was submitted by a member of my website as well.  It deals with being able to save no-rent items (items that will normally dissappear after you log out of the game such as summoned bandages, summoned water, some keys that are droped in najena, ect…)<P>Here’s how to do it.  All you apparently have to do is turn off your computer while you are zoning and the no-rent items will be in your inventory when you log back on the next time.<P>Creatures with Most Loot!<P>Level you should be	Loot	Zone	Creature<BR>			<BR>8-12	up to 4 Giant Snake Fangs or poison sacs, which sell for about 4gp 4sp each 	Black Burrow  (2nd level) 	Giant snakes<BR>9	Greater Light Stones  (3.5 plat each)  Lightstones (8 gold each)	Erud’s crossing + west commons	Willowisps<BR>9-14	Purity Belts (1-3 plat each)	Sister Island (1st stop leaving from Freeport	Sister’s of Erollisi<BR>9-16	Bronze weapons (1-4 plat each)  Insignia rings (1-2 gold each)	North Desert Ro	Dervish Cutthroats<BR>12-16	Up to 7 gold in loot	Lesser Fay	Cognoggin <BR>12-15	Up to 4 gold  Bloodstones (4 gold)	Lavastorm	Drakes<BR>12-16	Mandolin (12 gold each)  Up to 4 gold	West Karana	Misty Storyswapper <BR>12-16	Mandolin (12 gold each)  Words (1 plat each)	West Freeport Inn	Trisha Whistlesong <BR>16-22	Up to 2 plat  Bronze weapons (1-4 plat each)  Words (1 plat each)	Lake Rathe	Aviark Guards<BR>16-21	Fine Steel Weapons (2-5 plat each)	South Ro	Dry Bone Skeletons<BR>16-20	Not sure of exact loot but you can earn about 20 plat an hour	West Karana	Ghouls, Skeletons, and Zombies <BR>18-24	Raw-hide armor (about 7 gold each)  Up to 2.5 plat	North Karana	Cordelia Minster <BR>18-21	Gargoyle eye (9 plat each) (dropped 25% of the time)  	Ocean of Tears	Gargoyles<BR>18-24	Quest component (once quest is completed for the Grobb cleaver it can be sold for between 150-400 plat)	Ocean of Tears	Nerbilik<BR>18-24	Warclub (5 plat each)  Up to 1 plat	Neriak Third Gate	Ratraz<BR>18-26	Fine steel weapons (2-5 plat)  Up to 3-10 gold  Low-value gems	Lake Rathe	Various undead<BR>20-26	Up to 2 plat  Flesh orb (quest item)	West Karana	Limpeck Hargrim <BR>20-23	Terrors drop up to 3 or 4 plat as well as gems and   Tentacle Whip (around 15-20 plat) 	Najena	Tentacle Terrors<BR>20-31	Up to 5 plat  Great Staff (worth 15 plat)	South Karana (loc 1500,-3500) 	Trents<BR>20-25	They drop up to 3 plat, mostly less than one, medium chainmail pieces, occasional research components (Words, Grimoires, and Runes...) and rusty or bronze weapons (if you see them wielding them).

You need to stand at loc 1938,-343..Kill Clockwork XXVIIIB<BR>The trick here is that when standing at this loc Clockwork XXVIIIB won’t move and you can keep blasting it<P>Cheat #2<P>Go to loc 1470,-558 Your target here is Guide II at this loc you will again be able to blast Guide II and it won’t come after you<P><BR>High Keep<P>Cheat #3<P>As you enter High Keep you will see a guard Rance and Guard Duras.  You’ll see a cliff ledge on your right.  You need to go up there by heading to the 4rth floor in the high keep castle and then jumping down there.  You’ll have to keep trying this until you figure it out.  Get to loc -92,20 and you will be able to blast whatever is down there and they won’t be able to get to you.<P>Cheat #4<P>If you are a lower level this on is great for you.  You can lure prisoners in the jail and then run to the princess’s room and get up against the wall behind her..this makes it so the mobs won’t follow you<P><BR>Cheat #5<P>In the pickclaw area, in the lookout room you can get mobs trapped against the back wall.  All you have to do is pull the monsters forward and then run back to the left or right corner and the monsters will stick<P><BR>Freeport<P>Cheat #6<P>Go to the Monk guild house in West Freeport.  There will be a storage like building at the corner against the Monk guild house.  Get on the 2nd floor and stand at loc -38.66,-654 You’ll be able to blast anything down there and they won’t come up to get you<P><BR>Lower guk<P><BR>Cheat #7<P>You need to go to the mino elder room.  If you stand right where the room starts to widen up coming from the evil eye/live side zone area you can blast mobs and they’ll get stuck in a loop and can’t follow.  You can use this bug to lure any creature you want and they will get stuck here. I’ve seen people do this with the assassin. You’ll just have to experiement with this one.<P><BR>Mistmore<P><BR>Cheat #8<P>Get by the bridge into the castle and get levitate.  You’ll want to float across to the ledge to your left.  You can get to the top of the building and blast monsters from there without them attacking you.<P><BR>Lesser Fay<P><BR>Cheat #9<P>There is a small undead camp near the sisters camp in lesser fay.  You’ll notice when you go there that if you blast or attack on of the undead if you back up to a certain distance from the camp aftering atacking them they will run away from you.  They are in fact taking a different route to get to you..a long loop around.  You can move forward to get them to come back to you.  The object here is to blast..back up and make them run…wait a sec…move forward again and blast.  This makes it so that you will never get hit.  You just keep making them run from and away from you while you blast them	<P>Powerleveling Walk-Through Guide<P><BR>The general rule is that if you are a pure caster you will be able to solo effectively all the way to 50th level.  This is very true for magicians and necromancers.  If you are a melee class then you will need to group…Preferable with a healer type to get to 50th level.<BR>Also, if you are a pure caster you should be able to take blues and blacks fairly consistently..as a melee class you should only attempt blues solo.  Remember the worst thing you can do is die because you will not only lose experience but you will lose the time to get back to your corpse (you could have been killing that whole time) and you’ll take the chance of dying again while you get back to your corpse.<BR>Another piece of advice is not to worry about your gear.  As you level better items will become available to you.  Most people spend serious amounts of time and money on better getting better gear.  Although this will help you level slightly faster the time you spend trying to get the gear you could be fighting things.<P>Ask high level players for there powerful buffs..it can’t hurt but don’t waste your time trying to get them. If a high level character is near you see if he will give you a buff or two…it might even be worth giving him some money for it<P>If you are a melee class a trick is to sit by the gates of some city and ask for buffs. A lot of high level people pass through this area. In other zones they are less likely to buff you because chances are you wont be near them and it’s too much of a hassle for them to buff you and you usually can’t go to them because they are in dangerous areas.<P>If you are a caster focus on getting the buffs Clarity and SOW.  Clarity will boost your mana regeneration (like 3 times the speed of regeneration) and SOW will allow you to Kite (cast spells on a creature, run to a safe distance, cast on the creature again and repeat the process until the creature is very low on hp or dead)<BR>As a caster generally buffs aren’t your concern so get directly to fight<P>The key is repetition. Kill, kill and kill again and never die.  Stock up on food/water and hit the killing spots I will talk about below.<P>Fast Leveling Guide arranged by level:<P>Levels 1-5<P>Well since you are a newbie you won’t really be leaving the area closest to a city…All you need is here and getting to 5th level shouldn’t be much problem.  Remember to fight everything to the death…never run because you will lose nothing (there’s no experience loss at these levels).  Once you hit 5th you’ll need to use my other tips.<P>Levels 5-12<P>Freeport area:<P>This is one of the best places to powerlevel in my experience. I have found that East Commonlands is the best place to do this.  There is a nice progression of creatures in this zone with guards and inns everywhere.  Evil races might have a bit of a problem trying to use the venders here because they don’t like evil races.  Just make shout outs to get someone to buy you food and water and maybe sell off your items.  Remember to zone or run to guard if you get into trouble. Beware of the snakes here though.  Some are poisonous which is fairly deadly (it will suck about 1-2 bubbles out of you).<P>Try staying close to the east common/desert ro cave entrance located at -1050,860. That way you can try to make it to the zone if you get into trouble.  <P>There is also a lvl 9 female dark elf (6 minute spawn at -285,-450) in east freeport.  You’ll take a big faction hit with the East/West Freeport guards but this is a good spot for exp. for evil races.<P>Butcher Block Area:<P>At level 5 this is another great place to get some fast leveling.  Kill large snakes and goblin’s near the Crossroads.  There are 2 and sometimes 3 guards there so you will be protected.  Once you get to level 8 or 9 I recommend heading over to east commons near freeport. <P><BR>If you choose to stay in butcher block head over to chessboard located at 890, -2690 when you reach about 9th level. There are a few large skeletons that spawn here.  They are spaced enough apart that you can lure one at a time in battle.  They hit hard so if you are a caster use a pet, root, or snare them (run and blast).  Try your hand in this area because you can remain here for a few levels.<P>North Ro Area<P>At level 10-11 you can also go to North Ro to fight derv’s.  Since these are derv camps they will train on you so either make sure there are enough people here to help or you are in a group.  There are derv camps at there locs:<P>1450,-375<BR>220,360<BR>-1125,1250<BR>40,375<P>Steamfont Area:<P>Another choice is to go to Steamfont.  Head over to the mino cave at loc 1250,-1850 once you hit levels 8-12.  Stand in front of the mino cave and look out from the cave.  You should be able to see something that looks like a big sprocket sticking up from the ground.  Go over there being careful not to get to close to any monster.  Once close to the sproket look over to your left and you will see a hill.  Go to the top of this hill.  There will be a flat area where you can lure monsters up to and fight them.  Fighting here will get you to 12th level fairly quickly.<P>Greater Fay/Crushbone Area<P>Another great place to get from about 6-9th level is the orc camp near crushbone in greater fay.  Here are useful loc’s when fighting here:<P>					Orc camp 1750,-150	(good for levels 6-8)<BR>					Orc hill 1856,-100	(good for levels 8-9)<BR>Orc lift 1000,225	(takes you up to kelethin and the path near it takes you to the orcs)<P>If you get into trouble there are guards at the orc lift that will protect you.  The orcs will train on you if you get too close to them, but there are numerous spots where you can fighting one at a time.  Only the orc shaman casts spells so they are pure melee fighters.  Another great thing about them is they drop weapons and cloth armor which sells for 1 silver to 1 plat each.<P><BR>Levels 12-20<P>Oasis of Marr Area<P>Alright now that you are 12th level I recommend heading over to Oasis of Marr.  Stay along the beach area here and start killing caimans.  They will con blue black and yellow to you at 12th level.  There are some dangers around this area.  Sand Giants will roam around as well as some Spectres that high level people have lured.  Here are some important loc’s for this zone:<P>					Inn				-1270,-300<BR>					Zone to South Ro		-1850,0<BR>					Zone to North Desert Ro	2500,0<BR>					Orc Temple			1200,1125<P>Orcs can be another target to gain fast experience as well.  Becareful because they tend to train on people.<P>West Freeport Area<P>There is a bard named Trissa Whistlesong (6 minute spawn) at loc -110,-430 in west freeport.  She is 15th level but her hit points are only 280.<BR>Casters can take her at 12th level and clerics, shaman, or druids should be able to take her at 14th level.  Feel free to kite her because the guards will now protect her or attack you.<P>East Karana Area<P>There is a Human Warrior named Milea Clothspi (6 minute spawn) at loc -1800,-6075. She is located near the entrance to High Pass.  This is another great person to camp and kill.<P>Levels 20-25<P><BR>Lake Rathe Area<P>Two words Lake Rathe.  The aviarks here are great to keep beating on.  You probably have heard a lot about the aviak towers here. Use the maps included to find the aviark towers (aviarks are about 16-20th level). Also becareful of Webclaw (he’s a slightly higher level goblin that roams this zone every once in a while.  The aviarks are in groups here so if you attack one of them then all will come.  Soothe is a great spell to take these camps.  You might consider grouping here or taking one or 2 while other people take the others. Here are some important locs:<P>					Aviark guards			2473,-2479<BR>			2335,2472<BR>					Zone to rathe mountains	2600,-2350<BR>					Zone to south karana		3800,1200<P><BR>Akanon Area<P>A favorite kill of mine is an NPC located in akanon in steamfont zone.  It is a single spawn (6 minute spawn) at loc 2335,2472.  This mechanic NPC (about 22nd level) has low hit points (370-450) and only max hits for 36 and has great loot.<P>Oasis of Marr Area<P>If you want to go back to or stay in Oasis of marr at 20th level you can begin to fight caimans, crocodiles, deepwater caimans and deepwater crocodiles until you reach 24th level.  The great thing here is that they don’t train on you if you’re fighting one of them.<P>Ocean of Tears Area<P>On the sister island in Ocean of Tears there is a level 24 female dwarf bandit named Elona Tunbrin (6 minute spawn)(740 hit points) at loc 1365,-10000.  Dwarf bandits have one of the best experience gains for their levels.<P>Levels 25-35<P><BR>Akanon Area<P>There is a wood elf named Lyra Lyrestringer (6 minute spawn) at loc 1250,-750.  She is about 25th level and a great kill if you are not KOS in Akanon.<P>Ocean of Tears<P>There are 2 more dwarfs on the sister island in Ocean of Tears that you can target.  <P>				Hugan Tunbrin  		400,-10170<BR>				Glendl Vargnus  		1250,-9220<P>They are both 25th level with about 810 hit points each and they can be pulled one at a time.  Once your level goes up a bit you’ll be killing them faster than the spawn rate. The problem here is that you will take a faction hit in the butcherblock port so remember that when you take the boat back jump off the boat just before it ports and swim in.<P>South Karana Area<P>At this level you’ll need to hit the Aviark Village in South Karana.  There are different levels of aviarks here so you can go quite a few levels here in no time at all.  You should group for this area though because it can be dangerous will train.  There are usually a lot of people here which is good and bad.  Finding a group wont be a problem but you’ll have to split the kills with other groups.  The zone is probably too far away to get to if things get bad so becareful at this location.<P>				Aviark Village		-6700,1200<P><BR>I am told that there is a hermit in this zone, which is also very good experience and good loot.  <P>Hermit			 -5500, -2780<P><BR>The hermit is inside a house.  What you do is go to the wall on the outside of the house and say “I am here to kill you” He will then come out of the house and start attacking you.  The spawn rate is about 3-4 minutes so that’s a lot of potential experience for you.  At level 27 the hermit becomes green.<P>South Karana Area<P>Here is another great person to fight for fast experience in South Karana.<P>					Tesch Mas		-3200, 800 <P><BR>The levels are 25-27.  They are aggro and do train but this is a great place for experience.  Don’t go inside Slitpaw because of the train dangers. Remember the goal is to never die..that wastes too much time (you can gain about 1 bubble of exp. with the time it takes you to get back to where you were)<P><BR>South Karana Area<P>Another NPC to fight in South Karana is a bard.  He is 31st level (6 minute spawn)(1171 hit points).  It doesn’t cast so a good way to attack him is by kiting.<P>					Vhalen Nostrolo		 -60, -230<P>Levels 35-40<P>Now this is where it gets hard.  You’ve reached the hell levels.  One reason they call it the hell levels is because there isn’t much you can fight solo left.  For casters it is hard because it gets harder and hard to fight creatures without there next spells.  For melee classes because everything hit hard and casts spells at these levels.  Another hard part is finding creatures to fight that are in safe locations for an easy escape or they have so many underlings with them that you can take them all.  Well let me point out some locations that are good for hunting at these levels.<P>Steamfont Area<P>Gnome watchmans are the target.  There are 5 of them all level 35 with about 1675 hit points (6 minute spawns).  The locs are:<P>				Watchman Mylz		-100,-400<BR>				Watchman Halv		-830,555<BR>				Watchman Dreeb		-1385,555<BR>				Watchman Prenn		-1850,550<BR>				Watchman Prynn		-1835,565<P>Butcher Block Area<P>Dwarf bandits are the targets here.  There are plenty (4) on them in butcher block for you to level quickly. They are all level 35 with about 1675 hit points each.  The locs are:<P>				Den Ironblend			-1500,2850<BR>				Dalbar Tarbrind		-1400,2880<BR>				Lann Dalbrin			-1400,2895<BR>				Tagnis Ginfarr			-1515,2975<P>Feerrott Area<P>There is a single spectre cave near the southeast corner of feerrott. There is a hidden cave down there and just about 10 steps ahead of the cave there is a single spectre under a tree that you can pull solo.  Casters should be able to kill it at 39th level solo.  Melee and hybrids may need to be 40-41st level. Clerics are the best here because of their cool undead spells.<P>Levels 40-50<P>Oggok Area<P>There are 2 gre guards at the front of the Ogre city entrance.  They have pretty tough resistances but at your level you can’t be picky.  They are 37th level with 1675 hit points each.  The locs are:<P>					Bouncer Fug		1460,875<BR>					Bouncer Prud		1466,930<P>East Freeport Area<P>There are 2 guards at the East gate entrance.  They are 37th level and I recommend kiting them.  The locs are:<P>					Guard Topplo		-350,-675<BR>					Guard Sheg		-353,-700<P>You can also kill a guard next to the west freeport zone.<P>					Guard Zontrin		383,-310<P>North Freeport Area<P>There is a monk named Reyia Beslin just outside the monk guild in north freeport.  The monk is 39th level with about 2850 hit points.  You will receive a faction hit with the north freeport guards.  If you want to go back to that bank at some point you’ll need to invis and click on the banker behind his back.<P>					Reyia Beslin		-185,-830<P><BR>Uncovering the Secret “No Drop Bug”<P><BR>Alright..you may have heard that there is a bug that will let you turn “no-drop” items into “lore” items so that you can sell the item and trade it with other characters.  After a bit of digging I have found the way people are doing this.  It is a bit dangerous and would not recommend people doing this…it could get you suspended from Everquest..but here it is:<P><BR>You’ll need a hacking program for this. Go to www.malinverni.com  and download the freeware winhack program.  You’ll need to run this program while playing Everquest (I’ve heard that you can play Everquest in a window just like Ultima Online but if anyone knows how to do this please contact me craigba@psn.net)<P>I’ve heard it is best that you rename the winhack program to something else because Verant has programs that detect hacking software that is running while people are playing Everquest.  By renaming it you may avoid this but I’m not sure.<P>When you have the program running it will list items and other things as well.  You want to find particular items that are no-drop….they will have a number code next to them “00” is the code.  What you want to do is change this code to “01” and the item will become lore instead of no-drop.<P>For my own safety I do not recommend using this bug.  If you get caught you’ll probably get suspended from Everquest (and possibily worse..lose your account).  I have never used hacking programs because it is too risky and I don’t want my accounts closed.  You have been warned.<P>New Bug:<P>	In Eurdin there is a spawn named Tol Nicelot.  He drops about 5-8 plat per kill.  I believe he is about 20th level.  You can pull him to the teleport to Tox Forest..make sure he follows you to the teleport so he will be in range and take the Teleport too.  When you take the teleport stand behind the teleport going back to the city and blast away.  You should be able he hit him and he will be very vunerable.  This technique can be used on the guards as well.<P><BR>Fast Experience:<P>If your around 12th-15th level there ia a NPC in West Freeport in the bottom of the inn by the gate.  Her name is Trissa Whistlesong and she can take you to about 18th level with pretty steady experience.<P>More Updates to come...<P>Hope everyone likes it..... blah! <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002471.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Stuff+on+EQ+i|APO|ve+found+on+the+net..">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">
