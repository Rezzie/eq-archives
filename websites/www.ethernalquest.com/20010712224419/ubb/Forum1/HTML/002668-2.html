</FONT><HR>Holy Christ on a Crutch.  I really can't believe the utter nonsense that's being put forth in this thread...<P>I'll start with Midnight Essence, at least he has proven himself capable of carrying on an intelligent arguement, however misguided it may be.<P>(I really wish the quote feature was turned on, on this UBB)<P>As i stated in a former post, when you judge another, you will find yourself to be judged. You question how others might type or write, the specifics are irrelevant, needless to say everyone else has the right to question how you might type or write as they see fit. What goes around, sometimes comes back around, tenfold. "<P>When did I say, in my posts, that I was above judgement?  If you choose to judge me, that's fine, and it makes very little difference to me.  _I_ am secure in the way I communicate and type.  My writing (and in my opinion, your own) are well within the limits of acceptablility, others are not.  Yes, I will judge others against my own standards.  You must be at least this tall to ride this ride, thank you.<P>As a quick aside to this part of the post, I'd like you all to step back a moment and examine the messages posted in this thread by certain people against messages posted in other threads by the same people.  You'll find a few select individuals have OBVIOUSLY taken more time to write their messages and appear coherent and educated than they normally do.  If it's so all-fired unimportant how you communicate, then why have they done this?<P>"This is known as an 'IKYABWAI'. If you don't understand it's meaning, then obviously, i have overestimated your ability to understand the concept involved."<P>This has nothing to do with IKYABWAI, you have very little substance in your responses, just mainly fluff.  Also, if you had bothered to READ what I posted, not what you _THINK_ I meant, you'll noticed I put that out as a conjecture, I did not say that is what you were doing.  I gave you several options as to what I beleive you are doing.  You must also comprehend what I am typing before responding to me.<P>"If you choose to judge another on grammar and spelling, then another will have every right to judge *you* on grammar and spelling. With that being said, my comments were hardly irrelevant, given the fact that this thread is *not* exclusive to any particular grammar or spelling error. If you believe that your dislikes entail the entirety of the 'relevant' portions of this thread, then you are even more narrow-minded than your replies already suggest."<P>Here we go again with the judgements.  Again, this has absolutely nothing to do with my arguement, yet you are picking it out and writing long paragraphs about it.  This supports my earlier thought that you may be just picking on the easy targets, as opposed to the hard ones.<P>"It just proves to illustrate how ignorant you truly are. This forum is *casual*. Essentially this means they will be typing on their own time. They do *not* receive a complementary, automated email from Ashran stating how well executed the grammar on their most recent post was. They do *not* get paid to beautify their post, and they do *not* owe you respect by taking an extra .3 of a second to type out a word. As a society, we are constantly striving for convenience, it is natural that this will seep into the way we communicate, be that written or verbal."<P>Exactly how many times are you going say the same thing slightly revised?  If they do not owe me respect, as the writer, why do I owe them respect as the reader?  By being too lazy to type "you" instead of "u", I'm obviously not worth the time to communicate with me in an intelligent manner.  Fine, the message is not worth my time to read.  However, it is, obviously, my time, and because of that, it IS worth my time to point out the fact that they look like immature morons for using "u" instead of "you" etc...<P>You talk about society constantly striving for convenience... What on earth does this have to do with it?  When you are writing something on a forum, such as this one, you expect it to be read by another.  As such, it's your duty to write in a manner that is intelligent and understandable.  <P>I find it sad you should say "...it is natural that this will seep into hte way we communicate, be that written or verbal."<P>How utterly shortsighted this is.  By this very statement, you sum up the American ideal.  "The lowest common demoninator is best." ... I'm sorry, but I do not subscribe to that theory.  I will _NOT_ lower myself to trailer trash 13 year old hick speech, and I will berate and belittle anyone else who thinks its acceptable to strive for the lowest possible point of communication.  What's next?  You want to grunt like a monkey, pointing at things you want while flinging your shit around?  That's exactly what you are advocating, taken to an extreme.  The ability to communicate at high levels is essentially what sets us apart from monkies... keep devolving the language and you may as well swing from trees and drink your own urine.<P>"Again, i'll repeat this from my last few posts. It's all about people getting where they want to go, not how they get there."<P>I'm pretty speechless at this little gem.  Lets extend this to another anology, and see if it holds up...<P>Bob, your next door neighbor, has a nifty new CPU.  You think to yourself, gee, I'd like a CPU like that.  <P>Now, given your analogy, the logical thing to do would be to go over to Bob's house and either steal it, or kill him and take it (I assume he'd try to stop you if you just walked up and took it from him).  Now, is either of those right?  I hope you answer no.  But, you wanted a new CPU, and it's not how you get the new CPU, it's just that you HAVE the new CPU, isn't it?  <P>Yes, that analogy is taken to the extreme, but it's essentially the same.  It's a balance between HOW you get somewhere and getting there at all.  The ends do not justify the means.  A civilized society can not function under that directive.<P>"It is sad that you can find *intent* from an individual, based on the spelling of a word. /sarcasm If this is truly so, then your grammar and spelling errors in my name from a previous post, must be concluded to the fact you hold no respect for me! .. You may say it was an innocent and unintentional error, which i believe, but why couldn't you have taken the small amount of time to reread your post for such errors as to show me, your reader, respect? /sarcasm"<P>Are you not reading a word I'm typing?  Do you not understand?  What is it?  Of course I can find the intent of a writer in what they write and how they write it.<P>Let me give you another example (which I seem to have to do a lot):<P>sow plzthx<P>or <P>Could I trouble you for a SoW, please?<P>Which one are you more likely to respond to?  The first person obviously doesn't much care that you are doing them a favor, they just want the goods (in this case, a SoW), the second person obviously realizes that you ARE doing them a favor and would most likely be grateful for the assistance.  There is a chance this is not the case, of course, but on average, the person who takes the time to type the second sentence obviously respects the fact that you are doing a favor for them, whereas the first person most likely does not.  You are obviously not worth the time to type out the whole sentence.<P>"A reader *can* show respect by the way he will write, but a lack of grammar and spelling could hardly be attributed to the idea that the individual holds no respect for the reader at all. Language is merely a form of conveyance for an idea, it is the idea itself which holds the most importance."<P>Are you trying to tell me that,<P>"u have any plat or no ne1 that has some pp they can give me?"<P>is just as respectful as<P>"Pardon me, I'm kind of broke due to losing my corpse, could you spare any plat, or know anyone who might?"<P>Like hell... if you try to say the first one is just as respectful as the second, you are smoking crack.  The conveyence of the idea is as important as the idea itself, ESPECIALLY in a casual setting.  (In an emergency setting, the conveyence of fast information is of a higher priority, and consequently the medium and method take a very low priority.  To use EQ as an example, /shout u need to move train coming! would be acceptable, in a casual setting it IS NOT)<P>"It seems you are arrogant enough to *hint* towards an implication that you are the only person capable of helping such people. Let me wave a magic wand and quietly dismiss that. There are undoubtedly others who will assist in answering persistent questions should you be absent, and the affect to any one life will be minimal. <BR>However, let us indulge your delusion for a moment, and grant you the benefit of the doubt. If you do not post here very often any longer, then OMFG! .. The lives you have destroyed! .. The marriages you have ended! .. The families you have separated! .. the carnage .. *shudder*.. the chaos *weep* is .. is .. "<P>Aparently, even though I spelled it out for you, I was being sarcastic... you seemed to hve missed the entire segment where I stated this.  I won't go into the rest of your meaningless paragraph, because it's based on fiction and your ignorance of the type of questions that are commonly posted over in the SEQ forums, apparently.<P>Oh: "Is simply *not* within your limited control."<P>Actually... it is.  I'll leave you to discover why this is so.<P>"'Let he who is without sin, cast the first stone' - Heard of this? .. I'm willing to bet you have. It generally means, if you are perfect and without fault, you may pass the first judgement upon another without consequence. "<P>Perfect? No... but I _AM_ "more" perfect than the white trash trailer denizens that this whole thread is about.<P>Conceited?  Maybe, but at least I can communicate my arrogence in a manner that most people can understand, unlike the aforementioned white trash trailer denizens.<P>Let me move onto Icon, the super-stud:<P>"I also think that shortcuts like that are simply like saying "Wanna go kill somethin?" instead of "Hey, would you like to go and kill something?" They are more of a personal thing then some type of insult."<P>Dude... do you read at all?  If you do, do you comprehend what's being said in this thread?  This thread has nothing to do with "Hey, wanna go kill something", and has everything to do with "u", "ur", "plz", "thx", "b4", "ne1", and I think that about covers it.<P>"Sup" is a speech particle that can be used to show how you would be talking if you were face to face, just like "somethin'" and other shortened words.<P>In the case of "u", "ur", "plz", "thx", "b4" and "ne1", these are lazy words.  "you" and "u" sound EXACTLY the same (or, that is to say, they are intended to sound exactly the same".  "ur" and "your" are supposed to sound the same.  "plz" is suppose to sound like Please, but you would not say "pl-zzz" in real life in place of Please, nor would you say "thux" in real life in place of Thanks.  "b4" and "ne1" sound like their counterparts.  These "words" are not the same as "somethin', sup, wassup, gonna, wanna, gimme" etc...  If you were speaking, you would actually say "gimme, wanna, somethin'" or even "sup" ...<P>THAT is the fundamental difference you appear to have missed in this ENTIRE 2 FRIGGING PAGE THREAD.  Here's a quarter, now go buy a clue.<P>Abbreviations to abbreviate multi word phrases are acceptable... but shortening a word from 3 letters to 1 is totally ridiculous and makes you look ignorant.<P>"As you can see, my point is that much of the 'bad grammer' you are against can be construed as abbreviations instead of lazyness. You said you didn't like Thx or Plz... how is that much different from lol?"<P>No, I can't see your point, because your point was totally lost in your rambling that have nothing to do with the reality of this thread.  "lol" is an abbreviation of Laughing Out Loud, that is 17 characters abbreviated into 3, whereas Thanks is 6 characters abbreviated into 3, while at the same time telling the recipient that they are not worth enough of your time to type 3 more characters on their keyboard.  If you don't understand the difference between the two, you have no business posting here.<P>Abbreviations ARE laziness.  There's an acceptable limit to it.  For Mr. Esseneces' benefit, no, I am not above reasonable abbreviations such as lol, rofl, mob, afk, brb.  As I said, there ARE acceptable limits, but "plz", "thx" etc... is WAYYY below that line, especially when dealing with actions usually involving someone doing something for someone else.<P>Projetile:  Do you have anything meaningful to say, or do you enjoy the mental masturbation sensation you get from posting something with absolutely no content what so ever?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002668.cgi&ReplyNum=000044&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=The+Grammar+Thread">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

It is sometimes the person who will speak his opinion softly and walk away, who will make the greatest of impacts.<P>I will not waste my time on an argument that is clearly treading the very same ground, over and over. You have stated your opinion, I have stated mine. Simple.<P>The only person that we disrespect with these persistent 'edit, snip, edit' replies, is the reader.

He is basically saying "Let's agree to disagree."<P>Therefore, I will also stop posting to this topic, and if you really wish to cuddle this debate to your chest like a child's teddy bear, you may E-Mail me at Icon@icon187.virtualave.net<BR>I will not waste everyone else's time any longer with this boring thread.<P>PS - adenine!

</FONT><HR>Obviously you cannot end this debate gracefully, so now I ask Ashran or some other moderator to please lock this thread. Ratt feels that anyone who disagree's with his opinion cannot come up with a valid reason.  Yet I have come up with plenty while he simply attacks my person instead of my reasoning to cover up his lack of supporting 'evidence'.  I hate to use that word, however, because this topic doesn't just 'boil down to' opinion, it is completely &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; opinion.<BR>Therefore, in a situation like this, there is no such thing as evidence. It is all reasoning behind our opinions.<BR>I have gotten off topic.  I will &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; further debate this with you via the forum, so if you wish to banter some more, mail me.<P>Anyway, Ashran, &lt;b&gt;please&lt;/b&gt; close this topic!<P>Plz?

So is Hawaii, Alaska, etc, and they are abbreviated to 2 letters so what's so bad about 'plz'?<P>It's not disrespect when people type, "Can I have a sow plz?"  And if you take it as disrespect, then God have mercy on you.  <P>Most people who use the term 'plz' and 'thx' don't go around saying "sow plz thx".  If they do, just dont respond.

</FONT><HR>i'm really bored and figure this damn thread needs to hit 3 pages!<P>everyone's "evidence" as stated previously by more than one person is really opinion.  its all personal preference.  thats it.  mine included!<P>sure, it sucks when you are playing everquest... and you happen to go into a city where the lvl 10's hang out begging for sow... but who really cares, ignore them.<P>the problem with any debate is the slippery slope.  sure, you say that plz and thx make you look supid, but where does that stop?  do i look stupid for using contractions... which are really abbreviations ment to save time?  do you look stupid when your write that you live in "atlanta, ga"?<P>looking at everquest only example, plz and thx... you have to look at all of the abreviations.  we have WTB, WTS, WTT, LFG, MOB, INC and who knows what else (since i'm not logged in now).  i bet at some point you have told your group (maybe in a fit of panic at accidentally agro'ing something) "inc!" but how many letters did you save?  5.  we all know that WTB saves a lot of typing... Want To Buy is 6 letters in savings!<P>for ANY arguement on ANY side of the debate there is a counterpoint.  a very good one is the state names one that (yeah, i don't have another browser open) someone brought up.  Georgia is only 7 letters long, and is abbreviated to GA.  if someone askes me, i don't have any problem with saying "atlanta, ga" or even "atl, ga" (atl being the abbreviation used by the airport as well as being pretty popular i think)<P>what about people who speak other languages?  if i made the EXACT same arguement as you, but in GERMAN... i could say "oh, you can't use correct german grammer/spelling/abbreviations, so you are stupid"<P>hell, what about can't and can not... and all the other contractions?  you think they were invented by some english professor?  they are (well, i could easily be wrong) words that were probably shortened by the people that didn't like saying/writing/typing them all the time.  yeah, you shortened a 6 letter word (can not) to 4/5 (if you count the ').  what the hell is up with that?  thats only 1 or 2 letters in savings?  i bet back when ever this came around, there was some dude scribbling on public buildings about how anyone who used it would look stupid in the eyes of the educated.<P>you say you will accept it when it is in major news papers... have you ever taken a look at the fucking classifieds???  i mean SHIT, it takes me forever to figure out what some of THOSE abbreviations are...  does the new york times have classifieds?  at least plz and thx sound like the real word they are trying to replace.<P>does it really make people look stupid?  does not having the entire english language (structure) rules memorized make you stupid?  i mean really, think about the english language... what are the rules for?  to make it easier to read.  i should be capitolizing the first letter of every sentence, because it makes it easier for you to read.  all the little rules of the english language are (for the most part) there to standardize text and make it readable.<P>ask yourself how you speak as well.  imagine you don't know english... imagine someone just taught you the alphabet, and you are very proud of yourself for learning it.  now spell the word "you" like it sounds... what do you type/write?  if you type "you" i'd call you a fucking cheater.  if you typed/wrote "u" i'd say "wow, you have mastered the alphabet, now lets work on spelling"<P>next, lets perhaps do some math.  perhaps listing a few of these stupid abbreviations and the letters they save. please=plz=3,thanks=thx=4,anyone=ne1=3,you=u=2,thank you=ty=8(9 if you count the space).  there, that is a few.  IF you are a newbie begger, saying "plz, ne1 sow me, thx" and "u got ne pp? thx" every 30seconds... (saving 17 letters total (i think)) over a 5min time period you have saved yourself typing 170 letters.<P>well, this god damn post is pretty long i hope... and hard to read (cause i suck at writing papers and stuff) and hopefully its mostly stream of conciousness (sp?) &lt;- oh no, isn't that an abbreviation that english teachers use!<P>damn, my spelling/grammer/english abilitys are about on par with a 6 year old so i must be st00pid :(<P>anyway, i forgot to mention that i (hopefully like Ratt) can't fucking stand people who beg with plz/thx because they can't take the time to type out please and thank you.  more than likly, u won't get dick out of me if you can't ask me nicely.  i differ however in that i don't just assume these people are st00pid.  my judgement is that they are no good 13 year olds that just want a free ride.  it rarely extends outside of everquest, because on these forums, the people with REAL showeq problems usually don't use plz and thx.  i will help ANYONE that asks a question that i feel i can help with.  i don't just turn away and say "oh, well... he didn't respect me as a reader because he used "u" instead of "you".  if the person took the time to post his problem (and it isn't just a simple one liner like "WTF, showeq doesn't work!") i believe it shows the INTENT to try and help other people solve his problem.  so fucking what if his (good) description of the problem includes a few "u" , "your/you're" , etc... type mistakes.<P>as for the other aspect of most of these posts... why does everyone attack everyone elses spelling and grammer?  i mean really... why not focus on the actual MEAT of the debate?  sure, i could run this shit into word and spell check/grammer check it... but i'm really fucking lazy (hell, i'm so lazy i don't use the shift key!).  i don't THINK i've actually attacked anyones spelling/grammer/whatever in my post (and i hope i haven't) because it really serves no point in a valid argument.  if everyone were perfect at everything, where would the fun be?<p>[This message has been edited by fryfrog (edited 05-17-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002668.cgi&ReplyNum=000061&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=The+Grammar+Thread">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

I'm not an author of novels.  My writing is filled with the information I think is relevent, nothing more.  I'm sorry if it's 'uninteresting', but that doesn't negate the validity of it.<P>Fryfrog:<P>Quite a long dissertation there  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif">  You seemed to have missed a few of my points, or perhaps you were referring to someone else, if so, then forget I mentioned anything.<P>I never said WTB, WTS, WTT, LFG, MOB, INC etc... were unacceptable, in fact, in some of my later posts I stated pretty much all the ones that were unacceptable (ne1, u, plz, ur, thx, plz, etc...)<P>Basically the words that only phonetically (and sometimes superfically) sound like the real word.  Contractions do not fall into this category, and acronyms do not either.  With the exception of INC, the above acronyms are just that, acronyms (WTT, WTB, LFG, etc...), whereas plz, thx, u, ur, etc... are just plain lazy.  They would either NOT sound like the word you are trying to say, if spoken, or they just look plain lazy and ridiculous.  <P>Additionally, I don't know how many times I can restatke this, but I do not harp on peoples occasional spelling or grammatical mistake, far from it.  I make them myself.  But I do _NOT_ use the terms "plz, thx, u, ur, b4, ne1" etc...  I DO use the terms LFG, MOB, I actually type out INCOMING (but that's another story), LFG.  I don't really sell/trade anything so I never use WTT/WTB/WTS.<P>The classifieds of a newspaper don't count.  I'm talking about the articles, written by "professional" writers.<P>As for your German bit, this isn't a primarily German forum, I wouldn't be posting here if it was, as I'm not German.  I also stated, a while back in this thread, that EAASL is exempt, but those individuals should still not be using plz, thx, u, ur, etc...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002668.cgi&ReplyNum=000063&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=The+Grammar+Thread">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to add a couple things here.<P>Ratt:<BR>First of all, in one of your posts, you stated:<BR>"In the case of "u", "ur", "plz", "thx", "b4" and "ne1", these are lazy words. "you" and "u" sound EXACTLY the same (or, that is to say, they are intended to sound exactly the same". "ur" and "your" are supposed to sound the same. "plz" is suppose to sound like Please, but you would not say "pl-zzz" in real life in place of Please, nor would you say "thux" in real life in place of Thanks. "b4" and "ne1" sound like their counterparts. These "words" are not the same as "somethin', sup, wassup, gonna, wanna, gimme" etc... If you were speaking, you would actually say "gimme, wanna, somethin'" or even "sup" ...<P>THAT is the fundamental difference you appear to have missed in this ENTIRE 2 FRIGGING PAGE THREAD. Here's a quarter, now go buy a clue."<P>- No, I didn't miss the difference.  I have already explained why I felt that plz, thx, etc... are acceptable, therefore, I thought I didn't need to explain it again.  So I simply explained another way I think of people who use that form of grammer.<P>I say, "Hey, can I have SoW?"<BR>you give sow<BR>I say "Hey, thx man!"<P>I'm wondering what you find offensive about that scenario? Obviously I'm thanking you for the sow, YOU know what thx means, and the point gets across.  Someone before stated that it's the MEAT of the post/statement that matters, not the way it's presented.  Also, there is a LARGE fundamental difference between that and "The ends justifying the means."  The two are totally different. I'm talking about communication, not life.<P>Also, I'm curious, what did you mean by "Icon, the super-stud"?<P>While I agree that I am probably a super stud, what did that have to do with this thread at all?<P> - Icon<BR>-------------------<BR>In memory of MasTerKeyZ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002668.cgi&ReplyNum=000075&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=The+Grammar+Thread">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002668-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002668.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=002668&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=002668&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
