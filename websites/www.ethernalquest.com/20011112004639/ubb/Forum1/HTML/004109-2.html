</FONT><HR>Lol, Vex the reason older people don't take the time to reply to you line by line is because they realized as they matured that they don't need to, you will too one day I promise.  Clearly you are used to getting your way by throwing a fit or yeling at peopel until they do what you want or whatever, you will hopefully grow out of this also.  The world will not respond to you because you yell at them as I think you have clearly seen on this board.  So take a lesson from experience and think it over.  I understand how maddening it is to find a cool MUD or game and have it nuked - happened to me in UO after 2 years of play and you complain about 3 months - get a grip.  Perhaps if you think about the time these admins spend on THEIR MUD you would realise they want people to play it so did you ever think that perhaps trying to talk to them with some thoughts on the state of the MUD and ideas for better play ideas would help.  Now don't go telling me you did because if you wrote it anything like the posts you have here they will react as we did and tell you to FU*&K OFF.  <BR>Do us all a favor and go away until you can hold a civil conversation.  No one cares that you are having a bad experience and no one is going to tell you how to do what you are asking.  Good bye Vex - print out these posts and put them away in a safe place until you are 25 then open them and be amazed at the way the world looks from that vantage point - do this every 5 years and you will be amazed I promise you.<P>DrCode<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=004109.cgi&ReplyNum=000042&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Taking+down+a+mud+full+of+idiots">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>#1 to Zaid:<P>"I guess I'll add my two cents here.<BR>I happen to admin a mud myself, so I have a little insight into all of this. Firstly, you claim that you've been playing this MUD for 3 months, and they've had 4 pwipes. If the things you describe have happened I suggest you find a new MUD to play. I know you say you have a lot of time invested in this one, but honestly, if they've had 4 pwipes you can't really have much of a character any more."<P>----They did one pwipe when i was about 1 and 1/2 months in, then 3 more in the next month and a half----<P> "You also said that they've gimped the classes and in your opinion the MUD is now unplayable. If this is the case, then it's even more reason to just pick up and leave. MUDs revolve around their players. If the MUD doesn't have any players, it'll eventually fade away. Leaving and finding a more enjoyable gaming experience is far more damaging than a DOS attack any day."<P>----I dont want to deal damage, i just want to get it out to them that what they're doing is stupid. This is a heavily customized mud and was great fun. I want to keep playing it and i know no one likes most of these changse yet there is nothing better----<P> "Mostly because if you don't know how to conceal your DOS, you'll more than likely find some law enforcement officials knocking on your door.<P>In reference to your comment that the MUD admins shouldn't ruin your experience by changing things while you're playing I'll agree that the situation you describe is pretty deplorable. However, all MUDs are, by definition, private. I could understand if you were investing 10 bucks a month, and they kept ruining your gaming experience, but, most MUDs are run by people that are giving up bandwidth, server space, and their free time to offer something, free of charge, to other people. They have every right to change, and destroy things as they see fit. I'm sorry that you don't agree with me on this point, but it's the truth. Furthermore, most MUDs will never reach a point where they are no longer in development, and therefore, they will never be static to the point I think you desire."<P>----They do have every right, but they obviously dont realize what they are doing and what the players are thinking. Im trying to knock them back into the real world. This is what they should expect from players, feedback, when they post their mud on lists----<P>"So, I guess I'm suggesting that the worst thing you could do is leave and find a new place to play. Forget about that mud, and just let it wither away, because if what you're describing is true, most players won't stick around for the 5th pwipe."<P>----I am right now trying to start my own mud on the same base and researching for a way to do it free, i've pretty much quit that mud----<P>Zaed.<P><BR>Edited for a few spelling errors."<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=004109.cgi&ReplyNum=000045&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Taking+down+a+mud+full+of+idiots">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>#2 To Les:<P>"Since you admit you're a "n00b", then you probably won't be able to cover your own tracks.<BR>Instead of being an ass because the admins of the MUD have caused you grief, maybe you should just try another MUD? I know, that would be just too easy right?<P>If you're expecting any help here on your little vendetta, you should probably look elsewhere. Do you actually think anyone on these boards could give a rats ass about the trouble YOU had with some MUD admins?<BR>The only one here that's pissed is you. Take it somewhere that people could give a shit.<P>Let me reitterate you inbred, since obviously your pea sized brain can't seem to understand why none of us give a shit about some MUD that YOU and ONLY YOU seem to have issues with.<BR>None of us actually give a shit, none of us care about the problems YOU have with a MUD admin, none of us will lose any sleep if you pull some shit you don't even remotely know how to do and end up in jail for it, nobody cares about your little vendetta and the fact you want to take down a MUD.<P>Clear enough for you?<BR>/em notices the site is called "Hackersquest" not "help some complete dolt who's clueless take down a MUD server<P>Yeah, you're oh so full of joy and good things, that's why you want to down someones MUD server. Think those actions won't cause problems for someone? Go troll somewhere else. I think it's been made pretty damn obvious from the majority of posts here that you're not all that welcome here.<P>About as sick as we are of having you post here? Nobody is going to help you you thick skulled moron, or hasn't that sank into your "meathead" skull yet?<BR>Oh and lose your god complex, if you think there was an ounce of "logic" in any of your posts you're sadly mistaken. Self-absorbed egotism is all you've shown in all of your messages.<P>Well you'd think so huh Vamp? It's that god complex of his that blinds what little logic he actually has. It's pretty typical though, wait until he is out of his moms house..heheh The real world is going to beat him down so badly he'll never recover and end up as another homeless statistic.<BR>*edited because my keyboard sucks and the "e" needs to be beat on with a sledghammer*"<P>----Every single one of your posts has been nothing but unsupported sad attempts at one liners and disses. Not a single strand of logic, i could argue that you didnt even read any posts. Really, i could copy and paste your posts as a flame to any other thread and they would fit in. Seeing as how you spent no time at all adressing my posts, i am done spending time on you.

</FONT><HR>#3 To D23:<P>"Vex, leaving a game because it is not what you want it to be is not running, it is called being smart.<BR>Why should they change the game to make you happy? Are you paying them? They could care less if you leave or not. And as far as you having months of time put into your character, how could you?<P>They had 4 pwipes in 3 months, unless all those happened in the last few days, that means they were spread out a bit..<P><BR>Bottom line, is it is just a free game. If you feel the admins are being a dick, then LEAVE. It is not cowardice, it is common sence. There is no reason in the world I would keep going to a restaurant if I did not like the food being serverd there. And I sure as hell would not try and cut the power to their building because their food sucked.<P>I think what people are trying to say in all our different ways is...<P>It's a game.. Don't like it? Don't play.<P>More on the original topic... What would be the end goal you have in mind? Scare the people with threats of hacking and vandalizing their equipment so that they listen to you and make the changes you want? What about the peopel that like the changes that have been done? Then they come here asking for a hack (get flamed) then they do the same thing. See where a nasty loop starts?<P>If the people running the game suck, start up your own and show them how a real good mud should be ran and then you can make all the changes you want, put all the time into a creation that you love, and have some one come along and try and shut you down because you did something that he didn't like.. "<P>----Yes i finally saw that this was the best thing to do, that is why i am trying to start my own mud.

</FONT><HR>And yet again, perfect example of how deeply seated this complex of yours is. My original post was not a diss, learn to read. It's after the fact that you start spewing all your verbal garbage that I went off on you. And I reitterate, each of your posts are self centered, egotistical pieces of trash. Each post you make concerns your thoughts, not those of an entire MUD or their admins. You obviously think the world owes you something because you seem to think you're  so "superior" to the rest of the world, or at least you believe your ideals to be so much better than anyone elses.<BR>And again, keep on the self-centered track you're on. Once you're out of your mom's house you'll be toast if you continue to think your ideals are all that matter. Say hello to street life little boy, you're on a bullet train to that kind of life.<P>Count how many people agree with you in this thread, you'll find yourself alone in your convictions, just like you'll find yourself alone once you're out of mommies care.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=004109.cgi&ReplyNum=000051&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Taking+down+a+mud+full+of+idiots">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

Idiots that just push out "insults" or whatever they wanna call it without backing it up in the slightest, claiming it doesnt need to be backed up. These are the idiots who dont have anything to say but want to take up webspace----<P>  Yet by the same token you feel free to call someone a 30 virgin without bothering to verify that fact? Leads me to believe we have found the idiot....<P>---I'm 16 and im arguing with 30 year olds and I am easily defeating them in every argument with logic, and all you idiots can come back with is more immature insults that i gave up when i was in 6th grade.---<P>  Ahhh, that explains a lot, I knew everything when I was 16 too, and as for assuming your Troll tactics are 'defeating' anyone, those are delusions. You are defeating yourself, because as I remarked above, prefaced by your own quated remarks, you are just as guilty of the things you are accusing them of, which makes you nothing more than a two-faced hypocrite, and before you say I am posting without somehting to back it up, see above, my remark is a reflection of the evidence you were so kind as to provide me with.<P>  I'd dig up more but my cut and paste fingers are getting tired and I am sure there are more interesting things to read.<P>   Point is, you have the juvenile desire to dominate everything you can, that we can plainly see from your postings, no other evidence required.<BR>   You have a propensity for violence and like to make post expressing your great manliness and ability to wreak havoc. Which, if I recall correctly from another post you made concerning someone else's bragging, generally means the exact opposite, so by your own words I have to assume that you, little boy are an immature weakling, who hides in his room making post that make you feel superior since it is the only arena in which you can do so.<BR>  I have not read this topic completely through, so I have perhaps missed somethign, but I am sure it all continues in the same vein.<P>   Actually NM, I did go read the rest and I see you did actually come to your senses in one respect... you realized that your desires to force your will on the admins of a game, thier own by the way, were futile. Perhaps there is hope for you yet, some teenagers do actually grow up to become responsible adults... THANK THE GODDESS I am not one of them.<P>  If it will make you feel better to flame me, you go right ahead. As evidenced by the upper portion of my post, I see right through you. Each of my statements and suppositions was founded in facts given to me by you yourself and I feel no further need to validate anything else you have to say, although I may have fun picking apart any replies you can generate, I truly do love a good debate, I just hate fighting a battle of wits with the unarmed.<P>   Fineas<BR>"Oh, Bother!" said Pooh as Christopher Robin slipped into the fishnet stockings and high heels again.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=004109.cgi&ReplyNum=000056&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Taking+down+a+mud+full+of+idiots">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Here's how I see it:<P>  A apparently massive post about taking down multiple user domains sits in front of me.  I read this post, and come off feeling a bit disappointed. So, instead of trying to get any content out of the post, I decide to count the number of times the word "fuck" is used.  I get to about fifteen and it's losing its entertainment value.<P>  I get a feeling of deja vu.  I recall Ice and Fire and someother guy flaming anyone, and nearly everyone, including even yours truly from time to time. It at one point got so bad that though they'd flame newbie topics until they got locked or loss interest, then they'd even move on to seemingly legitimate topics.<P>  This is why I gave up. Then 'The New, More Lovable Ice' comes along   <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"> and things clear up reasonably.  It's still here though, seems you guys just need a catalyst to get you going.<P>  The two pages of flame exchanging could have easily been summed up in two additional posts.  One saying that he should just find another MUD, and his saying that he'd rather nuke his.<P>  That's fine and dandy, if someone knows, post it (which someone eventually did), and if not, let this topic fall.<P>  Another admin strictly for the boards would be nice.   <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Wildcard<p>[This message has been edited by wildcard (edited 10-09-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=004109.cgi&ReplyNum=000057&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Taking+down+a+mud+full+of+idiots">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

You are obviously just a flamer that tries to piss people off but fails miserably----"<P>Using your own "logic" against you we see that you didn't really "address a post" here. Instead you decided to stick it at the top of your post and then completely ignore it except for in vague references such as:<P>"Every single one of your posts has been nothing but unsupported sad attempts at one liners and disses."<P>Now, looking specifically at that, the majority of your posts have also been "nothing but unsupported sad attempts at one liners and disses." If you look at your posts and replies you'll realize that they are more unfounded insults than arguments. This is mainly because you have very few arguments and even those are unfounded. Here are they arguments as best as I could see (if I missed any, please tell me, it was hard to find them between the insults):<P>You don't like the changes on the MUD.<BR>-The MUD isn't really yours and it's not made for you specifically.<P>You want to somehow "get back at" the MUD.<BR>-If this is true, don't do something illegal, make your own or go somewhere else. I'm glad to see that you're beginning to be proactive and started trying to make your own. With all honesty, this is the first truly intelligent thing you've done.<P>In an earlier post you threatened physical harm to people. That's not a sign of maturity there. Saying that you can or will hurt people is a sign of plain stupidity. Being such an "enlightened" individual, you should agree with me on this.<P>You yourself have stated that insulting people is a sign of stupidity, so why do you do it yourself? Looking at even the top line of your posts we can immediatley see that you are being insulting and hostile. It's very hypocritical to do something and then say other people are stupid for doing the same.<P>As to you being sixteen and out-arguing thirty-year-olds, I have to say that's no true. You're just flinging insults back and forth, that's all. There have been some good arguments presented against you, but you've chosen not to argue against them, especially where legal issues arise.<P>I, too, am sixteen and have posted this entire message without insults or expletives. Please try to hold yourselves to a higher standard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=004109.cgi&ReplyNum=000058&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Taking+down+a+mud+full+of+idiots">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>This is an incredibly long line of posts. I figured the horse would be dead by the end of the first page, and found more. Crazy. I have, in fact, learned a few things about those involved by following it, however. I saw perhaps three people who treated the topic in a mature manner, while every single other person seemed to say "You're selfish, and you believe your opinions are the only one's out there," while turning around and offering some self-righteous opinions of their own, or simply laying out in a row blatantly simple insults, be it childish cracks about one's mother, or strings of "Get the fuck out of here," "Contribute to Society," or a crass "You're not welcome here." Some good points were made, but they seemed to be eclisped by harsh generalizations, and broad judgements, on both sides of the argument. Then again, we also saw groups of names plug each other, and band together in unity in order to ostracize the opposition, much like we used to see in High School, when 2 or 3 kids would huddle together and pat themselves on the back while dispensing insults to the confused kid at the other side. Nor do I justify the words of the 'bad guy' either. I do believe that for a 16 year old, he is very perceptive. His motives may altogether be out of place, but I saw one particular post that dealt with this in a very mature and neutral manner. After that, the insults really coudl've stopped, the topic could've been forgotten, and everyone could've moved on to more productive tasks. But as pseudo-arguments usually do, this one kept going long after the expiration date, and stands as a rather good example of the reactions of those placed into an argument. Has certain persons not thrown the first stone, countless minutes could've been saved. Nevermind feeding a troll. I'll buy everyone their next meal. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=004109.cgi&ReplyNum=000061&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Taking+down+a+mud+full+of+idiots">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Ok, seeing how you guys don't appreciate the way i dissect posts line by line, every line. I will go to your tactics of quoting sections i want and answering just those.<P>Les said:<BR>"i"..."a"..."m"..."a"..."c"..."om"..."p"..."l"..."e"..."t"..."e"..."idiot".<P>Now see what only quoting sections of a post can do? Thats why i don't do it, and i dont appreciate when people try to get away with it. Picking the few weak arguments and ignoring the multiple strong arguments. Now that outsiders are coming in, unbiased outsiders, they are the first to claim that, *Oh my god*, I am not the only one to blame in this argument. You guys claim I'm a hypocrite for posting that one liner about Les, i've argued his posts before, line by line, and that only stopped him until he saw another post to cling onto. So, i just copied and pasted all his posts line for line for the reader to see the truth. Also, at the middle of the page I offer to address any posts you want, so I am not a hypocrite. If you call me a hypocrite for using the word "idiot" or "moron", it's nothing compared to the 30 year olds using...."immature fuck"...."jesus, you are a fucking retard"..."inbred"..."pea sized brain "*laf*..."fuck off and try to actually contribute to society"....."Vex, shut the fuck up"..."Now shut the fuck up"...."I'd like to see him try that IRL... he'd just get his ass beat."***Quick pause, this line is the ONLY reason i included anything physical about me, and, i NEVER threatened anyone on here by physical harm, read once, then read again, then have your mother read it to you a third time if you still aren't sure you understand before you post***..."thick skulled moron"....""meathead""...."Get the fuck out of here"<P>Now, as for calling someone a 30 year old virgin, he posted "you need to get laid" lol.... now i was just directly adressing that. Anyway,<P>"Now, looking specifically at that, the majority of your posts have also been "nothing but unsupported sad attempts at one liners and disses.""<P>Are you reading this with your eyes open? Up until now I have addressed every single post line by line, or at least 90% of them that were longer than 3 lines of flame.<P>Thats all i have the patience to post tinight, late</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=004109.cgi&ReplyNum=000062&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Taking+down+a+mud+full+of+idiots">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>    Almost every poster here has valid points, unfortunatly; your insults and flames take away your credibility.  And yes, i mean you.  <BR>    In response to violence being part of human nature, and some people not wanting to retaliate for the terrorist's acts, here's my view: They don't have to be punished in life.  We should kill them, but only to prevent more deaths they would cause if left alive.  They will get their due in whatever hell awaits them.  <BR>     Eventually, we will evolve to the point where violence within our species is unheard of.  Or else, we will die, and the world will continue without humanity.  I leave you with that up-beat outlook to the future.<P>------------------<BR>Please don't feed the druid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=004109.cgi&ReplyNum=000064&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Taking+down+a+mud+full+of+idiots">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/004109-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/004109.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=004109&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=004109&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
