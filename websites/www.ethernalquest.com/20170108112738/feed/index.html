				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a day and age where technology is everything, there&#8217;s no surprise some of the most advanced pieces we&#8217;re seeing comes to different gaming platforms first. Things like virtual reality headsets or VR for short, are allowing gamers to interact with games in a way they haven&#8217;t before. One such device like this is called the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VF0IXEY/?&amp;amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=recpor-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;linkId=6233b5a474625ae6ee084e03f992f144&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325">Oculus Rift</a> which is among the latest in virtual reality technology that has recently hit the Australian market. The Oculus Rift has a lot to offer those who invest in this virtual reality headset and for a great price.</p>
<h2>Oculus Rift virtual technology</h2>
<p>The technology used to make the Oculus Rift is one that was made not only for a great experience but for comfort and flexibility as well. When makers set to work to make this great piece of technology, they did so in a way that was meant to provide the person wearing it comfort, an enjoyable experience and the ability to adjust it to their needs. We&#8217;ve got to say that overall it appears they&#8217;ve exceeded in doing exactly that.</p>
<p><span id="more-10"></span></p>
<p>This virtual reality device allows users to download a wide range of games from different genre&#8217;s so that every user will be able to find something they like. Upon purchasing this virtual reality headset, each person will have an already pre-downloaded game on it to play for free. There are a few specifications for anyone who wants to use one of these great products and we&#8217;ll get to that shortly.</p>
<h2>What do I need to use the Oculus Rift?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in <a href="http://www.ethernalquest.com/the-oculus-rift-is-coming-to-australia-eventually-but-you-dont-have-to-wait/">purchasing an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset in Australia</a> , you&#8217;ll need a reliable internet connection. The internet connection is mainly for downloading different games to the headset to play, and for any games that can be played online with other users. While there are some virtual reality headsets that can be used on different consoles, you&#8217;ll find that the Oculus Rift is for PC users only. Unfortunately, if you have a PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 or one of the Xbox consoles, then this is not compatible and you&#8217;ll have to consider using a different headset. You&#8217;ll also need a pretty powerful computer to do justice to the animations.</p>
<h2>Features of the Oculus Rift</h2>
<p>The great thing that most people tend to love about the Oculus Rift, is that it can be used standing or in a sitting position. While many similar virtual reality headsets operate in a way that requires the user to be standing and moving around, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VF0IXEY/?&amp;amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=recpor-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;linkId=6233b5a474625ae6ee084e03f992f144&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325">Oculus Rift</a> is capable of being used in either instance. If you&#8217;re a person who wears glasses, you can still use the Oculus Rift. In fact, its design was made in a way that allows users to wear the headset over the glasses and even adjust them to match your range of vision.</p>
<p>There are quite a few items that you should expect when ordering the box that will help you to be set up for use of the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset that include:</p>
<p>&#8211; The actual Oculus Rift headset which is what you&#8217;ll be playing and downloading games on</p>
<p>&#8211; A camera sensor which is what allows the headset to know when your moving and specific actions</p>
<p>&#8211; Remote to control the settings and headset</p>
<p>&#8211; Batteries which are used to operate the headset and likely the remote as well</p>
<p>&#8211; Lens cleaner wipes to keep your headset clean and to prevent from scratching it using other methods</p>
<p>&#8211; Wireless controllers</p>
<p>&#8211; Oculus stickers that can be placed on the headset</p>
<p>&#8211; And more!</p>
<p>One thing you&#8217;ll notice about all the key features combined with what is shipped to you when you <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VF0IXEY/?&amp;amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=recpor-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;linkId=6233b5a474625ae6ee084e03f992f144&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325">order an Oculus Rift headset</a>, is that you&#8217;re getting your money&#8217;s worth when you purchase. The company will set users up with all the accessories and information they could need to successfully operate the headset and have fun while doing so. Of course, if you&#8217;re a person who is prone to seizures then it&#8217;s highly recommended that you read the health guide that comes with it to make sure you can operate this headset safely.</p>
<p>The oculus was made with you the user in mind and thus things like the remote were created so that users could experience a more personalized experience when playing games. The <a href="/">Oculus Rift virtual reality headset</a> is by far one of the best on the market today and has a lot to offer to those who enjoy gaming. Unlike some, you&#8217;re not limited to just playing one game, or even just a handful from one genre. Instead, when purchasing this great piece of technology, you&#8217;re given the freedom to choose to play something that you would enjoy and regularly enjoy gaming with, or try something new from a different genre.</p>
<p>The Oculus Rift has opened a whole new world of gaming for a lot of people and it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s completely compatible with different accessories so that everything is at the touch of a fingertip and easily accessible and usable.</p>
<p>Even for those who might be new to the world of virtual reality headsets, the Oculus can be operated and used by just about anyone. There is no difficult setup, no hard to understand directions. While this may be advanced technology in the world of virtual reality headsets, it&#8217;s easy to use and the directions are simple yet clear. The age range can vary from youth to even older generations with games to suit all players. This headset will have you believing you&#8217;re in the game and forget about just playing a game, with the highest quality of graphics and features.</p>
<h2>Australian Oculus Rift Release Date</h2>
<p>You can buy it now and have it shipped to you in three working days at a cost considerably cheaper than purchasing from Oculus Rift. With a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VF0IXEY/?&amp;amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=recpor-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;linkId=6233b5a474625ae6ee084e03f992f144&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325">sale price of $599 plus shipping of just $32.80 to Australia, you can save hundreds of dollars!</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a Christmas gift this coming holiday for a family member or friend, then we suggest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VF0IXEY/?&amp;amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=recpor-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;linkId=6233b5a474625ae6ee084e03f992f144&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325">purchasing the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset</a> for that special someone in your life. Of course, the product is backed with an insurance plan that can be added on and the manufacturer&#8217;s warranty will have you covered if you decide to not purchase extended coverage.</p>
<p>When you think of gaming and the future, the first thing that comes to mind is the Oculus Rift.</p>
