</FONT><HR>It's not logged if you do a zero delay mend or backstab, it just tells you the timer isn't up yet. They don't log it because errors can occur where the client is told they can use it again but the server says they can't. Anyway, TSD are you the one who's trying to do the spell changes to port you? Consider looking into setting up a Minor Shielding = Mischief Castle Gate or Minor Shielding = Mischief Entry Gate (both are ports that take you to PoM). That zones one hell of a bitch to get into, a hacked port to get in would be a lifesaver (oh the poor FDing monks, the pain they must suffer to drag a sad CotH Mage corpse to the PoM zone and then waste a charge on a VoX rez stick to wake the bastard up so he can CotH the rest of his group).<P>Dysassymbler<P>P.S. - Verant badly needs to add a faction you can improve with upper ToV so you can get to PoM a little easier, as of now it's insanely hard. Not just tough, INSANE!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003050.cgi&ReplyNum=000042&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Spell+Hacking+Guide">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>TSD your ignoranse is much biger than you think, and i quote you...<BR>---------------------------<BR>"Oooooo. It's the good old "Verant Conspiracy". The tired notion that Verant has patrols who check this board to make sure we don't do anything bad, evil, blah blah blah blah blah... Just out of curiosity... Why can I still use Sense Heading as Mend?"<BR>---------------------------<BR>SH= Mend wasn't fixed. What they did was like putting a bandaid on a severed arm. So you can't use it if you're not a monk. No-delay mend is still pretty strong. Same with no delay-backstab. So they installed a classed based filter. Oh damn.<BR>---------------------------<BR>Can you see my point here?<BR>You cant use Mend if you are not a monk...hhhmm looks to me like a fix how about you?<BR>Also ALL the "no delay" hacks were fixed with the last patch.<BR>And why you think they changed the day for the upcoming patch 3 times already?...i tell you why...because they probably fixing the /zone as well.<BR>Now to make it clear...i never knew about the /zone hack untill it was posted here, i knew that some people like Icon and Tel0net had it but i like the rest of the people here didnt have it.<BR>I dont care if they fix it but you and your friends ruined it for every one that had it, i hope you feel proud of your self for being Verants little bitch.<BR>Go ahead and flame now...you cant flame as good as ICE any way, you are no good even at that <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>PS: sorry about my bad English <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003050.cgi&ReplyNum=000043&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Spell+Hacking+Guide">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>"sorry but no it wont that last ghu plugin you got was all of what was left of the hacks...They will be fixed."<BR>"Well, I'd be inclined to believe you, but unfortunately, Verant first of all, HASN'T fixed them, and second of all, CAN'T fix most of them. It's just the way their net code works and the way their program was written."<P>What part of WILL didn't you understand? Aswell they can fix whatever they want its their program.<P><BR>"BTW what is up with this "we will redo the hacks and make them work again", No you guys wont."<P>"We won't HAVE to redo them if Verant doesn't FIX them. Verant can't change certain things, IE -- anything involving movement. They also can't change the skill replacement (SH = Mend, etc. etc.). Why? Because of the way their program is written. If they want to rewrite their program because of us, then good for them. I'd feel proud if I assisted in causing them that much trouble." <P><BR>Proud for being their little work bitch? /bow<P>"They will fix the /zone hack by checking if you are near the zone line, to the zone the client told the server to zone into."<P>"I would type something but I'm too busy laughing so hard I'm coughing up blood."<P>So what happened? You finished the rest of my post....hmm ic<P>"Yes that is also why I do it =) ...but it isn't memory values its looking and editing asm code. Trust me looking at memory values is no whre near as fun."<P>"I'm sure assembly is fun. Now do you want me to tell you to stop working on assembly because I have a soft spot for the original settings on computers and I don't think that they should be messed with? Look at what you're telling Fsck_Verant and I."<P>No, I'm saying looking at memory values is not fun or hard. Its just takes all day =P<P>"Trust me, There in noway looking at memory values will help the emu"<P>"I'm sure it won't but what we can deduce from the memory values MIGHT help. Again, I'm not saying it will, I say it MIGHT. For example, the duration formula. That MIGHT help. Or, when we get around to it, finding out how the server calculates adjacency. That MIGHT help. MIGHT."<BR>"<BR>ok...THERE IS NO FUCKING WAY IT WILL HELP THE EMU<P>"Thats why I see these must be fixed b/c its bullshit for anyone playing to have that happen to them"<P>"Oh yeah? What about falling beneath the world for 10,000 damage and not having anything be done about it? What about being stuck in the geometry while the Hermit kicks your ass and not being able to do a thing? Face it. This game has problems. A LOT of stuff needs to be fixed. Most of it CAN'T be fixed. It's the sad truth."<P>yeah it is but you don't need to add to it<P>"about to kill someone they /zone...it has a BIG affect on pvp<P>"There's an excellent command called /petition for people like that. You tell a GM about it, and they'll have people watching them. And when you do high profile stuff like /zone right before someone kills you, that's about as conspicuous as using a movement hack and /shout "WHO WANTS TO RACE, BITCHES????""<P>No they wont care about a petition about that. They will think someone had lag and poofed and a pk twink doesn't get killed a whole lot. So there will be very few "real cheater" petitions like that<P>"me to but some things are not ment to be given out"<P>"Now what we have here is a double standard. And it seems the only reason you don't want /zone released is because you're trying to protect your ass on PvP. Commendable." <P><BR>I didn't want it released b/c some people already had it and you just fucked it for them. for what? so a few people that vist this board( as you said it close to none ..nice job *sigh*) can use them for the little while more they're out. As you can see on my other post I said pkers, I don't go around doing mindless pking and zone whenever i'm about to die. so STFU<P><BR>-Pac0<p>[This message has been edited by Pac0 (edited 07-06-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003050.cgi&ReplyNum=000044&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Spell+Hacking+Guide">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>"What part of WILL didn't you understand? Aswell they can fix whatever they want its their program."<P>That made sense. I guess. But, I'll try and decipher what I can... Sure, they can fix whatever they want because it's "their program", but then again, Ashran can make the emu do whatever he wants because it's "his program". It's a matter of whether or not it will actually happen, and whether or not it CAN happen. Verant can NOT change the movement from server-side to client side without completely restructuring their net code. And if they did change it from client side to server side, they'd have a shit game that would run slow as fuck. And guess what. I'd be proud.  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>"Proud for being their little work bitch? /bow"<P>Okay, that made no sense and that didn't address a thing I said. The only thing it did was let me see the irony in this situation. You've been playing devil's advocate for so long, now you actually WANT Verant to fix things so you can make a point. Feel better, champ.<P><BR>"So what happened? You finished the rest of my post....hmm ic"<P>*sighs* You have no ability to read between the lines or draw conclusions, do you. While I'm sure the REST of the HQ community got what I was saying, I'll spell it out for you. What you suggested, (them checking if you're near the zone line), is completely impossible. They can't do that unless they change movement and location to server side. So your suggested method of fixing it was for lack of a better word, retarted.<P>"No, I'm saying looking at memory values is not fun or hard. Its just takes all day =P"<P>How about typing up responding to intelligent posts with mindless drivel? How long does that take?<P>"ok...THERE IS NO FUCKING WAY IT WILL HELP THE EMU"<P>That might be the case. But then again, there's no fucking way you'll ever sound intelligent, there's no fucking way your post will sound like something written by someone who's passed the 4th grade, there's no fucking way that you will ever be able to pick up on subtlety and read between the lines, there's no fucking way you'll prove yourself right because of your limited vocabulary and speaking skills. But that's just the way the cards are dealt. So, in that case, I can live with not helping the emu.  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>"Face it. This game has problems. A LOT of stuff needs to be fixed. Most of it CAN'T be fixed. It's the sad truth."<P>"yeah it is but you don't need to add to it"<P>Again, the only information *I* released was information that they can't change unless they completely restructure their program. Like intra-zone teleporting. They CAN NOT CHANGE THAT. Falling through the world? THEY CAN NOT CHANGE THAT. Getting stuck in geometry? THEY CAN NOT CHANGE THAT. I just tossed another lump of shit on to the compost heap that makes up Verant's game.<P><BR> "No they wont care about a petition about that. They will think someone had lag and poofed and a pk twink doesn't get killed a whole lot. So there will be very few "real cheater" petitions like that"<P>Do you know a damned thing about how the system works? Better yet... Do you know a damned thing about how ANYTHING works? Let me try to explain a simple concept to you. They get a tip that someone's been cheating. They look into it, and if it checks out, they watch the person. If they get hard proof that the person cheating, they ban/suspend (mostly the latter) them. So if you petition a movement hack, they check into it, and if the person is just using SOW, they dismiss it. If you petition a PKer using /zone, they check into it. If you're just a pissy bitch and he ran away or gated, they dismiss it. See, things become a bit clearer when you talk things out...  It's called logic, it'll help us all.<P><BR>"I didn't want it released b/c some people already had it and you just fucked it for them. for what? so a few people that vist this board( as you said it close to none ..nice job *sigh*) can use them for the little while more they're out.

</FONT><HR>"What part of WILL didn't you understand? Aswell they can fix whatever they want its their program."<P><BR>"That made sense. I guess. But, I'll try and decipher what I can... Sure, they can fix whatever they want because it's "their program", but then again, Ashran can make the emu do whatever he wants because it's "his program".It's a matter of whether or not it will actually happen, and whether or not it CAN happen. Verant can NOT change the movement from server-side to client side without completely restructuring their net code. And if they did change it from client side to server side, they'd have a shit game that would run slow as fuck. And guess what. I'd be proud."<P>Yes it is a matter of if they will do it or not but it has been proven time and again that and workwhile hacks coming out of this fourm will be taken care of ...why don't you understand?? As for taking movement to serverside ; They wouldn't have to. Most of it already is server-side. They would just need to add checks.<BR> <P>"Proud for being their little work bitch? /bow"<BR>"Okay, that made no sense and that didn't address a thing I said. The only thing it did was let me see the irony in this situation. You've been playing devil's advocate for so long, now you actually WANT Verant to fix things so you can make a point. Feel better, champ."<P>No they other guy had a point. So I thought I would point it out again. Your showing them what they have to fix, hence being their bitch.<P><BR>"So what happened? You finished the rest of my post....hmm ic"<P>"*sighs* You have no ability to read between the lines or draw conclusions, do you. While I'm sure the REST of the HQ community got what I was saying, I'll spell it out for you. What you suggested, (them checking if you're near the zone line), is completely impossible. They can't do that unless they change movement and location to server side. So your suggested method of fixing it was for lack of a better word, retarted."<P>No I was being somewhat sarcastic. Guess I'll have to brake it down for you. The servers know your loc and speed at all times.... It is in the packet format. All they would have to do is put some checks in like this.<P>if (zone_request){<BR>getloc(x,y,z);  // which the server has at all times<BR>get_valid_zoning_locs(lx,ly,lz,hx2,hy2,hz2,zonename);<P>if( (x &gt; lx) && (x &lt; hx2) ) //checks to see if your in a valid zoning spot for x<P>{ <BR>check = 1;<BR>}<P>if( (y &gt; ly) && (y &lt; hy2) ) //checks to see if your in a valid zoning spot for y<P>{ <BR>check2 = 1;<BR>}<P>if( (z &gt; lz) && (z &lt; hz2) ) //checks to see if your in a valid zoning spot for z<P>{ <BR>check3 = 1;<BR>}<P>check = check + check2 + check3; // adds checks<P>if(check = 3) //checks if everything is valid<BR>{<BR>allow_zone = 1;<BR>check = 0;<BR>} else<BR>{ <BR>flag_cheater = 1;<BR>check = 0;<BR>}<BR>}<P><BR>That code would only run when a client wanted to zone, which is not to often. Putting little to no cpu strain on the servers. So please learn what your talking about before you come on these boards and start shooting your mouth off.<P><BR>"No, I'm saying looking at memory values is not fun or hard. Its just takes all day =P"<P>"How about typing up responding to intelligent posts with mindless drivel? How long does that take?"<P>It's not needed for unintelligent people like yourself.<P><BR>"ok...THERE IS NO FUCKING WAY IT WILL HELP THE EMU"<P>"That might be the case. But then again, there's no fucking way you'll ever sound intelligent, there's no fucking way your post will sound like something written by someone who's passed the 4th grade, there's no fucking way that you will ever be able to pick up on subtlety and read between the lines, there's no fucking way you'll prove yourself right because of your limited vocabulary and speaking skills. But that's just the way the cards are dealt. So, in that case, I can live with not helping the emu."<P><BR>Guess the little baby got mad. About time you understand =P  <P><BR>"Face it. This game has problems. A LOT of stuff needs to be fixed. Most of it CAN'T be fixed. It's the sad truth."<P>"yeah it is but you don't need to add to it"<P>"Again, the only information *I* released was information that they can't change unless they completely restructure their program. Like intra-zone teleporting. They CAN NOT CHANGE THAT. Falling through the world? THEY CAN NOT CHANGE THAT. Getting stuck in geometry? THEY CAN NOT CHANGE THAT. I just tossed another lump of shit on to the compost heap that makes up Verant's game."<P>They can fix intra-zone teleporting. I'm not going to write code for it but trust me in can be done with little strain on servers. I know what you released. If it was something I said about other hex/hack. Then it wasn't intended for you. Sorry you couldn't understand that.<P><BR>"No they wont care about a petition about that. They will think someone had lag and poofed and a pk twink doesn't get killed a whole lot. So there will be very few "real cheater" petitions like that"<P>"Do you know a damned thing about how the system works? Better yet... Do you know a damned thing about how ANYTHING works? Let me try to explain a simple concept to you. They get a tip that someone's been cheating. They look into it, and if it checks out, they watch the person. If they get hard proof that the person cheating, they ban/suspend (mostly the latter) them. So if you petition a movement hack, they check into it, and if the person is just using SOW, they dismiss it. If you petition a PKer using /zone, they check into it. If you're just a pissy bitch and he ran away or gated, they dismiss it. See, things become a bit clearer when you talk things out... It's called logic, it'll help us all."<P>/sigh , guess you don't play pvp<P>"I didn't want it released b/c some people already had it and you just fucked it for them. for what? so a few people that vist this board( as you said it close to none ..nice job *sigh*) can use them for the little while more they're out. As you can see on my other post I said pkers, I don't go around doing mindless pking and zone whenever i'm about to die. so STFU"<P>"I weep for every cheater at this message board who can't cheat anymore because of something I didn't release. *weep* "<P>why do you have to be an asshole all the time?? Just be a man and say "oops, I'm wrong"<P><BR>"Pac0, to sum this post up, give it up. You're just digging yourself deeper and deeper.

</FONT><HR>"Yes it is a matter of if they will do it or not but it has been proven time and again that and workwhile hacks coming out of this fourm will be taken care of ...why don't you understand??"<P>Okay. Name 10 hacks that were relased before June 1, 2001 that were fixed.<P><BR>"As for taking movement to serverside ; They wouldn't have to. Most of it already is server-side. They would just need to add checks."<P>Okay. To address your "check" method. I think you forgot about gate, kiddo. And teleport. And dieing. Just so you know, a zone request is ALWAYS made by the client. There goes your entire check idea. <P>"No they other guy had a point. So I thought I would point it out again."<P>How original. Cute, though.<P>"Your showing them what they have to fix, hence being their bitch."<P>Mmmhmm. You don't seem to realize that Verant realizes that 90% of these cheats exist. They only fix them when they have to. We're not telling them what to fix, they're deciding WHEN to fix it.<P><BR>"The servers know your loc and speed at all times.... It is in the packet format... *snip*"<P>See my above explanation as to why your cute little program won't do a darn thing. Now, what were you saying about knowing things before shooting your mouth off, kiddo? *shrugs* Need I say more?<P><BR>"It's not needed for unintelligent people like yourself."<P>I see that this is an attempt to be witty... Right... I'm sure it could be, if it made sense. See, that "it's" in the sentence had to refer to either the direct object (my intelligent posts) or indirect object (your mindless drivel). So, I assume, unless you wanted to be contradictory (by referring to my posts intelligent, but calling me the contrary), you were referring to your own mindless drivel. So we're left with "My mindless drivel isn't needed for unintelligent people like you." Hm. Kind of like the old homeless guy hunched over his cardboard home, defending it from a rich guy who walks by. Good job.<P><BR>"Guess the little baby got mad. About time you understand =P"<P>  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"> Oh lordy. Now he's trying to be clever via condescention. Mmhmm. Good try, kiddo, but you're trying to fight a tank with a toothpick. Try using intelligent, or if not intelligent, clever insults. <P>"They can fix intra-zone teleporting. I'm not going to write code for it"<P>Uhm... What was that disgusting spawn of bad programming that you typed up there earlier involving 'checks' and 'cheat flags'? It sure looked like code to me, but I guess that could have been a bad comedy attempt instead of actual programming...<P>"/sigh , guess you don't play pvp"<P>Mm, I love a good one sentence answer that has nothing to do with what I said at all. I assume you're implying that because I don't play PvP, I don't know how the GM system works there. So why don't you take the oppurtunity to enlighten us all with your infinite wisdom and tell us exactly how you think the GM system works? I think we could all use a good laugh...<P><BR>"why do you have to be an asshole all the time?? Just be a man and say "oops, I'm wrong""<P>You're insinuating that I think I'm wrong. On the contrary. Again, your meager social skills have crippled your sarcasm radar, so you passed right over the "weep" comment. So, once again, I will spell it out for you. "I really don't care about the people who can't cheat because I released a spell hack. Because that's the nature of cheating. It might get fixed one day. They should know that when they start cheating."<P><BR>"yeah unhuh....I hope your not as delusional in the real world."<P>Well, if you've noticed, I was completely accurate in my prediction. You landed on me, tried to sting me, I laughed for a good long time, and then proceeded to squish you again. <P>It requires little to no effort on my part, so by all means, continue to post. /bow<P>TSD<P>                       <p>[This message has been edited by Terminal Spirit Disease (edited 07-07-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003050.cgi&ReplyNum=000048&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Spell+Hacking+Guide">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>They WILL fix the /zone command I don't see what the difficulty would be to fix it. The fix is rather very easly done. The only problem they will have is to issue a new EQgame.exe file out to all the guides. To fix it for the rest of us all they have to do is is move the test if you are a GM, Guide, or just user to server. Which can be done very easly. There are some hacks which they will never patch because to do so would cost them major reprograming time and money.
