</FONT><HR>Hey, here's a new idea, this could be very evil also...<P>If you DID accelerate to the speed of light, any particle with mass (that is able to be measured and isnt under .1) you hit in space would basically kill you instantly, it would be like being shot with a sniper rifle at point blank range. So basically, if light has a mass, no matter what....and you smashed into like light when it wasnt all streched out all over the universe, wouldnt it smack you into oblivion or form you into  a black hole?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000082&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>If you were going the speed of light one would have to assume you found a way to have no mass otherwise you couldn't be going the speed of light. If you have no mass then you could assume that collisions would not be a problem for you.<BR>However, for those approaching the speed of light that have mass would turn themselves into space dust if you collided with microscopic particles. <P>It won't be too long in the future when some major satellite system is taken out by a  piece of trash travelling at a mere 18,000 mph left in orbit from the past 30 years of space exploration.

</FONT><HR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Everyone - The big bang happens, everything expands at the speed of light.. slows down.. comes back to the big crunch.. (effectively the speed of light when it hit's the crunch)<BR>and the process repeats. (closed universe theory)<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>So far there's only one example for it, but a scientist has located a star at the outskirts of our galaxy that from all outward appearances is *speeding up*.  They believe that this is an indication that our universe is continually expanding, however I'm more of the opinion that this star has traveled so far outside of the gravitational pull of the center of our universe, that another universe not perceiveable may have actually interfered with this sun, which explains it's accelerated rate.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Light does have resistance.<P>The current speed of light is based upon how it travels in Kr.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>If light had resistance, the quality of it's light would degrade, and it's speed would decrease.  When I speak of resistance, I'm not talking about what the light actually affects.  When there is matter with measureable dimension (ie., height, width, and depth) in a given region, it is going to impede some of the light's progress.  As an example, if the light is traveling through a *perfect* sheet of glass, so perfectly designed that to you it looks invisible ... some of the light is still colliding with that glass, and generating friction, which, along with the reflected light that the surface doesn't absorb, creates another wavelength of light that might be measureable with machinery that can sense light wavelengths.<P>The type of resistance I'm talking about is that which affects the speed, amplitude, etc.  If I shoot a beam of light into space, assuming that nothing gets in the way to stop it, or reflect it, it will continue on at the same constant speed.  If there were any resistance to light, then I don't see how accelerating a pulse of light to 300 times the speed of light could be possible.  I honestly think that when a vibration moves along the axis/dimension used, there is no resistance, hence if a pulse of light is accelerated to 300 times the speed of light, it will constantly be that speed until it collides with something.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Gravity can warp light (as proven by the law of relativity)<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>If this latest theory is accurate, that light -- when accelerated under the correct conditions -- truly can move at 300 times the speed of light, it would be interesting to attempt an experiment to see if gravity affected this beam of light as well.  I'm certain it would, and I don't know what it would prove or disprove if it didn't ... but as I said, it would be interesting to find out.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>you guys are some smart mother fuckers... but about that going in another dimension deal by going through a black hole... well thats alod off bull shit. i dont see anything on earth that will fucking send us into another dimension... therfore in my opinon black holes do not take you into another dimension but they smash you up into a million peacies.... i know none of that stuff was said on the previous posts but oh well.... i cant type<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Very intelligent and well thought out.  You should write a book.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>CodeSculptor said:<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; For instance, electrons. They exist ONLY when forced to.<P>Oh, really? What forces them to exist?<P>I bet the thing that forces them to exist is an entity controlled by determinism. Well, hey, so much for the non-deterministic existence of electrons in our universe.<P>If an entity governed by determinism creates or modifies another entity, that creation or modification is also deterministic.<P>It's called inductive reasoning and it works, folks.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Your both thinking very 3 dimensionally still.<P>Those 'forces' you talk about are effects of higher dimensions (if you like the theory ... i do, so i use it).  Again, where you have height, width, and depth, you also have time, temperature, gravity, light, and various other 'forces' in nature ... including what scientists call the 'strong', 'weak', 'electromagnetic', and 'gravitational' forces.<P>As Michio Kaku put it in his his book 'Hyperspace', a 'force' is what scientists label something they don't understand, and oft-times (if not in all cases) can be described easier by the nth dimension-type theories (superstring and such).  Saying absurd things along the lines of electrons/protons/neutrons *can* make an atom, but don't have to, is about like saying water doesn't have to flow downhill.  There are physical laws in nature that make things happen.  It may take thousands, perhaps millions of years for sub-atomic particles to re-form into an atom, and depending on the circumstances, longer still to create molecular bonds, but it will eventually happen.<P>Perhaps it's similar to gravity.  On the sub-atomic level, those particles might be thousands, millions, or billions of miles away.  Perhaps light-years even.  For the 'forces' that govern particle formations to do what is necessary, it may take an extremely long time to form a single atom, similar to a sun or planet taking millions of years to form.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>PS: Some of you people put way too much stock in scientists and scholars. They can be wrong. They're more likely to be right than I am, sure, but don't quote them or their textbooks as the Gospel of Truth in Science and the Universe without knowledge of your own or you're just as dopey as a creationist who's never actually met their god or investigated fossils. Think, examine, pick apart, investigate.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Lemme get this straight, if my chosen field of work is in computer science, I should just forget about ever discussing quantum physics with anyone because all my time is either spent working, learning, relaxing, or spending time with people in my life, and I don't have time to get a physics degree, and study physics.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Time travel - For the guy who talked about points,lines,planes, space, and time. Nice idea but it lacks an explanation of the arrow of time. Why do we see a past and present and not just "left time" and "right time". Just something you might want to think about. <BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>hehe.  Well, I'm talking about there being more perceiveable dimensions to matter than what we describe as height, width and depth.<P>For example ... temperature.  If something is cold, is that the absence of heat?  Or is heat the absence of cold?  When something is 'cold', what has changed?  Does it have increased 'mass' in one of those not-perceiveable dimensions?  Or is it lacking that mass (ie., being the absence of heat).<P>When speaking of time, if time is in fact yet another measureable dimension, then it would mean that all things in the universe have a measureable 'time', or perhaps a better term is 'age'.  If this is true, then you could also postulate that if left alone, the 'time' dimension on increases at the same rate for everything.  If the idea that traveling at different speeds can affect the increase in 'mass' along this dimension, then it's also possible to imagine that it might be possible to change the size of this dimension.<P>How would this affect matter?  If there is no physical law that prevents the changing of the size of time for something, and you could manage to affect the growth/increase, or directly affect the size of the time of everything inside a container (ie., spacecraft moving the speed of light), would it affect our memories?  Our perception of the universe?  Are the reactions of things in other measureable dimensions in some way dependent on that time, and in what way?  if you could 'stunt' the growth of your own time, would that simply make you not age ever again?  Or would that also stop all chemical reactions and movements in your body, effectively making everything in your body stop moving and changing ... at which point, could your body physically fly apart?  ... which could support the idea that mass approaches infinity when a particles speed approaches the speed of light.<P>I'm not thinking on terms of other 'slices' of unseen matter, similar to Michio Kaku's example of the 2 dimensional 'flatlander' falling through a 3 dimensional world and seeing things change size/shape, and being amazed that all of the flatlander's physical laws had been refuted by his trip through 3d space ... and a 3d person being thrown through a 4-dimensional world and seeing things change their dimensions which to us would seem impossible ... that, while possible and/or believeable, isn't what I mean.  I'm talking about unseen things that affect our world that people call 'forces', and feel that they need give no further definition to.  They are not seperate and different, they are all related, and tied into how we and everything around us works more than people realize.<P>In closing, I think that light is simply the vibration that occurs along a different axis, and given the right type of matter in the path the light has taken, part of it's frequency will change.  Some of the light may pass through the object in it's path, while some collides with and is either absorbed (giving off heat, which gives off yet more light), or is reflected/refracted.<P>Experiments have been done that help to show that light can pass unimpeded through matter, as if the light had 'gone around' the matter in it's path:<P>../\..../\<BR>./..\../Au\<BR>/....\/AuAu\<P>In my beautiful picture above, imagine that the Au's represent what would be blocking the light (the experiment was done with gold, which is why I chose Au, the symbol for gold on the periodic table of elements)<P>similar to this:<P>-----------Au------&gt;|<P>In the experiment, the light passed through the sheet & collided with a surface on the opposite side, which helped to support the idea that light moves 'in and out' of our perceiveable dimension.<P>-Phantal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000085&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Double post, I know..<P>but I am to lazy to edit..<P>out of what I have so far read I want to answer these..<P>Time travel - For the guy who talked about points,lines,planes, space, and time. Nice idea but it lacks an explanation of the arrow of time. Why do we see a past and present and not just "left time" and "right time". Just something you might want to think about. <BR>-------------------------------------------<BR>True, but I am getting into what we preceive as time.. which is.. the movement of events..<P>Time should be able to move in any direction.. what is what we call timelines..<P>past present future determine what order of events.. but if you move the present all of a sudden your future is to the "left" or "right" of the other future in the path..<P>"right" and "left" siginifies other time lines.... and that gets into what I was saying about the 5th dimension.. it changes the effective direction in which time was going.<P>------------------------------------------<P>For example ... temperature. If something is cold, is that the absence of heat? Or is heat the absence of cold? When something is 'cold', what has changed? Does it have increased 'mass' in one of those not-perceiveable dimensions? Or is it lacking that mass (ie., being the absence of heat).<P>-----------------------------------------<P>Aye, but cold is a term that should not be used.. since cold isn't what travels.. it is the kenetic energy(heat) that moves..<P>By placing something cold next to something hot... the heat transfers to the cold..<P>Now of course comes the arguement that the cold was expended to slow down the kenetic energy in the hot object to make it cold but since the cold left the cold object that object heats up..<P>For that, I ask you to convert radiant energy into "cold" or absent kenetic energy..<P>Or better yet, convert absent radiant energy into "cold" or absent kenetic energy.<P>-------------------------------------------<BR>the light passed through the sheet & collided with a surface on the opposite side, which helped to support the idea that light moves 'in and out' of our perceiveable dimension<BR>--------------------------------------------<P>There is a LARGE amount of space between atoms.. Take gas, light travels through a gas without hitting it..<BR>The reason light traveled through that object and not gold is because the density of that object is little compared to the density of gold...<P>Now the candels of light energy can change how much it can go through an object..<P>Try this..<BR>Take a shirt and hold it to the light.. see the light going through it.. well it works sort of like a chainlink fence.. if you put yourself next to the fence.. it blocks out less than if you were far away..<P>now take the shirt and hold it about 20 ft back from the light.. how much is passing through it now?<P>It isn't that light is in another dimension.<P>Light just more light can travel through a less dense object than a more dense one..<P>I.E.<P>Light passes through steam better than it does water.<P>--------------------------------------------<P>Hey, here's a new idea, this could be very evil also...<BR>If you DID accelerate to the speed of light, any particle with mass (that is able to be measured and isnt under .1) you hit in space would basically kill you instantly, it would be like being shot with a sniper rifle at point blank range. So basically, if light has a mass, no matter what....and you smashed into like light when it wasnt all streched out all over the universe, wouldnt it smack you into oblivion or form you into a black hole?<P>-------------------------------------------<P>No, it bounces off you.. take your shirt..<P>Measure the mass of a photon..<P>Even travelling at the speed of light.. it has very little momentum..<P>When you get that small, you travel as a particle and a wave.. which leads me to beleive we travel as a wave, but are to large to measure it.. (at least with our equipment)..<P>but that's another point not relavent to this one.<P><BR>-------------------------------------------<BR>So far there's only one example for it, but a scientist has located a star at the outskirts of our galaxy that from all outward appearances is *speeding up*. They believe that this is an indication that our universe is continually expanding, however I'm more of the opinion that this star has traveled so far outside of the gravitational pull of the center of our universe, that another universe not perceiveable may have actually interfered with this sun, which explains it's accelerated rate.<BR>-------------------------------------------<P>I actually heard of something unexpentantly changing from red shift to a blue shift..<P>which means it is now coming towards us..<P>(/Explanation of that.)<P>When you travel and emit light or sound.. or other energy, it compacts in your front and expands in your back..<P>Much like this<P>                 tavelling -&gt;<BR>(      (     (     (    (   O))))<P><BR>Now in color, Red is a long wavelength (the back) and Blue is shorter (the front)<P>So if it changes from red to blue, it means that the object is coming towards us instead of away from us.<P>(/end explanation)<P>and we have no reason to explain it..<P>however, I cannot remember where I heard this from, and can not prove it's truth..<P>but I do remember when this happened people believed it was the bounary of the universe...<P><BR>*sigh*... that was barely worthy of posting...<P>------------------------------------------<P>Aeon - Thank you for the input of #3.. but we didn't need #1 or #2..<P>it is sience.. and not everyone believes in your god or other spiritual ideals.. lets keep this on a scientific matters.. we can start a religious flame war elsewhere.<P><BR>----------------------------------------<BR>(because supposedly black holes have a point about the size of an atom or a molecule. So, they said they sent the camera in, and they have no idea what the hell happened to it, as when they got a picture again (about 3 days after they sent it in) <P>---------------------------------------------<BR>two things..<P>black holes have singularities.... that is infinately small.. because it is a 0th dimensional object..<P>(at least as far as the current theory)<P><BR>and by sent it in.. I hope you don't mean actually sending it..<P>We don't have the technology to do that.. especailly not in your lifetime had we sent anything with infinate fuel using our current means of conventional engines.<P>and uhh.. we have pictures of blackholes.. and there is nothing of timetravel in them.. so if by sent in you meant take a snapshot..<P>near blackhole is more than 5 lightyears..<P>closest star is 4 lightyears away...<P><BR>--------------------------<P>This is as far as I got.. once again I must flee away... friends are dragging me out.. but.. i'll get to the rest later.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000089&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Phantal,<P>You have some nice ideas, but you need to brush up on your physics a bit.  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"> I know some of the statements in your post are from quotes and are not yours, but all those dashed lines got a little confusing to the eye so I responded to everything...<P>1) The repeating nature of the closed universe threory is only one interpretation. It may just as easily complete one cycle and forever disappear.<P>2) By definition there can only one universe (perhaps you mean galaxy?) Also, there is no "center" to our universe to be far away from. To say there is a center is to imply an outside reference point, which by definition does not exist.<P>3) Light can be bent by gravity, and it can be bent when passing through matter (e.g. glass) but the speed of photons do not change only the wave nature is affected.<P>4) Forces - There are four known forces. Gravitation, Electromagnetic, Strong Nuclear and Weak Nuclear. Temperature and light are not forces. Since three of these forces are well understood in that they act through an intermediary particle (i.e. photon, gluon, W or Z boson) saying they are just labels for something unknown in another dimension is a bit of overkill. We can't claim to properly understand gravity though as I stated in a previous post.<P>5) Protons, neutrons and electrons do not have a tendency to form atoms larger than Hydrogen (1 proton + 1 electron). Hydrogen forms from simple electromagnetic attraction between the two oppositely charged particles. Larger atoms only form when Hydrogen is fused under a significant gravitational force (i.e. a star's core). So there is no mysterious force at work here creating atoms.<P>6) The latter part of your post talks about multiple dimensions and is too theoretical (or perhaps philosophical) for me to comment on, except for the last statement about experiments demonstrating light passing through "solid" matter. I'm afraid no special extra dimensions are needed to explain this behavior as "solid matter" is mostly empty space and this kind of behavior is not unusual. A neutrino can pass through a 500-light year thick bar of solid lead without hitting anything, but that's normal.<P>Please don't take these comments negatively. I am enjoying this thread, but a lot of people throw out concepts like parallel universes (which is really a horrible name: First off they would be part of our universe not separate, and they would technically be perpendicular, not parallel) as if they are proven. It seems to me that most people are unable to separate what they "want" to believe from what is really in front of them, and they twist words like "universe" and "time" and "dimension" to meanings that suit them when in fact they never understood what these things stood for in the first place. For instance, take the word universe - By definition it means "everything" so you cannot go "outside" of it and you cannot have more than one. People watch to much sci-fi and pick up this crap and try to pass it off as science. If you want to talk about a separate region of spacetime connected to ours thorugh a higher dimension, fine, but don't call it another universe. In fact it better be connected somehow because if it isn't, and it is in fact "impossible" to pass information between the two, then it becomes meaningless to say it exists. The same goes for Jafo's comment on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, that certain pairs of properties cannot be measured together. Jafo said that of course both exist even though they can't be measured (a deterministic view). But the important point is that if it is impossible to measure them both then it is MEANINGLESS to say they both exist. Whether they do or not has ZERO impact on the rest of the universe and THAT is the true point of the uncertainty principle.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000090&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Ohso--<P>&gt; The ship neads only to expend more thrust than the opposing<BR>&gt; gravitaional force and can leave at any speed it can manage,<BR>&gt; 1MPH, 1000MPH, it doesn't matter.<P>Thrust is only created by pushing something away from you.  Ever heard the phrase, "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction"?  This is the nature of thrust.  In pushing something away from yourself, you push yourself away from it at the same time.  Usually you're pushing some nasty hot crap away from you at high speed, and thus accelerating yourself in the opposite direction.<P>At the event horizon, you need to be *accelerating* (not moving) away from the singularity at the speed of light, because that is the rate at which the force of gravity is accelerating you towards the singularity.  However, since you cannot push anything (of a similar mass to your own craft) away from yourself at the speed of light, you will not be escaping.<P>Nice try, no cigar.<P>---<P>Gulzin--<P>I am still not terribly interested in talking to you.  Go read some books on determinism and think carefully about it.<P>Here is a synopsis.<P>I assume that, at any given time, the current state of the universe, and *only* that state, *fully* implies the immediately-following state of the universe.  All effects *must* come directly from causes, so nothing will happen in the immediately-following state which was not caused by the current state.  Therefore, one could examine the following state (from outside the box, so to speak) and fully reconstruct the current state by retracing all causes back to their effects.<P>In short, state T implies state T+1, and state T+1 implies state T.  Slide T around the timeline all you want, there is no time at which it isn't true.  Make +1 as small or large as you like, but the "following" state is still fully implied by the current state.<P>There is no infinitely-branching tree of choices.  At any time, there is only one choice, one state, which may immediately follow the current, and it is fully implied *by* the current.  No matter how many times you try it, you will always get the same following state out of the current state.<P>Now replace the word "implied" with "determined", which you should, and determinism will be your daddy.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Jafo (edited 06-19-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000091&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Quote "At the event horizon, you need to be *accelerating* (not moving) away from the singularity at the speed of light, because that is the rate at which the force of gravity is accelerating you towards the singularity. However, since you cannot push anything (of a similar mass to your own craft) away from yourself at the speed of light, you will not be escaping."<P>Not true at all. You do not have to be moving at the speed of light (and accelerating at the speed of light doesn't even make sense). The force between you and the singularity is defined by the product of your masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between you. This amount will be a finite force until you reach the singularity itself. Given that F=Ma, the acceleration on you would also be finite. If you can produce that amount of acceleration, you can move away from the singularity. What you use to produce that acceleration is your problem (I didn't say it was easy, only theoretically possible).<P>In fact I can envision a simple arrangement where it might even be *easy*.<P>Example:<P>Imagine a ship in close orbit to the event horizon. It is going near light speed and holding orbit. (Lightspeed is the required velocity to hold orbit at the event horizon, so just outside it a slightly slower speed would do)<BR>Now imagine that ship dipping down into the horizon, the near lightspeed velocity is no longer enough to maintain orbit and it would ,unassisted, begin a death spiral into the singularity. Now below the horizon imagine the ship (in addition to its formidable velocity) adds an upward thrust. It's exhaust doesn't have to move at lightspeed or anything strange like that to produce a finite amount of thrust(any reaction has an equal an opposite reaction).<BR>Now since the ship crossed the horizon does it experience an infinite pull? No. The amount of increase in gravity is simply releated to the difference in distance between the ship and the singularity. This amount is finite, and in fact could be quite small with a very large hole and helped by a closely calculated orbit.<BR>The fact of the matter is the event horizon is nothing really special. It is the point of no return for freefalling matter, but not for matter undergoing acceleration. I know the physics of this are correct and am not merely speculating. I am simply pointing out yet another fact of "bad science" that we get spoonfed from TV and Media everyday.<P>Additional:  There are some qualifications to all of this...One the black hole must be rotating (otherwise the internal reversing of time and space axes will prevent you from leaving anyway) and secondly since the extreme gravity will dilate time, you will probably get to see the universe die while still on the way in...What's there when you come out, who knows...<p>[This message has been edited by Ohso (edited 06-19-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000095&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Ohso--<P>&gt; What you use to produce that acceleration is your problem<BR>&gt; (I didn't say it was easy, only theoretically possible).<P>I'm sorry, that's an unacceptable cop-out.  There is only one way in this universe to accelerate, and that is by pushing something away from you (or by being pushed, which is really the same thing).  As soon as you wave your hands in the air and say "I don't care how you do it," you are throwing your argument in the trash.  "Theoretically possible" requires a theory based on reason.<P>Also, at the event horizon, it is NOT adequate to be *orbiting* near the speed of light.  You must be *accelerating perpendicular* to the event horizon at the speed of light in order to escape, because acceleration due to gravity is perpendicular also but in the opposite direction.<P>And finally, "accelerate at/by the speed of light" is a reasonable thing to say.  One accelerates in units of distance per time unit per time unit.  For instant, you accelerate (due to gravity) towards earth at about 9.81 meters per second, per second.  So, to accelerate at or by the speed of light, you would be accelerating by 300,000,000 meters per second, per second.  And that, I believe, *is* the acceleration due to gravity is at the event horizon of a black hole, but I could be wrong on that point.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000099&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I couldn't find any of my books that described this, and it's been well over a year since I've thought about this, but if I remember right...<P>As an observer A (that has mass) approaches the event horizon, the force needed to remain outside the event horizon approaches infinity.  It is something like trying to climb a wall by applying force horizontally while the wall is sloping upwards more and more to the point of becoming vertical.  Inside the event horizon, there is no straight line in spacetime (keeping in mind that the path light takes defines a straight line) that leads back through the event horizon; and since A cannot travel as fast as light, his path in spacetime is restricted by the "light cone" formed by all paths light can take passing through A's location, he cannot pass back out of the event horizon either.<P>From the reference frame of an observer B that remains outside the event horizon, A never makes it to the event horizon.  Instead A appears to slow down, and light reflected from A arriving back at B becomes more and more redshifted as the light has less and less energy (since light travels at a constant speed, rather than losing kinetic energy when travelling "against" gravity as an object in freefall with mass would, it loses energy by having an increased wavelength).  As the time passed for B approaches infinity, A approaches the event horizon and the light from B approaches zero energy.<P>Some other very odd things are predicted by our models, but I probably shouldn't attempt to describe them without reading about them again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000100&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Oh, I should mention that many of the incorrect ideas are a result of thinking about a black hole in Newtonian terms...Newtonian physics is an approximation that provides acceptably close results in most everyday cases, but breaks down in extreme situations (like near a black hole).  General relativity is a much closer approximation that, as far as we can tell, handles things like black holes well; however it (like Newtonian physics) only works on a macroscopic level.  An exact model that also works on the atomic or subatomic level would need to include quantum theory, if I remember right.  Of course then the calculations get so messy that you can't get many useful results on the macroscopic level in a reasonable amount of time...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000101&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Again I say that to "accelerate at the speed of light" is meaningless. Can I accelerate at 300,000 m/s^2 for half a second? Of course, in the end I will still be moving at less than the speed of light. In fact there is no upper limit to acceleration unless you accept the planck time as the smallest unit of time in which case the limit of acceleration would be seem to be 600,000m/plancktime^2 (impossible to achieve, but you could get as close as you like), but you seem not to like the tenets of Quantum theory.<P>Anyway after doing some more reasearch I don't believe it is possible anymore, but for completely different reasons than the ones you give. It would seem there are some relativistic effects at work that would make escape impossible.(***added*** It seems that Melchior posted these same thoughts while I was composing this) Interestingly enough, my calculations (***added*** yes they are Newtonian, which is where the problem would lie) keep coming back that it is possible. Lets consider some numbers:<P>One mega black hole :<BR>Mass equal to 10 billion suns = 1.99x10^40kg<BR>Schwarzchild Radius is then = 29.5 billion km<P>One human :<BR>Mass = 80kg<P>Force of gravity at schwarzchild radius (event horizon) = GM1M2/r^2 = 122,018 Newtons<P>So the force is equivalent to about 155.5 'g' forces. Certainly fatal for this idiot, but not above possibility for a robotic probe. ***added*** I would like to see the relativistic equations for this same situation, and how they vary from the newtonian. Melchior can you do them?<P>***additional-additional*** It's funny, I know how relativity affects objects moving near the speed of light, and how it changes the nature of space-time inside a black hole, but it hadn't occured to me that the force of gravity would be greater than that predicted by newtonian physics *outside* the hole. I wonder at what point the effects become fairly noticable, e.g. the relativistic effects of high velocity aren't largely noticable until .75c or so.<p>[This message has been edited by Ohso (edited 06-20-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000102&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>[late night rambling]<P>Unfortunately the equations have long since slipped my mind; I can only remember some of the conclusions drawn from them.  I'll have to hope someone with a stronger physics background will be able to verify/refine/refute/whatever my claims, unless I can dig up my old astrophysics or relativity books.  They're probably buried under a bunch of computer science books that I opened maybe once or twice...<P>I vaguely remember an equation specific to (non-rotating) black holes where the denominator went to zero at the Schwarzchild (sp?) radius, which was related to the event horizon somehow...though this would be for an idealized situation, as black holes _should_ rotate simply from conservation of angular momentum.  I also remember rotation caused some strange things to happen with the model of a black hole--the singularity is no longer a point but a ring shape, and passing through the ring should lead to a "white hole" that is equivalent to a black hole reversed in time--nothing can enter the white hole, not even light.  Light becomes infinitely blue-shifted as it travels outwards, curving spacetime around it, etc.  Interesting stuff with absolutely no practical applications or (so far) experimental verification...mostly a mathematical exercise. :)<P>Heh, somehow appropriate that I learned this from research for a philosophy class...<P>Oh, and I've played Chrono Trigger with both zsnes and snes9x, after having played through it on the actual console.  Both worked just fine, though I seem to remember only one drawing the mists properly (the other left them opaque, so that I had to turn off that layer to be able to see).  Of course I'm sure both have come a long way since I used them.<P>[/late night rambling]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000105&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Another thought...I think part of the problem is that gravity is not actually a force but a result of the geometry of spacetime, which can usually be approximated as a force in flat spacetime, but not near a black hole (where Newtonian physics breaks down).<P>Or something like that.

</FONT><HR>I mentioned the same thing on page 2. Einstein thought that gravity was simply the bending of spacetime and not really a force. I know there are lots of differences in the models for rotating vs. non-rotating black holes including the ring singularity. Rotating black holes also have two event horizons, and inner and an outer. It is theoretically possible to enter and exit the outer event horizon if you enter properly. You are right about there probably not being any such thing as a non-rotating black hole.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000107&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Ok...<P>If you traveled and say twice the times of light for 20 "years".  I say years loosely, being the amount of time it takes the earth to travel 20 rotations or the earth around the sun (not accounting every 1/4 extra "day" for leap years).  Anyway, if you outrun the light that has hit the earth and is reflected, you could use look at that light after you out-ran it and therefore kinda see what happened in the past. <P>in other words, light is reflected off the earth today.  You get on a space shuttle and travel faster than that light.  Out-run that light at such a distance that you could eventually "look" (when it arrives to you) at that light and see what happened the day you left.  <P>Now, if we traveled at some crazy speed (say 100+ times the speed of light) we would eventually catch up to light that was reflected 100 million days ago.  Out-run that light just enough where when it caught up to you, you could see it.  Therefore, you can actually see how the dinosaurs lived (just as a cheesy example).  That I believe is the closed thing to observing the past that you can do.  Including time travel (well maybe not after some of these posts)...<P>now that i read this.. i think that it would probably be impossible to view light that left the earth 100 million years ago because we couldn't predict where that light would end up.  After traveling such a distance, that light probably would have been effected by gravitational forces and "distort" the path of the light.  Or maybe light disperses, but in space i don't think it does... like it does in non-vacum volume (ie, earth's atmosphere, or air).  Well actually "space" isn't a complete vacuum.  Well, i'm not educated enought to even post this but i will anyway cause it made me think and i feel like posting it   =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000111&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002837-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002837.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002837-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=002837&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=002837&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
