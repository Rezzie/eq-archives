</FONT><HR>Frankly, I think this bites big time. I spent a lot of time setting up a laptop specifically for this purpose, compiled ShowEQ, got the dang thing running, actually GOT some data - and then it crashed when a friend buffed me. Now I can't get back to where I was.<P>If some folk have this thing running properly, why not share the information and lets see if we can work together on keeping it running amonst us. <P>I've tried multiple variations of libEQ.a and everquest.h files. I'm going back to the basics to see if I canget this running again. I do know, that yesterday, I had problems getting in around 4:30pm CST. the EQmain.DLL was reported as having problems. Ironically, after 10 minutes or so of trying, I got a patch from EQ and it started to work. I also noticed that the location of some of the files changed THAT DAY. <P>Could someone explain if any ShowEQ works and if so, is there some kinda wait (5 minutes, 10 minutes, etc) before it starts to kick in?<P>I've got a small group up at work who have "elected" me to be the one to run ShowEQ and lead the pack. I kinda feel like I'm letting them down now. <P>I'm no hot-shot programmer but I don't mind learning this libEQ.a if someone could give me more of a clue what to look for. <P>If anyone is truely interested in getting together and working on this, then lets do it! My ICQ # is available in my profile. <P>IMO - Screw Ratt, you just betrayed a group of people who were significantly interested in ShowEQ and left us holding the bag with nothing. You've not only wasted a lot of OUR time but posted a bunch of PR (public relation) bullsh*t to cover you ass. I ain't buying it and I doubt a lot of other intelligent folks aren't either.<BR>/em gives Ratt the finger.<P>Peace</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002490.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=ShowEQ&TopicSubject=So+what+are+we+going+to+do|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Well, to the reply above this one. First, I read many of the posts and replies. From what I've noticed, I probably have more capability getting most programs to run under Linux because I've used it for a decent amount of time. You won't find me asking how to delete a directory structure or how to TAR or GZIP or whatever. Either way I *DID* get the damn thing working. <P>To Ratt:<BR>Well, you can be as self-rightious as you wish. You create a trend, support it and you gain recognition for it. Sincere interest grows, then you go and get a moral about what it is you are doing. You could probably even make a decent payback for all your wonderful work if you asked for a "subscription" to receive updates. For those who are serious about the game and the utility, the would HAPPILY donate to your case (if that hasn't already taken place). <P>It's my opinion and I REPEAT, *my opinion* that the reasons for not continuing to support this software or helping other to learn how to do it on their own (and I'm NOT sifting through an ungodly amount of posts for those jewels when someone who is truly organized would create an appropriate document for such a feat) and then the burden is lifted from your shoulders. The problem I see here is that this work seems to be SOMEWHAT shrouded in mystery and lame responses to sincere questions. <P>If you had any qualms about creating such a piece of work, perhaps you shouldn't have undertaken it. Now, you have followers (or straglers, however you wish to see it) and you've closed the door on them. SURE I think they have a right to be upset. I've known about SEQ for some time and tried to get it working once in the past when it wouldn't even TRACK my own character (properly). And sure, it IS a waste of *MY* time when I take a perfectly working Dell laptop, with Win2K Pro on it, blow away the OS and put RH7.2, then download the software, it doesn't work, so I do the RIGHT thing and read posts so as to not bother the "elite" with idiot questions, then learn that THAT week, the author isn't supporting it any longer. Well CRAP. There are more folks interested in me getting this done then just my own desire to have an edge in the game. <P>I'm not saying guilt should lie in your heart or something like that. I just took the time to create a proper environment specifically for your wonderful creation (no sarcastic intent) and then get let down because it looks like you had a change of heart. Folks need to play the game the right way, it's not fair to the rest of the players. <P>Well, this isn't a competition against ME and the other players. If they want to play "by the rules" then more power to them. In life, you take all the breaks that come your way, otherwise you waste your precious time..This is a competition between time and myself. I'd like to spend LESS time trying to get somewhere (this probably applies to most people in life about just everything). <P>So I took the steps to figure this out and I got SEQ running without asking anyone any questions. <P>Ratt: You also replied saying your wasted MY time, if you re-read the significant part, I say you wasted OUR time, the time of the folks who set out to use this tool and can't get it to work because of the hodge-podge of libEQ.a files that will now be floating all over the place while user frantically scramble to try to get it to work. <P>I do agree with you, the world doesn't owe me shit. It wasn't my intention to make you think you owe ME anything. I would figure you owe it to your "followers" or "crowd" or whatever you wish to call them. <P>If you would, explain this to me though..what do you mean that I am the type of person who would not use SEQ responsibly? What is responsible/irresponsible use of this software? It would be irresponsible of me to shout (or OOC) to others that ShowEQ rules. It would be irresponsible of me to flaunt it in front of EQ. I wish the product to LIVE, and the less Veriant knows about it, the better. Do I use it for an "edge" in the game, well, HELL YES! To I tell anyone I do not know that I am? Hell no...so, what do you mean by implying that I wouldn't use it in a responsible manner?<P>I like your response, sounds like you are reasonable and mature (except for the cursing../grin).<P>Anyway, It's time to get in the game. I just wanted to see what replies I got on this post. Apparently there are more supporters of you not supporting SEQ then there are folks who are interested in seeing it live on. Well, whatever..I'm in the wrong crowd then.<P>Neologic</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002490.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=ShowEQ&TopicSubject=So+what+are+we+going+to+do|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Ahh, I see where your misconception of the whole project lies, which is tainting your view of the whole thing ...<P>You, and other I'm quite sure, are under the mistaken impression that I'm doing it for "others", whoever they may be.  I won't speak for any of the other developers, but personally, I do it for me.  Perhaps that is a bit selfish, but it's a fact, none the less.  I contribute my code and organize others, and keep everything running for my own personal gratification.  If someone else gets use out of it, it's just _THAT_ much better ... but if no one used SEQ, besides the developers, it would go on getting developed.  Perhaps privately, perhaps publically ... but we each build of someone elses work, and we each learn from others.  Centralizing a software repository and making it publically available furthers this goal ... people have ways of looking at a problem, or finding a solution, or just making neat gadgets that one person alone may never think of ... so you have a richer piece of software for it.  <P>You are not the first person to bring up the "Charge a subscription" for updates concept.  I will never, ever, ever do that.  I will not accept any money, and I would hope none of the other developers would accept money for that.  Now... pizza and perhaps beer... but not money.  Papa Johns is my fav if anyone is reading  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I, of course, do not know you and have to base my crazy opinions on what I do know of you.  When I say you are probably one of the people using, or would use SEQ irresponsibly, I refer to what I have always said, since day one.  SEQ is not a tool for farming, and it most certainly NOT a tool for Ebay farming.  The current SEQ project is intended for navigation as it's primary function, and also to serve as a C3 device.  There are other functions that it can be put to use, and some will use these in an irresponsible manner.  Obviously, I view farming items as a definite no-no.  Grey areas are camping that rare spawn, once.  (Stormfeather anyone?) ... ridiculous camps like that, I believe are acceptable for the most part... if you are doing it just to further yourself along and not take away from others.  Finding corpses / lost people / etc...  Those things don't necessarily hurt anyone, and obviously help some, and argueably add something to the game that already SHOULD be there.<P>SEQ defintely needs to be used for large scale encounters for organization and control.  EQ was not designed, or poorly designed to handle what the majority of the game actually is to a lot of people, large scale guild raids.  There's no provisions for communication between guilds, or organizing large numbers of people, sending out scouts (and having them be able to report back that information in a meaningful and timely manner), precision strikes ... all things that should, would and could be accomplished in a more robust gaming environment.  <P>I realize some people will disagree with me on this... suprise!  However, that's the way I see it.  I believe that there are some encounters in the game that would be next to impossible without SEQ, and the only reason they are being done now is specifically BECAUSE SEQ exists.  <P>I think most people have come to accept the fact that SEQ is not designed for, nor intended for the neophite audience.  To put it plainly, I do not want you using this software if you are unable to setup a Linux system and get it running. All these "how-to" guides are a bad thing (tm) IMHO.  I wish they didn't exist, but they do, and that's fine.  As a general rule of thumb, those that are familiar with linux and able to navigate around within it are going to be far, far more responsible than JoeWindowsUser who installs Linux just to use SEQ, and doesn't know the first thing about any of the processes behind it.  JoeAverageWindowsUser is irresponsible, ignorant, and generally cares nothing for his fellow online gamers.  <P>You say I'm going and "getting moral" all of a sudden (or you imply this), this is patently not the case.  I have ALWAYS tried to keep SEQ as close to "on the level" as I could, given the nature of the beast.  This latest move is just an extention of that, the only difference is it is more visible and effects more vocal people than anything else.  <P>Could the situation have been handled better?  You bet.  But, the situation degenerated into what we have here, so I have to deal with the reality of the situation, and not what-if's.  <P>SEQ will be back, as I've said before, all the co-dependant people that rely on SEQ will have thier fix again soon enough.  It's just a matter of having patients and not needing to screw your fellow gamers over so quickly.  I suspect all those yelling the loudest are the ones that really shouldn't be using SEQ in the first place.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002490.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=ShowEQ&TopicSubject=So+what+are+we+going+to+do|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Ratt,<P>You're incredible. You can take someone like myself who is hacked off at the situation. Explain your side in an intelligent, quiet manner...and calm down the aggressor (me). Wow. <P>You know what. I think I owe you an apology...<BR>So, I apologize. What you have said makes sense and seems to come from the heart. If you lived near me, I'd buy you some pizza, beer and ask you to tell me more about SEQ.<P>As far as the "how to's"...well, I had to learn a bit about it that way. In my case I had absolutely NO mentor and had to look at some of those how-to's forwards and backwards to understand what was going on. <P>I thought about editting out my original post but perhaps it should remain so others can see our points of view and realize more what and why you did the SEQ thing. <P>If I understood more about EQ and your programming of SEQ, I'd love to get involved. Unfortunately, my profession is network engineering and I've spent more time with routers and switches and LAN/WAN topologies then in any kind of programming langauge (it's about the only thing I lack in my computer expertise). <P>Excellent response.<P>Best Regards,<P>Neologic</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002490.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=ShowEQ&TopicSubject=So+what+are+we+going+to+do|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">
