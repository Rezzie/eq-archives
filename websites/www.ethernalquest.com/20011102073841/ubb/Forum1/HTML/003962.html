</FONT><HR>I have the solution.  We as americans should no longer extend our freedom to imigrants, instead we close our boarders to foreigners.  We then systematically destroy all foreign races in America.  We then stop funding other countries.  We take our troops out of all other countries.  we then defend only our country.  hell dont we financially support 90% of the military in the world anyways?  but seriously now.  why is it when EVERY other fuckn country on this god damn planet has a crisis who is the first to help them?  and look at this, we have the biggest crisis in American history and whose rushing to help us?  instead we got idiot motherfuckers on this board and MANY more accross the U.S. that thinks the we deserve this...  FUCK!  wheres your fuckn Turbin asshole?  get the fuck out of my country!  thats exactly what Sadam had to say about this too.  And those who say bin Laden is justified in killing over 5000 innocent Americans, obviously dont have a fuckn clue.  Are you a Terrorist to?  Do we need to hunt your ass down or walk up in your home loaded with guns killing your unsuspecting family?  nope.  what if i declare war on your ass.  fine, i declare war on your ass!  i said it.  now does that mean im justified in whiping out your entire unsuspecting race/family/country.  so that i dont have the FBI at my door in the next day or so, this should have been completely obvious anyways, i was being saracstic.  Although this is how i feel, im not going to walk around killing people because their views are slightly different...like a muslim.  fuck i gotta go, im getting seriously pissed just thinking about this.  im out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR> 2white? WHat's with having to create a new ID? Afraid your soapbox rantings will not go over well and don't want anyone to know who you really are?<P> I agree with a good portion of what you said, which really scares me, because if you had said all that 2 weeks ago I would have been flaming the hell out of you for being a bigot. Hell, you still are a bigot, but now I am one too I guess. I just word it a bit differently when I say it, you're a bit more extreme than I am.<P>  I'm all for closing the borders, and have been against all this damn foreign aid shit for years.<BR>  The US should be taking care of it's own first, then helping out the neighbors, unless it's a mutual aid thing.<BR>  If I have a barn to build and 3 of my neighbors have barns to build, I'll be glad to help them, as long as they are helping me when my turn comes, but I'll be damned if I let my cows stand in the rain while I just keep on helping the neighbors, investing my time, and resources on them with no regard to my own and then, when I do finally build my barn, do you REALLY think I'm gonna let the neighbors put their stock in it while I leave mine out in the elements?<P>  That's the US of A I'm talking about though, rush off and help the other countries, while the US has homeless folks, some of them children, living in the gutters. Uneducated folks running around because they can't afford to go to school to better themselves, while we allow foreigners to come over and the US government gives them grant money to get that diploma. <P>  So yea, stop letting them in the country unless they are here on vacation, or here on business for companies in their own country. Stop giving US dollars to feed them, clothe them, educate them, house them, stop giving away OUR tax dollars until OUR people are taken care of. When no more of our children go to bed hungry, or walk around barefoot, or sleep in a box in the alley, THEN and only then, look around and see who needs our help.<BR>  As for the military situation... why the hell would I want my son to go defend another country and possibly lose his life to fight for something he doesn't believe in, just because the leaders of the opposing countries can't agree on how to spell their deity's name! <BR>  Nope, I'm an isolationist now, more thn I ever was before, 'cause if it was being done my way, those hijackers never would have been in the US any damn way, and they sure wouldn't have been rataliating over some imagined slight because we hads tuck our nose in what they felt was not our business.<P>  I might not feel this way again in a month, but right now I sure as hell do.<P>      Fineas<BR>"Oh, Bother" said Pooh as he emptied a full clip into bin Laden's scrawny torso.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

I was just trying to make a point.  If we are pushy assholes for promoting peace, what are we if we cut off all other countries from our funding and stop allowing them the freedom to come to our country?  suddenly were are.....well instead of nosey assholes, we are stingy assholes.  we cant win.

</FONT><HR>A flame war... horray?<P>I doubt I should respond to this. Every time I try to set out with an open mind and a good approach, it turns into a flame war, the topic doesn't matter. And with this big a topic... ouch.<P>But responding in general. I think I can manage that. First, I want to make abundantly clear a few things about my stance.<P>1) I am not intending to continue the flame.<BR>2) I am not a terrorist, no.<BR>3) I do NOT think that bin Laden (if he was responsible, I have heard no evidence or proof, only conjecture) was justified in killing people.<BR>4) I do not think ANYONE is EVER justified in killing people, NO MATTER the reason.<BR>5) I like spam. The food, not the other kind. I hate the other kind.<P>Ok. Now, to respond more specifically to your points.<P>1) Closing your borders to immigrants would only elevate the problem. People all over the world would resent you even more. Also, removing the inscription on the Statue of Liberty would be expensive.<BR>2) No, you don't support 90% of the military world-wide. Not even 80%. Or 70% hell, probably not even 40%. If you did, I would recommend you to scrap it (which I do anyway).<BR>3) Yes, PLEASE take your troops out of all other countries. That would go a long way to creating peace across the globe.<BR>4) When every other "fuckn" country across the world has a problem, who is the first to help them? I don't know. I think that it is different in each case. How helped Afghanistan first? Who helped Palestine first? Heck, who helped Poland, France, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Russia when they were invaded in WWII first? It was NOT the USA. It was other European countries, or Russia.<BR>5) You think you have the biggest crisis in American history now? Read up on history. Read about the Civil War, read about the Independance War, read about Pearl Harbour. <BR>6) "Turbin"?<BR>7) I am not quite understanding your point here. You are trying, and suceeding, to be sarcastic when saying that if you declare war on me, you are justified in walking into my home and killing my unsuspecting family. This is true. That would not be justification. But then, was declaring war on Japan justification enough for dropping not one, but TWO atomic bombs on it?<BR>8) Maybe YOU don't walk about killing people because their views are slightly different, but many Americans have and are. You killed Nazis, you killed Muslims, you killed Arabs, "witches", "communists", "niggers", need I go on?<BR>(you above meant USA-americans in general). Instead, YOU (still generalising, but this time with more justification) discriminate against them. <BR>Note that I am looking mainly at US history here. Contemporary history, but history nonetheless.<P>I am NOT in any way, advocating murder. I am NOT in any way, advocating facism or nazi tendencies. I am NOT, in any way, advocating totalitarian, fundamentalistic or otherwise irrational, dangerous behaviour.<P>What I am trying to say is that the US still has problems, and should try to fix those before blundering into places with guns ablaze. I am also trying to say that VIOLENCE IS NOT THE ANSWER! Not to this problem, nor to ANY OTHER. Always negotiate first. If that fails, negotiate some more. Then more, then more. Then try parleying. Then try negotiating. Then try surrendering. Heck, try everything, EXCEPT VIOLENCE.<P>Have I got my point across without flaming? I hope so, I tried.<P>If you want me to clarify my stance, ok. I will. Just ask. Nicely.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Well when you steal all of North America, then once you are all here having pushed all the American Indians away, then you steal half of Mexico. Wtf do you expect but for the country to be diverse, I mean why don't you go back to Europe if you don't like it (Assuming that you are white). I mean I'm white too, but I don't complain about helping other people. Not to offend you southerners, but I am guessing you live in a southern state?

</FONT><HR> I never said don't help at all, what I said was take care of your own first, then take care of other folks.<BR> As for land taken from the Indians, it happened, we dealt with it, 2 of my grandparents grew up on reservations, so did their parents. No it wasn't right, and yes, what was done to their ancestors does compare sometimes to what was done in New York and DC, with the exception of the fact that my ancestors KNEW who their enemy was, and KNEW they were at war.<P>  So no, my saying we should take care of Americans first and everyone else after our own are okay is not a thing I will retract. My wife works int he social services office here in Pinellas County, Florida. Everyday she has folks coming in that are on the rolls, having their bills paid, thier groceries bought, their rent paid, and they are NOT Americans, but it is American tax money paying all those things for them, while somewhere there are American children going hungry. <BR>  A line has to be drawn somewhere. and I personally think now is the time.

</FONT><HR>Sohn, I have a few words for you. One addressed to your middle eastern propaganda aimed at inflaming the world. The other towards what you think is America.<P>From what I gather about people like you, and other middle eastern ideologist is that you believe that America is out to impose on ideals central to Muslim belief. That is laughable attempt to poison minds of those who are ignorant to the truth. Yes, we have had many " mistaktes " in our campaigns to rid the world of corrupt people like Bin Ladin, but hell, what country hasn't? <P>The big difference here is that we make mistakes, we don't drive planes into buildings full of innocent people on purpose. Truthfully you cannot say the same for Muslim extremist. Its unfortunate that people like you represent Muslims because I know a few who would like to have your head for defending such horrific acts. <P>You say that we have done so many injustices to people in the world and only help when it's on OUR terms. I cannot disagree with that more. We had no reason to rebel against the south when African-americans were denied freedom, but those of us who disagreed gave countless lives to stop it. And if you tell me it was over land or money your just adding flame to your moronic stance. We never had to help the rest of the country when Hitler and Japan decided to kill everyone. We got involved when things started to look rough and sure, what difference would it make to you who controled the rest of the world, so long as you could control them. <P>People like you say we oppress everyone, yet we speak for everyone. The world is ours, because we fight for that fragile reward earned by many ancestors in death. The reward of freedom, we may kill in search of freedom but never for religion.<P>Then you tell me what Americans are, and who we represent. First off let me say that America is probably the biggest mix of race and culture in the world. Sure we are not perfect but as one who is engaged to a latino/persian woman I can say that I believe we are all equal. We are all citizens of this great country. Why do I say it's great? Well lets see, every other country would have hell to deliver on the kind of freedom we offer, and to open our doors to everyone. We have accomplished what might have seemed impossible centuries ago. WE might not be perfect but we are light years ahead of other countries in terms of social balance. And after this attack freind, let me tell you we have gained a world-wide advance in human relations with the acceptance from Pakistan to operate in their homeland. Soon the world will be free of blind ignorance and will know that we can survive amongst each other regardless of culture and have utmost repect. If you asked me what America is I would tell you the greatest country around, most intelligent and enlightened. I suppose its only natural for someone such as you to try to stain the honor of such  a tremendous country. <P>I'm done with you for now, I think these ideas are something that you'll probably look past and say I'm a fool. But then again thats what Osama bin Ladin would do as well.<p>[This message has been edited by AnGrY-EQ-FrEaK (edited 09-16-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000014&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I think I will probably get flamed for this post, but after reading some of the comments here, I can't help myself in replying.<P>First off, I know a lot of this is people letting off steam - totally understandable under the circumstances.<P>I am a member of the Australian military, and would just like to add some comments...<P>The United States is the greatest country on earth in terms of economic might and military power.  While I do not agree with everything the US does, I would much rather have them as the dominant power in the world than, let's say, China.<P>While I don't believe the US has a responsiblity to police the world, there is no other country capable of mounting military operations to the extent of the US - US political leaders also choose to maintain the foriegn policy your country has, and I am sure many other countries around the world would be happy if this stance was changed.  <P>If my country had the resources to do so, I would feel that we have a responsibility to oppose tyranny wherever we can, but of course doing this comes at a cost.  <P>Australia recently liberated East Timor from Indonesia under a UN sanctioned mission, and we have felt the negative aspects of taking a leading role in the region from our neighbours.  We also played a leading part in bringing a peace treaty to Papua New Guinea and Bouganville, supporting the Solomon Islands during their recent violence and Fiji through it's ongoing political instablity (alot of you probably have never even heard of these places) all without the help of the US - it's a much smaller scale than undertakings the US commits itself too, but hey, we only have 16 million people.<P>We have stood by America in every conflict she has been involved in, and died along side her troops on the battlefield.  My father was killed in Vietnam, and my Uncle in Korea.  <P>Right now the Australian military is actively contributing to relief efforts in the US with personnel and equipment (only 1 C130 at the moment).  Our government yesterday also commited us to fight alongside America in whatever upcoming action is taken, as we have done in the past.<P>We have an extremely multi-cultural society, and we also have freedom of speech - as does virtually every other country in the 1st world.<P>My reason for posting all of the above is just to point out that generalizations will never be correct - yes, as I said the US is the greatest country in the world and does a lot towards helping other countries, but most of us are trying to do all we can as well.  <P>My sympathy goes out to all touched by the recent events in the USA - although we are a small, pissant insignificant country out in the pacific in many of your eyes, Australia will be there to do what it can, as it always has been.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I feel sympathetic to your past Badbilly.<P>I too had many relatives who died and fought for forigners freedom. Keep in mind that the valor of your father and uncle will always keep them as heros in my eyes. <P>NEVER forget our cause, as a free world, to oppose tyrany. Although at times our methods seem a bit oberwhelming and miscalculated, we do it in good will towards the common man. It is our duty as the leading nation to leave a good example for other countries that peace will reign over chaos always. Even though we cannot keep some from the path of misguidance, we can  work together to keep them from gaining followers. <P>I myself am a non-believer. I believe that everyday we have should be cherished as though it were our last. People cannot ever forget that we might not see the light at the end of the tunnel. And if so, what would we regret in life to devote our lives, let alone our will, to a false belief. I'm not saying you shouldn't worship your gods. I'm just calling for an open perspective, consider that the gift you were given was to experiance anothers smile. Maybe perhaps to feel the ocean breeze on your skin or to observe a california sunset. Whatever the case, life is too short to be quarreled over to an extent such as this. I certainly hope when my day of passing comes I will see a free world where people of all beliefs realize that life comes before all else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Woah. Maybe I should stop posting now. I still have lots of arguments, and all of them are well thoght out. I am not some "middle eastern propagada spreader" as some of you try to make me out.<P>Some of you seem to think that the US is the only country in the world where people are free. I could not disagree more. Yes, it is the most powerfull economic, political and military force in the world. It is for that reason I think it should show more maturity than it has.<P>Badbilly, I could not agree more with what you have posted. I won't flame you for that, it was a very thoughfull post, filled with compassion and sparks no controversy here.<P>Angry-Eq-Freak, I think that you should take the trouble to read my post before flaming me so much. I also think that you should re-evaluate your stance on 1st world European countires. I come from Sweden, and we have more freedom than most counties here. Why you think that the US has more freedom and liberty than Sweden is beyond me. We have less unemployment, less crime, less idiots, than the US and have just as much right to live in this world as you do. <P>Another thing. Whyt does evryone seem to think that I am defending bin Laden? Have I ever said in any of my posts that it was right to crash the planes into the WTC or the Pentagon? No. Have I condemnded it, countless times. Yes. I have. <BR>Have I said that hat the muslims believe is the truth? No. I am very much against the some of the muslim beliefs, since I think they are deterimental to world peace.<P>You say that the US has made "mistakes". Like, bombing Libyan refugee camps for no reason? Waiting a couple of years before helping the free world in WWII? Designing a nuclear bomb? Heck, USING a nuclear bomb? "Mistakes"? How on earth can you can these things, "mistakes"? I call them willfull acts of sensless, sadistic evil. Exactly as evil as crashing planes into civilians. In the case of the nuclear bomb, its even worse.<P>You say that you have lots of realtives who fought and died to defend foreigners' freedom? If that is the case, I must salute them. <P>Did you know, that all across the EU, at 12:00 CET, there was a three minute silence for the people who died in the US over the recent events. The last count I saw, which was this afternoon, was that 4792 people were missing. <BR>Has there ever been even a second of silence for the hundreds of thousands of people who died because of US "mistakes"? No. Has there been a whole three minutes of silence for people who died because of *someone's* (no one is sure who did it, there is no proof to show that it was bin Laden, at least not yet) "mistakes"? Yes.<P>American lives are not worth more than Libyan lives, or Indian lives, or African lives. But you are treated as if they are, simply because you are the only world power.<P>That is my m ain grievance. I grieve for the countless hundreds of thousands who have died, un-regocnised, because of US "mistakes".<P>I challenge you, all of you, to call that stance "eastern european propaganda" or "arabic lies" or whatever. It is the truth.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000020&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>When  i started reading this furom, i was oing to reply to many stupid idiotic things that most people where saying. However as it wore on i realsed that <BR>a) they/you wouldnt listen (because)<BR>b) We are all pretty shcked by recent events anyway<BR>c) World War 3 could possibly be in the hands off the sae guy who said that "i believe most off our imports come from foreign countries". <BR>Anyway, id like to say that what many people are suggesting, ie war, could not be further from the correct way to respond to this... idiocy, these suicide attacks.<P>this is because that while about 4000 complete inoccents died  for no sane reason, this is nothing to the number of innocents that will die because off a war. <BR>Yes, innocents, no i dont mean the terrosists. All terrorists should die slowly and painfully through chinese water torture combined with long blunt hoocks. Bush said that they would make no distiction between the attackers and the people harbouring the attackers. Well, shit, call me dumb, but how exactly are the normal people in a country harbouring? sure, the government COULD useing twisted waarped insane Bush type logic be guilty, but the number off civilianse that die would by far outnumber the ones from the world trade center. <P>How would this be any different from their attacks? Dont say that you would not be killing for a stupid reason, because revenge is as dumb as it gets.<P>Perhaps some people will call me insensitive, and i must admit im not good at sensitivity. i prefer numbers and cool logic. Numbers and logic tell me that 4000 people who are already dead (tradjicly) are soon going to be used as an excuse to kill many times that many to get to about 100 people tops. Ths 100 being the maximum number in an organisation that prevented any word off an attack against America to leak out.<P>I am off course a VERY silly person, but i think that Finding the terrosists before you nuke the place and wipe out any evidence of the adjacent groups that work in other countries can be colected would be dumb. <P>This last thing might confuse people, but i mean that attacking any one country because of a terroist attack is the act of an ignorant. If a terrosist org is only in one country its stupid and cant work basic tactics, much less hijak 3 planes att ones and crash em into well chosen targets.<P>Ok, i dont think i've explained my point to well, or said all i want to say, but the post is WAY longer than i was gonna make it, and none off you really want to read it anyway. <P>Yours, FBofD<P>------------------<BR>The world is not my oyster, it is the shellfish/crustacea of my choice.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000021&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I must say that this is pretty funny to me.<P>I expected somewhat of an observant response, instead I hear from you two the bitching and ranting that the USA will slaughter countless civilians of Afghanistan. I'd like to challenge you both to show to me evidence where the USA has played butcher to innocent people and claimed mistake. <P>Also the reason we dropped nuclear weapons on Japan was only in RESPONSE to their suicide bombings of home territory base. As I have said before, look at how OTHER countries would handle these attacks, then question what we do.<P>I don't see much of people in the Sweden community who share our ethnic differences, when they reach that magnitude then you can say they are as free as us.<P>I love how people from other countries fabricate stories of "countless" lives that have been taken by the US and its broadsword. I suppose that number would be countless because not one of you can summon me numbers for proof.<P>BTW: When president Bush called for war he meant all nations in all aspects. This isn't going to end with Afghanistan, it will carry on probably forever with policies and raised awareness. These wars will be fought by intelligence, not by tanks and marines. I also highly doubt it will be fought with bombers, especially in a dense civilian cluster such as the terrorist use. They will revoke the assasination policy and then we will see where these dogs hide.<P>[This message has been edited by AnGrY-EQ-FrEaK (edited 09-17-2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by AnGrY-EQ-FrEaK (edited 09-17-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000022&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>The only thing I have to say is in regards to the many references here and other places about the US nuking Japan. The US bombings were a necessary evil! Yes the Japanese had mulled over a surrender. Unfortunately they were also preparing their POPULACE (that's right kiddies! They were planning to use thier ENTIRE POPULACE as kamikazis(?) in case of US invasion of the main islands) to fight the US. Imagine if you will... Armed US troops (and Aussies and Brits as well) going up against the elderly,women,youths, and CHILDREN all mostly armed with archaic weapons (pitchforks, clubs, steak knives, etcc..) along with their remaining armed forces. Not a pretty scenario I must say. The estimated costs to the military alone (all sides) was estimated at over a hundred thousand (not counting the civilians). Why they chose those 2 targets, I will not go into. But the calculated risk of using the atomics was as follows : a few thousand civilians or a few hundred thousand+ ? I agree that killing of innocent civilians is deplorable. I get sick when I read about innocents dieing ( I get especially sickened when I read about the Palestinean children getting gunned down by the Israelis. Why aren't the children with their parents? Why aren't their brave parents the ones throwing the stones?). So the next time any of you learned fellows decides to use the bombing of Japan as  an example of the evil side of the US, get your facts straight. This is not propagana, like you enjoy spreading from the safety of your hem or anstalt, but history. Look it up yourselves.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000023&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Well that awnser is simple Sohn.<P>Freedom is depicted by being allowed to have an open perspective to any and all aspects of life. <P>In this country we may not have illogical freedoms, which I agree with you we should have, but we have essential freedoms. The freedom to have variety of ethnic flavor, to marry into whatever we wish, to have freinds from all walks of life. See, in places that look free doesn't mean they really are. You might live in a country that lets you drink alcohol at 12, drive cars at 10.

</FONT><HR>No matter what kind of attack people say Japan was planning I think US made a terrible mistake by dropping those bombs.<BR>For the record Hiroshima alone killed 140.000 people before the end of 1945 and in the years after upwards 200.000 people died as a direct result of the bomb. This figure does not include all the issues which Japan still deals with today.<P>Nightwalker<BR>Violence begets violence.<BR>Agression comes back to you.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000028&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>//"Wouldn't surrendering to terrorism be advocation of violence?"<BR>//<BR>No, it wouldn't. It would show the world that you are above that kind of thing. Try leading by example.<P>There has never been anything farther from the truth.<P>If you do not punish terrorists, why should they stop? Bomb after bomb, death after death.. it would never end.<P><BR>At least SOME terrorists may be concerned with their lives and not do some things (obviously not the suicidal ones) if they thought they would be caught and punished.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003962.cgi&ReplyNum=000030&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Phi,+Mad0man,+Sohn........ya+this+for+you+guys">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">
