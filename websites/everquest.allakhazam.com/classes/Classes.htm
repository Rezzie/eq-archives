<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice of what class
to play is really one of personal preference.&nbsp; They all have advantages
and disadvantages.&nbsp; One major factor in your choice of class is whether
you plan on grouping or playing alone.&nbsp; There are some classes that
just aren't suitable to play solo.&nbsp; Read the descriptions carefully
before picking a solo class.&nbsp; Of course, every class is fun to play
in a group, and grouping is really encouraged in the game design.&nbsp;
Therefore,&nbsp; I would suggest you choose your class based upon how you
would like to play in a group.&nbsp; This needs to fit your personality
and how you like to play within the game.&nbsp; I see the classes in three
categories (with some crossover of categories):
<p>1.&nbsp;<b> <font color="#990000">Fighter Types</font></b> - or tanks
as they are referred to in the game - including Warriors, Paladins, Rangers,
Shadow Knights,&nbsp; Monks, Berserkers, and maybe Rogues.&nbsp; Clerics,
Shamen, Druids and Bards can fill this role in a pinch, as can the pets
of Necromancers and Magicians, but not very efficiently.&nbsp; These classes
see the most action.&nbsp; They are always at the forefront of every battle,
and they rarely find themselves out of the action.&nbsp; If you like wading
into every battle, shouting bonzai, and hacking off heads and limbs, this
is for you.&nbsp; Because every party can use multiple fighters, you will
never be at a loss for a group.&nbsp; However, these classes are tougher
to solo and lack the means to travel and to extricate themselves from tough
battles that the magic classes have.&nbsp; The first time you have to run
back to town to buy stuff, you will really envy that magic user's gate
spell.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of the ability to bind can also be frustrating
to a tank.&nbsp; It is also very expensive to buy equipment for most of
these classes, and heaven help you if you die somewhere where you can't
retrieve your corpse, forcing you to repurchase all of your armor all over
again.
<p>2.&nbsp; <font color="#990000"><b>Magic Support</b> </font>- including
Clerics, Enchanters, Shamen, Bards, and Druids, and to some extent Magicians
and Necromancers (though they really fit the third category better).&nbsp;
These classes, while possessing some offensive skills (especially the Shaman,
Bard and Druid), are far more valuable in how they enhance the skills of
other party members.&nbsp; Most of them are very difficult to solo (except
the magician, druid and necromancer).&nbsp; Their primary role is to buff
the fighters with enhancements and defenses and debuff the monsters to
make them easier to hit and kill, then stand back and let the fighters
do the dirty work.&nbsp; Their role in a battle is then support by healing,
charming, etc.&nbsp; They are also very useful for traveling, healing,
sneaking around and other non combat related stuff.&nbsp; You may enjoy
these classes better if you are the type who likes to role play more than
just kill and level.&nbsp; The healers are also supposed to keep track
of the hit points of each party member and keep them from dying.&nbsp;
If you chose one of these classes, you should be happy with the fact that
while you may not be the hero that demolished the monster, you were the
one who made it possible for that hero to do his job.&nbsp; Every party
needs one or two of these classes, especially the healers.
<p>3.&nbsp; <b><font color="#990000">Magic Attack</font></b> - including
Wizards, Necromancers and Magicians, and to some extent Druids.&nbsp; These
classes have the ability through firepower and summoning to quickly kill
monsters when the fighters start to get low, and most importantly, kill
off the monsters who break off and run for help before they can summon
their big brothers to whoop your butt.&nbsp; This is especially true of
the wizard, who has no crossover and really only fits into this category,
yet does it best of them all.&nbsp; Except for the wizard, These are the
best solo classes in the game.&nbsp; If you play one of these classes,
you have to be prepared to sit back and patiently bide your time while
the fighters bash at the monsters, conserving your mana to strike where
it is most effective and, for necros and magicians, directing your pet
to the most useful area.&nbsp; You should also be prepared to spend a lot
of the game staring at the inside of your spellbook, meditating to get
back spent mana.
