  <tr><td>(8-10-99)</td><td>For those of you who haven't seen the Fear
equipment, I got a couple screenshots in the last day or two, they're the
runex.jpg files in the <a href="fear">fear</a> dir.  They're a bit dark,
but you should get the idea.  Sorry about the lack of updated, my
interested in Eq waned quite a bit over the last week, too much fun in RL,
especially with the new level 46 min for Fear, I'm not looking forward to
squeezing through 2 hell levels to get back in there :(</td></tr>
  <tr><td>(8-05-99)</td><td><b>Updated: Equipment List (2H Blunt)</b><BR>
                            Well, got the last stat off that Troll/Ogre only staff from fear, and also got some info on a Barbarian Only 2H Hammer
                            that drops off Cazic himself, it's got 13 Wis or so and has the Winter's 
                            Road effect.  I'll try to keep you all informed :) Still no pic of the
                            shaman stuff, please, if you're wearing some, send a decent pic :) </td></tr>
  <tr><td>(8-04-99)</td><td><b>Updated: Equipment List (Misc)</b><BR>
                            Added the last of the Fear armor, and fixed a few other things.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>(8-01-99)</td><td>One last little thing before I leave.  The new staff from Fear (or at least the only new one found so far) is Ogre/Troll
                            only, no Barbarians.  It's a 20:42 with 15 Wis and the effect of Malisment.  Might have other bonus stats, not sure
                            of em though.  But there ya go, something for you Trolls and Ogres to look forward to since you get shut out of the
                            Observers Staff (though you do get that VERY nice earring as well).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>(7-31-99)</td><td>Well folks, I'm taking off for a week, won't be back until around Monday the 9th.  Don't let that stop you from sending
                            me screenshots of the Shaman equipment stats and texture look, it's suppsed to be grey or silver from what I hear, but
                            I'd like to actually see some.  I will probably still find some time to make various updates and such, since I'll still
                            be checking email and whatnot, just not testing or new spell info, stuff like that, for a week.  In the meantime, like
                            I said, I'd love to get screenshots of the shaman armor, and screenshots of the stats and actual exterior cam pic of 
                            both the new shaman weapon in Fear and the Mortificator's Staff.  Thanks, and have a good week, watch out for those
                            Glare Lords :)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>(7-31-99)</td><td>No update really, just wanted to say.. Fear Plane rocks.  It's a great zone.  It's laggy, yes.  The mobs skip a bit, true..
                            but it's well laid out, the mobs are well designed and keep you on your toes, and it's hard.  Not impossible, but certainly
                            hard.  If you just want equipment, you really only need 12, except for harder equipment, like the SK stuff, might be hard
                            to get.  No worries, though, frogs aren't too hard :)  We didn't get any shaman equipment, but we did get a TON of paladin
                            stuff, and no Paladins in sight, heh.  Got Druid stuff, looks nice, AC is quite a bit lower than ours, but stats are similar.
                            Got quite a bit of SK stuff, nice and black :)  Got some Ranger, can't really say much about this, was just bracers, so
                            hard to tell, but it's forest green, could be good, got Monk too, didn't see it, and one caster piece.  No Bard, no Cleric, 
                            no Shaman, no Rogue, no Warrior.  We killed some big stuff though, like Fright, the dracholich, and then we all got OWNED by 
                            a glare lord that took us by surprise while we were setting up for Dread.  He killed everyone in my group but the warrior with 
                            one spell.  Really makes you evalute your tactics.  All in all, it's a GREAT place, and I HIGHLY reccommend you visit.  I did 
                            pretty well, and I'm only level 39, was the lowest one there, and I could still DD for typically 200 on 60% of the mobs.  Most 
                            of em run from 43-47, harder ones go 45-50, and a select few clear 50 by a good margin :)  I took several pictures, I'm gonna 
                            throw em up with no editing besides cropping, cause I'm sleepy.  If you wanna peek (and I know you do) just click:

                            By the way, there were 30 of us, I died twice, and it was pretty much my fault when you think about it, and we got the biggest
                            know to date piece of armor, the Lustrous Russet Breastplate.  We can use it, but we'd be better off with the Rune Etched, but
                            just for the kick, the stats are AC 35, +15 Str, Sta, Dex.  Beat that :)<BR>
                            Oh, and there's another Shaman only weapon in there somewhere, I'm guessing it's a Drach or Fright/Dread/Terror drop.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>(7-30-99)</td><td><b>Updated: Equipment List (Chest. Bracer, Feet), </b><BR>
                            Added our chest and bracer from Fear, and added the Lustrous Russet Boots, the Lustrous Russet equipment is not
                            shaman only, it's actually pretty much everyone but druids, monks, and int-casters, and it just so happens the Boots have +wis, the rest of
                            the stuff I've seen doesn't, so I won't post that stuff.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>(7-29-99)</td><td>If anyone wants to send me the info on the shaman eq from fear, it'd be appreciated.  I know at least one of the mobs
                            that drops it, but I hear some other pieces come off a bit bigger one, curious to hear if that's true or not.  Also,
                            I know we have an AC 26, +12 Wis +25 Mana Chest, just don't know if it has other stats, and we have a bracer.  We should
                            have a full set in there somewhere probably, please send it in, I can't hunt all the info down myself :P</td></tr>
  <tr><td>(7-29-99)</td><td><b>Updated: Equipment List (Feet, Waist)</b><BR>
                            Added the Shaman-Only Boots from Fear to the list, no mana or wis bonus.  Also added the Belt off Drachy, it's a nice
                            one :)
                            On a sadder note, it's really starting to get to me how VI can't get things right the first time, and their complete
                            lack of communication about changes.  Last night they took Fear down again for 20 min, and when it reopened, people
                            jumped back in.  Half of the first half of people to zone in were dead before the second half of people finished zoning.
                            Now, I'll all for having a hard zone, and this is the way I feel the Plane of Fear should be.  However, it should have
                            been like that from day one.  There are level 9 paladins running around with AC 30 breastplates that a level 50 can
                            now only expect to get in a group of 30+ players.<br>
                            I mean, a group killed everything in Fear except Cazic Thule himself, and he had one foot in the grave before the fight
                            was stopped and the zone taken down for "tuning."  Come on, the zone had been up for a <b>day</b> and they realize, "Hey,
                            a group of 6 can get 50% of the equipment here!"  Gee.  So they bring it down, and back up, and get hordes of people slaughtered
                            without any warning until after most of them had multiple corpses in the zone.<br>
                            Sorry, I'm rambling.  Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of powerful equipment that is very difficult to get.  I'd rather
                            see it quested for, even like the crafted armor quests, rather than mob-dropped, but if that's how VI wants to do it, they
                            need to set the zone up right the first damn time.  It's better now than it was before, IMO, but there shouldn't have been
                            a before.  That's my rant for the week, I hope, heh.</td></tr>
