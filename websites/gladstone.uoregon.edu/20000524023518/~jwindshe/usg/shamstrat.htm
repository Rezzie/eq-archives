In the future, this will have information on places to level, ways to level, armor and weapons, group tactics, etc.  For now, just a bit on good places to level.

<table width="90%" border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=2>
  <tr><td><b>Leveling Spots</td><td>Early levels (1-4) are best spent in Everfrost.  Once you hit 4 or 5, you can either choose to stay in Everforst and head to the plains,
                                    or you can sprint throught Blackburrow, and head out to the Western Karanas.  Once you get to around 8 or 9, you'll want to hit Blackburrow to make fast
                                    money for spells and get some experience off of the bigger gnolls.  You can also do this in Splitpaw if you want, the run is more dangerous, but the
                                    zone is much less crowded.  In the 10 - 14 range, the various Karanas are all good, as well as Misty Thicket.  Then, you should probably head to Highpass
                                    or the Oasis.  Upper teens should check out Unrest as well.  Into the 20s, you can still get decent experience in Unrest and Highhold, but you might also
                                    want to check out Cazic-Thule or Upper Guk.  Najena and Mistmoore as well.  There are lots of places in this range, just find one you're comfortable with that isn't too
                                    crowded.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>Specialization</td><td>Our most expensive spells are con, yes. BUT, 4 are pets, which are going to be cast even less than buffs, so IMO a moot point. The other expensive ones
                                    are the high level poison and disease. Well, how many of these are you going to toss in a combat? 1 disease, 1 or 2 poisons. So if you reduce the cost to
                                    cast those, how much does that really save? <BR><BR>

                                    Know what else you're gonna be casting? Debuffs. The Malise line and the Drowsy line are both Alteration, as well a the healing line and the regen line.
                                    Me, I don't buff a huge amount before combat, mostly because it's really expensive and so spec would allow me to buff more, but our late buffs, which is
                                    what we are really looking at, last damn near forever. <BR><BR>

                                     Con Lines Cast in combat- <BR>
                                     Disease - 1 a fight (300) <BR>
                                     Poison - 1 or 2 a fight (320-640) <BR><BR>

                                     Alt Lines Cast in combat- <BR>
                                     Drowsy - 1 to 2 a fight (175 - 350) <BR>
                                     Malise - 1 a fight (175) <BR>
                                     Healing - Tons (150 per) <BR>
                                     Listless - maybe one (90 per) <BR>
                                     Incapacitate - probably (150 per) <BR>
                                     Regen - perhaps (200 per) <BR><BR>

                                    Out of combat, it's our bucketloads of stat, hp, ac, and attack speed buffs vs pets. <BR><BR>

                                    So, I say Alt all the way. <br>
