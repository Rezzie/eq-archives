          <li>12-24-99 - Wow, the info is coming in quite steadily, giving me 
            little time to update everything!! Anyway, here's a few faction tips 
            sent in to me...<br>
            <br>
            - Erudites should not get teleports where there are treants or other 
            druids, as they are KOS, unless you have done something to improve 
            your faction with them.<br>
            - Don't kill Trumpy Irontoe in Qeynos twice - without honey mead he 
            gets cranky.<br>
            - Even if Barstomper at Fish's Ale is nice to you, he will help kill 
            you if you engage Trumpy or his buddies.<br>
            - Killing Blixkin Entopop's fire beetle pet Amber in Misty Thickit 
            will destroy your faction with the mercnahts of Rivervale.<br>
            - Never help anyone kill something if you don't want the faction hit. 
            Even if it's healing or buffing them, if the MOB goes down, you get 
            the hit.<br>
            <br>
            Also, here is a tip for easily ensuring that the faction info you 
            are collecting is correct: While playing, if you want to record what 
            factions are affected by a certain MOB, turn your log on before you 
            fight it, and then turn it off again after it is dead. This will output 
            all text scrolling through your textbar to a file called <b>eqlog.txt</b> 
            in your EverQuest directory. You can then open it in Wordpad or Notepad 
            and do a search for the phrase <b>Your faction standing with </b>and 
            it will proceed to run through all the faction changes that you have 
            logged. To toggle your log on and off, just use the command <b>/log</b> 
            in-game. I usually just turn mine on when I first connect to EQ and 
            it will automatically turn off when I disconnect.<br>
            <br>
            Also, I have received word that there have been numerous ogres to 
            make it successfully into Rivervale. Agmyles of the Karana server 
            has accomplished this feat long ago. Screenshots can be found at: 
            <a href="http://www.alliedgiants.com/EQ/shots/ogre.htm">http://www.alliedgiants.com/EQ/shots/ogre.htm</a>. 
            Not to make this a contest or anything, but it has come to my attention 
            that Mungalung of E'Ci can now walk the streets (or bridges) of Kelethin 
            safely, as long as he stays away from the banker who seems to not 
            belong to the MerchantsofKelethin faction group, and has sent him 
            diving from the platforms and charging for the nearest zone. He can 
            also walk the streets of Felwithe, paying close attention to shy away 
            from the cleric, paladin and caster guilds</li>

          <li>12-23-99 - Well, I've been quite busy pooling and sorting through 
            the faction info that's been rolling in since I've set up camp at 
            Caster's Realm. I've been collecting some faction info from quests, 
            and might start working on setting up a faction area for those as 
            well. Also, it was suggested that I create a table that tells what 
            race/class/deity combinations are KOS to which factions from birth. 
            This seems like a hearty task, one that I've not the time for at the 
            moment. If anyone is interested in this and would like to help out, 
            drop me a line.<br>

          <li>12-1-99 - Many thanks to Baelish over at Caster's Realm for hosting 
            me over at his place! Hopefully it will increase the traffic through 
            here and get more people submitting the faction info that everyone 
            has been looking for! On a side note, I hear that on the E'Ci server 
            an ogre named Mungalung has broke the barriers and has improved faction 
            enough in Rivervale to be able to walk in and out of the fine town. 
            He wouldn't tell me his secret in how he did it, only that it wasn't 
            through killing. Sounds like a quester to me!!</li>

              this up so that people can easily check here for what's been updated 
              recently. An oversight on my part. Site should be more useful now. 
              Soon I will be moving the site to Caster's Realm, but have yet to 
              finalize things with their webmaster. This site will probably stay 
              up as a link, but I am unsure yet. <br>
              Nektulos Forest area, Misty Thicket area, Kithicor Forest area up 
              with minimal faction information. Updated Faction List and added 
              detailed descriptions with plus/minus effects for some.<br>
              Updated all Area pages to look nice.<br>
              Several small updates to Area pages as well.<br>
