<h4>Jason's Page</h4>

This web page, much like any other, is meant to show the world what 
I have to offer.  A link will come up soon showing all of the papers 
I've turned in last year for my classes.  I mean to use my 10 megabytes 
to help people gain knowledge.  Isn't that what the Internet is all 
about, anyways?<p>

Comments?  <a href="mailto:jshah@enteract.com">Mail</a> me!<p>

Recently, for the (Illinois) State Gaussians meet, I borrowed a TI-92 
from my teachers for a month.  I made one game, one that I'm quite 
proud of.  It's called Conquer and is meant to be played over 
two calculators.  Read the ZIP File.  You can <a href="conquer.zip">
download</a> it here.<p>

I got rid of the animated GIF files.  Now, they have been incorporated 
into my AP US History project!  This project is a web page, the first 
project that my teacher has received like this!  Please see our 
Final Exam Project, <a href="history/index.html">"Hinsdale and the 
Automobile"</a>. Our grade was a 95% on the final project.  Drop 
us a comment if you know anything about Hinsdale!  Thanks!<p>

Here is my little <a href="ftp://www.enteract.com/users/jshah">FTP 
site</a>.  Right now, all I have on here are ZIPped archives of all of 
my papers that I wrote last year (my Junior year in High School).  If 
you find anything you like, <strong>PLEASE DO NOT COPY IT!</strong> 
Please cite your sources.  Otherwise I will have to kill you.<p>
