	<OL>
		If you're a web developer (and who isn't these days), EnterAct 
		offers the following program:<BR><BR>
		
			<STRONG>Discount Accounts<BR><Br></STRONG>
		<OL>
		 <P>We'll sell you <A HREF="tcomplete.html">CompleteAct Accounts</A>
		  	and all the additional services for your
			clients at wholesale prices - 25% off.  In exchange for managing
			these accounts (being the first line of contact,
			handling billing, etc.), you can resell these accounts
			to your clients at whatever cost (and profit!) makes sense
			to you.<BR>
			
			<P>Pre-pay discounts <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">still</FONT> apply!  Some
			developers pre-pay for their clients on an annual basis (a 30% discount),
			then bill their clients monthly, giving them an even greater profit margin.<BR>
			
			<P>The one-stop-shop concept is obviously a great marketing tool for you.
			Your customers have the convenience of a single monthly bill.  For you,
			it's easier to sell a monthly retainer fee in addition to hosting fees.<BR>
			
			<P>The reality is, you own your clients.  If you have clients at another
			ISP right now, you know that your ISP is getting their money, and has the
			on-going business relationship with them (i.e., the opportunity to sell
			them additional services). EnterAct reverses that relationship.<BR>
			
			And when you grow to the point that you've got your own T1 and servers,
			we can help you make the transition.  We can still work with you to 
			provide dedicated lines and/or dial-up services to you or your clients.

			<P><STRONG>Co-located Servers</STRONG><BR><BR>
		
			<OL>
				
			For $250 per month you can co-locate a server on our network to host your
			customers' CompleteAct accounts on.  This gives you the ability to have
			unlimited disk space; the operating system of your choice; control over
			processor performance and load (make those CGI scripts hum!).<BR>
			
			<P>In addition, after you bring in 15 CompleteAct accounts, we'll waive
			your co-location fees!<BR><BR>
			
			</OL>
			
			<P><STRONG>Referrals</STRONG><BR><BR>
			<OL>
			Because EnterAct doesn't compete with you for web development business, we can send
			all those calls we get your way!<BR>
