<ol>
<li>Download WS_FTP from <A HREF="http://www.tucows.com"
target="_top">http://www.tucows.com</A>
or <A HREF="http://www.ipswitch.com/downloads/ws_ftp_LE.html"
target="_top">http://www.ipswitch.com/downloads/ws_ftp_LE.html</a>.
<li>Copy the file you just downloaded to a unique folder or directory.  Call it wsftp if you like.
<li>If the file you downloaded is zipped (filename is followed by the
extenstion <font color=#bb0000>.zip</font>), <a href="zip.html">unzip</a> 
it. If it is an executable file (filename is followed by the extension
<font color=#bb0000>.exe</font>), simply run the program.
<li>The install program will ask a few questions about where you want to install the program and where you want your files to download.  
<li>When the install program is finished, double click the <font color=#bb0000>WS_FTP</font> icon.  You will see the following screen:<p>
<center><IMG WIDTH=386 HEIGHT=308 SRC="wsftp1.gif"></IMG></center><p>
<li>To connect to your account at EnterAct (let's say you want to upload your web pages to your public_html directory) click the <font color=#bb0000>New</font> button and for the <font color=#bb0000>Profile Name</font>, put 
<font color=#bb0000>EnterAct</font>.
<li>The <font color=#bb0000>Host Name</font> should be <font color=#bb0000>shell.enteract.com</font>.
<li>Leave <font color=#bb0000>Host Type</font> as <font color=#bb0000>Automatic detect</font>.
<li>Enter your username and password where prompted (remember, all usernames are lower case).  NOTE:  If you were going to connect to a different ftp site, you would want to click the <font color=#bb0000>anonymous login</font> checkbox and enter your 
email address (<font color=#bb0000>username@enteract.com</font>) in the password field.
<li>You may leave the rest of the fields blank.
<li>Click <font color=#bb0000>OK</font>.  You will see the following screen:<p>
<center><IMG WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=376 SRC="wsftp2.gif"></IMG></center><p>
<li>The left side of the screen will show the directory structure on your hard drive.  To go up a level (if you're not already at the root level), simply double click the green arrow at the top.
<li>The right side of the screen shows the directory structure of the host you connected to (in this case, your account at EnterAct).
<li>To download files from the host to your hard drive, simply double click the file on the right side that you want.  Alternately, you could highlight it and click the arrow pointing to the left.  Either way, the file will be transferred to your hard 
drive in the directory you have selected on the left.
<li>To upload files from your hard drive to the host (if you want to move your web pages to the server for instance), simply double click the files you want to transfer or highlight the files and click the arrow pointing to the right.  Either way, your 
files will be transferred to the host in the directory you have selected on the right.
<ul>
<li>NOTE: Towards the bottom of the screen there will be three file transfer type options: <font color=#bb0000>ASCII</font>, <font color=#bb0000>Binary</font>, and <font color=#bb0000>Automatic</font>. When uploading or downloading a 
file that is text-only (HTML files for example), select the <font color=#bb0000>ASCII</font> option. When transferring images (GIF's, JPEG's, etc.) or any other file formats, select the <font color=#bb0000>Binary</font> option.
</ul>
<li>You can always connect to any site (not just EnterAct's) to download files.  All you need to know is their ftp site.
<li>That's it! To close the program, just click the close button at the lower left hand corner of the screen
