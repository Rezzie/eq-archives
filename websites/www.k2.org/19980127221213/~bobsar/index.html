<h1>BOB'S MARATHON GUIDE</h1>
Below are some comments on the various marathons I've run.  I've included the year run so you can get an idea of how up-to-date the information is likely to be.  Send queries/comments to bobsar@enteract.com.

<p><u>Arkansas</u><br>
<b>Booneville (1996)</b><br>
Marathon I'm least likely to run again.  Smallest marathon I've run (~40 runners).  Flat out-and-back course with no scenery and no spectators.  Nothing but water and a little bit of fruit at the finish line.  No finishers medals.  Nearest chain hotels quite a ways away.

<p><u>Arizona</u><br>
<b>Tuscon (1996)</b><br>
1000 runners.  Point-to-point course.  Either scenic or boring course, depending on your opinion of desert landscapes.  Hilly loop around a small town at the start, followed by spectatorless straight shot down a desert highway the last 20 miles.  Net 1000+ foot elevation drop, a definite PR course.  Excellent post-race spread with tacos and the like.

<p><u>California</u><br>
<b>Napa Valley (1994)</b><br>
One of my favorite marathons overall.  1000 runners.  Point-to-point course.  Rolling hills first half, extremely flat second half.  Very scenic rural course, starting in hills at edge of valley, and finishing in valley past vineyards.  Mustard in bloom in vineyards.  Best pre-race pasta dinner I've had.<br>

<p><u>Delaware</u><br>
<b>Delaware (1995)</b><br>
Tiny race - locals and those trying to run all 50 states.  Out-and-back course.  Flat, rural, no trees - exposed to the elements.  December timeframe leaves you at mercy of weather.  Snowing with windchill near zero degrees when I ran it.<br>

<p><u>Florida</u><br>
<b>Disney World (1994)</b><br>
Large race.  Loop course.  Not nearly as festive as you'd expect.  Extremely flat.  You run a mile or so through each of the three theme parks (closed to the public when you run through), and the rest is on service roads closed to spectators (except at two points).  Pre-dawn start with fireworks to beat the heat.  When I ran the inaugural, there was a six mile out-and-back past the sewage treatment plant which I believe has since been eliminated.  Skimpy post-race food.  Crowds at start and pasta feed were poorly managed, not what you'd expect from Disney.

<p><u>Georgia</u><br>
<b>Atlanta (1995)</b><br>
1000 runners.  Essentially out-and-back course, very hilly in the first and last third, flat in the middle.  Course map suggests Cardiac Hill near the 23 mile point is the last uphill - don't believe it, there are more.  One of the toughest courses I've run.  Run though a variety of neighboorhoods, reasonable crowd support.  Convenient to get to start/finish area via public transit.

<p><u>Hawaii</u><br>
<b>Honolulu (1994)</b><br>
25000+ runners.  Over half of them Japanese, a large number of whom walk the entire length, leading to a course that is open for over 10 hours and the ridiculous sight of "runners" taking cigarette breaks.  Pre-dawn start with fireworks.  More or less an out-and-course which starts in Honolulu, heads over Diamond Head, then east, turns around, and finishes in a park at the base of Diamond Head.  Flat other than the two climbs of Diamond Head.  A decent number of spectators.  Expect hot and humid conditions by race finish.  Shell necklaces for top 5% in age group, which is easier than you think when half of the runners are walkers.  Cool T-shirts.<br>
<b>Maui (1997)</b><br>
One of my favorites.  1000 runners.  Point-to-point course starting near the airport, and following the highway to Kaanapaali Beach.  Few spectators other than in Lahaina.  Flat other than some significant hills for a few miles before the mid-point.  Pre-dawn start.  Very scenic, with most of the last half along the ocean.  As this is held the time of year that the whales are around, you can actually whale-watch while running.  Plenty of masseuses at the finish.

<p><u>Iowa</u><br>
<b>Marathon to Marathon (1997)</b><br>
200 runners, with a decent number of marathon relay runners in addition.  Point-to-point course from Storm Lake to Marathon.  Rural and boring - be prepared to learn what manure smells like.  Some rolling hills, but nothing major.

<p><u>Illinois</u><br>
<b>Chicago (1990-4, but this is my hometown race so the info is up-to-date)</b><br>
5000-10000 runners.  Loop course through a variety of city neighborhoods.  Extremely flat - a PR course.  Decent number of spectators throughout, including a dragon in Chinatown and a marching band on the South Side.  Spectator numbers have increased significantly recently with increased visibility due to a big $$ sponsor.  Scenic finish along Lake Michigan.  Organizational snafus like running out of medals and mylar blankets in the past, but extremely well run the last few years.  Public transportation makes it convenient for spouses etc. to see runners at multiple points on the course.<br>
<b>Lake County (1991)</b><br>
500 runners.  Point-to-point course, with PR possibilities if the wind is out of the north.  Shared start with a 10k and a half-marathon, so plenty of runners to throw off your pace the first half of the race, followed by a lonely second half.

<p><u>Massachusetts</u><br>
<b>Boston (1993, 1996)</b><br>
10000 runners.  Point-to-point course.  Primarily downhill course, with PR capabilities if the wind is out of the west.  Heartbreak Hill is overated; the downhills take a much bigger toll on your legs.  Spotty spectators in the first half, as you pass through small towns with big groups of spectators once a mile.  Tons of spectators in the later miles, including 4 or 5 deep in Boston proper.

<p><u>Michigan</u><br>
<b>Bayshore/Traverse City (1995)</b><br>
200 runners.  Rural out-and-back, somewhat scenic wooded course.  Flat.  Few spectators.  Very low budget - $10 entry fee, finishers medal without ribbon, fruit and water at finish.

<p><u>Minnesota</u><br>
<b>Grandma's (1992-95)</b><br>
One of my favorites.  Point-to-point course.  Very scenic, with first 18 miles along the wooded shore of Lake Superior on an old state highway.  Small rolling hills, but mostly flat.  PR course if the weather is cool, which given the June date is not always the case.  Duluth's big event of the year - a very festive atmosphere and supportive locals.  Book your hotel months early, as they fill fast.<br>
<b>Twin Cities (1991, 1992, 1994)</b><br>
My favorite.  Point-to-point course from the Metrodome in Minneapolis to the State Capitol in St. Paul.  Metrodome start gives shelter from the weather and plentiful bathrooms.  Run through tree-lined upscale residential neighborhoods right when the leaves are changing color.  Run around 5 small lakes.  Excellent spectator support - they pretty much line the length of the course.  Long gradual uphill in the late miles, but I set my PR here.  Fills up several months ahead of time, so enter early.  I have nothing bad to say about this race.

<p><u>Missouri</u><br>
<b>St. Louis (1993)</b><br>
1000 runners.  Loop course through mostly commercial areas.  Moderately hilly.  Reasonable number of spectators.  Starting line is just outside of host hotel lobby.<br>
<b>Kansas City (1997)</b><br>
500 runners.  Loop course through both Missouri and Kansas.  Fairly hilly.  Plenty of relay runners to throw off your pace.  The most course marshalls I've ever seen.  Few spectators (at least that was the case in a cold rain in 1997).

<p><u>Montana</u><br>
<b>Ghost Town/Helena (1996)</b><br>
200 runners.  Rural point-to-point.  Start in a ghost town on top of a mountain, then run downhill down a dirt road for the first 5 miles.  Significant rolling hills in the middle miles.  Few spectators until near the end, when you share a course with 5k/half marathon.

<p><u>New York</u><br>
<b>Adirondack/Schroon Lake (1997)</b><br>
600 runners.  Rural loop.  Very scenic - heavily wooded, lightly travelled 2 lane road for the first half.  Very hilly first half, mostly flat second half.  Few spectators.  Great food at the finish.

<p><u>Nebraska</u><br>
<b>Lincoln (1997)</b><br>
1000 runners.  Loop.  Not as flat as you might expect for Nebraska, but not bad.  Mostly residential streets.  A fast field overall due to this being the National Guard championship

<p><u>Nevada</u><br>
<b>Las Vegas (1996)</b><br>
1000 runners.  Point-to-point.  Slight gradual downgrade with nary a hill.  Extremely boring course.  You are bussed 26 miles into the desert and run back towards the strip.  Nary a spectator until mile 25.  

<p><u>North Dakota</u><br>
<b>Bismark (1996)</b><br>
<100 runners.  Rural out-and-back.  Extremely flat course on lightly travelled roads through farm country - a PR course.  Have to pay close attention to markings on roads, as few course marshalls, few runners, and some turns makes it easy to end up off course.

<p><u>Ohio</u><br>
<b>Columbus (1994)</b><br>
Several thousand runners.  Loop.  Flat - a PR course.  Mostly residential streets, with some commercial and the OSU campus thrown in.  3 separate loops passing through downtown so you get a significant number of spectators.  Iffy weather - perfect the year I ran it, nasty the last two years.

<p><u>Oregon</u><br>
<b>Portland (1995)</b><br>
Several thousand runners.  Loop.  Run through a mix of industrial and residential areas.  Ugly course - surprising for Portland, but that seems to be the only way to avoid being extremely hilly.  Mostly flat with some rolling hills and a nasty hill climbing a bridge around mile 15.  Decent number of spectators.

<p><u>Pennsylvania</u><br>
<b>Pittsburgh (1994)</b><br>
1000 runners.  Loop.  Somewhat hilly course through mostly commercial and industrial areas.  Cross 3 long windy bridges over the major rivers.  Finish in downtown park.

<p><u>Rhode Island</u><br>
<b>Ocean State/Warwick (1995)</b><br>
1000 runners.  Point-to-point course that runs most of the length of the state.  Scenic course through small towns along the coast.  Decent number of spectators.  Passed out skittles at one of the later aid stations.  Rollings hills the entire lenght of the course.

<p><u>South Carolina</u><br>
<b>Carolina/Columbia (1997)</b><br>
500 runners.  Very hilly loop course through a mix of residential and commercial areas, with several miles on a military base.  Not many spectators.

<p><u>South Dakota</u><br>
<b>Mount Rushmore/Rapid City (1996)</b><br>
1000 runners.  Scenic, wooded point-to-point course.  Significant net downhill, with a couple of challenging uphills thrown in - a PR course.   Few spectators.

<p><u>Virginia</u><br>
<b>Shamrock/Virginia Beach (1995)</b><br>
500 runners.  Out-and-back.  Flattest course I've ever run.  First and last 4 miles on the boardwalk - expect obscene winds.  A PR course other if not for the wind.  Some scenic wooded miles after the boardwalk, but boring military base stretch in the middle before turning around.

<p><u>Wisconsin</u><br>
<b>Lake Geneva (1993)</b><br>
100 runners.  Loop course through farmland with some residential in the second half.  Share the course with a large 25k race, then suddenly find yourself all along at 25.1k.  Hilly.  Lots of rollers in the first half, and a couple of nasty hills in the second half.  May date means warm temperatures likely.  Few spectators.<br>
<b>Milwaukee (1993)</b><br>
1000 runners.  Point-to-point course.  Mostly rural, with residential and lakefront in the later miles.  Mostly flat, with a significant downhill in the last few miles - a definite PR course, especially if you get a tailwind out of the north the whole time.  Water cups with lids and straws at aid stations a nice touch.  Not many spectators.

<p><u>Wyoming</u><br>
<b>Moose Chase/Jackson Hole (1997)</b><br>
<100 runners.  Rural point-to-point.  Very scenic.  Lightly travelled dirt road for most of course.  The only race in which I had to stop to let a herd of cattle cross the course.  Moderately hilly, at 6000 feet of altitude.   Few spectators.  No finishers medals.
