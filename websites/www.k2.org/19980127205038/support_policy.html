<h1>Support Policy</h1>

<P>We at EnterAct realize that connecting and staying connected to the Internet
can be a daunting task. It is our goal to provide you with a level of 
service and help that
will set our company apart as one of the best. There is no charge for support.<p>

<hr>

<p>There are many ways to get support at EnterAct:
<ol>
   <p><li><strong>"The EnterFAQ"</strong>
<br>Go <a href="http://www.enteract.com/faq">here</a> to
find solutions to common connection problems and instructions on setting up various internet applications.
   <p><li><strong>Email</strong>
<br>If you are able to send email, you may send a message to <a 
href="mailto:support@enteract.com">support@enteract.com</a>. Describe 
your problem as best as you can. This is our preferred method for support. 
This account is always monitored and many times we check our mail at 
night after hours. Many simple issues get nearly instant responses.

<p><li><strong>Newsgroups</strong>
<br>You may also find help and answers in the newsgroups <a 
href="news:enteract.help">enteract.help</a> 
and <a href="news:enteract.discussion">enteract.discussion</a>. Post your 
question here if you are experiencing a problem you feel may be a common 
one others will benefit from or know answers to. Both we and 
more knowledgeable EnterAct users read these newsgroups.

<p><li><strong>Telephone: (773) 248-8511</strong>
<br>9-10PM Monday-Friday
<br>9-5PM  Saturday
<br>12-5PM Sunday
<br>If you reach our voice mailbox, (it is our goal for this not to 
happen) leave a detailed message. We will get back 
to you as soon as possible. You can also fax us at (773) 325-9664.

<p><li><strong>Pager: Phone: 800-SKY-8888 (PIN 1987354), or <a href = "/pager.html">Web interface</a> *Emergencies 
only*</strong>
<br>If you notice that the modem pools, DNS, authentication or other
servers are down, feel free to page us anytime at the above number.
Please keep in mind that the above number is for emergency use only
and that normal support issues should be dealt with via one of the
other three options listed above.  Thanks.
