<H2>Work and Family</H2>

<P>I have retired from being a software developer at
<A HREF="http://www.lucent.com">Lucent Technologies</A> in Naperville,
IL.  I am married to Susan and have two daughters,
<A HREF="http://absolut.sites.uiuc.edu/heather">Heather</A>
, who works for the
<A HREF="http://www.uiuc.edu">University of Illinois</A>
, and Claire, who has just returned from spending her senior
year in Madrid, Spain.  Outside of work, my passion is dancing.
I also like to play

web page and am active member of

<P> My wife, Susan, and I do several kinds of dancing, square dancing,
round dancing, ballroom, and country & western.
When we are not dancing ourselves, we are teaching.
Our favorite form of dance is round dancing.
Round dancing uses ballroom steps,
but each dance is prechoreographed and the leader, called the cuer,
calls out the steps so that all of the couples are going around the
circle doing the same figures at the same time.
It is very pretty and a lot of fun.
I cue for a couple of dance clubs and have choreographed some of my
own dances.  The

and Sunday dance schedules.
