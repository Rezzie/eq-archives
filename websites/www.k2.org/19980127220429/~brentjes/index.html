<H1>The Brent Jessee Recording Homepage<IMG SRC="handmic.gif" WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=50 ALIGN=texttop></H1><H2>Digital Audio, Video, Hi-Fi, Vacuum 
Tubes and other geek stuff, with other cool Website links, too!</H2><P>I was born with a microphone in my hand, probably a Shure SH55, and I never put it down.  In fact, in the years since, I picked up many cool things to plug the mike into,  such as reel-to-reel and cassette decks, PA systems, mixing boards, digital recorders, and both an AM and FM transmitter.  THEN I discovered video.  Then came antique radios, vintage tube gear, and of course vacuum tubes.  Then, there's my jammin' daytime gig at United Audio Centers, a great place to work because I dig making customers happy, AND I get hands on all the latest A / V toys!  So, between making tapes, fixing radios and VCRs and Hi-Fi gear, who has time
to sit and read Web Pages?<P><HR><H2>But Listen Up, Chase Your Mouse Around, and Get a Free Screensaver or a Tube Database!!</H2><IMG SRC="openfor6.gif" WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=72 ALIGN=right>If you are looking for vacuum tubes, this is
