<H1>We Want Web Developers!</H1>

<h4>Here at EnterAct, we're very excited about The Developers' Program</h4>

<hr>

<h2>The Pitch</h2>

<P>We have a little dream.  We know EnterAct is a terrific ISP. All 
right, we're a little biased.  But our dream is to be such a 
<STRONG>great</STRONG> ISP that you'll line up to sign up.

<P>In talking to some of our current clients, we've found most of you 
would like some combination of the following:

<OL>
<p><LI>An ISP that's responsive, quality-oriented, reliable, and 
knowledgeable;  in short, an ISP you'd feel comfortable
recommending to <strong>your
</strong>clients.
<p><LI>A chance to be a <strong>one-stop-shop</strong> for your customers.
<p><LI>An ISP that refers business to you.
<p><LI>An ISP that does not compete with your company.
<p><LI>A way to make it worthwhile (i.e. profitable) to 
<strong>host</strong> your clients' sites.
</OL>

<h2>The Deal</h2>

<p>If you're a web developer (and who isn't these days), EnterAct offers 
the following benefits:

<ol>

<p><li><STRONG>Discount Accounts</STRONG>

<P>After the purchase of your personal CompleteAct, we'll sell you 
additional <A HREF="complete.html">CompleteAct Accounts</A>
and all the additional services for your
clients at wholesale prices - 25% off.  In exchange for managing
these accounts (being the first line of contact,
handling billing, etc.), you can resell these accounts
to your clients at whatever cost (and profit!) makes sense
to you.
<P>Pre-pay discounts <em>still</em> apply!  Some
developers pre-pay for their clients on an annual basis (a 30% discount),
then bill their clients monthly, giving them an even greater profit 
margin.
<P>The one-stop-shop concept is obviously a great marketing tool for you.
Your customers have the convenience of a single monthly bill. For you,
it's easier to sell a monthly retainer fee in addition to hosting
fees.
<P>The reality is, your clients are your clients.  If you have clients at 
another ISP right now, you know that your ISP is getting their money,
and has the on-going business relationship with them (i.e., the opportunity
to sell them additional services). EnterAct reverses that
relationship.
<p>If and when you eventually grow to the point that you've got your own T1
and servers, we can help you make the transition.  We can still work with
you to provide dedicated lines and/or dial-up services to you or your 
clients.

<P><li><strong>Co-located Servers</STRONG>
<p>For $495 per month you can co-locate a server on our network to host
your
customers' CompleteAct accounts on.  This gives you the ability to have
unlimited disk space, the operating system of your choice, and control over 
processor performance and load. (You can make those cgi applications hum!)
<P>In addition, once you've registered 15 CompleteAct accounts with us, 
we'll waive your co-location fees!

<P><li><STRONG>Referrals</STRONG>
<p>Because EnterAct doesn't compete with you for web
development business, we can send all those calls we get your way!

</ul>
