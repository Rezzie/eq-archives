<TR ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><TD COLSPAN="2" ALIGN="left"><BR><BR>The Great Plains Gypsies were concieved in 1995 by singer, songwriter, guitarist Dan Whitaker and drummer John Roche following the demise of their former band, A Horse Named Bill. The two wary musicians decieded they had enough desire and gumption to call themselves a band, even though they were a mere duet.  The focus of the band was to present their stockpile of original and other traditional and obscure songs with straight forward arrangements.  After recording their first single and full length CD, the two asked their friend and producer, Scott Schenke, to join the band.  Tim Anderson is the newest member of the group, playing bass. <BR><BR> 
     The Great Plains Gypsies are not content to play the same songs in the same way, day after day.  Instead, they prefer to mix things up by playing different instruments and ever changing set lists, as well as inviting guest musicians to record and perform with the band.<BR><BR>     The band is currently recording material for its next full length release.<BR><BR>This web site has been set up and is maintained by the band to inform those interested in the group on what the Great Plains Gypsies have done and what they will be doing in the future.<BR><HR><ADDRESS><!--Webber_Auto_StampDNR-->Page maintained by Jake Smedley, gypsies@enteract.com.
