<p>There is an old saying in business - price, quality or
service; pick any two.&nbsp; In today's troubled economy the
customer is often lured into thinking price is the most important
of the three.&nbsp; After 50 years in business, we at Northern
Moulding have learned these three qualities must be equally
represented in our business if we are going to gain and keep your
business. </p>

<p>Our pricing is extremely competitive.&nbsp; This is the
easiest of the three to prove.&nbsp; We would be happy to quote
your next order along with whomever you normally buy from.&nbsp;
You have nothing to lose and money to gain. </p>

<p>The quality of our product speaks for itself.&nbsp; Let us
show you some samples.&nbsp; It's the best way for you to see
exactly what we offer. </p>

<p>But an excellent product is nothing without superior
service.&nbsp; We challenge you to find a more flexible shipping
service than ours.&nbsp; We can ship your product using virtually
any mode - rail container, truck, or piggyback.&nbsp; We will
package to your exact specifications.&nbsp; You decide when and
where you need material and we will come up with the most cost
efficient way to get it there on time. Our reputation is built on
service, and on our well trained sales staff.&nbsp; We know the
fastest way to lose money is to lose a customer because they
didn't get what they wanted when they needed it. </p>

<p>If you're not getting the best price, quality and service from
the company you're currently doing business with, you're losing
money.&nbsp; We'd like to help you get some back. </p>
