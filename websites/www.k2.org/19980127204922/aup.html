EnterAct's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) outlines some limitations on
the use of your EnterAct account.  Our goal in establishing this AUP
is to protect both our users and the larger Internet community from
the consequences of irresponsible use of EnterAct accounts and
resources.  EnterAct's AUP chiefly prohibits acts that are illegal,
that violate generally accepted standards for online behavior, or that
misuse EnterAct resources to the detriment of other users.

<p>

Violations of the AUP can result in account termination.  We take
violations of our AUP seriously, and as a matter of course investigate
reports of AUP violations.  An account may be temporarily suspended during
this investigation period.

<p>

Broken down by category, actions we specifically prohibit with 
EnterAct accounts include:
