<B><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Should you fail to send many, many email messages 
to Eliyahu Ross, containing numerous compliments, good thoughts, innuendos, or other wonderful 
expressions,  please be advised that an infinite number of leather-winged evil-satanical demons
of the night will tear themselves from the endless caverns of the nether world,
shrieking blood and fury, and  hurling themselves into 
the darkness with a thirst for your blood on their slavering fangs, searching the very threads 
of time for your throbbing heartbeat. &#174

Eliyahu Ross et al and their agents accepts no responsibility, of course, for any loss, damage or 
expense for this, either. &#174<P>
