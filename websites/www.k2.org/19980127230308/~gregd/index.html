<h2><center>Who <b>ARE </b>these guys and what do they <b>WANT</b> from us, anyways?</center></h2>
<img src="14033.jpg" alt="14033.jpg - 4.60 K" width=200 height=134 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>The Band In Question have been noodling around these parts, these parts
being Chicagoland (that's what THEY call it, not us...) for the last year or so, questioning
the authenticity of what it is THEY call music.  Their discoveries will amaze and startle you 
nearly to the point of <b>excitement!</b>  Let's take a look and see was' up!
<p><br>
<center><h2><center>Since before even, yes, the advent of the whell... </center></h2><center>
The Band In Question waited to become.  Since then,
they have been playing out constantly and expanding the overall consciousness of their audiences
past, present, and future.  To critical acclaim, they have received the praises of bar owners and 
patrons alike across North America as being one of America's "Best Kept Secrets".  
Playing a diverse and eclectic mix of rock, blues, and jazz styles, fused with a 
pseudo-folk/avante-garde twist, The Band In Question has been freaking out 
crowds and keeping them wondering as to what could possibly be next.

<h2><center>Really now, who <b>IS</b> The Band In Question?</center></h2>
<p>The Band In Question is made up of roughly five members.  They are as follows:<p>
<center>
<table>

<p>The long-standing members of the band are Bill and Greg, who met during the fall
of 1995 while playing for the now defuct band, Indian Summer.  Since then, the two hooked  up with Lonn, who joined the team the following summer.  The new team, focused on free-associcative music, improvisation, rhythmic and sonic 
experimentation, tempered with their own unique blend of standard and contemporary blues and rock.  Their peculiar voice, lending itself toward a kind of jazz sound was 
underscored by the arrival of Paul Maylan, who took over the bass-guitar duties from
Greg later that winter.
<p>Since then, the Band In Question have found themselves surfing the vibes around
them and spreading the good vibes they catch to the music-folk in and around the Chicago area.  The band is constantly exploring new sounds, so some of the 
members fluctuate, but Matt seems to be a staple.  Matt, a one-time member of the
United Stated Marines, plays electric piano and trumpet regularly with the band, adding his own freaky flare and groovy textures.
