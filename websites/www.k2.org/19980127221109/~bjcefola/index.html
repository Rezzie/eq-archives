"I insisted on meeting in a public place (for obvious reasons). This is a
                           dangerous woman...I prepared for vicious battle. And then, there we were.
                           She was seated with a crowd of paid bodyguards around her...Years of work,
                           of sleepless nights and attempts on my life, all came down to this
                           moment...'Mrs. Clinton,' I said in a loud voice...' I will not make any deals
                           with the White House.' A gasp, her anger turned to fury, and I continued; 'I
                           will not rest until you and your husband are in jail...My associate and I then
                           turned and strode out of the meeting, leaving a bitter and vengeful Hillary
                           Clinton and her high-priced bodyguards...From my experience in these
                           matters, I knew that confronting a criminal is sometimes the only way to break
                           a case wide open."<p>

                           -From a letter describing an alleged meeting with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
                           Puzzled White House Spokesman Mark Fabiani said the meeting never
                           happened. "The allegations of a meeting are as bizarre as they are false,"
                           Fabiani said.

"Everyday [North] American manners often delay responding to a situation that could prevent
attack. It has been proven that some rapes are preceded by a social situation-dancing together,
buying a drink or by a spontaneous verbal interchange. In these circumstances, a woman may have
a premonition that the situation is potentially dangerous, but she becomes confused. [Before
experiencing rape or attempted rape, a majority of victims have a "strange feeling," or discomfort.]
Social training about what is proper and "ladylike" teaches her not to make a scene or attract
attention to herself. She may also feel that although the situation is annoying, she is being silly to
consider it dangerous..."
<p>from "In Defense of Ourselves"

<hr>
Men rape. This Is Fact One, and no discussion of sexual assault should distract us from this reality. Historically, men
have always denied and evaded Fact One. This is Fact Two, and no discussion of the causes of sexual assault should
deflect us from this responsibility.
<p>
Recognition of reality and acknowledgment of responsibility can come with great difficulty to most men. Evasions,
denials, and defensiveness, however, miss the point and simply will no longer suffice.

 cannot have that spirit which fearlessness of opposition brings. It is not for rights women should ask, all rights are here--rather
      it is for you to inculcate into her the desire to get these rights. Feminists, come out from under the cover of morbid

Communalism is a demon which possesses many quite often because of the sustenance provided by dogmatism.  It is rightly said that there is only one truth though sages call it by several names.  It is the practice of rituals which makes one religion look different from another.  If human beings allow noble thoughts to come to them from every side social harmony, peace and prosperity are possible.  This does not happen generally.  The result is violence, disharmony and disorder.  One is led to believe that man is not rational.  He is a prisoner of his desires, emotions, feelings and sentiments.  When this ignorance takes a deviant turn it generates crime and many other evils.<P>
<P>
   Violence is a monster which is fed by the evil of communalism.  Applied as a principle it is totally counter-productive and produces avoidable suffering.  Wisdom lies in renouncing it as far as possible.<P>
-R.L. WADHWA, writing on the communal violence which wracked south Asia during the partition of 1947.<P>
<HR> 
"Even the term violence against women is problematic. What's missing from the term violence
against women? Men. Right, the active agent. In other words, violence against women is a passive
construction. It doesn't just happen. It's men's violence against women, and we need to say that.
The reason we need to say that is because we have to have a conversation that hasn't taken place
yet, and that is a conversation about masculinity, about manhood. <P>
-Jason Katz, founder of Real Men

A fable tells of a bunch of frogs who wanted a king. They petitioned the Great Frog and he put a
log in their pond and called it their king. After awhile, the frogs got bored with their king and raged
at the Great Frog to give them a king that would do something. The Great Frog then sent them a
new king, a stork, which ate them all up.

The moral to that story is that the frogs didn't need a king. But rather than manage their own
affairs, they wanted a leader, and one with clout. The Great Frog simply wrote them off as being
of no use to the species.<P>
-Kurt Saxon, The Survivor Vol. 4
