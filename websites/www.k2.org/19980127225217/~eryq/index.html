Who am I, anyway?</h2>
</a>

<p>
Currently, I'm a <b>Principal Programmer/Analyst for 
Hughes STX Corporation</b>, a subsidiary of Hughes Aircraft.
Right now, I'm working on contracts at <b>NASA / Goddard Space
Flight Center</b>, in Greenbelt, MD.
<a href="http://selsvr.stx.com/~eryq">Here's</a> my HSTX homepage.

<p>
But how is it, you ask, can I have a Chicago address?  The
answer is that I <b>telecommute</b>.  Sitting on my desk
is a Pentium 90 running Linux (a free Unix for PCs), with a 28.8
PPP connection into EnterAct (my Internet access provider).  
I'm a test case for Hughes STX, and have been since Summer 1994.

My girlfriend

in Hyde Park... it's on the top floor of an old three-story walk-up,
with hardwood floors, arches, a fireplace (which we can't
use, but it looks pretty), and a private balcony over a courtyard.

<img src="gifs/redarrow.gif">
FAQ about my name</H2>
</a>

<p> 
Only because so many people ask...



<H3>What's your real name?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p> 
My <em>legal first name</em> is <b>Erik</b>.  That's what appears
on my birth certificate and driver's license.   

<p> 
My <em>preferred full name</em> is <b>Eryq</b>, with <em>no last name</em>.
Just "Eryq".  This is the name
I do all my artwork under.  If you want to make me happy, this is how
you should address me in email, letters, etc.
Spell it exactly like this:

<p><center>
<font size=+1>
Eryq
</font>
</center> 

<p>
And hey, with that spelling, I'm pretty sure there aren't many other 
"Eryq"s around to confuse me with (although I have found at least one 
"Eriq").  

<p><b>Please please please...</b> do <i>not</I> use "Eryq"  
in front of my legal last name.
"Eryq" is <em>not</em> an alternate spelling of my  first name;
it's another name entirely.
If you absolutely must refer to me by my legal name, then please
either use it without the "Eryq", or put it afterwards in parens,
like this:


<p>
<center>
<font size=+1>
Eryq (<I>legal name here</I>)<br>
</font>
</center>


</BLOCKQUOTE>




<H3>Where did "Eryq" come from?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In college, I was remarking to some friends that no one seemed
to be able to spell my name right: I got "Eric", "Erick", "Erich", "Arik",
and even "Paul" (that one <I>still</I> mystifies me).
So we decided that I should have a spelling that would be
so far off-beam that the misspellings would be understandable.
I started with "Eryk", and then decided that it was still too
conventional.

<P>Curiously, I now get <I>fewer</I> misspellings of my name,
since people seem to remember it better.  Go phygg. <TT>:-)</TT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>Are you planning on adding a last name?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Apparently, there has been a subtle movement among my friends
to provide me with one.  Here's the current full name:

<p>
<center>
<font size=+1>
Eryq Ouithaqueue<BR>
</font>
</center>

<P>
Say the whole thing out loud a couple of times.  You'll get it.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Does mail addressed to "Eryq" reach you?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Yes, snail mail <em>does</em> get to me just fine if you
address your letters to "Eryq".  Remember, the postal service just
cares about the <em>address,</em> not the addressee, so you can also
send me mail under the name "Occupant", or "Resident", or
"Final Notice Before Eviction"...
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3>Are you planning to change your name legally?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Probably not to "Eryq": it's virtually impossible to exist as
a U.S. citizen without a last name.  All of the forms you have to fill
out require that first and last name be supplied.  And just <em>try</em>
explaining to the DMV or a savings bank why you don't have one. 

<p>
I also wouldn't change the spelling of my first name, for sentimental
reasons.  My mom chose it, from a somewhat bizzare inspiration: ask
me about that sometime...
<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3>Any other spellings?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Well, now that you mention it, yes... I am most formally addressed
as <b>OEryque</b>.  I will also accept (without insult) any and all 
<em>new and interesting</em> variations of the phonetic equivalent of "Eryq", 
including <b>Aerick</b>, <b>Yrych</b>, etc.  The most interesting
one to date has been <b>Llrllq</b> (the Spanish "ll" has a "y" sound).
Gaelic or Welsh spellings are most welcomed.
<p>

Back in '96 I volunteered to do the Web site for 
	<A href="http://www.streetwise.org">StreetWise</A>,
Chicago's newspaper by and for the homeless community.
How's the site look?  Feedback appreciated!
<P>
StreetWise employs the homeless, formerly homeless, and economically
disadvantaged men and women of Chicago as vendors; at this site
you can learn all about the paper, and even read some of the stories
and vendor profiles.

Perhaps the coolest thing I'm working on in is
the <B>MIME-tools</B> package: a collection of Perl5 MIME:: modules

You can read the
