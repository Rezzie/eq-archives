<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+3>Rapidly rising property values
due to increasing numbers of people moving into city neighborhoods are
causing a shrinkage of prime industrial zoned land near downtown Chicago.
As residential property values skyrocket, developers convert previously
industrial use properties into residential use properties in order to whet
the insatiable demand of affluent homebuyers. Since the companies being
forced out have already located themselves within the city limits of Chicago
they probably wish to remain in Chicago. Otherwise they would have moved
to the suburbs a long time ago. Regrettably many companies are finding
a shortage of prime industrial space within the city. The preferable solution
would be a creation of new industrial land within the city limits by completing
the demolition of residential and commercial properties in non-performing
sections of the city. In this way government can allow upscale residential
growth while creating industrial corridors in areas experiencing residential
stagnation. In this way the rapid increase of property values in neighborhoods
like Near North will be allowed to continue while industry will have an
option to move into cheap land in previously desolate communities.</FONT></FONT></B></P>
