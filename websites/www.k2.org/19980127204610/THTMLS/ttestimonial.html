<hr>

<FONT SIZE=-1>I want to thank Michael, Tracy, Tom and Jim for the great work in relocating
Essential Presence and my clients to EnterAct virtual Web servers.

<p>Bearing the scars to too many lost skirmishes on the ISP/virtual host front,
I had serious concerns about being able to move five domains seamlessly from
one host to another, but you did it in the promised 24 hours.  Not only
that, but you resolved both the expected and the unexpected glitches on the
fly, and promptly and patiently answered all my questions along the way.

<p>I was particularly impressed by your willingness to spend all the time I
required to meet face-to-face before making the move.  My livelihood depends
of the capabilities and reliability of the hosting service I use, and while
my needs may not be unusual, they aren't standard either.  Being able to sit
down with you to learn how you could fulfill them went a long way toward
helping me make this change with confidence.

<p>The quality of your dialup service was an unexpected, and highly
appreciated, bonus.  After months of RNAs, dead connections, dropped
connections and less than optimal connect speeds, my EnterAct dialup is a
giddy pleasure.  Not only do I connect--and stay connected--first try, but
file transfers and Web connections are much faster than my other accounts.

<p>All told, this is the first time I've had a completely positive startup
experience with an ISP or virtual hosting service.  Try as I might, I have
no complaints, and I'm looking forward to a long-term, mutually beneficial
relationship between EnterAct and Essential Presence.

<FONT SIZE=-1>Well, it almost seemed impossible, but it works.  Thanks to Jim.
Thanks again</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>You guys are doing an outstanding job!  I am delighted to refer customers to
you -- which is something I haven't been able to say about an ISP in over a
year.</FONT>

<hr>

<FONT SIZE=-1>I just wanted to take a minute to say how pleased I am with the service 
and support I have received from EnterAct.  This is a first-class 
operation.  I've called several times with problems (none of which were 
EnterAct's fault) and the tech support was friendly, understanding, and 
most importantly, competent.  While I am sure everyone at EnterAct 
deserves a hearty round of applause, I would like to specifically 
mention Mike Cloran, Jim Dreher, and Tracy Snell. These gentlemen have 
helped me get this thing going, and their assistance is very much 
appreciated.  Keep up the good work, and AOL and CompuServe are gonna 
get a run for the money.<br><br>  P.S. I will be telling my friends to call you.

<FONT SIZE=-1>I just dialed in again to EnterAct to see if you got back to me already
(I can't believe you did. You guys are so much better than XXX*) and 
this time it's working fine. Weird. I guess we can just chalk it 
up to a wierd Win95 problem (I love blaming MS!).</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"Thank you for helping out with the temporary access. I spent a week on a

business trip in Chicago and I wanted to demonstrate to friends and relatives

some of the awesome activities one can enjoy on the net. I found your service

very impressive compared to some Los Angeles area providers I have tried

before. I had no busy signals, disconnects and the line speed was great

constantly unlike some of the providers where it fluctuates significantly

throughout the day. We had a lot of fun testing some of the recent internet

phone applications with excellent results. I will be discussing the purchase

of a computer for/with my parents in the near future and I don't see a reason

the shop further for any other provider."</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"I wanted to compliment you/your company on a great experience so far.

I've dialed up at what I suspect are peak times, evenings and Saturday

afternoons, and never had any difficulty getting a connection.  I seem to

be able to get everywhere I want to go quickly and easily.<br>

<br>

Thanks for your help and great service!"</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"P.S. I love EnterAct, but I've been too busy surfing to write and tell you.  Great service guys!</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"Keep up the great work.  Over the years, I've had a number of 

different Internet providers, and I've never felt as positive about a 

provider as I have about EnterAct.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"Enteract:  Simply the finest internet service provider in the known universe.  No, no -- too 

gushing.</FONT>



<FONT SIZE=-1>"Enteract -- the name says it all.  Nooo -- too snappy.</FONT>



<FONT SIZE=-1>"It's cheap, it works, and the boys in tech know everything.  Hmmm.  Now we're cookin'.  

Really.  They know the answers to all my questions, and I've got a million of 'em.  They 

hooked me up no problem, and they know where all the cool links are, and the response 

time -- Hey, if Enteract was a car, it'd be a Porsche.  I signed up for a year.  Well, I'm going 

to.  All right, all right, I'll send in the form.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"I was very pleased with the service and help which I was given by EnterAct. I 

had called and wished to gain access to their services.  Tracy at EnterAct asked me some questions about my computer. He then walked me thru the setup 

procedure and made sure that I had access to their services, before he helped 

anyone else.He even helped me do my first FTP over the net while he was on 

the telephone. I was amazed that companies like this still existed in todays 

times, I thought that they had all disapeared. He made me feel like I was 

the most important customer they ever had. I would and have recommended other 

users to call EnterAct because that's where the REAL PROFESSIONALS ARE!</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"Since June, 1995 I have tried three of the "best" ISPs in Chicago. I 

guess it took the fourth try to make it right! I can't believe how clean 

and fast your conections are! And I can't believe how well you folks 

respond to support type issues!</FONT>



<FONT SIZE=-1>"When I first asked for information (when searching again for a new ISP) 

you were the first one of the few to write back. Then set-up was so easy, 

no dickering about checks and payments, you just answered all my 

questions, took my credit card info and set up my account. <br>

...<br>

You folks are *great!*</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"Well, I called you only about 24 hours ago, and so far, I'm impressed.

As I mentioned on the phone, my previous experience with an Internet

Service Provider was less than spectacular.  After four weeks, several

voice mail messages left, paging attempts, and e-mails, I still hadn't

heard a word from them.  What a way to run a business.</FONT>



<FONT SIZE=-1>"You got me set up in minutes.  I got home, entered the parameters you

gave me into Win 95, and managed to log on successfully.  Amazing.  Just

thought I'd let you know I appreciate your way of doing business.  Keep

up the good work - I hope things work out for you and the business does

well.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"Jim, got your voicemail today and you're VERY welcome for converting 

to an annual account.  I recommend you guys to everyone I know.  

And I have a link to your home page on both my web pages.  You guys 

are great!  -Tree</FONT>



<FONT SIZE=-1>"Part Two:<br>

Hey guys.  I really like the Usage page.  Very helpful info.  I guess 

signing up for an annual account is already paying off in my case 

huh?  I'm SOOOOOOO glad I am not paying AOL rates anymore...  

$2.95 an hour.  Puhlease!  Keep the awesome stuff coming. I sure 

appeciate it.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"While browsing the chi.internet newsgroup I saw several postings

mentioning enteract.com in response to pleas for recommendations

for good Internet Service.  It is good to see such nice things

written about your service.  I can also now attest to the fact

that you will <BR><BR><FONT COLOR="#8c1010" SIZE=+1>go out of your way</FONT> to help.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"You guys rock. I'm telling friends and switching my parents over! :)<br>

 ...enough griping about other ISPs here, now that I seem to have 

entered the promised land!</FONT>



<FONT SIZE=-1>""I asked if they had my favorite newsreader, tin, and they said they 

would install it. A few hours later, I received an email saying it was 

installed, and I was running tin soon thereafter! These guys are great! I've 

never seen service of such awesome speed on any ISP! I'll definitely be 

telling my friends about this!"</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"Right now, Tracy, my mouth is hanging open with gaping amazement.  All I

can say is, "WOW!"<br>

Oh, yes ... and THANK YOU.</FONT>



<BR><BR><FONT COLOR="#8c1010" SIZE=+1>Michael Rubin</FONT><br>

(After a service request to install some new software (downloading it, porting it to a new operating system and installing it) was completed in a little under an hour!)

<hr>



<FONT SIZE=-1>"Worked fine.  Thank you for your prompt reply.  Your tech support amazes me!</FONT>



<FONT SIZE=-1>"And, the following month...</FONT>



<FONT SIZE=-1>"The bbs I was on was closing down and people were looking for ISP's.  I posted a public message listing your service.  Also sent your info packet to those who asked me for info.  Hopefully they will be as pleased with your service as I am. <br>

<br>

I've had very few problems but your prompt replies to my questions are what I like about your services.  There is nothing more frustrating than to be having a problem and not hear anything back for a couple days.  I can expect replies by the time I get up in the morning or after I get home from work.  Keep up the good work!!!  </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>"Well, this is just a little of what people have to say about us.  
And no, we haven't stacked the deck!  You should see the testimonial my mom wrote....
but the guys wouldn't let me put it up here because that would be unfair!  All of 
these testimonials are from new customers.<br>

<br>



We hope you give us a chance to publish your testimonial here...<i>try us out!</FONT>
