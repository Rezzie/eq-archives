<OL>

<P>EnterAct will provide you with a full time connection to the Internet. How
this works varies with each level of service.<BR>

<P><STRONG>Dedicated 28.8 Kbps</STRONG> - This service provides you with a dedicated full time 
modem connection at EnterAct. You may connect to this modem full 
time. It's your modem, and no-one else connects to it.  To provide more than one of your
clients access to the Internet with 
this setup you must use an Operating System that supports routing 
IP (Such as Linux, FreeBSD, or Windows NT Advanced Server).<BR>

<P><STRONG>ISDN connections</sTRONG> - There are 2 basic types of ISDN interfaces. The first
uses an ISDN terminal adapter much like a modem. This setup requires the
same routing capability as the modem solution above. The second uses an 
ISDN terminal adapter to attach to your local network and can be configured
 to route traffic from your local net to the Internet.<BR>

<P><STRONG>T1 and 56.6Kbps connections</STRONG> - The
telephone company will terminate your dedicated circuit at EnterAct's facility and at
your facility. From 
this termination point you plug the dedicated circuit into a CSU/DSU which converts the
telephone company's signal into one appropriate for a LAN connection. The
CSU/DSU connects to a router which then connects (depending on your 
firewall choices) to your local network.<BR>

<P>You will need a telephone circuit and the following:<BR><BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Interface - An interface to your telephone network connection. This
     will be a modem, ISDN terminal adapter, or CSU/DSU.<BR>
     
  <LI> Router - This will handle sending the appropriate data packets from
     your local network out over your Internet connection.<BR>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Why are there multiple options for a T1?</FONT></STRONG>
<OL>
<P>Our T1 Level 1 gives you the benefit of having a full T1 without having to
pay the full costs if you are not using all the bandwidth. Level 1 service
allows your connection to use up to the full 1.54mbps throughput
capabilities of a T1 during heavy network demand. As long as your average
usage of the T1 does not exceed 128kbps this plan may be ideal for you. If
your Level 1 service ever starts using on average more than 128kbps we will
notify you and give you the option of moving up to Level 2 service or 
making adjustments on your network to get the average back below 128kbps. 
EnterAct will always notify you and give you the choice. See glossary for 
kbps and mbps.<BR>
