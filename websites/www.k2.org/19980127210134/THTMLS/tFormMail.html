<h1><center>Forms without scripting!</center></h1>
<p>
Some of the possible uses of this script are:
<p>
<ol>
<strong><li></strong>You want to have a form that will be mailed to you, but aren't sure how to 
   write the scripting for it.
<strong><li></strong>Want to have one script to parse all of your html forms and mail them 
   to you.
</ol>
<p>
<p>

<p>
<h2>Setting Up the FormMail Script:</h2>



        <li>Form Configuration:


The action of your form needs to point towards this script (obviously), and 
the method must be POST or GET in capital letters.  Version 1.5 of FormMail 
offers many new ways to code your form to tailor the resulting HTML page 
and the way the script performs.  Below is a list of form fields you can 
use and how to implement them.
<p>
        <li><h2>Necessary Form Fields</h2>

<ul>
<p>
                There is only one form field that you must have in your form, for 
                FormMail to work correctly.  This is the recipient field.
<p>
<hr>
                <li><h3>Field: recipient</h3>
<p>
<strong>Description</strong>: This form field allows you to specify to whom you wish for your 
form results to be mailed.  Most likely you will want to configure this 
option as a hidden form field with a value equal to that of your e-mail 
address.
<p>
<strong>Syntax:</strong><br>
<code>
&ltinput type=hidden name="recipient" value="email@your.host.xxx"&gt
</code>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
</ul>
        <li><h2>Optional Form Fields:</h2>
<ul>
<hr>
<p>
<li><h3>Field: subject</h3>
<p>
<strong>Description</strong>: The subject field will allow you to specify the subject that 
you wish to appear in the e-mail that is sent to you after this form has 
been filled out.  If you do not have this option turned on, then the 
script will default to a message subject: WWW Form Submission
<p>
<strong>Syntax:</strong><br>

If you wish to choose what the subject is:<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=hidden name="subject" value="Your Subject"&gt
</code>
<p>
To allow the user to choose a subject:<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=text name="subject"&gt
</code>
<p>
<hr>

<li><h3>Field: email</h3>
<p>
<strong>Description</strong>: This form field will allow the user to specify their return 
e-mail address.  If you want to be able to return e-mail to your user, I 
strongly suggest that you include this form field and allow them to fill 
it in.  This will be put into the From: field of the message you receive.
<p>
<strong>Syntax:</strong>
<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=text name="email"&gt
</code>
<p>
<hr>

        <li><h3>Field: realname</h3>

<strong>Description</strong>:  The realname form field will allow the user to input their 
real name.  This field is useful for identification purposes and will 
also be put into the From: line of your message header.
<p>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: 
<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=text name="realname"&gt
</code>
<hr>

        <li><h3>Field: redirect</h3>

<strong>Description</strong>:  If you wish to redirect the user to a different URL, rather 
than having them see the default response to the fill-out form, you can 
use this hidden variable to send them to a pre-made HTML page.
<p>
<strong>Syntax</strong>:
<br>
To choose the URL they will end up at:<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=hidden name="redirect" value="http://your.address/to/file.html"&gt
</code>
<p>

To allow them to specify a URL they wish to travel to once the form is 
filled out:<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=text name="redirect"&gt
</code>
<hr>


        <li><h3>Field: required</h3>

<strong>Description</strong>: You can now require for certain fields in your form to be 
filled in before the user can successfully submit the form.  Simply place 
all field names that you want to be mandatory into this field.  If the 
required fields are not filled in, the user will be notified of what they 
need to fill in, and a link back to the form they just submitted will be 
provided.
<p>
<strong>Syntax:</strong>
<br>
If you want to require that they fill in the email and phone fields in 
your form, so that you can reach them once you have received the mail, 
use a syntax like:<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=hidden name="required" value="email,phone"&gt
</code>
<hr>


        <li><h3>Field: env_report</h3>

<strong>Description</strong>: Allows you to have Environment variables included in the 
e-mail message you receive after a user has filled out your form.  Useful 
if you wish to know what browser they were using, what domain they were 
coming from or any other attributes associated with environment 
variables.  The following is a short list of valid environment variables 
that might be useful:
<p>
<pre>
REMOTE_HOST     - Sends the hostname making a request.
REMOTE_ADDR     - Sends the IP address of the remote host making the request.
REMOTE_USER     - If server supports authentication and script is 
                  protected, this is the username they have authenticated as.
                  *This is not usually set.*
REMOTE_IDENT    - If HTTP server supports RFC 931 identification, then 
                  this variable will be set to the remote user name 
                  retrieved from the server. *This is not usually set.*
HTTP_USER_AGENT - The browser the client is using to send the request.  
                  General format: software/version library/version
</pre>

There are others, but these are a few of the most useful.
<p>
<strong>Syntax:</strong>

If you wanted to find the remote host and browser sending the request, 
you would put the following into your form:<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=hidden name="env_report" value="REMOTE_HOST,HTTP_USER_AGENT"&gt
</code>
<hr>

        <li><h3>Field: sort</h3>


<strong>Description</strong>: This field allows you to choose the order in which you wish 
for your variables to appear in the e-mail that FormMail generates.  You 
can choose to have the field sorted alphabetically or specify a set order 
in which you want the fields to appear in your mail message.  By leaving 
this field out, the order will simply default to the order in which the 
browsers sends the information to the script (which isn't always the 
exact same order they appeared in the form.)  When sorting by a set order 
of fields, you should include the phrase "order:" as the first part of 
your value for the sort field, and then follow that with the field names 
you want to be listed in the e-mail message, separated by commas.
<p>

<strong>Syntax:</strong>
<br>
To sort alphabetically:<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=hidden name="sort" value="alphabetic"&gt
</code>
<p>
To sort by a set field order:<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=hidden name="sort" value="order:name1,name2,etc..."&gt
</code>
<hr>

        <li><h3>Field: print_config</h3>

Version Added: 1.5
<p>
<strong>Description</strong>: print_config allows you to specify which of the config 
variables you would like to have printed in your e-mail message.  By 
deafult, no config fields are printed to your e-mail.  This is because 
the important form fields, like email, subject, etc... are included in 
the header of the message.  However some users have asked for this option 
so they can have these fields printed in the body of the message.  The 
config fields that you wish to have printed shoul dbe in the value 
attribute of your input tag separated by commas.
<p>
<strong>Syntax:</strong>
<br>
If you want to print the email and subject fields in the body of your 
message, you would place the following form tag:<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=hidden name="print_config" value="email,subject"&gt
</code>
<hr>

        <li><h3>Field: title</h3>

Version Added: 1.3
<p>
<strong>Description</strong>: This form field allows you to specify the title and header 
that will appear on the resulting page if you do not specify a redirect URL.
<p>
<strong>Syntax:</strong>
<br>
If you wanted a title of 'Feedback Form Results':<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=hidden name="title" value="Feedback Form Results"&gt
</code>
<hr>

        <li><h3>Field: return_link_url</h3>

Version Added: 1.3
<p>
<strong>Description</strong>:  This field allows you to specify a URL that will appear, as 
return_link_title, on the following report page.  This field will not 
be used if you have the redirect field set, but it is useful if you allow 
the user to receive the report on the following page, but want to offer 
them a way to get back to your main page.
<p>
<strong>Syntax:</strong>
<br>
<code>
&ltinput type=hidden name="return_link_url" 
                                     value="http://your.host.xxx/main.html"&gt
</code>
<hr>

        <li><h3>Field: return_link_title</h3>

Version Added: 1.3
<p>
<strong>Description</strong>: This is the title that will be used to link the user back to 
the page you specify with return_link_url.  The two fields will be shown 
on the resulting form page as:
<p>

<code>
&ltul><br>
&ltli><a href="return_link_url">&gtreturn_link_title</a><br>
&lt/ul><br>
</code>
<p>
<strong>Syntax:</strong>
