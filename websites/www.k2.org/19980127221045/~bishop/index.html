<H4>This page is a symbolic representation of 2 people with only 
<U>one</U> thing in common, our love for eachother. Even though we
may not have many other things in common, that one thing is more than 
enough. This web page is dedicated to all couples, married and
unmarried, who share the same philosophy.</H4> <hr> <TABLE ALIGN=RIGHT

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><B>Beware of fraudulent business activity from these 3 companies: Bailey's & Associates, Inc., National Resorts Corp., and First National Acceptance Corp.</B></FONT></CENTER>
<p>
<FONT  COLOR=#000080>If you're at a shopping mall and you register in a drawing for a 4-wheel drive vehicle, only to get some sales pitch for a dumb membership to travel and lodging club on the day of the drawing, especially when there's no proof of an actual vehicle existing....Warning!!
<p>
<FONT  COLOR=#000080>If the companies that let the contract and the collectors for that contract happen to be using the same Post Office box and address when the actual location for their operation happens to be just over the state line....Bingo!!!
<p>
<FONT  COLOR=#000080>When you or your spouse gets harassed at your work place because some dumb hick named 'Tom' calls threatening to have your loan defaulted by some ficticious entity called the "Legal Review Board" not to mention waving the banner of federal law to justify his activity...I'd say that's a good clue!!
<p>
<FONT  COLOR=#000080>If these things and other possible cases of fraud are happening to you, then here are a couple links to valuable consumer resources:
<p>
<A HREF="http://www.fraud.org">National Fraud Information Center</A>
<p>
<A HREF="http://www.bbb.org">Better Business Bureau for U.S. and Canada</A>
<p>
.....and if I'm wrong about these companies, I really don't care, because I'm feeling much better as I type this.

I love this car very much and I had need for it when I used to work further out West. Now, I'm working down town, so I don't drive it very much. According to my bank that I'm financing the car through, the closing price on my car note is 19,726.57 (until January 25th). That's the price I'm selling the car for, provided the buyer pays for the cost of title and plate transfer and all that other trivial stuff..
<p>
Pictures of the car will be posted on this page....that is...as soon as I have the car washed. What can I say? I've been busy.</FONT>

<FONT  COLOR=#000000>Our individual web pages have not been changed or updated in quite some time (try a year). Since we have our own unique tastes and interests, our pages will be changed to something that reflects more to our interests (ie. Caress, being an obsessive Mud-Freak and me, being a PC-Software-Networking-freak). Watch out for changes in the months to come during 1998.</FONT>
