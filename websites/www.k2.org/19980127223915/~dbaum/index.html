<h2> Free Software
</h2>
Here are a few freeware programs I've written for the Macintosh.  They require
system 7, and have been tested very little, so use at your own risk.  Share and enjoy.  
<ul>

<li>
<strong>CivCheat:</strong> This program modifies saved Cilivilzation games,
giving you additional gold, settlers, or advances.

<p></li>

<li>
<strong>SimTower Cheat:</strong> This program modifies saved SimTower games,
giving you additional money.
<A HREF="software/SimTowerCheat.sit.hqx">Download SimTower Cheat 1.0</A>
<p></li>

<li>
<strong>ColPatcher:</strong> This program patches Microprose's Colonization to run a little
faster on 680x0 Macintoshes.  Disclaimer:  I <strong>do not</strong> work for Microprose,
and this patch was done without their knowledge.

<li>
<strong>HyperTyper:</strong> Need to change file types and creators?  Then this is just
the program you need.  OK, so it violates every Macintosh Human Interface Guideline, but
it still is &quot;the coolest 4K Macintosh program ever written&quot;.

<li>
<strong>FatPigBits Gold:</strong> Yes, the &quot;Ultimate Visiual Interface Inspection
Tool&quot; is now available on the web.

<p></li>

</ul>


Coming Soon... Virtual Keypad: the perfect way to play those keypad intensive games
on your PowerBook.
