Hi! This is my page. Here you will find out my interests, see pix
 I like, and see links to all sorts of things (sorry I don't 
have any links up yet). From my brother's page to an ANIME page 
(I love Anime). My interests are: Anime (Japanese Animation), 
MU*ing, Playing Quake, Making crafts, and the normal (Eating, Sleeping, Etc.).
