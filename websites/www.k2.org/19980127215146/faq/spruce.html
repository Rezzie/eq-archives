<h3>Want to add your CompleteAct site to our listing?</h3>

<P>Our index system will allow you to customize your entry on the
"CompleteAct Accounts" page by specifying a description of your site,
as well as determining the way you'd like your name to appear in the
list, and the desired page to jump to in your site.  Additionally, you
can set up a small "icon" image that will be shown along with your
name and site information.  If you'd rather your site didn't show up
in our index of pages, simply don't follow these directions; by
default, you won't be listed, by default.  If you've added an entry
and wish to remove it, remove the ".info" file you had created.

<P>

Information about your site is stored in a file that you create in
your 'vhost_yourdomain.com/http-docs' directory.  The file should be named
".info" . Most of the time, files beginning with the "." character
don't show up in directory listings on Unix systems, so don't be
alarmed if you create the file and can't find it. It's probably there.
The file needs to be flagged readable... you can accomplish this by
typing at the Unix command prompt:

<P><FONT COLOR="#BB1010">chmod a+r .info</FONT>

<P>The info file is formatted much like an HTML document. Each feature
is configured by a "tag", which is specified between angle brackets
("<" and ">"). For example, the description of your web site should be
indicated with the <description> tag; the description should be
terminated with a </description> tag. Everything in between those two
tags is the description of your home page, and will appear in the home
page index.

<P>Note: please do not use HTML within the description; making mistakes in
the HTML can screw up the entire page.

<p>

Here's a sample entry:

<dl>
<dt><a href = "/"><IMG WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=72 ALT="[icon]"
SRC="SBEA2.gif" BORDER=0><br><font size = "+1"><strong>EnterAct
</strong></font></a>
<dd>EnterAct, an Innovative Internet Service Provider
<br>
<dd><em><a href = "mailto:webmaster@www.enteract.com">webmaster@www.enteract.com</a></em>
</dl>

The <tt>.info</tt> file which created this entry is:

<pre>
&lt;icon&gt;SBEA2.gif&lt;/icon&gt;
&lt;name&gt;EnterAct&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;description&gt;EnterAct, an Innovative Internet Service Provider&lt;/description&gt;
</pre>

There are 5 possible tags, none of which are necessary. A default entry 
will be generated if a <tt>.info</tt> file merely exists, and is completely
empty. These tags override certain default values.

<dl>
<dt> <FONT COLOR="#BB1010"><tt>&lt;icon&gt&lt;/icon&gt </tt></font>
<dd>	This tag selects an icon to display.  Refer to the icon 
	as a URL relative to your homepage (i.e., if you want to display
        <em>http://www.yourdomain.com/GIF/icon.gif</em>, enter
	<tt>GIF/icon.gif</tt> in this
	tag.  If this tag is not present, no icon is displayed.  In addition, your
	icon must be 100X100 pixels or less.  If it is larger, it will not display.
<p>
<dt> <FONT COLOR="#BB1010"><tt>&lt;name&gt&lt;/name&gt; </tt></font>
<dd>	This tag provides the title for your page. If this tag is not 
	present, the title is your sitename, e.g., <em>www.yourdomain.com</em>.
<p>
<dt> <FONT COLOR="#BB1010"><tt>&lt;welcome&gt&lt;/welcome&gt </tt></font>
<dd>	This tag is usually not necessary. It makes it possible to jump
	to a page other than the default home page. For example, if you would
	rather people jump to
	<em>http://www.yourdomain.com/startherefirst.html</em>,
	you would enter <tt>startherefirst.html</tt> in this field.  The default
	is for people to jump to <em>http://www.yourdomain.com</em>.
<p>
<dt> <FONT COLOR="#BB1010"><tt>&lt;description&gt&lt;/description&gt;</tt></font>
<dd>	This tag provides a description of your site.  If this tag is
	not present, no description is included.
<p>
<dt> <FONT COLOR="#BB1010"><tt>&lt;contact&gt&lt;/contact&gt;</tt></font>
<dd>	This tag provides an email address point of contact. The
	default value is <em>webmaster@www.yourdomain.com</em>.
