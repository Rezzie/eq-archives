<li>On the left side of the screen you will see the files on your hard
drive.  On the right side are the files on the server you connected to.
If you connected to shell.enteract.com and logged in as yourself, these
files and directories will be what is in your personal account.
<li>To download files from the host to your hard drive, simply double click the file on the right side that you want.  The file will be transferred to your hard drive in the directory you have selected on the left.
<li>To upload files from your hard drive to the host (if you want to move
your web pages to the server for instance), simply double click the files you want to transfer.  Your files will be transferred to the host in the directory you have selected on the right.
<li>You can always connect to any site (not just EnterAct's) to download files.  All you need to know is the ftp site.
