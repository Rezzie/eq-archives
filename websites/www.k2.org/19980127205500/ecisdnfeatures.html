<td><a name=64><b>64Kbps and 128Kbps access speeds</b></a><br>
Dedicated ISDN technology allows your LAN to take advantage of Internet access speeds which let you experience the true power of the Internet.  1B, or 64Kbps, gives you speeds more than twice as fast as standard analog connections and 2B, or 128Kbps, is n


early four times faster!</td>

<td><a name=nearly><b>Nearly seemless access speed switching</b></a><br>
One of the great advantages of using ISDN technology with EnterAct is the ease with which you may upgrade or downgrade your service.  Whether you wish to upgrade from 1B (64Kbps) to 2B (128Kbps) service or visa versa, a few changes in your router settings


 and one call to EnterAct is all you need to do.  There is no need to order a new circuit - it's that simple!</td>

<td><a name=flat><b>Flat-rate circuit charges saves you hundreds of dollars</b></a><br>
With the vast majority of Chicagoland Internet Service Providers (ISPs), you must pay by the minute for your dedicated ISDN circuit charge. As you might imagine, a 24 x 7 connection can lead to some very  large circuit charge bills.  However, due to a spe


cial agreement EnterAct has with Ameritech, we can offer you an inexpensive, flat-rate circuit charge each month.  On average, this saves our business customers several hundreds of dollars in circuit charges each month. And not only will our agreement sav


e you money, but all Ameritech billing is forwarded on to you through EnterAct, so you never have to worry about dealing with the phone company!</td>

<tr>
<td><a name=stac><b>STAC compression support</b></a><br>
EnterAct's network allows for STAC compression at no extra charge.  With the proper hardware, this means data transfers of compressed data - most commonly files - can reach transfer speeds of up to 2 ½ times that of the allocated bandwidth for your line (


64Kbps or 128Kbps).</td>

<tr>
<td><a name=home><b>Home office option</b></a><br>
This slightly less expensive option allows you to have a dedicated ISDN connection over a standard dial-up ISDN line.  EnterAct will "peg-up" our end of your dial-up line, effectively giving you a 24 x 7 dedicated connection.  An 8 IP subnet is standard w


ith larger subnets available at additional costs. This option is ideal for residential line customers wishing to have a dedicated ISDN connection.</td>

<tr>
<td><a name=optional><b>Optional set up service</b></a><br>
Connecting a LAN to the Internet presents some difficult technical issues - particularly the configuration and on-going maintenance of Internet connection hardware.  EnterAct's optional set up service relieves you of this responsibility by covering the co


nfiguration, on-site installation, and first 30 days of maintenance for the router and terminal adapter you will need for your ISDN connection. EnterAct will bill you separately for the hardware necessary for your connection only after you have approved i


ts' purchase price.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=service><b>Optional managed service </b></a><br>
This service, to be used in conjunction with your optional set up service, relieves you of the responsibility of the on-going management of your router and terminal adapter.  In addition to monitoring your line, we will also monitor the router and termina


l adapter 24 x 7 and perform any necessary  remote or on-site maintenance immediately.  While you are still responsible for administering your LAN and all related equipment, this option can eliminate the bulk of your Internet connection management needs.<
