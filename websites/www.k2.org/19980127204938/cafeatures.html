<th><font size=4>Basic Features</font></th>
</tr>

<tr> <td align=left valign=top><a name=web><b>Web site with your own domain name</b><br></a> Web
surfers will be able to easily find your web site at www.yourdomain.com. This professional looking
and intuitive address is made possible by EnterAct's virtual web hosting service.</td> </tr>

<tr> <td align=left valign=top><a name=email><b>Email address at your domain</b><br></a> Email
communication is the Internet's most widely used business tool.  Virtual hosting enables you to use
your domain with your email address in an easy-to-remember format (i.e. you@yourdomain.com).  This
reinforces your unique identity on the Internet every time your contacts send you email. </td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td align=left valign=top><a name=rated><b>Rated #1 ISP in Illinois</b><br></a>
CNET, a much respected cable channel and Internet site, in an ongoing customer satisfaction survey has ranked EnterAct #1 in Illinois and in the top ten nationwide since July '96.  Over six hundred ISPs are ranked in this survey of  overall customer satisfaction.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=left valign=top><a name=twenty><b>25 megabytes server space</b><br></a>
Your CompleteAct account includes a generous 25 Mb of storage for your web and FTP files.  This is more than twice as much storage as many other providers, allowing you to create a  comprehensive web site with room to grow.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=left valign=top><a name=gigabyte><b>1 gigabyte of bandwidth/month</b><br></a>
Instead of charging you by the megabyte for data transfer, as many other ISPs do,  EnterAct provides you with a whopping 1 gigabyte of bandwidth per month.  Virtually all of  EnterAct's CompleteAct sites find this to be enough to satisfy their bandwidth needs.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=left valign=top><a name=unlimited><b>Unlimited virtual email addresses</b><br></a>
Virtual email addressing allows you to receive mail at any address you want for your domain.  This is a powerful feature for organizations of any size as it allows you to receive email at addresses such as sales@yourdomain.com and info@yourdomain.com at no additional cost.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=left valign=top><a name=webaccess><b>Web access statistics available daily, weekly, or monthly</b><br></a>
Your web sites' statistics will show you how often your website is being visited, what resources visitors are viewing, and where the visitors are coming from.  This information will give you a helpful analysis of your sites' strengths and weaknesses so you can continually refine your site to appeal to your specific target market.</td>
</tr>

<td align=left valign=top><a name=additional><b>Additional domain name mapping</b><br></a>
If you have more than one domain name registered, EnterAct can map the additional domain names to your primary web site.  The first such mapping is free of charge!</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td align=left valign=top><a name=addemail><b>Additional email addresses</b><br><a>
Though you may use as many virtual email addresses as you like at your domain, you may wish to have
more secure, password-protected e-mailboxes for your employees.  For a low cost, these additional e-mailboxes can be set-up and mapped to your domain or another e-mail address on demand.</td>
