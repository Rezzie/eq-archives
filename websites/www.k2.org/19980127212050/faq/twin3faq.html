<p><a name=tw3dll><h3>Winsock.dll</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>If you have several applications which use your modem (e.g. AOL or Trumpet Winsock), chances are very good that you will have more than one instance of <font color=#bb0000><code>winsock.dll</code></font> on your hard drive.  If this is the case, it cou


ld cause problems when you try to connect to EnterAct.  If it looks like you connect, but then cannot go to any web page, retrieve mail, or read news, it is possible that you have more than one of these files and they are conflicting. 
<p>To solve this, do a search for <font color=#bb0000><code>winsock.dll</code></font> from your file manager or from within DOS with the "<code>C:\>dir /s winsock.dll</code>" command.  You should have one in your Trumpet Winsock directory.  Any others sho


uld be renamed to <font color=#bb0000><code>winsock.old</code></font>.
</font>
<p><a name=paptw3><h3>PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>If you have Trumpet 3.0, you can use <font color=#bb0000>PAP</font> to log in automatically.  Go to the <font color=#bb0000>File/PPP Options</font> pull down menu and select <font color=#bb0000>PAP</font>.  Enter the username and password where prompte


d.  Note: If you log in manually, <font color=#bb0000>PAP</font> should <b>not</b> be selected.  Also, currently the TCG numbers (i.e., digital lines--any number ending in 0096) are not working properly when you choose PAP.  You will never receive an IP a


ddress.  Make sure you use the MFS (analog) numbers.
</font>
<p><a name=twprofile><h3>Trumpet's Profile</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Under the <font color=#bb0000>Dialer</font> pull-down menu, there is an option called <font color=#bb0000>Profile</font>.  In profile there is a button called <font color=#bb0000>server settings</font>.  Here is where you can enter a login script.  Bec


ause you can use <font color=#bb0000>PAP</font> there is no need for such a script.  Make sure every field is blanked out and that the check box at the bottom is not checked.  If these are not blank, you will not connect properly.
</font>
<p><a name=tw3login><h3>Login.cmd</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Unlike Trumpet 2.x, there is no need to modify the <font color=#bb0000><code>login.cmd</code></font>.  In fact, if you do modify it, you may not be able to get connected at all.  If you have modified it already, re-install Trumpet from scratch.
</font>
<p><a name=netmasktw3><h3>Netmask</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>As with Trumpet 2.x, the netmask must be set correctly (<font color=#bb0000>255.255.255.0</font>).  To change it from <font color=#bb0000>0.0.0.0</font>, you must select <font color=#bb0000>Packet Driver</font> instead of <font color=#bb0000>PPP</font>


 in your settings.  At that point you can change your netmask appropriately.  When done,  check <font color=#bb0000>PPP</font> again.
</font>
<p><a name=baudtw3><h3>Baud Rates, Init Strings, and Comm Overrun Errors</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Many times you will get com overruns with Trumpet Winsock.  There are a few things that can fix this.  1) Make sure <font color=#bb0000>MSS</font> is set to <font color=#bb0000>1024</font>.  2) Make sure that the baud rate is not set too high (no highe


r than <font color=#bb0000>57,600</font> for 28.8 modems and no higher than <font color=#bb0000>38,400</font> for 14.4). 3) Make the init string <font color=#bb0000>ATZ</font>.  I've noticed that some people who are using <font color=#bb0000>AT&F1</font> 


in Trumpet are getting comm overruns.  When they change it, the error messages go away.
</font>
<p><a name=ttrynumbtw3><h3>Try Different Phone Numbers</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>A good thing to try if things don't seem to be working right (you aren't authenticating, or you get an IP address but can't ping) is to try a different phone number on a different system.  This might in fact fix the problem.  Make sure that if you are 


using PAP you are not using the TCG (digital) numbers.
</font>
<p><a name=iaeftw3><h3>If All Else Fails...</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Exit trumpet, restart windows, and try again.  Can't hurt, can it?
