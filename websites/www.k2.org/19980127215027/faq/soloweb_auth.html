<H1>How do I set up passwords for my web pages?</H1>
<BR>

You may have the need to password-protect some parts of your web space
(for example, you might want to put your web stats on your web site,
but restrict their viewing to only yourself).  To set this up, after
logging in to enteract.com via a telnet application, follow the steps
below:<p>

<b><font size="+1">1. </font></b> 
Place all the files you want commonly
password-protected in their own directory, for example,
~/public_html/private/ (or ~/http-docs/private if you have a CompleteAct).

<font color="#000000"><pre>
   mkdir ~/public_html/private
   mv secret_file.html ~/public_html/private/secret_file.html
</pre></font>

<p>
<b><font size="+1">2. </font></b> 
Tell the web server that this directory is password protected.
You do this by creating a file named <tt>.htaccess</tt> in the directory
you just created.

<font color="#000000"><pre>
   cd ~/public_html/private
   pico .htaccess
</pre></font>

And then place the following in that file:

<font color="#000000"><pre>
   AuthUserFile /home/yourusernamehere/public_html/private/.htpasswd
   AuthGroupFile /dev/null
   AuthName ByPassword
   AuthType Basic

   &lt;Limit GET POST&gt;
   require user jdm tqbf
   &lt;/Limit&gt;
</pre>
<ol>
<li>Remember to replace <em>yourusernamehere</em> with your own username!

<p>
<li>In this example we're not using a "group" file, so we supply a group
file of /dev/null, which indicates that the file does not exist.
</ol>
</font>
<p>

<b><font size="+1">3. </font></b> 
Give the users you supplied in the <em>require user</em> line passwords.

<pre><font color="#000000">
   cd ~/public_html/private

   htpasswd -c .htpasswd jdm
   <em>Adding password for jdm.</em>
   <em>New password:</em>[enter password here]
   <em>Re-type new password:</em>[enter password again]

   htpasswd .htpasswd tqbf
   <em>Adding password for tqbf.</em>
   <em>New password:</em>[enter password here]
   <em>Re-type new password:</em>[enter password again]
</font></pre>

The example above gives an example of the use of the program htpasswd.
The htpasswd program constructs your password file for you, provided
you supply it with the name of the password file, the user and the
password.  The passwords are stored in encrypted form.

<br>htpasswd takes two arguments: (1) the name of the
password file (commonly .htpasswd), and (2) the name of the
user to be given a password.  An optional flag -c tells
htpasswd to create the password file.  You will need to use
that flag the first time you enter a user into a particular password
file.  (Note that we didn't use the -c flag for giving tqbf a
password, because the password file already existed).

<p>
The file .htpasswd will look something like this:
<font color = "#000000"><pre>
   jdm:$1$hH$sCtEGuWVmN2bD5N22t/hr1
   tqbf:$1$vq$FUsPx0Ofzt/AzXVtLMVrw.
</pre></font>

<p>
To delete a user, edit the .htpasswd file with pico and delete
the line corresponding to that user.

<p> To change a user's password run "<font
color="#000000"><tt>htpasswd .htpasswd <em>user</em></tt></font>" and you will
be prompted for the user's new password.

<p>
<b>That's all there is to it!</b>
<p>

There are more complicated examples of things you can do (for example,
assign users to groups and permit access by group membership).  For
these more complicated examples, consult the <a href =

Authentication Tutorial</a>.
