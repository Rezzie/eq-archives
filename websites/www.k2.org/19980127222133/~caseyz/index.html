<h2>Company Profile</h2>
<p>Uni-Label &amp; Tag, Inc. has been providing pressure-sensitive labels to a wide range of industries for more than 21 years. We 
serve a wide range of industries with an emphasis on the pharmaceutical and product identification industries. In the product 
identification area, current end uses range from smoke-alarms to sports helmets to golf-clubs. Almost any product that needs a 
retail or industrial identifying label is a candidate for Uni-Label&#146;s service.</p>
<p>Turnaround time is an important consideration today, and we&#146;ve stressed this concern throughout our operation. For example, 
our prepress system currently uses a state-of-the-art, around-the-clock Bulletin Board System and high-speed modem to 
move clients files easily and quickly. In the manufacturing area, our personnel have been trained to do everything possible to 
accommodate customer&#146;s special needs whether it be a unique label construction or a super-rush job. Complete GMP&#146;s and 
SOP&#146;s are on file for each of our departments.</p>
