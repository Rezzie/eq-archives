<P>Every site on the internet has an address.  This address is
actually designated by one of those numbers you've probably seen,
that look something like:  206.54.252.1.  These are routing numbers,
and tell everyone on the internet how to find a specific site.<BR>

<P>People aren't very good at remembering strings of numbers like
this, so the internet adopted a <I>Domain Naming System</I>.  Our domain is
named "enteract," and because we're a commercial site, "com" is appended 
to our name.  In addition, prefixing our domain with "www" or "ftp" tells
our server where to start looking within our domain.  And further
appending the name with a country, such as "uk," lets us know the site
is in the United Kingdom.  Note that the United States is the default, and
therefore ".us" is not added to sites in the US.<BR>

<P>Thus, www.enteract.com.uk would mean the World Wide Web Directory in 
Eneract's commercial domain in the United Kingdom. If you're interested
in having a domain name for your business, enter it in the form below, and
we'll instantly check to see if someone's using that domain or not.<BR>

<P><STRONG>For instance:  yourcompanynamehere.com  -- you don't need the www prefix.</STRONG>

<p>Enter the domain name you wish to check <br><BR>

<input type=text size=30 maxlength=50 name="name"> <BR>
<input type=submit value="Submit Form"><p>

EnterAct will register your domain with the InterNic. See our 
pricing page for costs. Currently the InterNic is taking 1-3 
days to register a name!
