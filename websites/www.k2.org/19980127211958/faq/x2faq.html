<hr width=55% align=center>

<p><h3>X2 Connect Speed</h3></font>
<p>X2 (and K56flex for that matter) is NOT twice the speed of a 28.8 modem
or a 33.6 modem. Line noise, compatibility, and legal restrictions keep
your connect speed down below the 56k mark, regardless of what your modem
manufacturer claims. It has been our experience that X2 modems are
extremely sensitive to line noise. Most consumers report more frequent
disconnections, and an insignificant increase in download speeds. This is
something we expect to clear up with later code and firmware upgrades from
the modem manufacturers. This is still a budding technology, and it will
be a while before all the kinks are ironed out.
<p>Windows95 may not be reporting the true connect speed that you've
achieved with your modem. It's come to our attention that older Windows
drivers don't have the ability to report the connection speeds above 33.6.
It is EXTREMELY important, in this case, that you install the modem from
the driver disks that come with your new X2 modem. Do not just let
Windows detect your modem. New drivers and .inf files may be available
directly from Microsoft's page. We'll add a link if we find them. 

<p><font color=#110860><h3>Getting the Current Firmware</h3></font>
<p>As X2 is a developing technology, it is a good idea to make sure that you have the
current firmware for your modem. Just becasue your modem is new does not necessarily mean
that it originally shipped with the latest version, as USR has been constantly tweaking
and upgrading it's X2 firmware. You can get the latest upgrade <a
href="http://totalservice.usr.com/upgrade" target="_top">here</a>.

<p><font color=#110860><h3>Testing Your Phone Line</h3></font>
<p>Since getting connections at X2 speeds can depend on the quality of your phone line,
it is a good idea to take advantage of USR's test BBS number to see if your line is
capable of supporting X2. To do this, use a terminal program (such as HyperTerminal in
Win95, or Zterm for the MacOS) and dial <font color=#bb0000>1-888-877-9248</font>. At the
login prompt, type <font color=#bb0000>LINE TEST</font>. You will then receive a message
as to whether your line is X2-capable or not.

<p><font color=#110860><h3>Init Strings</h3></font>
<p>On your modem manufacturer's web page, keep an eye out for modem
initialization strings. There may well be optimized init strings that will
help you get the best possible connection with your modem. You may also
consider contacting your modem manufacturer directly, if they offer
technical support, as they may have this information at their fingertips.
We will try to compile a solid list of init strings as they become
available.
<p>So far, we have seen that <font color=#bb0000>AT&F1s32=20</font> works well.
<p>In addition, a few customers have reported being disconnected 3 to 5 minutes into an
otherwise stable 50Kbps or higher connection.If you are experiencing this problem, try increasing
the value of the S10 register (found in the init string for your modem). It should be set to at
least 14 and maybe as high as 20. 

<p><font color=#110860><h3>Reporting Problems and Information</h3></font>
<p>Again, we ask that any users that try out the service, and let us know
how it appears to be working -- or not working. We are especially
interested in any trouble reports. For these purposes we've set up a
mailbox at: <a href="mailto:x2@enteract.com">x2@enteract.com</a>, and
any general questions about the technology or future plans can and should
still be directed to the usual <a 
href="mailto:support@enteract.com">support@enteract.com</a>.
