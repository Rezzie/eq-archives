<P>Click anywhere in the above image to see what happens with an imagemap.<P>

If you would like to set up an imagemap in your directory, follow
these steps:<P>

<H3>Prepare your Image</H3>

Select the image you'd like to inline.  Make sure it has big spaces
which are easy for people to click on.  Save it in a format which web
browsers can display as inlined images (GIF is the most universal, but
Netscape can also inline JPEGs, and they say over 70% of web browsers
are using Netscape...)<P>

<H3>Map your Hotspots</H3>

You must create a mapfile which describes geometric shapes on your
image and links them to Web documents.  There are many tools which
make this easy, like <A
HREF="http://www.city.net/cnx/software/webmap.html" target="_top">WebMap for
Macintosh</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.boutell.com/mapedit/" target="_top">MapEdit
for Microsoft Windows</A> and <A
HREF="http://icg.stwing.upenn.edu/~mengwong/mapmaker.html" target="_top">MapMaker
for X-Windows</A>.  
Be sure to save the image map file in NCSA format, and to transfer
the file to UNIX in text mode (to be sure each line ends with a 
newline character and not a carriage return).
Constructing the map-file manually is not too difficult, however.
You will just need to
obtain the coordinates for different points on your image.  The
image-viewer <b>xv</b> will provide
these coordinates for you: open the image with xv - 'xv myimage.gif' -
and click on the spot in the image for which you need the coordinates.
The first two numbers are the x- and y- coordinates at that point.

The mapfile, demomap.map,  used in this document is the following:

<font color = "#000000"><pre>
#Comments can appear in this file by prepending them with #
default demodefault.html # The default page to return 
rect demoblue.html 0,0 181,63 # Rectangular coord's of the blue box
rect demoorange.html 181,0 399,31 # ... of the orange box
rect demogreen.html 181,31 399,63 # ... of the green box
</font></pre>


<p>For full details on the imagemap configuration format, <A
HREF="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod_imap.html" target="_top">see the documentation at
Apache.</A><p>

<H3>Edit your HTML document</H3>
To inline an imagemap and properly configure it to translate clicks into URLs, you must add a line like the following to your HTML document: <P>

<font color="#000000"><CODE>&lt;A HREF="/~username/file.map"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="file.gif" ISMAP&gt;&lt;/A&gt;</CODE></font> <p>

Of course, you'll have to replace <CODE>/~username/file.map</CODE> with a relative URL to the map file you created in the last step, and you'll have to replace <CODE>file.gif</CODE> with the relative URL of the image you are inlining. <P>

Imagemaps are handled internally by the Apache httpd server when you
link to a "map" file.  Any file ending with <font
color="#000000"><tt>.map</tt></font> is considered by the web server
to be an imagemap map file and treated accordingly when "href'd" to.
We also have the imagemap CGI script installed here, but please don't
use it!  Apache's internal support for imagemaps is much faster.

<H3>Try it out!</H3>

This should get you started.  If you encounter problems, send mail
to <a href = "mailto:webmaster@enteract.com">webmaster@enteract.com</a>
including the URL to the page containing the imagemap and we'll try to
help you get things working!
