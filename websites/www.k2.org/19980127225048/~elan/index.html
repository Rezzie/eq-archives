Below is the logo.  Click on box to download illustrator 6.0 file without compression.
<P>
Note to the printer: Included is an illustrator 6.0 file.  I wasn't quite sure as to the extension used on pcs for Illustrator files.  I have tried to insure that separations will work correctly but please do check.  Colors used are custom colors an "NYU GREEN" and "NYU PURPLE".  I did not know the exact CMYK values so please alter the values in the paint styles/custom color dialogue box to their corresponding values.  Please call me if you have any problems (David has my contact information).  If all fails, given the CMYK values for "NYU GREEN" and "NYU PURPLE" I can save the file as an .eps and repost.
