<h2><big>One account, many purposes... </big></h2>

<p>If you're looking for my personal home page, drop me a line at <a
href="mailto:crawford@enteract.com">crawford@enteract.com</a> and I'll send you the URL.
Not like it's a big secret, but I'm keeping some of it unlinked for now.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I'm guessing you're looking for my <big>PalmPilot software</big>, Graffiti
Aid (aka <font face="Arial"><big>Grafaid</big></font>) which is available <a
href="grafaid.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want the Grafaid source and development info, it's available off of <a
href="about_grafaid.html">this page</a>.</p>

<p>If you're a <big>LiveWire</big> programmer, and use Netscape ES3.0, details of a
threading bug are <a href="ssjs3bug.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to try some Java stuff I've messed with, it and the source are over <a
href="java/BJApplet.html">here</a>. (It's a little Black Jack applet. Needs a lot of work,
but I had pretty much learned what I wanted to, and didn't feel like polishing it up.)</p>

<p>My &quot;fun with Perl&quot; application is a Web Ring of friend's sites. It's over <a
href="fs.pl">here</a>. Write <a href="mailto:crawford@enteract.com">me</a> if you want
your site included. (I'm sure I'll be deluged with requests!).</p>

<p>By popular demand: The <a href="ftp://ftp.enteract.com/users/crawford/final3.zip">300
Wilmot Road Doom world</a>. You'll need the full commercial version of Doom II to run this
bad boy. Download the final3.wad file from my ftp site
(ftp.enteract.com/users/crawford/final3.wad) put it in your Doom II directory, then run it
by typing doom2.exe -file final3.wad&nbsp;&nbsp; at the c:/ prompt. I've got to admit the
game play of the world isn't that great, but the layout is a pretty accurate. If you don't
have Doom II, get it ($14 at Computer City), try they shareware Win95 version at <a
href="http://www.idsoftware.com/archives/doomii.html">idsoftware</a>, or stop by my cube
and you can play it on my laptop (during non-working hours, of course.)</p>
