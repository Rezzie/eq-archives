		If you're a web developer (and who isn't these days), EnterAct 

		offers the following program:<BR><BR>

		

			<STRONG>Discount Accounts<BR><Br></STRONG>

		<OL>

		 <P>We'll sell you <A HREF="complete.html">CompleteAct

Accounts</A>

		  	and all the additional services for your

			clients at wholesale prices - 25% off.  In exchange for managing

			these accounts (being the first line of contact,

			handling billing, etc.), you can resell these accounts

			to your clients at whatever cost (and profit!) makes sense

			to you.<BR>

			

			<P>Pre-pay discounts <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">still</FONT>

apply!  Some

			developers pre-pay for their clients on an annual basis (a 30%

discount),

			then bill their clients monthly, giving them an even greater

profit margin.<BR>

			

			<P>The one-stop-shop concept is obviously a great marketing

tool for you.

			Your customers have the convenience of a single monthly bill. 

For you,

			it's easier to sell a monthly retainer fee in addition to hosting

fees.<BR>

			

			<P>The reality is, you own your clients.  If you have clients at

another

			ISP right now, you know that your ISP is getting their money,

and has the

			on-going business relationship with them (i.e., the opportunity

to sell

			them additional services). EnterAct reverses that

relationship.<BR>

			

			And when you grow to the point that you've got your own T1

and servers,

			we can help you make the transition.  We can still work with

you to 

			provide dedicated lines and/or dial-up services to you or your

clients.

			

			</OL>

			<BR>

		

			<P><STRONG>Co-located Servers</STRONG><BR><BR>

		

			<OL>

				

			For $250 per month you can co-locate a server on our network to

host your

			customers' CompleteAct accounts on.  This gives you the ability

to have

			unlimited disk space; the operating system of your choice;

control over

			processor performance and load (make those CGI scripts

hum!).<BR>

			

			<P>In addition, after you bring in 15 CompleteAct accounts,

we'll waive

			your co-location fees!<BR><BR>

			

			</OL>

			

			<P><STRONG>Referrals</STRONG><BR><BR>

			<OL>

			Because EnterAct doesn't compete with you for web

development business, we can send

			all those calls we get your way!<BR>
