<p><a name=area95><h3>Those Pesky Chicago Area Codes</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>If you are having trouble dialing out, the problem might lie with the
phone number you've entered.  Check for the following:
<li>Make sure that if you do not need an area code that it isn't there.  
<li>Insure that any prefix is added to the dialing string (such as 9, to
dial out of a building) if necessary.  
<li>Make sure that you dial a 1 if you are using an area code.  
<li>If you use call waiting and <font color=#bb0000>*70</font> doesn't work, try
<font color=#bb0000>*1170</font>.
</ul>

<p><a name=dns95><h3>Are the DNS Addresses Correct?</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>
DNS is a service that translates numeric Internet addresses
into easily-remembered hostnames ("enteract.com", for instance).
In order for this to work, your Internet software needs to know
the numeric address of EnterAct's domain name (DNS) servers.
<p>
If your DNS servers are specified incorrectly (or not at all),
you'll be unable to locate sites by their names, and will only
be able to talk to sites using their numeric addresses. If
one of your servers is right and any others are wrong, it will take
a long time to locate sites by their names. For the best
possible results, please make sure that you've set up your software
to use:
<p>
Primary: 207.229.143.1<br>
Secondary: 207.229.143.2

</font>
<p><a name=baud95><h3>Is the Correct Baud Rate Set?</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Try lowering your baud rate.  With some modems, if your baud rate is
too high, you may not connect well, or even at all.  If you have a 28,800
modem, try setting your baud rate to <font color=#bb0000>57,600</font> bps.  And if
you have a 14,400 modem, try setting it to <font color=#bb0000>38,400</font>.  You can
always try raising it up to 115,200 for 28.8 modems or 57,600 for 14,400 modems to see
if you can achieve faster speeds.
</font>
<p><a name=auth95><h3>Authentication Woes</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>The most obvious problem is when you've mistyped your username or
password
and you can't log in.  The username must be lower case and the password is
case sensitive.
</font>
<p><a name=phone95><h3>Try Different Phone Numbers</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>A good thing to try if things don't seem to be working right (you
aren't authenticating, or you get an IP address but can't ping) is to try
a different <a href="http://www.enteract.com/where.html">phone number</a>
on a different system. This might in fact fix
the problem.</font>
<p><a name=reboot95><h3>When All Else fails, Reboot</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Rebooting not only will reset the modem, but may fix other anomalies
with your dial-up software.  Try it, it can't hurt.
