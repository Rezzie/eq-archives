<h2><u> ENTERACT INTERNET SERVICES AGREEMENT</u></h2><br>
</center>

THIS INTERNET SERVICES AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is
entered into as of ______________, 1997 by and between EnterAct, L.L.C.,
and Illinois limited liability company ("EnterAct") located at 3227 North
Sheffield Avenue, #4R, Chicago Illinois 60657, and _________________
(the "User"), located at_______________________________

<br><br>

<center><H3>1. Services and Usage.</H3></center>

EnterAct agrees to provide to User during the term of
this Agreement the services, software and other products described on the
price sheet and other terms and conditions attached hereto or posted on
EnterAct's web site, all of which are incorporated by reference herein,
and any other services requested or used by User (collectively, the "Services").
User agrees, and User shall cause its employees using its account(s) with
EnterAct ("Account(s)"), to: (i) maintain a connection with EnterAct's
server only during active use; (ii) use the connection only for the benefit
of User and its employees; (iii) permit only User's employees the use of
Account(s) and extra mail boxes on the Account(s); (iv) cause its employees
to maintain the confidentiality of all password and other security information
relating to the Account(s); (v) not use the EnterAct link as a dedicated
connection; (vi) not use any automatic method to avoid "time-out" disconnection;
(vii) not simultaneously use more than one connection from one Account

<center><H3>2. Recurring Charges.</H3></center>
User agrees to pay all charges for Services charged pursuant
to the terms hereof. If User has authorized EnterAct to charge User's credit
card, User authorizes EnterAct to continue to charge against such credit
card on a recurring basis until receipt by EnterAct of written notice from
User withdrawing such authorization. EnterAct will invoice User via e-mail
unless User has directed EnterAct in writing that User requires conventional
written invoices. User shall pay all invoices within fifteen (15) days
after receipt thereof, whether by e-mail or conventional mail. User shall
be invoiced as of the first of each month for the recurring service charge
for such month plus usage fees for the preceding month. EnterAct reserves
the right to charge User for any invoices not paid timely a late payment
charge of $15 plus interest at one and one-half percent (1&frac12;%) per
month. User shall be responsible for providing, at its expense, all equipment
including telephone access required to use the Services.

<center><H3>3. Service Changes.</H3></center>
 EnterAct reserves the right to modify this Agreement
including, without limitation, pricing, terms of service, and dial-up locations,
upon thirty (30) days written or e-mail notice to User. User's failure
to terminate this Agreement within thirty (30) days after receipt of any
such notice constitutes User's consent to such modifications.

<center><H3>4. Termination of Service.</H3></center>
 Either party may terminate this Agreement; provided,
however, EnterAct may immediately suspend Account(s) activity at any time
if User fails to timely pay any amounts due EnterAct or in the event EnterAct,
in its sole discretion, determines that User is causing, or is reasonably
likely to cause: any change in the operation of EnterAct's business not
in the ordinary course of business; or any violation of generally accepted
guidelines on Internet usage including, without limitation, mass e-mailings,
mass advertising or posting to inappropriate news groups. User shall be
charged for Services through the effective termination date. EnterAct shall
refund to User any credit balance remaining in User's Account(s) after
deducting any amounts for damages incurred by EnterAct arising out of any
breach by User of its obligations under this Agreement. EnterAct shall
pay such refund, if any, to User within twenty (20) days after the effective
termination date. Set-up and start-up fees are not refundable.

<center><H3>5. Warranty Disclaimer and Release.</H3></center>

or images.

<center><H3>6. Indemnification.</H3></center>
 (a) User agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
EnterAct from and against any Damages (excluding, however, lost profits
and other consequential damages) incurred by EnterAct arising out of or

the Services including, without limitation, the Internet.
<BR> (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in Paragraph 5, EnterAct agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
User for any Damages (excluding, however, lost profits and other consequential
damages) incurred by User arising out of or resulting from EnterAct's material
breach of the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, EnterAct's maximum cumulative
liability to User shall be limited to the amounts paid to EnterAct by User
during the twelve months preceding the date of the event giving rise to
the claim for Damages.
<BR> (c) The term "Damages" shall refer to all liabilities,
costs, expenses, claims (including, without limitation, third party claims),
judgments, inconveniences, lawsuits, and attorneys' fees and court costs.

<center><H3>7. Arbitration.</H3></center>
 EnterAct and User agree that any and all disputes arising
out of or relating to this Agreement shall be submitted to final and binding
arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association;
provided, however, any action seeking immediate equitable relief such as
a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction may be brought
in any court of law, subject to the venue provisions in the succeeding
paragraph. The parties agree that any award of an arbitrator selected according
to the "Rules of Arbitration" as defined by the American Arbitration Association,
shall be binding upon them as if rendered by a court of law and will be
enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.

<center><H3>8. Governing Law and Venue.</H3></center>

 The rights and obligations of each party hereto shall
inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns
of such party. EnterAct may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to any purchaser of substantially all of its assets or other
successor to its business. User agrees to comply with all laws and regulations
in connection with the use of the Services, its Account(s) and the Internet
including, without limitation, copyright laws. This Agreement is not intended
to confer any benefits on any person not a party hereto. No party shall
bring any claim hereunder unless it has provided written notice to the
other party describing the nature of the claim in reasonable detail and
the complaining party has attempted to negotiate in good faith with the
other party for thirty (30) days in order to resolve such claim; provided,
however, such obligation shall not apply to EnterAct's right to immediately
suspend Account activity as provided in paragraph 0 above.

<center><H3>10. Force Majeure.</H3></center>
 The term "Force Majeure" shall mean any and all causes
beyond the reasonable control of EnterAct which prevents EnterAct from
performing any of its obligations hereunder, including but not limited
to, acts of God, labor disputes, boycotts, fires, explosions, floods, breakdowns
of or damage to plants, equipment or facilities, network outages, network
inaccessibility, denial of service attacks, acts of civil, judicial or
military authorities, acts of governmental authorities or other causes
of a similar nature. If, because of any Force Majeure, EnterAct is unable
to carry out a material element of its obligations under this Agreement
and if EnterAct shall notify User of such Force Majeure, then EnterAct's
obligations shall be suspended to the extent made necessary by such Force
Majeure. During the period of such suspension, the obligations of the User
shall be suspended or reduced, as appropriate.
