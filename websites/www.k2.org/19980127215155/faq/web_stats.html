<h1>How do I get my web stats?</h1>
</center>
<hr width=55%>
<br>
Once upon a time, you could search through the main httpd access_log
to find the entries corresponding to your page.  However, to protect
the privacy of our fellow customers, we've decided to do this for you.
(It also saves you the bother).

<p>

If you'd like to see how many hits your home page is getting, check
out the directory <font color="#000000"><tt>~/web_logs</tt></font>
<font color="#d00000">(or </font> <font
color="#900000">~/vhost_yourdomain.com/http-logs/</font> <font
color="#d00000"> if you are a CompleteAct customer).</font> 

<p>

Each SoloAct customer with a home page gets a weekly statistics
summary of all access to their web page, as well as all raw log files
apropos their page.  The files will appear in your ~/web_logs directory
around 3:30am on Saturday mornings if there was any traffic to your site
in the past week.

<p>

CompleteAct customers get stats pages generated with the frequency
that they have specified that they wish their log files to roll.  If
you haven't specified that you want your web logs to roll, no stats
will be generated.  You specify that you want your CompleteAct stats
to roll by placing a file called <font
color="#000000"><tt>.roll</tt></font> in your <font
color="#000000"><tt>~/vhost_yourdomain.com/http-logs</tt></font>
directory, containing either the word <font
color="#000000"><tt>daily</tt></font>, <font
color="#000000"><tt>weekly</tt></font> or <font
color="#000000"><tt>monthly</tt></font>, depending on how frequently you 
want to logs to roll.

<p>
If people have accessed your site before you created the .roll file, the 
statistics for those hits will not be generated on the first, or any subsequent, 
time that <i>Analog</i> is run.  Only hits since creating the .roll file will show up
in your statistics.  You can, however, run the following command
in order to generate statistics on the access.log file that was kept prior to your
creating the .roll file:
<p>
<b>analog -n"yourdomain.com" &lt;logfile name&gt &gt stats.html</b>
<p>
Replace &lt;logfile name&gt with the name of your log; probably access.log.
This will generate
statistics on your access.log file and put them in a file called stats.html.  Move this file
to your http-docs directory with the following command:
<p>
<b>mv stats.html ~username/vhost_domain.com/http-docs</b>
<p>
You can then view this log by entering the following URL in your web browser:
<p>
<b>www.yourdomain.com/stats.html</b>


<p>

Your raw access log file will look something like this:

<font color="#000000"><pre>
dialin_6.enteract.com - - [12/Jul/1996:02:38:08 -0500] "GET /~foo/ HTTP/1.0" 200 2027
dialin_6.enteract.com - - [12/Jul/1996:07:34:50 -0500] "GET /~foo/foo.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 3500
gw.att.com - - [12/Jul/1996:07:57:35 -0500] "GET /~foo/foo.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 3500
</pre></font>

The access_log lists every individual retrieval of a page in your web
space.  The requesting host, time, file request, status code and file size
(respectively) are logged.

<p>

The file <font color="#000000">stats-mm-dd-yy.html</font> (<font color
= "#d00000">www-stats-mm-dd-yy.html, for CompleteAct customers</font>)
contains the results of running the log analyzer program "analog" on
your access log.  It is formatted in HTML.  If you want to see it in
your web browser, copy it to your public_html directory and change the
permissions so that it is readable by everyone <font
color="#000000"><tt>chmod a+r stats-&lt;date&gt;.html</tt></font> (or
FTP it to your home computer) and fire it up in your web browser.

stats-&lt;date&gt; will look something like this:

<pre><font color="#000000">
[...some header material...]
<b>Total completed requests:</b> 23
<b>Average completed requests per day:</b> 7
<b>Total failed requests:</b> 1
<b>Number of distinct hosts served:</b> 6
<b>Total data transferred:</b> 135 455 bytes
<b>Average data transferred per day:</b> 43 981 bytes
[...Followed by listings of your more popular pages, and other fun stuff...]
</font></pre>
