<BR><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, if you have gotten
this far, you either know us or are just extremely lucky to have found
us.&nbsp; In either case, welcome.&nbsp; Since this page will be forever
evolving, please come back and visit often.&nbsp; We have some ideas in
the works and just can't wait to get them up and running.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though this is our
page, it also shares space with what we like to call the Banana Computer
Company.&nbsp; If you were an avid reader of the cartoon Bloom County,
then you know about the sometimes quirky computer of Oliver Wendell Jones,
the Banana Jr.&nbsp; I have always liked that name and when I began tinkering
with mine as well as other peoples computers, I adopted that name.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I just let you
go gallivanting around this page, may we take a minute for a commercial
from our host:</FONT>

Celtic Knot Forge</A></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run by friends of ours,
Franklyn and Karen Garland out of their Brookfield, IL home as well as
their shop at the Bristol Renaissance Faire during the summer, the Celtic
Knot produces some of the finest metal crafts anywhere.&nbsp; From hand
hewn nails and sweet sounding triangles to coffee tables and curtain rods,
the "<I>Knot"</I> is where Old World craftsmanship still lives!&nbsp; Frank
is also my major consultant on this web page as well as the one for the
First United Methodist Church - Lansing, IL.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>

link.&nbsp; Kenland is run by a good friend of ours, Mary McCauley, DVM.&nbsp;
She is the lady that bred our pride and joy, Jonah.&nbsp; She is a good
source for pictures and information about Maine Coon cats as well as one
of the best veterinarians we have ever had the pleasure to meet.&nbsp;
(P.S. It was her page that I got the dancing cat at the top of this page
from.)&nbsp; Mary actually has two pages, one doing with cats, that other
deals with he second favorite pastime, genealogy.</FONT>
