<OL>
		<P>We have a little dream.  We know EnterAct is a great ISP.  
		All right, we're a little biased.  But our dream is that we'd
		be such a great ISP for web developers that you'd line up to
		sign up.  <BR>
		
		<P>In talking to some of our clients, we've found that
		most web developers would like some combination of the following:<BR>
		<BR>
		<OL><STRONG>
			<LI> An ISP that's responsive, quality-oriented, reliable, and 
				knowledgeable;  in short, a ISP you'd feel comfortable
				recommending to your clients.<BR><BR>
			<LI> A chance to be a <FONT COLOR="#DD0000">one-stop-shop</FONT> for your customers.<BR><BR>
			<LI> An ISP that refers business to you.<BR><BR>
			<LI> An ISP that does not compete with your company.<BR><BR>
			<LI> A way to make it worthwhile (i.e. profitable) to host your clients' sites.<BR><BR>
		</STRONG></OL><BR>
		
		We've developed a program that we feel does all this and more.  If you're 
		interested in hearing more, call us at (312) 248-8511, or email us at
		<A HREF="mailto:webdev@enteract.com">webdev@enteract.com</A>.  We'll give
		you a username and a password, then you can return here for all the juicy details.
