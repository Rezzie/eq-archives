<H1>Our Philosophy</H1>
<BR><BR>
<P>This might seem a little corny, but we feel
it's extremely important for us to state,
unequivocably, our beliefs, our plans and
our intentions to our customers.<BR>

<BR>
<P>So here they are:
<OL>

    <P><LI> <FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Individual</FONT> -  We believe in the individual's ability
  	to excel beyond their own expectations.  If properly 
  	motivated and inspired, we can all do extraordinary
  	things. We want to do them daily.<BR>
     
    <P><LI> <FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Honesty</FONT> - We will be honest with our customers and
  	to each other.<BR>
  
    <P><LI> <FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Commitment</FONT> - We are committed to providing the
  	best possible service to our customers.<BR>
     
    <P><LI> <FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Passion</FONT> - We are passionate about what we do.<BR>
  
    <P><LI> <FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Humor</FONT> - We maintain a sense of humor.  Work should
  	be fun!<BR>
  
    <P><LI> <FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Expensive</FONT> - It only costs a little bit more to go 
  	first class.  When faced with a decision directly affecting our customers, 
  	we choose to spend a little 
  	bit more to improve service.  We'll make it up in volume,
  	right?<BR>
     
   <P><LI> <FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Inexpensive</FONT> - Where customer service is not affected, 
  	we strive to minimize expenses.  This will ensure that 
  	we're around for our customers in the future.<BR>
       
    <P><LI> <FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Rewards</FONT> - We believe in rewarding hard work and 
  	results.  All employees have a significant stake in 
  	the overall success of EnterAct, L.L.C.<BR>
     
    <P><LI> <FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Privacy</FONT> - We have absolute respect for the 
  	privacy of our customers and each other.<BR>
     
   <P><LI> <FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Customers</FONT> - Most of all, we believe that our 
  	customers should be so fanatical about our service 
  	and our respect for them that they become our most 
  	powerful marketing force.<BR>
