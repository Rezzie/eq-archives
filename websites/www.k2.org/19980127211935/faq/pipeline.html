<p>This page is an excerpt out of the Ascend Pipeline 50 manual. They have
a form which you fill out with information from the telco and your ISP
(That's Us!). The information from us is filled out here so you have what 
you need to set up your Pipeline 50. Please have an 
ascii terminal hooked up to the serial port so that it is ready to
configure.</p>

<P>When finished configuring your Pipeline, save the configuration. 
You will have to assign an IP address in your subnet for your computer. 
The IP address for your Ascend box is the gateway. <p>

To dial, you can hit control-d and 1 on your keyboard.
Alternatively, when you open any internet application, the Pipeline should
dial automatically for you.
