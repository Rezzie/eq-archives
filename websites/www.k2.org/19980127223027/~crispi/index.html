<font size="+1">M</font>y name is Crispina Chong, </a><a
href="images/crisnew.jpg">Crispi</a> for short, and I am from <a
href="http://www.interknowledge.com/malaysia/myklin01.htm">Kuala Lumpur</a>,
the capital city of <a
href="http://www.interknowledge.com/malaysia/">Malaysia</a>.

<p>
At this point I am graduating from </a><a
href="http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</a> with a B.Sc. in
Journalism and Mass Communications (emphasis in Public Relations).  I think
my guardian angel who has been watching over me all my life has done her job
once again, because yet another wonderful thing has happened to me: I have
a job right out of graduation at a prestigious PR agency in Chicago and I
will be moving there in a week.
<p>
Some would say I deserved it as I *did* put in a bit of work in getting a
job, but as always, things like this strike me as providential.  Anyhow,
believing that someone's watching over me is a comforting thought, and I
hope and plan to make the most out of the opportunity that's been given me.
<p>
Philosophizing aside, I'm excited about the life I'm going to and sad about
the life I'll be leaving behind.  Well, maybe not *that* sad.. I can't say
I'll miss the homework, but I'll definitely miss my friends and the learning
environment here.
<p>
Some of the things I can look back on:<br>
<li>Arriving in Ames in the middle of the night and taking a cold shower
because I wasn't smart enough to turn the knob all the way 'round *shiver*
<li>Losing a childhood friend to a silly fight
<li>Finding new lifelong friends
<li>Waking up to country music every morning *shudder*
<li>Getting hooked on the internet and IRC *grin* (yeah yeah I know)
<li>Roadtripping to meet some of these IRC people
<li>The 40-hour Greyhound bus trip to and from Santa Ana for Christmas '94
and the visit to Chinatown with an IRC friend for a guide
<li>Living in a house with my closest friends one summer and breaking my
front teeth in a biking accident
<li>Learning to ballroom dance (and some salsa, merengue and tango too!)
<li>My escapades with men (oy!)
<li>Squeezing out a column for the college paper every week of a semester
<li>Conquering my stuffy nose under the tutelage of voice teacher Mr. Tener
(well, almost)
<p>
And countless other things that one can do in three years at college.. (I'm
terrible at conclusions so I'll leave this here for now :oP).
