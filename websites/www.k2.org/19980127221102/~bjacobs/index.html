Summary:
Welcome! The Great River Rumble is an annual canoe trip down the
Mississippi River, approximately the last week of July. 
Participants travel by canoe or kayak. The trip is about 130 miles long
over seven days of paddling. We paddle by day and camp in tents by
night. Gear is transported by truck from campsite to campsite.
Meals are in local restaurants or catered. Those paddlers who
cannot paddle the entire trip are welcome to join in for even just
one of these days.
