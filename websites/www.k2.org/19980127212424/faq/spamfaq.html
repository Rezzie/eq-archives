<p><font color="#110860"><h3>What is Spam?</h3></font>

<p>Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), or "spam," is email sent for the purposes
of advertising a product or service without the consent of the recipient. "Spammers"
compile lists of email addresses that they have culled from posts to Usenet
newsgroups, Internet mailing lists, or just by saerching the Web, and send a single
message to everyone on their list. The most common types of spam advertize get rich
quick schemes, products of dubious quality, and web sites dedicated to pornography.
Usually, the spammer will substitute a fake email address for their own, forge other
header fields in the email, and place their list of addresses in the Bcc: (Blind
carbon copy) field so that it is not visible to the recipients.

<p>So how is this different from the paper "junk" mail we're all used to receiving?
You just throw it out and have done with it, right?

<p>Spam works a little differently. With snail-mail (i.e., the kind you get from the
US Post Office), the person sending the mail bears the burden of the costs of its
delivery (postage). Email is maintained and paid for by the recipient. You pay for
your account, for disk spage, and for connection time. Spam takes up space and takes
time for you to download. You bear the burden of paying for mail that you did not
request.

<p>Sending UCE, or "spamming" as we savvy netizens call it, is strictly prohibited
by EnterAct's <a href="http://www.enteract.com/~jdm">Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</a>. Such activity will result in the termination of the offending account.
Nonetheless, despite our anti-spam policies, EnterAct will not block mail from any
domains, be they known spam domains or not. We do not believe in filtering or
censoring our customers' email.


<p>If you need even more reasons to get your dander up about spam, take a look
at <a href="http://spam.abuse.net">spam.abuse.net</a>. This site contains a wealth
of information about spam and efforts to curtail it.

<p><font color="#110860"><h3>What can I do about Spam?</h3></font>

<p>There isn't much you can do about the spammers themselves, but there are some
measures you can take to keep spam from filling up your mailbox.

<ul>

<li><b>Be careful with your email address.</b> Spammers have a variety of tools at
their disposal that can cull email addresses from Usenet postings and Web pages.
Keep in mind that not every form or guestbook you fill out on the web will keep the
information you submit private. Also, when posting on Usenet, it can be useful to
have your email address in a "coded" form, such as <tt>johnNOSPAM@enteract.com</tt>
or <tt>mary"at"enteract"dot"com</tt>, with instructions for "decoding" in your
signature, e.g., "Remove NOSPAM to reply."

<li><b>Never reply to spam!</b> Many spam mailings will give you the option to get
off their list by replying to the message with the word "remove" in your subject or
some other such nonsense. Think about it; why should you have to ask to be removed
from a list you never asked to join? This is usually just a way for the spammer to
confirm that yours is a valid address, and then you just end up getting more spam!

<li><b>Use email filtering software.</b> A number of email clients, such as <a
href="http://www.eudora.com">Eudora Pro</a>, <a
href="http://www.pegasus.usa.com">Pegasus Mail</a>, and
<a href="http://www.forteinc.com">Agent</a>, allow you to filter mail from specific
domains, or mail not addressed specifically to you, into different directories. This
way you can weed out the spam from your real mail. There are also some anti-spam
software products that auto-reply with cautionary messages (e.g., "Leave me alone or
I'll sue!"). As stated above, this is generally a bad idea, doing you more harm than
good.

<li><b>Set up a procmail script.</b> <a
href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/workshops/procmail/">procmail</a> is a mail handling
program that you can use by setting up a procmail script, or "recipie," in your home
directory here on our shell machine. Luckily, EnterAct's admins have already
concocted a procmail script that will filter out mail from known spam domains. The
script references a file called <tt>cyberpromo.domains</tt>, which comtains a list
of domains used by spammers. Our script will comapre the headers of all your
incoming mail to this list, and any mail containing these domains in its
headers will be sent to a <tt>/dev/null</tt> directory (i.e., they will never reach
your mailbox). The script also keeps a log in your home directory, called
<tt>procmail.log</tt>, that lists all mail filered by procmail and whether it was
sent to your mailbox or to <tt>/dev/null</tt>.
<p>Here's how to set it up:

	<p>
	<ol>
	<li>Telnet to <font color="bb0000">shell.enteract.com</font>.
	<li>Create a file named <tt>.forward</tt> in your home directory. You can do
this by typing <tt><font color="#bb0000">pico .forward</font></tt> at the command
prompt. This will open a text editor (called pico) and let you edit the file. Once
in the editor, type the following:
<p><font color="#110860">
<tt>&quot;|IFS=' '&&exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f-||exit 75
#USERNAME&quot;</tt>
</font>
<p>Remember to inculde the quotation marks and replace <tt>USERNAME</tt> with your
username. When finished, hit <font color="#bb0000">Ctrl-X</font> to save the file.
	<li>Next, create a file called <tt>.procmailrc</tt> by typing <font
color="#bb0000"><tt>pico .procmailrc</tt></font> at the command prompt. The file
should contain the following:
<p>
<font color="#110860">
<pre>
VERBOSE=off
LOGFILE=$HOME/procmail.log
LINEBUF=10240

CPDOM=`cat /home/username/cyberpromo.domains`

:0 Hir
* $^(From|Sender|X-Sender|Received|Reply-to|Return-Path):.*${CPDOM}
/dev/null

:0 Hir
* $^TO_.*${CPDOM}
/dev/null

:0 Hir
* $^Comments:.*Authenticated.sender.*${CPDOM}
/dev/null

:0
/var/mail/username
</pre>
</font>

Remember to replace any instances of <tt>username</tt> above with your
username.<p>&nbsp;

	<li>Next, you'll need to copy the <tt>cyberpromo.domains</tt> file into your
home directory. To do this type <font color="#bb0000"><tt>cd
/usr/local/etc</tt></font> at the command prompt. You will now be in the
<tt>/usr/local/etc</tt> directory, where  <tt>cyberpromo.domains</tt> is located.
Type <font color="#bb0000"><tt>cp cyberpromo.domains ~/</tt></font> at the command
prompt. This will copy the <tt>cyberpromo.domains</tt> file to your home directory. 
To get back to your home directory, type <font color="#bb0000"><tt>cd ~</tt></font> 
at the command prompt.
	<li>You now have all the pieces of procmail in place! Now all of your mail
will be filtered according ot the script. If you find that you are getting spam from
domains not listed in <tt>cyberpromo.domains</tt>, you can add them to the file by
typing <font color="#bb0000"><tt>pico cyberpromo.domains</tt></font>, and adding
those domains to the list.
	</ol>
	<p>

<li><b>The Spam Bouncer.</b>You can also find another "spam-bouncing" procmail
recipie <a href="http://www.best.com/~ariel/nospam/"> here</a>.
<li><b>Notify the spammer's ISP.</b> You can learn to decipher email headers <a
href="http://ddi.digital.net/~gandalf/spamfaq.html">here</a>. You can then send
email to <font color="#bb0000">postmaster@</font> or <font
color="#bb0000">abuse@</font> the isp in question. Spamming is against the
Acceptable Use Policies (AUP) of most ISPs, and conseuqently, will often get their
account terminated once brought to their ISP's attention.
