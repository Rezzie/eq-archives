<h3>Winsock.dll</h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>If you have several applications which use your modem (e.g. AOL or
Trumpet Winsock), chances are very good that you will have more than one
instance of <font color=#bb0000><code>winsock.dll</code></font> on your
hard drive. If this is the
case, it could cause problems 
for you when you try to connect to EnterAct.  If you find that it looks
like you connect, but then cannot go to any web page, retrieve mail,
or read news, it is possible that you have more than one of these files
and they are conflicting.
<p>To solve this, do a search for <font
color=#bb0000><code>winsock.dll</code></font> from your file
manager or from within DOS with the <font color=#bb0000><code>C:\>dir /s
winsock.dll</code></font>
command.  You should have one in your Netscape directory.  Any others
should be renamed to <font color=#bb0000><code>winsock.old</code></font>.
</font>
<h3>Baud Rate</h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Try lowering your baud rate.  With some modems, if your baud rate is
too high, you may not connect well, or even at all.  If you have a 28,800
modem, try setting your baud rate to <font color=#bb0000>57,600</font> 
bps. And if you have a 14,400
modem, try setting it to <font color=#bb0000>38,400</font>.  You can
always try raising it up to
115,200 for 28.8 modems or 57,600 for 14,400 modems to see if you can
achieve faster speeds.
</font>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<font color=#000000>
<ol>
<li>All of the configuration settings for Netscape P.E. can be found by
double clicking the <font color=#bb0000>Connection</font> icon and going
to the <font color=#bb0000>Properties</font> button.
<li>If you are switching from another provider, however, it may be easier
to edit the <font color=#bb0000><code>myaccoun.sr</code></font> file.
(Note: this file may actually be called
something else.  You may have <code>isp.sr</code>,
<code>enteract.sr</code>, <code>internet.sr</code>, or
something else.  The <code>netscape.sr</code> and <code>default.sr</code>
should be left alone.)
<li>To edit this file, go into DOS.
<li>Type: <font color=#bb0000><code>cd \netscape\dialer</code></font>
<li>Type: <font color=#bb0000><code>dir *.sr</code></font>.  This will
give you a listing of your
<code>.sr</code> files.
<li>Type: <font color=#bb0000><code>edit myaccount.sr</code></font> 
(again, replace <code>myaccount.sr</code> with whatever your
<code>.sr</code> file is called.)  
</ol>

<p>Here is what that file should look like:

<h3>Are the DNS Addresses Correct?</h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>
DNS is a service that translates numeric Internet addresses
into easily-remembered hostnames ("enteract.com", for instance).
In order for this to work, your Internet software needs to know
the numeric address of EnterAct's domain name (DNS) servers.
<p>
If your DNS servers are specified incorrectly (or not at all),
you'll be unable to locate sites by their names, and will only
be able to talk to sites using their numeric addresses. If
one of your servers is right and any others are wrong, it will take
a long time to locate sites by their names. For the best
possible results, please make sure that you've set up your software
to use:
<p>
Primary: 207.229.143.1<br>
Secondary: 207.229.143.2
</font>
<h3>Microsoft Office in the Startup Group</h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Netscape tech support claims that having Microsoft Office in the startup group can prevent Netscape from working.  While we have no idea why, we're inclined to believe them.
