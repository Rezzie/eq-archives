<ol>
<li>If you don't have it already, download Eudora from <A HREF="HTTP://www.eudora.com" 
target="_top">www.eudora.com</A>.  
<li>Save it to its own folder or directory on your hard drive.  You can
call this new folder or directory "Eudora".
<li>Run the executable program you downloaded by double clicking on the file in File Manager.<br>
<li>The program will start to install itself onto your hard drive.  You will see a couple of welcome screens. 
You will have to click "Next" to pass them.
<li>You will see a screen that asks you to accept the Eudora license agreement.  Click <font color=#bb0000>Yes</font>.
<li>Choose the directory where you would like to install Eudora.  If you are unsure, just accept the default path.
<li>You will then see the following screen:

<li>Choose the 16 bit version for Windows 3.X.
<li>When the install program finishes, please run Eudora from the icon that is created by double clicking it.  
<li>Go to <font color=#bb0000>Tools/Options</font> from the main menu.  You will see the following screen:<br>

</center>
<p>
<li>Fill in your <font color=#bb0000>POP account</font> and <font color=#bb0000>Real Name</font> as shown above.  
The POP account must be in the form of <font color=#bb0000>username@pop.enteract.com</font>. 
<li>Your Real Name is simply your name, or how you want your name to appear on your messages.
<li>The connection method you use should be <font color=#bb0000>Winsock</font>
<li>When done with that, click <font color=#bb0000>Personal Information</font> in the menu on the left side of your 
<font color=#bb0000>Options</font> window.<br>

<p>
<li>The <font color=#bb0000>POP account</font> and <font color=#bb0000>Real 
name</font> should already be there from the information you entered in the 
previous screen.  You will need to enter your <font color=#bb0000>Return 
Address</font>, which is the same as your email address.  It will take the 
form of <font color=#bb0000>username@enteract.com</font>. 
<li>The <font color=#bb0000>Dialup username</font> is your username.
<li>Click <font color=#bb0000>Hosts</font> when done.<br>
<p>

<p>
<li>The <font color=#bb0000>POP account</font> will already be there.  Fill in the SMTP field with <font color=#bb0000>smtp.enteract.com</font>.  Leave Ph and Finger blank.

<p>

</center>
<p>
<li>Make sure that <font color=#bb0000>Leave mail on server</font> is not checked.  This way, mail will
not stack up on the server, creating problems for you in the future.  Note, however, that if you need
to access your mail from more than one machine, you will need to leave the mail on the server.  
All other options are up to you.
<li>Click <font color=#bb0000>OK</font>.

<p>
<li>If you are properly connected to the internet, and all of your settings
are configured as described above, you will now be able to get your mail
off of EnterAct's server to read it. 
<li> Simply double click the
message you wish to read and it will appear in a separate window.</font>

<li>You will see another window which prompts you for who you are sending your message to and the subject of your message.  
In addition, there is space to compose your message.<br>

sent immediately.</font>

<p><a name=faulteudora><h3>General Protection Fault in Eudora</h3></a>
<p><font color=#000000>On rare occasions, you may get a general protection 
fault error when running Eudora.  Qualcomm, the makers of Eudora, say that 
this happens after receipt of a file with a "bad date".  The solution is to 
delete the <code>elmoff.dat</code> file (located in the Eudora subdirectory).  
The only possible negative consequence to this is that if you have been leaving
mail on the server, the next time Eudora connects it will download all
of that mail again.</font>
