<p><a name=mieauto><h3>Entering windows automatically and autoexec.bat</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>This following section cures a great many problems and errors with this software and should be checked first if you get any strange errors or cannot connect with us.  If you go into windows or some menu right after booting up, you will need to edit 
your <font color=#bb0000><code>autoexec.bat</code></font> file after
installing this software. There are 4 lines
that are appended to the end of this file that will not be loaded if windows or a menu are loaded first.
<p>Here are the four lines:
<P>
<font color=#bb0000>
<code>SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\IEXPLORE\mail</code>
<br><code>SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\IEXPLORE</code>
<br><code>set ieppp=c:\IEXPLORE</code>
<br><code>set pctcp=c:\IEXPLORE\pctcp.shv</code>
</font>
<p>Move these above the <font color=#bb0000><code>c:\windows</code></font> 
statement in the
<font color=#bb0000><code>autoexec.bat</code></font> file or move the
<font color=#bb0000><code>c:\windows</code></font>
statement below these lines.   You should then be able to reboot and
double click on the <font color=#bb0000>Get me on the Internet</font> icon
to obtain your EnterAct dialer icon.
</font>
<p><a name=miewinsock><h3>Winsock.dll</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>If you have several applications which use your modem (e.g. AOL or
Trumpet Winsock), chances are very good that you will have more than one
instance of <font color=#bb0000><code>winsock.dll</code></font> on your
hard drive. If this is the case, it could cause problems  when you try to 
connect to EnterAct.  If you find that it looks like you connect, but then cannot go to any web page, retrieve mail, or read news, it is possible that you have more than one of these files and they are conflicting.
<p>To solve this, do a search for <font
color=#bb0000><code>winsock.dll</code></font> from your file
manager or from within DOS with the <font color=#bb0000><code>C:\>dir /s
winsock.dll</code></font> command.  You should have one in your iexplore
or windows directory.  Any others should be renamed to 
<font color=#bb0000><code>winsock.old</code></font>.
</font>
<p><a name=miedisk1><h3>Disk 1</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Sometimes after installing Disk 1 of the 3 disk set, the disk becomes useless because all of the filenames are changed and all of the sizes of the files are set to be about 4 gig!    To prevent this, copy this disk to your hard drive in a separate 
directory before installation.
</font>
<p><a name=miebaud><h3>Baud Rate</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Try lowering your baud rate.  With some modems, if your baud rate is
too high, you may not connect well, or even at all.  If you have a 28,800
modem, try setting your baud rate to <font color=#bb0000>57,600</font> 
bps. And if you have a 14,400
modem, try setting it to <font color=#bb0000>38,400</font>.  You can
always try raising it up to
115,200 for 28.8 modems or 57,600 for 14,400 modems to see if you can
achieve faster speeds.
<p>The baud rate setting can be found by double clicking on the EnterAct dialer icon and clicking Properties.  There is a modem tab that will show the maximum speed for the connection.
</font>
<p><a name=mieinit><h3>Init String</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>There is no obvious setting where you can change your initialization
string.  What you will have to do is edit the <font
color=#bb0000><code>modems2.ini</code></font> file. This
file should have two lines; one that lists your modem and one that lists the init string.  If you are having 
trouble being able to dial out, change it to <font
color=#bb0000>AT&F</font>, <font color=#bb0000>AT&F1</font>, or simply
<font color=#bb0000>ATZ</font>. </font>
<p><a name=miestartover><h3>Starting Over</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>If you need to completely re-install this software, there are a few things you'll have to delete before you do so.
<p><ol>
<li>In the <code><font color=#bb0000>system.ini</font></code> file there
are two lines that begin with <font
color=#bb0000><code>device=c:\iexplore\…</code></font> These should be
deleted.
<li>Delete the entirety of the <font
color=#bb0000><code>iexplore</code></font> directory.
<li>In the Windows directory, delete <font
color=#bb0000><code>iexplore.*.</code></font>  
<li>In the Windows directory there is also a <font
color=#bb0000><code>signup</code></font> directory. Delete it.
<li>Delete the 4 lines in the <font
color=#bb0000><code>autoexec.bat</code></font> file that mention
<code>iexplore</code>.
</ol>
<p>With all of these things deleted, you are ready to re-install the software.
