<p><a name=dial><h3>Does Your Modem Dial Properly?</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p><h4><b>Is the Modem Turned On?</b></h4>
Make sure that your modem is on and that your phone line is going into the
line port on your modem.
<p><h4><b>Those Pesky Chicago Area Codes</b></h4>
If you get a message that says something about the remote server not 
responding, chances are that the problem lies with the dialing properties.  
Make sure that if you do not need an area code that it isn't there.  In 
addition, you need to ensure that any prefix is added to the dialing string 
(such as 9,) if necessary.  There is a place in the dialing properties to
set this prefix, so it is not necessary to put it directly in the phone number.
Also, make sure that you dial a 1 if you are using an area code.  
<p><h4><b>Call Waiting Enabled?</b></h4>
If you have call waiting, disabling it might cause problems dialing out.
If you dial "*70," in front of the phone number and find you have problems
dialing properly, try "1170," instead.
<p><h4><b>More Than One Installed Modem?</b></h4>
If you can't even get your modem to dial, check to make sure that you
are set to the correct com port (in the Modems control panel) and don't
have the wrong modem selected.  Many times people unwittingly install more 
than one modem (i.e. they install a "Standard" modem and then they find the 
real drivers for their modem and install that before removing the other) and 
have selected the wrong one.  Make sure this isn't the case.
<p><h4><b>Are You Letting Internet Explorer Dial Your Connection?</b></h4>
If your modem refuses to dial when you let internet applications like
Internet Explorer or Netscape dial your connection for you, there are a 
couple of things you want to check.
<ol>
<li>Right click <font color=#bb0000>"The Internet"</font> icon located on
your desktop and select <font color=#bb0000>Properties</font>.  Do you
have "Connect to the Internet as needed" checked?  If not, check it.
<li>If the checkbox in step 1 is checked and you still have the same
problems, try dialing with your connection icon in Dial-Up Networking
(it's probably called "EnterAct") normally.  The next time you
want to connect to us after that, try letting Internet Explorer or some
other internet application bring up your dialer.  It *should* work.  It
seems that if you have ever cold or hard booted your machine while still
connected, the setting somehow gets lost to dial on demand.  
</ol>
</font>
<p><a name=connect><h3>Do You Successfully Log In and Stay In?</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p><h4><b>Is the Correct Baud Rate Set?</b></h4>
Try lowering your baud rate.  With some modems, if your baud rate is
too high, you may not connect well, or even at all.  If you have a 28,800
modem, try setting your baud rate to 57,600 bps.  And if you have a 14,400
modem, try setting it to 38,400.  You can always try raising it up to
115,200 for 28.8 modems or 57,600 for 14,400 modems to see if you can
achieve faster speeds.
<p>Now, there are two places that the baud rate appears.  The first is in the 
modems icon in the control panel.  Go to the Modem Properties and verify the 
baud rate.  The second place that you need to look is in the properties of the 
EnterAct icon (right click the icon from dial-up networking and select 
properties).  Go to the Configure button.  Verify the baud rate.
<p><h4><b>Authentication Woes</b></h4>
The most obvious problem is when you've mistyped your username or password 
and you can't log in.  The username must be lower case and the password is 
case sensitive.
<p>Now there is an occasion where you will not authenticate, but your
username and password is correct.  To fix this, do a find on *.pwl.
Remove all of these files and reboot.  When prompted for a username and 
password from Windows 95 on bootup, enter the same username you use for
us.  You need not enter a password; just click the "cancel" button.  This
seems to be a problem only with the TCG (digital) lines at the moment.  It
shouldn't occur with the MFS (analog) numbers.
<p><h4><b>"Save Password" field grey</b></h4>
There is a bug in Windows95 that sometimes does not allow you to select
the save password option.
<p>
To correct this, go to the <font color=#bb0000>Control Panel</font>.
<ol>
<li>Double click the <font color=#bb0000>Passwords</font> icon.  
<li>Select <font color=#bb0000>User Profiles</font>.
<li>Change the setting to <font color=#bb0000>Users can customize their
preferences...</font>.
<li>Restart Windows.
</ol><p>
You will be required to enter a username and password when you start
Windows again.  Go ahead and put in your EnterAct username and
password if there isn't another username or password that you typically
use. This will create a PWL file that will allow you to save your password
in Dial-Up Networking.
<p><h4><b>Try Different Phone Numbers</b></h4>
A good thing to try if things don't seem to be working right (you 
aren't authenticating, or you get an IP address but can't ping) is to try 
a different <a href="http://www.enteract.com/where.html">phone number</a>
on a different system. This might in fact fix the problem.
<p><h4><b>Change the MTU size</b></h4>
Changing the default MTU size in Windows 95 can prevent disconnects and
slow connections.  Because knowing how to change this setting isn't intuitive, follow
these next few steps:
<ol>
<li>Go to your Start button and select <font color=#b0000>Run</font>.
<li>Type <font color=#bb0000>regedit</font>
<li>Select 
<font color=#bb0000>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\NetTrans</font>
<li>At this point, you may see a directory called 0000, 0001 and/or 0002.
If you have a 0002, select it.  If not, select the next highest directory
you have.
<li>You will need to add a field.  Go to your 
<font color=#bb0000>Edit</font> pull-down menu and choose 
<font color=#bb0000>New/String Value</font>.  
<li>You will see a new entry appear on the right hand side of the
registry.  In the field that you have just added, type 
<font color=#bb0000>MaxMTU</font> and hit your <font
color=#bb0000>Enter</font> key.
<li>Now double click that entry.
<li>A dialog box will appear where you can enter a value.  Enter <font
color=#bb0000>576</font>.  
<li>That should help.  If not, experiment with changing that value to 1500
and see which is better for you.</ol>

Fix.</a>
<p><h4><b>Download the Kernel32 Patch</b></h4>
Do you ever get the dreaded "Can't negotiate compatible set of network
protocols.." error when dialing into EnterAct even though the very same
connection has worked countless times in past and you haven't changed a
darned thing? Well, this error is due to a memory leak in Windows
95.  Downloading the Kernel32 patch from Microsoft may very well
solve your problem.  Go to 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/krnlupd.htm" target="_top">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/krnlupd.htm</a> and install it.
Good luck!
</font> 
<p><a name=ping><h3>Can You Access Any Web Pages?</h3></a> 
<font color=#000000>
<p><h4><b>Winsock.dll</b></h4>
If you have several applications which use your modem (e.g. AOL or Trumpet 
Winsock), chances are very good that you will have more than one instance of 
<code>winsock.dll</code> on your hard drive.  If this is the case, it could 
cause problems when you try to connect to EnterAct.  If you find that it looks 
like you connect, but then cannot go to any web page, retrieve mail, or read 
news, it is possible that you have more than one of these files and they are 
conflicting.
<p>To solve this, do a find for <code>winsock.dll</code>.  You will probably 
have one in your <code>C:\WINDOWS</code> directory and in your 
<code>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\BACKUP</code> directory.  Any others should be 
renamed to <code>winsock.old</code>.
<p><h4><b>Are the DNS Addresses Correct?</b></h3>
DNS is a service that translates numeric Internet addresses
into easily-remembered hostnames ("enteract.com", for instance).
In order for this to work, your Internet software needs to know
the numeric address of EnterAct's domain name (DNS) servers.
<p>
If your DNS servers are specified incorrectly (or not at all),
you'll be unable to locate sites by their names, and will only
be able to talk to sites using their numeric addresses. If
one of your servers is right and any others are wrong, it will take
a long time to locate sites by their names. For the best
possible results, please make sure that you've set up your software
to use:
<p>
Primary: 207.229.143.1<br>
Secondary: 207.229.143.2
<p>If you are dialing a number on either the TCG or MFS lines, reverse the
order of the addresses above, so that 207.229.143.2 is the Primary DNS.
<p><h4><b>Duplicate TCP/IP Configurations</b></h4>
You may have unknowingly installed more than one TCP/IP in your network 
configuration.  This will more than likely prevent you from getting connected. 
Make sure to remove one of them and verify the settings for the remaining one.  
Keep in mind that it is OK if you have one TCP/IP linked up with your dial-up 
adapter and one linked up with your network card; you just can't have more 
than one linked up to the dial-up adapter.
<p><h4><b>Re-install Everything</b></h4>
If you've tried everything you can possibly think of, and the <a
href="win95set.html">settings</a> are all correct, try re-installing tcp/ip and 
dial-up adapter from the Network control panel.  Just remove them from the 
configuration and reboot.  Once you've restarted, reinstall them and try the 
whole thing again.
<p><h4><b>When All Else fails, Reboot</b></h4>
Rebooting not only will reset the modem, but may fix other anomalies with 
Win95.  Try it, it can't hurt.

<p><h3>Windows95 and Reported Connect Speeds</h3></a>
<P><font color=#000000> If you have a modem which supports 33.6kbps or
56.6kbps connects, you see that Windows will report your connect speeds as
either 28.8kbps or 115kbps. The cause for this is not having the most
recent .INF file installed for your modem. Without an INF file for the
modem which will recognize 33.6kbps or 56.6kbps, Windows will report any
connections over 28.8kbps as 115kbps.
<p>Contact your modem manufacturer or go to their web page to obtain a
copy of the most recent INF file for your modem. Uninstall your current
modem INF, add the new one, and restart.
