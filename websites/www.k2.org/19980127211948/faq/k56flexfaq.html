<p><b>A good starting point for any inquiry about the K56flex technology is the <a
href="http://www.k56flex.com" target="_top">K56flex home page</a>. Current news, FAQs, and
fixes are
availiable there.</b>

<p><h3>K56flex Connect Speed</h3>
<font color=black>
<p>K56Flex (and X2 for that matter) is NOT twice the speed of a 28.8 modem
or a 33.6 modem. Line noise, compatibility, and legal restrictions keep
your connect speed down below the 56k mark, regardless of what your modem
manufacturer claims. It has been our experience that K56Flex modems are
extremely sensitive to line noise. Most consumers report more frequent
disconnections, and an insignificant increase in download speeds. This is
something we expect to clear up with later code and firmware upgrades from
the modem manufacturers. This is still a budding technology, and it will
be a while before all the kinks are ironed out.

<p>Windows95 may not be reporting the true connect speed that you've
achieved with your modem. It's come to our attention that older Windows
drivers don't have the ability to report the connection speeds above 33.6.
It is EXTREMELY important, in this case, that you install the modem from
the driver disks that come with your new K56Flex modem. Do not just let
Windows detect your modem. New drivers and .inf files may be available
directly from Microsoft's page. We'll add a link if we find them.

<p><h3>Getting the Current Firmware</h3>
<font color=black>
It is strongly recommended that you go directly to your modem
manufacturer's web site to obtain the latest software image. Some of the most common
modem vendor's web sites are listed below. At the web site, be sure to look for or
search on K56flex flash updates. Make sure the flash is labeled version V1.0 or 
higher. Just because your modem is new, that does not necessarily mean that it
originally shipped with the current firmware release.

<p>A complete list of links to K56flex modem manufacturers' upgrade sites is avaliable 
<a href="http://www.k56flex.com/flexupgrade.html" target="_top">here</a>.

<p><h3>Init Strings</h3>
<font color=black>
<p>On your modem manufacturer's web page, keep an eye out for modem
initialization strings. There may well be optimized init strings that will
help you get the best possible connection with your modem. You may also
consider contacting your modem manufacturer directly, if they offer
technical support, as they may have this information at their fingertips.
We will try to compile a solid list of init strings as they become
available. 
<p>If you are using a <b>Zoom</b> K56flex modem and have v1.000 of the firmware or later,
try using the following string: <font color=#bb0000>AT S202=32</font>
<p> Other reccomended strings: <font color=#bb0000>AT&F1W2</font>,
<font color=#bb0000>AT&FW2S202=32</font>
</font>

<p><h3>Recommended Brands</h3>
<font color=black>
<p>All K56Flex modems do not seem to perform equally. We've seen the most
complaints about the Hayes Accura, so far. In an informal discussion, a
Rockwell representative at a major Internet convention this summer,
mentioned that he'd heard similar complaints from many Hayes users. He
recommended Diamond Supra, Motorola, Zoom, and Boca as the best modems so
far, in his opinion. In our experience with these manufacturers, we'd
recommend Diamond and Motorola above the other two.

<p><h3>Reporting Problems and Information</h3>
<font color=black>
<p>Again, we ask that any users that try out the service, and let us know
how it appears to be working -- or not working. We are especially
interested in any trouble reports. For these purposes we've set up a
mailbox at: <a href="mailto:flex@enteract.com">flex@enteract.com</a>, and
any general questions about the technology or future plans can and should
still be directed to the usual <a 
href="mailto:support@enteract.com">support@enteract.com</a>.
