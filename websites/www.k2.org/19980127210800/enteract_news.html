<p>We'd like to foster a community spirit here at EnterAct.  To help
with that goal, we have created some local newsgroups where people
can enter discussions, ask for help, give advice, or post announcements.

<p>Our support staff reads these newsgroups too, so if you have a
question for us that you feel might pertain to other members of
EnterAct, ask here, and the responses will be seen by all.

<p>You can read these newsgroups either through your web browser by
following the links below, or you can use your favorite newsreader to
access them.

<p>Please note that these newsgroups are local to the
news.enteract.com news server and so (unlike most other newsgroups,
which have global scope) will not appear on any other news server
besides news.enteract.com.  (In other words, if the newsgroups aren't
appearing, you probably have your web browser's news server configured
to be something other than news.enteract.com).

<p><em>Our newsgroups:</em>

<ul>
<li><a href = "news:enteract.completeact">enteract.completeact</a>
Discussions specific to <a href = "/complete.html">CompleteAct</a> accounts.
<br>

<br>

<p> You can find more information on USENET, including a USENET newsgroup
browser at the <a href = "http://sunsite.unc.edu/usenet-i/" target="_top">USENET
Info Center Launch Pad</a> (we carry many more newsgroups than are listed 
in their browser, but it is still a useful navigation tool).
