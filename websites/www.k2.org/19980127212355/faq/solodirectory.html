<p>
If you telnet or FTP into your account, you can view the directories and files that are set up
within your account.  In your root directory, you will notice three directories:
<p>
<font color=#bb0000>public_ftp </font> <br>
<font color=#bb0000>public_html </font><br>
<font color=#bb0000>web_logs</font>
<p>

<h3>public_ftp</h3>
<font color=#000000>
With the purchase of a SoloAct account, you are given an anonymous FTP area.  
Anonymous FTP allows you to make certain
files or programs available to anyone without them having to know
your password to obtain them.  Place any files you would like others
to have access to in the public_ftp directory.  In addition, you will 
need to make sure that the proper permissions are set so that your files
are world readable.  To do this, issue the following command at your UNIX prompt:
<p>
<font color=#bb0000>chmod a+r &lt;filename&gt;</font>
<p>

Once this is done, a person can then anonymously ftp to 
<font color=#bb0000>ftp.enteract.com</font> to obtain these files.
They should login using <font color=#bb0000>anonymous</font> as their username
and their e-mail address as their password.  To get to your files specifically, they should 
go to the /users/yourusername directory.


</font>
<h3>public_html</h3>
<font color=#000000>
This directory is where all of your html files go.  You should also put any
image or sound files that you use in your web page here.  If you call your main
page <font color=#bb0000>index.html</font> your URL will be <font color=#bb0000>
www.enteract.com/~yourusername</font>.  If you don't know how to 
<a href="http://www.enteract.com/faq/upload.html">upload your web pages</a>, please
click <a href="http://www.enteract.com/faq/upload.html">here</a>. 
</font>

<h3>web_logs</h3>
<font color=#000000>
Once you upload your web page and people start looking at it, you will see files appear every week
in your web_logs directory that look something like this:<p>
 <font color=#bb0000>access_log-3-13-97</font> and <font color=#bb0000>stats-3-13-97.html</font>.
<p>  
The access_log file will look something like this:
<p>
<font color=#bb0000>
167.142.12.148 - - [13/Mar/1997:03:05:13 -0600] "GET /THTMLS/tFormMail.html HTTP/1.0" 404 -<br>
206.127.6.13 - - [13/Mar/1997:04:25:17 -0600] "GET /ftp.html HTTP/1.0" 404 -<br>
205.212.124.152 - - [13/Mar/1997:08:45:22 -0600] "GET /ftp.html HTTP/1.0" 404 -<br>
194.73.232.29 - - [13/Mar/1997:09:06:44 -0600] "GET /start.html HTTP/1.0" 404 -
</font>
<p>
This file is a log of your web page hits.  Reading from left to right, it shows
the IP address of the machine that accesses your page, the date and time when your
page was accessed, and the file that was accessed from your site.
<p>
You are also given a corresponding file which is an HTML document.  It breaks down the logs
for you and gives you statistics about the hits you received.  To view these HTML 
documents, you will need to copy these HTML documents to your public_html directory and change
the permissions on them.  Issue the following commands at your UNIX prompt:<p>
<font color=#bb0000>
cd ~username/public_html<br>
mv ~username/web_logs/*.html .<br>
chmod a+r stats*.html</font>
<p>
At this point, you can view your statistics from your favorite web browser.  The URL
to see them will be <font color=#bb0000>http://www.enteract.com/~username/stats-mm-dd-yy.html</font>
Replace "mm-dd-yy" with the actual date of your file.  You are free to rename these files as well.
Issue the following command from your public_html directory:<p>
<font color=#bb0000>
mv &lt;old filename&gt; &lt;new filename&gt;
</font>
<p>
That's basically it, but you should realize that these web logs will be generated each and
every week, taking up space on the server.  Please remember to delete unnecessary or old
files with the <font color=#bb0000>rm &lt;filename&gt</font> command.
