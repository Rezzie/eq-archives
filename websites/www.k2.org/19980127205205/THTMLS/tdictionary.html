<FONT SIZE=+1>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Web Site</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   This is your page or pages on the World Wide Web. This is where most users
   will first locate your company's presence.
	</OL>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">FTP Site</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   Many companies wish to offer data files or program files that their
   customers can download and/or execute. An FTP Site gives the company the
   ability to offer these files.
   </OL>


<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Virtual E-mail</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   With 'Virtual E-mail' you can have 'anything@yourcompany.com' sent to a
   specific mailbox. Most sites offer easy contact points for their customers
   or prospective customers. For instance, on your web page you might have the
   line 'E-mail info@yourcompany.com for more information.' Customers could
   click here to very quickly request more information concerning your products
   or services. 'webmaster@yourcompany.com' is used for individuals who would
   like to make a suggestion concerning your website. These contact points are
   extremely important to individuals seeking information from your firm. We
   highly recommend them, regardless of where you host your site!
	</OL>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Auto-responder</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   A good way to make an impression with customers is to send them a quick
   response to their requests for information. An auto-responder is an
   automatic response sent by e-mail to anyone who sends a message to, for
   instance, 'info@yourcompany.com'. All customer queries are then sent on to
   individuals at your company for follow-up.
	</OL>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Mailing List</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   A mailing list is an easy way for customers of your company to discuss your
   product or service. Essentially, you set up an address called
   'yourproduct@yourcompany.com.' When a customer sends a message to this
   address, it will go to all of your customers who are 'subscribed' to the
   mailing list. Customers can easily subscribe and unsubscibe from the list.
   Most mailing lists involve active discussions among users, often with users
   helping other users solve problems!
	</OL>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Access Account</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   In order to administer a web page (i.e. get mail, redesign a web page, etc.)
   it is usually necessary to have a dial-up account. Of course this account,
   can also be used to check out the competition and to just have fun.
	</OL>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Statistics and Logging</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   What good is your site unless you can find out who's looking at it, how long
   their staying, and where they go. Basic usage reports are provided free and
   more complex usage reports can be generated for nominal fees.
	</OL

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">On-line Disk Storage</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   This refers to megabytes of disk storage available for HTML documents, FTP
   downloads, and auto-responder messages. For instance, a typical small
   company web-site might consist of one introduction page and 10-20 other
   information pages. If each page averaged 25K then this would use less than
   one megabyte of on-line storage. On the other hand, some large company sites
   might include a catalog with 1000 items and a 30K JPG image of each product.
   This would require closer to 30-40 megabytes of online storage.
	</OL>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Bandwidth</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   Bandwidth is a measure of how much data is being transmitted to a customer
   from your site. For instance, look at the example company above, where a
   page averaged 25K in size. To reach 1G of bandwidth, that company would need
   40,000 hits or accesses. You would need to have a pretty popular site or
   have a lot of graphics to exceed this!
	</OL>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Domain Name Registration</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   Many companies would like to register their corporate identity on the
   Internet. For instance, the discovery channel is found at www.discovery.com
   and the employees' addresses read jsmith@discovery.com.
	</OL>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Register Site with Major Indexes</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   In order for people to find your site, it is important that the major search
   indexes be aware of it. This is a remarkably easy process some
   providers charge PR firm rates to do. We'll gladly register your site in
   over 15 major indexes for only $60!
	</OL>
	
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Forms Support</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   Forms are used to collect information from your customers. The results of a
   form can then be e-mailed to you. For instance, your customers could fill
   out a form right on your web site requesting information about a specific
   product or service. This would generate an e-mail you could handle
   yourself or use an Auto-responder.
	</OL

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Database Capabilities</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   You can use our database capabilities to allow your customers to look up
   data from a database you own, or to input data into a database by using a
   form. For instance, say you wished to provide a service where customers
   could lookup a physician based on certain criteria. You would need database
   capabilities to hold the list of physicians and forms support to allow them
   to lookup data from the database. EnterAct's consultants can help you set
   all this up for an extra charge.
	</OL>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Custom CGI Scripts</FONT></STRONG>
	<OL>
   These can give your web site capabilities that really differentiate it. A
   CGI script allows you to execute programs on our server and return
   results to customers. For instance, many financial sites allow you to enter
   stock symbols to look up. These sites are using CGI scripts to lookup the
   data in a database and return the data in HTML form to you.
