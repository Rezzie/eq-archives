I've been busy with work lately (what, King of slackers busy with work??)
so I haven't had a chance to redo my home page.&nbsp; At any rate, my current
job no longer requires my to play around with HTML and Java so I no longer
need this as a sandbox to play in.&nbsp; I will eventually put something
in here, though.&nbsp; Perhaps I'll make it a New Year's resolution.&nbsp;
Anyway, you'd best hit the Back Arrow on your browser since there's not
much you can do from here.
