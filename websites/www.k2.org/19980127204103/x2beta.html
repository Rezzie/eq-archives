Due to popular demand we are currently testing equipment which
supports the U.S. Robotics X2 standard -- which allows users to
connect at higher speeds than 33.6K over normal telephone lines.  
To insure that this upgrade to service will be feasable, we are 
currently beta testing this equipment on a separate set of phone 
numbers to discover and attempt to resolve any issues that may come
along before fully implementing this on our system.  Since they
are still in testing, these numbers are subject to change and we 
cannot guarantee their reliability.<br><br>

We ask that any users that try out the service, and let us know how it 
appears to be working -- or not working.  We are especially interested
in any trouble reports.  For these purposes we've set up a special 
mailbox <a href="mailto:x2@enteract.com">x2@enteract.com</a>, 
any general questions about the technology or future plans should still 
be directed to the usual <a href="mailto:support@enteract.com">
support@enteract.com</a>.<br><br>


Without further ado, here are the X2 enabled numbers:<br><br>

These 21 phone lines are provided by Focal Communications, a company
which
assures us that these  lines provide complete band A coverage to the
Chicagoland region we are already covering with our other numbers.
Focal has also graciously provided us with a dialup locator to find
the number which is band A to you.  This may be found on our main <a href =
"/where.html#focal">dialup locations</a> page.  <em>If you use that
page, you will need to replace the last four digits of the number
Focal number reported with "3229" instead of "3228" to get the number
for the X2 pool</em>.  Focal guarantees the accuracy of reported band
A numbers in their dialup finder.  If Ameritech bills at a higher
rate, Focal will refund your money and work with Ameritech to fix the
problem!

<tr><th>Preventing Disconnects with X2</th></tr>
<tr><td>So far in our testing, a few customers have reported being
disconnected 3 to 5 minutes into an otherwise stable 50Kbps or higher
connection.If you are experiencing this problem, try increasing the value of the S10
register (found in the init string for your modem). It should be set to at
least 14 and maybe as high as 20. <br>
Also make sure that you are running the latest code. x2 is still a
protocol in the process of development. To make sure that you have the latest
code, go to <a href="http://totalservice.usr.com/upgrade/">USR's web site</a> 
and get their UPDATE WIZARD; this will inform you as
to what version you have and allow you to upgrade if necessary.
