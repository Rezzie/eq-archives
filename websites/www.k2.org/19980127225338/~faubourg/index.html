The Faubourg Ballet Threatre's mission statement is "A Dance Troupe With A Purpose".  The purpose of creating this dance company is two-fold; First, to bring the beauty and artistry of classical ballet to the people of the suburban Chicago area and beyond.  Second, to use the art of movement and discipline of dance to educate the members and associates of the troupe in positive moral and spiritual values, principles and ideas.  The philosophy of the Faubourg Ballet Theatre strongly encourages not only learning through teaching, but learning from doing.  A dancer's sense of self-respect and self-worth comes from the help they give or the joy they bring to others.  To that purpose, FBT intends to bring performances and exhibitions to schools, day care centers, senior citizen centers, and nursing homes.  Through this interaction, we hope that the troupe members will learn to serve as helpers and role models to younger children, and to understand and respect our seniors.  We would offer this as our contribution toward restoring the sense of repect and honor, and care that is so often lacking in our society today.<p>

Our intent is to raise $100,000 to support the educational and community service activities and to present our first production.  The inaugual production of Faubourg Ballet Threatre will be the American Premier of Avnun Yakubov's "Bambi" in October.  Mr. Yakuvov is Artistic Director alumnus of the Moscow Ballet. <He will stage the ballet with Mr. Watmora Casey, Director of the renowned Academy of Dance in Hanover Park, IL.<p></td></tr></table><p><br>
