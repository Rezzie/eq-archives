<H2><A NAME="A12">What is Blepharospasm?</A></H2>

Blepharospasm ['blef-a-ro-spaz-m] is a condition in which there is
sustained, forced, involuntary closing of the eyelids. It is both a cranial
and a focal dystonia.
Blepharo comes from the Greek word for eyelids. Cranial refers to the head
and focal indicates confinement to one part. The word dystonia describes
abnormal involuntary sustained muscles contractions and spasms.
Patients with blepharospasm have normal eyes. The visual disturbance is due
solely to the forced closure of the eyelids.<P> 
Blepharospasm should not be confused with:
<UL>
<LI> Ptosis - drooping of the eyelids caused by weakness or paralysis of a
levator muscle of the upper eyelid
<LI> Blepharitis - an inflammatory condition of the lids due to infection or
allergies
<LI>Hemifacial spasm - a non-dystonic condition involving various muscles on
one side of the face, often including the eyelid, and caused by irritation of
the facial nerve. The muscle contractions are more rapid and transient than
those of blepharospasm, and the condition is always confined to one side</UL><P>

<H2><A NAME="A5">How Does Blepharospasm Begin?</A></H2>

Blepharospasm usually begins gradually with excessive blinking and/or eye
irritation. In the early stages it may only occur with specific precipitating
stressors, such as bright lights, fatigue, and emotional tension.
As the condition progresses, it occurs frequently during the day. The spasms
disappear in sleep, and some people find that after a good night's sleep, the
spasms don't appear for several hours after waking.
Concentrating on a specific task may reduce the frequency of the spasms.
As the condition progresses, the spasms may intensify so that when they
occur, the patient is functionally blind; and the eyelids may remain
forcefully closed for several hours at a time.<P>

<H2><A NAME="A6">What Causes Blepharospasm?</A></H2>

Blepharospasm is thought to be due to abnormal functioning of the basal
ganglia which are situated at the base of the brain. The basal ganglia play a
role in all coordinated movements. 
We still do not know what goes wrong in the basal ganglia. It may be there is
a disturbance of various "messenger" chemicals involved in transmitting
information from one nerve cell to another. 
 In most people blepharospasm develops spontaneously with no known precipitating factor.  However, it has been observed that the signs and symptoms of <A HREF="blephar2.html#A1">dry eye</A> frequently precede and/or occur concomitantly with blepharospasm. <A NAME="A16"> It</A> has been suggested that dry eye may trigger the onset of blepharospasm in susceptible persons <A HREF="blephar2.html#A2">(Elston 1994)</A>.
Infrequently, it may be a familial disease with more than one family member
affected.
Blepharospasm can occur with dystonia affecting the mouth and/or jaw
(oromandibular dystonia, Meige syndrome). In such cases, spasms of the
eyelids are accompanied by jaw clenching or mouth opening, grimacing, and
tongue protrusion.
Blepharospasm can be induced by drugs, such as those used to treat
Parkinson's disease. When it is due to antiparkinsonian drugs, reducing the
dose alleviates the problem.<P>

<H2>What are the Current Forms of Therapy?</H2>

<H3><A NAME="A7">Botulinum Toxin Injections</A></H3>
Botulinum toxin is an approved treatment for blepharospasm and hemifacial
spasm in the United States and Canada. This is a toxin produced by the
bacteria Clostridium botulinum. It weakens the muscles by blocking nerve
impulses transmitted from the nerve endings of the muscles.
When it is used to treat blepharospasm, minute doses of botulinum toxin are
injected intramuscularly into several sites above and below the eyes. The
sites of the injection will vary slightly from patient to patient and
according to physician preference. They are usually given on the eyelid, the
brow, and the muscles under the lower lid. The injections are carried out
with a very fine needle. Benefits begin in 1 - 14 days after the treatment
and last for an average of three to four months. Long-term follow-up studies
have shown it to be a very safe and effective treatment, with up to 90
percent of patients obtaining almost complete relief of their blepharospasm.
Side effects include drooping of the eyelid (ptosis), blurred vision, and double vision (diplopia). 
Tearing may occur. All are transient and recover spontaneously.
Providing the dose is kept small and the injections carried out at a minimum
of three-month intervals, repeated treatments remain effective over a long
period of time.<P>

Recent research suggests that injection of botulinum immune globulin in conjunction with botulinum toxin injections may reduce the incidence of ptosis (<A HREF="http://www.ski.org/ABScott_lab/">Abstract</A>).<P> 

<H3><A NAME="A8">Medical (Drug) Treatment</A></H3> 
Drug therapy for blepharospasm is difficult. Medications have different
mechanisms of action and generally produce unpredictable and short-lasting
benefits. One drug may work for some patients and not for others. When the
effects of one drug wear off, sometimes the replacement with another drug
helps. There is, therefore, no fixed or best regimen. Establishing a
satisfactory treatment scheme requires patience on the part of both the
physician and the patient. 
The following drugs may be tried:
Artane (trihexyphenidyl), Cogentin (benztropine), Valium (diazepam), Klonapin
(clonazpam), Lioresal (baclofen), Tegretol (carbamazepine), Sinemet or
Modopar (levodopa), Parlodel (bromocriptime), and Symmetrel (amantadine).
This list is by no means complete, and there are many more new drugs being
developed. The use of these medications requires close supervision from a
neurologist, and it is important that the patient does not change the dosage
or stop the medications without consulting his/her neurologist.<P>

<H3><A NAME="A9">Surgery</A></H3>
Before surgery is recommended, patients are advised to try safe, potentially efficacious, nonsurgical therapy such as botulinum toxin injections.  Functionally impaired patients with blepharospasm who have not tolerated or responded well to medication or botulinum toxin are candidates for surgical therapy.  At present, protractor myectomy (removal of some or all of the muscles responsible for eyelid closure ) has proven to be the most effective surgical treatment for blepharospasm.  Current experience has found that myectomy has improved visual disability in 75-80% of cases of blepharospasm.<P>


<H3><A NAME="A10">Supportive Forms of Treatment</A></H3>
Stress makes all movement disorders, including blepharospasm, worse. Some
patients may benefit from a course of stress management from an occupational
therapist.
Patients learn their own coping techniques which they share with others at
support group meetings.
Dark glasses are the commonest aid. They fulfill two functions. They reduce
the intensity of sunlight which bothers many people with blepharospasm, and
they hide the eyes from curious onlookers.
Unless the patient is receiving treatment that is effective, he/she is at
risk for becoming socially isolated. This fear of sustained spasms occurring
while driving, crossing the road, socializing, walking, or taking part in
some sporting activity, etc. becomes overwhelming, and the patient stays at
home in familiar, safe surroundings.
Support from family and friends is important. Thousands of persons are
experiencing the same symptoms.  The<A REF="#A1"> Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research Foundation</A> has support groups throughout the U.S. and one in Canada.  Sharing experiences at support group
meetings will reassure a patient and his/her family. Up-to-date treatments and medical advances are also presented at <A HREF="blepharm.html#A1">support group meetings and an annual conference</A>. The<A  REF="http://www.dystonia-foundation.org/dmrf.html"> Dystonia Medical Research Foundation</A> has
<A HREF="http://www.dystonia-foundation.org/~dystonia/contact0.html">support groups</A> throughout the U.S and Canada for persons with all types of dystonia - not just blepharospasm.<P>
