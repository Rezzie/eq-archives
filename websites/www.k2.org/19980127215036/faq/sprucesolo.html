<h1>How do I improve the look of my web page listing?</h1>

<h3>Ever wondered how people get those cute little icons and descriptions
listed with their user names?</h3>
</center>


<ol>

<p><li>Getting a little picture to pop up.
<p>Go find a .gif image that you wish to use as an icon somewhere and place 
it in your <samp>public_html</samp> directory with the filename 
<samp>icon.gif</samp>. <b>Note:</b> This .gif image may not be larger than
100 X 100 pixels.  If your image is larger, it will not show up.  Resize
it and try again.

<p><li>Getting a description listed by your entry.
<p>Place a file in your <samp>public_html</samp> directory called 
<samp>.info</samp>. This file should look something like;

<code>
<p>&lt;name&gt;
The World's Greatest Home Page!
&lt;/name&gt;
<br>&lt;description&gt;
This is my cool home page. Check it out!
&lt;/description&gt;
</code>

<p>Note that it is important to have that &lt;description&gt; tag in there.

<p>If you wanted to keep your homepage from being listed, simply place a 
&lt;private&gt; in your public_html/.info file and your page will be kept a 
secret.

</ol>

<br>It should be as simple as that. Just go back to where you would 
normally find your entry and make sure everything looks right. Remember, it can
take up to 60 minutes for the listings page to update with your new
information, so if you don't see your changes at first, don't worry. If you
have difficulty, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us for 
help</a>.
