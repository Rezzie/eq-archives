Can you imagine...youwalk into your office one day and suddenly you realize your computer ismissing. Can you easily replace the hardware? Can you easily reconstructthe data? Are you concerned about the stolen data now in the hands of others?What about those deleted files that really still do exist on the hard drive.Usually only the file name is deleted from the directory and someone witha utility program can find info that you don't want him to have. <BR><BR>Did you know that computer theft is second only to automobile theft? Thereare about $10 Billion worth of computers stolen annually. Many computersdisappear when the building security system is turned off during daytimehours. Until recently there was not much you could do about this problem,then LineSense was invented. <BR></P><H4>Born out of necessity</H4><P>LineSense was developed to combat the high theft rate of office and laboratoryequipment such as computers, electronic balances, fax machines etc. Duringtheft they are all disconnected from the AC power, so this was the commonlink that we investigated and subsequently invented and patented LineSense.</P><H4>What is LineSense?</H4><P>LineSense is a high tech anti-theft electronic security sensor incorporatinga sense lead, e-field detector, amplifier, power supply, signal processorand rf transmitter with several built in tamper detect circuits for cutwires, cover removal and sensor pry off. The transmitter is crystal controlledfor maximum stability and range. Each LineSense regularly transmits a supervisorysignal to insure system integrity. <BR><BR>LineSense detects a weak e-field that is present near the outer layer ofa common three wire, 110 VAC power cord, through its sense lead which iswrapped around the cord. This field is present while the cord is pluggedinto a live outlet even if the computer is turned off. At the first signof theft or tampering, LineSense transmits a digitally encoded radio frequencysignal to an ITI receiver for on premise security officers to respond.</P><H4>Proven Product</H4><P>Our units in the field have been working great now for over six years.There is nothing else that works like LineSense. End users report that theyare now able to eliminate theft as well as provide more accurate and timelyinventory control since using LineSense. Prior to LineSense some theftsweren't noticed for months until an inventory was taken. Users of electronicbalances for example would simply take another one from somewhere else inthe facility if theirs was missing and so on.</P><H3><FONT SIZE=+2>System Components:</FONT></H3><H4>SX-V Special CPU /Receiver</H4><P>Monitors up to 99 LineSense units each and displays the unit ID number.</P><H4>Keypad /Annunciator</H4><P>Allows authorized personnel to enter access code and bypass any sensorand to view the status of an SX-V Special CPU.</P><H4>CS-4000 Central Station Receiver</H4><P>Receives calls dialed over normal telephone lines from SX-V's to remotelymonitor alarms, remote control program and printout activity.</P><H5><HR ALIGN=LEFT><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><FONT SIZE=+2>Installation</FONT></H5><P>LineSense is now supplied with very high bond adhesive foam. Just peelprotective strip from base of LineSense and press into place. Programmingis identical and it transmits supervisory, tamper, alarm, and restore signals.The professional alarm installer should be familiar with the programmingand operation of the ITI system.</P><H3><A NAME="learnmode"></A>New Learn Mode Sensors</H3><P>The ITI learn mode transmitters are made with a unique code built in.There is no house code or sensor code to contend with and it does not requireprogramming of the transmitter. It is only necessary to tell the controlpanel what sensor group you want next and then the sensor number and thenyou trip the tamper on the sensor. The control panel then stores this info.The memory is retained even if the battery dies after about six years. Thesense lead and ground wires are the reverse of the non learnmode type. Thenew model SX-V Special control panel can accept up to 99 learn mode transmitters.<HR ALIGN=LEFTSIZE="3"><B><FONT SIZE=+1>LineSense</FONT></B> is a patented product ofG-B ELECTRONICS of Addison, IL.

Primarily Ademco and ITIsupervised wireless equipment is used. Communication with the central stationmonitor now gives detailed point identification to direct police to theexact door or window. Now you can call your alarm system from a TouchTonephone anywhere and with your personal code, arm or disarm, turn on a lightor set back the thermostat. It even speaks to you and lets you know justwhat's going on. Every phone in your home can be a keypad.</P><H3><A NAME="cctv"></A>CCTV Closed Circuit Television</H3><P>There are now so many applications for cctv in security and process control.Covert cameras are built into clocks, thermostats, radios, mirrors, picturesand more... They have the ability to see without visible light. A singleVCR can store the information from multiple cameras. The video can be viewedwith appropriate equipment from remote location over a normal dial up telephoneline as well as remote control of the camera pan, tilt and zoom. Gates canthen be unlocked, doors opened, deliveries logged etc.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3><A NAME="monitoring"></A>Central Station Monitoring</H3><P>Central station monitoring is key to a professional alarm system. Thereneeds to be someone to get the police or fire dispatched efficiently. Youjust can't count on a neighbor responding to a siren or bell that he hears.He might not be there at the time you need him. Professional UL approvedcentral stations such as Emergency 24 keep detailed records, respond ina timely manner and really make the system work. They are there for yoursafety during weekends and holidays. They are there during vacation.
