<P><h3><b>Remove Multiple PPP Drivers</b></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>When you open MacTCP, you should notice a few icons listed such as PPP
and/or LocalTalk.  
<p>

<p>
PPP and only PPP should be highlighted.  If you see
SLIP highlighted in addition to PPP, you will need to remove SLIP from
your extensions folder.  Also, if you have AOL installed on your Mac and
you see AOL's driver listed amongst the icons shown in MacTCP, you will
want to remove that from your extensions folder as well.  Do this even if
AOL is not highlighted.  Installing AOL has been known to wipe out MacTCP
settings.

<P><h3><b>That Pesky MacTCP is Acting Up Again</b></h3>
<font color=#000000>
Do you get this message when opening up an Internet Application
like Netscape?  If so, it could be as a result of several things.
Check for the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>Are the PPP extension and ConfigPPP control panel installed?  Make sure
that PPP is in your extensions folder (located in your system folder)
and that you have the ConfigPPP control panel.    
<li>Are you actually dialed up to EnterAct and connected?  If not,
go to your ConfigPPP and open a connection.
<li>Are you letting your internet application dial for you?  If so,
try dialing through your ConfigPPP as opposed to letting
your internet application bring up your dialer. 
<li>Is MacTCP or TCP/IP configured correctly?  Check out the setup pages
for <a href="http://www.enteract.com/faq/mactcp.html">MacTCP</a> or
<a href="http://www.enteract.com/faq/tcpip.html">TCP/IP</a> to make sure.
<li>The MacTCP or TCP/IP files may be corrupt.
If you are using <font color=#bb0000>MacTCP</font>, throw the MacTCP control panel,
MacTCP DNR, and MacTCP Prep files into the trash. Reinstall MacTCP 
with a custom installation from the Mac OS 7.5 installer, or drag-copy 
from previous system versions. You will have to enter all necessary 
information in the control panel.
<p>
If you are using <font color=#bb0000>TCP/IP</font>, throw the
TCP/IP control panel and TCP/IP Preference files into the trash.
Reinstall the TCP/IP control panel with a custom installation
from the Mac OS 7.5.2 or higher installer. Once you are at the Custom Install
choices, extend Networking, extend Open Transport, and choose
TCP/IP. You will have to enter all necessary information in the control panel.
