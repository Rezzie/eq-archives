<h1>Mailing Lists for subscribers</h1><p>

Academic Computing Services, University of Chicago<p>

Our mailing lists are managed by individual "list administrators"
assisted by a program called majordomo. This program distributes the
e-mail sent to the mailing list, handles much of the routine
subscribing to and unsubscribing from the list, and answers basic
information requests about the list.<p>

In order to <A HREF="#subscribe">subscribe</A> to one of our mailing
lists, first find out its name (see the "<A HREF="#lists">lists</A>"
command below). Then send mail to
<b>majordomo@listhost.uchicago.edu</b>. The subject doesn't matter,
but the text should say <b>subscribe <tt>listname</tt></b>,
substituting the name of the list for <b><tt>listname</tt></b>, e.g.
<b>subscribe testing-list</b>.  Similarly, if later you want to <A
HREF="#unsubscribe">unsubscribe</A> to the list, send mail saying
<b>unsubscribe <tt>listname</tt> </b>to
<b>majordomo@listhost.uchicago.edu</b>, again substituting the name of
the list for <b><tt>listname</tt></b>.  Continue to substitute the
name of the list wherever you see <b><tt>listname</tt></b> later in
the document; substitute the appropriate email address wherever you
see <b><tt>address</tt></b>.<p>

In order to send mail to be distributed through the mailing list,
simply send the mail you want to be distributed to
<b><tt>listname</tt>@listhost.uchicago.edu</b>. Mail sent to that
address will automatically be picked up by a program called majordomo
and redistributed to the list of subscribers majordomo has.<p>

There are a number of other commands that you can give majordomo. It
is important that all commands to majordomo be phrased and spelled
exactly the way they are given here. Because majordomo is a computer
program, it is very literal-minded and can only understand commands
which exactly match the ones it was taught.<p>

Here's a list of the things you can tell majordomo to do. You send it
these commands by sending mail to
<b>majordomo@listhost.uchicago.edu</b>, leaving the subject line
blank, and including each command as a separate line of text.<p>

<dl>

<dt>The email message says:

<dd>What majordomo does when it receives the command.  (Go to example,
if applicable)

<dt><b>help</b>

<dd>Majordomo replies with a list of commands

<dt><b><A NAME="subscribe">subscribe</A> <tt>listname</tt></b>

<dd>Majordomo subscribes the sender to the named list. (<A
HREF="#subscribeex">Example</A>)

<dt><b>subscribe <tt>listname address</tt></b>

<dd>Majordomo subscribes the address given to the named list.

<dt><b><A NAME="unsubscribe">unsubscribe</A> <tt>listname</tt></b>

<dd>Majordomo unsubscribes the sender from the named list
<emp>if</emp> the sender sent the mail from exactly the address he was
subscribed to. (<A HREF="#unsubscribeex">Example</A>)

<dt><b>unsubscribe <tt>listname address</tt></b>

<dd>Majordomo unsubscribes the address from the named list.

<dt><b>which</b>

<dd>Majordomo sends back a reply including a catalogue of the mailing
lists the sender is subscribed to at the <tt>address</tt> he sent the
mail from.

<dt><b>which <tt>address</tt></b>

<dd>Majordomo sends back a reply including a list of the mailing lists
the address given is subscribed to.

<dt><b><A NAME="lists">lists</A></b>

<dd>Majordomo sends back a reply including a catalogue of the mailing
lists which majordomo handles, with a half-line description of each
list.  (<A HREF="#listsex>Example</A>)

<dt><b>info <tt>listname</tt></b>

<dd>Majordomo sends back the summary information about the list that
the list owner may have provided.  (<A HREF="#infoex">Example</A>)

<dt><b>who <tt>listname</tt></b>

<dd>Majordomo replies with a roster of the e-mail addresses which are
subscribed to the named list.

<dt><b>index <tt>listname</tt></b>

<dd>Majordomo replies with an index of the filenames for the archive
of the named list.

<dt><b>get <tt>listname filename</tt></b>

<dd>Majordomo sends the specific filename requested.

<dt><b>end</b>

<dd>Majordomo ignores anything in a letter which comes after the
command "end" instead of trying to treat it as a command.  If you have
a signature or other text at the end of your letter use end as the
last command.  </dl><p>

<p>

Not all of these commands are necessarily usable for any given list;
the administrator for that list can turn these commands off. The
command which most often gets turned off is "subscribe;" the list
owner can tell majordomo to require a password before letting people
get subscribed to the list -- in which case a subscribe command is
forwarded to the list owner (administrator).  Similarly, majordomo can
be told not to give out information about the list without the owner's
password, or not to resend the mail sent to
<b><tt>listname</tt>@listhost.uchicago.edu</b> to the subscribers
without the owner's approval. If majordomo can understand a request
but has been told not to obey it without a password, majordomo will
forward the request to the list owner; the owner can then approve or
deny the request.<p>

Sometimes list subscribers may need to reach a person instead of the
majordomo program. The majordomo program will automatically forward
mail that needs password approval to the list owner. However, if you
need to contact your list owner directly, you can send mail to the
owner of a list by sending mail to
<b>owner-<tt>listname</tt>@listhost.uchicago.edu</b>.<p>
