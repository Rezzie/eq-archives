&nbsp;Welcome to Katman's Home Page <IMG SRC="flame.gif">

<P>
Hi! Thanks for stopping by... I last updated this site on September 23, 1997.
<P>
NOTE: This page is under major construction and serves as my first attempt
at hand coded html.

I plan to use this page mostly to talk about amateur robotics. 
&nbsp;I've provided a <A href="rollcall.htm">link</A>, so you can
see pictures of some other machines I find interesting.
&nbsp; Below is a picture of a robot tiny that can be expanded by adding more layers.

To pay for my robotics, I work as a FAA systems designer, specializing
in navigational aids.
