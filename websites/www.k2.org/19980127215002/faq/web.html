<h1>Setting up a web page in 15 minutes</h1>
</center>
<hr width=55%>
 <BR><BR> It's real
simple.  If you're using netscape (all browsers generally have some
similar function), you should have the choice to "<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">View</FONT>", under which you should find "<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">View Document Source</FONT>".  Go to a page that looks
the way you really want it.  Now "View the Document Source."<BR>

<BR>

Now select all the text, and copy it.  Paste it into your favorite
text editor.  Now you'll see a lot of junk you don't understand.  The
concept is this: when you make text bold, there are some invisible
characters that tell the word processing program to make that word
bold.  They might look like this:<BR>

<BR>

<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF00000">&lt;BOLD&GT;<STRONG>I'm happnin'</STRONG>&LT;/BOLD&GT;</FONT></CENTER><BR>

<BR>

These are called 'Tags', and they indicate how the browser should
interpret the text that it finds between the opening tag
(&lt;BOLD&GT;) and the closing tag (&LT;/BOLD&GT;).  This language is
called HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language).<BR>

<BR>

If you go to this site: <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/html3/Contents.html">
http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/html3/Contents.html</A>,
you will see an on-line reference for the current version of HTML,
3.0.  This changes about every 6 months, and browsers like Netscape
use some special, proprietary codes.  If you see Tags not explained in
the above site, they're probably particular to a specific browser.<BR>

<BR>

Anyway, the on-line reference explains what the tags mean.  If you
can't understand all this, any you really want to know, go blow forty
bucks on "Teach yourself HTML in 21 days."  If you're still lost, now
you know why people are getting such big bucks for this stuff.<BR>

<BR>

Now, change that page you just stole to fit your own whims.  Put in
your very own text and images.  Place them in tables.  Make them funny
colors.  You get the idea.  Now, save this by exporting it as a text
file, or using "Save As" and Choosing "text" as the file type.<BR>

<BR>

Now you need some program (see <A HREF="products.html">internet
software</A>) that will allow you to "upload" your text file to
EnterAct's server.  For the mac, use Fetch 3.0.x.  For the IBM, use
WSFTP or CUTEFTP.  To learn how to FTP we have a <a
href="ftp.html">slide show</a> for you.

<BR>
<BR>
Now, in your browser, type in the URL (Uniform Resource Locator).  An example might look like:<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>
	<FONT COLOR="#809088">http://www.enteract.com/~yourusername/thefile.html</FONT><BR>
</CENTER>

<BR>

By default, all html files should end in ".html" - GOT IT?<BR>

<BR><BR>

That's all there is to it.<BR><BR>

through the whole process.<BR> <BR>
