<h1>Welcome to the CSA Group</h1>

<body>
Within the past several years, hospitals, universities, 
and other service-based businesses have spent millions of dollars 
strengthening customer relations in an effort to 
distinguish themselves. Most realize that 
offering first-rate service is one of the best ways 
to attract and keep customers in an increasingly 
competitive arena; many, however, have no plan in 
place to evaluate their service programs from the 
only vantage that really matters: the customer's perspective.

<h2>How We Can Help You</h2>

The CSA Group conducts communication audits to evaluate 
the level of telephone service your organization provides. 
We initiate anonymous calls to your service centers that 
simulate realistic customer situations, thoroughly documenting 
each encounter. In the end, we provide you with both 
quantitative and qualitative evaluations that will assess how 
well your customers are being served.
<p>
Our team of associates conducts each call using survey 
materials tailored specifically to your organization’s service 
needs. We offer audit packages that evaluate the basic 
components of your service structure, including how 
representatives handle each call and whether they are 
knowledgeable enough to help customers consistently find 
what they need. We also offer more focused audits that can 
help you track certain areas or evaluate the success of 
service initiatives.
<p>
The CSA group also offers follow-up audits for those 
interested in monitoring progress throughout the 
course of several months or even years. And, for those 
who wish to complement an assessment with related training, 
our staff can prepare and conduct developmental seminars 
to strengthen communication skills or highlight techniques 
for better integrating technology and service.
<p>

<h2>Why You Should Choose CSA</h2>
The CSA Group is comprised of communication management 
professionals with over 15 years of experience in 
service-based industries. All our associates are trained in 
telemarketing with a special focus on both phone etiquette 
and call center technology. And, perhaps most important, 
we offer real-life experience as service consumers.
<p>
