	<P>ConfigPPP should bring up a window with a bar in it, and complete the following steps while
	slowly filling in the bar with gray:
	<OL>
		<P><LI>Looking for modem...
		<LI>Initializing modem...
		<LI>Dialing Enteract...
		<LI>Logging on...
		<LI>Log on successful...
		<LI>Successful
	</OL>

	<P>If you receive a "PPP timed out...." error during any one of these steps,
	try increasing the time in the various
	<A HREF="config.html">ConfigPPP</A> settings.
	
	
	<P>If you've tried all this and you're still not getting through, let's check the
	obvious (you'd be surprised...):

	<OL>

		<P><LI>Your modem is actually plugged into the modem port

		<LI>your phone line is correctly plugged into your modem

		<LI>your modem is on

		<P>You can generally tell this is all Ok if when you try to dial, you see 
		your modem lights flicker.

	</OL>
	

	<P>If you're getting an error message (type -39 for instance), or if you've
	tried absolutely everything else, we go to plan B.
	
	<P>Sometimes, particularly when your Macintosh was configured to connect with another
	ISP, or with different software, or if you've upgraded your system, the system gets
	confused between remnants of old networking software, and you need to purge.

	<P>If you're specifically running Open Transport, make sure that "MacTCP Prep" DOES NOT appear
	in your system folder.  If it does, throw it out, empty your trash and reboot.
	
	<P>More generally, throwing away all your networking preferences (and emptying your trash),
	then reconfiguring MacTCP and/or ConfigPPP and/or TCP/IP will often solve the most persnickety
	problems.  It's helpful to go through and write down all the settings FIRST.  Then look in your
	"Preferences" folder (in your system folder) for anything that contains the letters "TCP" and drag
	those items into the trash.  Repeat for the letters "PPP."
	
	<P>If that doesn't work, for a really fun time, delete ALL your networking software (MAKE SURE
	you have the original diskettes or CD's first so you can re-install it):

	<OL>

		<P><LI><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#a22010">Make sure</FONT></STRONG> you have all your network
		software (ConfigPPP stuff and MacTCP stuff) backed up on a diskette.

		<LI>Do a find (Command-F) for  "PPP" on your hard drive, and drag 
		all the items you find into the trash.

		<LI>Repeat for "TCP".

		<LI>Empty the trash.

		<LI><A HREF="install.html">Reinstall</A> the software.

		<LI>Re-configure and try again.

	</OL>
