<H4>Well, what did you expect to find here?  A lame bio about myself ... as if you really care about me and my life?  Some stupid pictures of me and other people ... who you really don't give a shit about?  Some "cool links" ... as if you don't know how to surf the web already?  A lame guestbook ... so you can see what other lamers (besides yourself) have been here?  Homepage credits ... as if i needed anyone's help to create this lame-ass homepage?  No ... this is all you're gonna find here.
