<font color=#000000>
<p>If you have several applications which use your modem (e.g. AOL or
Trumpet Winsock), chances are very good that you will have more than one
instance of <font color=#bb0000><code>winsock.dll</code></font> on your
hard drive. If this is the case, it could cause problems for you 
when trying to connect to EnterAct.  If you find that it looks like you connect, but then cannot go to any web page, retrieve mail, or read news, it is possible that you have more than one of these files and they are conflicting.
<p>To solve this, do a search for <font
color=#bb0000><code>winsock.dll</code></font> from your file
manager or from within DOS with the <font color=#bb0000><code>C:\>dir /s
winsock.dll</code></font>
command.  You should have one <font
color=#bb0000><code>winsock.dll</code></font>
file in your Chameleon or Windows directory.  
Any others should be renamed to <font
color=#bb0000><code>winsock.old</code></font>.
</font>
<p><a name=dnsleon><h3>Are the DNS Addresses Correct?</h3><a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>
DNS is a service that translates numeric Internet addresses
into easily-remembered hostnames ("enteract.com", for instance).
In order for this to work, your Internet software needs to know
the numeric address of EnterAct's domain name (DNS) servers.
<p>
If your DNS servers are specified incorrectly (or not at all),
you'll be unable to locate sites by their names, and will only
be able to talk to sites using their numeric addresses. If
one of your servers is right and any others are wrong, it will take
a long time to locate sites by their names. For the best
possible results, please make sure that you've set up your software
to use:
<p>
Primary: 207.229.143.1<br>
Secondary: 207.229.143.2
</font>
<p><a name=baudleon><h3>Baud Rate</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Try lowering your baud rate.  With some modems, if your baud rate is
too high, you may not connect well, or even at all.  If you have a 28,800
modem, try setting your baud rate to <font color=#bb0000>57,600</font> 
bps. And if you have a 14,400
modem, try setting it to <font color=#bb0000>38,400</font>.  You can
always try raising it up to
115,200 for 28.8 modems or 57,600 for 14,400 modems to see if you can
achieve faster speeds.
