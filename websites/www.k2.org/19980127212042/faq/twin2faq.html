<p><h3><a name=dll>Winsock.dll</a></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>If a you have several applications which use your modem (e.g. AOL or Trumpet Winsock), chances are very good that you will have more than one instance of <code><font color=#bb0000>winsock.dll</font></code> on your hard drive.  If this is the case, it 
could cause problems for you when you try to connect to EnterAct.  If you
find that it looks like you are connected, but then you are unable go to any web page, retrieve mail, or read news, it is possible that you have more than one of these files and they are conflicting.
<p>To solve this, do a search for <font color=#bb0000><code>winsock.dll</code></font> from your file manager or from within DOS with the <font color=#bb0000><code>C:\>dir /s winsock.dll</code></font> command.  You should have one in your Trumpet Winsock 
directory.  Any others should be renamed to <code><font color=#bb0000>winsock.old</font></code>
</font>
<p><h3><a name=manlog>Manual Login</a></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Most often when using Trumpet, login problems are a result of trying to log in automatically. Earlier versions of Trumpet do not include a usable <font color=#bb0000><code>login.cmd</code></font> for EnterAct.  We do have a custom <font color=#bb0000>
<code>login.cmd</code></font> at our public ftp site (
<font color=#bb0000>ftp.enteract.com</font>), but we haven't found that
replacing it fixes login problems.  Our recommendation for Trumpet 2.x users is to either download Trumpet 3.0, which is very easy to login automatically with, or to dial in manually.  You simply need to go to the dialer pull down menu and choose manual l

ogin.  After you dial, you will be prompted for their username and password.  After entering those, you will
see garbage stream across your screen.  Hit your Esc key to finish your PPP connection.
</font>
<p><h3><a name=netgate>Netmask &amp; Gateway</a></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>These two values must be set correctly (<font color=#bb0000>255.255.255.0</font> for <font color=#bb0000>Netmask</font> and <font color=#bb0000>0.0.0.0</font> for <font color=#bb0000>Gateway</font>) in order for Trumpet to connect to us properly.  In o

rder to change these values, you will have to deselect the <font color=#bb0000>Internal PPP</font> check box.  When you've changed the appropriate values, check <font color=#bb0000>Internal PPP</font> again.
</font>
<p><h3><a name=mssmtu>MSS and MTU</a></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>These values should initially be set at <font color=#bb0000>1024</font> and <font color=#bb0000>1500</font>.  If you have problems with slow connects, try lowering the <font color=#bb0000>MTU</font> to <font color=#bb0000>576</font>.  It may help.
</font>
<p><h3><a name=comport>Comm Port</a></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>If your modem does not respond at all, or if when manually dialing nothing you type appears, check the com port (it will be called <font color=#bb0000>slip port</font> in Trumpet).  Make sure it is set correctly.  If you don't know which port is the 
correct one, keep trying different ports until you get the right one.
</font>
<p><h3><a name=baudinit>Baud Rates, Init Strings, and Comm Overrun Errors</a></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Many times you will get com overruns with Trumpet Winsock.  There are a few things that can fix this.  1) Make sure <font color=#bb0000>MSS</font> is set to <font color=#bb0000>1024</font>.  2) Make sure that the baud rate is not set too high 
(no higher than <font color=#bb0000>57,600</font> for 28.8 modems and no higher than <font color=#bb0000>38,400</font> for 14.4). 3) Make the init string <font color=#bb0000>ATZ</font>.  I've noticed that some people who are using <font color=#bb0000>AT&F

1</font> 
in Trumpet are getting comm overruns.  When they change it, the error messages go away.
</font>
<p><h3><a name=logpap>Login Woes and PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)</a></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>This should not be selected for Manual logins.  It can be found under <font color=#bb0000>File/PPP Options</font> and you will not authenticate if it is selected.  Also verify that the username and password are being typed in correctly (logins are 
lowercase and passwords are case sensitive).</p>
</font>
<p><h3><a name=phonenumb>Try Different Phone Numbers</a></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>A good thing to try if things don't seem to be working right (you aren't authenticating, or you get an IP address but can't ping) is to try a different phone number on a different system.  This will often fix the problem.
</font>
<p><h3><a name=iaef>If All Else Fails...</a></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Exit trumpet, restart Windows, and try again.  Can't hurt, can it?
