That's a picture <A HREF="http://www.dannyland.org/~cingirl/">my daughter
</A>of and me (naturally, I'm much better looking in person...)
<BR>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.uiuc.edu/ph/www/djhoward/">My son</A> also
has a web page.
<BR>About me: I am a 40-something single mother,<A HREF="http://www.apta.org/">
physical therapist,</A> manager of a Rehab department in a community teaching
hospital, and I love crafts, currently counted cross-stitch and quilting.&nbsp;
I belong to a <A HREF="http://www.phase3.com/~laura">fabric exchange group</A>.&nbsp;
If quilting is your thing (or you have an insatiable desire for more fabric),
consider joining.
