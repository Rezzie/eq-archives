<P><h3><b>My Modem is Not Listed in the Modems Control Panel</b></h3>
<p><font color=#000000> Ideally, you should obtain a modem script from
your modem vendor and place it in the Modem Scripts folder (System
Folder:Extensions:Modem Scripts). The scrollable list of modems in OT/PPP
corresponds to the scripts in this location.
<P>You Also can modify an existing Modem Script. This is really for advanced users. If you want to try modifying an existing Modem Script <A HREF="modemscript.html">Click Here</A>.
<P>You Can Create your own Modem Script for your modem. This is also for Advanced users but most users can do it with their modem's manual in hand. <A HREF="makingmodemscript.html">Click here</A>. Also Contains a links to all the applications you need.
<p>If you are unable to obtain a script from you modem vendor, and don't want to try any of the other options, you can  
request a recommended initialization string to use with PPP connections,
or you can use a simple string such as ATZ or AT&F1. This will also get you on line so you can at least go to your modems webpage to get a new script. With that
initialization string in hand you can use the following workaround:
<p>
<ol> 
<li>Select <font color=#bb0000>Null Modem 57600</font> in the Modem window
of the PPP control panel and close the window. 
<li>Select <font color=#bb0000>Options</font> at the bottom of the PPP
control panel.
<li>Select the <font color=#bb0000>Protocol</font> tab.
<li>Place an "X" beside <font color=#bb0000>Connect to a command line
host</font> and beside <font color=#bb0000>Use terminal window</font> and
close this window.
<li>Click <font color=#bb0000>Connect</font>. NOTE: At this point you have
a terminal window and any text input from the keyboard will go directly to
the modem after pressing the return key. 
<li>Enter the recommended initialization string from your modem vendor, or
a string of your choice (say, ATZ or AT&F1) followed by the return key.
The modem should respond with "OK" in the terminal window.
<li>Enter the command string to dial EnterAct. This will take the form of
<font color=#bb0000>ATDT</font> followed by the phone number for your
local dialup (example: ATDT8953228 or ATDT9,8953228 if you need to dial 9
for an outside line).
<li>Respond to the prompts for your username and password. If the login is
successful, the terminal window will close and you will be prompted to
save a connection script based upon the terminal window session. To make sure that
you are prompted to save the script, click the <font color=#bb0000>Settings</font>
button at the bottom of the terminal window, and check the <font
color=#bb0000>Prompt to save script on close</font> option.
<li>To use this script for future PPP
connections,
select the <font color=#bb0000>Options</font> button once again in the PPP control
panel. This time in the Protocol section place an "X" beside <font
color=#bb0000>Connect to a command line host</font> and <font
color=#bb0000>Use a connect script</font>.  
<li>Select the <font color=#bb0000>Import Script</font> button.
<li>Select the script saved in step 8 above and click <font
color=#bb0000>Open</font>.
</ol>
<p>Subsequent PPP connection attempts will now use this custom script.
