	Our directory is designed to assist consumers of mental health services 
	in finding a psychotherapist to meet their needs.  This directory contains 
	information reported by therapists throughout the United States and Canada.  
	All information in this directory is self-reported by the therapist.  
	<P>
	Because we 
	are not a referral service, we recommend that you verify all information
	about the therapist you choose before beginning treatment.  
	<P>
	In addition, 
	we have provided you with <a href="infochoi.htm">a number of questions</a> you may wish to ask the 
	therapist in order to make an informed choice.
	<P>
	You may choose to <a href="search.pl.cgi">begin a search</a> immediately or 
	<a href="about.htm">learn more</a> about the Therapist-list 	
	Directory, including how to target your geographical location most effectively 
	and how to narrow your search.  You will also see a sample file.
	<P>
	If you would like to be listed in this directory, please email <a href="mailto:TLIST@enteract.com">
