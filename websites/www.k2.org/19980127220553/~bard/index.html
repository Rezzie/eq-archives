<p> It has finally happened. The rodent has been exiled from his previous
home at Northwestern University. It had to happen eventually. But as
promised, I have found a home for my ramblings. The astute among you will
have noticed that in my new home, I am no longer known as the rodent, but
rather as the bard. Never fear...Bardley Rodent I have ever been, and will
ever be, and I will answer to either should you meet me on the street. But
you should grow accustomed to bard, as after a few more months, mail sent
to rodent will begin to bounce.

As you can see, I'm starting to aim more toward the rambling essay
approach to a web page. Those familiar with previous incarnations know
that while I had a few pretty slick imagemaps, my web pages themselves
have been pretty damned mundane "this is my life story" sorta stuff. I
figure that's dull. Everyone does that. And nobody actually wants to read
it.
<p>
So what can I do to make people read my web page? I don't know. Put a
bunch of porn on it. Well, they won't <b>read</b> it, but it'll get a lot
of hits. Put links to all the other groovy sites on the web. Maybe I'll
get hits, but only by folks passing through to find all my Babylon 5
links...and once they bookmark those for themselves, all my traffic will dissappear.
<p>
So my guess is for a rambling kinda essay thing. I like to ramble. I like
to write essays. I like to show off my thoughts in a public sort of way
without the pressure of feeling like I'll be judged. So I figure that's
the way to go with my web page. Will it get me more hits? Probably not. I
certainly won't drag in all the adolescents looking for porn. They'll see
text and the word "politics" and flee like little bunnies. But if I do
get a coupla readers, cool.
<p>
And if not...hell, I'll just write anyway. It'll keep me occupied, if no
one else. So get yourself a beer, turn on some music, and browse away.
