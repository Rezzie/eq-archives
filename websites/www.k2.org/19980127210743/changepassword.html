<h1>Change Your Password</h1>
</center>
<hr>

Your password is the key to the security of your account. If your 
password is compromised, people other than yourself can access your
account, potentially incurring extra charges or violating the privacy
of your communications. It is thus important that you <b>make sure your
password is kept confidential</b> at all times. Change your 
password often!<p>
<ol>
<li>Good passwords should contain both <i>letters</i> and 
<i>numbers</i>. 
<li><b>Your password should not appear in a dictionary</b>. 
<li>Passwords may not contain whitespace. Whitespace includes
"space" and "tab". We have code here that depends on passwords not
containing those characters (the usage page, for instance), and our
password programs will not let users use passwords that do.  
</ol>
<p>
Examples of good passwords include things like <samp>el1t0!</samp> and <samp>ra1n+f0o</samp>. 
Examples of bad passwords include <samp>yellow</samp> and
<samp>password</samp>. 
<b>Your password should 
not contain any permutation of your real name or account name</b>.<p>

<hr>

EnterAct subscribers with currently active accounts can change their 
password from this web page. You must know your current password to 
change your password. <b>REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD</b>, there is no 
way to 
recover a forgotten password. If you lose your password, you can contact 
us via telephone at (773) 248-8511, and we'll reset it for you.<p>

Security-conscious people should note that this web page is NOT secured 
with any type of encryption; passwords changed over this web page are 
vulnerable to interception. However, the risk involved in changing your 
password here is no greater than the risk of changing it from your shell 
account via 'telnet'.<p>

Your account name is the name you input when logging onto the system.
It's equivalent to the first part of your email address... i.e., 
<i>yourname</i> in "<i>yourname</i>@enteract.com".<p>

Your password will not be visible as you type it in. If you would like to
see what password you have entered after your password is changed, click 
"show password".<p>
