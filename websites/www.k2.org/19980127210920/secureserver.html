Each secure server user has a directory off of the Secure Server's
document root. The name of this directory can be agreed upon when the user
signs up for secure webservice. Excepting CGI programs, all of the Secure
Server user's documents will be served from this directory.<br><br>

Owing to the sensitivity of the information passing through EnterAct's
secure server, we are unable to offer our clients any direct access to the
server. The only access to the secure server is at the console.<br><br>

Although Secure Server users will not have any means to "log on" to the
SSL server to update their directories, we do provide our clients with a
means to have documents periodically copied over to the secure server.
Clients with the Secure Server option will have a "secure-dist" directory
situated off of their "vhost_domain.com" directory. Any files placed in
that directory will be kept current on our secure server at half-hour
intervals.  <br><br>

All URLs referring to the secure server should look like:<br><br>

<center><b>&lt;a href="https://shekels.enteract.com/...&gt;</b></center><br>

CGI programs are referred to in the cgi-bin directory off the server root,
i.e. "https://shekels.enteract.com/cgi-bin/cgiemail".<br><br>

Because CGI programs constitute a major security risk, we are very careful
about what we allow access to from the server. We provide a modified
version of the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/wwwdev/cgiemail">MIT DCNS 'cgiemail' program
</a>, which will handle arbitrary
HTML FORM input, and will return the output via email. Our modified
version returns the output PGP encrypted, to a special mailbox on our main
mail server. The name of this mailbox will be determined when the user
signs up for secure service. 
<br><br>

Other CGI programs *may* be used; however, before we allow them to be
installed on our secure server, we'll need to review the source code.
Third party CGI programs *must* encrypt form output before mailing it out,
although they don't necessarilly have to mail it to any particular special
mailbox. We highly recommend the use of PGP for this purpose.<br><br>

PGP is a popular "public key" encryption program. "Public key" encryption
is a form of data security that renders data unreadable to parties that
don't share a "secret" that allows the data to be decoded. "Public key"
encryption allows the "secret" to be split into two parts. One part of the
secret allows someone to encode a message, the other part allows the
message to be decoded.<br><br>

The encoding, or "encrypting", secret is called the "public key". People
possessing somone's public key can encrypt messages for that person so
that nobody, even the person who created the message, can decrypt it
without the other half of the secret. The public key does not normally
allow any party to decode messages.

The decoding, or "decrypting", secret is called the "private key". The
person who holds the private key can decrypt messages encrypted with the
corresponding public key. <br><br>

A public key can be distributed to many different people, so that a group
of people can encrypt messages. A private key must be kept secret. PGP
stores the private key in a file that can only be accessed through PGP,
with a password. It also keeps a "ring" of public keys, any of which allow
the user to encrypt messages for other people.<br><br>

In order to make use of EnterAct's Secure Server, we need to get a PGP
public key to encrypt form output. You can find PGP, and much more
information about PGP, at <a href="http://www.PGP.com">http://www.PGP.com</a>.
Public domain versions of PGP are also available at <a href="ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/pgp">
ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/pgp</a>. PGP is quite simple to install,
although the details vary depending on the operating system you're using.
Feel free to give EnterAct technical support a call if you're having any
trouble getting the program working. You'll need to generate a PGP
keypair, and, after doing so, you'll need to export the "public" key into
a text file. If you're using command-line PGP to do this, the commands
should be:<br><br>

<center>
<table border=0>
<tr><td><b>pgp -kg</b><td>(generate keypair)
<tr><td><b>pgp -kxa</b><td>(export key into file)
</table></center><br>


Email the file to <a href="mailto:support@enteract.com">support@enteract.com</a>, and we'll
install the key on our secure server.

<h3>Internet Explorer 3.0 Secure Server Bug</h3>
<p>Internet Explorer 3.0 has a known bug that causes it to
be unable to access any secured sites that begin with the
https:// prefix.  If the secure server is set to accept http://
connections (as is the case with our very own shekels.enteract.com) all is
well, but any attempt to connect via https:// is rejected and
given a generic error. Netscape Navigator does not have this problem.
