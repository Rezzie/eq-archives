<h1>When do groups expire their articles?</h1>

<br>A brief introduction to our news server: news.enteract.com
is a SPARC 5/110 running Solaris 2.5 and the news server package,
INN1.4UNOFF4.  We have 21 Gb of striped, concatenated (RAID level 0)
disk space allocated to the news spool, and an
additional 4.2 Gb for the operating system and other news server
files.
<p>
As of January 1997, it is typical for us to receive 5Gb of news a day
in approximately 250,000 articles.

<p>We aspire to hold the most useful articles as long as we can; here
is our current expiration policy explaining at what point we delete
articles from the news spool:

<ul>

<li> The newsgroup hierarchies comprising the "Big 8" (<em>comp</em>, <em>humanities</em>, <em>misc</em>,
<em>news</em>, <em>rec</em>, <em>sci</em>, <em>soc</em> and
<em>talk</em>) expire after <b>14</b> days, with the exception that
articles with <tt>Expires:</tt> headers (typically newsgroup charters
or FAQs) are allowed to remain in the spool up to 31 days after they are
posted.

<p>

<li>The hierarchies <em>alt</em>, <em>bionet</em>, <em>linux</em> and
<em>microsoft</em> also expire after <b>14</b> days and articles with
<tt>Expires:</tt> headers are allowed to remain in the spool up to 31
days after they are posted.

<br><br>There are some exceptions to the 14 day <em>alt.*</em> expiration policy, due
to the huge sizes of these sub-hierarchies:

<ul> 
<li> Groups under <em>alt.sex</em> are expired after <b>3</b> days.
<li> Groups under <em>alt.binaries</em> are expired after <b>1</b> day (as of 12/31/96, 80% of our 5Gb a day of total incoming news was in the alt.binaries hierarchy)
</ul>

<p>

<li>The <em>*.answers</em> groups -- which typically hold the FAQs for
groups in their hierarchies -- are expired after <b>31</em> days, but
held up to 45 days if containing an appropriate <tt>Expires:</tt>
header.

<p>

<li>Articles in the <em>chi</em> and <em>enteract</em> hierarchies are
expired after <b>30</b> days (with the exception of
<em>enteract.news</em>, which is never expired and <em>chi.jobs</em> which is expired after 14 days).

<p>

<li>Articles in any other hierarchy not already mentioned are expired
after <b>7</b> days and articles with <tt>Expires:</tt> headers may
expire as late as 14 days after they are posted.

</ul>

<p>

<li>A few relatively obscure foreign hierarchies (<em>tw</em>,
<em>de</em>, <em>relcom</em>, <em>es</em>, <em>fj</em>,
<em>z-netz</em>, <em>maus</em>, <em>ncar</em>, <em>it</em>,
<em>nl</eM>, <em>ukr</eM>, <em>sfnet</em>, <em>pl</em>, <em>prg</em>)
are expired after <b>2</b> or <b>4</b> days instead of the default 7,
to conserve disk space for articles which we anticipate our users
would be more generally interested in.  <em>However</eM>, if you read
groups in any of these hierarchies, and would prefer that the expire
time be increased, drop us a line and we would be more than happy to
comply.  (The rest of the obscure foreign hierarchies expire after
<b>7</b> days). <tt>:-)</tt>

<p>

<li>The internal news server newsgroups <em>control, control.cancel and
control.sendsys</em> are expired after <b>1</b> day (the other groups in the
<em>control</em> hierarchy are expired after the default <b>7</b> days.

<p>

<li><em>*.jobs.*</em> newsgroups expire articles after <b>7</b> days,
except <em>chi.jobs</em> which is retained <b>14</b> days.

</ul>
