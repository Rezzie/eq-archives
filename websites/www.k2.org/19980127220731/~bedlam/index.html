<P>My name is Chris McGrath, I'm 19 years old, and I run Bedlam Enterprises.  
I'm a sophomore Computer Science major at 
<a href="http://www.csam.iit.edu/">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>.  
I'm largely interested in punk rock and related 
music, and I love playing guitar and singing.  Below are a list of the web
pages that are on this account.</P>
<P>Have a look around, and drop me an email at
<a href=mailto:bedlam@enteract.com>bedlam@enteract.com</a>.</p>

<P><a href="http://www.phreakco.com/punksg/">Punks G Hybrid</a> - a cool 
punk zine that I write for.  My column is called "The Trendy Revolution."
<br>
<a href="http://worldchat.com/vic/wwp">Worldwide Punk</a> - great punk rock 
web page with music and zine reviews, and TONS of links to Bands, Labels, 
Distros, Catalogs, Zines, and more.
