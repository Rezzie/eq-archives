<p><h3>Digital vs. Analog</h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>If you cannot connect successfully with NT 4.0, try an analog number.  
There have been reports of people not being able to connect automatically 
(although they are fine if they dial manually) with the digital modems.

<p><h3>Service Pack 2</h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>
If you do experience problems dialing into our digital numbers, try
applying the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/proxy/common/download_sp.htm" target="_top">Service
Pack 2</a> from Microsoft. Once that is installed, you
will also have to apply the following fix to it.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain the Post Service Pack Hotfix, ras-fix, from Microsoft by going 
<a 
href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP2/ras-fix/"
target="_top">here</a>.
<li>Click <font color=#bb0000>Readme.txt</font> to find out which version of the fix you need to download.
<li>Apply the fix according the the readme file in step 2.
</ol>
</font>
<p><h3>The Domain Field</h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>When you dial NT, you are prompted for your username, password, and
domain.  Leave the domain field <b>blank</b> or you will have trouble
logging in successfully.
