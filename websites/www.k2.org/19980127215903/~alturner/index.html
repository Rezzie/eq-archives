As long as we leave the care of the soul out of our daily lives we will suffer the loneliness of living in a cold, dead, unrelated world. We will continue to exploit nature and our capacity to invent new things, but both will continue to overpower us, if we do not approach them with enough depth and imagination. (Thomas Moore)<P>

If you came here in the hopes of finding Serenity: You may eventually do that, but probably not from reading these pages. Instead, what I hope for, is that what you find here will stimulate you into a deep introspective search.<P>

On the pages that follow these you will find a variety of topics covered. Perhaps you will find, not answers, but the ability to ask yourself the right questions, the ones that will lead you to your "PATH." <P>
