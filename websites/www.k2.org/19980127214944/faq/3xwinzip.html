<font color=#110860><h3>Installing WinZip</h3></font>
<ol>
<li>Download WinZip from either <A HREF="HTTP://www.tucows.com"
target="_top">http://www.tucows.com</a> or 
<A HREF="HTTP://www.winzip.com" target="_top">http://www.winzip.com</a>.
<li>Copy the file you just downloaded to a unique directory.  Call it winzip if you like.
<li>Run the program by double clicking the file you just saved to the winzip directory or folder.
<li>This will take you through WinZip's setup wizard. 
<li>The setup is pretty self-explanatory, but at one point you will be asked which directory you want to install WinZip into.
<li>Click <font color=#bb0000>OK</font> to keep the default.
<li>You will also be asked if you want to do an express setup or a custom setup. 
Choose <font color=#bb0000>express</font>.  
<li>This will finish the installation and create all of your icons for you.  
<li>Open Winzip by double clicking the icon that was just created.
<li>You will see the following screen:

<font color=#110860><h3>Unzipping Files</h3></font>
<ol>
<li>To unzip a file, click <font color=#bb0000>Open</font>.
<li>Choose the file you wish to unzip and double click it.  
<p>

<p>
<li>If you know the directory you want to put these files in, click the <font color=#bb0000>Extract</font> icon and choose the appropriate directory.  WinZip will take these files and put them in the directory of your choosing.
<li>If you wish to have WinZip not only unzip the files but also install the program, click <font color=#bb0000>Check Out</font>.  
<li>You can change the folder if you don't want the program to be installed in the default folder.  
<li>When you've chosen the folder, click <font color=#bb0000>OK</font>.
<li>If there is an install.exe or setup.exe to be run in the program you are unzipping, WinZip will run it.
<li>When you finish, and wish to close out WinZip, you will be asked if you want WinZip to delete the folder and icons it 
just created.  Unless you want these things to be deleted, click <font color=#bb0000>No</font>.
</ol>
