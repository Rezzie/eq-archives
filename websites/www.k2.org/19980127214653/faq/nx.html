<li>If you haven't already, download News Express from <A HREF="HTTP://www.tucows.com" 
target="_top">www.tucows.com</A>.
<li><A HREF="zip.html">Unzip</A> the program into its own directory on your hard drive.
<li>Run the <code><font color=#bb0000>nx.exe</font></code> file that is created after you have unzipped the downloaded file.
<li>Once you're in the main menu, go to <font color=#bb0000>Config/Setup</font> from the pull-down menus.

<p>
<li>You will see the following screen:
<p>
<center><img src="Nwsexprs/setup2.gif"></center>
<p>
<li>The <font color=#bb0000>NNTP Server</font> should be <font color=#bb0000>news.enteract.com</font>.
<li>The <font color=#bb0000>SMTP Server</font> should be <font color=#bb0000>smtp.enteract.com</font>.
<li>Enter your name, or whatever name you'd like, in the <font color=#bb0000>Fullname</font> field.
<li>In the <font color=#bb0000>E-Mail</font> field, enter your e-mail address, <font
color=#bb0000>username@enteract.com</font>.
<li>The rest of the fields can be left alone.  Click <font color=#bb0000>OK</font> when done.
<li>Now choose <font color=#bb0000>Preferences</font> from the <font color=#bb0000>Config</font> pull-down menu.
<li>You will see the following screen:
<p>
<center><img src="Nwsexprs/pref.gif"></center>
<p>
<li>You want to select <font color=#bb0000>Retrieve new groups only [if any]</font>.  This will make News Express bring down
only new news groups as opposed to every single news group (there are over 18,000 of them) every time you connect to the news 
server.
<li>The rest of the options are up to you.  Feel free to look through all the tabs and change whatever settings you desire.  
When done, click <font color=#bb0000>OK</font>.  
<li>To connect to the news server for the first time, go to <font color=#bb0000>File/Connect</font>.  When you have
finished downloading all of the newsgroups, you will see the following screen:
<p>

<IMG SRC="Nwsexprs/all.gif"></IMG>
</center>
<p>
<li>Now, because you don't want to be subscribed to all 18,000+ groups (who has time to read them all anyway??), you want to
subscribe to only those that interest you.  News Express allows you to search for the groups you want.  Let's say you want to see 
all of the music groups.  You would then just type <font color=#bb0000>music</font> in the <font color=#bb0000>Filter</font>
field located at the bottom of the screen.  You would see the following screen:<br>
<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="Nwsexprs/music.gif"></IMG>
</center>
<p>
<li>As you can see, only the groups with the string <font color=#bb0000>music</font> are listed.  To subscribe to one of them, 
just click the checkbox located to the left of the group name. 
<li>Each time you connect to the news server, you will see only the groups you are subscribed to unless you go to
<font color=#bb0000>View/All Groups</font>.  In addition when you connect, if there are new groups added to EnterAct's news
server, you will be prompted if you want to subscribe to these or not.
<li>To read the articles in a group, simply double click the group you want to go into and then double click the article you
want to read.
<li>That should get you started.  For more information about News Express, check out their on-line Help menu from the main screen.
