<h1>Bandwidth Usage</h1>
<h3>Your EnterAct account has a bandwidth restriction on your web page 
and public ftp areas, here's why.</h3>

<hr>

<p>Most Internet service providers restrict what you can and cannot put 
up on your web 
page, not so much because they wish to trample on your first amendment 
rights, but to keep their network running smoothly. To this end, many 
providers have rules regarding site content and stipulations against 
reselling your personal web space or using it for commercial purposes, in 
order to prevent excessive traffic through your site that might interfere 
with network operations.

<p>At EnterAct, we don't like placing rules on what sort of materials you 
can and 
cannot access and make publically accessible. Frankly, it's none of our 
business. But like any other reputable provider we too want to keep our 
network 
running smoothly for all of our users. We place bandwidth 
restrictions on your public areas in 
order to ensure that our services are not unfairly dominated by a few 
users with particularly busy web sites. There's no reason why most of our 
users 
should experience slower connections to their own web pages or have to pay 
higher bills for extra equipment at our site because of the higher bandwidth 
requirements of a few.

<p>Our SoloAct accounts have a bandwidth limitation of 250M per month, 
while 
our CompleteAct accounts are limited to 1 gigabyte, the equivalent of 
1,000M of bandwidth per month. An additional gigabyte of bandwidth is 
available for $25 per month, with our usual discounts for 
quarterly and annual pre-payment.

<p>If your web page were ever to exceed it's applicable bandwidth 
limit, you would not be charged without us first contacting you to 
see what you'd like to do about your site's popularity. Often, graphic
file sizes can be trimmed and other modifications can be made to reduce the 
amount of bandwidth used by your site. 

<p>To calculate bandwidth for a particular web page, you would add the 
size of the page and the size of all it's graphics, and multiply that by 
the average number of times per month that page is accessed. If you have 
files available through FTP, you would multiply file sizes by the number 
of access here as well. 

<p>Your access frequency can be deduced by <a href="counter.html">using a page counter</a> or by 
studying the log files available to CompleteAct account users.
