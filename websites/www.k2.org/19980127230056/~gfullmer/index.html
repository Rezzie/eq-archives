<LI><a href="christ1.gif">All-time Favorite Friend and Engineer</a>, 
known for his genetic and mechanical engineering, using mechanisms still yet
to be understood.

Writings</a> from my favorite computer ace, Doug Engelbart,  and his 
current <a href="http://beluga.dc.isx.com/bootstrap/final/index.htm">
organization</a> to facilitate corporate thinking. 
An <a href="http://innovate.si.edu/history/engel/engeltoc.htm"> interview</a> with him.  
He is the inventor of <a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/augmentation.html"> the mouse</a>, GUI windowing systems, outline
processing systems, hypertext, shared-screen teleconferencing,
composite-graphics-text computer files and Augment (a collaberative work
environment) and all this in the late 1960s!  A man 25 years ahead of his time.
Now he is trying to teach "Bootstraping" - A way for human organizations to cope
with complexity and urgency using these technologies.

Richard Feynman. Was this great physicist behind the Cold Fusion fiasco
from beyond the grave?  You probably know him better as the practical one on
the Shuttle Disaster Commission.  Some know him for his diagrams, drum
playing in Brazil, working on the atom-bomb and safe-cracking.  Did I mention
that he got a Nobel Prize for equations about the "wobbles"?  ;-)
