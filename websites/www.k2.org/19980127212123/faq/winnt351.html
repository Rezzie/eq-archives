<font color=#000000>
<p>Win NT uses something called RAS (Remote Access Service) to dial up.  In 
3.5, the software isn't already installed, although it is easily added.  Go 
to your Network icon in your control panels and choose to add software.  The 
software to be added is RAS.  Once that is added, you will have a RAS program 
group with the RAS dialer icon.  When you open that icon up, you will have to 
add a phone book entry for EnterAct and enter all of your settings such as DNS 
addresses, username, password, etc.
<p>In the setup of NT 3.51, there will be a dialog box that asks for
username, password, and domain name when you try to dial.  Rather than
entering enteract.com for the domain, <b>leave the field blank</b>.

<p><a name=ntbaud><h3>Baud Rate</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>Try lowering your baud rate.  With some modems, if your baud rate is
too high, you may not connect well, or even at all.  If you have a 28,800
modem, try setting your baud rate to 57,600 bps.  And if you have a 14,400
modem, try setting it to 38,400.  You can always try raising it up to
115,200 for 28.8 modems or 57,600 for 14,400 modems to see if you can
achieve faster speeds.
