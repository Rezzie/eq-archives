<CENTER>or "How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Beauracracy."</CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="rule01.gif" HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=468></CENTER>
This is my homepage, such as it is.&nbsp; Many have tried and many have
failed to make their webpages show the "true essence", "pure individuality"
and the "incredible uniqueness of character" that makes them who they are.&nbsp;
I will not attempt such a thing.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that this is <U>some</U>
of me, and it is quite likely that too much of me would nauseate you...as
it nauseates me.

<P>Given the fact that tradition is often traditional for good reasons,
I <U>will</U> include a <A HREF="#Short Biograph">short biograph</A>, links
to <A HREF="#Friends Home Pages">friends' webpages</A>, and the obligatory
pictures of family, and travels.&nbsp; A short resume is also included,
though I am not actively looking for employment . Any offers over $70k
will be considered seriously based on the stability of the organization
and position.&nbsp; I have often said that I would never work for anyone
else again, but nearly everything has its price.&nbsp; ;)

<P>Why the sub-title?&nbsp; Well, everyone has little themes, subplots
and motifs in their lives.&nbsp; Independence and romantic intrigues dominate
the psyche of the 16 year old, other themes are suppressed while this duet
overwhelms the teenager's life.&nbsp; The college student is beaten with
academics and financial poverty, all else is simply background noise.&nbsp;
As sole proprietor of a three year old Computer Consulting and Repair business
(On-Site Computers), governmental beauracracy has forced itself to the
front of the stage and insists on making an attempt as soloist.&nbsp; The
<U>great</U> majority of this paperwork is related to<A HREF="Taxpage.html">
taxes</A>.&nbsp; When a new business is started in Chicago... the city,
state and federal governments all scramble over one another to take their
cut of the small business owner's hard-earned money.&nbsp; Most people
don't notice or care, because they are snuggled into their cubes at offices
working for someone else.&nbsp; Being self-employed is treated like a crime
in this country.&nbsp; The punishment is in the form of seemingly endless
annual fines (taxes)&nbsp; for this, that and the other-thing.&nbsp; These
taxes are above and beyond the <A HREF="Taxpage.html">income taxes</A>
that the rest of Americans have to pay.&nbsp; If you happen to be an employer,
god-forbid, then the government gorges itself on you with a second wave
of taxes.&nbsp; If it weren't for my wife, Charmaine, I don't think that
I would have ever "learned to stop worrying and love beauracracy".&nbsp;
(My ever-efficient wife, Charmaine,&nbsp; takes care of all of the paperwork,
so that all I have to do is make enough money to pay the glutinous governmental
gangsters their protection money.)

<P>One year after the summer of love, I was born in the summer of 1968.&nbsp;
The year of the infamous Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where
Mayor Daley Sr. had his goons (the Chicago police) beat up demonstrators.&nbsp;
Two days after I was born, the Soviet tanks rolled into Prague (the capital
of what is now the Czech Republic) to put an end to the "Prague Spring
" liberalization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated
in Memphis and Robert Kennedy was assassinated in California.&nbsp; This
was also the year that marked Vietnam as the longest war in United States'
history.

<P>Born: 1968
<BR>Siblings: 1 Brother, 1 Sister, both older
<BR>High School: East Peoria Community High
<BR>Activities:&nbsp; Debate, Band (Trumpet, Euphonium), Grace Presbyterian
Church, AFS Student to <A HREF="CRica.html">Costa Rica</A>
<BR>College:&nbsp; University of Illinois,&nbsp; Degree in Philosophy,
but spent most of my time working on my computer.
<BR>Illinois <A HREF="Army.html">Army</A> National Guard:&nbsp; Enlisted
December, 1986 as a Private.&nbsp; Transferred to Inactive Ready Reserve
July, 1995 as a First Lieutenant.
<BR>Branch:&nbsp;<A HREF="Army.html"> Infantry</A>&nbsp; Awards: Army Commendation
Medal (twice), Overseas Service Ribbon, Humanitarian Service Ribbon

<P>My parents worked hard and were frugal enough to send my siblings and
I to a number of "summer camp" activities.&nbsp; I met my wife-to-be at
ISYM (Illinois Summer Youth Music) Camp&nbsp; when I was 11 years old.&nbsp;
We were close friends through the years and finally got married March of
1997.

<P>My trip to Costa Rica influenced my attitudes about the world greatly.&nbsp;
Having grown-up in the mid-west, I leaned strongly to the right concerning
social issues.&nbsp; After living in another country and culture for a
few months, I became aware of the fact that many of our social norms are
artificial, cruel and downright evil.&nbsp; The racism, sexism and homophobia
that surrounded me and seemed to blend into the background before I went
to Costa Rica, now seemed to stick out like a neon sign.

<P>Travel has always been the best way to learn a huge amount of information
about the world in a very short period of time.&nbsp; I learned more in
three months in Costa Rica than I did in the rest of my 4 years of high
school.&nbsp; Other countries I have visited are: Honduras (with the Army),&nbsp;
and Scotland.&nbsp; I have also been through parts of Canada, Guatemala,
and El Salvador.

<P>My interest in computers began with my neighbor's father purchasing
a TRS-80 when I was between 8-10 years old.&nbsp; Jim McCubbin and I would
have to type-in the BASIC programs prior to playing the games.&nbsp; Games
like Hunt the Wumpus, Hammurabi, etc... were the coolest thing at the time.&nbsp;
My next brush with computers was when my brother (6 years older) was taking
a course at a community college.&nbsp; While he was in class, he would
let me log into the main-frame using his account name and password.&nbsp;
I was around 10 and I spent the whole time playing ADVENT.&nbsp; When there
weren't any regular terminals available I would play it on the printer
terminal (it printed out everything on the old green and white 14 inch
wide computer paper).&nbsp; What a waste of paper!&nbsp; But this way I
could take the printout home with me and study it more in-debth. After
that I fell in love with AppleII's.&nbsp; I would copy everything I could
get my hands on using the standard tools like "Locksmith", "Nibbler", "Clone
Kit", "Pirate's Friend".&nbsp;&nbsp; The pinnacle of my software copy-protection
cracking career was copying Wizardry.&nbsp; (I had to remove the cover
on the Disk Drive and turn a screw on a variable resistor in order to alter
the spin-speed of the disk in order to copy it.)&nbsp; The coolest games
of that time were "Hard Hat Mac", "Aztec", "Wizardry", "Lode Runner", "Galactic
Empire".&nbsp; Occasionally I have to pull out the old AppleII and play
them for nostalgia's sake.

<P>I didn't get much time to work on C64's or any Texas Instruments computers,
but most of the same titles were available on those machines as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In college I was introduced to the IBM XT.&nbsp; I bought my first computer
on a credit card.&nbsp; For just under $3,000, I got a 286-12MHz computer
with 2 Mb RAM,&nbsp; a 20Mb hard-drive, and a VGA card and Monitor.&nbsp;
A real steal at the time.&nbsp; Since then I have been trying to ride this
monster-wave, we call "the computer revolution".
