<h2>Change Your Password</h2>
<hr><p>
<center>
Your password is the key to the security of your account. If your 
password is comprimised, people other than yourself can access your
account, potentially incurring extra charges or violating the privacy
of your communications. It is thus important that you <i>make sure your
password is kept confidential</i> at all times. <i>Change your password 
often!</i><p>
Good passwords should contain both <i>letters</i> and <i>numbers</i>. 
Your password <i>should not appear in a dictionary</i>. Examples of good 
passwords include things like "el1t0!" and "ra1n+f0o". Examples of bad 
passwords include "yellow" and "password". <i>Your password should not 
contain any permutation of your real name or account name</i>.<p>
<hr><p>
EnterAct subscribers with currently active accounts can change their 
password from this web page. You must know your current password to 
change your password. <i>REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD</i>... there is no way to 
recover a forgotten password. If you lose your password, you can contact 
us via telephone at (312) 248-8511, and we'll reset it for you.<p>
Security-conscious people should note that this web page is NOT secured 
with any type of encryption; passwords changed over this web page are 
vulnerable to interception. However, the risk involved in changing your 
password here is no greater than the risk of changing it from your shell 
account via 'telnet'.<p>

Your account name is the name you input when logging onto the system.
It's equivalent to the first part of your email address... i.e., 
"yourname" in "yourname@enteract.com".<p>

Your password will not be visible as you type it in. If you would like to
see what password you have entered after your password is changed, click 
"show password".<p>
