<font COLOR="#000000">
<p>All communication programs, whether it be Terminal, Hyperterminal, ProComm, Telix, or RipTerm, are essentially 
configured in the same way.  Make sure the following settings are correctly entered in your software.
<ol>
<li>Parity = <font color=#bb0000>None</font>
<li>Data Bits = <font color=#bb0000>8</font>
<li>Stop Bits = <font color=#bb0000>1</font>  
<li>Flow Control = <font color=#bb0000>Hardware</font>
</ol>
</font>
<p><a name=termemu><h3>Terminal Emulation</h3></a>
<font COLOR="#000000">
<p>This should be set to either <font color=#bb0000>VT100</font> or <font
color=#bb0000>VT102</font>. If it is set incorrectly
(ANSI for example), your screen will not look right and the formatting will be all wrong.  Simply changing the Terminal Emulation makes all the difference.
</font>
<p><a name=comport><h3>Com Port</h3></a>
<font COLOR="#000000">
<p>If you are having trouble dialing out, verify that the Com Port you are
using is the correct one.  If you are unsure, try Com1 first and then Com2, and so on.   If the wrong com port is selected, the modem will not dial.
</font>
<p><a name=commbaud><h3>Baud Rate</h3></a>
<font COLOR="#000000">
<p>Try lowering your baud rate.  With some modems, if your baud rate is
too high, you may not connect well, or even at all.  If you have a 28,800
modem, try setting your baud rate to <font color=#bb0000>57,600</font> bps. And if you
have a 14,400
modem, try setting it to <font color=#bb0000>38,400</font>.  You can always try
raising it up to
115,200 for 28.8 modems or 57,600 for 14,400 modems to see if you can
achieve faster speeds.
</font>
<p><a name=badlogin><h3>Bad Login?</h3></a>
<font COLOR="#000000">
<p>Make sure you log in with an <font color=#bb0000>R</font> in front of your username.
The username must be lower case.  The password is case sensitive and must be
typed exactly as it was created.  Remember, when dialing into the shell with a communication program, 
you will be prompted for your password twice.  This is normal.  If you mis-type your
password the second time, you will have to re-enter your username <b>without</b> the
<font color=#bb0000>R</font>.  This is because the first password logs you into the
terminal server (which is why the R is needed.  Without it, the terminal server would think you were trying to
obtain a PPP connection).  The second password logs you into the UNIX system (usernames must be all lower case, so the R would result in a bad login.)
