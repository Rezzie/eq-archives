		<FONT SIZE=+1>What software do I need for EnterAct, and where can I get it?</FONT>


<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#8c1010">Macintosh Network Software</FONT></STRONG>


<P>We offer some subset of the following on our "Internet Suite" disk for $30.  All of
the following is free if you can get it off the Internet yourself, or from a friend.

<P><FONT COLOR="#1020a2">If you're new to these waters, we suggest you read the following thoroughly to 
prevent compatibility problems.</FONT>


<P>Basically you need three things:<BR>


<OL>
        
        <P><LI><STRONG>A Dial-up package</STRONG>.  <BR>
        If you think you may already have network software, do a find (Command-F
        from the desktop) for "ConfigPPP."  If you find it in your "Control Panels,"
        you can skip this step.
       
		<P><A HREF="http://www.rockstar.com/ppp.shtml">FreePPP</A> is what 
        we recommend (because we've used it, we like it, and we know
        how to set it up), but there are others - MacPPP, etc.
        
        <P>If you have system 7.5.3, then you should be running with
        Open Transport 1.1, and you may already have MacPPP, which is
        fine and dandy.  If not, you should download FreePPP 2.5a. 
        
        <P>If you have an earlier system, download FreePPP 1.0.5.
          
                 
        <P><LI><STRONG>A Browser</STRONG><BR>
        Again, many choices.  We recommend <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape 2.0.2</A> - it support
        the widest array of features, and is usually the first to innovate
        the cool new stuff.  Also, Microsoft's Internet Explorer runs
        much slower on a mac than Netscape (sorry Bill!).
        
        <P>You can also buy it from most major bookstores (Borders comes to mind),
        and it's included in the Apple Internet Connection Kit.

        <P><LI><STRONG>MacTCP or TCP/IP</STRONG><BR>
        If you have system 7.5.3, you're running Open Transport 1.1 (or you should be),
        and you should see "TCP/IP" under your control panels.  Otherwise, you should find
        MacTCP under your control panels.  You're set.
        
        <P>There's an outside chance that you have an older system (NOT 7.5.3), but you 
        still see TCP/IP under your control panels.  Not to worry.  However, if you have
        an earlier version than 1.1 (notably 1.0.8), you need to upgrade to 
        Open Transport 1.1.  Open Transport 1.0.8 is unreliable.  At the moment, Open Transport 1.1 is only
        available as part of system 7.5.3.  It is possible to de-install 1.0.8 and use
        MacTCP exclusively (they are mutually incompatible).
        
        <P>If you don't see either one, you may be able
        to install what you need from your original system disk.  Check your manual.

<P>We're assuming you are using <STRONG>FreePPP 1.0.5.</STRONG>
(see <A HREF="products.html">'net 'ware</A> for availability).  It's compatible with
just about every mac machine and system <I>except</I> system 7.5.3.  Other
products (MacPPP, Apple Internet Dialer) have essentially the same set-up that follows. 
Note, Apple Internet Dialer requires you to go through a registration process first.  
Please complete this before trying the following set-up (or you'll just
get an error message when you try to connect).



<P><A HREF="http://www.rockstar.com/ppp.shtml">

FreePPP 2.5</A> is Open Transport Compatible and is the product of choice if you've recently
upgraded to system 7.5.3 (NOTE: If you've <I>purchased</I> a machine with 7.5.3 installed,
you should also already have MacPPP - do a "Find" to check).  The settings for FreePPP 2.5 are 
the same, but the set-up is different.  Generally we think it's more intuitive, but if you 
can successfully download and install 7.5.3 by yourself, then you can probably figure out 
FreePPP 2.5 as well.
