<H1 align=center>What is a Labor Assistant?</h1>
<P>A new trend in childbirthing is having a 
professional support person to help mom during 
labor and delivery. A doula (doo-la), also called a 
labor or childbirth assistant, comes from the 
Greek and, literally translated, means &quot;in service of.&quot; 
A doula is a woman who helps a mother with birth and early postpartum. She stays with 
the mother continuously during labor and birth, supporting her in whatever way necessary. 
The doula is familiar with hospital policies and procedures and has extensive training and 
birth experience.
<P><IMG align=left SRC="./rachel2.JPG" WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="157">
Working with two partners such as your husband and a labor support person has its 
advantages. The two can relieve each other at 
times and work together at times. Some women or couples like an additional person who 
has perspective and experience. It takes the 
pressure off the husband to &quot;do it all&quot; as a birth partner.  
<p>

<P>A labor support person can make concrete suggestions for comfort measures, help 
you remember some of the things you learned in childbirth class, remind you and your 
caregiver (doctor or midwife) of your birth plan, and 
raise your morale.  
<P>With the unfamiliarity and stress of labor, you might welcome an experienced, calm 
advocate who can remain with you through the birth. 
A professional labor assistant can offer you an experienced perspective, steady 
encouragement, and specific help, and can also work with 
you and the staff as a go-between or advocate. 

<h1 align=center>Finding Comfort in Labor</h1>

<P>Many women feel they have prepared for 
birth. However, when attended by strangers in an unfamiliar hospital setting, they feel 
unprepared and frightened. For instance, often just when 
a woman is getting to know one set of hospital personnel, the shift changes and she has 
to adjust all over again.
<P>A woman who is not used to hospital terminology may feel as if she is in a foreign country 
where she does not understand the language. It can 
be frustrating and alarming to be ignorant about what is being done to her and why. 
<p><IMG align=right SRC="./amy2.JPG" WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="170">

<P>Even if a woman asks, the response is often obscured by technical jargon.  Having a guide 
is vitally important. This is where the doula 
comes in. She acts as a guide, translator, and 
interpreter. American society prizes &quot;safety first.&quot; 
To most people more technology means 
&quot;safer.&quot; Birth has moved away from a simple, 
natural home setting, requiring little or no 
intervention, to the complex, high-tech environment of 
the hospital. Due to the increase of medical 
technology some level of intervention has become routine in almost all hospital births.
<P>Women's labor, a natural event, has come more and more part of a technological system 
driven by policies, procedures, and profits. All of this 
is done in the name of &quot;safety&quot; for mother 
and child. Unfortunately, the cesarean section rate 
in the United States has increased from 5% to 25% in fifteen years. One in four women now 
has major surgery to deliver a baby. Many of the very interventions meant to make the birth 
more safe may actually make a cesarean more likely.    




<h1 align=center>Assisted Birth Statistics</h1>

<P>Since medical technology is here to stay, 
and home birth is not an option for every woman, there needs to be a &quot;bridge over the gap.&quot; 
One answer is the use of a professional childbirth assistant as part of the birth team. 
Recent controlled trials involving more than one 
thousand women demonstrate that the presence of a labor assistant results in:
<P>&#183; 50% decrease in cesarean sections
<P>&#183; 25% decrease in length of labor
<P>&#183; 30% decrease in use of forceps
<P>&#183; 40% decrease in use of oxytocin
<P>&#183; 60% decrease in use of epidurals
<P>&#183; 30% decrease in use of pain medications

<P>Further long-term benefits of labor support include: less trauma in birth; improved 
breast-feeding results; decreased postpartum 
depression; greater maternal satisfaction; better mother-infant interaction.
<P>These statistics translate into 
cost-effectiveness because intervention procedures (often 
accompanied by extended hospital care) are very 
expensive. The doula offers experienced objective assistance.  
<P>Many women are waiting until they are older to have children and they often choose to have 
only one baby. With only one chance to create a 
joyful birth experience, it is vital to make that 
one birth as fulfilling and happy as it can be.

<P>The doula's presence allows the laboring 
woman to relax and to feel safe and in control. 
Because the labor assistant offers physical and 
emotional support and information about 
child-birthing, available technology, and natural 
alternatives, the mother is then free to focus on her body 
and the normal birth process, while the medical personnel monitor the birth.

<h1 align=center>A Labor Assistant's Story</h1>


<P>Angela was a trained doula. She 
was assisting Brita and her husband Rolf, during labor and birth. Angela was aware 
of their birth plans and knew how much they wanted a natural, drug-free, vaginal 
birth with only necessary interventions.  When Brita went into premature labor, 
her physician was out of town. His partner attended the delivery. 
<P>During an exam the nurse asked the physician if he would like an FSE. Rolf 
was confused and alarmed. He whispered to Angela, &quot;What is that?&quot; Angela 
explained that an FSE means &quot;fetal scalp electrode,&quot;which is an internal fetal 
monitor. In this procedure an electrode is inserted under the skin of the baby's scalp. 
<P>If you are having a difficult labor with fetal distress, this medical intervention may 
be very helpful but knowing their birth plan, Angela queried, &quot;Is that what you 
both want?&quot; Rolf answered no and then asked the physician if an internal monitor 
was really necessary and the physician said that it wasn't; the external monitor was          
 adequate. 
<P>Brita's labor progressed smoothly, and they had a healthy girl. Rolf felt included 
and supportive of Brita during the birth, and she felt loved and protected. The couple 
felt in charge of their baby's birth.

<h1 align=center>My Own Commitment</h1>

<IMG SRC="./celeste2.JPG" WIDTH="173" HEIGHT="128">
<P>Unlike most doctors or midwives, as a 
labor support professional I am available to 
follow through with care after the birth. This continuity of personal attention for 
the mother and baby is perhaps one of the doula's greatest contributions. It feels 
safer leaving the hospital, knowing you will have assistance with breast-feeding, 
bathing, sleeping, and any other questions or concerns which may arise.
<P>I began my work with children as a Montessori teacher of children from birth to 
three years old. I owned my own Montessori child care center and still teach parenting 
classes in the Chicago area. I am a labor support professional  and I volunteer at the 
county hospital. My business, Demeter's Montessori Center, provides prenatal 
education, labor support, postpartum assistance, 
and parent consultation in the Montessori and &quot;Active Parenting&quot; methods.

<P><b>As your Childbirth Assistant I will:</b>
<P>&#183;     Meet with you as necessary before 
the baby is born, go to your home in early labor, accompany you throughout 
labor and delivery in the setting of your choice, and schedule as many postpartum 
visits as you would like.  
<P>&#183;     Help you become educated about labor and delivery and formulate what 
is important to you for your birth experience. This is so that I may better 
work with you and your birth team to help you realize your goals.
<P>&#183;     Provide practical suggestions for 
helping you relax and for working with contractions and pain. This may include 
emotional support, variations in position, touch and massage, and many 
other labor support techniques.
<P>&#183;     Help your spouse or partner 
participate more fully in the birth by encouraging him in his own efforts to provide love 
and support.
<P>&#183;     Encourage mother-centered, 
nontechnical childbirth as the safest way to avoid cesarean sections.
<P>&#183;     Support your family in your own 
choices when technology or medication are truly indicated, staying with you and/or 
your baby when unexpected outcomes occur.
