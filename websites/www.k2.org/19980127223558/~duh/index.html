<h4><center>FRAGMENT ONE</center></h4>

<p><strong>When I was ten I was impatient, arrogant, and secure. With nothing to prove I swooned at the sight of goose-stepping Germans. I sat not an inch from the sole television in the neighborhood. If I could have, I would have jumped right in those steel-edged ranks, but the TV belonged to the rich kid of the neighborhoood. So I just sat there in vicarious, thrilling power, the inane chatter of my equally bland and deprived colleagues bouncing off my back. The bombastic preaching of the documentary was of course beside the animated aesthetic point.</P>
I loved to play War. I was serious, honest. If I was surprised and shot I died at once like an Italian actor. Dead, the sky above me seemed a giant church ceiling or slow-motioned wallpaper. The dandilions I had neglected to pull up by the roots interfered with my realism. They sent balls of flaxy itchiness past my aristocratic face, causing me to sneeze. A hero did not give away his position so easily. Nor did a dead man sneeze.</P>
I was always capable of being a leader. I led armies of flat-footed roofing nails (the wide heads, the feet; officers were fewer, taller, regular nails with little heads, hence feet)according to my own rules. I was creative because of my genes? At any rate, also because soldiers were expensive and the nails were there--all I had to do was steal them from the half-hidden barrels in those half-finished houses awaiting next Monday.</P>
I also showed ability at applied scholarship. Thanks to my public library card, my medieval seige machines looked authentic and actually worked. Both the construction and destruction of my cardboard forts thrilled me equally.</P>
I despized cheaters like my older (by ten months) brother, Spike, who would hunch beyond (gasp!)his most advanced nail soldier to aim a (hopefully) allotted marble at my men. Spike obtusely played only to win, probably wishing all the while he could afford less abstract soldiers.  </P>
<p><center>*</center></p>
<P>The Great Depression, honest forge of Daddy, meant nothing to me. I assumed basic food, clothing, shelter. To obtain candy, comic books, toys, stylish rags, and an imported bicycle, I resentfully delivered early morning newspapers. Two routes, crossed bags, practically wore out the skin on both sides of my body. (The bike was eventually stolen at an urban zoo while I was busy sneering at the monkeys. The guard spoke of nappy culprits and suburban naivete.) As young Bootstraps, the reluctant businessman, I found this wisdom: the richer the client, the more demanding. Also, the harder to collect from on the weekends. Work or play, I was forever hissing, "No fair!"</p>
Those who heard me either agreed vehemently or changed the facts to suit themselves. None ever hit me with the proper rejoinder: "Life isn't fair, sonny!" Spike (who only had one morning paper route, so only one of his rib cages was worn out)barely acknowledged me with a grinning scowl, yapping about the latest Pork Chop Hill casualty list numbers, which we followed like baseball scores.  Spike routinely dumped half his rolled up newspapers in a culvert. A philosopher could have easily demonstrated the logic of life's fairness by pointing out the disproportionate number of girls interested in me.</P>
<P>On my morning paper route dwelled the fair and fine-lined little ash blonde, Diane. Her father's lawn was endless; his house, brick. Her kiss was sweetest and filled the air with my rapture. On the swing in the new sandlot Diane swept away the humiliation of Saturday collection day with the mere brush of her lips. Her chief rival was the freckled and chestnut-haired tom-boy Colleen. Colleen ran wild in the seedier, "wooden shack" part of my route, filling the air with rented yet somehow earthy charm. Her fuller lipped kiss seemed a shade less sweet--for lack of distance and pastel shading, maybe? Or was it Diane's intense boreal blue eyes? Colleen's Hershey brown eyes were spaced sufficiently apart from each other that this very expanse between them seemed to me to define the physical borderline beyond which the invisible dial and pivotal pointer of human esthetic delight did not go. Or, maybe Colleen was too easy, or was it her ploys, like always showing up to help my two sisters bake
mud pies on the sun hot cement sidewalk slabs? </P>
<P>The physically darkest element in the neighborhood? A few Italians. I was aware of the terms "Wop" and "Dago" back then, but never applied them. Instead I played spin-the-bottle at an Italian girl's birthday party oblivious of those who never got to go to the dark closet with the dark girl. My mother had sent me off with a small gift. My father possibly would have too although he originated those terms. After all, I was only ten.</P>

<P><center>*</center></P>

I had my introverted side too. I'd sit alone for hours reading precensorship comic books. I cared not for the cold cement of the garage floor, nor for the piles it would surely breed according to my father. I cared even less for his embarrassing interruptions. Why couldn't he ever fall asleep as my legs always did?</P>
Although they soon slumbered, I did not for I was entranced by the surreal landscape of the fifth dimension. The disembodied spirits gaped wide, jagged, and juicy mouths that ripped off human limbs, trousers and all. In my feverish imagination I was that foolish skeptic clad in that complacent, pink-dotted face and those canary yellow shoes. But surely it was a mistake to just walk into the land of shades--even now, in my dotage, I see them rip off that slack jaw and workaday head! Pop that stubby little derby as required! And even now I can still faint over the straining and free-dangling cartoon tendons and meat. Blood samples stun my intellect.</P>
I was both Fear and Fascination. The former was my imaginative nearness, the latter, my real distance. I was involved, yet not. A sane position. I was ready for snuff flicks at Jack's house with the original author Thomas Wolfe hulking in that chic Manhattan wing, but I was not ready for the Manson Family at 10050 Cielo Drive, let alone Treblinka. My taste was acute but confined momentarily to the runes of my own childhood. 

<p><center>*</center>

<p>I was nothing if not loyal to the pen and inky forest edge tradition, to the Brothers Grim, to the grotesque troll under your only narrow rickety wooden bridge, to that ohsoluckylucky Rupunzel strand of hair. I disguised this inate semi-awareness of the fragility of human life in Little Lulu covers for the sake of my innocent mother, who's head occasionally made a wistful pass through the light bar configured by the ajar side garage door. Inside, without any seal of Roman Catholic or state approval, in the mundane gloomy dankness, not far from the antique heavy iron hand mower with the dull blades and loose handle I knew so well, I consumed my pile of REAL WAR and HORROR comics. Some I always found myself rescanning. And one I never escaped: It had the usual trio of stories, and I would always jump to the last: There was the little boy! Once again, he was preparing to sleep, on Christmas Eve. It was no secret he had not behaved properly over the past year, had certainly deserved all those
yells, screams, and hard smacks never awarded his good peers. Never disappointing, this little boy. He always ballooned out to me he would "get even." His
malicious grin and rosy cheeks were never lost on me. I always gave the art of the lines and contours of the printed pulp color dots heady pixels of strict scrutiny. (O magic! Oh evil conjur of dot and line!) Too terrified to follow the plot padding, I'd skip to the heart of the matter, to the last full-page frame. There and then, to tanatalize my feverish curiousity, to milk the sickly thrill of the nauseating verboten, I'd begin my slow scan, fighting off an equal compulsion to rush out into the sun.

<p>The Christmas tree was safe harbor. I'd linger there, appreciating the decorative detail. Near the grand tree's pailed trunk Jack always popped out (Thank God!)of his box amid a vast array of gorgeous silk-ribboned boxes(--these I took to be artistic license). Gathering courage in the wake of such a fantastic lack of socks and 3-pack Fruit Of The Loom underwear, I'd breathe deeply and read the little boy's final dialogue balloon: "Now we can all play with my new Christmas train!"

<p>My generous little playmate had penned a horrid smile on himself. His gleaming eyes were squeezed tight with joyful hysteria. Gut gulping, what could I do but cast my poor witless eyes a tad more down the page? After a reassuring glance at the old lawn mower, so I always did: A toy train, encircling the entire full page Christmas cornucopia in a 3-D mastery of perspective to rival Otto Dix--all exploding out at me! The charming steam-engine, boxcars, and little (red, of course)caboose were stuffed with human meat. A thigh cross-section, like a holiday ham on a butcher's counter for Tubby, always generated the big final wave of nausea. Head spinning, reeling, I'd force my skinny ten-year old torso up and drag my dead prickly pins and needles limbs out into the sunshine. Under the warm sun I could snigger at the tawdry cheapness of it all. It was the little cartoon boy's parents who were chopped up and stuffed in the toy train.

<p><center>*</center>

<p>My Little Lulu cover was no match for TV's Bishop Sheen, he of the handsome, gaunt visage, and haughty jesuitical-talmudic demeanor and tongue. My magic mountain of now collector classic trash disappeared one day, reduced to ashes not fit for any Wednesday forehead by his fanatical glare; my own beloved mother had been the narrow prism's glassy edge. Naturally, I took futile umbrage (A habit I have yet to break.). I liked fear for its own sake, not hitched to any closet anarchist's tight little red wagon! To quake without reason or purpose was one of the great joys of my young life. The greatest? A Classics Illustrated toss-up: The Red Badge Of Courage or All Quiet On The Western Front.
<p>Despite such an immense cultural setback, I marched on over blacktop roads so hot they bubbled. The war surplus jerry can I filled with water to approximate imagined authentic weight and strapped on my puny back grew heavy, but I marched on. The ersatz shoulder straps cut into my thin white shoulder blades, but I was not delivering newspapers for material profit, so I marched on, a self-posted guard for all that was worth my ardent young life, my total sacrifice. All summer day I'd march back and forth, defending what was not there. Other children would come and go, gawking about my sweaty periphery, the girls crazed with blue bells and cockle shells, trailing frayed wood-handled jump ropes; the boisterous gaggle of leather-handed boys spraying chalky pink cardboard-tasting bubble gum  shards("value added" to baseball cards--Ahh, capitalism!), but I was always there, "on guard" neath my authentic WWII steel helmet. 
<p>Eventually Daddy would be drawn to the window, amazed by this phenomena, which had somehow sprung from his own high school football letter loins: "Hey!" he blared out into the wilderness of upstate New York white birch and cheap pine housing, "You! You out deah! You stoo-pid joik! Hey You! You dopy DennieDimwit! Yule git a stroke! It's 90 degrees out deah! What da heck r yu doin' out deah?"     
<p>But I never answered. I marched on, eyes straight; mouth tight; face paper-white. </strong>

<h4><center>FRAGMENT TWO</center></h4>

<p><strong>Schools of sincere thought defraud their creators. Every abstraction is a vampire. But that is Step, say, Five. At Step One, bare-brained as any lower-middle class cipher (redundant, nicht wahr?), I had no sword and shield worthy of the name, no intellectual filter, no boat to float atop the quasiJungian Sea of Western Lovely Civilization. So I kept my navy blue New York Yankees cap scrunched on, night and day, the brim worked kool, cupping my breathless choking wonder as Daddy, doing his best to be the male bacon man, dumped us all (5 kids)into the used black DeSoto hearse with the plaid extra seats, which sped toward the Heartland (O-hi-O ugliest flag in the land). 

<p><center>*</center>

<p>The new public grade school playground had the usual gun gray monkey bars and merry-go-round; the usual male pattern bald baseball field. I trailed my lonely holy sneaker toe alone in the dirt path around the creaky merry-go-round, as they chose up team sides via the textbook LILP (LastInLastPicked) method of inventory just as if Rousseau had never existed. After school I idled some time away tieing cherry bombs to the tail base of stray cats--they could really go! I then wrote about it in the grade school newspaper, taking the third person to mount contemplative essays, such as: Why Do We Do Mean Things? I graduated Sixth Grade with honors. 

<center>*</center>

<p>For Seventh Grade, I found myself amid marching, wooden soul art on the walls. The only flutter arose upon the pounce of a black nun's habit, lyrics by snappy fingered metal froggie clicker, impatient at choir tomfoolery. The paradigm: Holy Communion every day (no jacking off). Breakfast afterward: Ecumenical heirarchy:<UL>(microeconomic base: chocolate milk@5 cents; white milk@4 cents; roll@5 cents): 
<LI>1 carton (1/4 pint) chocolate milk + 3 icing rolls=Wealthy as a King
<LI>1 carton chocolate milk + 2 icing rolls=Wealthy as a Prince 
<LI>1 carton chocolate milk + 1 icing roll =Wealthy 
<LI(Of course, e.g.,)1 carton white milk + 2 rolls beats Wealthy, etc. 
<LI>(CF: MY usual (clean soul and all): 1 carton white milk </UL>  

<p>Relational Psyche summa: If you crossed the street and got hit by a car before you got to confession, a precondition to getting your milk & rolls delineated above, you would roast on a (crotchety rough iron) spit (stuck like a pig from asshole to mouthhole) in HELL forever, under the extremely unimaginative eye of the Devil's Food can label devil. Once you got to confession: Out blurt the standard for a million stand-up routines. Yet I was not immune to the Paglian mythos of High Catholic magic: It was not for other that I volunteered to try out for altar boy--unless you throw in the fact Daddy presented it as a challenge: "I bet ya can't loin Latin!"
<p>I did. AmoAmasAmat--I was awarded a small stick pin. A tacky bit of cheap powder blue and gold paint, this miniscule medal did not stop me from peeking in at obese and aged Monsigneur O'Reilly while he switched a la the boy wonder into his sacred black and red-lined robes. Stumbling upon this mighty hairy morphing one day, I suffered a jarring, ineffable revelation akin to Saul's on the road to Damascus.

<p>Whatever I experienced at that moment of impulsive voyeurism I nevertheless remained with the church cadre for a brief time, a time awash in further revelation once I flipped the glaring white Holy Communion linen over the altar rail: The humans came to me in generations, single file, walking slow, heads bowed; they knelt down before me, eyes closed, thrusting forth their wet and private tongues to receive the wafer symbolizing the body of Jesus Christ. I felt horror, a vague giddy horror brushing its dull head up inside me as softly and quietly as Monsigneur O'Reilly's vestment hem brushed the lush crimson and gold-bordered altar carpet. My own family's pious tongues were indistinguishable from the others. Washing the cruets after High Mass, I tasted the wine, which was like medicine--almost as bad as the host wafers that tasted like milky cardboard. After the final altar boy chores were done, I'd strip off my power, hang them up in the scented closet behind the altar, and dash out into
the street, just another playful white warrior.

<center>*</center>

<p>Without cassock rights I would never have become such close friends with Carl Bekker, a fellow utterer of Latin code. Carl was my kind of kid. Once won, his honor was his loyalty. He was always there to steady the heavy blank newspaper roll, a gift in appreciation of my reliability from Mister Doyle, the man who had dropped of my newspapers each day. With Carl's steadfast help I could rip off a sheet vast enough for my epic battle drawings. I needed the whole boys bedroom floor to lay out the working sheet. Carl admired the developing battle from his perch atop Spike's upper bunk. Carl was as appalled as I every time Daddy, totally ignoring my closed door, burst in cradling his football and crushing fifty Hessians with every manly step over Bunker Hill. It always amazed me how Daddy was so sure doors were for opening, floors, for walking, and--why, even Carl had learned the real function of newspaper!

<center>*</center>

<p>One day I gave the loyal Carl, a technology freak, a hectic giant drawing gloriously depicting in florid crashing flash and minute detail the flower of French chivalry being slaughtered by rows of English longbows at Crecy. When he came to me the next day, still overwhelmed by my creation and generosity,  I offered yet another freebee. To get it, all Carl had to do was follow me along the cardboard scraps leading to the promised land, to Daddy's little backyard.

<p>When we got there I even helped Carl put his second gift on. Yes, said I, the belts will hold, the cardboard is a very sturdy kind, yes, yes, even the vizor actually works! No, the sword is not too sharp! Worrywart! What's mine, is yours! Taking Carl's cautionary braying as mere etiquette, I swiftly donned the second suit of armor I had crafted. Garbage can lid in one hand, wood sword in the other, we faced off. I warned him not to cheat. "I know, I know, you told me a thousand times!" he whined. "Churl!" I hurled, and I attacked
the ignoble ingrate forwith. A fierce battle ensued. Slowly I gained mastery due to the more powerful image concepts careening about the inside rim of my high forehead. I was about to deliver the winning blow--I had whacked Carl's vizor so hard it was dangling like an earring on a wuss, exposing his wide eyes--when Daddy appeared as deus ex machina: "Hey! Watruse2doin? Say! Aint U da leedle altah boy wit'alladem sistehs?"

<p>Carl: "Yessir."

<p>Daddy: "YeahIdautso--say, Wats Ur Ol Man do fer alivin?"

<p>Carl: "He builds houses--he's a carpenter."

<p>Daddy: "Yeah? Ya kno da Son O God wuz a cahpenteh, hah, hah? Bekkeh, huh? Joyman, eh? Figues...dem cahpentehs make purdy good moola, eh? Coas dey got duh unions behind em! Unions r as bad as management! Deys all out ta featha their nest at yur expense! Nobody keres bout da leedle guy, ya know? Da Haves versus Da Havenots! Dats da toon! U guys will loin some day--say, wanna heah bout da knights of Old? Heh-heh, listen ta dis, N yus ken put it inna pot wit wat I jess told ya: 
<center>In days of old, wan knights wuz bold,</center>
<center>N terlits weren't invented--</center>
<center>Dey laid a load inna middle O da Road--</center>
<center>N walked away contented!"</center>

<p>I: "Oh Dad!"

<p>Daddy: "Hee-hee!Purdy good, eh?"

<P>I: "God!"  

<p>Daddy: "BRAAACK! Deah's a Bronx cheah for yez! Don't hoit yerselfs now. Yer muddeh's worried and she ain't so hot lately--she's spitting up blood ya know. Carl, ya bettah watch dis kid of mine--he gits carried away n don't kn o when to stop! Dinks he's Sir Lancelot! He tilts at windmills, if ya git me drift!"  

<center>*</center>

<p>A week later I presented Carl with a third original gift, my crossbow. It took an inordinate quantum of child's will power to push up the bent nail trigger, thereby releasing the steel bow (undercarriage leaf spring), hence the bolt (child's wagon axle sharpened to a point at the target end). Upon demonstration, I sent the bolt through a hay bale. Unfortunately, it continued on into a neighbor's car door. Carl really appreciated such power. Crossbows were illegal in Ohio. At last he spoke the magic words: "Wanna come over to my house and play guns?" said he. "But you have to be quiet or the neighbors will complain to my parents when they come home from work! Nobody is allowed over during the day! And, you will just have to put up with my sisters! OK?"
<p> "Yup," I nodded solemnly, my heart slapping up wildly against my brain. Terri, the middle sister, being in my own grade, was the proper object. But she was sullen and sans curves, though she drooped like the mop my mother stood out on the back stoop to dry. I hoped for Tori, who was high and mighty, fully developed, and now an actual grade school graduate going to high school in the fall! I strongly suspected Tori had already been perky and sly with big hombres up there--she was destined to be a freshie cheerleader. Tina, the youngest, was only a sixth-grader, but she was a daring, bubbly and big-toothed tom-boy with vibrant long legs. All the Bekker girls had flaxen hair. 
<center>*</center>
<p>So it came to pass that I, a Remarque private defending the Fatherland yet unaware that the war was over, dashed into Carl's ranch-style tract house to avoid the crush of the overwhelmingly superior enemy forces and material. They were all fresh and fit. I was on my last legs. It was there and then, my throat parched and my short life nearing its tragic end, when I spotted those torrid and tony, long and (at the moment)languorous, calf-flexing legs Love yearned to mount.</P>
<p>Tori was flexing her tanned symmetry, the familiar blue-covered Baltimore Catachism idle below the gray sweatshirt's border, balanced on the mound. What a mound! The frayed corderoy ribbing of Tori's faded yellow microshorts seemed balding by the second from pure packed puffy puckered PUSSY tension. Mesmerized, I went my way like a sleepwalker, shedding my gear. She pretended not to notice, then shock--at the mere clatter of my authentic Austrian M-16 trench helmet. I, I was forced to enter! I, I was the one who laid out the white sheets so she could talk to, eat GOD! I knew the Latin hex! I, yes, I even knew the answers to the long-winded tricky questions in her catachism companion, the tome, The Question Box, written for all those mature High School students! Of course she was IN CHARGE, absent her parents! All of that fire power just to get to the edge of Tori's bed. Then, upside Tori's thigh... </P>
<P> On the bed's edge Tori's golden thigh flesh remained pressed to my field gray so that the stilted and loaded scholastic questions she thrust at me began to swim in page upon page of badly drawn biblical parables--and then a hot silence ensued. To break this unbearable silence and show the cat had not my tongue, as Tori so accused ("I Accuse!"), I dove straight to THE MOUND. There I chisled in with my chin. </P>    

<P>Moments passed. My neck nape ached. I strained my eyeballs up over the wet corderoy trench; saw the smooth underbelly of Tori's chin; the slack moistness of her lips. Her dovetailed hair feathers pranced aruptly upon a svelte shudder. She moaned. I slithered up over the top of NOMAN'S LAND, gasping for air, for courage. I landed squarely on a dainty pink ear. I breathed and moaned low; Tori's lips found mine. </P>
<p>Above us the Sacred Heart Of Jesus looked down, glossy, perfectly-proportioned, now HIS heart had STYLE! It boasted a ruby red as rich as Mickey Mouse's shorts! Certainly it was in a different league than those puke-colored, splotchy, and irregularly proportioned organs lurking back home in the family medical dictionary. Actually, although it seemed as impossible as ignoring a woody during the Pledge Of Allegiance, HE was ignoring his heart--he was pointing up, up somewhere beyond the frame. I craned my neck to the max, but all I saw was a dried palm stalk leftover from some Easter past. It was stuck behind the picture frame. Above that I saw nothing, so I dropped my head down. </P>
<P>We clacked together. Quickly I repenetrated the enamel barrier. It gave way easily. Tori was no Diane, nor even a Colleen. I soared like an F-86 Sabre jet over MIG Alley, cracking social, aesthetic and sundry barriers simultaneously. All systems were GO when we heard the dry suburban whine of an aluminum screen door, which was quickly drowned out by the moronic schreech of a bored sniper. "Hey! U in here? You know this house is OUTOBOUNDS! Talk about cheaters! I got four shots with your name on 'em!"</p>
<p>"Shhh! It's my brother--he's at the back door, the kitchen! Git OFF me, you OAF! Altar boy, umph! It's a mortal sin-OFF!"</P
<p>"Ahhhh-ha, aaah-haaaaa--jess a sec--" I managed, her hot sexy knee boning my soft uberbelly </P
<p>"HURRY! Or I'll tell my boyfriend--he's SIXTEEN ya know!"</p>
<p>Now that threat was no effeminate abstraction stuck with yellowing sickly palm shards, I instantly realized, and, ejected straight up in the suburban air by this hulking realization, the F-86 Sabre jetted away to the vast halls of the Bekker residence, bounced around off the walls, and landed on the expanse of faux marble hex kitchen tiles, just in time to be blasted by the lever action of Carl's Red Ryder BB-gun.</P>
<p>Carl beamed down at my twitching leg. "That's all she wrote, chump! War's over! Come on! I'll show you my hiding place--you never had a chance!"</p>  
<p>I yearned to inform the ignorant shmuck he had fired not 4, but 40 shots, but I was dead.</p>
