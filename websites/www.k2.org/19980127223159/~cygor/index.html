<A NAME="misc"><HR><CENTER><H2>=-=-=-=- Miscellaneous Questions -=-=-=-=</H2></CENTER></A><HR><BR>

<A NAME="misc1"><H4>What is an Interrupt Move?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Interrupt moves are shadowed moves that are done immediately after blocking 
the first part of an attack.  Not all moves are interrupt moves.  Each
character has different ones.  For example: If I am playing Sawada, and
someone jumps in with a kick as soon as I think I blocked the tip of the
kick, I can do a forward kick, and get a green slide kick move.  This move
works as a charge back..(which you did while blocking)forward.  This move 
cannot be used at any other time except after blocking.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc2"><H4>Where can I get this FAQ as well as updates?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Please do NOT write me requesting the FAQ.  We get enough mail as it is with
people giving me combos, and new moves without a bunch of 'Can you send me'
stuff.  The FAQ will be available by FTP from ftp.netcom.com in the
/PUB/VI/VIDGAMES/FAQS directory.  This site has been set up by Andy Eddy from
GamePro Magazine.  Thanks as always Andy!<P>

Also available at: ftp://brawl.mindlink.net.pub/sftm<P>

Other Sites will be available soon.  If you have a FTP site or WEB page and
you would like to include it, please let me know so we can add your site here!
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc3"><H4>Why are John and Brian writing this FAQ?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
This FAQ is being written by us because we have been playtesting the game for
a while, and not only know most of the moves, but are trying to get others to
see how great of a game this really is.  Hopefully by reading this FAQ people
will give SFTM a chance, and play a few games before judging it.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc4"><H4>What is a Comeback Move?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Comeback Moves are special moves that can only be done when your player's
health meter is in the Danger zone.  They may include new projectiles,
different kicks, etc.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc5"><H4>What is a Super Move?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Super Moves are special moves that can only be executed when your SUPER BAR is
filled.  These moves usually result in a series of special moves leading to a
combo.  They can be added to the end of normal combos, or precede it. 
All characters have at least 2 Super Moves.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc6"><H4>How do I fill my Super Bar?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Your Super Bar is filled by performing Special Moves.  Whether you hit the
opponent or not, every time you do a Special Move your Super Bar fills a
little more.  Honda and Chun Li can fill their bars VERY quickly.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc7"><H4>Why am I dizzy?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Each character has a dizzy counter (that you cannot see) that goes down with
every hit, and regenerates back up as long as you are not being hit.  Hits to
the head area make the dizzy counter drop faster than hits to other areas of
the body.  If your dizzy counter drops all the way to zero your character goes
into a dizzy state, leaving you open for a combo from your opponent.
Some dizzy's last longer than others.  There are STAR and BIRD dizzys.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc8"><H4>What's up with these throws and counters?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Every player has at least 2 ways to throw (some have 3).  Throws are usually
executed  by pushing the joystick towards or away, and pressing a button.
Throws can be Countered!  To counter a throw, you must know your OPPONENT'S
counter move.  So if you are fighting against Ryu, you must know RYU'S counter
move.  The person who initiates the throw is taking the biggest risk against a
good player, because as you throw, the opponent counters.  You do a reversal,
but your opponent can SLAMMASTER you!  Counter throws and reversals involve
the same button with the joystick up, while Slammasters involve a different
button with the joystick down.  Also there are throws which will throw the
opponent clear across the screen.  Use this when you're stuck in a corner and
just want the opponent out of your face.  It does little damage but provides
you with an opportunity to gain some breathing room.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc9"><H4>How does the point system work?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Who cares.. it's a fighting game!  Who ever is the least damaged wins!
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc10"><H4>Why does my big multi-hit combo not do that much damage?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Because someone was thinking over at Capcom/Incredible Technologies!  Unlike
some of those other fighting games, big combos are there for fun and not to
completely destroy your opponent with 2 combos.  Combo damage is done with the
formula  1, 1/2^(N-1), where N = number of hits.
For example the 1st hit in a combo does 1/1 damage (full damage), the 2nd hit
does 1/2 normal damage, the 3rd does 1/4, and the 4th does 1/8.. etc.  If you
are seriously trying to win, and not just have a good time playing, big
multi hit combos are not what you want to be wasting your time with.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc11"><H4>What moves are in this new version?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
99% of the original Street Fighter moves are in this version along with tons of 
new moves and Supers!
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc12"><H4>What moves are not in this new version?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Zangeif's Bear Rush, and Guile's Shoulder Slam Rush.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc13"><H4>What's up with the characters?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
There are 14 selectable characters from the select screen.  We know that there
were 21 characters digitized, and at least 3 of those are hidden and playable.
Blanka IS one of them!  All characters were digitized in Australia during the
filming of Street Fighter the Movie.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc14"><H4>What's up with the stages?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
All the stages are backgrounds that were seen in the movie.  There are 7
stages that normally come up during game play and at least 5 hidden stages!
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc15"><H4>What about bugs and new info?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
If you have found a bug or typo please let me know.  If you find any new moves
or information please send it to me along with your full name and E-mail
address and you will receive credit in the next version of the FAQ.  Some info
is being withheld (we can't give ALL the moves away) but whatever is told to
me by someone else, we CAN and will include.<P>
So send that info to floyd@ripco.com  Also any friendly criticism. =-)
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc16"><H4>Where did the Actor and Character info come from?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
The actor and character info was obtained from the SFTM trading cards. These
are 'baseball' style cards with shots from the movie and info on the back.
Most of the actor info seems to be exaggerated just to make the actors look
good.  The actors are almost always the same height as the character and weigh
less.<P> 

I.E. Van Damme is about 5' 8&quot but they say he is taller to make him more like Guile.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc17"><H4>What the heck is a ReGen move?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Re-Gen moves give you some health back. They are done by charging 2 buttons
then releasing, only when you have your SUPER BAR charged. This will pour your
Super Power into your Energy Bar.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc18"><H4>Anything else I should know about this FAQ?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Yes, it's not done!  There are still plenty of moves and secrets to be found!
Also we will be changing the format (Hopefully for the better) as we go along so 
please bear with us.  Thank you.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc19"><H4>Who is the guy playing Blade?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Blade is played by Alan Noon.<P>
He is one of the artists from Incredible Technologies.
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc20"><H4>What's up with the SFTM Brochure hand out?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
Well, in the middle section there is a picture of the tag-team VS screen with
free play.  Free play is NOT a hidden code.  That is just an option in the
operator controls.  It's used during testing so you don't have to keep
pretending to insert coins into the machine to play.<P>

In the picture on the righthand side (the dungeon picture with Cammy VS Guile) 
Cammy also appears chained up.  That has been fixed, so that whoever is
fighting does NOT have a twin also chained up.<P>

One of the hidden characters is pictured in the bottom right hand corner
fighting Honda on the Command Center level.  Hmm, what's that name?
</H4><P>


<A NAME="misc21"><H4>What are the abbreviations for the Joystick and buttons?</H4></A><P>
<H4>
All moves shown are from position facing the other player.  So Forward means 
towards the opponent.  Example if you're on the left side and opponent is on
the right.

Considered one of the best street fighters ever, Ryu has been taught the ways 
of Shotokan karate by his foster father, Sensei Gouken.  What Ryu lacks in 
physical stature, he surpasses with his inner-mental strength.  He is not the
polished con-man his friend Ken is, but he is considered a master street 
fighter.  Ryu has won a World Championship crown from Shadaloo Tong Kingpin,
Sagat some years ago.  Sagat seeks revenge even to this day.

The right hand man for Shadall Tong Kingpin, Sagat, Vega will do anything for
money.  The only stipulation is that no harm comes to his face.  When Sagat
needs an exterminator, Vega will gleefully accept.  He is nicknamed the
'Spanish Ninja' due to his blend of matador techniques with his Ninjitsu
training.  Since Vega only fights to the death, everyone knows he is
undefeated in all street fighter competition, and is still awaiting the
perfect opponent.

With an on-again/off-again military career, William Guile returned to the rank
of Colonel in order to exact his revenge on General M. Bison for killing his 
best friend Charlie.  As the leader of the Allied Nations forces, it is up to 
Guile to rescue the 63 hostages being held in the deepest regions of Shadaloo 
Fortress.  It is Guile's opinion that it will take a one-on-one confrontation 
in order to end the rule of Bison.

Viktor Sagat was once the 'King of the Street Fighters.'  Now the master of
Muai Thai, the deadliest  form of kick boxing, is merely the kingpin of the
Shadaloo Tong.  He lost his crown to Ryu Hoshi after being knocked out in the 
championship match.  Sagat has fuzzy memories of that night and knows only
that he will avenge his loss and wants Ryu either dead or alive.

Brash, arrogant and in need of discipline, Ken was sent by his father to live
and learn under martial arts master, Sensei Gouken.  Learning everything he
could about the 2,000 year old Shotokan Karate, Ken left the dojo and entered
the world as a con-artist and rogue.  Always by his side, Ryu Hoshi is the
foster-son of Gouken and watches out for his lifelong friend, trying to point
Ken to follow the path of good, not evil.

Over the years M. Bison had his top scientist create the ultimate fighting
warrior.  Their goal was similar to Dhalsim's DNA ideas.  Many genetic
experiments had taken place with nothing gained.  Finally a master in robotics
had designed a robot with abilities similar to the desired abilities of the
experiments.  His Electric charge comes from his master (Bison) and mechanical
arms and legs from the stolen ideas of Dhalsim. 

To play against Arkane: 1) Be on Bison's Lair Stage
                        2) Watch for Blade to walk across doorway in back

**** What Do all these Modes do? ****

+ Random Select:  Does just that, it randomly selects a character for you to
play.  Once people start to get familiar with the characters this will
probably become the normal way of play.

+ Hide Strength Meters:  Hides your strength meter so that you have no idea
how much energy you have left.  You still get your Super bar.  This mode can
be dangerous when you get it in random mode because you may have also been
handicapped with Double Damage and not know it.

+ Invisi Tag:  This allows one player at a time to be invisible.  Whichever
player made the last hit will be invisible until he is touched.

+ No Throws:  This mode makes it so that you cannot throw your opponent. 
Since there are ways to escape and counter throw, this mode is not valued 
as much as a game with no way of escape.

+ No Special Moves:  This mode makes the game simple.  All moves are limited
to only your simple kicks and punches.

+ No Standard Moves:  All moves are limited to Special Moves.  No regular
kicks or punches.

+ Tag Team mode:  Allows you to pick 2 characters to fight with. One will
fight your first round and the other will fight your second round.  This is a
great mode to start to learn the other characters with.  Just pick your
stronger character second.

+ Double Damage Mode:  Your character takes double the normal damage with
every hit. (OUCH!)

+ Turbo Mode:  The game play seems a little faster because your characters
fall faster.

+ Slow Mode:  This will be a favorite of DieHard SF fans.  All moves slow down
while combos are being done.

+ No Blocking Mode:  This mode makes for an exciting, and quick match. 
You cannot block any moves.  Although your character goes into a blocking 
position, you will still get hit.

+ Combo Mode:  This mode allows for higher combos because your opponent does
not fall as far away as he normally would in a regular match allowing to get
in a few extra hits. 

+ No Kick Buttons:  Your kick buttons are disabled.  All you can use is punch.

+ No Punch Buttons: Your punch buttons are disabled.  All you can use is kick.

+ Upside Down Mode:  The entire screen is flipped upside down and backwards. 

+ Wacky Controls:  The screen stays the same, but all joystick movements are
now upsidedown and backwards.

+ Swap Fighter and Moves:  This mode is great for all those TRUE trash talker
players.  This mode allows your OPPONENT to pick the character and modes
YOU will fight with.  If you think you can play the game with the big boys go
for it!

+ Random Mode Select:  This select is very fun.  It randomly selects several 
of the above modes so when the round starts you have to try and figure out
what you can, and can't use to beat your opponent.

There are a few more mode selects we don't have in here.  They WILL be in the 
next version of the FAQ.
