<P>The first thing you need to do is create HTML pages for the default
server response you wish to replace. Place this document in the dir 
~/public_html as you would any other page.
(or ~/vhost_mycompany.com/http-docs/ if you are a CompleteAct customer; where mycompany.com is your domain name.)</P>
<P>For this example, we wish to replace the "404 Not Found" error
message, and have named our HTML document (that will be displayed insted
of that message) <I>not_there.html</I>.</P>

<P>Now we must create a file called <I>.htaccess</I> in your html dir as
well. In it we must tell the server what error responses we wish to
replace.(If you already have an .htaccess file, simply add this
information to it.)<P>

<P>The syntax for the entry is:</P>
<P><font color="#900000">ErrorDocument [Error Number] [Page To Display Insted of Default Response]</font></P>
<P>So since we wish to replace 404 Not Found error message, and we want it
to display the file not_there.html, we would put (Where username is
your login ID.):</P>
<P><font color="#900000">ErrorDocument 404 http://www.enteract.com/~username/not_there.html</font></P>
<P>If you are a CompleteAct customer, you would put (Where
mycompany.com is your domain name):</P>
<P><font color="#900000">ErrorDocument 404 http://www.mycompany.com/not_there.html</font></P>
