PBEM&nbsp;Game Center</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Welcome to the Champions Play By Email Game Center. You
are invited to play the hero or villain <I>of your design</I> in monthly
tournaments against other champions from around the world. Competitions
include fights, races, and contests of skill and power in arenas ranging
from dungeon labyrinths to crowded office buildings. Turns are gamemastered
on a <I>daily</I> basis and exciting news reports are broadcast each week!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Please take a few minutes to read the rules below. Next
week I'll start taking applications for the first game, and in two weeks,
the first tournament will begin!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Games are <I>free</I> for all participants.</FONT></P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>THE RULES:</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>I. General</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A. A new tournament will be announced every four weeks.</P>

<P>B. Tournaments will be posted with the following information.</P>

<UL>
<P>1. The tournament title.</P>

<P>2. The rulesystem being used (Champions, Ninja Hero, Fantasy Hero, etc.).</P>

<P>3. Character build points (base plus disadvantages).</P>

<P>4. Specific character requirements (usually rulesystem-specific).</P>

<P>5. The maximum number of players allowed for the tournament.</P>

<P>6. Deadlines for character submissions.</P>

<P>7. Start date for the tournament.</P>

<P>8. Any additional information.</P>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>II. Game Layout</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A. Each tournament will consist of a pre-generated map of varying terrain.
Characters will be magically teleported to various spots. Maps could be
underground labyrinths, skyscrapers, railroad cars, demonic temples, space
stations, or even underwater cities. You will not be told in advance where
you will be going; therefore, it would behoove you to build a well-rounded
character.</P>

<P>B. There will usually be extra creatures, hazards, and encounters in
addition to the other characters in the tournament. One particularly nasty
creature you'll run into is the TV News Reporter. Reporters will sometimes
get in your way and pester you in the middle of combat. They will also
report everything they see in the weekly news. You can attack or kill reporters
if you like, but you may quickly develop a reputation. Likewise, heroes
that save reporters will often get good press.</P>

<P>C. If your character turns out to be totally incapable of handling the
environment, the Sidekick Recruitment Agency might step in and give you
a small gadget to help you along. In return, the SRA will proudly feature
you in one of their future commercials.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>III. Character Creation</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A. You may make any character you like within the points specified and
within the rules of both the system being used and the rules given here.
Be sure to include all of the following:</P>

<UL>
<P>1. Your character's limitations, characteristics, talents, skills, powers,
and point totals.</P>

<P>2. A physical description of your character. This description will be
used when other characters see you. Please also state what sounds your
character makes (electrical noises, animal sounds, or unusual accents when
speaking), how impressive he or she looks (flame auras, hovering, and the
like) and any other distinguishing features. <I>Pictures</I> are great
if you can send them! Good quality pictures often end up in the news and
bring lots of fame to your character!</P>

<P>3. A cinematic description of your character's powers. Be sure to explain
what form (lightning bolt, fireball, laser blast), color, accompanying
battle scream (&quot;THUNDER CLAW!!!&quot;), and other features your powers
have.</P>

<P>4. A short (a paragraph or so) origin for your character. This does
not need to be very long, but I&nbsp;would like to know how your character
got his or her powers. Your character can come from virtually any world.
For examples, refer to the sample characters in the Champions rulebook.</P>

<P>5. A paragraph or so describing your character's general personality.</P>

<P>6. A paragraph or so describing your character's general tactics.</P>

<P>7. <I>Your default action if attacked. </I>See section V., Game Play.
Defense is automatic in this game. You need to tell me how your character
would defend if attacked. You can specify that you would abort an action
to defend (please specify which defensive action you would use), or you
could just rely on your DCV. Your character will use this action when attacked.
Under most circumstances, you can't specify different defensive actions
for different attacks unless you have a really good reason.</P>
</UL>

<P>B. Do not create illegal or questionable powers. The game master will
err on the side of &quot;I don't think so.&quot; in such cases. Read the
rules. If the book has a stop sign or a magnifying glass next to it, be
careful and be reasonable. No characteristics in ECs, no non-limiting limitations,
etc. You know the drill.</P>

<P>C. If there are more players than the number of spaces allowed in the
game, preference will be given to:</P>

<UL>
<P>1. Characters that are the most legal.</P>

<P>2. Characters with clearly defined powers. (Characters that are easy
to understand.)</P>

<P>3. Characters that are cinematically exciting, make a good story, and
make sense.</P>
</UL>

<P>D. RESTRICTED&nbsp;CHARACTER&nbsp;DISADVANTAGES. The following character
disadvantages are not allowed in this game:</P>

<UL>
<P>1. Dependence with greater than a turn before taking damage (segment,
phase, and turn are ok).</P>

<P>2. Dependent NPC.</P>

<P>3. Hunted and Watched.</P>
</UL>

<P>D. RESTRICTED POWERS. The following powers are not allowed in this game:</P>

<UL>
<P>1. Extra-dimensional movement.</P>

<P>2. Faster-than-light travel.</P>

<P>3. Summon.</P>
</UL>

<P>E. RESTRICTED POWER&nbsp;ADVANTAGES. The following power advantages
are not allowed in this game:</P>

<UL>
<P>1. Indirect.</P>
</UL>

<P>F. RESTRICTED POWER&nbsp;LIMITATIONS. The following power limitations
are not allowed in this game:</P>

<UL>
<P>1. Independent.</P>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>IV. Registration</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>To register, send a typed copy of your character to me at kirin@enteract.com
by the deadline. Be sure to include the following:</P>

<UL>
<P>A. The title and deadline of the tournament.</P>

<P>B. Your name.</P>

<P>C. Your email address.</P>

<P>D. Your character.</P>
</UL>

<P>You can submit your character in plain email, ASCII format, Microsoft
Word, or Microsoft Excel as long as it's legible. You will be notified
within 48 hours if your character is approved. You will also be notified
if your character is not approved with reasons why. You may resubmit a
character while time allows.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>V. Game play</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A. Correspondence</P>

<UL>
<P>Each day, you will be sent an email message describing your character's
surroundings and what your character sees, hears, or otherwise senses.
You may then react to your surroundings by emailing me your instructions
for what your character does.</P>

<UL>
<P>1. Your instructions are due by 10:00pm Central Standard Time each day,
Monday through Friday.</P>

<P>2. You will get a response by 3:00pm CST the following weekday (Monday
following Friday).</P>

<P>3. News reports will come out over the weekend.</P>
</UL>

<P>Promptness is checked by the timestamp on your email. If you are late,
your instructions will not count for that day. This could result in your
character standing around like a goof. Deadlines are necessary to keep
the game moving along for everyone.</P>
</UL>

<P>B. Timing</P>

<UL>
<P>Each real-time day equals one segment (second) in the game. You will
be able to act according to your speed as per the Champions rules. Thus,
if you have a speed of 6, you can act every other day. You can also hold
actions by saying so in your email. You cannot act out of turn unless you
normally could do so, such as to abort an action. You can talk all you
like, even on turns you don't move. However, since conversation between
two characters would take place through the GM, you won't get a response
until at least the second after you say something.</P>

<P>An instruction would be something like &quot;I fly toward the speeding
car at top speed.&quot; or &quot;I turn invisible and hold my action.&quot;
You may also ask questions of the GM like &quot;Does it look like she saw
me?&quot; or &quot;What is the box made of?&quot; or &quot;I drank what?&quot;
The more complex or numerous the questions, the more limited your answers
will be.</P>
</UL>

<P>C. Encounters</P>

<UL>
<P><IMG SRC="villain.gif" ALT="Villain picture goes here." HEIGHT=150 WIDTH=119 ALIGN=RIGHT>If you encounter
someone or something, you can act according to your speed. Two characters
encountering one another each have a choice: attack or hope the other character
isn't hostile. You can do anything you like, including talking, running
away, attacking, and so forth. Actions are <I>not</I> based on DEX. If
you can act, you had better act. You must make your decision each segment
that you can. If both characters can act and one attacks but the other
doesn't, only one attack goes off and the defender will defend based upon
his or her default defensive action. If both characters can and do attack,
<I>then</I> the attacks go in order of DEX. In this case, both attacks
do go off (or try to); default defensive actions do not apply. Once an
action is declared for a segment, it cannot be changed.</P>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>VI. Goals and Winning</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The tournament ends when someone wins (completes the goal) or two months
of real time pass.</P>

<P>Your character will become aware of the goal of the scenario at the
very beginning. It may be to retrieve something, be first through a maze
of deathtraps, or simply to defeat all the others in the game. The winner
is either the first person to do this, or, in the case of a tie, the person
that does it best. In a slugfest, a desolid character may stay around a
long time, but the winner will be the one that defeats the most opponents.
Goals are structured so that both good and evil characters can accomplish
them, though disads like &quot;Pacifist&quot; may be a bit too confining
in this game. Mind you, however, that good and evil characters will accomplish
their goals in different ways...</P>

<P>Winning and non-winning characters alike will be hounded by reporters.
You can reveal the secrets of your success if you want to, or you can be
mysterious. Either way, you'll be the center of attention. Smile for the
camera!</P>

<P>Experience points are awarded at the end of each scenario. These are
the only experience points that can be used in future games here and constitute
the only way in which you could have a character with more than the given
build points. Return characters are encouraged! However, though powers
can be added to, they cannot be changed without a full news report on your
radiation accident.</P>
