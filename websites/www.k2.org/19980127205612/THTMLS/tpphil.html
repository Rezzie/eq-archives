<OL>

   <P>Why do we charge the way we do?

   <P><STRONG>It's what we've wanted when we were Internet customers.</STRONG>
   
   <P>If you're surfing heavily its nice to know there won't be a whopper 
   of a bill at the end of the month (<STRONG>between $21 and $30 maximum in our case, depending on how you pay</STRONG>).
   Other months, when you barely check your E-Mail, its painful 
   to pay a high 'flat rate' at the end of the month. <STRONG> Not at EnterAct!</STRONG>

   <P>We feel as though a lot ISPs depend on users signing up for more 
   connectivity than they need, then not using it.
   
   <P><STRONG>We don't think that's right.</STRONG>
   
   <P>Whether you're moving, changing jobs, or just paying too much attention
   to your "real life," our $5 option gives you maximum continuity at 
   the lowest possible price.

   <P>EnterAct pledges to NEVER charge a customer bandwidth or storage 
   charges without first contacting the customer and giving them the 
   option of redesigning/ reducing a web page. This means you can rest 
   assured that you will be charged <STRONG>the lowest possible rates</STRONG> for 
   the resources used, and that you will <STRONG>never be surprised</STRONG> by a 
   larger than expected bill.<BR>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#8c1010">Advance Payment</FONT></STRONG><BR>
<OL>

   <P>We have one of the most generous payment plans possible when it 
   comes to advance payment.  Pay 3 months in advance and we'll give 
   you <STRONG>20% off</STRONG>, pay a year in advance and we'll give you <STRONG>30% off.</STRONG>
   <STRONG>Cancel at any time and we'll give you a prompt, cheerful refund</STRONG>
   for the remaining portion of your subscription (pro-rated to the day you leave!).
<STRONG>This means that for as little as $21 a month</STRONG>, you can get one of Chicagoland's most full-featured internet accounts with unlimited access!

   <P>So you've pre-paid for 30 hours a month -- what if you don't use them all?
<STRONG>You receive a credit in your next billing period for all those unused 
hours!</STRONG>  We think that's simple and fair.

   <P>Why would we do this? <STRONG>Are we crazy?</STRONG> Because most of our
   costs in servicing you are incurred up front. We have our 
   excellent tech support, high-speed rack modems, and other significant
   initial investments. Our architecture scales up easily and 
   relatively cheaply to higher and higher levels of connectivity.
   
   <P>By paying in advance, you match our costs far better, and 
   enable us to give you significant discounts.<BR>
