All of our dedicated lines offer a Usenet news feed at no extra charge.  Many ISPs offer this service, but very few deliver the quality of news feed that EnterAct can. EnterAct has invested heavily in a state of the art, world-class news server.  In addit



ion, EnterAct works tirelessly to keep our news server fast, up-to-date, comprehensive and among the best in the world.</td>

<tr>
<td><a name=redundant><b>Redundant backbone connections</b></a><br>
EnterAct maintains multiple backbone connections, including our T3 connection with one of the Internet's tier 1 providers, BBN Planet.  Not only does this improve reliability, but it can improve 'reachability' - quicker connects - to many sites.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=backbone><b>Backbone-class routing hardware</b></a><br>
All of our T1 to T3 accounts are served directly out of our Cisco 7513 series routers.  There are no cheap 'front-end' routers at EnterAct.   Our ISDN accounts are served on highly regarded Cisco 3640 routers.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=secure><b>Secure network</b></a><br>
We can't say enough about security at EnterAct. We have technical staff that truly understands the daunting task of securing an Internet connected network.  If you would like more information on EnterAct's security offerings, please ask for our security w



hite paper.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=reliable><b>Reliable backup connections</b></a><br>
In the unlikely event your primary Internet connection goes down, EnterAct provides you with an immediate backup line to use temporarily until your primary connection is reestablished.  Our T1 accounts come with emergency ISDN backup included and our ISDN



 accounts always have 'hot spare' ports or an analog line available for use.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=resellable><b>Resellable</b></a><br>
When you purchase a dedicated line from EnterAct you are free to distribute your bandwidth however you see fit (with the exception of doing something which will take down our network or cause any Internet instabilities) including reselling the bandwidth t



o your own customers, effectively, becoming your own ISP!</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=autoalert><b>Autoalert service</b></a><br>
On request, you can have your pager number or email address 'plugged in' to the exact same system EnterAct uses to monitor your line.  This means you will have direct access to our 24 x 7 network monitoring system and you will know immediately if there is



 any disruption of your service!</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=support><b>24 x 7 tailored support</b></a><br>
The day you sign up you will be assigned to a dedicated line specialist.  This person will know you, know the Internet, and know EnterAct.  They can help you accomplish whatever is necessary to make your connection the most effective possible.  Either the



y or their backup is on call 24 hours per day in the event of an emergency.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=unique><b>Unique 'win/win' contract</b></a><br>
Due to the dynamic nature of the Internet, EnterAct realizes a static long-term contract is not always in your best interest.  New technologies or changes in your bandwidth requirements may necessitate an unforeseen change. Therefore, EnterAct has designe



d our longer-term contracts so you are not required to 'payout' the entire length of the contract.  Please ask your salesperson for further details.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=open><b>Open network reports</b></a><br>
Part of EnterAct's philosophy is to give as much information as possible about our network infrastructure and status to our customers. We provide a web site which continually updates you on our router and network status. allowing you to make the most info



rmed purchase decision and let you see that we are not overselling our capacity at any time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=one><b>One stop shop</b></a><br>
All of your Internet connection needs can be met through EnterAct.  In addition to a high quality Internet connection - which you would expect - we can also supply you with the circuit and hardware at the best possible prices.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=optional><b>Optional set up service</b></a><br>
Connecting a LAN to the Internet presents some difficult technical issues - particularly the configuration and on-going maintenance of Internet connection hardware.  EnterAct's optional set up service relieves you of this responsibility by covering the co



nfiguration, on-site installation, and first 30 days of maintenance of your Internet hardware and  connection. EnterAct will bill you separately for the hardware necessary for your connection only after you have approved its' purchase price.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=service><b>Optional managed service</b></a><br>
This service, to be used in conjunction with your optional set up service, relieves you of the responsibility of the on-going management of your Internet connection hardware.  In addition to monitoring your line, we will also monitor your connection hardw



are 24 x 7 and  perform any necessary  remote or on-site maintenance immediately.  While you are still responsible for administering your LAN and all related equipment, this option can eliminate the bulk of your Internet connection management needs.</td>
