<font color=#000000>
<p>
If you telnet or FTP into your account, you can view the directories and files that are set up
within your account.  In your root directory, you will notice three directories:
<p>
<font color=#bb0000>public_ftp </font> <br>
<font color=#bb0000>public_html </font><br>
<font color=#bb0000>vhost_yourdomain.com </font>
<p>

Now, when your account was initially set up, it was set up as a SoloAct account.  Later,
when your domain was either registered or transferred to us, the account was upgraded
to a CompleteAct account.  The first two directories you see here, public_ftp and 
public_html, are left over from that initial SoloAct setup.  The public_ftp directory
is intended as an anonymous FTP area for SoloAct accounts.  The public_html directory
is where SoloAct account holders put their web page documents.  You need not worry about
either of these directories, although if you want to test your web page before making
it live with your domain, you can always stick the pages in the public_html directory and 
access them with <font color=#bb0000>http://www.enteract.com/~username</font>.
<p>
Instead, focus your attention on the vhost_yourdomain.com directory.  If you go
into that directory, you will see four more directories:
<p>
<font color=#bb0000>ftp-root</font><br>        
<font color=#bb0000>http-docs</font><br>       
<font color=#bb0000>http-lib</font><br>        
<font color=#bb0000>http-logs</font>
<p>

</font>
<h3>ftp-root</h3>
<font color=#000000>
With the purchase of a CompleteAct account, you are given an anonymous FTP area.  
Anonymous FTP allows you to make certain
files or programs available to anyone without them having to know
your password to obtain them.  Place any files you would like others
to have access to in the ftp-root directory.  A person can then 
anonymously ftp to <font color=#bb0000>ftp.yourdomain.com</font> to obtain these files.
They should login using <font color=#bb0000>anonymous</font> as their username
and their email address as their password.
</font>
<h3>http-docs</h3>
<font color=#000000>
This directory is where all of your html files go.  You should also put any
image or sound files that you use in your web page here.  If you call your main
page <font color=#bb0000>index.html</font> your URL will be <font color=#bb0000>
www.yourdomain.com</font>.
</font>
<h3>http-lib</h3>
<font color=#000000>
This directory actually has two subdirectories within it.  One is called <font color=#bb0000>
cgi-bin</font> and the other is <font color=#bb0000>cgi-src</font>.<p>
<ul>
<h3>cgi-bin</h3>
Your CGI and Perl scripts should go in this directory.<p>
<h3>cgi-src</h3>
This directory is useful for pre-written scripts
which look for a cgi-src directory.  You may very well not have any use for this directory at all.
</ul>
</font>

<h3>http-logs</h3>
<font color=#000000>
Once you upload your web page and people start looking at it, you will see a file in 
your http-logs directory called <font color=#bb0000>access.log</font>.  This file will
look something like this:
<p>
<font color=#bb0000>
167.142.12.148 - - [13/Mar/1997:03:05:13 -0600] "GET /THTMLS/tFormMail.html HTTP/1.0" 404 -<br>
206.127.6.13 - - [13/Mar/1997:04:25:17 -0600] "GET /ftp.html HTTP/1.0" 404 -<br>
205.212.124.152 - - [13/Mar/1997:08:45:22 -0600] "GET /ftp.html HTTP/1.0" 404 -<br>
194.73.232.29 - - [13/Mar/1997:09:06:44 -0600] "GET /start.html HTTP/1.0" 404 -
</font>
<p>
This file is a log of your web page hits.  Reading from left to right, it shows
the IP address of the machine that accesses your page, the date and time when your
page was accessed, and the file that was accessed from your site.
<p>
<ul>
<h3>.roll</h3>
As you get more and more hits, the access.log file will become a long and unruly mess.  You want
a way to break it up over the span of a day, week, or month.   To do this, create
a file in your http-logs directory called <font color=#bb0000>.roll</font>.  In this file,
you need only put the word <font color=#bb0000>daily</font>, <font color=#bb0000>weekly</font>,
or <font color=#bb0000>monthly</font>.  Once you do this, you will start seeing additional
logs appear in your directory.  If you have your logs roll dailly, for example, the files
in your http-logs directory might look something like this:
<p>
<font color=#bb0000>
access.log <br>             
access.log.3-2-97<br>       
access.log.3-3-97 <br>
access.log.3-4-97 <br>
access.log.3-5-97 <br>
www-stats-3-2-97.html<br>
www-stats-3-3-97.html<br>
www-stats-3-4-97.html<br>
www-stats-3-5-97.html<br>
</font>
<p>

You can see that now, instead of having just one access.log file, there are many; one for
each day.  So, if you just wanted to see how many hits you had on a certain day, week,
or month, you don't have to sift through a huge file in order to do this.  You can simply look at
the log for whatever day, week, or month you are interested in.  
<p>
Now, you'll also notice that there are corresponding html files in this directory too.  These
show more detailed graphical statistics about your web page hits.  Because the permissions
are not set for everyone to be able to see these documents by default, you will need to move the html
files to your http-docs directory in order to view them.  Issue the following command at your UNIX
prompt to do this: 
<p>
<font color=#bb0000>
mv *.html ~username/vhost_yourdomain.com/http-docs
</font>
<p>
At this point, you can go to your web browser and put in the following URL:
<p>
<font color=#bb0000>http://www.yourdomain.com/www-stats-3-2-97.html</font>
<p>
Of course yours will be named something slightly different depending on the date
of your log, but you get the idea.
