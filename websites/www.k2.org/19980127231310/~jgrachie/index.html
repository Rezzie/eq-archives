<P>You cybernaut, you. You made it on the internet and found our page, congratulations!
Now if we can only tap into Bill Gates bank account on this darn thing we'll
be all set.</P>

<P>As you can see, and as <A HREF="mailto:sharms67@hotmail.com">Seth Harms</A>
commented, I have too much time on my hands. Boomhauer from &quot;King of
the Hill&quot; <A HREF="boom009.wav">explains it this way.</A> The internet,
e-mail, faxing, modems -- boy, I remember a time when I used to drive 20
miles to work, and in deep snow, too.</P>

<P>Okay, for those of you unfamiliar with the internet -- you can double-click
on the underlined, red words (called links). These links will:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="java.jpg">take you to pictures</A>,
  <LI><A HREF="photos.html">take you to other web pages</A>,
  <LI>bring up <A HREF="mailto:jgrachie@enteract.com">e-mail</A> forms to
  specific people, or
  <LI><A HREF="boo_man.wav">play a sound file</A>
</UL>

<P>Also, any picture with a red box around it is also considered a link,
so click on the pictures, too. Double-click, Mom. To get back to this page
after a link takes you to another page or picture, hit the &quot;Back&quot;
button on your browser window.</P>

<P><A HREF="newyork.html"><IMG SRC="liberty.gif" WIDTH="79" HEIGHT="137"
ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Click Here to See New York Pictures"></A>In
the January, Krista surprised me for my thirtieth birthday by flying us
out to <A HREF="newyork.html">New York</A>. We saw <A HREF="shows.html">&quot;Rent&quot;
and &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.&quot;</A> We dined
out at &quot;The Tavern of the Green,&quot; watched the &quot;Today&quot;
show from the windows, went to Central Park, saw the Statue of Liberty,
and gave all our money away to bellhops, cabbies, waiters, and coat checks.</P>

<P><A HREF="java.html"><IMG SRC="java/snifsmal.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT=
"107" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Click Here to See Pictures of Java"></A>This
spring we welcomed a new member to our family -- <A HREF="java.html">Java</A>.
Java is an <A HREF="http://www.adognet.com/breeds/a/ashe01.htm">Australian
Sheppard</A> mix. We got her from Orphans of the Storm, a local pet shelter.
By pure coincidence, one of the guys I work with, <A HREF="http://www.enteract.com/~jrichey">Jim
Richey</A>, bought her sister, <A HREF="http://www.enteract.com/~jrichey/newpic.htm">Brandy</A>.</P>

<P>Java has consumed much of our lives. She wakes us up in the middle of
the night to go outside, I run her around the neighborhood in the morning,
Krista takes her on walks during her lunch hour, and she drinks out of the
toilet at night. It's like having a child -- except for the toilet water
part.</P>

<P>This spring also allowed us some time to work on the <A HREF="home.html">house</A>.We
planted a garden with tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, pumpkins, and garlic.
We even attempted canning our own homemade tomato sauce. I thought it tasted
great, but Krista was still skeptical of the canning process. Who needs
to fear Sadam Hussein and his biological weapons when I have my own &quot;Bochalism
in a Jar?&quot; It's the mother of all jars -- ah, topical humor.</P>

<P><A HREF="family.gif"><IMG SRC="fam2.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="126" ALIGN=
"RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Mother's Day" BORDER="0"></A>We celebrated
Mother's Day at the Chicago Botanical Gardens. <A HREF="mailto:ArleneRach@aol.com">Mom</A>
is doing great. She bought a computer, and is trying to limit her online
time to three hours a day. It's an addiction that is obviously inheritable.
The best story this year was when the police came over to my Mom's house.
Her friends, fearing the worst after getting a busy-signal on the phone
for three hours, sent the police over to see if she was okay. Instead of
mimicking that old commercial where the old lady is yelling, &quot;<A HREF=
"fallen.wav">I've fallen, and I can't get up</A>,&quot; Mom was busy on
the internet.</P>

<P><A HREF="lake.html"><IMG SRC="lake/lakehouse.gif" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT=
"90" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Click here to see pictures of the Peterson Retreat"></A>This
summer we spent our weekends in <A HREF="lake.html">Dutch Hollow, Wisconsin</A>.
Krista's dad, <A HREF="lake/dad.jpg">Alan</A>, and stepmother, Elaine, built
a house on the lake a couple of years ago. This year they bought a boat.
We spent our time water skiing on the lake. <A HREF="xmas97/jeff.gif">Jeff</A>,
our friend, is the first person to attempt filtering the whole lake through
his nose while tubing behind the boat.</P>

<P>This summer, we also traveled out east to spend time with our college
friends. First, in May, I went to Baltimore to see an <A HREF="xmas97/balguys.gif">Orioles</A>
game and eat some <A NAME="crab"></A><A HREF="crab.html">crab</A>. We all
got a chance to eat at '<A HREF="xmas97/shanes.gif">Shanes</A>' a colorful,
cultural dinning experience that almost got us killed.<IMG SRC="xmas97/bal.gif"
WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="99" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Orioles Logo"></P>

<P>Krista went out in September to visit her friend Anne, for <A HREF="anne.html">Anne's
thirtieth birthday</A>. Copying us trend setters, the Alphas, went to see
a <A HREF="xmas97/orioles.gif">Baltimore</A> game. However, none of us guys
got a huge wet kiss from a stranger in a bar. Gosh, Anne, does your mom
have access to the internet?</P>

<P>This fall we spent time redoing our <A HREF="http://gulf.uvic.ca/~ajohar/project/taj.html">dining</A>
room. As Dad puts it, &quot;Get a new lamp, redecorate the room.&quot; We
ripped up all the floors on the first floor to expose the maple wood flooring,
and had them sanded. Then we stripped the wallpaper from the dining room.
This left many huge gouges in our wall that were easily filled with ten
pounds of spackel. Krista and her friend, <A HREF="xmas97/joni.gif">Joni</A>,
then feather dusted the walls with paint. Java, seeing how much fun mommy
was having, decided to do some paw painting on our couch -- I love this
dog. After four months of redecorating and floating a loan to buy a dinning
room table, we had the whole family over for <A HREF="lastsupp.jpg">Thanksgiving</A>.</P>

<P>Krista, Christmas, Kristmas -- Coincidence? I don't think so.</P>

<P>Krista has spent the year yelling at me to get off the &quot;damn computer.&quot;
Silly Krista, it's a Dell Computer. I don't think &quot;Damn&quot; makes
computers.</P>

<P>While I continue to grow hair on my entire body and another layer fat
around my waist, my wife keeps getting more and more beautiful. Those long
walks with the dog are keeping her in shape. And, those frequent visits
to Paul keep that hair bouncy-beautiful.</P>

<P>While we have contemplated children, I think Krista keeps spitting out
those watermelon seeds. Maybe we aren't doing something right. Oh well --
<A NAME="practice"></A><A HREF="whatthe.html">practice, practice, practice</A>.</P>

<P>Krista and her friend, <A HREF="xmas97/sally.gif">Sally</A>, hosted the
&quot;Rugby&quot; Christmas party -- a huge hit. Kendra, Krista's sister,
<A HREF="xmas97/xmasparty.gif">catered</A> the event. At this party, Lucy
Pagels was kind enough to explain to me the whole birthing process. I am
going to be in the waiting room -- and that's final.</P>

<P>Krista continues to provide us with all the joy a marriage can bring.
She continually teaches me what a partnership in life we have.</P>
