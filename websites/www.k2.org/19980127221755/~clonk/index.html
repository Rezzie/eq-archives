<P>
Despite a reputation as a flat polluted rust belt city with a terrible climate, 
Chicago actually lives up to its 
<A HREF="http://cpl.lib.uic.edu/004chicago/chimotto.html">
motto</A> "Urbs in Horto" (City in a Garden) 
in many ways.  Although Chicago's natural setting has often been 
regarded as a nuisance to be overcome through engineering, there have always
been at least a few people who appreciated the land as it was.
<P>
Chicago and surrounding Cook County have managed to keep a relatively large 
amount of open land.  The Cook County Forest Preserve District alone accounts 
for about 11% of the county's land mass -- roughly 68,000 acres.  Chicago also 
has its own Park District, as do most of the suburbs.
<P>
Although the parks and forest preserves contain many concrete-based forms of 
amusement, there still a lot of nature out there.  (See the 
<A HREF="critters.html">Critters</A> page for some non-plant examples.)
These pages are a non-commercial attempt to share information about 
these open spaces and the issues affecting them.
(See the full <A HREF="purpose.html">statement of purpose</A> for these pages.)
<P>
Although Chicago isn't located directly on the ocean or even a major river, 
it's still a town with many bridges, barges, and boats.  See the 
<A href="water.html">Water Resources</A> page, which is a first attempt at 
adding some actual content....
<P>
Speaking of water, take a peek at some scuba snaps from 
<A HREF="palau.html">Palau</A>, on the other side of the international
date line, in the North Pacific (but just barely).
<P>
It is outdoors, it does have to do with air and water, and it is a big
form of recreation for many, but it's not really green....  A few snaps
from the preview day of the 1997 <A HREF="airshow.html">Air and Water Show</A>.
<P>
For those who prefer paper, here are a few non-electronic 
<A HREF="references.html">references</A> that have been useful
so far...not that it really shows yet.
