<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Every social function reflects
the tastes of the client and the *guests. Our task is to distill your ideas
into an evening that is both entertaining and sensitive to the complications
of bringing personalities together. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Music is the universal language.
Between our library, your suggestions and guest requests we will create
a mix to please most of the people. If necessary we will purchase music
not in our collection. Feel free to bring your own selections. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Everyone has been annoyed by
an over zealous dj, so before you select one of our dj&Otilde;s we require
you meet with him or her. If you like you may visit one of their shows
to help you make the decision. You must have good feelings about the artist
to eliminate unpleasant surprises. All successful shows are created on
paper first. Face it, a party is not unlike any theatrical production.
It is a good idea to have a script to follow. A script can always be thrown
away or improvised upon. Think about the entrances, the funny bits, the
conflicts, the movement, the blocking, the people, the characters, the
audience and the exits. Let your mind go and make every guest feel welcome.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>No one wants a corny party full
of cliches. We must communicate. Tell us what frightens you most about
having a dj and we will find the way to avoid scaring you. We will be hokey,
only at your request.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>*In order to successfully entertain
every musical taste of our culturally diverse urban environment the DJ
welcomes any Guest to bring their own Music (CD) and will do his very best
to mix it into the program. Your guests must be notified prior to the event
for this to be effective, (ie. flyers in the cafeteria and stairwells and
a delegate to the compile suggestions). This effort almost guarantees satisfaction
in all camps. We are more than happy to assist in any way. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

thrilled to share ideas with you.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>
