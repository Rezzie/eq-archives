Assuming you already have a completed CGI program you wish to 
install in your account, here's how to do it:

<ol>
<li>Make sure the file is executable by everyone: 
<br><font color = "#000000"><tt>chmod a+x mycgiprogram</tt></font>

<p>
<li>Make sure the file ends with
"<tt>.pl</tt>" or "<tt>.cgi</tt>" -- this is
how the server knows that the file is a CGI program to be executed and not
displayed: <br>
<font color = "#000000"><tt>mv mycgiprogram mycgiprogram.cgi</tt></font>
<p>
<li>Make sure the file appears in your public_html
directory. This is really a given.  Note that there is no requirement for
a cgi-bin directory.  You may choose to create one, but the server will
still only recognize files as CGI programs by their file extension (.pl or
.cgi) and not their presence in a cgi-bin directory. 
<br><font color = "#000000"><tt>mv mycgiprogram.cgi ~/public_html</tt></font>

<p>

</ol>

For those venturing to write their own CGI programs, see this 
<a href = "http://www.stars.com/Seminars/CGI/" target="_top">excellent tutorial</a>.

<p>
We have the Perl CGI library module CGI.pm installed at EnterAct.  If
you are an avid Perl CGI coder, you ought to <a href =
"http://www.genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/cgi_docs.html" target="_top">look
into this package</a>.
