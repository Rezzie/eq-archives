We at EnterAct realize that connecting and staying connected to the Internet can be a 
daunting task. It is our goal to provide you with a level of service and help that
will set our company apart as one of the best. There is no charge for support.<p>

There are three ways to get support at EnterAct:<br>
<ul>
        <li><strong>Email</strong><br>
        If you are able to send email, you may send a message to 
        <a href="mailto:support@enteract.com">support@enteract.com</a>.
        Describe your problem as best as you can. This is our prefered method for 
        support. This account is always monitored and many times we check our mail at
        night afterhours. Many simple issues get instant responses.<p>

        <li><strong>News groups</strong><br>
        You may also find help and answers in the newsgroups enteract.help and 
        enteract.discussion. Post your question here if you are experiencing a problem
        you feel may be a common one others will benefit from or know answers to. We read
        these newsgroups as well as knowlegable EnterAct users.<p>
