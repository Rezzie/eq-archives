It is a pleasure to tell you that the 1999 Minneapolis National Gymanfa Ganu Executive Committee has made an early decision to invite the North American Welsh Choir to sing at its Cymanfa Ganu because of the tremendous response to the call for choir members from quality applicants.

As you know, formation of the Choir comes at an important time for our international Welsh-American community, a time of opportunity for renewing and extending our cultural traditions across the continent and giving our trans-Atlantic heritage here a "global" voice.

Indeed, the Choir will be truly continental, with choristers from all over the USA and Canada.  We received initial interest forms from over 120 people from 24 states and 3 provinces, with a good balance of ages and voice parts.  From the information supplied on the application forms, we feel that there is the basis for a very strong and impressive choir - a choir that will strive to be of the highest standard of technical excellence possible while coming together with great spirit and <i>hwyl</i>.  Over the next 18 months we will be working very hard to "shrink" the miles between us all and to form a choir worthy of its title.

The choir will be directed by Mari Morgan, Welsh mezzo-soprano now living in Virginia.

This website will be undergoing major changes over the next couple of months as we develop it as a place to post information about regional rehearsals, announcements about our progress and find ways of using it to keep in close contact with each other.  Please keep checking back!
