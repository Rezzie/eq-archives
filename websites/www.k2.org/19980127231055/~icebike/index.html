        face="Tahoma">Welcome to the ICEBIKE web site. This web
        site is dedicated to the winter cyclist, those who brave
        ice and snow and cycle for transportation, recreation, or
        competition in winter. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/snowtrail.jpg"
        width="467" height="350"></p>
        <p align="left">This site is the companion site to the
        ICEBIKE mailing list. The purpose of the site is to have
        a single point for storing reference information about
        winter cycling, to answer the questions of those just
        starting out, and provide the basics of equipment
        selection, clothing choices, and to serve as a bulletin
        board of winter cycling events.</p>
        <p align="left">Not all information is maintained on this
        site. Some is maintained at the web sites of various
        contributors, other information is provided by <u>very</u>
        selective links to to other sites. This is done to save
        web space (we're cheap) and to spread the work load.
        There are no funds supporting this site, its a labor of
        love, or addiction as the case may be. </p>
        <p align="left">Further, nothing on this site is carved
        in stone or even sculpted in ice. Based on input from
        others we will change our mind, revise our
        recommendations, and recognize our differences. We don't
        know it all, we haven't done it all, and we haven't been
        everywhere. If you don't believe something you've seen
        here join the ICEBIKE Mailing list and ask a question,
        make a point, or offer an opinion. You will not be hooted
        down, or chased away. It's a friendly group. You can also
        <a href="mailto:icebike@enteract.com" target="_top">Email
        the Webmaster</a> with your opinion or a suggestion.</p>
        <h3 align="center"><font color="#000080" size="5">Who are
        the Winter Cyclists? </font></h3>
        <p>Most of us are just ordinary folks who get this
        addiction to bicycles that simply will not live within
        the bounds of a summer. Others just don't want to spend
        the cash for a car and all the costs that come with motor
        vehicles. Some of us have serious personal commitments to
        being car-free, other have temporary problems of
        liquidity, and others of us just like cycling way more
        than any rational person should. </p>
        <p align="left"><strong><u>Its an addiction</u></strong>.
        Handling a bike on ice requires more skill than summer
        riding, and plowing through snow is very tiring. The
        rewards are the beauty of the scenery, the quite of the
        road on a frosty night, and the crunch of crisp snow
        under your tire. <em><strong>Making the first track!</strong></em></p>
        <h3 align="center"><font color="#000080">Where can I meet
        other ICEBIKERS?</font> </h3>
        <p align="left">Out on the road, or on the trails, riding
        across frozen lakes and rivers. You can also find out
        about the <a href="icebikelist.htm" target="_top">ICEBIKE
        mailing list</a>, and subscribe to a moderate volume of
        ICEBIKE related chatter, which will give you something to
        read on those long winter nights. Its very quite in the
        summer, but lively in the winter.</p>

                web site while looking for something else. If so

                folks are. Plenty! </strong></p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Contrary to popular
                opinion, the bicycle makes a fairly good winter
                vehicle. This is not to suggest that care can be
                thrown to the winds. But with proper skill and
                technique, the bike provides safe and reliable
                transportation. It always starts, regardless of
                how cold it is. There are studded tires that make
                the most wicked slick ice manageable. It is easy
                to find a parking space, and it never gets stuck
                in the snow. Well, almost never.</strong></p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Much of winter cycling is
                done on road that are bare, no ice anywhere. In
                these conditions, the only concern is the
                weather. If you would go skiing or play hockey in
                cold weather, then ICEBIKING is not very
                different. All it takes is the will, a reliable
                bike, </strong><font color="#000000"><strong>dressing
