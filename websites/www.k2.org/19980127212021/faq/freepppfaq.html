<P><h3><b>Baud Rate</b></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<P>Make sure that your baud rate is set correctly.  If it is set too high,
you may not connect well, or even at all.  28,800 modems should be set no higher than 57,600 bps and 14,400 modems should be set no higher than 38,400.</font>
<p><h3><b>Init Strings</b></h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p>If your modem won't even initialize, try changing your initialization 
string.  To find the place to edit the init string, edit your EnterAct
entry and choose the Connection tab.  Try using 
<font color=#bb0000>AT&F</font> or  
<font color=#bb0000>AT&F1</font> first.  If those don't work, just go to  
<font color=#bb0000>ATZ</font> as a very basic string that will reset the 
modem.   If it doesn't respond to <font color=#bb0000>ATZ</font>, then the 
problem is not with the init string, but probably something to do with your 
modem not being plugged in or working correctly.
