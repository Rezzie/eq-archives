<font color=#110860><h3>Download Software</h3></font>
<ol>
<li>If you want to download this software as opposed to receiving it on floppy disks from us, please
click <a href="ftp://ftp.enteract.com/software/windows/ieak/iew31.exe">here</a>.
<li>Save this file to a temporary directory on your hard drive.
<li>Run the self-extracting executable file you just downloaded by double clicking it.
</ol>
<font color=#110860><h3>Installation</h3></font>
<ol>
<li>If you are installing from the downloaded version of this software, double click <font color=#bb0000>setup.exe</font> and
continue on to step 5.
<li>If you are installing from floppy disks, please insert <font color=#bb0000>disk 1</font> in the 
<font color=#bb0000><code>A:\</code></font> drive.
<li>From your program manager, click on the <font color=#bb0000>File</font> pull-down menu and select <font color=#bb0000>Run</font>.
<li>In the empty field provided, type, <font color=#bb0000><code>a:\setup.exe</code></font>. This will begin the process of installation.  You will be asked whether you want to do a complete or a custom install.  If you only want to install some of the 
components, choose custom, otherwise choose complete.
<li>Read the instructions that the setup program will give to you and follow the prompts.  Most often this will only mean clicking an <font color=#bb0000>OK</font> button.  
<li>After you have put in <font color=#bb0000>Disk 3</font>, the setup program will want you to select your modem.  Have the software find it for you automatically by clicking <font color=#bb0000>Next</font>.  
<li>If it cannot find your modem, make sure that the modem is on and plugged in properly.  
<li>If it cannot detect which type of modem you are using, manually select it from the list given.  If you do not see your modem listed, choose the standard modem default option at the top of the list.  
<li>Once the program has finished its installation, you will have to reboot.  
<li>That's pretty much all there is to installation.  Everything will be preconfigured for you so you won't need any settings from us.

</ol>

<font color=#110860><h3>Now What?</h3></font>
<ol>
<li>After you have completed the installation of the software and have rebooted your machine,
you will be left with a few icons located in a Microsoft Internet Explorer program group on
your desktop.  
<li>You can click on the icon that says <font color=#bb0000>Get me on the Internet</font>.  
<li>You will then see a screen with EnterAct's emblem on it and an <font color=#bb0000>install</font> button. Please click that button to complete the installation process.
<li>You will then see an EnterAct icon appear in your program group.  Click that icon to bring up your dialer.
<li>You will see the following screen:
<p>
<center><img src="Iexplore/connecto.gif"></img></center>
<p>
<li>Enter your username and password where prompted.
<li>The default phone number is set for Chicago.  If this is not local to you, please change it to your 
<a href="http://www.enteract.com/where.html">local dialup number</a>. 
<li>Before you click <font color=#bb0000>Connect</font>, click the <font color=#bb0000>Properties</font> button.
<li>You will see the following screen:
<p>
<center><img src="Iexplore/general.gif"></img></center>
<p>
<li>The only setting you need to be aware of on this screen is the idle timeout setting.  You do not need to 
check this box because EnterAct will automatically disconnect you after 20 minutes of idle time.
<li>The rest of the options are up to you.
<li>Click the <font color=#bb0000>Modem</font> tab.
<li>You will see the following screen:
<p>
<center><img src="Iexplore/modem.gif"></img></center>
<p>
<li>The baud rate may default to the wrong speed regardless of whether you chose the modem from a list or not.  For 28.8 modems, 
you can change this to <font color=#bb0000>57,600</font>. For 14.4 modems, you can change this to 
<font color=#bb0000>38,400</font>.  
<li>Click the <font color=#bb0000>TCP/IP</font> tab.
<li>You will see the following screen:
<p>
<center><img src="Iexplore/desktop.gif"></img></center>
<p>
<li>The DNS addresses should already be correct, but make sure that they are set to 
<font color=#bb0000>207.229.143.1</font> and <font color=#bb0000>207.229.143.2</font>.
<li>Click <font color=#bb0000>OK</font> when done.
<li>To dial, click the <font color=#bb0000>Connect</font> button.
<li>Your modem will then dial and you will see the following screen when you are connected:
<p>
<center><img src="Iexplore/connectd.gif"></img></center>
<p>
<li>From here you can minimize this window and open up your Internet Explorer web browser by double clicking the globe icon
that you have in your program group.  Internet Explorer may come up automatically if you have it configured to do so.
<li>Happy Surfing!
