ENTERACT USER AGREEMENT

USAGE
The user agrees to use a connection only while personally, actively using
it. The user agrees not to use this link as the equivalent of a dedicated

generally accepted guidelines on Internet usage, such as restrictions on

and would be a likely cause for termination of my account.

User understands that EnterAct bills its accounts on a recurring basis and I
authorize these charges to my credit card. User understands that e-mail
statements will be the only statement sent, unless paper statements are
specifically requested. User agrees that failure to pay a statement before
its due date is a potential cause for termination.

harmless for damages from this also. The user also agrees to indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless EnterAct, L.L.C. from any lawsuit arising from the

TERMINATION OF SERVICE
In the event the user would like discontinue using EnterAct, L.L.C.
services, verifiable notification is required. As of the date of the

that they have used. Any credit remaining in a user's account will be
refunded within 20 days. Setup and startup fees are not refunded.
