<p align="left"><font color="#000000">Welcome to the page from
Dave and Mike, two boys from Chi-caw-go. We're here, we're queer
and we've got computer software. Hence, this webpage. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000">About Mike (since it's his
computer): He's 32, a native of the Chicago suburbs and acts in
local theatre in such shows as SOUTH PACIFIC, AS YOU LIKE IT, THE
MARQUISE and very soon, SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL. He's terrific. He
also is the HTML expert.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000">About Dave (since he wrote
Mike's): He's 35, a native of Rush Limbaugh's hometown of Cape
Girardeau, Mo., and a 15-year veteran of daily newspapers and
trade magazines. He is also the writer and editor of the web
page.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000">Dave loves movies and
television as much as Mike loves theatre. As opposite as we are,
we seem to make things work, which we have for nearly three
years. There's a really romantic &quot;love-at-first-sight&quot;
story there somewhere, but you need to get your insulin ready
first.</font></p>

<p align="center">We live in a two-flat in the Ravenswood area of
Chicago (northwest of Wrigley Field) with three cats, one beagle,
and a straight roommate, <a href="paula.htm">Paula, </a>a fellow
journalist. </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Visitors to Chicago know it's tough to
find a bad meal here. We've found some, but we also have some
hidden treasures in the Lakeview/Ravenswood area that are worth
sharing. </font><a href="Neigh.html"><font color="#000000"
