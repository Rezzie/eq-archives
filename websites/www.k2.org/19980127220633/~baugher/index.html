<P>	Human history represents such a radical break with the natural systems of biological organization that preceded it, that it must be the response to a kind of attractor or dwell point that lies ahead in the temporal dimension. Persistently Western religions have integrated into their theologies the notion of a kind of "end of the world" and I think that a lot of psychedelic experimentation sort of confirms this intuition. It isn't going to happen according to any of the scenarios of orthodox religion, but the basic intuition that the universe seeks closure in a kind of omega point of transcendence is confirmed. It's almost as though this object in hyperspace; glittering in hyperspace, thows off reflections of itself which actually riccochet into the past; illuminationg this mystic, inspiring that saint or visionary, and that out of these fragmentary glimpses of eternity, we can build a kind of map of not only the past of the universe and the evolutionary ingression into novelty, but a kind of map of the future. This is what "Shamanism" has always been about. A "Shaman" is someone who has been to the end. It's someone who knows how the world really works. And "knowing how the world really works", means to have risen outside, above, beyond, the dimensions of ordinary space time and causillustry, and actually seen the wiring under the board; stepped outside the confines of learned culture, and learned and imbeded language, into the domain of what Wittgenstein called "the unspeakable, the transcendental presence of the other", which can be sectioned in various ways to yield systems of knowledge which can be brought back into ordinary social space for the good of the community. So in the context of ninety percent of human culture, the "shaman" has been the agent of evolution, because the "shaman" learns the techniques to go between ordinary reality and the domain of the ideas. This higher dimensional continuum that is somehow parallel to us, available to us, and yet ordinarily occluded by cultural convention, out of fear of the mystery. I believe that what "shamans" are, are people who have been able to decondition themselves from the communities instinctual distrust of the mystery, and to go into it; to go into this bewildering higher dimension and gain knowledge, recover the jewel lost at the beginning of time; save souls, cure, commune with the ancestors, so forth and so on. A "shamanism" is not a religion, it is a set of techniques. And the principal technique is the use of psychedelic plants. What psychedelics do is they dissolve boundaries. And in the presence of dissolved boundaries, one cannot continue to close ones eyes to the ruination of the earth, the poisoning of the seas, and the consequences of 2000 years of unchallenged dominator culture, based on monotheism, hatred of nature, suppresion of the female, so forth and so on. So what "shamans" have to do is act as exemplars, by making this cosmic journey to the domain of the Gaian ideas, and then bringing them back, in the form of art, to the struggle to save the world. The planet has a kind of intelligence that it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being. The message that nature sends is: 'Transform your language into a synergy between electronic culture and the psychedelic imagination; a synergy between dance and idea; a synergy between understanding and intuition, and dissolve the boundaries that your culture has sanctioned between them. Become part of this Gaian supermind. I think it's fairly profound. It's fairly apocalyptic. History is ending. We are to be the generation that witnesses the revellation of the purpose of the cosmos. History is the shockwave of the escheton. History is the shockwave of eschetology. And what this means for those of us who will live through this transition into hyperspace, is that we will be privileged to see the greatest release of concressed change probably since the birth of the universe. The 20th century is the shudder that announces the approaching cataracts of time over which our species and the destiny of this planet is about to be swept.</P><BR><BR>

	The emphasis in house music and rave culture on physiologically compatible rhythms and this sort of thing, is really the rediscovery of the art of natural magic with sound, that sound properly understood, especially percussive sound, can actually change neurological states in large groups of people getting together in the presence of this kind of music are creating a telepathic community of bonding that hopefully will be strong enough then to carry the vision out into the mainstream of society. I think the youth culture that is emerging in the Nineties, is an end of the millenium culture that is actually summing up Western Civilization and pointing us in an entirely different direction, That we're going to arrive in the third millenium in the middle of an archaic revival which will mean a revival of these physiologically empowering rhythm signatures, a new art, a new social vision, a new relationship to nature, to feminism to ego. All of these things are taking hold, and not a moment too soon.</P>
