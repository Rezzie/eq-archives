                unless you choose to.<br>
                <br>
                Flexibility is a key component of Windfall's
                philosophy. If your vision for a Web site changes
                over time, Windfall is willing and able to adapt.<br>
                <br>
                Hourly billing is straightforward, with
                descriptions of services rendered charted next to
                accurate time entries.  This applies to work done after initial contract is completed.<br>

                If a client wishes to move their Web site from
                Windfall's server to their own at any point,
                Windfall is willing to aid in this simple
                process. </td>
