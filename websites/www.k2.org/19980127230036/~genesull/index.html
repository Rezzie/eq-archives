I worked as an Electrical Engineer for about 35 years, doing electronic 
design and programming.  I am now semi-retired.  I do some Visual Basic 
programming, low cost but slow because I take a lot of vacations.  
Still using Windows3.1 and Visual Basic 3.  Haven't found a good reason 
to change yet.  Also do some sales for a product design company and will
be designing web pages for a little extra spending money (for software
or computer hardware).</PRE>
