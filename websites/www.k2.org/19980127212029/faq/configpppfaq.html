<P><h3><b>My Open Button is Grey!</b></h3>
<font color=#000000>Make sure  <font color=#bb0000>PPP</font> is highlighted in MacTCP.  
If anything else is highlighted, you won't be able to dial out.  Make sure
you don't have both  <font color=#bb0000>SLIP</font> and  
<font color=#bb0000>PPP</font> highlighted at the same time.  If this is the 
case, trash the  <font color=#bb0000>SLIP</font> extension and reboot.
<p>Even if PPP is the only thing highlighted, try clicking on it again and
rebooting.  Sometimes that is all it takes to get it to work again.
<p>If this doesn't fix the problem, make sure you have  
<font color=#bb0000>PPP</font> in your extensions folder.  
The extensions folder can be found in your system folder.
</font>
<P><h3><b>Authentication</b></h3>
<font color=#000000>
You can configure a Mac to log in automatically without setting a connect 
script.  Open your  <font color=#bb0000>ConfigPPP</font> and you will see a  
<font color=#bb0000>Config</font> button. Click that and you will see an  
<font color=#bb0000>Authentication</font> button and a  
<font color=#bb0000>Connect Script</font> button.  Verify that there 
is nothing in the connect script.  In addition, make sure that your username 
and password is filled in for  <font color=#bb0000>Authentication</font>.  
Make sure they are entered in lower case characters.
</font>
<p><h3><b>Time out</b></h3>
<font color=#000000>
Sometimes timeout settings need to be increased in order for the 
connection to complete.  Click the  <font color=#bb0000>Config</font>
button. 
There are two buttons called  <font color=#bb0000>ICP Options</font> and  
<font color=#bb0000>LPCP Options</font>.  In each of these there will be a 
timeout value that defaults to 3 seconds.  Increase this to 15.
</font>
<P><h3><b>Remove Preferences File and Start Over</b></h3>
<font color=#000000>
If everything seems to be set up okay, but you still can't connect, try 
trashing your  <font color=#bb0000>PPP preferences</font> file, located in 
the preferences folder.  After trashing it, you'll need to reconfigure 
ConfigPPP</font>.
<P><a name=deadlink><h3>Link Dead and Apple Talk</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<P>If you receive a "link dead" error message, and all of their settings seem 
right, go to the  <font color=#bb0000>Chooser</font>, found under the  
<font color=#bb0000>Apple</font> menu.  If  
<font color=#bb0000>Apple Talk</font> is active, make it inactive and reboot.  
This should solve the problem.
</font>
<p><a name=macbaud><h3>Baud Rate</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<P>Make sure that your baud rate is set correctly.  If it is set too high,
you may not connect well, or even at all.  28,800 modems should be set no 
higher than 57,600 bps and 14,400 modems should be set no higher than 38,400.
</font>
<p><a name=macinit><h3>Init Strings</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>If your modem won't even initialize, try changing your initialization string.  Try using  <font color=#bb0000>AT&F</font> or  <font color=#bb0000>AT&F1</font> first.  If those don't work, just go to  <font color=#bb0000>ATZ</font> as a very basic 
string that will reset the modem.   If it doesn't respond to  <font color=#bb0000>ATZ</font>, then the problem is not with the init string, but probably something to do with your modem not being plugged in or working correctly.
