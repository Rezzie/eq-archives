<li>If you haven't already, download News Express from <A HREF="HTTP://www.tucows.com" 
target="_top">www.tucows.com</A>.
<li><A HREF="zip.html">Unzip</A> the program into its own directory on your hard drive.
<li>Run the <code><font color=#bb0000>nx.exe</font></code> file that is created after you have unzipped the downloaded file.
<li>The first time you run the program, you will see the following screen:<br>

<p>
<li>You want to select <font color=#bb0000>Retrieve new groups only [if any]</font>.  This will make News Express bring down only new news groups as opposed to every single news group (there are over 16,000 of them) every time you connect to the news server.
<li>Click the <font color=#bb0000>Servers and Directory</font> tab.  You will see the following screen:<br>
<p>

<p>
<li>The <font color=#bb0000>News [NNTP] server</font> should be <font color=#bb0000>news.enteract.com</font>.
<li>IMPORTANT: Leave the username and password fields blank.  If you fill these fields in, you will not be able to connect to the news server.
<li>The <font color=#bb0000>Mail [SMTP] server</font> is <font color=#bb0000>smtp.enteract.com</font>.
<li>Leave the <font color=#bb0000>Home directory</font> as the default value that News Express already entered.
<li>Click on the <font color=#bb0000>Personal Information</font> tab.  You will see the following screen:<br>
<p>
<center>
<IMG WIDTH=446 HEIGHT=437 SRC="newsexp3.gif"></IMG>
</center>
<p>
<li>Fill in your name and e-mail address (<font color=#bb0000>username@enteract.com</font>).  You can leave the <font color=#bb0000>Organization</font> and <font color=#bb0000>Default signature file</font> blank if you wish.
<li>The rest of the options are up to you.  Feel free to look through all the tabs and change whatever settings you desire.  When done, click <font color=#bb0000>OK</font>.  NOTE:  You can go back to these settings at any time by going to 
<font color=#bb0000>File/Options</font> in the main <font color=#bb0000>News Express</font> window (as seen below).<br>

<li>Now, because you don't want to be subscribed to all 17,000+ groups (who has time to read them all anyway??), you want to subscribe to only those that interest you.  News Express allows you to search for the groups you want.  Let's say you want to see 


all of the music groups.  You would then just type <font color=#bb0000>music</font> in the <font color=#bb0000>Search</font> field located in the lower right hand corner of the screen.  You would see the following screen:<br>
<p>

<IMG WIDTH=567 HEIGHT=406 SRC="newsexp5.gif"></IMG>
</center>
<p>
<li>As you can see, only the groups with the string <font color=#bb0000>music</font> are listed.  To subscribe to one of them, just click the little round ball located to the left of the group name. Once you are finished subscribing to groups, these 
groups will be found again by clicking on the <font color=#bb0000>Subscribed</font> groups tab so that you don't have to wade through all of the groups every time you go into News Express.
<li>To read the articles in a group, simply double click the group you want to go into and then double click the article you want to read.
<li>That should get you started.  For more information about News Express, check out their on-line Help menu from the main screen.
