<BODY>
<H2> Current Projects: </H2> 
<H4> Work: </h4>
I'm currently unemployed, but looking for a programming or 
UNIX system administration job; here's my current <a
href=resume.html>resume</a>, also available in <a
href=resume.ps.gz>gzipped PostScript</a> format (which looks better printed).

<H4> Linux Memory Management </h4>
<P>Current development (2.1) Linux kernels allow the code which allocates IP fragment
	reassembly buffers to sleep, but don't actually work to create free areas
	of the requested size.  This causes major problems with NFS unless the
	<CODE>rsize</code> and <CODE>wsize</code> are small enough (1k) not to 
	fragment on the Ethernet; using 8k I/O (as Sun intended) leads to out
	of memory errrors in the IP <CODE>queue_glue</code> function, which
	repeat until the NFS protocol times out, rather than fixing themselves
	in any way.  I'm looking into implementing a reverse page
	table (to be always correct, but not necessarily helpful for shared
	pages) on the way to implenting a memory defragmenter (which would move
	virtually addressed user pages around in memory without the overhead
	of swapping), as well as 
	methods for fragmentation avoidance.  </p>
<P>A patch to 2.1.76 by Linus Torvalds
	to <A href="patch-2.1.76-ration-fragments">ration the last few free areas</a> 
	(as the last few free pages were already rationed) helps avoid the
	problem.  An additional patch I devised, which <A 
	HREF="patch-2.1.76-segregate-fragments">segregates DMA-capable free memory 
	regions</a> at the ends of the free lists, and searches backwards through
	the free lists when DMA-capable or large memory allocations are performed,
	seems to help my machine not only avoid problem fragmentation, but relieves
	fragmentation through normal paging.  You can also try the <A
	HREF="patch-2.1.76-r+s-fragments">combined patch against stock 2.1.76</a>
	if you want both patches in one; Linus said he'd include the ration-fragments
	policy in 2.1.77, so the segregate-fragments patch might apply more
	cleanly to current versions. </p>

<H4> <A HREF="run-1.0.tar.gz"> <CODE>run</code> and <CODE>randomfile</code></a> </h4>
The <CODE>run</code> program is a quick little Perl hack which associates files
      with the programs which handle them.  You can just say "run
      foo.mp2 bar.wav" without having to worry about finding a program
      which can play both.  The <CODE>randomfile</code> program picks
      a file at random from a standard UNIX-style path specification.
      The two go together nicely; I can say <CODE>run `randomfile
	~/lib/music:~/lib/mod:~/lib/midi`</code> and presto, some
      piece of music plays.


<H4> <A HREF="http://hegel.ittc.ukans.edu/projects/utime/"> UTIME</a> </h4>
While I'm not officially affiliated with the UTIME project, it's
      useful for my research.  Currently the latest version (1.15) runs
      on 2.1.76 (and possibly later) just fine.


<H4> Continued Research: </H4>
I'm still keeping my hand in with my research to some extent; the
      Linux (primary) version.  The <A
	HREF="http://hegel.ittc.ukans.edu/projects/utime/"> UTIME</a>
      microsecond-<wbr>resolution timer project greatly improves the
      jitter exhibited by my server, but alas causes more recent
      (somewhere post-2.1.43) development versions of Linux to
      crash.  I plan to try 2.0.3latest and see if that's stable with
      UTIME; I also plan to check out <A
	  HREF="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/">LinuxThreads</a> 
	so I can get rid of the shared memory limitation in the server...

<H4> Perl, Ain't It Swell? </H4>
I've read the Camel Book, I mostly understand the Camel Book,
and I have acquired new respect for the term "context
sensitive".  That <CODE>$foo</code> and <CODE>@foo</code> are
two completely different variables was bad enough...

<H2> Recent Projects:</H2>
<H4> Research: </h4>
I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-<wbr>Champaign with
      an MS in Computer Science.  My thesis (available as <a
	href="thesis.ps.gz"> gzipped PostScript</a>) deals with
      buffer sharing issues for continuous media (e.g. streaming
	  video) servers.

<H4> Software I Have Known: </h4>
<P> <IMG SRC=penguin.gif width=251 height=301 ALT="penguin" align=top> Linux is
	    cool.  I get my kernel patches from <A
HREF=ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.1>kernel.org</a>, and my
favorite Sunsite mirror is, of course, <A
HREF=ftp://uiarchive.uiuc.edu/pub/systems/linux/sunsite>at UIUC</a>.</P>

<P> <IMG SRC=play2.jpg width=256 height=256 ALIGN=left> 
    <IMG SRC=play1.jpg width=256 height=256 ALIGN=right> 
	The <A HREF=http://www.gimp.org>Gimp</a> is an image manipulation program
	which is said to rival Photoshop, though each is also said to have
	different strengths.  You'll need the <A HREF=ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gtk>
	GTK</a> to build it; it's no longer bundled with the Gimp, but neither
	alas is an obvious link to it.  Also useful (if alpha) is this
	third-party <A HREF=ftp://ftp.frozenriver.ale.se/pub/Gimpmanual/>manual</a>.</p>
<br><br>
<P> I've been looking into new window managers and desktop environments for X11.
	The <A HREF=http://www.kde.org>KDE</a> desktop environment is looking good;
	it really is in beta, especially the KRN newsreader.  Also, the
	<A HREF=http://www.rasterman.com>Enlightenment</a> window manager is looking
	good if alpha; there's a lot of themes (some of which even work correctly
	out of the box) at <A HREF="http://box.whiting.co.uk/~kirth/e">this page</a>,
	which requires JavaScript for no evident good reason.  He seems a bit
	ticked off about people linking directly to the <CODE>themes</code>
	subdirectory, or I'd bypass his JavaScript glitzy crap for you. </p>
<br>
<P> I like <A
href=http://locke.ccil.org/~esr/fetchmail/><CODE>fetchmail</code></a>,
and even contributed a patch once upon a time.  It's great for getting
mail from my mailbox at my ISP into the wonderful world of my private
network, and lets me feel like setting up sendmail and using something
other than Netscape for outgoing mail are worthwhile things to
do...  Check out the rest of <A
HREF=http://locke.ccil.org/~esr/home.html>Eric Raymond</a>'s stuff
while you're hunting.</p>

<H2> Hardware I've Used: </h2>

<H4> Symbios Logic (formerly NCR) 53c810-based F/W PCI SCSI Adapter </h4>
<P> These work like a charm, and AFAIK still cost less than the Adaptec
competition.  (Yes, they're inexpensive, yet they do bus master!)  The
noteworthy bit is that some motherboard BIOSes don't come with the
BIOS support for the biosless 810-based cards.  However, get the 3.07
BIOS from <A HREF=www.symbios.com>Symbios Logic</a>, and the <CODE>PROG</code>
file from <A HREF=http://www.tekram.com/TECHNICAL/DC390WFUDB.html>Tekram</a>
and you'll be able to install the SDMS BIOS into your mainboard BIOS...
or remove it, if you've already got it and it's causing conflicts with
a 53c8xx card with onboard BIOS (e.g. Fireport 40 for some?).</p>
<br>

<H2> Other Stuff: </H2>

<h4> Code: </h4>
Just to annoy folks, here's my <a

geek code</a>, updated 97c23...

Because all home pages must link to friends' home pages, <a
href="http://www.wfu.edu/~dankmyka/loki.html">here</a>'s one. <br>
<br>
<h4> Bland: </h4>
This page has been Lynx-enhanced for the time-impaired (i.e., me). <br>
<br>
<h4> Obscene: </h4>
Oh, yeah, and stop the <a href="http://www.cdt.org/cda.html">Communications 
Decency Act</A> (done!) and whatever other rank stupidity the legislature
may pass in the wake of its defanging without knowing what they're doing.  
Here's <a href=ftcda.html> my "G-rated" take</a>.<br>
<br>
<h4> Scary: </h4>
Studies show that <a 
href="http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/home.html"> Scientology
may be evil</a>...and appears to be, at the very least, scary...
<br><br>
<h4> Scarier: </h4>
Two sets of experiments on Twinkies, one
<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~gouge/twinkies.html"> with haiku </a>,
the other <A href=twinkies> without</a>.
<br><br>
<h4> Scarily Stupid: </h4>
Someone sues a college over a <a href=dumb.msg> programming assignment </a>
which a prof of mine has given to high schoolers.  Note however that the
solution's sales tax figure is off by two orders of magnitude.

<br><br>
<h4> Just Plain Dumb: </h4>
You have better things to do with your time than look at <a
href="http://ucunix.san.uc.edu/~waltza/PAMELADir.html"> this</a>.  Really.
This page couldn't succumb to link rot fast enough.<br><br>

<h4> Plea for Attention: </h4>
Because I am bored, I will graciously allow those of you who can't
figure out my email address or don't know how to use the keyboard to
<a href="mailto:kwrohrer@enteract.com">mail</a> me.  What those of
you who don't know how to use the keyboard will do with that mailto
link, I may never guess.<br>

<br>
<h4> Traumatization Sucks: </h4>
Special thanks to so-called friends in Grinnell who led me to watch an
episode of Beavis and Butthead; from now on, the phrase "morning wood"
will always have special meaning.  I curse you all roundly. <br>
<br>
<h4> Traumatization for You: </h4>
A couple <a href=keith_1.gif> pictures</a> <a href=keith_2.gif> of </a>
<a href=keith_3.gif> me</a>.  I sincerely hope I forgot to upload the
gifs those links point to...
<br>
<br>

<h4> Ballsy: </h4>
All hail <a href="http://www.jaked.org/8ball.html">online divination</a>.
Also, <a href="ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/religion/discordian/Techno/Tarot">
Discordian Tarot</a> cards, though I liked it better when it gave you a
"reading".

<p><br><br>
<!--<h4> Fun: </h4>
Last, but not least, I'm putting up some <a href=champs> Champions characters
</a>; more will follow sooner or later, as well as a set of house rules
I'm continually refining and ironing out.  (No, these haven't made it to
the new account yet either.) -->
