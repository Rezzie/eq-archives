this and you folks have been great with any questions I may have. 
Thanks for being here.

Are all Internet Service Providers created equal? I think not! Time and time again
Enteract has shown that they are the premier ISP in the Chicagoland area. Why you
may ask? It's simple....great customer service! It's refreshing to call a business
and have a friendly, competent person answer the phone without having to punch
through a myriad of phone prompts.
<p>  
I have been with Enteract for about a year. I didn't sign up because of a glowing
recommendation from a friend, but only because Enteract offered CGI support for
personal accounts. My impressions with Enteract were quickly made with one phone
call and one e-mail. My first phone call and question were answered immediately,
without a single phone prompt. My first e-mail to support was about a problem I had
with my first attempt at running a CGI script. Not only did I get a quick reply, but
the responder also fixed my script! That's what I call dedication! The great service
has not stopped. Just last Sunday afternoon, I e-mailed support about a problem I
was having getting a SSI to work without having to change my file extension. I was
emailed back that evening with a resolution, and it worked perfectly! Do you guys
ever take time off?
<p>  
The main reason for sending this e-mail was because of the e-mail I just received
from Enteract about the goings on. I realized that I have received these types of
e-mails regularly, letting me know of any changes, improvements, problems, and of
course, info on your fine staff. I figured I should take a few minutes and let you
know that I appreciate getting my moneys worth from my ISP. Keep up the good work!

If an ISP were GIVING their service away for "Free" I would have to decline because
of the extremely high level of service and professionalism I receive from your
company.

I have been with Enteract since November 1997 -- I must say that it is positively
refreshing to have an ISP that I can actually get through on -- consistently --
being able to get on with few exceptions as opposed to getting on as an exception!
<p>
I must admit that when I first found Enteract (the only ISP who had a local access
number in my area) - I was slightly reluctant because there was no "free month" of
service offered.  However, in retrospect I am so thankful I did not pass up the
opportunity to use enteract as my ISP because:  Unfailing access, Unbelievable
technical support, downloads that actually complete without cutting me off 2
minutes before the 10 megs would have been done and an ISP which actually offers a
56K connection that exceeds 38000 bps!  Typically I am connecting at 48000 bps!
<p>
Additionally,  absolutely every employee of Enteract whom I have had the PLEASURE of
dealing with deserves commendation.  Not only was I treated courteously,
professionally and even received answers to my questions but also not once did I
feel that I was talking with someone who thought they were a "computer god" looking
down their nose at me!!!
<p>
On at least two occasions I have called in with problems that in all reality were
not Enteract's problem to help me with.  Was I turned away, told to call this
company or that?????  NO NO NO.  Enteract once again came through with style.
Patiently I was helped with my "dilemma."
<p>
The bottom line is that there are not enough nice things that I can say about
Enteract.

If for no other reason, the support Enteract supplies will keep me as a
customer. I must say that I rarely need help, but when I can't get online at all,
it makes it very difficult to find out what's wrong.
I just got done building a new system, and experienced Win 95 problems
(go figure). Thanks to Marcus in tech support I was up and running within 15 minutes.

I have recently availed myself of the T1 service provided by Mediaone.
Although the service is fast, I thought you might like to know how I
appreciate the ability to use Enteract as a back-up to the Mediaone
service which has been down for at least 5 days in the last 2 months.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I am using the Enteract connection today due to the cable being down. 
Important email is expected and Enteract will save the day.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Keep up the good work.  Enteract is a high class service which I have
recommended to everyone looking for an ISP.

It is easy to offer judgement on a company's product after a few weeks or
months of use.  After more than a year of using an EnterAct SoloAct account, I
feel confident that the fantastic service, extremely patient technical support
and quality connections I have received are not a fluke; you folks are truly a
daisy amongst dandelions.

The reason I decided to go with Enteract was because of Chris Ptacek.  He was
very helpful, nice and respectful.  He answered all my questions and didn't
pressure me.  After I signed up with Enteract he helped me get everything set 
up to go online.  Well, I screwed up and cleared out a few files on 
accident, and my computer wouldn't work properly.  Called DELL and 
they sent me a CD-ROM that completley erased my hard drive and 
restored it to orginal, like-new condition.  So, I had to call Chris 
again, and he had to help me get set up again, and he also had to 
help me get my email set up again.  Needless to say, like an idiot, I 
did it AGAIN and had to go through the whole process again for the 
third time, of course with Chris.  This whole ordeal I put him 
through was probably quite irratating but he never complained.  He 
was allways helpful, nice and never got upset (or atleast never even 
showed it) with me.  He allways returned my call within 15 minutes 
and he allways had the answers.  This whole process after I was 
finanly done probably involved 20-25 calls to Mr Ptacek and well 
over an hour and a half of talk time on the phone.  He never 
complained.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that it is hard to 
find a GOOD employee now days (believe me I know I work for the 
government and I am in management), and I truly believe your company 
has found one in Mr Ptacek.  Better treat him well, there's not many 
around like him anymore.

I recently bailed out from my ISP; I won't name names but in a mirror it
would be sseccAretnI. *smile* I left because they simply could not figure
out what happened to their dialups and why me and many others could no
longer connect. Two months... nuthin'

I wanted to say first that I've absolutely loved Enteract from the moment I
switched over my setting to dial you up. The initial set-up was
unbelievable. I was on in literally about 5 minutes; and half of that was
changing settings in my programs!

Secondly I really enjoyed your update. I appreciated its unprofessionalism;
and by that I mean it was nice to get an update from what actually seemed
to be a real person not generated by some rhetoric machine. That other ISP
sent out notes and it was always about as personal as the Prez of Honda
sending you a letter to thank you for your recent car purchase. Also, they
never gave any real answers or said anything, like a response to a bug
report from Microsoft. Your update was a breath of fresh air to me. Keep up
the good work; nice to see that thigns are being run by people not
figure-heads that obviously don't care as long as the checks keep coming in.

I just wanted to drop a line to thank EVERYONE at EnterAct for
their fantastic service.  Yesterday I attempted to upload my
first-ever cgi form, and needless to say, it was a challenge.  I
must have called the service line at least 10 times over the
course of the day, and was always rewarded with expert advice
delivered in a warm and friendly manner.  Everyone was
fantastically helpful, but I especially want to commend Jessica,
Ben and Mark for their help -- you folks are super!

I wish I could remember the name of the man that helped me this afternoon [Chris
Ptacek, ladies and gentlemen]. I was successfully dialing up anyone of your modem
pools, but was unable to complete the connection to your email server.  I finally gave
up and called your customer service.  The young man who answered the call was
extremely helpful and assisted me in optimising my Windows 95 dialer configuration for
the specific modem pool I am dialing.<br>
I realize that there is nothing Enteract can do about Ameritech "system
busy signals" in my local exchange here in St. Charles, and that there are
a very few times when your system may be overloaded.  I consider that to be somewhat
a luck of the draw situation.  But when I usually connect, my login is now
faster by a factor of three or so.<br>
Another fine example of why Enteract is so highly regarded.

Thank you for your response to my request for service.  I was able to
connect to the WW web through EnterAct today without difficulty.
The online instructions for setting up the Windows NT 4.0 Dialer were
excellent.  Too bad Microsoft doesn't have the same level of customer
support. I think I am going to like the service your company provides.

I had decided that it was high time that I took the time to send a
very overdo  thank you to all the staff at Enteract.  I had brought
someone I know to my office to show enteract to him as they say a
picture is worth a thousand words at which time he asked another
question this one I could not answer so I picked up the phone and
called  Enteract to get the answer and he was so amazed that you
answered the phone after only a couple of rings that right then and
there he decided to switch to a Complete Act account with Enteract. The
quality of the connection compared to what I hear from people on
different services is outstanding. I also think it is tremendous that
you are so concerned about your present customers that you stop signing
up new accounts when the  equipment starts to get pushed.<br>
Again THANK YOU one and all for the great support you provide!!!

I have been using a national ISP for V.34 dial-up access for a couple of
years now, and wanted to make the move to ISDN.  Unfortunately, this
national ISP does not have ISDN access in this area, so I began a search
for a new ISP.  I checked out chi.internet, C-Net, and others, and four
names seemed to be mentioned favorable in all areas.  Of those, three
offered ISDN access, so I check out their home pages, compared rates, and
all that.  Then I fired off an e-mail with a few specific questions.  Of
the three e-mails I sent, Charlie Ward was the first to reply (about an
hour later).  the second reply came in the next day, and the third reply
has not shown up yet!
<p>
Charlie's quick reply, and his detailed anwswers to my questions and
follow-up questions were pretty convincing.  your policy of putting a hold
on new accounts until you have the capacity to service them properly (I
simplified that, I know...) was also impressive.  To many folks are glad to
take your money without any thought to service!
<p>
So I added my name to the list, and waited a couple of days.  When we
talked today, I was pleasantly surprised that you were able to setup my
account right away!  Charlie had written that it would only take a few
minutes, but to actually be up and running within 15 mintues of my phone
call was great!

A very special shout out to Mark Delsing, an employee of EnterAct who did
some legwork for me to get information passed on as to passwords, FAQs, and
other necessary tidbits.
<p>
In all seriousness, though, EnterAct really *is* the most customer-focused
Internet provider in the city.  I do recommend them all the time to people
looking to go online or for a new provider because they're cheap price-wise,
but the customer service operations are a step above and beyond the rest.  I
worked at another Chicago Internet provider for a year, and trust me,
EnterAct beats them hand over fist.

Of the eight ISP/Online services I've worked with on both personal and 
professional levels over 10 years of being online (four local ISP's and 
four national services) I have been 110% satisfied with EnterAct.  Yes I've 
encountered minor technical problems with them, I also had them with the 
other firms and often much more annoying issues.  Coming from a technical 
field though, I understand and expect it, nobody's perfect.  However their customer
service and response time to issues is by far what makes them stand out
from the crowd.  I've been very pleased with how they've handled my
account from day one and recommend them to anyone looking for Internet
services.

We are a new client to your service, having been an AOL user
for years.  We have been very impressed with your attention to the needs
of your customers.  We were not able to enroll when we first called
because you were not taking additional customers.  That in itself gave
us an indication that this was a business in capable hands.  You seem
more concerned about providing a quality service than simply growing
without regard to the effect on service.  Keep up the great work.  We
really like the service.

Enteract reminds me of SATURN,  a new company that knows how to treat
people.  Keep up the great work,  I feel sorry for the folks 
that complain about ISP's and don't know places like Enteract really do
exist.  
<p>
Before the Big "E",  I had one of the big national ISP's, and I felt just 
like the folks on AOL.  Those big companies are making the bucks and 
have no idea the goose isn't going to
keep laying golden eggs for them, unless they start treating their
customers like they'd like to be treated, if they were on our end.
Enteract has told me about more situations that MAY, but never did
affect me, while AOL tried to deny, and lie about problems, I had to
provide dates, and times to get credit. Netcom was the same.
<p>
Now, I get regular information provided by the Big "E", not just a
glitzy monthly PR letter to its members.  And the idea of getting 30
hours MINNIMUM a month, or they credit my account  per hour not used is
incredible.  Having a dial-up number in my local calling area, is like
having my own company, to use when I want, if I want, and it's there
whenever needed.  Sure, Enteract's been growing, and in about 6 months,
perhaps 150 connections, I've had to redial 3, 4, maybe 5 times; but I
always got through, and with only one dial-up number on record.  To just
hear Enteract put a hold on new subscribers, until Enteract could
maintain the same level of service for all its customers is fantastic,
unbelievable actually; at least I think so.   A couple hundred thousand
"AOL wanna be surfers" would probably have given a handsome startup fee
for that kind of service, I know I would have.  Enteract is one of the
greatest, if not the greatest, ISP any surfer could hope to have as
their carrier.

I want to tell you that all I heard about your company is <b>true</b>.
I had heard that I would be treated nicely and all my questions would be

I've been following this news-server 'crisis' closely, and I can't imagine
a more professional way of handling things.  You keep us updated on what's

I'm very glad to have you working on these things and keeping us informed

I have been setting folks up with internet accounts
lately, and switched to your service entirely.  I'm glad to see the recent
hold on new accounts has been lifted.  But, in light of the AOL fiasco,

Jennifer and Tracy:

<p>Can I just say a huge "thank you" to you two?  I think I will.  Thank
you. :) 
As I said in my first post... if I were left in the dark about what was going
on, chances are I wouldn't be too pleased.  But knowing that people <b>are
working</b> on the problem, <b>are aware</b> of it, and are doing their
best to fix
it... that makes the difference.  (Can you guess what happened at another ISP
I was at?  ;)  But anyway...)

<p>I very much appreciate all the time everyone has put in to making sure
customers have net access.  With this kind of devotion, along with the fact
that I <b>always</b> talk to a real, live person when I call, it's little
wonder
you folks are #1.

<p>Put that in the testimonials page ;)

<p>Dear All

<p>I am writing to thank you for providing such an excellent Internet
access service.

<p>Since moving my service over in February I can only praise the hard work
and dedication you all have to make your service a success.

<p>I can also only commend the speed and efficiency with which you deal
with the occasional problem that springs up and it is a pleasure to do
business with a company who focus so highly on customer service and
satisfaction.

<p>I confidently provide your name to any and all people who ask me for a
great Internet provider.

<p>Please keep up the good work.

<p align=right>Best wishes and thanks

<p>Hi Gang!

<p>Thank you again for your kind help and wonderful service!

<p>I must say that EnterAct is by far the most customer conscious and
personal of ISPs in the area. You never fail to amaze me how quickly you
respond to any question that I may have, be it network or software related.
And the welcome feeling I get from everybody there is just an added bonus!

<p>I hope that in the next couple months I can upgrade my service to a
CompleteAct account.

<p>To all of you at EnterAct - and especially Jessica,

<p>I recently had to create my home page as a school assignment. I
couldn't quite figure out how to up load it, so I called tech support.
Jessica was <strong>GREAT!!!</strong>    Although I didn't know what I was
doing - <em>she</em>
obviously did. I had a couple of errors in the HTML text and she located
them and then told me how to fix them and waited until she could see that I
had fixed them!  What patience!
 
<p>Every time I have had to contact you all - I have received instant help 
- in a professional, friendly manner.
 
<p>After experiences that I have had with other Internet servers -
You all are a breathe of fresh air!
 
<p>Thank you for the help.

<p>I just moved out of the Chicago area, and so had to switch to yet 
another provider.  But I wanted to take a minute and say thank you for 
the good service.

<p>Things weren't always perfect, but Enteract was the first provider in 
awhile to pretty much validate my faith in them.

<p>I like to complain and voice my opinion when things go wrong, and what I 
liked about Enteract was that you kept a stiff upper lip, retained your 
helpful attitude and continued to <em>genuinely</em> improve your service.  
Improvement did not appear to be something to which you paid "lip" 
service.

<p>So, I therefore wish you the best.  I don't know how you will meet the 
challenges to come, expanding beyond Chicago, faster types of service, 
innovative new weird Internet stuff, etc., but I think you'll be Ok.

<p align=right>Sincerely,

<p>I wanted to say thank u to Jessica for helping me get online with 
Enteract and to set up an easy account that I can live with. I was so sick 
of being swindled by other online companies ... If u are 
reading this and not a member just give this service a try. Again I wanted 
to say thank u Jessica.

<p align=right>Have a nice day
<br><font color="#8c1010">Michael Harris</font>

<p>P.S. and the service people aren't cranky either</p>

<hr>

<p>Hi,
<br>I'd like to thank Jessica for the time she spent on the phone with me 
working out the number of problems I was having getting my client 
on-line. She communicated effectively and was able to resolve our 
problems quickly. All in all, my client is extremely happy and, 
therefore, so am I. 
<p align=right>Keep up the good work,

<p>The Folks at EnterAct,
<br>I would like to thank Charlie, Dan, Kenny, and Mike for all of 
their help the last two days trying to get my windows 95 setup correct.  You 
don't see this kind of patience too often these days from a service company.
<br>Thanks again!

<p>Nobody I talked with (you, Tracy, and some nice woman that 
answers sometimes) has ever been short.  In fact, I have been telling my 
friends to sign up with you guys because "everyone there is so friendly 
and helpful.  They don't make you feel like an idiot when you don't know 
what a shell account is, or an FTP or any of those other letters we novices 
can't figure out."

<p>While the vast majority of ISP's treat their customers no better than
America Online does - restricting their access to such powerful tools
as Perl and CGI scripting, while bragging about their "unrestricted
access" to the Internet - it's nice to find an outlet like EnterAct.
They not only allow such experimentation, they actually <em>encourage</em>
it, all the while providing superb and speedy technical support.
Thanks, guys, for a great place to hang my virtual hat.

<p>Looking forward to getting my site up on the "Web" and glad 
I made the switch to EnterAct. You're not the first 
ISP I've tried, and you may not be the biggest in this area (yet), but 
for sure, you're the most friendly I've 
come across and the first to realize you're in a "service" business. 

<p>In this day and age when customers are all but taken for granted and 
enduring long-winded automated phone 
systems and endless waits on hold is commonplace, it's refreshing to hear 
a real live person answer the phone 
in two or three rings, every time. Every person I talked with answered 
ALL my questions, including the dumb 
ones, without making me feel stupid or sounding like they're doing me a 
favor. Keep up the good work!</p>

<p>You Go Guys!!
<br>As a new user converting from Microsoft Network and running both 
parallel, I
have to tell you that you have been 100% available. Sadly, the same can't be
said for MSN... 
<br>Appreciate the excellent service to date. Look forward to many hours of
uncompromised computer usage with Enteract.

<p align=right>Thanks,

<p>I want to thank Michael, Tracy, Tom and Jim for the great work in 
relocating Essential Presence and my clients to EnterAct virtual Web servers.

<p>Bearing the scars to too many lost skirmishes on the ISP/virtual host front,
I had serious concerns about being able to move five domains seamlessly from
one host to another, but you did it in the promised 24 hours.  Not only
that, but you resolved both the expected and the unexpected glitches on the
fly, and promptly and patiently answered all my questions along the way.

<p>I was particularly impressed by your willingness to spend all the time I
required to meet face-to-face before making the move.  My livelihood depends
of the capabilities and reliability of the hosting service I use, and while
my needs may not be unusual, they aren't standard either.  Being able to sit
down with you to learn how you could fulfill them went a long way toward
helping me make this change with confidence.

<p>The quality of your dial-up service was an unexpected, and highly
appreciated, bonus.  After months of RNAs, dead connections, dropped
connections and less than optimal connect speeds, my EnterAct dial-up is a
giddy pleasure.  Not only do I connect - and stay connected - first try, but
file transfers and Web connections are much faster than my other accounts.

<p>All told, this is the first time I've had a completely positive startup
experience with an ISP or virtual hosting service.  Try as I might, I have
no complaints, and I'm looking forward to a long-term, mutually beneficial
relationship between EnterAct and Essential Presence.

<p>Well, it almost seemed impossible, but it works.  Thanks to Jim.
Thanks again.

<hr>

<p>You guys are doing an outstanding job!  I am delighted to refer 
customers to you -- which is something I haven't been able to say about 
an ISP in over a year.

<p>I just wanted to take a minute to say how pleased I am with the
service and support I have received from EnterAct.  This is a first-class 
operation.  I've called several times with problems (none of which were 
EnterAct's fault) and the tech support was friendly, understanding, and 
most importantly, competent.  While I am sure everyone at EnterAct 
deserves a hearty round of applause, I would like to specifically 
mention Mike Cloran, Jim Dreher, and Tracy Snell. These gentlemen have 
helped me get this thing going, and their assistance is very much 
appreciated.  Keep up the good work, and AOL and CompuServe are gonna 
get a run for the money.

<p>P.S. I will be telling my friends to call you.

<p align=right><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Verbal</FONT></p>

<hr>

<p>I just dialed in again to EnterAct to see if you got back to me already
(I can't believe you did. You guys are so much better than <b>XXX</b>) and 
this time it's working fine. Weird. I guess we can just chalk it 
up to a weird Win95 problem (I love blaming MS!).

<p align=right><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Scott</FONT></p>

<p>"Thank you for helping out with the temporary access. I spent a week on a
business trip in Chicago and I wanted to demonstrate to friends and relatives
some of the awesome activities one can enjoy on the net. I found your service
very impressive compared to some Los Angeles area providers I have tried
before. I had no busy signals, disconnects and the line speed was great
constantly unlike some of the providers where it fluctuates significantly
throughout the day. We had a lot of fun testing some of the recent Internet
phone applications with excellent results. I will be discussing the purchase
of a computer for/with my parents in the near future and I don't see a reason
the shop further for any other provider."

<hr>

<p>I wanted to compliment you/your company on a great experience so far.
<br>I've dialed up at what I suspect are peak times, evenings and Saturday
afternoons, and never had any difficulty getting a connection.  I seem to
be able to get everywhere I want to go quickly and easily.
<br>Thanks for your help and great service!

<p>I love EnterAct, but I've been too busy surfing to write and tell
you.  Great service guys!

<p align=right><FONT COLOR="#8c1010">Bob Burman</FONT></p>

<hr>

<p>Keep up the great work.  Over the years, I've had a number of 
different Internet providers, and I've never felt as positive about a 
provider as I have about EnterAct.

<p>"Enteract:  Simply the finest Internet service provider in the known 
universe." No, no -- too gushing.

<p>"Enteract -- the name says it all." Nooo -- too snappy.

<p>"It's cheap, it works, and the boys in tech know everything."
Hmmm. Now we're cookin' ...

<p>Really.  They know the answers to all my questions, and I've got a 
million of 'em. 
<br>They 
hooked me up no problem, and they know where all the cool links are, and the
response 
time -- Hey, if Enteract was a car, it'd be a Porsche.  I signed up for a year.  
Well, I'm going to. All right, all right, I'll send in the form.

<p>I was very pleased with the service and help which I was given by 
EnterAct. I had called and wished to gain access to their services.  
Tracy at EnterAct asked me some questions about my computer. He then 
walked me thru the setup procedure and made sure that I had access to 
their services, before he helped anyone else. He even helped me do my 
first FTP over the net while he was on the telephone. I was amazed that 
companies like this still existed in todays times, I thought that they 
had all disappeared. He made me feel like I was the most important 
customer they ever had. I would and have recommended other users to call 
EnterAct because that's where the REAL PROFESSIONALS ARE!

<p>Since June, 1995 I have tried three of the "best" ISPs in Chicago. I 
guess it took the fourth try to make it right! I can't believe how clean 
and fast your connections are! And I can't believe how well you folks 
respond to support type issues!

<p>"When I first asked for information (when searching again for a new ISP) 
you were the first one of the few to write back. Then set-up was so easy, 
no dickering about checks and payments, you just answered all my 
questions, took my credit card info and set up my account.

<p>You folks are *great!*

<p>Well, I called you only about 24 hours ago, and so far, I'm impressed.
As I mentioned on the phone, my previous experience with an Internet
Service Provider was less than spectacular.  After four weeks, several
voice mail messages left, paging attempts, and e-mails, I still hadn't
heard a word from them.  What a way to run a business.

<p>You got me set up in minutes.  I got home, entered the parameters
you gave me into Win 95, and managed to log on successfully.  Amazing.  Just
thought I'd let you know I appreciate your way of doing business.  Keep
up the good work - I hope things work out for you and the business does
well.

<p>Jim, got your voice-mail today and you're VERY welcome for converting 
to an annual account.  I recommend you guys to everyone I know.  
And I have a link to your home page on both my web pages.  You guys 
are great!

<p><b>Part Two:</b>
<br>Hey guys.  I really like the Usage page.  Very helpful info.  I guess 
signing up for an annual account is already paying off in my case 
huh?  I'm SOOOOOOO glad I am not paying AOL rates anymore...  
$2.95 an hour.  Puhlease!  Keep the awesome stuff coming. I sure 
appreciate it.

<p>While browsing the <a href="news:chi.internet">chi.internet</a> 
newsgroup I saw several postings mentioning enteract.com in response to 
pleas for recommendations for good Internet Service.  It is good to see 
such nice things written about your service.  I can also now attest to 
the fact that you will <b>go out of your way</b> to help.

<p>You guys rock. I'm telling friends and switching my parents over! :)
<br>...enough griping about other ISPs here, now that I seem to have 
entered the promised land!

<p>Testimonial: "I asked if they had my favorite newsreader, tin, and they 
said
they would install it. A few hours later, I received an email saying it was 
installed, and I was running tin soon thereafter! These guys are great! I've 
never seen service of such awesome speed on any ISP! I'll definitely be 
telling my friends about this!"

Well, I wanted to say thanks again for all of your help and support the
past year. I am not speaking solely of your generosity - but of everything
(support wise).  Wny no other ISP can figure out what Enteract has is
pretty amazing, but I am sure you guys won't lose sleep over it.</p>
<p>
Your support and service is NOT standard - although you probably
don't get enough compliments on it.  Let me know your thoughts... and of
course, have a GREAT holiday.

Well, this is just a little of what people have to say about us. And 
no, we haven't stacked the deck!  You should see the testimonial my mom 
wrote .... but the guys wouldn't let me put it up here because that would 
be unfair!  All of these testimonials are from new customers.
<p>We hope you give us a chance to publish your testimonial here ... try us
out!
