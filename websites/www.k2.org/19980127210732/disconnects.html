<p><li><b><a name="callwaiting">Call waiting:</a></b> A common cause of a 
modem disconnection 
is call-waiting. If you have call-waiting active and your connection 
freezes up for a period of time, or you are disconnected suddenly and the 
phone starts ringing, this the most likely culprit of your problems. It is 
possible to deactivate call-waiting for outgoing phone calls by dialing 
"<code>*70</code>" before dialing a number. If you wish to reconfigure your 
computer to disable call-waiting, you can enter "<code>*70,</code>" at the 
beginning of your phone number. For example, if you normally entered 
"<code>4420001</code>" as your phone number, you could instead enter 
"<code>*70,4420001</code>". If you configure your script manually, 
your dial string would read;
<br><code>ATDT*70,4420001</code>

<p><li><b><a name="timeout">EnterAct's 20 minute inactivity 
timeout:</a></b> If you leave 
your connection unused for 20 minutes or more, our terminal server will 
disconnect the line. We do this to keep time charges from adding up on 
your account, in case you leave your computer connected while you go on 
to doing something else. Say you set to download a large file and want to 
get some shut-eye, you don't really want to pay for connection time 
straight through the night right?

<p><li><b><a name="internaltimeout">Other inactivity timeouts:</a></b> In 
addition to EnterAct's 
own inactivity timeout, your connection software may have an inactivity 
timeout of it's own. For example, <i>Netscape Navigator Personal 
Edition</i> has it's own default timeout of 5 minutes. You can consult your 
software's documentation to correct this if you suspect it to be the 
problem, and you can call us as well and we will do what we can to help you.

<p><li><b><a name="linenoise">Line noise:</a></b> Line noise is perhaps the 
most difficult of 
these problems to solve. When you place a telephone call the data, be it 
your email 
or your voice, is transferred through different exchanges within the phone 
company and eventually routed to us. Anywhere along the way something can 
cause line noise, which is characterized by the sound of static, or 
intermittent popping, which you might hear when your modem is dialing in. 
We're working very hard testing the quality of our phone lines, but we 
can only test so far. If you suspect line noise to be the cause of 
disconnections, please give us a call at (773) 248-8511 so that we can 
contact the phone company and otherwise investigate the situation.

<p><li><b><a name="configs">Configuration problems:</a></b> The 
configuration of your 
communications software may also cause problems with your connection. A 
few of the things that you can double-check are that you have hardware 
handshaking active, or set to CTS/RTS. This ensures that communication 
between your computer and your modem are properly regulated. As well, you 
should avoid selecting any option that says "Connect at this speed only" 
which may force certain modems to disconnect under noisy conditions 
rather than change to a slower speed. NOTE: Simply unsetting this option 
in Windows95 is not sufficient, you should delete and re-install the 
driver in question. 

<p><li><b><a name="overflow">Communications overflow:</a></b> If you are 
using an older computer, it may be 
possible that your computer is incapable of handling higher speed 
connections, in which case you might try lowering your transmission 
rate, or DTE settings. <a 
href="http://www.teleport.com/~curt/modems.html#uarts">It may be possible to 
upgrade your computer's UART chip</a> to handle the speeds of modern 
high-speed modems.

<p><li><b><a name="buffer">Buffer size:</a></b> By reducing your transfer 
buffer size under Windows95, you can improve communications reliability. 
To decrease this buffer size, go to the "Modems" control panel. Select 
your modem and go in to Properties. On the Connection page is a button 
for Port Settings ... select this and slide the sliders in the pop-up 
window over to the left some. Say "OK" a bunch of times and hopefully 
you'll have a more reliable connection.

<p><li><b><a name="modems">Modems:</a></b> Some modems have design problems 
that cause them to among other problems,
sometimes drop connections. If you have a modem that you suspect 
might have some internal trouble, you can contact the manufacturer 
directly, or you might contact us as well to see if we know of any 
problems we've heard of with your particular model. Some problems we've 
found include;
<ul>
<li>Some earlier USR Sportster modems have shipped with bad ROMs in them. 
These can be replaced through US Robotics for better reliability. US 
Robotics Technical Support can be contacted at (847)982-5151 or by 
emailing <a href="mailto:support@usr.com">support@usr.com</a>.
<li>PCMCIA modems, especially earlier models, have shown a tendency to 
overheat. This problem will result in bad performance after the modem has 
been in use for some amount of time. This problem can be alleviated by 
providing better ventilation (cooling) to the area, and by contacting the 
manufacturer.
</ul>

<p><li><b><a name="digital">Digital lines:</a></b> If you are using a 
digital line, it may have a damaged relay or SCR. If you suspect this may 
be a problem, contact your phone company or other professional for support.

<p><li><b><a name="pbx">PBX systems:</a></b> If you are 
experiencing problems when connecting to 
EnterAct through a PBX or similar such system frequently 
used in office environments, it may be that the this equipment is 
adversely affecting your modem's line quality. The more switches and relays 
and equipment on the line that you are using, the more opportunities 
there are for potential connection problems and line noise. If you 
suspect that your internal phone system may be causing problems, try 
testing your set up on a standard line if you can. Ideally, your data 
communications should go through dedicated lines and not through office 
switching equipment.
