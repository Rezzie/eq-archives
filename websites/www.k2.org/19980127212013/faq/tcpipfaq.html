<P><h3><b>Use the Most Current Version Possible</b></h3>

Older versions of Open Transport (anything before O/T 1.11) have been
known to have various problems which could cause many woes connecting
and staying connected reliably.

Click the dialog box that says "Configure Using PPP Server". If you see
more than one instance of "PPP Server" you have more than one PPP driver
installed.  You will need to go to your extensions folder and remove any
additional ones you have.
