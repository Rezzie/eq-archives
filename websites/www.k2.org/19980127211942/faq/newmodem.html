<p><h3>Slow Connections</h3>
<font color=#000000>
<p><b>Getting 28.8 or 33.6 Connects</b><p>
Depending on your phone line quality, you may not achieve 28.8 connect speeds, much 
less 33.6 connections.  26.4 connections are very common and probably won't adversely
affect throughput very much.  To try to improve your connect speed, try using a 
different phone number on a different system (for example, if you're using a digital 
number currently, try an analog number). For a complete list of our numbers click 
<a href="http://www.enteract.com/where.html">here</a>.  You can also try
changing your modem's initialization string (see the section on Initialization
Strings for more information).  
<p>
For even more information about connect speeds, please see the following pages:

FAQ</a>
</ul>

Lastly, contact the phone company to see if 
there are any problems with your phone line that can be corrected.

<p><b>Initialization Strings</b><p>
Many times, simply changing the initialization string that your modem uses
can improve your connection.  Some basic strings to try are <font color=#bb0000>
ATZ</font>, <font color=#bb0000>AT&F</font>, or <font color=#bb0000>AT&F1</font>. 
If you know the brand and model of your modem, you should consult your modem's 
manual or the manufacturer.  You can also check out the following web sites:

<p><h3>Modem Disconnections</h3></a>
<font color=#000000>
<p>

<b>Call waiting</b> <p>
A common cause of a modem disconnection is call-waiting. If your connection 
freezes up for a period of time, or you are disconnected suddenly and the 
phone starts ringing, you probably did not turn off your call-waiting.  It is 
possible to deactivate call-waiting for outgoing phone calls by dialing 
<font color=#bb0000>*70</font> or <font color=#bb0000>1170,</font> before dialing a number. 

<p><b>EnterAct's 20 minute inactivity timeout</b><p> 
If you leave your connection idle for 20 minutes, our terminal server will 
disconnect the line. We do this to keep time charges from adding up on 
your account in case you leave your computer connected while you go on 
to doing something else.  Idle time is any time when you are not actively using
your connection.  Any packet activity (i.e. downloading, retrieving mail, accessing
a web page) is considered active use of your connection and you will not be 
disconnected.  

<p><b>Other inactivity timeouts</b> <p>
In addition to EnterAct's own inactivity timeout, your connection software 
may have an inactivity timeout of it's own. For example, <i>Netscape Navigator Personal 
Edition</i> has its own default timeout of 5 minutes.  You can consult your 
software's documentation to correct this if you suspect it to be the 
problem.  

<p><b>Line noise</b> <p>
Line noise is perhaps the most difficult of 
these problems to solve. When you place a telephone call, the data, be it 
your email or your voice, is transferred through different exchanges within the phone 
company and eventually routed to us. Anywhere along the way something can 
cause line noise, which is characterized by the sound of static, or 
intermittent popping, which you might hear when your modem is dialing in. 
We're working very hard to test the quality of our phone lines, but we 
can only test so far.  There is a great page on the web that can help you
figure out if you have noisy lines or not.  Go 
<a href="http://www.ascend.com/service/technotes/line_QA.html" target="_top">
here</a> to learn more.  If you suspect that line noise is a problem, you should
contact your phone company to test your lines.  

<p><b>Configuration problems</b> <p>
The configuration of your 
communications software may also cause problems with your connection. A 
few of the things that you can double-check are that you have hardware 
handshaking active, or set to CTS/RTS. This ensures that communication 
between your computer and your modem are properly regulated. You 
should also avoid selecting any option that says "Connect at this speed only" 
which may force certain modems to disconnect under noisy conditions 
rather than change to a slower speed. 

<p><b>Communications overflow</b> <p>
If you are using an older computer, it may be 
possible that your computer is incapable of handling higher speed 
connections.  You might try lowering your baud rate.   
<a href="http://www.teleport.com/~curt/modems.html#uarts" target="_top">It may be possible to 
upgrade your computer's UART chip</a> to handle the speeds of modern 
high-speed modems.

<p><b>Buffer size</b> <p>
By reducing your transfer 
buffer size under Windows95, you can improve communications reliability. 
To decrease this buffer size, go to the "Modems" control panel. Select 
your modem and go to Properties. On the Connection page is a button 
for Port Settings.  Select this and slide the sliders in the pop-up 
window over to the left one notch. 

<p><b>Modems</b> <p>
Some modems have design problems which can
sometimes drop connections. If you have a modem that you suspect 
might have some internal trouble, you can contact the manufacturer 
directly, or you might contact us as well to see if we know of any 
problems we've heard of with your particular model. Some problems we've 
found include;
<ul>
<li>Some earlier USR Sportster modems have shipped with bad ROMs in them. 
These can be replaced through US Robotics for better reliability. US 
Robotics Technical Support can be contacted at (847)982-5151 or by 
emailing <a href="mailto:support@usr.com">support@usr.com</a>.
<li>PCMCIA modems, especially earlier models, have shown a tendency to 
overheat. This problem will result in bad performance after the modem has 
been in use for some amount of time. This problem can be alleviated by 
providing better ventilation (cooling) to the area, and by contacting the 
manufacturer.
</ul>

<p><b>Digital lines</b> <p> 
If you are using a 
digital line, it may have a damaged relay or SCR. If you suspect this may 
be a problem, contact your phone company or other professional for support.

<p><b>PBX systems</b> <p>
If you are 
experiencing problems when connecting to 
EnterAct through a PBX or similar system frequently 
used in office environments, it may be that this equipment is 
adversely affecting your modem's line quality. The more switches, relays, 
and equipment on the line that you are using, the more opportunities 
there are for potential connection problems and line noise. If you 
suspect that your internal phone system may be causing problems, try 
testing your setup on a standard line if you can. Ideally, your data 
communications should go through dedicated lines and not through office 
switching equipment.
