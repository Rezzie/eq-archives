<H2>Setting up a web page in 15 minutes</H2>


<i>If you don't want to hear the rationale behind the subscriber page index system,
you can <a href="#Info">cut to the chase</a>.</i><p>

EnterAct maintains a list of all our subscriber's home pages; this list is (as you've
probably noticed) accessible as a link from our home page.<i>We want to encourage all of
our subscribers who have something to say to publish themselves</i> on the World Wide Web, 
and we think one of the best ways to promote the use of the World Wide Web is to <i>
make our user pages as visible and interesting as possible.</i><p>

It's been our experience that most "lists of subscriber home pages" maintained at ISPs are
fairly <i>pointless and boring</i>. What's interesting about a list of names belonging to 
strangers? Why would anyone click your on <i>your</i> link instead of someone else's? The 
best you can hope for with mundane subscriber home page lists is that someone will happen
upon your page by chance, randomly clicking on names.<p>

<i>If you've gone through the effort of creating a presence for yourself on the World Wide 
Web, we think people should know about it.</i> If your page is dedicated to a specific topic,
that fact should be represented in the list of home pages, hopefully catching the eyes of 
people interested in that topic and <i>increasing the exposure of your page.</i><p>

<i>To that end, we've implemented what we think is the spiffiest subscriber home page index 
in Chicago.</i> Like most providers, we've set up programs to automatically scan the system 
for subscriber home pages. Unlike (as far as we know) most providers, we've set our programs 
up to gather additional information about those pages, based on information given by our 
subscribers. We allow our subscribers to customize the appearance of their entry in the 
home page directory by specifying an "icon" GIF representative (or not) of their WWW presence. 
Our subscribers can change the way their name will appear in the home page list. And most 
importantly, <i>subscribers can provide a description of the content of their home page,
giving the rest of the world a reason to click on the page.</i><p>

We're <i>constantly</i> searching for new ways to distinguish our presence (and, as a 
consequence, our subscribers) from the rest of the net. If you can think of a way for us to 
do that, <i><a href="mailto:support@enteract.com">please, please tell us about it</a></i>.<p>

<a name="Info">

</a>

<i>If you already know how home pages work at EnterAct, and just want to know how the
suscriber index features work, you can <a href="#Features">skip most of this</a></i>.

User pages at EnterAct should be placed in the <pre>public_html</pre> directory under
your home directory. If one of your pages is named <pre>index.html</pre> or  if you're 
using <a href="http://web.sau.edu/~mkruse/www/info/ssi.html">Server Side Includes</a>, 
<pre>index.shtml</pre> that page is accessible with the URL <pre>
http://www.enteract.com/~name/</pre> This is the preferred way of making your page
available - otherwise, people looking for your page need to know the name of the
file containing your home page.<p>

<b>THE PAGES MUST BE "READABLE"</b> to be accessible. Our web pages are served off of a
Unix machine; Unix enforces "permissions" on files, allowing you to set aside files that
can only be read or modified by you. <b>If your HTML documents are not "world readable", 
they will not be accessible</b>. Likewise, your directories need to be flagged "executable" 
for the pages to be accessible.<p>

If you're unsure of whether your pages are appropriately configured, log on to the shell 
machine (adam.enteract.com) and enter the following Unix commands:<br>
<pre>chmod 711 public_html
cd public_html
chmod 755 *
</pre><p>

<a name="Features">Our subscriber index</a> system allows you to customize your entry
on the "List of EnterAct subscribers" page by specifying a description of your page, as well
as determining the way you'd like your name to appear in the list. If you'd rather your page
didn't show up in our index of pages, you can flag your page private as well. Additionally,
you can set up a small "icon" image that will be shown along with your name and page 
information.<p>

Information about your page is stored in a file in your public_html directory 
called <b>.info</b> Most of the time, files beginning with the "." character don't show up 
in directory listings on Unix systems, so don't freak out if you create the file and can't 
find it. It's probably there. Like everything else in your public_html directory, the file 
needs to be flagged readable... you can accomplish this by typing <pre>chmod a+r .info</pre><p>

The info file is formatted much like an HTML document. Each feature is configured by a "tag", 
which is specified between angle brackets ("&LT" and "&GT"). The description of your home page 
should be indicated with the &LTdescription> tag; the description should be terminated with a 
&LT/description> tag. Everything in between those two tags is the description of your home 
page, and will appear in the home page index.<p>

<i><b>Please do not use HTML in your description</b></i>... making mistakes in the HTML 
can screw up the entire page.<p>

An example of a description entry would be:<br>
&LTdescription>This is my home page; click here for information about computer security,
cryptography, and an extensive collection of links regarding "Schoolhouse Rock"&LT/description>
<p>

If you specify a &LTname> tag (closed by a &LT/name> tag), everything in between the tags
will specify your name on the page. This'd be a decent place to stick your email address, if
you'd like it visible to the whole world.<p>

An example of a name entry would be:<br>
&LTname>Thomas Ptacek, tqbf@enteract.com&LT/name>
<p>

Everything within the name tag is going to be "hot" (clicking on it will send you to your home 
page), so keep it brief.<p>

Finally, if you want to prevent your page from being indexed at all, add a &LTprivate> tag
anywhere in the .info file. If you'd rather something other than "index.html" be referenced 
from your home page, the indexing program will look for "welcome.html" as well.

If you'd like a small image to appear by your name in the subscriber index, place a GIF file 
in your public_html directory and call it (this is case-sensitive) <pre>icon.gif</pre> Make 
sure it's readable. <i>The image must be less than 100x100 pixels in size, or it will not
show up on the home page index</i>.<p>
