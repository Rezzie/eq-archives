<p>Welcome to Second Chance Orphanage! We are so glad you visited our homepage. Second
Chance Orphanage is a special place for abandoned Cabbage Patch Kids. Our Kids have all
had failed first adoptions and are looking for new parents to love them. At Second Chance,
they are fed, bathed, given new clothes if needed, assigned a new name, and given a place
to sleep, play, and have fun until a new parent comes for them. </p>

<p>Each Kid also receives a full physical exam from our resident doctor. Any Kids that
need &quot;surgery&quot; are taken directly from their bath to the hospital ward, where
they have joints, fingers, and toes resewn if needed. When they are adopted, they carry
with them the Second Chance adoption certificate, and if they spent time in the hospital
ward they also leave with their dated medical record stating what kind of operation was
performed. If their &quot;boo-boos&quot; are permanent (ink marks, scars, etc.), another
medical record is issued. We at Second Chance feel that just because some Kids have
permanent marks on them, it in no way hinders their ability to give lots of love and
comfort to their parents. </p>

<p>The following pages contain lists of the Kids who are waiting for adoptive parents.
They are all makes, faces, colors, and sizes. There is a small adoption fee for each Kid,
usually between $8.00-$20.00 (see the <a HREF="orders.html">order page</a> for more
information). If you see anyone you think you might like to adopt, let us know. They
promise to be good, make their beds, pick up their clothes and toys, eat everything on
their plates, and never, EVER, tell anyone your secrets! Feel free to contact us if you
would like more information on a particular Kid--we will be glad to answer any questions
you have. </p>
