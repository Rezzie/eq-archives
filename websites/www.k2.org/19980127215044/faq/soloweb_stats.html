<h1>How do I get my web stats?</h1>
</center>
<hr width=55%>
<br>
Once upon a time, you could search through the main httpd access_log
to find the entries corresponding to your page.  However, to protect
the privacy of our fellow customers, we've decided to do this for you.
(It also saves you the bother).

<p>

If you'd like to see how many hits your home page is getting, check
out the directory <font color="#000000"><tt>~/web_logs</tt></font>
<p>

Each SoloAct customer with a home page gets a weekly statistics
summary of all access to their web page, as well as all raw log files
apropos their page.  The files will appear in your ~/web_logs directory
around 3:30am on Saturday mornings if there was any traffic to your site
in the past week.

<p>


Your raw access log file will look something like this:

<font color="#000000"><pre>
dialin_6.enteract.com - - [12/Jul/1996:02:38:08 -0500] "GET /~foo/ HTTP/1.0" 200 2027
dialin_6.enteract.com - - [12/Jul/1996:07:34:50 -0500] "GET /~foo/foo.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 3500
gw.att.com - - [12/Jul/1996:07:57:35 -0500] "GET /~foo/foo.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 3500
</pre></font>

The access_log lists every individual retrieval of a page in your web
space.  The requesting host, time, file request, status code and file size
(respectively) are logged.

<p>

The file <font color="#000000">stats-mm-dd-yy.html</font> 
contains the results of running the log analyzer program "analog" on
your access log.  It is formatted in HTML.  If you want to see it in
your web browser, copy it to your public_html directory and change the
permissions so that it is readable by everyone <font
color="#000000"><tt>chmod a+r stats-&lt;date&gt;.html</tt></font> (or
FTP it to your home computer) and fire it up in your web browser.

stats-&lt;date&gt; will look something like this:

<pre><font color="#000000">
[...some header material...]
<b>Total completed requests:</b> 23
<b>Average completed requests per day:</b> 7
<b>Total failed requests:</b> 1
<b>Number of distinct hosts served:</b> 6
<b>Total data transferred:</b> 135 455 bytes
<b>Average data transferred per day:</b> 43 981 bytes
[...Followed by listings of your more popular pages, and other fun stuff...]
</font></pre>

<p>

to generate these reports, please see the <a href =
