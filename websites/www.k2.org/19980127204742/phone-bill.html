<DT>Some of you are having problems with Ameritech billing you incorrectly
for calls made to our numbers.&nbsp; If you are having problems then most
often you are charged for a Band B or Band C call when it should be a Band
A call. Band B and Band C calls are considered toll calls and you are
charged per minute, while Band A calls are considered local calls and you
are charged $0.05 per call.</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>EnterAct can not refund you for any incorrect charges on
your Ameritech phone bill, but we are working with Teleport Communications
Group and Metropolitan Fiber Systems, the providers of our telephone lines,
to make sure all numbers are being billed in the correct manner.</DT>
If you feel you are being billed incorrectly from Ameritech for calls
made to one of EnterAct's numbers then we would like to include your information
in a formal complaint to Ameritech. A complaint is being filed by TCG and
we are providing them with information from our customers in an effort
to correct this problem. EnterAct is also working on a seperate letter of
complaint to be sent to Ameritech and the appropriate government regulatory
agencies on behalf of its customers. 
<p>

<DT>EnterAct can not make any guarantees
as far as what results these letters of complaints will have. Please contact
Ameritech directly at (800) 244-4444 concerning any charges you feel are
incorrect.&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>If you would like to be included in one of the above complaints then
please fill out the form below. If you have any follow up information 
after filling out the form you may send it to:
phone-bill@enteract.com or contact Jim Dreher at (773) 248-8511.</DT>
