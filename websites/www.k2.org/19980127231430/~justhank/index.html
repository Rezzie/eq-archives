<P><STRONG>I</STRONG> am a <STRONG>H</STRONG>ank.  It happens to be my
last name.  I am a woman.  My first name is Marian, but there have always
been people who just call me <STRONG>H</STRONG>ank.  I like the name
<STRONG>H</STRONG>ank.  It's simple, it's strong, and it's mine.  For a 
time I was married and had a different
last name with a lot more letters. It never suited me as well as 
<STRONG>H</STRONG>ank did, so I got divorced.</P>


<P>
<STRONG>I</STRONG> wanted to create a homepage that would link together great minds from all over the globe.  I figured
that the easiest way to do that was to create a web that would index all the great web sites created
by <A HREF="hankwebs.html"><STRONG>H</STRONG>anks</A>.  I also have a page dedicated to the more <A HREF="hankfame.html">
famous <STRONG>H</STRONG>anks</A> and a page indexing <A
HREF="hankpet.html">Pets named <STRONG>H</STRONG>ank</A>.</P>

<P>
<STRONG>I</STRONG>n an effort to help the *rest* of the world, I am conducting the first <A HREF="suggest.html"><STRONG>H</STRONG>ank Report</A> of
<STRONG>H</STRONG>anks, because frankly there is no opinion that is quite so important.  The results are now published as they are submitted 
so that world leaders might benefit from the <A
HREF="hankdata.html">wisdom of <STRONG>H</STRONG>ank</A>.</P> 
<P>
The honorary <A HREF="hankpick.html">Websites good enough to have been done by a Hank</A>.  This page provides
links to several other name pages and sources of inspiration.  Suggestions are welcome.
</P>
<P>A very small <A HREF="hankstuff.html"><STRONG>H</STRONG>ank Stuff</A>
page is emerging.</P>

<STRONG>WISHING FOR.....</STRONG>
<P>
The <STRONG>H</STRONG>ank web could really use a neat little <STRONG>H</STRONG>ank logo.  I would love to see
it come from another <STRONG>H</STRONG>ank than myself.  Please email me (address below), if you
are interested in forwarding the cause of <STRONG>H</STRONG>anks everywhere through your artistic vision.<P>
