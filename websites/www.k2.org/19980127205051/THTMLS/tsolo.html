	EnterAct has a unique pricing plan that combines an unlimited usage account with the benefits of 'pay-as-you-go.'<BR>

	<P >With advance payment, access can cost <STRONG>as little as $21/month</STRONG> for unlimited use; even less when you use under 30 hours a month.

<STRONG>PLEASE NOTE:</STRONG>

This plan is for individual (and immediate family) use only.
There is no limit on how many hours can be used, but this is 
not a full-time, dedicated connection. The line will be 
disconnected after 20 minutes of inactivity.  Customers agree
to: keep the line only when actively using it, not use an 
automatic method to prevent inactivity disconnect, and to 
not provide any public information services over the line.
