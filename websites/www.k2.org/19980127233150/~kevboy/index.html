<hr>
<center><p>Thanks for stopping by my Web Site. I don't have any pictures, no links, no software, or anything useful for the general public. 
You will not be able to find any cool midi files, or animated gifs, or information on Meletonin here. Lacking is information about myself, the latest 
sports scores, or current stock prices. Search all you want to around my web site, and you still wont see images of beautiful bikini clad women, 
or audio clips from the latest Yanni album, or an HTML primer. There's no catchy jinggles, no computer tips, or any info on staining wood. There is a 
complete absence of data on feline urinary tract infection, or restaurant recommendations, or debates on free speech. I did't have the time to include 
useful zipping utilities, or instructions on re-jetting a Kawasaki carbarator, or opinions on proper landscaping techniques. There's a good chance you 
wont find a list of my favorite TV shows, or information on the Hubble telescope, or whether I use paper or plastic. Why then, you may ask yourself, 
are you here? Unfortunatelly, you won't find the answer for that here either.</p></center>

10. Missing the &lt; key on my keyboard.<br>
9. Think HTML stands for 'Happy Tipping Miller Lites'.<br>
8. Busy playing guitar in a John Tesh tribute band.<br>
7. Working on screen play for adult movie called 'Scrotal Recall'.<br>

5. Can't concentrate on HTML knowing Oprah's on.<br>
4. Goin to play in the NBA....or was that the NRA...or ...<br>
3. Waiting for Windows 97 to come out.<br>
2. Get goofy thinking about FTP, HTTP, HTML, TCPIP, CGI, PDQ, ASAP.<br>
