Founded in 1996, Just Cause is a not-for-profit organization comprised of 
hundreds of young volunteers committed to raising money to benefit various 
cancer causes in the Chicagoland area.  Through the funds we raise, Just
Cause assists cancer care and research in the ultimate quest for a cure.

Almost 1.4 million new cancer causes will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year.
Of all deaths in this nation, 25 percent are from cancer.  Fortunately, four out
of ten patients diagnosed with cancer this year will be alive five years from
now.

There is hope in these numbers.  There is room for more hope.  Building that
hope - by fighting cancer - is indeed a just cause.
