				<!-- INTRO TO PAGE -->

<H3>Welcome to Brian's Front Door, your site for Links, Games, Phenominal MIDI, and for a 
limited time, a small Independence Day Shrine. If you've been here before, you'll notice that 
my Independence Day Shrine was never completed and never will be because I have lost my 
obsession over that movie. I don't hate it, but I don't <I>love</I> it. Also, for those who are 
revisiting you'll notice that my chat page is gone, and at a later date will be replaced by a better 
chat possibly a JAVA chat. And a note for everyone, my page is currently under construction, 
but you will not notice it until it's finished, because I'm doing all my
renovating offline. Don't enjoy the current page too much, because soon it
will be better! <HR>

Hello my fellow surfers! I sincerely apologize for my inability 
to update these pages. Here is my agenda. I'm telling you my plans 
so you won't get "pissed" at me for not making any changes even though 
many of you probably already are. <P>

I purchaced <A HREF="http://www.metacreations.com">MetaCreations</A> 
RayDream Studio 4, and I've already ordered 5 and it's on its way. 
But, I've been playing around with that for the longest time and 
now I've gotten myself familiar with it. And I'll be creating some 
stunning graphics soon for this page. It'll be highly graphical, so 
for those people getting on with slow connections. I'm sorry :'-(  
Anyway, I purchased a book on RayDream and am learning that currently. 
I have made somewhat of a new logo for all my stuff, so that's nice. 
But I've got to update the pages and give the little "Face Lift" I've 
always wanted to do. In the meantime, I'll be making more graphics and 
will try to update this page.<P>

The first on the list is the MIDI page. I seem to be well known for this 
page and this page alone. So, I'll give the people what they want. Then 
I'll work on the Games page. I'm thinking of dropping it unless I hear 
otherwise from my "fellow surfers." The ID4 will be dropped as soon as 
I get a chance. My graphics may take up a lot. Also, I'm working on 
another page. I watch a lot of movies and decided to be somewhat of 
a critic. It's nowhere near done, but you can just check it out. It is at 
<A HREF="http://www.fortunecity.com/lavender/chelmsford/54/index.html">
http://www.fortunecity.com/lavender/chelmsford/54/index.html</A>. I have 
to make graphics for that too. So, I'm pretty booked. So, I'll make sure 
I keep you guys posted as I plan for these things. 

<P>

One more thing if I might add, I have heard of problems with Netscape not hearing my MIDI on this page. 
If you don't hear it currently, Try <A HREF="http://www.enteract.com/~cyberkil/miditest/">My
MIDI Diagnostics Page</A>. Then take it from there and I'll try and fix your problem.
