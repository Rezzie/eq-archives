<h1>Majordomo List Owner's Guide</h1><p>

<h2>Preface</h2><p>

This document explains what a majorodomo list owner/administrator
needs to do to maintain his mailing list, and the basics of how to do
it.  Most lists will not require very much work from the list owner,
but even with majordomo set up to provide as much help as an automated
program can, there's still a certain minimum of routine work
associated with each list: checking the mail generated by the program
to make sure nothing went wrong and handling the things which slip
through the cracks.<p>

We expect that a large number of people will want mailing lists, and
we do not have the resources to handle this routine work for all of
them.  Therefore, we must have a list owner/administrator for each
mailing list we create.  The person who wants the list is responsible
for finding a list owner, but need <i>not</i> be the list owner
himself; if you want a list but don't have the time to administer one,
or don't feel comfortable enough with computers to administer one, you
can find someone willing to do the list administration and jointly
request the list: you will be the "list sponsor" and the person
handling the administration duties will be the "list owner."<p>

<h2>Overview</h2><p>

This document contains the basic information you need to know to
administer a mailing list.  It explains some of the basic terms and
concepts, your responsibilities as a list owner/administrator, and the
tools we provide to simplify this task.<p>

<h2>Email and Majordomo</h2><p>

An electronic mail address (or e-mail address) is the equivalent of a
postal mail address: it is a location to send electronic mail (or
e-mail).  The e-mail address points to an electronic mailbox (or
e-mail box, or mail drop) which holds the mail.<p>

A mailing list is effectively an e-mail address which points to many
different e-mail addresses.  To be a bit more precise, an automated
process accepts mail sent to that address, processes it, and resends
it to a set list of addresses.<p>

A list owner is the person responsible for maintaining a mailing list.
Primarily what this involves is seeing that the list of addresses it
resends mail to is current.  Other responsibilities depend on the list
but can include dealing with bounced messages, approving messages sent
to the distribution address before they are resent, writing a short
description of the list, and guiding the tone or the direction of the
discussion.<p>

Majordomo is a mailing list management program.  Essentially, it's a
tool to help the list owners manage their lists.  It is designed to
handle the routine administration of mailing lists automatically,
minimizing the work the list owners need to do personally.<p>

<h2>Using Majordomo</h2><p>

People send commands to majordomo by sending mail to majordomo; to
control an ACS mailing list, you would send e-mail to
<b>majordomo@listhost.uchicago.edu</b>.  Majordomo ignores the subject
line of the messages and treats the contents of the letter as a
command -- or a series of commands, each on a separate line.<p>

Both list owners and list subscribers use majordomo.  It accepts a
large number of commands from list subscribers and executes them
automatically, so that you do not need to personally subscribe and
unsubscribe every individual, answer each request for information
about the list personally, and so on.  See our "<A
HREF="majordomo.basic.html">Majordomo for list subscribers</A>"
document for more information about what list subscribers can use
majordomo to do.  If you're offering a mailing list for a specific
group of people, for example those in a given class or department, you
should probably photocopy the document and hand it out to your
intended subscribers; the more they use majordomo, the easier your
work as a list owner will be.<p>

The list administration commands fall into four categories:
 <A HREF="#approve">subscribing and unsubscribing readers</A>,
 <A HREF="#configcommands">changing your configuration file</A>,
 <A HREF="#newinfo">changing majordomo's description of your list</A>, and
 <A HREF="#passwd">changing your password.</A><p>

Here's a basic chart; commands will be described in more detail after
it.  Wherever the chart (or the rest of this document) says
"<b><tt>listname</tt></b>", substitute the name of your list; wherever
the document says "<b><tt>password</tt></b>" substitute the password
for your list; wherever the document says, "<b><tt>address</tt></b>"
substitute the email address of the appropriate reader.<p>

<dd><A HREF="#passwd">changes your password</A> to the new password
you give </dl><p>

<h3><A NAME="approve" >The subscription commands:</A></h3><p>

There will be times when you want to subscribe or unsubscribe someone
who hasn't sent an (un)subscribe request to majordomo.  Perhaps you
want to simply subscribe everyone in your class.  Perhaps someone's
account has been deleted and he didn't send an unsubscribe request
beforehand.  You can subscribe readers by sending majordomo the
command "<b>approve <tt>password</tt> subscribe <tt>listname</tt>
<tt>address</tt></b>".  Likewise, you can unsubscribe readers by
sending majordomo the command "<b>approve <tt>password</tt>
unsubscribe <tt>listname</tt> <tt>address</tt></b>".  It is
<i>very</i> important that if you are going to subscribe someone who
hasn't sent a subscription request that you make sure you have their
correct e-mail address.  If you subscribe an e-mail address which
someone has but never reads, he won't receive your list and his unread
mail will pile up and cause problems.  Worse yet, if you subscribe an
e-mail address which is mistyped or looks right but isn't - for
example, if you include the correct Ph alias for someone who hasn't
set Ph up to forward mail - their mail will be rejected and bounced
back to the list owner, and you'll have to figure out what went wrong
and unsubscribe the address.<p>

The above command is also used when someone requests a subscription
they do not have the authorization to receive automatically.  This can
be if someone requests a subscription for another email address
(unless you have an "auto" subscription policy to let anyone subscribe
any address), or for all subscription requests if you have your list
set up so that all subscriptions require confirmation (a "closed"
subscription policy).  In either case, their mail will be forwarded to
you, with the email address for the subscription attached if they
didn't supply it.  If you add "<b>approve <tt>password</tt></b>" to
the beginning of the line (the entire line will say "<b>approve
<tt>password</tt> subscribe <tt>listname address</tt></b>") and resend
the letter to majordomo, majordomo will take their address from the
letter it forwarded to you (you must leave the letter's header intact
when you reply to majordomo, however!) and subscribe them.
Unsubscribing someone when unsubscription requires approval goes by a
similar process: they send "<b>unsubscribe <tt>listname</tt></b>" to
majordomo, majordomo sends the letter to you, you edit that line to
say "<b>approve</b> <b><tt>password</tt> unsubscribe <tt>listname
address</tt></b>."<p>

<h3><A NAME="newinfo" >The information command:</A></h3><p>

Majordomo is set up to answer some informational queries, and it can
include queries about a specific list.  The list owner can use the
newinfo command to tell the computer how to answer a general query for
information about the list. You send majordomo "<b>newinfo
<tt>listname</tt> <tt>password</tt></b>" on one line, and then type
the information you want majordomo to reply with, making sure to
include returns at the end of each line.  After the information, type
"<b><tt>END</tt></b>" on a line by itself.<p>

For example:<p>

<hr>

<tt>mail majordomo@listhost.uchicago.edu<br>

Subject:<br>

newinfo listname password<br>

This is line one of what readers see.<br>

This is line two of what readers see.<br>

This is line three of what the readers see.<br>

The next line will be blank.<br>

<br>

The previous line is blank.<br>

There could be many more lines.<br>

This is the end of the info.<br>

END</tt>

<hr><p>

The lines after end could have other commands and they would not
affect the newinfo command.<p>

Majordomo stores the information, and replies with it to general
information queries about the list -- that is, the info command.  It
also adds this information to the end of its reply to a subscription
request.<p>

The reply to an information query for the above list would say:<p>

<hr>

<tt>From: Majordomo@listhost.uchicago.edu<br>

To: eeb1@midway.uchicago.edu<br>

Subject: Majordomo results<p>

--<p>

<h3><A NAME="passwd">The password command:</A></h3><p>

The password command allows you to change your password.  Ideally, you
should change the password into something that is easy for you to
remember, but not easy for someone to guess.  It should
<i>not</i> be a word in any dictionary, including technical
dictionaries and foreign language dictionaries; there are programs
which 'guess' every word in a dictionary that's given to them.  Your
password <i>should</i> be eight characters long, and use one or more
of the following tricks: unusual characters, a mixture of letters and
numbers, or a mixture of upper-case and lower-case letters.
<i>Caution: majordomo cannot accept a pound sign (#) as a password
character.</i><p>

There are two classic tricks to choosing a password that's easy to
remember but difficult to guess.  First, you can pick a phrase and use
the first letter in every word in the phrase, picking a letter or two
to capitalize.  For example, "Start at the beginning, continue to the
end" becomes satbctte, which becomes satBcttE.  Second, you can use
misspelled words or combinations of misspelled words; you can then use
random capitalization and/or stick in numbers.  For example, Two Blue
become tuo bloo, which becomes tuo2bloo.<p>

In order to change your password, you send the command "<b>passwd
<tt>listname</tt> <tt>password</tt> newpassword</b>."  Substitute your
lists's name for "<b><tt>listname</tt></b>," your current password for
"<b><tt>password</tt></b>," and your desired new password for
"<b>newpassword</b>."<p>

<h3><A NAME="configcommands">The configuration commands:</A></h3><p>

Your configuration file controls the settings of your list: the
subscription policy, the digest policy, whose queries for information
it will answer, who can send to the list, and so on.  Unless you want
a personally-configured list, there is only one change you will need
to make to this file: setting the half-line description of your list
that will appear whenever people ask majordomo for a catalogue of its
lists.  As a whole, the configuration settings are very important and
very powerful.  They can also be very troublesome if they're set
incorrectly, so be careful.  There is a "restore to default" command,
but you should also keep a copy of your most recent configuration file
so that you won't lose any changes you have made.<p>

<A NAME="config">There are three commands controlling your
configuration file.  The first of the three commands retrieves a copy
of your current configuration file.</A> Whenever you make any change
to your configuration file, you should always send a request for a
copy, and retain the copy of your most recent configuration file, so
that if something goes wrong you can simply restore from your own
backup.  In order to receive a copy of your list's configuration file,
send majordomo a message saying, "<b>config</b>
<b><tt>listname</tt></b><b> <tt>password</tt></b>."  Majordomo will
then send a reply which includes your current configuration file.<p>

<A NAME="newconfig">The second command lets you change your
configuration file.</A>  Before you do this, you should use the config
command above to retrieve a copy of the current file.  Once you have a
copy (and made a backup copy), you edit the configuration file, and
send the new configuration file to the majordomo, prefaced by the
command "<b>newconfig <tt>listname</tt> <tt>password</tt></b>" and
ending with <tt>EOF</tt>.  It works much the same way as the newinfo
command:<p>

<hr>

<tt>mail majordomo@listhost.uchicago.edu<br>

Subject:<br>

newconfig testing-list password<br>

[Configuration file here]<br>

[Configuration file here]<br>

[Configuration file here]<br>

EOF</tt><p>

<hr>

The response will be:<p>

<tt>From: Majordomo@listhost.uchicago.edu<br>

To: tester@midway.uchicago.edu<br>

Subject: Majordomo results: newconfig<p>

--<p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; newconfig testing-list password<br>

New config for list testing-list accepted.</tt>

<hr><p>

As soon as you've changed your configuration file, you should make a
backup copy with the config command.<p>

<A NAME="writeconfig">The third command lets you go back to a previous
configuration file.</A> Thus, if you want to scrap your current
configuration file and start over, you can get an entirely new
configuration file with the writeconfig command.  If you send
majordomo the command "<b>writeconfig <tt>listname</tt>
<tt>password</tt></b>," majordomo will delete you current
configuration file and replace it with the default configuration file.
This will fix any problems your current figuration file has.  It will
also get rid of any changes you might previously have made in the
configuration file, so while it's a good quick shortcut to fix any
problems, it's no substitute for having a backup.<p>

<h3><A NAME="configuration">The most important configuration
commands:</A></h3><p>

There are a very wide variety of things you can control by changing
your configuration file.  The generally most important of these are
editing the 1/2 line description majordomo displays together with your
list's name, changing your subscription policy, changing your
moderation policy, and putting restrictions on the information
non-subscribers can retrieve about your list from majordomo.<p>

You control all of these things by having lines in your configuration
file which say "variable = setting."  What the setting is varies with
the command; your description can be any fifty characters or so, but
many things take only "yes" and "no" as their settings.<p>

<h5>The description of your list</h5><p>

To set your description, include:<p>

<tt>description = Any 50 or so characters you want majordomo to
say.</tt><p>

in a configuration file you send to majordomo.  There is no default
description.<p>

<h5>Subscription</h5><p>

        There are three choices for subscription settings: letting
anyone subscribe any email address, letting anyone subscribe their own
address but requiring password approval for other addresses, and
requiring password approval of all addresses.  In respective order,
each of these settings may be put in your majordomo file by:<p>

<tt>subscribe_policy = auto<br>

subscribe_policy = open<br>

subscribe_policy = closed</tt><p>

The default subscription policy is open.<p>

<h5>Moderation (submission) policy</h5><p>

        There are two choices for a moderation policy: moderated and
unmoderated.  If a list is moderated, all postings to it must be
approved by password; if not, anyone can post to the list.  The
settings in the configuration file are:<p>

<tt>moderate = yes<br>

moderate = no</tt><p>

The default majordomo setting is unmoderated.<p>

<h5>Who can get information about the list</h5><p>

There are several commands which control whether or not people
unsubscribed to the list can retrieve types of information about it.
You can control whether someone unsubscribed to the list can retrieve
the "info" information about it, can see it included in a catalogue of
lists an e-mail address is subscribed to, and/or can retrieve the
roster of e-mail addresses subscribed to the list. These settings can
be set with:<p>

<tt>private_info = no<br>

private_info = yes<br>

private_which = no<br>

private_which = yes<br>

private_who = no<br>

private_who = yes</tt><p>

The default setting for all of these command is no, i.e. your list is
public.<p>

<h5>Customizing how messages look</h5><p>

There are three commands which can automatically add text to messages
which go out over the list.  Message_footer adds text to the end of
the letter. Message_fronter adds at the beginning of the normal text
of the letter. Message_headers adds new headers to the headers section
of the letters (the part with "From" lines, "To" lines, and so on).
All of these work in the same way:<p>

<tt>message_footer &lt;&lt; END<br>

The lines you want at the end of the text.<br>

END<br>

message_fronter &lt;&lt; END<br>

The lines you want at the beginning of the text.<br>

END<br>

message_headers &lt;&lt; END<br>

X-Header-Name: text of header; must be formatted HeaderName:
headertext<br>

X-Header-Name2: you can add multiple headers.<br>

END</tt><p>

In all three cases, make sure the text you want added is in between
the two ENDs.  All of these default to blank lines.<p>

It is also possible to add a word to the beginning of a subject line.
Since you only add a word (it can include numers or punctuation as
well as letters, simply no spaces or tabs or end-of-lines; like the
password, it cannot include a pound sign), it is done more simply:<p>

<tt>subject_prefix = one-word</tt><p>

This permits people to quickly see which of their mail is from the
list by reading the subject headers.  It defaults to nothing.<p>

You can influence where people send their replies to by inserting a
"reply-to" line in the messages distributed through majordomo.  It
works the same way subject_prefix does, with one word added to the end
of the line:<p>

<tt>reply_to = one-word</tt><p>

If the word you use is <b><tt>$SENDER</tt></b>, the reply_to line in
any message distributed by majordomo will have the email address from
which the message was sent to majordomo for mailing list distribution.
The default is nothing; the reply_to line will be omitted.  Most
mailers will then reply to the "From" line, which will have the email
address from which the message was sent to majordomo for distribution.
If you want a discussion list, you might want to set the reply_to to
the lists's submission address (e.g.
<b><tt>listname</tt></b><b>@listhost.uchicago.edu</b>), so that a
"reply" is received by everyone on the list.  <i>If you set a
reply-to, make certain the address is typed correctly and is a valid
email address, or all replies will fail.</i><p>

You can also delete some of the "Received" headers from the mail
distributed by majordomo.  These "Received" headers track which
machines received the mail, so that the path it took can be plotted.
If you want to, you can delete the "Received" headers up to the time
majordomo received it.  This will shorten the headers received by the
list readers.  This works the same way the private_variables do:<p>

<tt>purge_received = yes<br>

purge_received = no</tt><p>

The default is no.<p>

<h5>Other variables</h5><p>

There are many other variables you can set through the configuration
file, and a <A HREF="#variables">referrence list for them</A> is on
the next page.  Most listowners will never want to set any variables
besides those above; many will never want to set anything besides the
list description.<p>

The total configuration file is very powerful, which means you can do
a lot with it, but also means a typing error or a misunderstood
variable can cause a lot of problems.  Therefore, if you do change any
other variables, you should be careful to save a copy of your
configuration file first and to watch the list carefully for a couple
of days afterwards.<p>

<h2>Your Responsibilities</h2><p>

There is a certain amount of routine work associated with every
mailing list.  Majordomo is designed to minimize this work, but there
is a certain amount of work that must be done by a human being; even
if everything goes smoothly, somebody must make certain that majordomo
is doing its job.  ACS doesn't have the personnel to manage every
mailing list.  Therefore, before we create a mailing list, we require
a list owner who agrees to handle this routine work.<p>

By agreeing to become a mailing list owner, you're taking on
responsibility to see that your list runs smoothly.  ACS will run
majordomo and the listhost machine to give you tools for this, and we
will help you out in an emergency.  However, you must handle the
routine work yourself.<p>

If you have your list set to permit users to subscribe and unsubscribe
themselves (subscription_policy=open) and to let messages sent to the
list address be distributed to the subscribers without requiring
validation (moderated=no), your job should be fairly easy.  If you
moderate the mailing list, or require subscription approval, things
will be somewhat more difficult, but majordomo should keep the
administration load as low as possible.<p>

The administration work you will need to do can be split into two
parts: the things you will need to do to begin your list, and the
things you will need to manage your list once the list is started.<p>

When you start a list, you should read this document carefully, use
the newinfo command to set up a description of the list, and add the
half-line description of your list to the configuration file.  If
there are any other important changes you want to make to the
configuration file - making the list moderated, for example - you
should also make them at this time.<p>

While running your list, you should keep a copy of this document and
<A HREF="majordomo.basic.html">the majordomo subscriber document</A>
handy.  On a daily basis, you should also read your list
administration e-mail and take care of any urgent needs, for example:
urgent subscription requests, bounce messages, any unsubscription
requests (all unsubscription requests should be thought of as urgent
because people tend to become angry if they keep receiving mail from a
list much after they requested that the messages stop coming -- and
therefore unsubscription requests are an easy problem which can
balloon into a bigger problem very easily).  On a regular basis, you
should take care of any routine work: get a copy of the current
subscribers to the list, handle the subscription requests, any
requests for basic information about the list, and so on.<p>

These administration tasks should not take up very much of your time
unless your list becomes very large.  However, they need to be done
regularly, or minor problems can become major ones.<p>
