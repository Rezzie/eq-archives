Thank god someone finally spoke up!! I have to admit I myself am a powergamer!
I agree completely, and utterly with Jeff Olmstead. I have been wishing to say
that for the past several months when people constantly insult us..But I did
not know how to phrase it..You know? Well, Jeff did not leave his email
address in the article that he wrote, otherwise I would have sent it to him as
well. I would appreciate it if you forwarded this to him. Thank you Jeff, for
being a power-gamer, and not allowing what other people think about you
influence the way you play the game! And thank you Everquest express, for
putting it on your page, and not label it as another power-gamer's
complaining!
