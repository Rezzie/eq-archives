Pale waxing light streaming through to illuminate the symbols,<br>
Reminding me I've spent another night awake in my chambers<br>
Secretly coveting the words of the Goddess Erollisi Marr<br>
While balancing my duty to my creator, my patron Tunare.
<br><br>
Silently striding past marble pillars, over marbled floors<br>
To replace the tome of Erollisi before the morning rites<br>
While the other initiates break the slumber of night,<br>
Back now, protected by Tunare's double-handed swords.
<br><br>
The searing pride wells during the training,<br>
Mock combats and meditative prayer, focusing,<br>
But still the memory evokes, following me along,<br>
Her spry, sylvan smile as she breathes life to her song.
<br><br>
Suppressing a smile as I concentrate<br>
Yet still I am haunted by that lovely face<br>
Those eyes that captured my duty-bound heart<br>
Spinning the melodies of Kelethin's art.
<br><br>
Days pass onwards, studious tutelage<br>
Absorbing the wisdom of Tynkale's words,<br>
Balancing lunges with heavy worn swords,<br>
Meditating for wisdom, serene rites of passage.
<br><br>
Running the missions, proving my worth,<br>
Tempering my mettle with love-stricken words,<br>
Dropping the gauntlet on our Orcish foes,<br>
Whose torturous fangs add to our woes.
<br><br>
Trying to honor Lord Jyleel's commands,<br>
While pushing back the vision of Orcish cruelty,<br>
The rended flesh of proud Elven fealty,<br>
Displayed horridly near Orc-claimed lands.
<br><br>
The path of Tunare's chosen winds onward,<br>
Swearing my oaths through prayer and action<br>
While sharing my growth, my satisfaction<br>
With the lovely bard, my sensuous ward.
