Like many of you, I went to see the X-Files movie.  In fact, I just got back.  One thing stuck with me…  Wait, two things.  The first thing I noticed was that the theme music played, just a few bars, right at the beginning.  Man, I almost got goose bumps!  Not that I have any idea whether or not geese can even get bumps.  Or that I've ever seen any person with bumps shaped like geese on them, ever.  And what kind of freak came up with that phrase!  Worse yet, what kind of insane society adopts it into it's common culture!
<br><br>
Um…  Oh, yeah, the theme song.  I realized right away that I was really looking forward to this movie.  I've been a fan since year two (late compared to most folks) and I really wanted to see what they had in store for us.  I wanted to know what was going to happen to two of my favorite characters and the world that they live in.
<br><br>
In the end, it was just an extra long version of the television show.  And it was great.  I loved every second of it.  But it did not give me goose bumps.  And I thought of EverQuest.  I hope I was only thinking about it because I had not yet written my editorial, and that I was reaching my deadline, not that I am obsessed.  I just hope that EverQuest will give all of us that feeling of satisfaction, even if it does not manage to make us shiver.
<br><br>
I also had intended to watch that movie and see if it would be a good movie for someone that had never seen a single episode of the X-Files.  I wanted to know if they had made a good movie, not just a good episode for us fans.  And I couldn't.  I was instantly trapped by the things I already knew, and the things I was dying to find out.  Remember the episode with the bees?  It makes a lot more sense to me now!  And again I thought of EverQuest (Curse me!  Will I never escape this thing!).  It occurred to me that people are now testing this game.  Most likely they are folks that have been waiting to enter Norrath for a long time.  And those folks will probably not be able to see the world with fresh eyes any better than I could watch that movie without drawing on what I already knew.
<br><br>
While it was not a problem for me in the theatre, it could be a problem when it comes to testing EverQuest.  Certainly testers are going to want to jump in and play their favorite character, to see all the stuff that they have always wanted to know about Norrath.  But there is a duty inherent in the fun of getting to explore the world we are all dying to see, that is the need to look at it with fresh eyes.  They need to make certain that they can step out of the haze that prior knowledge and expectations can create, and strive to make for us a great world.  They are the explorers and we need them to help forge for us a world that will meet OUR expectations.
<br><br>
We all want goose bumps.
