I just finished reading your article in article 71 "<a href="../Issue71/confess.htm">Confessions of a Role-Role-Role-Role-Player</a>" and I wanted to say thank you for stepping forward and declaring that you do value role playing above the mindless hack and slash I too often see in RPGs.  I first bought Everquest because of its potential of being a great roleplaying game (I've been a die hard fan of TSR since 1987) and was dismayed at the lack of roleplaying there was among the PCs.  It seems that many people are only interested in the mindless slaughter of monsters.  I stuck with the game and have since met a few others who share my views, and despite critics and players who maintain that the game is no more than a giant dungeon crawl, I feel more now than ever that EQ is a true RPG if people want it to be.  I hope your article inspires others to find the joys of role playing and am glad that there is at least one more person I know of who shares my views.  Keep up the excellent work.
<br><br>
<em>I'm glad you stuck with it!  EQ is an unparalleled opportunity to role play in a well thought out world with a lot of background.  I, too, have run across non-RP-ers and kill stealers, and I've just pressed on playing the way I want.  Thank you for your kind words about my article!

I agree with Negak da Troll. A few days following the Columbine tragedy, I made an OOC comment in West Karana that my deepest sympathies were going out to the victims and families involved in the massacre. In response to what I said, I had about three people ask me "What happened? I didn't hear about anything." Furthermore, when I tried to explain what had happened, I had players saying "SHUT UP, this is EQ not CNN! Just play!"
 <br><br>
I feel that there are some people who use Everquest (and other similar games) not as a fun gaming experience, as it is, but a complete escape from a world they do not want to face. This is ugly. It is fine to get involved in a artifical world, and to try and make it feel as lifelike as possible. But the moment that people begin prioritizing the fake world over the real one, serious trouble can start. I know people who are unphazed by the war in Yugoslavia. To them, the pictures they see on their television screen are as artifical as a riveting game of multiplayer Quake. We need to give all our heads a shake and realize that as soon as Everquest begins to be more important than the rest of our lives, we have problems. Not little, itty bitty problems, but big problems that will compound exponentially.

People are beginning to lose their touch with reality. People are beginning to forget what it means to be a living, breathing, human. People are beginning not to care.

Ok, Ok...I have finally gotten off my lazy behind and am sending an email.
 <br><br>
I love EQX.  Been reading it for some time now and I find it to be, well, "most excellent."
 <br><br>
I am not really a RolePlayer.  I guess I'd consider myself more of a PowerGamer, except for the fact that I am only level 9 and dirt poor....so I guess I can't really say I am a PowerGamer (or admit that I am one, but one of the Worst in all of Norrath!)
<br><br>
Let's just say I am a Player - one who perhaps roleplays his own personality through his character (if this is allowed in RolePlaying terms?).  I am a Barbarian Shaman in game and a somewhat tall, jack-of-all-trades Good Guy in Real Life.  My character Koobasa reacts in game mostly the way I think *I* would react if I were a 7-foot tall Extra of Bravehart.  I help those that I can, when I can.  I try to gain levels without extreme risk to my own life and limb.  I even drink a tankard or two of Dwarven Ale (mapping rather closely to Pints of Microbrew in the RealWorld).  
 <br><br>
In short, I suppose that I am a middle of the road type..the in-game RP-types may feel that I am not developing a character while the true PowerGamers may see me as a wannabe RPer.  In reality, in game as in Life, I am pretty much am who I am (no Popeye reference intended).
 <br><br>
Just a few thoughts to finally share with you.  Keep up EQX.  EQ needs something like this.

<em>[Ed. - Ya know what, while not the best kind of roleplaying, playing a character with your personality is roleplaying.  
As long as you are playing a Dwarf Warrior (or whatever) that lives in Norrath and understands, at least somewhat, the relationship 
that he has with his world and having your personality, then you ARE roleplaying.  Don't let us picky roleplayers or the pesky powergamers 
get you down.]</em>
