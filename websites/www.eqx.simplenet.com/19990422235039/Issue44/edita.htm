If you were given the chance to create a character for a game, any character at all, what would you create?  That was the opportunity we were given last weekend.  Characters could be from any world, as long as it was not one that we were already using for a campaign.  The characters would be plucked from that world and hired to work on another plane of existence, so they had to be willing to travel.  The setting would be fantasy, but the characters could come from any setting (as long as we realized that technology was not going to work on any of the worlds we would visit).  We would be traveling the planes, eventually.  And we had to create a complete character history, a complete world history, and answer a long list of philosophical questions from the character's point of view.  So what character would you have created?
<br><br>
Seven of us did it.  I thought it might be interesting to let you all know what my bunch of friends did given these guidelines.  I'll tell you about them based only on what I learned about them in the game.  I didn't take notes, so I suppose I'll make a few mistakes, but you'll never know it, and I'll pass it off as literary license.  And I can't remember a single character name.  I guess I'll list them clockwise from the GM, so that they won't think I'm playing favorites...
<br><br>
A suicidal pixie.  Sullen and aloof from the moment we met him.  With a bit of time we noted that he had scars on his wrists.  Most of us assume that this was some attempt to kill himself.  After he vehemently asserted that our psionic was to NEVER use his powers on him, he admitted that he had once had such powers himself, but they were taken from him.
<br><br>
Commander Data.  Yup, you got it.  THE Commander Data.  I have to say that this one did not make me stand up and cheer.  In fact, if you remember my previous rants on choosing what characters to play, you'll know that this one would be on the very top of my list of poor character choices...  The worst part is, the guy playing that character will probably read this editorial.  Hell, they'll make me print one and give it to him.  But I refuse to apologize.  Hell, he should apologize to his fellow players.
<br><br>
Human thief.  Okay, it's been a week now, and I don't remember all the details.  I remember this one as a pretty standard character, from a pretty standard fantasy world.  He insisted on calling himself a merchant.
<br><br>
Halfling druid.  Another one that I didn't learn, or don't remember too much about.  Seemed also to be a pretty standard character, from a standard world.
<br><br>
Human superhero.  Once the most powerful being on his Earth.  A hero for ending the third world-wide war on the planet.  Let himself become part of his own corporate machine, losing his status as hero.  Then stripped of his power and hunted by those his company hurt, as well as old enemies.  Glad to leave his world with the hope of regaining some of his powers by learning magic.  The group learned most of this through the use of one of the time mage's spells.
<br><br>
Agimori tribesman.  This fellow left early, so we know little about him.  He's a tall, skinny fellow, about seven feet tall.  He carries several spears and wears relatively primitive clothing.
<br><br>
Psionic mule.  A mix of many humaniod races, Human, Elf, Dwarf...  A seemingly useless jumble of genetic material.  He appears as a short, rolly-polly gender neutral creature.  He has shown the ability to speak mentally with at least two of us at once.  Despite the pixies unfriendly attitude, he still offers him his aid, if ever he wants it.
<br><br>
Human chronomancer.  Comes from a world similar to that of Tolkien.  He kept using the term 'tricks' to tell us what he could do.  When finally showing us, he was able to determine the history of our superhero, learning facts that none had known.
<br><br>
As I wrote those short descriptions, it occurred to me that the characters that I knew the most about, were played by the players whose characters I usually remember the best.  It seems that each time we play, the same players make characters that are memorable to me.  That may be because they are the ones that spend the most time creating backgrounds.  They are probably also the most vocal players, barraging me with character information, whether I want it or not.
<br><br>
Thinking back, I remember a few characters from the guy playing the pixie...  A monk named the Venerable Beed.  A perpetual follower, and not nearly as much like a monk as he should have been.  A ranger, named Pyre, that was once cursed with the form of a demon, and his vorpal hammer (icky, if you think about it).  Parlan Blackstone, a ranger that really should have been a jester, famous for his use of rubber boomerangs...
<br><br>
Whenever I think back on games that were a lot of fun to play, it is almost always the characters that were the fun part, not so much the game.  Sure, a good scenario is needed to bring out the characters, to give them a chance to shine.  But the best campaign will mean nothing without good characters.  So if <em><b>you</em></b> ever decide to play Worf, I would like to recommend a lobotomy.
