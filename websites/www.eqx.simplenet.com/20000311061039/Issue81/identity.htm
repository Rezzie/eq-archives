After the past few articles were not well received by the EQX reading public, I sort of swore myself off of articles.  <em>Just write stories</em>, I said to myself.  But then I've had some kind of problem with the game lately and it was something I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Now I sort of know.  There's a lot of pseudo-psychology in here, (the only kind I practice) so be prepared for amateur theories.  But then they all pertain to me, so I'm the only one I can really insult with this.
<br><br>
I've bee playing regular paper RPGs once a week for the past four or five months, while playing EQ nearly every night, if only for a few minutes.  And now I've managed to figure out what I really think is missing form EQ.  I'll break it out by category.
<br><br>
<em>INTIMACY</em>
<br><br>
When I make my characters for EQ I give them a small amount of thought.  Not as much as I do for a paper RPG, but enough to get me started.  The rest happens during gameplay.
<br><br>
When you play a character it is exactly the same as acting a character in a play.  The only difference is that it's all unscripted.  Naturally, to perform, one must have an audience.  If you play a paper RPG with a group of guys, they are going to know your character's aberrations and his virtues.  When he says something and you know his character then what he said has that much more meaning.  In EQ when you walk into a group of individuals and say something odd, even though it fits your character, you are met with silence and perhaps the occasional "huh?".
<br><br>
I made a character in our latest paper RPG (It's kind of like Project: Twilight on steroids and testosterone).  Since we were warned that this game would have a high body count, I figured I wouldn't get too attached, so I made a basic background for him; He's a former special forces sniper, used to sitting in the woods for hours and hours before taking the fatal shot on some unsuspecting sap.
<br><br>
Funniest thing happened though.  He rapidly developed more character as more situations were thrown at him.  Now he's lots of fun to play; skulking across the rooftops with his sniper rifle and his magic knife "Lucille" (Okay, it's not magic, but after he chased off a werewolf with it he thinks it must be.)
<br><br>
The chances to be weird in EQ are much fewer.
<br><br>
<em>LACK OF CHOICE</em>
<br><br>
I made a rogue character because I wanted to do sneaky things and perhaps play a character who has little trust in others.  So I began to play him.  But the character is fairly wooden; he's two-dimensional.  There is no depth when it comes to things he does.  He just does things much like I would do them, because often the game has no facility for simulating whatever it is you want to do.
<br><br>
When you approach an Ogre, you have a few choices.  /CON him and see what his intent is.  ATTACK and try to take his things.  RUN AWAY and live to fight another day.  HAIL him and see if he talks.  4 choices.  That's it.  In real life, there are many more.  Due to the constraints of programming and the nature of technology today, it will be this way for quite a while.
<br><br>
Now if I had made a thief in a paper RPG and ran across an Ogre, I might consider doing any number of other things, because there is a GM there to decide what the outcome would be.  Online games become stiff and restrictive once you've explored all the choices too many times.
<br><br>
<em>CLONING</em>
<br><br>
When I made the Rogue I decided on the guy with the eye patch.  I hadn't made a character using that particular skin and figured it would be different since I hadn't seen so many of those around.
<br><br>
There's some great law of online gaming that says once you've decided that something is "Unique" then suddenly EVERYBODY has it.
<br><br>
I've done plenty of quests in game, but never come across any quest "items".  I've never had a magic weapon.  In fact, my first magic item of any kind was gained last week.  I was sincerely beginning to feel inadequate as a player because I wasn't really pulling down all the big platinum and running around in a studly outfit like many of the people who were several levels lower.    <em>What am I doing wrong</em>, I thought.
<br><br>
Answer is, it's what I'm NOT doing wrong.  That is, if I have to camp to get a monster, I go off and find something else to do instead.  I have done very little "retrieving" since retail [the practice of having one guy get the monster and lure it back to the others] and I have no major plans to begin these things.  As a result, progress has been painfully slow.  Kill, die, kill, die… after a while having to kill the same things so many times really has a disenchanting effect on the player.
<br><br>
Since I have not gained levels and money the way people are doing in their "efficient" tried and true methodical manner, I am waaaay behind the curve.  As a result, I have nothing "special" about me.  No special armor (Barely any armor, in fact), no special weapons, etc.
<br><br>
I even tried to save up money to buy ring armor.  I see people running around and they all appear to be wearing Banded armor, so I figure I'll do something different.  Well, it turns out that both armors, when equipped, look the same.  So I figure maybe I'll hold out for chain.  Guess what… that looks just like Ring and Banded, I'm told.  *Sigh*.  I won't be looking unique any time soon, since plate is the next step.
<br><br>
<em>ROLE-PLAYING</em>
<br><br>
Once again we revisit this old gem of a subject.  Essentially, on my weekly games, I get a tremendous kick out of the other players because they stay in character.  That is, they all know what's bad for them but sometimes it's really necessary for them to do it anyway.
<br><br>
In EverQuest, if I did something stupid, I would be annihilated by the game and would simply have to spend my time backtracking to my corpse to get my things back.  There's no enjoyment from doing things beyond the normal tactic.
<br><br>
The repetition of the game has reduced it to the simples responses to stimulus:  See Jane.  See Jane draw knife.  Stab, Jane, Stab.
<br><br>
So the fallback from this is to role-play.  My lowest level character, Ezmend, was fun to role-play.  Problem is, because he was only fun to role-play with, his level is still very low.
<br><br>
I envy the folks who have a regular set of players they play with, who they know and admire and get a kick out of.  Right now, EQ is a solo game for me.  Mostly because lower or even leveled players get me killed, and higher level ones siphon off all of the experience and keep all the useful items.
<br><br>
A few weeks ago I was reduced to camping a dervish camp with a bunch of other folks.  Nobody role-played.  They all just stood around and waited for the next dervish to spawn, then they ripped him a new dervish ring.  One of the guys in the group kept informing us of his experience level.  He was two levels higher than me and managed to gain three "bubbles" in the time that it took me to get half a "bubble".  There was safety in numbers.  There was also boredom and non-progression.
<br><br>
After that, I went back to my rogue.  I used my considerable talents at sharpening weapons to become a salesman, running around Freeport and Qeynos selling tarnished weapons to newbies at very good prices.  Again, though I was in character, nobody else was.  My semi-clever sales pitches were met with silence, and in some cases, questions about where they could get sharpening stones.  I didn't expect a stampede of buyers, but I at least thought I'd get more of a kick out of playing a part.  Fact is, it's not fun to "act out" if you're being ignored.  It's equivalent to being in the best Broadway play that nobody bothered to go see.
<br><br>
I want the massively multi-player experience.  I'm glad Verant is doing so well as a result.  I'm sad that with the great masses of folks yearning to kill things comes the kind of anonymity that I can get in… [gasp] Real Life.
<br><br>
<em>That's it</em>, I shouted (Well, thought very loudly).  EQ has become like real life.  I'm doing a job, earning money to get better stuff, everybody else seems to be doing it better and faster, and everyone around me is a faceless blur of curt "hellos" and mumbled "goodnights". 
<br><br>
First time you kill a gnoll, it's a kick.  Now that I'm literally in triple digits on that task, the thrill is gone.  And once I'm big enough to defeat something else, it is going to be the same thing.  And in the end, everything that I wanted to achieve will have been done before me, literally thousands if not millions of times.
<br><br>
So I feel my time with this game and this magazine is coming to an end.  Not today.  Not this issue, but it seems to all be the same.  And the next big game will likely offer the same problem of repetitive boredom disorder (RBD).  The worlds will continue to be fantastic and well made, quite an achievement when you think about it, but if I have to spend a year online "working" to see the high end of high-fantasy, then I don't think it's going to be worth it.
<br><br>
A friend went and saw THE PHANTOM MENACE, first day, after waiting in line all night to get into the midnight first showing.  He said it wasn't so good.  I said, "With that kind of wait, nothing will be!" and I meant it.
<br><br>
Same thing here.  I'll push and push and get to level 50, and I can look back and say "Look at all that stuff I did".  More accurately, I'm worn out on the game, and games in general, because I can see myself actually saying "Look at all that stuff I did… over and over and over and over again."
<br><br>
But I'll still be around a while, hoping that something fuels the fires of curiosity that were doused by the hundreds of screen caps of spoilers and the endless sales of high-end magic items, and the general indifference to anyone trying to do something other than hack and slash.
