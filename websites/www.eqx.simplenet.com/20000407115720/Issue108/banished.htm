Banished!  Tossed out! Exiled! Removed from the Guild! Posy thought, "Get a hold of yourself! No use trying to discover all the synonyms, you've been asked to leave the Library Mechanomagica."  Posy opened her backpack and began to stuff her clothes and spare tidbits into it.  She had been by the inn for foodstuffs, and now she was doing a final sweep through her room.
<br><br>
Tobon had looked sad when she entered his office at his summons.  Posy remembered the wizened old gnome's face, stern at times, yet kindly when he looked at her.  "Posy, the instructors here can no longer put up with your antics.  Though you have always been a good student, you are a disruptive force here and should go elsewhere for your studies."  Posy had known something was in the works, but she was used to the punishments the various instructors meted out to her for her minor transgressions. Though for some they were punishments, Posy actually enjoyed carrying the dusty tomes and climbing the rickety library ladders that allowed access to the highest shelves.  Running errands for the masters let her feel and touch the wisdom and power of the ages, and her stealthy peeks into those books elicited visions of consummate spellcraft, Posy the Archmage wielding and refining mana into new and unexplored ways.
<br><br>
All the masters warned her against doing research until she had reached the Fifth Circle.  "Your understanding of magic is not complete, you haven't experienced enough to be able to delve into research until then."  Tobon must have said that one hundred times.  But, listening to advice had never been a real strong point of Posy's and now she was being asked to leave.
<br><br>
Perhaps in retrospect she should have not used Tobon's Lexicon to try to create new spells.  Perhaps she should have waited to get formal training in research before trying in the first place. "Wow, Posy," she thought, "understatement of the year."  She didn't damage anything, really, or hurt anyone.  Whatever the spell was that she created was causing quite a furor in the Library.  All the masters were in the conference chambers, and had been for several days, arguing.
<br><br>
She packed the last of her things, her spell-book, and then looked on the bed at the one item she couldn't bear to pack.  A little frayed, the once-bright yellow fading to a more washed out pale yellow, her guild tunic lay spread out against the bed cover.  She had studied weeks, practiced spells until her dreams caused her to wiggle her fingers under the mattress in her sleep to earn that piece of clothing. Her family had given up their meager savings so she could attempt to earn it.  No other school in the world used that yellow, only the Library Mechanomagica.  Lifting it to her nose, she could smell the faint traces of ozone from her beginning fumblings with magic which had scorched the material.  On an impulse, she donned it.  She would walk out wearing it, proclaiming to all that she was a Wizard of the Library, and though she could no longer stay <b>in</b> the Library, she was <b>of</b> it, and a skilled wizard.
<br><br>
She waved to the guards at the entrance to Ak'Anon as she walked out of the city.  They had always liked her, and as they knew nothing of the uproar she had caused, they waved back cheerily.
<br><br>
Posy had decided that she could continue her studies at Felwithe at their Academy of Arcane Science, which her friend Oghma had told her about.  Surely the elven mages were at least as good as their gnome counterparts, and she would be able to learn research there.  She had a map that Oghma had given her before he left for Kaladim.  He had noted down the paths to take and the dangers on the way, so she felt confident enough to make it through the Lesser Faydark forest.  After all, she did have some skills as a wizard to protect herself.
<br><br>
She trotted out past the first intersection and went right.  The kobolds she had feared so much before didn't range this close to town, and there were guards at each intersection on the way to the windmills.  She reached the second intersection and stopped a moment.  To go left was to head to the pass to the Lesser Faydark, and to go right was to go to the windmills.
<br><br>
Posy had changed quite a bit since that first day out of Ak'Anon.  She had gone through 2 more spell circles, and while this made her more powerful, it still was not anywhere near a great wizard.  Just being able to assess herself honestly was something she had learned along the way.  She and Oghma had often spoken during down-times, about being a wizard or being a cleric and what they hoped for the future.  Oghma was always pragmatic about things in a way the she wasn't.  Posy thought that another way she had changed was to be a little more focused, and less easily distracted.  She missed Oghma, and hoped she might see him on the way, or maybe in Felwithe.  Here she was now, about to embark on the greatest journey of her life so far, and no friends were here to take it with her.  
<br><br>
The watchman at the intersection asked, "Lost, miss?"  Posy shook herself, and replied, "More than you know."
<br><br>
The guards surprised face faded down the path as Posy set off towards the Lesser Faydark pass, mindful of the skeletons that roamed this stretch of road she slipped through the pass in the Lesser Faydark and ran along the back side of Steamfont Mountain Range.  Though hilly, it was only inhabited by faeries that were harmless if not bothered.
<br><br>
A faerie noble buzzed past her, the gossamer wings moving rapidly.  The faerie looked like a little blue elf, and carried a spear that was not even as big as Posy's dagger.  She looked at Posy warily, and flew off.  Posy smiled - though they looked tiny, the faeries were fierce defenders of the animals of the Faydark.
<br><br>
Posy found the path to the pass into the Greater Faydark forest, and angled in.  She decided to take a break and have lunch, since the pass was fairly busy with travelers, the wildlife didn't come here often.  She sat down and opened her pack to eat some of the rations she had packed for the trip.
<br><br>
"Hail!" came a shout from the path.
<br><br>
"Hello!" replied Posy.
