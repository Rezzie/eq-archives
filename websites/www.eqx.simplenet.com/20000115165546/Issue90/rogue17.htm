<b>Part Seventeen</b>


<br><br>

   The Temple of Marr was a huge and impressive building of white marble, situated in the most expensive district of Freeport.  The Paladins patrolled the streets here, at the request of the citizens.  The Militia rarely entered the area, and when they did, they came in large groups and did not stay long.  Armed conflict had been avoided so far, but the tension was palpable whenever Paladins and Militia came face to face.
<br><br>
   Not everyone was happy with the amount of power that the Paladins had in Freeport.  They were an independent army within the city walls, or near enough.  The city council tolerated them because they had no choice.  They were too strong to expel.  So a state of uneasy truce existed in Freeport, with the city divided almost evenly into sections of Militia or Paladin control.  Both groups officially deferred to the Council, but in practice, they did pretty much as they pleased.  
<br><br>
   Ample evidence of this was apparent as the Fier'dal Paladin took Gwyn through the lofty white halls of the Temple.  In one room they passed, a Lord Captain was holding court, hearing a case of fraud brought by one citizen against another.  This was a new development from when Gwyn had lived in Freeport.  He couldn't imagine what had caused the Council to let control of the Justice Courts go to the Paladins.  He said as much, and his guide, whose had named herself Sevael Neir, looked sideways at him.
<br><br>
   "There was no official transfer of power, it is true," she said, and refused to elaborate.  Gwyn was silent, his mind racing.   If the Council's power had broken down far enough for people to voluntarily start coming to the Paladins to administer Justice… Civil war was about to erupt.  Into this, Bayle had wandered, and hoped to get his trading accord signed!  How had the man not known the conditions in Freeport?  Gwyn had always been a front-line soldier and knew little of intelligence, but surely Qeynos had eyes-and-ears in all the major cities.    
<br><br>
   Sevael stopped at a pair of tall oak doors, polished to a mirror finish.  She knocked twice, then opened them, and motioned for him to precede her.  He went forward, into the room.
<br><br>
   It was not large, but richly appointed, with a high ceiling and tall arched windows.  A heavy desk sat against a wall, and at that desk, bent over several papers with a forbidding frown on his face…
<br><br>
   Gwyn stopped dead and just stared.  Antonius Bayle lifted his head from his work and at the sight of Gwyn, a smile spread across his handsome face.  He leapt up from the chair and came forward, beaming.
<br><br>
   "Wherever did you find him, Sevael!" he exclaimed, and gripped Gwyn's shoulders.  "My boy, I am so glad to see you alive.  I hoped that you had gotten away."
<br><br>
   "Sir," said Gwyn weakly.  "Sir…" It seemed the only thing he was capable of was repeating that word.
<br><br>
   "Sit down, sit down."  Bayle urged him to a chair, and he took it, sitting with a thump as his legs gave way.  "Sevael, could you ask the Lord General to join us?"  She bowed and left, closing the doors behind her.  Bayle focused on Gwyn again.  
<br><br>
   "I thought you were dead," managed Gwyn, trying to come to grips with this new development.
<br><br>
   "I suppose I owe you an explanation," agreed Bayle, moving around the desk to his chair again.  He leaned back and regarded Gwyn with his trademark piercing gaze.  "What do you remember of that night, Gwyn?"
<br><br>
   "We were questioning m…the prisoner," he answered.  He hoped that Bayle had not noticed the slight stumble.  "You told Somhan to leave.  You were saying something about this Daryth when she broke free.  She must have been very well trained to have gotten free from those shackles.  Freeport is not known for the laxness of her prisons.  In the confusion, Somhan entered.  The assassin made a slip, and we recaptured her.  Then…" Gwyn faltered.
<br><br>
   "Then he stabbed me," supplied Bayle.
<br><br>
   "But that couldn't have happened!" Gwyn leaned forward.  "Sir, I have seen men take wounds less serious than the one I saw in your back and die within minutes.  How did you survive?"
<br><br>
   Bayle smiled grimly.
<br><br>
   "I would like you to meet someone, Gwyn."  He turned and pulled a small bellrope.  There was a brief pause, and then the doors opened once more to admit a slight, nondescript man in the plate and uniform of a full Paladin.  Gwyn glanced at him, puzzled, and then brought his eyes back to the man's face in astonishment.
<br><br>
   "Reed?" he asked, incredulous.  The man had been one of the Guardsmen under Gwyn's command. He turned back to Bayle.  "Reed is a Paladin?"
<br><br>
   "His name is Dareed, actually, and yes, he is.  I regret deceiving you, Gwyn, but no one could know that I was bringing a Paladin from Qeynos to this…" he waved at the windows.  "…snakepit.  The situation here are more than delicate, Gwyn."
<br><br>
   "So Dareed kept you alive," said Gwyn slowly.  "While I ran for my life."
<br><br>
   "Gwyn, don't berate yourself.  You went after Somhan.  As far as you knew, I was dead.  You were following your duty as best you knew.  It was just as well that you did."  Bayle's expression turned grim.
<br><br>
   "Somhan came back, Gwyn.  With a wizard.  He didn't even bother to find out if any of his men were still alive in the cell, he just firebombed it."  The Paladin came forward as he spoke, and took a chair next to Gwyn.
<br><br>
   "How did you manage to survive that, m'lord?" Gwyn turned an incredulous gaze from the Paladin to Bayle.
<br><br>
   "Do you mean for me to tell you all my secrets?"  Bayle's smile was a hint mischievous.  "That was your doing," he continued, more serious.  "By taking after Somhan like that, I believe you delayed him long enough for us to exit the cell before he got back.  We had barely rounded a corner when we heard the explosion."
<br><br>
   "So then, Somhan can't know whether you are alive or dead."
<br><br>
   "He can't move either way until he does know for sure."  Dareed leaned forward.  "There were several bodies in the cell, both his men and yours.  He cannot know that Bayle was not among them.  He is waiting."
<br><br>
   "Waiting for me to show up out of the woodwork," said Bayle.  "All this was Dareed's idea.  I must admit, I did not enjoy being stabbed, especially in the back, but for the time being, it does seem to have achieved my goal in coming here."
<br><br>
   "And what was that goal, sir?" asked Gwyn, leaning forward.  "Surely you could not have expected to get the Council interested in your trade accord with the city about to burst into civil disruption around them!"
<br><br>
   "No, Gwyn," answered Bayle, shaking his head.  "Another necessary deception.   I came here to prevent a civil war."
