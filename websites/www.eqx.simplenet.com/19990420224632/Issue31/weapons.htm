     Weapons have different base damages, different speeds, different weights, different class restrictions, different race restrictions, some are one handed, some are two handed, some are slashing weapons (which is a skill), some are crushing weapons (which is another skill), some are piercing weapons (which is another skill), some cast spells, some are enchanted to increase/decrease stats, and they all look different, too :) 1 dominant weapon? Heh, in EverQuest there won't be one dominate anything. It all depends on who you are, what you're doing, and where you're doing it.

I got a woody when I read that reply from Brad.  Not because I'm attracted to Brad sexually, but because he really has a handle on RPG gaming!   &nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Although he is very attractive...</em>]
<br><br>
I would have to agree with Brad.  Weapons should have different base damages, speeds, weights, restrictions, and depending on whom is using the weapon, different damages inflicted with the same weapon but wielded by different classes.  For example a hill giant wielding a normal steel short sword should do considerably more damage then say a dwarf wielding the same weapon.  
<br><br>
[<em>Nothing against dwarf's Oghma *grin*</em>]
<br><br>
Also, not only should weapons have uniqueness in damage, I think they should be displayed uniquely.  When you see a character wielding a long sword, it should look like a long sword.  And just to take that one step further I would like to see a black longsword with ancient carvings LOOK like a black longsword with ancient carvings.  If you're carrying a flaming broadsword by GOD let me see fire burning off that weapon when it's being wielded! And 3dfx glide fire at that! 
<br><br>
I have always been very fond of equipment.  Even in the D&D days, I was often accused of being a packrat by other gamers.  Of course this habit continued on into the mud days.  I could often be found at the town fountain auctioning items for hours at a time.  
<br><br>
My favorite item has to be a quest item.  Something that a mob loads very rarely, which makes it worth a ton of money!  Something that others would kill for.  A quest item has a history, and it should only load one at a time.  I mean it won't be worth much if everyone that passed you in town was carrying a King Ming's Sword of Sharpness.  Where's the value in that?  
<br><br>
Since the addition of "<em>Die by the Sword</em>", and "<em>Death Trap Dungeon</em>", I have really grown fond of visualizing weapon damage represented in slashes stabs, and even amputations!   I mean its great to actually watch your sword lob someone's head off.   I sometimes find myself continuously whacking away at the corpse just to see his other limbs go flying.  It's also a rush to grab one of his amputated limbs, and use it to beat up the next opponent.  &nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>I know I'm out on a limb here.</em>]
<br><br>
Now the reality.  Some of these special effects like flaming swords, and infliction damage require CPU cycles to load, which can inherently lag, and worse, ruin the game.  
<br><br>
It is my burning desire, that during the beta period of EverQuest, the team is able to implement some of these special effects and decided how it effects the game.  If, in fact it does take away from gameplay then obviously it's not worth keeping. But if it enhances gameplay without taking away performance then by Golly use it.  It would greatly add to the effect of combat.   &nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>For all I know they might already have these special effects.  I would not know.  I'm not in the beta... yet</em>]. 
<br><br>
I also think it's important to have weapon/equipment depreciation.  If you use your favorite battle-axe over, and over, it should loose its effectiveness over time, or if you don't repair it, possibly destroyed.    I think it would be cool to be able to look at an item and guess how old/effective it was by appearance.  Little rust here and there, or the tip of the blade might be broken off. 
<br><br>
Well that's my spew on weapons.  I do want to thank 989 Studios for those wonderful screenshots this week.  I really got a feel for the interface, and I'd have to say I'm very pleased.   
<br><br>
Oh.  If there is a particular someone's butt I have to kiss to get in the beta, [<em>shout</em>] PLEASE TELL ME WHO IT IS….  [<em>I know I know…  I have no dignity...</em>].
<br><br>
Hey can you imagine some of us geeks trying to wear a full suite of plate, and wield a huge bastard sword in real life?  [<em>Heehehe</em>]..   [<em>Just a thought</em>].
