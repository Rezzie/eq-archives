I really don't want to write this.  I've been avoiding it all week, and it's now Friday, and I've edited everything I have to, including everyone else's essays, and dang it, I've got to produce.  So, without further ado, or whining on my part, here is "Wut I have to say".
<br><br>
Ok, here's some ado anyway.  The reason I don't want to write this is that I can't possibly encompass two years of my life around EQ in a single essay.  I can't thank all the people that need thanking, I can't praise my co-workers enough, and - I'm lazy.  To be done properly, this essay should be much longer than it is.
<br><br>
I've decided that it is too difficult to pick "one" favorite of each of our staff members, so I'm going to point out what I like best about their work.
<br><br>
Archanalia's touch with a simile and a good indicator of his occasionally sarcastic humor are his Mig Hammerer stories. I am always amazed at Arch's display of creativity across many fields, artistic and literary.<br>
<a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue102/migrhino.htm"> The Albino Rhino</a>.<br>
<a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue71/hammer.htm"> The Wounded Oak</a>.<br>
<a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue52/mig2.htm"> The Death of P. K. Costly</a>.<br>
<a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue41/mig.htm"> The Grassy Gnoll</a>.<br>
 I also love his wallpapers, and he did almost all the work for the <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue65/index.htm">Girls of Norrath Calendar</a>.
<br><br>
Razor often wrote things that had nothing to do with EQ but were entertaining anyway.  His look at computer newbiehood brought back fond and not-so fond memories of that first day I unwrapped the new PC.  <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue21/experience.htm">No Experience Required</a>.
<br><br>
Indicative of Ian Ash's deft talent with fiction, this short story is like many of his - good characterizations, dialog, and an interesting plot.  Ian has a wide range of depth and talent, and I wish I saw more from him every week.  <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue23/kip.htm">Kip Goodleaf</a>.
<br><br>
I'd seen Onnie's thoughtful, funny, and the occasionally insane posts on the forum.everquest newsgroup, and thought she would be a great addition to the staff.  I was surprised, though, at the quality and depth she showed in her first major contribution as a full-blown staff member: Nalixa's journal http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue100/nalixa.htm .  What really endeared her to me was the sentiment behind her earlier contribution <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue75/where.htm">Oh Where, Oh Where, has the role-playing gone?</a>
<br><br>
I miss Wynn, and his broad knowledge of beta-testing and general game-playing.  His <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue16/beta101.htm"> Beta-testing 101</a> was a timely reminder that we as testers needed to go beyond playing and hammer at the game like we wanted it to fail.
<br><br>
As far as my contributions - I still think that my first submission isn't that bad!  <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue7/rpout.htm">Roleplaying Outside the Lines</a>.  I hope that it feels that way for you, too, because this was a real act of creative courage for me.  I'd often wanted to write, and had of course written school papers, but my EQX writings made me very apprehensive, because I wasn't too sure that what was in my head would come out right on paper.  My all-time favorite, and the one I still get e-mail about, was originally published for the EQ Vault, and republished for Issue 75:  <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue75/romance.htm">The Romance of Role-Palying</a>.  As for my editorials, I can't churn them out like Absor, but I have a few favorites,  <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue100/edito.htm">Issue 100</a>,  <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue67/edito.htm">Issue 67</a>, <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue44/edito.htm">Issue 44</a>, <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue88/edito.htm">Issue 88</a>... Heck, just read all of em.
<br><br>
I have so much fun, and Absor mentioned it in his essay, just being part of our staff meetings.  If you want a good, roll-on-the-floor-laughing-til-your-eyes-blur-and-can't-see-the-screen time, come to one of our staff meetings. Absor picked a good example to show what idiots we can be with just text and a chat room, so please take a look at his essay.
<br><br>
And, I must really praise Absor. He has done all the html work for this since day one, and has done it <b><em>every week for two years</b></em>.  All hail Absor!  Not only is he the grunt behind the newspaper look of EQX, but he also write editorials that are always thoughtful and while we disagree at times, I always respect where he is coming from with them.
<br><br>
In conclusion, I just want to say that you really should look through our back issues. An incredible amount of effort and creativity is buried in these pages, and I just got the chance to look through some things that have been done and I am astounded at the quality of the work done.  We've fairly well chronicled the entire EQ experience, from pre-beta to the present, and I hope we stick together as the EQ community matures further.
