<em>Response to Starspyres article <a href="../Issue6/pking.htm">PKing and "Community"</a> in Issue 6:</em>
<br><br>
<big><big>L</big></big>oved the article, but have to send my own thoughts on PK'ing to you.
<br><br>
I have to agree that towns should not be the focus of the game.  There are enough "social"
mucks, muds, mushes and moos out there to satisfy the most ardent chat lover.  The adventure
IS the game.  Involving quests, large scale battles, anticipation as to what lies around the
next corner -- this is what will make or break EverQuest.
<br><br>
I must disagree with Starspyre that PK'ing is a symptom of a poor game.  Any game where we
have multiple players will attract a certain class of "players" who feel that the all the 
quests in the world(s) can not compare with the attraction of denying others a fun time.
Some of them will wish to have powerful character without the risk of adventuring, hence
they will PK in order to collect experience and items.  Some will not care as much about 
the items as they will want the noteriety.  Pk'ing will be with us no matter what.  We must 
be willing to accept it as a part, a natural hazard if you wish, of being a member of this 
type of game.
<br><br>
That being said, I certainly hope (and feel), that this world will be constructed and run in
such a way as to minimize the class of PK'ers.  Those that suffer from gaming boredom can be
controlled by an engrossing adventure.  Those who just derive enjoyment from causing others
misfortune will be there, no matter what the world has to offer.
