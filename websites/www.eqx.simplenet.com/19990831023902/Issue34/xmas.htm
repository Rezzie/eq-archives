  I remember when I began beta-testing UO. It seemed so wonderful, bountiful, - so alive. I remember quiet forests, the rare sight of gold, the stunning movement of a herd of deer. (yes, 4 moving together) While ghosted, I witnessed a wondrous event; a group of 3 panthers attacked and killed a deer. Everything about UO was glazed over in a halo of wonderment.  I to this day believe that UO could quickly regain its potential - but that it never will. I watch, even now, as it spirals downhill. I don't want to watch the same happen to EQ.
<br><br>
  Everquest is beautiful, it's undeniable. I've merely seen screen shots, the two pre-alpha game play movies, and read the beta-tester confessional. It is breath-taking to see out-of-game - and I'm sure even more so in-game. The AI sounds wondrous, the setting flawless, the principals pure and good.
<br><br>
  This is where things begin to go wrong. UO was rushed. Perhaps they needed money, perhaps they needed to publish or fold. Perhaps they simply weren't getting bug reports. Their fist mistake I feel, was too many - untested - beta testers. EQ seems to have learned from their genre-brother in this respect. this is good. EQ needs to be sure to iron out as many bugs as they can - before they too feel pressure to publish. (even quake2 was rushed to hit its Christmas deadline, it's something that even the best must deal with.)
<br><br>
  I recently read the confessions of the EQ beta-tester.  I too, felt at one point that money would be impossible to come by in UO, and that I would be wearing my studded leather armour (made myself) forever. But every system has loopholes. It is these testers that should desperately try to find the loopholes. check the price fluctuations between towns, check monster difficulty vs frequency vs rewards to see if there is any 'golden fleece' out there, etc. Player vs player combat is perhaps the best way to check weapon balances. I plead, be thorough with these.
<br><br>
  Early in UO's open beta there were jerks. These people were not testing the game, but rather the players tempers. They would herd tons of animals into blacksmith's doors, denying all entrance/exit (and slowing testing of blacksmithing balancing). They would block thoroughfares with mule characters before pushing was implemented. They would con their fellow players, and kill them for loot they would lose at the next character wipe.  In EQ's open beta - they should expect the same. Further, they should take pains to focus the group on the testing task at hand, and remove the unrulies. Testing server load is fine, but remove a handful that aren't constructive, and you'll find a much more focused and devoted testing group.
<br><br>
  Into UO's release, there were bug exploiters. I don't feel OSI prioritized bug fixing high enough, until show-stopping bugs were released to the public (i.e. the duping fiasco). Further, they were glaringly lenient on cheaters in general. EQ must learn from this as well. A bug is a bug - and must be fixed before a feature is added. A cheater is a cheater and will drive real players away.
<br><br>
  What I'm really getting at - is that without idiots around, any online experience is wonderful (MUD, IRC, MPOG, etc).  Even my first few days with Meridian 59 were extremely happy ones. Then the people kick in. Idiots, newbies, cheaters, exploiters, lamers -  whatever you wish to name them - they are there. In larger numbers in the release I guarantee.
<br><br>
  Please testers, please. Focus on the task. The graphics are wonderful - we all know. The place is huge - we can tell. The combination is dizzying - to be sure. but please... by the time I get a chance to play - <u>they</u> will already be there. <u>they</u> with their mules and their loopholes. <u>They</u> without conscience or desire to roleplay. <u>They</u> will be there - and <u>we</u> need a fighting chance. By ensuring the integrity of the game - by ensuring that the developers achieve their goals of game play, stability, and fun - <u>we</u>, I and all my anxious peers, will have that chance. I understand it will be a struggle with the graphics, the wonder, the excitement - but try.
<br><br>
  It felt a whole lot like Christmas when I got my beta CD for UO, and the enchantment was strong - Now, more than a year later - I pity anyone who play(ed/s) UO. Its integrity was shot with bugs and exploits, it's a husk of what it could have been. I thought I was getting a red-rider BB gun for Christmas - all I got were my eyes shot out.
<br><br>
  This Christmas came early for you EQ testers. Please fight that feeling of Christmas - see that the ideals of EQ are preserved; the wonder, the glory, the new-car smell. See that the wonder of EQ carries on for 12 months and more - the way it should.
<br><br>
  <u>We</u> can't wait to play EQ - the way it was meant to be.<br>
  <u>We</u> must wait for Kris Kringle (although Santa doesn't require an NDA).
<br><br>
thank you for your time.
<br><br>
- stability is no less mysterious than change -
