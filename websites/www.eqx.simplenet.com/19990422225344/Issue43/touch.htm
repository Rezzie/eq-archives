There were things to be said about being a research assistant for Morloth.  Unfortunately none of these things were good.
<br><br>
Truth was, if she had her way, Nulcea would be working for someone with more vision and less inertia.  Someone with a need to travel, not to stay behind a desk.  Someone who could keep his hands to himself.
<br><br>
"You have the most beautiful skin," he would say.  Being a blind man, Morloth naturally knew this from braille, as he would wait until Nulcea was near, until he could smell her perfume or hear her breath, then with the accuracy worthy of any seeing man, he would reach out and feel some forbidden part of her.
<br><br>
At first she thought, "For a gold a day he can get his cheap thrills, within reason."  But as the days went on and his hands became more invasive she became more willing to go to the massive library which was the pride of Erudin and do his research for him, as she would be well out of arm's reach there.
<br><br>
So Nulcea poured over books as small as her palm and tomes which were larger than her torso, all in the name of  magic.  Morloth was the kind of man who's mind was unknown to others; His thoughts hardly ever escaping his lips, unless they were the visceral thoughts of a man inquiring about the services of a platinum-a-night whore.  So while she would seek his information she seldom understood what it truly encompassed.  She had individual tiles, but never an idea of what the complete mosaic would look like.
<br><br>
The library at Erudin was in itself a strange pleasure.  There was a certain intoxication in knowing that she touched books that some of the great exploring minds of Norrath had also touched.  And indeed she would never be allowed to even approach some of the more revered books if it were not for Morloth's influence.  For all his shortcomings he was still a man of great influence, at least in Erudin.
<br><br>
So she would spend many an hour steeped in piles of books, much of her hidden from the rest of the room, either searching for the obscure notations and cryptic formulae which Morloth sought, or simply catching a nap.  It's ironic then that it was during this last activity that Nulcea came across the most important piece of information she would ever find.
<br><br>
She lay down the book <em>Imploritus Nectrus Ega</em> and began to rearrange the stacks so as to make herself invisible to the rest of the room, and lay her head down there on it's odd pale leather surface, and drifted off.  Sometime just before sundown she awoke.  She had gotten nearly an hour of rest and sat up carefully, pealing her face from the side of the book which had bonded to a small degree with her own flesh.  She yawned and rubbed her cheek where the book had made creases, and realized there were many more creases here than should have come from the tome itself.  She reached for her bag, which contained a number of small alchemical compounds, a dagger, some spare coins rattling around in the bottom, and a silvered mirror, and removed the latter.
<br><br>
At first it seemed like a smattering of wrinkles from where the surface of the book had most likely peeled up during her sleep, but in fact the cover was still in place.  She ran her hand over the cheek and began to realize that there was a pattern to it.  Indeed she recognized the outline of what she knew to be Antonica.  All scholars here knew it from their classes.  So then to it's left certainly this other outline was indeed Erudin.  And off to the right of Antonica was Faydwer.  So what then were the strange lines that seemed to run from Erud's crossing all the way around Antonica and to the northern reaches of Norrath?
<br><br>
Nulcea reached down to the book and felt its cover.  The indentations were subtle, but they were there.  Carefully she peeled the cover back and exposed the thick paper beneath.  There was no pattern on the paper, but when she looked at the underside of the cover there was indeed a map there, seemingly etched into the leather.  On this side the leather took on an even stranger quality, being far smoother and a bit darker.  She pealed the entire cover from the book, taking care to conceal her actions from the librarian, guards, and other patrons.  Then she ran her hands over its surface.  Smooth unlike any leather she'd ever felt, and almost alive in a sense, like...
<br><br>
She pulled the rest of the book aside and inspected the cover carefully.  If she looked closely enough she could see... yes... absurdly enough there was freckling!  And something which could have been a mole!
<br><br>
Despite the fact that she knew that necromancers were prone to write their notes inside books made with human flesh she had never actually seen one, and this made her feel chilled, as if suddenly her own skin had grown a bit thinner.
<br><br>
She looked the map over for any notations of what the landmarks where.  There were cryptograms there but none that she could decipher by herself.  Tomorrow she would research them, on Morloth's time.
<br><br>
By the time she was done with this riddle it was dark outside and many patrons had left the library for their homes.  She contemplated rolling up the cover and taking it out of the library, but decided instead that it was better to not have a book sitting around with no cover on it as it might draw suspicion.  So Nulcea stored the entire book on a shelf somewhere, sideways behind two other smaller volumes so that none could see it by simply observing the shelves.
<br><br>
She stepped past the guards and out into the courtyard.  Strange, but she could still feel the imprint in her skin, but realized it was her imagination, as she saw nothing.
<br><br>
Morloth sat atop a pile of animal skins.  His traditional seat was at the desk across the room, but he often sat here instead when he was feeling particularly bloated by a good meal.  Nulcea had of late gotten into the habit of testing his senses.  She had stopped wearing perfume and would stop across the room in the doorway and slowly creep into the room to see if he would notice her.  A cruel trick if indeed he did not notice her, but as he always did sense her presence she considered it more of a game.
<br><br>
This day he sat for a few moments, his hands pressing the raised print in the book on his lap, and for a moment she though that he did not notice her.  This thought was dispelled when he closed the book and said aloud, "Four chapters of Avarese's Prophecies is more than anyone should bare in a day, don't you think my dear?"
<br><br>
Nulcea walked across the room and stood in her customary place beside his desk.  A position of servitude, she knew, but then she was here just for the money and there was no denying that.  Morloth arose and walked to his chair, his aging bones making a few crackling sounds as he righted himself, then a few more as his heels dragged the floor and knees pistoned.
<br><br>
"What have you found, my lovely young one?"
<br><br>
Nulcea cleared her throat and said, "Not as much as I would have liked.  It seems the author you asked about, Irken, did indeed go under the name Olisiphus many years earlier.  Irken appears to be his real name."
<br><br>
He paused a moment, expecting more.
<br><br>
"Is that all you found with your day?"
<br><br>
"The relevant tomes were in use by others."
<br><br>
He shook his head from side to side.  He was at his desk at last.
<br><br>
"If you bring me such little information I may have to expect something other of you for the price I pay you."
<br><br>
Nulcea frowned and stood immediately.  There was no way she would do any of the vile acts that were undoubtedly circulating through the old man's aged skull.  In fact, she was onto a secret.  She didn't need him.  She had something that nobody else living knew about, even if she couldn't decipher it yet, with time she would crack the scribblings which annotated the map.  She didn't need his paltry gold.  Perhaps there were untold treasures to be had at the end of the lines and arrows.  She stood from her chair.
<br><br>
"Come now," the old man cackled, "I was only teasing."
<br><br>
He raised a hand, intended to lightly push her back into her chair, and misjudged her height a bit.  He lay the hand on the side of her face, then withdrew it.  Then the expression on his face changed.  Did she read a certain amount of puzzlement?  Indeed he had the same look on his face as he had when he poured over his elaborate books, the fine nerves of his fingertips delving into mysteries his eyes could no longer discern.
<br><br>
He put his hand back to her face.  He was... he was reading the side of her face.  Perhaps some traces of the creases still remained.  She tried to figure out how to explain them.  But before she could say anything she noticed his lips were moving.
<br><br>
"Antonica... Faydwer...," then his index finger moved over the same area again and again.  He was reading something there, and rereading it, as if in disbelief.
<br><br>
"Erudin," he said, then repeated with more than a little amazement, "Eerrudinnn".  His face looked ghastly in this candlelight, and it took on even more grizzled features when the man smiled.  His head looked like a skull decorated in a loose veil of flesh.  He said once more, "Erud's Treasure".
<br><br>
This was not possible.  All Erudites knew the legends.  They knew of how Erud originally hoarded all the magic and knowledge he could and then stored it somewhere as yet undiscovered.  Was it possible that she had traces of the map to the greatest wealth of treasure ever gathered, and it was in fading lines on the cheek of her face?
<br><br>
"Birthmark my dear?" He asked, knowing this was not the case.
<br><br>
Nulcea took a deep breath.  Morloth waited.  He waited for the breath to go all the way in.  And before she could expel it on her own, he let it out for her.  She didn't even see where he got the dagger from, but it was there, deep in her chest, making it impossible to breathe.  And Nulcea fell to the ground.
<br><br>
The old man took the sharp edge of the blade and set to the grisly task before him; A task that didn't bother him so much as he could not see the flesh flaying away from her face with the stroke of the knife.
<br><br>
"Thank you," he said to the body on the floor, "but your services will no longer be needed."
<br><br>
Morloth took the bit of his servant and carried it to where he could sit and transcribe it, carving a duplicate into the surface of his wooden desk.  This was the map he would present to the adventurers he would gather.  This is the prize which would make him rich and give him an army of followers and admirers.  And the scrap of flesh that lay curled up under his ink?  Oh, that is just a remembrance of a woman he once knew.  A servant who slept on the job, who wouldn't bend to his wishes, but who in the end gave him the most prized piece of information gathered by any modern scholar.
<br><br>
And when he hired the group of stout warriors and commissioned the ship and they would be at sea with idle time to kill, perhaps one of them would ask him why he named his ship the Nulcea.
