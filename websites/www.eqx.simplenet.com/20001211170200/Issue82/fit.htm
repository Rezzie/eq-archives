Not one to be outdone by a cub reporter, I've gone into the field to locate interesting things for you, our loyal readers...
<br><br>
Well, actually, I just opened the package that arrived here a few days ago.  But my contribution to this article is in the organization of the work, and this wonderful introduction.  And I do, despite rumors to the contrary, on occasion get up off my lazy a...

As a responsible member of the society of Norrath, again despite rumors to the contrary, I must advise you all to stay away from these freaks.

Thanks to Reiss Kendan of Karana for sending me this news, and these pictures.  Unfortunately we can't reimburse you for the cost of the artist.  After all, the guy isn't even all that good.
