<em>To enter dungeons, you locate the entrance and walk into a swirling
portal, after which you are plopped down into the dungeon. Swirling portals
are a cheesy way to get around developing the transitions and realistic
entrances into other areas. It also detracts from the submersive feel,
because every time you warp through a portal you are reminded of how absurd
it really is.</em>

The portals at E3 were there for demoing. It's not really practical to travel
for 10 minutes during a demo just to show someone something - you need a
quick way around because an average show floor demo only lasts a few minutes.
While we will be using a form of portals in the final game, they certainly
won't be any where near the towns (who would build a town next to an invation
point?)

<em>One more thing. Have you heard about Asheron Call's background story?
Funny, neither have I.</em>

Thats simply because we don't want to release the entire story months before
the game is going online. Over the next few weeks, Toby (Lead Game Designer
for AC) will be adding quite a bit of content to our website, mostly
backstory. I think people will find the backstory in AC quite immense and
detailed, once we reveal it. However, we're simply not ready to reveal
everything to the public at this time. Another thing to keep of note is that
we are not trying to create 'yet another tolkien' world. While many will
consider this a disadvantage, we really wanted to create a new world, instead
of just re-hashing all the old monsters and myths from the Monster Manual. We
appologize for doing something original, I know it's a Sin in this industry.
