<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 27!</font></p>
<p align="justify">
I have been sitting here on and off for the last twenty minutes, staring at my monitor.  A crappy form of writers block, the kind that hits you at the deadline.  Usually by the time I sit down to put an issue of EQX together I have a pretty good idea of what I want to ramble about.  This time the exhaustion and disappointment gained over the course of a long week at work and some fruitless overtime have beaten all the ideas out of me.
<br><br>
So I watch cable and stare at the monitor.  Then it hits me…
<br><br>
If The Dennis Miller Show was the only place I got my news, would that be a problem?  Maybe.  I might not know all that there was to know about what was going on in the world.  But I would at least have news with humor.  I would know how to laugh at the world.  I would be happy in my ignorance.  And I would be entertained.
<br><br>
And that's what I want for EverQuest Express.  I want this publication to provide you entertainment.  I want it to tell the truth.  Not all of it.  We are never going to be the best source for all the up to date news about EverQuest.  Other folks out there are doing that, and doing it well.
<br><br>
I only point this out because I have been reading many letters this week that make me think that our readers do not understand the intent of EQX.  Whenever possible, we WILL bring you the newest information.  But we are also here to give you something good to read.  The tales that are told by our staff and readers are my favorite parts of the publication.  Eventually everyone will know everything about EverQuest, Asheron's Call, Baldur's Gate…  whatever.  But how long might it be before you read a story that makes you feel like you know what it's like to actually be in Norrath?  How often do you visit a news site and laugh?  I know that while reading the articles sent to me for EQX I can be heard by the cockroaches (the ones I haven't managed to hunt down and stomp) to chuckle, each and every week.
<br><br>
I'm very tired this week, so I will not ramble on.  I just wanted to get that off my chest.
<br><br>
And on a technical note, I am currently updating the Credits page of EQX.  It's going to take me a lot longer than I thought to set it all up.  Basically it requires that I index the entire site.  So give me some time.  But I've started it, and I've posted it.  And as I am still working on it, now is the time to send me suggestions about it.
