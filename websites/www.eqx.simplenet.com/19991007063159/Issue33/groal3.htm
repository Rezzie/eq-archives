	Back at his ramshackle lean-to in the merchant's quarter, Groal washed his hands of Ogra's blood and quickly sketched out the floor plan of the areas of the castle he had so far that night managed to explore. He rolled the tiny map up tightly and tied it to the leg of a small bird trained to return to Jarel's  aviary. He released the bird into the ominous night and gathering up a few sacks of herbs, returned in the gathering gloom of the setting moon to the castle and Barbergan's bed.
 <br><br>
The night sentry stationed near the kitchens followed him down the same worn and stained carpet and up the chipped stairway into the Elder's bedchamber. The interior of the castle was not so impressive this second time he saw it. The guard left him at the door to Barbergan's room and Groal knocked on the raw wooden door timidly. The door flew open and a large officer stood there, sword drawn. Groal quickly backed off, holding his package at arms length saying, "Sir, I have been summoned."
<br><br>
	"Let him in, Gork". Thrack's thin whisper of a voice carried with it a tone of command the officer obeyed without the slightest thought. Groal walked into the room, noting as he entered the guard's armaments. Setting his supplies on a small night table, he placed a small quantity from each bag into a mortar. After a few minutes grinding the mixture with the stone pestle he turned to one of the Elders there assembled and said, " I need water."
<br><br>
	"Morack, get some water." Thrack walked up in an old man's shuffle to the young ogre to inspect his work and a middle aged Elder left the room. "What are you preparing, young ogluk?"
<br><br>
	"I do not know the nature of the poison so I have made what I hope is an all purpose antidote." Groal spoke without looking directly at the Chief Elder. "Regardless of  that Captain's belief, it is poison that has caused this great Elder's distress."
<br><br>
	"Hmmph. Yes, well. It is in your hands now, ogluk. We shall soon see if your reputation is deserved. If not, then your reputation is ended. As is your life. You are aware of this, correct?" Without waiting for a response, Thrack turned to the council members. "And where is the Captain of the guards? He should have returned by now. Gork, go find him. Now!" Thrack had been troubled at Groal's arrival and was now concerned that Ogra had not made an appearance. He had expected the old fool to show up with some excuse as to why the young healer lived. He probably had lost him in the dark. No matter now. The damage was done. He could only hope the country lad could not possibly counteract the exotic potion given Thrack by Kinlack. For the sake of appearances, he must now let the ogluk attempt to cure his rival of the effects of the poison Thrack had so carefully introduced into Barbergan's wine.
<br><br>
	Gork, the guard who had met Groal at the door, hastily left the room in search of the missing Commander.
<br><br>
	Morack returned with a skein of water. Groal took it and mixing in a few drops at a time made a thin green, evil smelling paste. He spooned this into the almost unconscious Barbergan. The old ogre choked and grimaced in distaste.
<br><br>
	"Still trying to poison me, Thrack?" Barbergan's whisper was audible only to Groal who had leaned over to place a dampened rag on the heated brow. This tidbit might prove useful as Groal now knew there was at least some dissension in the Council. 'Divide and conquer' was another useful saying of Jarel's. Barbergan began sweating profusely and seemed to slip into a deep coma. Groal turned to the Council.
<br><br>
	"He will sleep fitfully for a time as the poisons are drawn out. He will awake on the morrow. You must make him drink great quantities of water as he will drain himself of fluid as his sweat carries out the poisons." He gathered up his supplies and started for the door.
<br><br>
	"Where do you think you are going, ogluk?" Groal turned to see Thrack staring at him with his dead piggish black eyes. " If Barbergan should die in the night you will have seen your last moon. You will remain in the castle until he is out of danger or dies. Guard, take him below and put him in chains."
<br><br>
	Every instinct honed through years of training strained at Groal's attempts to control his overwhelming rage at this petty, traitorous tyrant. But he allowed himself to be led meekly away, the guard gripping his arm firmly and marching him down into the depths of the castle. Groal chanced a look at his captor and was surprised to see it was the sentry who had met him at the gates on his first day in Oggok. 
<br><br>
	"Hello, Bashra. I see you have healed nicely. You never returned for the follow up as I directed. If an infection had set in you might have lost that leg after my surgery."
<br><br>
	"Shut up, fool." Bashra craned his neck to look behind them then glanced back down at the smaller ogre. "You done a good job, ogluk. Since you fixed my leg I been returned to the castle and my old job in the Guard. But I couldn't pay you so I stayed away. Now look at you, about to rot in the dungeon."
<br><br>
 	"These cells are ancient", he told Groal as they marched down a damp dark corridor running below the castle. "The stones are old and rotted. Even the rats gnaw through them to freedom in the catacombs which surround the dungeon. If you are not careful, the bars will fall on you and kill you. Once I hand you to the Dungeon Master, my job is finished." He quieted as they approached an intersecting hall dimly lit by flickering candlelight. An old and pale ogre sat behind a tiny table, head bowed, a bottle of wine in hand. A rack of large iron keys was hung on the wall behind him.
<br><br>
	"Klaprok! Wake up!" The old man looked up with blurry red rimmed eyes. "Take this 'nadrol' and put him in cell 40. Understand?"
<br><br>
	"Uh… wha….?" Klaprok tried to focus his wine smeared vision. " Oh, it's you, Bashra. Another one? If Thrack keeps this up there will be no one on the streets of Ogguk. They will all be here with me. Bring him along then. He looks very dangerous." The old soldier's laugh decayed into a phlegmy cough as he stood shakily and grabbed a ring of keys from the rack. The odd trio walked into the dark of the dungeon, coming at last to a thick iron door with a small window through which food and water might be passed. Inserting one of the huge keys into the lock, Klaprok twisted and pushed. The door screaled open on rusted hinges and Groal found himself pushed roughly inside.
<br><br>
	'That's the last we'll see of that one", Klaprok observed as he locked the door.
<br><br>
	We'll see about that, thought Bashra. I think we shall see him again.
<br><br>
	Never had Groal experienced a blackness such as that which now enveloped him. He lost all sense of direction. It was as if he lay within the abyss of time and space, falling endlessly through a stygian night devoid of place, without existence. Not even the hell of which Jarel spoke so frequently could be as empty of reality as this dungeon cell. After an indeterminate time Groal began to crawl forward cautiously, remembering the words of his teacher. 'If you cannot see, listen. If you cannot listen, touch.' This teaching Groal now practiced in earnest, feeling along the slimy floor until his outstretched hand brushed against a damp surface. He used this as a point of reference and guessing at a hundred and eighty degree turn crawled forward again until he met the opposing wall. 'Thirteen feet', he counted out the steps he knew he paced on his knees. He recalled the hated exercises Jarel had put him through, blindfolded and crawling in the mud beneath a fence of thorns the Shadow Knight had constructed. Then he thought his master cruel. Now, he praised the wisdom.
<br><br>
	He continued his exploration of his prison, first on hand and knee then standing, arms outstretched, until he knew every inch of the cell. Bashra was right in that the walls were indeed rotted and the unseen bars set in one wall loose. One came out into his hand even as he felt about the moldy window frame. An almost undetectable breeze came from the opening carrying a foul odor. Groal guessed it must come from the catacombs Bashra had mentioned. He carefully and silently pulled a few more rods from the window and hoisted himself up and out of his erstwhile prison, falling a few feet into a cold repugnant smelling shallow river running along the wall. He followed it downstream for an hour or so and a faint light grew up ahead until it presented itself as the barred exit of the underground drain system. Dawn was fast approaching. Groal pulled at the gate but the bars were not as decrepit as the ones in his cell and he found himself trapped just as freedom beckoned.
<br><br>
	He returned the way he came, the light fading behind him even as it grew brighter. Soon he was again feeling his way in the pitch dark. His unerring sense of direction and distance told him when he was back at the cell and he continued on, hoping the tunnel would ultimately lead to a more cooperative exit. Within a few feet he came to a bend and this he followed for a long time, passing adjoining tunnels and hearing the soft murmur of filthy water and muck slogging it's slow way out of the city. 
<br><br>
A faint light drew him on and he came finally to another large grate, this time corroded and rusting away. He easily dislodged it and entered into a wide passageway lit by torches placed at great distances along the walls. He walked slowly and silently down, descending ever deeper into the stinking bowels of Ogguk. A distant murmuring brought him to a halt and he strained to listen, breathing silently. It sounded like a chant coming from a great distance like a waterfall heard from miles away. He cautiously continued forward, listening with great intent. The rhythmic sound grew as he came closer to it's source and the tunnel grew brighter as he approached another opening. The chanting was coming from somewhere just beyond this junction. He peered around the corner and saw a group of black robed Trolls marching in a solemn procession around a stone alter. A naked figure, bound and gagged was tied onto the slab of rock, struggling vainly at the knots. One of the dark marchers held a large, deeply curved dagger above his head, making slow downward motions at regular intervals. Around them stood a half dozen Trolls in grey garb. Groal was witnessing an ancient sacrificial ceremony, he guessed. And a female Ogre was the sacrifice.
