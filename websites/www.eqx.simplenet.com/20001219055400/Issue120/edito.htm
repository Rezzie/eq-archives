  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
    Karana rain came crashing down in a sudden rush. Trotting through the sheets 
    of water, Oghma wished that Brell, in addition to all the holy spells He had 
    bestowed upon him, had also given him a simple umbrella spell. By the time 
    he reached Qeynos, he’d be soaked.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Pounding up behind him was a man clad in green armor. The man paused as he 
    passed and cast a Spirit of Wolf on Oghma. “Come on Oghma, let’s race into 
    Qeynos!” </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
    trip made much quicker by spell-sped feet, Oghma found himself racing through 
    the Qeynos Gates and headed for the Lion’s Mane Inn with the green-clad man. 
    A couple of steaming mugs of hot honey mead later, they tucked into a meal 
    in a corner table.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    “I am Aradune Mithara, Outrider of Karana,” the man said.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    “Oghma, of Brell, at your service. I’ve heard of you wandering the Karana 
    plains. You are a ranger, no doubt.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    “Aye, and I have a problem that I’m trying to solve. I need to make sure that 
    my rangers and druids are notified of events that happen in the world when 
    they come back in to the Glades or the cities.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    “What events?”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Aradune looked uncomfortable. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Well, 
    events. Things that happen in the world.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    “The first part of getting the news out is that there must be news to get 
    out - People won’t read a book unless it has a compelling story, or it is 
    important to them to have read it. But, given that there are events, and events 
    that matter, here are some ideas. Let’s call it the “Oghma project”. First 
    I’ll talk about getting the news out, and tomorrow morning, we’ll talk about 
    making news a bit.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Aradune chuckled. “I had heard that you had grown up wanting to be a bard. 
    This should be good.” He motioned for more mead. Oghma took a deep breath.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    <b>The Oghma project, part I</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    “Assuming there is news to be told, there are quite a few ways I can imagine 
    to get out the news. What matters is who needs to know, and who is doing the 
    telling. I’m sure that the Circle of Unseen Hands has things that they don’t 
    want others to know, whereas the Guards of Qeynos may have things everyone 
    should know. I’m also making an assumption that you, Aradune, will have the 
    resources do to these things.” Oghma smiled.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Aradune chuckled. “Let’s just assume that I have complete power over Norrath, 
    and go from there.” </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma 
    grinned, then continued, “For broadcast news (things like the death of Lady 
    Vox, or the Invasion of Qeynos) there are a few ways. You could have newspapers 
    printed when large events happened, and distributed by newsboys. This paper 
    should decompose after a while, so that your cities don’t get littered. Town 
    criers could shout news also.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Aradune looked thoughtful. “Many areas are remote, though. It would take a 
    while for news to get out there.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    “I agree,” said Oghma, taking a sip from a bottle of mead. “But that is the 
    price you pay for staying out of the cities. If people spent more time in 
    cities they may feel a bigger part of events, because even if they choose 
    not to participate, they now that things are <b>happening</b>. And events 
    happen around us all the time without our participation, and it’s nice to 
    find out about it, even if we took no part in it. People don’t need to take 
    part in ANY world events necessarily, as long as the events move along and 
    Norrath changes because of it.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Oghma continued, “For legends and histories, there could be storytellers who, 
    for a few silvers, could tell short legends. This could add background to 
    the events of the day, and make people understand why Mayong Mistmoore opposes 
    the Ring of Scale, for example.” Oghma paused. “I think that too few people 
    understand why things are happening the way they are in Norrath. Most think 
    that the recent happenings with the Ring of Scale are unconnected to the recent 
    discovery of Kunark. The lure of adventure and loot clouds people to the true 
    history, and the rich history, that Norrath has.” </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma 
    frowned thoughtfully and took a sip from another bottle of mead. “A more subtle 
    way would be to have conversations between people. There are already some 
    things like this, but it would be nice to have it on a larger scale. If a 
    player with a high faction walks near a person with a like faction, that person 
    could divulge secrets with a whisper to one player, or start a conversation 
    with another person where information is exchanged. Quest-like prompts (or 
    not, even better) could allow people to jump in on conversations.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    “A cool way to get guild news out would be for each guild in each city to 
    have one runner type person. For example, entering Qeynos as a rogue, you 
    would see Fumblefeet, the rogue runner, come running up to you. ‘Hey Oghma, 
    didja hear about how there is a merchant caravan full of jewels that left 
    for Rivervale an hour ago?’ More details could follow, then when another player 
    enters the zone ‘Oh, hey, Aradune’s in town, I’ll go tell him!’ And away Fumblefeet 
    goes to share the news.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    “This is also a nice way to introduce random quests, not guild related, but 
    that just ‘happen’ to a random player. These quests aren’t given to anyone 
    who hails a person, but just that one lucky player with the right level and 
    faction to get it who enters the zone every so often.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Oghma motioned for more mead. “Of course, your entry into a city, with all 
    these things may result in a constant babble of sound, people talking, shouting, 
    players yelling… So you may want to make way to filter out news, in addition 
    to the other filters that are already used when someone doesn’t want to be 
    subjected to too much chatter.” </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma 
    yawned. “I think, even for me, that’s enough talk for tonight. When I left 
    Rivervale I had a heavy halfling lunch, and I’ve been on the road a long time 
    today.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Aradune nodded. “It’s time for me to rest, too. Perhaps in the morning we’ll 
    take up where we left off.”</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Oghma looked at Aradune, then at the bottles of mead. “You have complete power 
    in Norrath? Could you make the tab for all this go away? Talking so much is 
    thirsty work!” </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aradune 
    chuckled. “Done, friend dwarf. See you on the morrow.”</font></p>
