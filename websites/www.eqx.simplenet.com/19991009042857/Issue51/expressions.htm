<em>Jora Wrote,
<br><br>
I would like to see a section on terminology.  I mean there are a lot of words and abbreviations online.  What do they all mean?</em>
<br><br>
So you just received you copy of EverQuest and your running around the world of Norrath.  A small elf runs up to you and says, "Hey  are you a newbie?"  You see all types of scroll on your screen.  People shouting, commenting OOC, and selling things in auctions.   What does it all mean??
<br><br>
Well here is but a small list of terms and abbreviations that I could come up with.  There are many many more…
<br><br>
Channel Auction:  This is a channel to sell items you have found on your profitable quests.  The proper method to use auction is to first make an offer.
<br><br>
/auction I have a War Hammer for sale.  Min bid 10g<br>
(This means this person is selling a war hammer and will not take less than 10 gold)
<br><br>
The correct response he is looking for would be for someone to say;<br>
Thrash auctions "I bid 10 gold"
<br><br>
Now the auctioneer will say "10 gold heard Thrash"
<br><br>
If no one else bids the auctioneer will say "10 gold going once..   twice..  sold.. to Thrash for 10 Gold"
<br><br>
They will then find a meeting place to make the trade.
<br><br>
