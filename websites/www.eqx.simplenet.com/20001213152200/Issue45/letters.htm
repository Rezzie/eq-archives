To Absor and the crew,
<br><br>
I believe the most excited I got about a game, previous to my awaiting the
birth of Norrath, was when I first got the boxed set to 'Forgotten Realms'
(TSR). I would read and reread the many character histories and be transported
to somewhere far away. I would dream of becoming part (figuratively speaking)
of this other world where there were heroes that you would love to follow,
villians you would loathe, yet understand, fantastic adventures and treasures
waiting to be won. I would take my friends with me on these adventures and try
to share the wonder I felt for this new world.
<br><br>
 I can look back and feel I succeeded somewhat, but it ended as all things do.
last year, I remember feeling the beginnings of that feeling again. Imagine a
world with an actual virtual economy. A world supporting thousands of players
who would never meet in real life, and yet could still explore together a
brand new world. Think of the adventures waiting, I thought, The friends
waiting to be made. The legends just waiting to be written. The stories, dude,
the stories. written not just by me, but by people with the same love for this
new exciting world that I had...
<br><br>
I know Absor that you have never played UO, but I read your editorials and
maybe you understand how I feel. There are few legends being written in UO.
The few there are seem to be desperately striving to maintain a fiction of
fantasy in what has become something like a game of multi player pacman. I
look at this world of Norrath being born. I look at the websites springing up,
the guilds being formed. The names and character classes being chosen and
defended. I look at the hope by so many for a different place where someone
can go to MAKE the stories they love. Will this world be different? Will there
be heroes here? I can hope...
<br><br>

<em>[Ed.  That's pretty much the way I see it.  It's always been the stories that
a game makes for us, rather than just kicking the monsters in the butt, that keeps
me playing.  Not that I don't like kicking some monster butt too...]</em>
