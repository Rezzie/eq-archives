I must say that Razor has done it again!  I laughed my ass off at his
article "Razor's <a href="../Issue25/free.htm">'Free Entertainment 101.'</a>"  Never have I seen a more
accurate assessment of computer sales people.  Whatever you do, keep those
articles coming!
<br><br>
On another note, I would like to say again that EQX is one awesome
"magazine."  I look forward to reading it every Saturday and go into
"de-tox" whenever the issue is delayed.  Keep up that excellent job that you
all have been doing - it *is* appreciated.

I have really enjoying the three <a href="../Issue25/eqbard.htm">bard articles</a>
that Oghma. I was wondering,
since the bard articles where so informing, if you guys can do more article
on the different classes and races. That helps people come up with role
playing ideas. Like I am planning to become a human monk. But if I was
planning on becoming a bard I would differently would have a very good idea
how to role play him because of all the history and information Oghma  has
given on Bards and it would be nice to see some more of that. 
<br><br>
Also I really enjoyed EQ Express. I really like the articles that razor does. Also I like your editorials.
<br><br> 
Thank you for your time,
<br><br>

<em>[Ed: Great idea.  I am certain there are fans of the other class types that
have some information to share.  Send them in!]</em>
