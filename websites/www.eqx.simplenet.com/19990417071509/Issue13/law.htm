	<big><big>O</big></big>nce again I am going to talk about something that you guys have probably heard enough about.  But I am nothing if not annoying.
<br><br>
Recently a lawsuit was filed in San Diego Superior Court.  Several plaintiffs are suing Electronic Arts, Inc. and Origin Systems Inc. (along with 100 Does to be named later) for "…damages based on intentional misrepresentation; negligent misrepresentation; breach of express and implied waranties; breach of contract; negligence."  Don’t tell me that this has nothing to do with EverQuest.  It most certainly does.

Before you read my comments <a href="http://www.isomedia.com/home/uopleadings/lawsuit.htm">read</a> the actual legal document, if you are so inclined.

I am not a lawyer.  I have read a few legal documents in my life, but I am no expert.  I will still give you my opinions on the document.  I have no intention of telling you whether or not the suit is a good thing, or a bad thing.  I honestly just do not know.  What I want to do is look at the complaints and comment on those.  Essentially the suit is made up of 7 points.  I’ll paraphrase them and examine each.
<br><br>
Note that I have never played UO.  That means that I obviously know nothing about a lot of these issues.  That’s where you come in.  If you have played the game and can give me some solid factual information regarding these issues, please do.  I will be posting a follow up to this article when I have more information from those that have played UO.

1)  The defendants claimed that the game would be playable "24 hours a day, everyday".  The plaintiffs say that it cannot due to frequent server crashes.
<br><br>
I don’t know.  I have never played.  So tell me, are server crashes frequent enough that this claim is true?  Tell me in hours per week or percentage of the hours you played.  Please give me facts, not opinions.
<br><br>

2)  The defendants claimed that the game could be played in real time.  The plaintiffs say that it cannot due to "lag".
<br><br>
Well, I think this one is pretty easy.  While "lag" might be an issue for #1 above, it really has nothing to do with "real time".  The key here is the definition of "real time".  Not the words separately, but the term real time.  In the game industry it means that you are playing as you go.  It means the opposite of "turn based".  It has nothing to do with the response time of your computer or Origins servers.
