I awoke with a start, forgetting for a moment where I was. I rubbed my bleary eyes and stared blankly at the dank room that seemed to be crushing me. I gasped before I could stop myself at the huge giant of an ogre staring at me from across the room adorned in thick and heavy plates. He remained still and silent, but those impassive eyes bore into me nonetheless.
<br><br>
The humans behind the oak bar paid no heed to my stunned visage as I dimly remembered the long boat ride from the port at Khaladim. Yes, now I remembered. I had dozed in the bar just off the main pier in East Freeport. I had no love for these stone walls closing in about me, so I rose and brushed myself off and made my way to the door barely restraining enough so as to not start running.
<br><br>
Despite the dirt and general uncleanness of the city, the air was fresh and clean, with just a hint of salt in it that I was still unused to. I remembered the words of the human cleric yesterday who had enclosed a rather large sum of platinum in my small hands - "Go to Befallen" he had said, "You could do much good there." And so, knowing only that this dread place lies somewhere out the West Gate of Freeport I made my way out, thankful for the signs about the city to guide me on my way.
<br><br>
I wandered about the road in the East Commonlands until I reached the second inn - a popular spot for the myriad adventurers who pass through these parts. Uncertain as to where I should go at this point, I decided that a short hunt would be in order to clear my mind and prepare for the road ahead.
<br><br>
Being an Elf of the Woodland folk had its advantages - I was able to find enough food and water to sustain myself. I was unsure of the food the humans had to offer.
<br><br>
I broke from the relative safety of the inn and scouted the landscape briefly. The lay of the land was new to me, but I was able to understand its nuances. Over yon upon the hill I saw a great Scarab - a monstrously large beast. I was not fearful of it as I had seen such beasts in my homeland and had bested them before.
<br><br>
I raised my staff high and felt the welling up in power within as flames surrounded my fists. With my usual flourish I directed the blast of fire towards the Scarab and readied myself as it angrily ran towards me.
<br><br>
I was much dismayed to see that another of its kind was close by and had noticed my sudden attack. Doubly swift they both ran at me and just as quickly I turned and ran back to the inn with the giant beetles large as houses crashing through the forest behind.
<br><br>
"Discretion is the better part of valour," I kept telling myself angrily as I ran swiftly towards the inn - though I scarcely believed it.
<br><br>
I arrived with great relief at the door of the inn but was both shocked and dismayed to find no guards present, or adventurers to help a maiden in need.
<br><br>
I turned with a grim determination to face my foes - the hunter suddenly becomes the hunted…
<br><br>
It was with hope that I engaged one of them - but I knew I had little chance of besting two. Still, I am more stubborn than an old rock so I focused my thoughts quickly and seconds later my skin took on the likeness of a thick bark, and their vicious bites seemed to have a little less sting after that.
<br><br>
Somehow I knew this would not be enough, though they were as big as houses I am new with this staff and was having difficulty hitting harmful blows. I wished again for my lost warhammer but I knew wishing would not save me. I concentrated deeply, glad that my bark-like skin was enough to shield me from their blows as I drew upon my mana again. From the thick texture of my skin, terribly sharp thistles grew out. I was pleased as I heard each scarab shriek with every bite and chomp on my now less appetizing features.
<br><br>
With a new resolve I swung the great staff at them time and again, but my strength was waning. Each hard blast of wind and scorching bite of fire I could summon was scarcely enough to wound one by half, and the other was still full well.
<br><br>
I thought that I would again have to trust the swiftness of my feet when a heavily armoured cleric came upon me and filled my body with new strength and healed the terrible wounds I had sustained.
<br><br>
He asked if I were to slay both the creatures. Were the situation not so grim I would have laughed, but I verily begged him to take one of the foes. The mysterious cleric (though I knew it was not the same I spoke to yesterday) quickly dispatched the one, and gave me strength enough to slay the other.
<br><br>
I thanked him hastily as he was already running off to town. It was just then that I recognized (with some help I am ashamed to say) one of my dear friends - a rather tall barbarian who called himself Whitehawk who had arrived just as the battle ended. He was a warrior of great strength, though my experience in the world was close to matching his own.
<br><br>
I mentioned my need to reach Befallen and he claimed he knew the way hence. So I traveled with him through many hills and out of the East Commonlands into the West instead. Therein I lost him in the many twists and turns. I am certain he is well, but I was sad that I had to journey on without him.
<br><br>
I again surveyed the land and nearly fell over in terror at the sight I saw before my eyes! A great lumbering beast of a man was slowly making his way towards me. It took me a moment or two to judge the distance since his sheer mass was so out of proportion to anything I hath ever seen! It was as if a tower had taken on a human form and decided to walk the land! I would be lucky if I reached up to his knee, and I knew that with one hard punch I would be flattened well beyond recognition.
<br><br>
Though I was stricken with a terrible fear I knew that I had to find my way to Befallen no less. I hid behind one of the smaller hills and rose my staff high in the air, as bubbles and jolts of energy flew through and about me. A moment later I was hidden from the eyes of all mortal creatures - hidden in such a way that only the most adept rangers or druids could be.
<br><br>
Feeling slightly more secure in my safety and hidden from the great eyes of this lumbering monstrosity I made my way along the mountainside looking for clues to the whereabouts of "Befallen."
<br><br>
Through the crest of several hills I noticed a strangely unnatural gleam reflecting off the side of the mountains. I quickly made my way towards it and noticed it was a stone passageway carved into the mountain's side. Some deep intuition told me that this was it and I ventured within.
<br><br>
Standing close to the threshold off the innards of this dungeon was a Dark Elven Shadowknight. I looked at him with curiosity and also some anger. Long has there been a hatred between our two peoples, and I was loath to forget their influence on my past. I knew to be blinded by my own hatred and ignorance was foolishness and could indeed mean my own demise, friends are valuable in places such as this.
<br><br>
"Greetings," I said simply, careful to keep my voice smooth and inviting.
<br><br>
The Dark Elf did not respond, but merely turned around slowly, and then turned back as if he was waiting for something, or someone.
<br><br>
I was perplexed at his behaviour. "Hello to thee," I said this time, making my voice as neutral as I could, despite my rising annoyance.
<br><br>
No response. I wondered allowed if he could hear me and then I gasped quite suddenly while blushing fiercely. Fortunately for me he could not see my embarrassment as I had (foolishly) forgotten I was still invisible.
<br><br>
"I cannot see you," he said simply, essentially at the same moment I did. We both laughed merrily and the ice between us was broken.
<br><br>
I revealed myself to him, and though he did not show it, I suspect he was surprised to see a leather clad Woodland Elf wielding a staff the same height as she..
<br><br>
"My apologies," I said feeling foolish still, "But I saw the giants outside, and lost my guide to this place, so I hid myself until I could find my way here."
<br><br>
He seemed to understand this. He told me that I would be wise to find people to share this adventure with, as I would have little chance of surviving on my own. Watching him carefully I was able to deduce that he was well beyond my experience - something in his stance or the way he held himself. If I joined with him, I would be more of a tag-a-long than anything useful.
<br><br>
With a sudden determination and a fierce cry he leapt forth into the dungeon, and was gone. I supposed that I should also venture forth, and though I may not admit it again later, I held my breath as I stepped deeper into the dungeon…
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I was greeted immediately by a rotting corpse and a large rat festering with diseases. I prepared to defend myself - to the last if necessary, but the grim figure merely pointed ahead making no move to strike. I followed his rotted pointing finger with my gaze and saw a large room, with a caved in passage beyond, and many doors in the other direction.
<br><br>
I walked into the central area with great caution, and saw a paladin fighting a skeleton - it was a brief battle, as the skeleton could not withstand his might.
<br><br>
I suddenly, and very powerfully, felt a great longing to be home, as I again felt the weight of the stone of all the mountain above me - the fallen pillars and breaks in the floor did little to soothe me.
<br><br>
My heart was immediately gladdened as I saw a stocky dwarf come racing up the stairs, his beard bristling, but also with a ready smile upon his face.
<br><br>
"Hullo dwarf!" I cried with glee, "I am gladdened to see someone from my homeland!"
<br><br>
The dwarf then turned to me and proceeded to redden my ears and broaden my smile with words full of such charm and grace that he could bring any of the High Elven folk to task!
<br><br>
Though he was mocked with spite from many of the onlookers, he was undaunted and even begged forgiveness for their behaviour. He then pledged his life for me - a gift, which I could not take, but still, appreciated the sentiment.
<br><br>
It was at that precise moment that a hulking (and stinking) beast burst from passageway leading outside with surprising speed and agility that it left me quite agape. It was an ogre, though it lacked the plate mail that the other in the bar had. There was also a terrible wound at his eye, one that either could not be cured, or that he did want cured. He sat himself down in the middle of the floor - quite unceremoniously I might add.
<br><br>
"Gods!" was all that escaped my lips. He remained silent, and I judged that all the totems and herbs he held with him meant he was a shaman of sorts. I walked up to him as though an enchanted child would to some great toy, and slowly reached my hand out to touch him.
<br><br>
"Thou art hurt," I said quietly. This seemed to rouse him and he rose his great bulk up and to his feet. He walked towards me and bent himself over, his great head was mere inches from my face.
<br><br>
"Please don't eat me," I whimpered in an uncharacteristic display of fear.
<br><br>
"Ardana cute," he boomed - his breath putrid and terrible. I breathed (as much as I dared) a sigh of relief as he rose up to his full height and rushed off deeper into the depths. Never had I been so thankful as to have good breeding as I did then - what if he had not found me 'cute'?
<br><br>
It was then that I decided it was time for me to join the hunt - though I would do it on my own. I felled a few skeletons rather quickly, though I am not yet skilled with the staff, these skeletons were too slow and foolish to avoid my crushing blows. The blasts of fire and wind I unleashed upon them also sped their demise.
<br><br>
I had just returned to the gathering of adventurers near the entrance when a whispered voice reached my ears; "Join us, we could use thy skills."
<br><br>
I opened my eyes and soon saw two dark elves and a great barbarian standing before me, I did not notice them approach in my meditative state.
<br><br>
I could tell by the adornments of one that he was a knight of the shadow - strange that he walked about so freely with many paladins near. I could sense death and decay about the other - and his magics were dark and terrible - the very antithesis of my own. 'Twas a necromancer and his powers were comparable to my own.
<br><br>
I was caught. I could go no further on my own - could I use these wicked tools for good ends? I was alone, far from home, and in the midst of great danger. I decided to accept their invitation, and trusted to the fates to watch over me.
<br><br>
With our combined power we were able to fell many dread creatures. Rogue necromancers came forth to stop us, and they fell also to blade and spell. The barbarian proved to be a great warrior indeed, and all my fellows watched over me and kept me safe and well. This was confusing for me - the dark elves seemed to be good at heart, though their ways were so very different. They embraced death, where my kind embraced life. Though I suppose both are equally a part of nature and The Cycle in the end.
<br><br>
We were deep in the second level of this fallen place. We had just bested a putrid corpse in battle, though the shadowknight had suffered festering wounds, which required my immediate attention. Though I was no cleric, I was the closest thing to it in this group. Druids are not masters at healing - but they can heal well enough.
<br><br>
I was about to study the necessary spells when I was struck by something terribly hard. I spun about and gazed upon a skeleton the likes of which I had never seen before. Its grip was icy cold and death to the touch. It's bones were harder than steel, and its speed was a marvel.
<br><br>
I struck it hard with my staff - a square blow. Nary a bone was chipped, and it was then that my necromantic friend cried "Run!"
<br><br>
I was surprised at first as we were all relatively rested and prepared for the next battle (save for the diseased shadowknight). They cried out that only magic and magical weapons would harm this creature, and we did not have enough magical power to fell him by those means alone.
<br><br>
So run we did. We fled from one room to the next flinging doors behind us closed, hoping the beast would be too dumb to open them. But the creature did fling the doors open and pursued us with a vengeance. Back we went, and up. Back to the entrance, in hopes of finding more help for this was not a creature we could slay alone.
<br><br>
As we finally made our way to the top of the broken stairs we became sorely dismayed. Many skeletons and rats ripe with disease waited for us, in addition to those that gave chase along the way. Yes, this skeleton was great, and all the lesser beings joined it, hungry for flesh.
<br><br>
We ran hard and fast for the door. The knight reached it first and burst through, and I was close behind. Just as I reached the frame, my heart leapt to my throat as bone hard claws and groping fingers dragged me back. I was trapped! I could not pass through the door, the throng was so great. I struggled, leapt and tried to crawl away, but their grip was firm, and I was wounded.
<br><br>
Desperate, I turned back hoping I could outrun them and make my way back to the door. It was then they spied the necromancer, and the entire lot of them chased him down. Undead seem to hate necromancers, as it is firmly believed it is they who disturb their rest.
<br><br>
I grabbed my chance and raced for the door, gladdened and yet dismayed all at once that I made it through. I turned back and watched my friends try to escape. It was horror as the now legion of undead rent the flesh from the necromancer's body. His life was fading, and so I stretched forth my hands and focused my thoughts as healing energies left me to revitalize his now broken form. I prayed it would give him those few extra moments to perhaps escape.
<br><br>
Curse my terror! It caused me to tarry too long, and my spell did not reach him before he fell. He died upon that spot, and I could do naught but watch. Just then the legion turned, ready to give chase when the great barbarian came up the broken stairs and made for the door. They spied him, and hated him - so full of life was he. They ran after him as well, and I staggered back, praying he would make the door in time.
<br><br>
The gods saw fit to ignore my pleas and as he reached the door the throng held him firm and he could not get away. He was but two or three feet from me, his eyes full of anguish as they tore at his back. I stood there helpless, and trying to heal him, knowing it was futile. They would not let him go and he stood there about to perish before my eyes.
<br><br>
He looked at me with those great sad eyes and spoke softly and with resignation, proclaiming that he was soon to die. I looked at him desperately, and helplessly.
<br><br>
As he grew ever nearer to death a strange calmness overcame me. I looked upon the skeletons and rats and suddenly it came quite clear to me what I must do. I knew that I had to rattle their wicked bones enough for him to perhaps get away. So, with my last tiny bit of strength, just enough for one blast of my most powerful spell, I drew out the rest of my mana. 
<br><br>
A great circle of fire undulated about me, and danced in rings as I drew out the energy. Just then, when all seemed lost, I shot forth the greatest bolt of lightning I had ever mustered. It blasted bright and true right into the middle of those damned beasts and shook them all enough to release their grip, but just for a moment.
<br><br>
"Go!" I screamed. And the barbarian leapt forward with the last bit of his strength. He was free and we ran together towards the entrance.
<br><br>
I started to breathe again, and was able to focus enough to study the proper spells to cure my diseased friend. It was done, and he was well. I was unable to save the necromancer, but I rescued the barbarian. Not the ideal trade, but it was something.
<br><br>
Bidding my friends a reluctant farewell, I made my way to the door. I was saddened again to see the paladin, who fought so bravely before, now laying dead so close to the way out of this hateful place. Saddened, but I knew all was not lost. He perished doing what he loved - protecting Norrath from the wicked curses and creatures its bowels spew forth.
<br><br>
Sucking in a deep breath - though it was full of decay - I focused again on the drawing out my own, now renewed, inner power. A small rift formed about me and I faded from sight, and the dungeon that nearly claimed my life.
<br><br>
		<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
I appeared again at the pier in East Freeport. I looked at the tavern I had left just that morning - it seemed now like a lifetime ago. I walked boldly towards it, my head held a little higher and with less fear and trepidation that I had shown earlier. After the terrors I had faced today, there was little this simple building could do to intimidate me.
<br><br>
As I took my seat in the tavern, sitting a bit closer to that imposing ogre, I wondered softly to myself what tomorrow would bring…
