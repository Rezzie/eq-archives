<p>This column is my humble attempt to share with you the joys and grievances I have felt while playing Ultima Online. I could publish a book if I wrote them all, so I decided to start this column and recount the events that occur during each week of my life in Britannia. I will attempt to discuss a different aspect of the game each week. This week’s topic: The Speed Dilemma.</p>
<br>

	<big><big>I</big></big>t was a beautiful day in Britannia. I was strolling along the narrow, dirt path thinking about life and how precious it is. I had been killed earlier in the day, while battling an NPC mage, and only recently had I been healed and allowed to return to the realm of the living.
	<br><br>
	My inventory was light. I had some newbie reagents, a dagger, a white robe, and my spellbook. I had the dagger equipped in case I came across a rabbit, bird, or any other small game that I could kill and use for food. I had been traveling for about an hour, I seemed to be lost somewhere between Vesper, Yew, and Britain, so I just continued South along the dirt road.
	<br><br>
	I was completely naïve as to player killers and dangers that lurked on the road. I had heard rumors of people that kill for pleasure, just to annoy, but these rumors seemed more myth than truth. I would soon discover I was wrong, such people did exist in the world.
	<br><br>
	I was walking past a guard tower as I came to a bend in the road. Standing nonchalantly just off the path, was a character equipped with bone armor and a Halberd, just standing there. I clicked on him with the cursor, and I saw his name, Lightbringer, was red. I double-clicked on him and I discovered that he was the Evil Lord Lightbringer. I knew at this moment that I had met my first player killer.

Before I could finish that thought he switched into a defensive position and took a swing at me…CRACK! I glanced at my status bar in the upper left-hand corner of the screen, half-red and half-blue; I was fully energized before he attacked, now I was down to half power! I ran, ran like I never have before. He pursued. 
<br><br>
	I began thinking, why would anybody do this? How could they enjoy acting like such an idiot? Are they losers in real life that are constantly bullied by other people and thus they must take their aggressions out on people in a game? All these thoughts ran through my head as I continued running as fast as I could Southeast towards Vesper.
	<br><br>
	Every time I thought that there was a considerable spread between him and myself, he would suddenly appear and swing at me with his vicious Halberd. My Pentium II-300 would give me a sizeable lead over my opponent, but then lag would work against me and to his advantage, as he would catch me. 
	<br><br>
	I was down to about 3 hit points and feeling desperate, when the lag stopped. I gave praise to the Ultima Gods for squelching the fury of the lag beast. Away I flew with my Pentium II and quick Internet connection to safety and recovery. The Evil Lord Lightbringer soon stopped the chase.
	<br><br>
	I was relieved that I survived the attack, but also frustrated, angry, and disgruntled. I should have been killed. Although Lightbringer was not role-playing, he should have been able to catch me and kill me. I was annoyed that the only reason I survived his assault was because my connection and/or computer was better than his. My character was new, not very strong, not very fast, and lacking in endurance. I know not the statistics or traits of my opponent, but it seemed to me that he should be stronger, faster, and have more stamina.

I was able to run full speed for 8 minutes without slowing down and without stopping to catch my breath. How fair is this? I should have fatigued quickly thus allowing Lightbringer to catch me and end my life. I should not have been able to outrun him based on the speed of my computer and connection. 
<br><br>
	If this situation occurred in Everquest, this is what I would like to see happen. Lightbringer attacks me taking off half of my health. The powerful blow knocks the ability to run out of me. I am trapped, forced to fight. I raise my hands in self-defense and try to stop the blade from hitting my body, but I fail and I fall dead upon the ground. Does this sound harsh? Yes.
	<br><br>
	Let’s say he missed on his first attack, and I was able to make a run for freedom. I start running and he follows. I am a quick runner, but I lack endurance. I run away and widen the gap between him and myself, but I soon become winded, and my body forces me to stop and catch my breath. Lightbringer is slowed by the bulkiness of his armor, but despite this inhibition he has enough strength and stamina to run much longer that I can despite being slower. While I am stopped and resting Lightbringer comes up from behind and kills me with one swift blow that severs my head from my body. 
	<br><br>
	If I was wearing no armor, I had more stamina, and I was faster I would be allowed to escape Lightbringer, but my stats should determine my fate, not my computer.
	<br><br>
	That’s all I have for week one, be sure to check out next week’s issue of Everquest Express for more great stories from the Ultima Chronicles.
