<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings famed bard! I am new to the lands of Norrath and would like to know where I can find a guide to some strange expressions I have encountered at the homepages I have visited.   Words like 'train' and abbreviations like 'GM' are new and confusing.  Please help this new traveler learn the lingo so I may 'chat' with the best of them....May I suggest a Super Newbie Guide?  Such would be much appreciated.  (There is a lot which the Manual just doesn't cover...like guilds, and how to gain training points.)   May Tunare always guide your way...

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the lands of Norrath and I hope you find fortune and happiness in your travels.  You'll be glad to know there is really all kinds of help available for newcomers and there are lots of longterm players willing to share their knowledge of the realms.  First a shameless plug --  the Q&A column here goes way way back to beta and provides a lot of gameplay information.  There is a search function on the EQ Express site so you can try searching through the Q&A's and see if someone else has had the same question and was lucky enough to get a straight answer without some bard's useless commentary about how nice she'd look in a dress.  The Everquest website also provides a Newbie forum on its message board for questions and you might find it of help.  Also, for very specific questions, your two BEST bets are higher level players of your own race and class and the guides (you can talk to guides and GM's by using the /petition command and then typing a
few lines of text.  If your question is longer than the space available, just wait until the guide /tells back to you and then you can elaborate on your question if need be.)  There is also an online manual in your Everquest folder which needs updating (ahem offers her services), but has some very useful information including a list of the emotes and basic commands in the game.  There's also of course, lots of information on the Everquest fan websites include EQ Vault and EQ Stratics, etc.  Finally, one site I check every once in awhile is an EQ glossary site for just the problem you described.  If you want to know what a train is or what oom means or what the heck a GM is, you might want to take a look at http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm which is nearing 500 definitions at the last count I saw.  By the way (btw), a train is something you always want to get out of the way of as soon as possible unless you like the feel of the pounding feet of dozens of monsters traversing your spine; a GM is a game master and the term applied nearly equally to both the GM's working for Verant and the guides who volunteer to help players.  As far as "chatting" goes, you also might want to look at the help file in the EQ chat room which will give you all kinds of nifty commands to use there.  You can find out more about guilds by going to the EQ website and reading about them and there is also a helpfile in chats accessible by clicking on the Guilds button.  Finally, every character gets training points with each level.  Unless you want to boost a special skill, most people use them carefully and slowly, putting one practice into the skill to learn it and then gaining skill  points by actually using the skill.  Hope this helps some.  Be sure to say hiya if you see me in game!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whats the deal with the fake Neclo who doesn't respond to the quest letter? 
<br><br>
Cadin
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that long ago, the "real" Neclo was in the habit of handing out level 40-something spells when a player did a level 1 quest.  Now this was quite a boon because the low level player could turn around and sell the spell for about 12 plat, which even to this level 25 bard, is a fair amount of money.  Well, one day, the banker in Qeynos was noticing all these rich newbies and ask them if they had found a gold field out in the hills.  They laughed!  Then they finally revealed their highly paid quest.  The banker's eyebrows shot up as he realized that it wouldn't be too long until these upstarts could open their own bank and put him out of business.  Being a not particularly subtle fellow, the banker immediately importuned every passing god and goddess, asking them to please knock some sense into Neclo's head.  Neclo did try to resist the will of the gods, but soon all the gods and goddesses knocked the spells right out of Neclo's head and as a sign of their presence often put a small "!" in front of his name.  This is the false Neclo of which you speak I believe.  It's actually the same Neclo, this time with the mark of the gods upon him, but sadly for those who sought easy wealth or quests, he is unable to speak about the secret knowledge they seek.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been playing EQ since the days of Beta, but am very disappointed in the server I now play on (Prexus).  Hardly anyone is ever in character, there are no events, and well...there are more level 1 warriors in full crafted than you can shake a sword at.  I was just wondering, which server would you recommend as being one of the most active roleplay server, if not the best server you've played on?
<br><br>
Celistrae Moonglow
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a difficult question because it has an easy answer and a more complex one.  The easy answer is that all servers have some roleplayers and some powergamers and you just have to look for the kind of players you want to spend time with.  However, to be more helpful, I thought about it for awhile and would like to make a couple suggestions.  First, if you wish to stay on Prexus, start watching the guilds and how they relate to each other.  Nearly every server has guilds dedicated to role play and you'll have a great time indeed if you can find one on your server.  Second, if you want to change servers, you'll probably find the most active roleplaying on the pvp servers, especially Rallos Zek.  Pvp is an acquired taste I think, so if it doesn't appeal to you I'd suggest you might try hanging out a bit on the very crowded Fennin Ro as it is home to the very entertaining guild, the Soerbaird; the very famous but slightly  younger-than-me Jythri; and several solid roleplaying guilds.  Events, unlike roleplay within a small group, are usually announced on the news boards when a guild or group of players presents one.   GM events are never announced but they do occur.  Just keep your eyes open and if suddenly some strange characters appear, no matter what server you are on,  treat them with interest and curiosity and you may find yourself embarked on quite a role play adventure.  It's good to remember that no matter whether the event is sponsored by players or the GMS,  the more players who roleplay, the more fun for all.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a tip for the Human traveling in Faydwer (although why I would want to help such an inferior race is beyond me).  Perhaps he should take a trip to Steamfont (home of those horrid little Gnomes) .  There are numerous pumas there which have been known to have pelts worthy of making armor out of.
<br><br>
Anian, High Elf Mage of the 4 circle

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for taking the time to write in that elegant script in green ink with gold highlights.  It was quite beautiful indeed.  I'm sure the human will appreciate your kind condescension in supplying the information.  I do appreciate your writing.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Me problem is complex....Me was born a woodie elf in da city Oggok. Me mom was a slave. As a child me was orphan an have no problem wit bouncers. Den when I gets older da bouncers tell me to go or worst dey attaked me.I try to get on der good side but everyone attaked me. Now me is in Crushbone killen da dwarf slaves for faction with da Oggok warrier's but me no know how to get faction wit da bouncers?Any idea how to get da bouncers to like me?One odder problem...before me mom was gone she dedicated me to some stupid woodie elfie god named Tunare and the bouncers tink dat i realy worship da silly ting...sigh
<br><br>
Chankeen
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;While I certainly appreciate your dilemma, Chankeen, I think perhaps it is time for you to travel throughout the world and expand your grammar and vocabulary over the knowledge you gain from the ogres who have taught you.  You might even perhaps seek out long lost wood elf relatives to help you with the transition to high culture and aesthetics from the clomping world of the ogres.  The bouncers attitudes to you so far are a good indication that no matter how hard you try to become part of the welcome scenery of Oggok, the gods themselves may be preventing the very friendships you seek.  Tunare is powerful indeed but it is said that ogres may worship Rallos Zek, Bertoxullus and/or Innoruuk and if the bouncers have chosen one of those gods, then the deities will do all they can to separate you from the ogres.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Druids, shamans, necromancers, magicians and enchanters can all have pets." You forgot ShadowKnights. They can summon a skeleton pet =) -- Well, if you are thinking of pets for druids as in they can charm, then you are also forgetting about us wonderful bards.  We have a song of charming effect that is our 27th.
<br><br>
Dolphin Oceansinger &lt;The Blood of Norrath&gt; Prexus
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my goodness, I can hardly wait for that song.  Do you think its strong enough for me to charm the tailors and dressmakers into making me a wearable dress? That would be marvelous!  Thanks for writing about those I forgot to mention.  I really appreciate it.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, I just have a quick question.  Right now I am lvl 15 and I have about 6 days on my character.  This is a lot in my opinion and it's just going to take even more time at higher lvls.  I know people who made lvl 20 in like 2 days.  To me this is impossible (I also would like to add that I have other characters too, two of them are lvl 20+ and they have at least 11 days on them)  This is a lot compared to osme people, do you have any idea what they are doing better than me, lvling wise?
<br><br>
Lavert
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to the combined Pillars of Wisdom to for help on this as I have umpteen playing days and am still level 25 so I'm no expert on powerlevelling.  The first thing that will affect how fast you level is your race and class and since you didn't specify that, the best I can do is deal with generalities.   Some classes will have experience handicaps that make levelling a slower process than for others.  Bards and other mixed melee/caster classes are usually the hardest hit.  Other race/class combinations will allow for certain benefits.  An example of that would be, for instance, troll warriors, who have much faster regen rates than say, barbarian warriors, and thus may engage lots of mobs faster.  The second factor that will make a different in leveling, is your knowledge of the game.  There are certain zones and certain monsters that give you better experience than other mobs that con at the same level and knowing the areas of good experience will help you level faster.   Like the Pillars said, the time it takes to level can also depend on whether you are soloing or not, what kind of groups you get in, whether you take time to quest for items, and how often you die.  The Pillars do think you are levelling a little bit slower than they would expect and suggest you ask around to gain ideas on where and how to fight more effectively.

<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What real good are different languages?  Aside from reading certain books, why doesn't everyone just stick to common? 
<br><br>
Sevalian
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Languages are used primarily by the mage classes to discover the whereabouts of spells and how to use them, as well as for reading books and scrolls.  I thought about it for a bit though and couldn't think of one npc that spoke anything but common.  I wonder if that's the case.  Most times, people will speak in various languages just for amusement and confounding the listeners, but I understand that on the pvp/race war servers languages that are unintelligible to the opposing side might be helpful.

<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do skills decay over time?  If so, at what rate does it occur? 
<br><br>
Sevalian
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pillars of Wisdom were unanimous in stating that skills do not decay over time, nor do characters age in Everquest.  There were some mumblings from Gesler that blaming faction is always good if your skills seem to be not-quite-adequate, but I really think this is one time where even faction, weird as it may seem, does not affect you as a player.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we Shapeople can buff just aboot any part of a traveler. I can make you faster, stronger, prettier, and er stouter.  But why oh why can I not make one wiser or smarter?  The Gods have made a crock up of this.  I can float, breath water, outrun a cheeta and do other amazing things but I cannot help my (somewhat lower than the little peoples') wiseness.  Och, even the wee priesties can do that!  Valrin is angered at this.  Do not presume to mention 'game balance' or other silliness to Valrin when he has the anger wi' him. (PS and I canna brew t' save me life!!) 
<br><br>
Valrin
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's meet for a drink tomorrow night and commiserate.  Just as I can never understand the cruelty of the creators in making beautiful and talented bards who cannot wear the finest of fashions except in armor, so you will never really find out why the gods stopped at the beneficial skills they bestowed upon you.  We shall toast the wicked fairy of dissatisfaction and perhaps by evening's end, we'll come to appreciate the skills and talents we do have.   Well, that would be good but, honestly, I can't imagine not wanting a dress and I figure you'll always pine a bit for the skills of the "wee priesties".    Now the brewing perhaps I can help you a bit with.  It is said that intelligence will help anyone gain better skills in their chosen crafts.  Next time you decide to go a'brewing, load up on the intelligence equipment you have, and see if that helps the flavor of the ale improve.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Me and me mate bot got brooms in Najena. Whut dey fer??? Sum pipples say de fer qest but which one??Pleeze help.... 
<br><br>
Nukim
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The brooms of Najena can certainly be helpful with the endless dust of Freeport, but if you are skilled enough to find the way to improve the quality of your broom and if you are a magician, you may find that those lowly sweepers may assist you handsomely.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ail Songsmith, this be more a comtary than a question.  I be a Holy Knight o' Brell.  When startin' out, I learnt the value o' usin' a bow.  That, and me need fer royal jelly ta makes mead, 'as taken me inta t' elf tree city.  Now, I hears that t' leader o' t' warriors will reward yas fer bringin' 'im back stuff.  Well, I'm in t' area anyways, so I gets what I 'ear 'e wants.  When I gives it ta 'im, 'e near bites me 'ead off!  Now, I been killin' orcs a plenty!  On that long lonely stretch near me 'omelands, I offen stop ta greets pawns an' show 'em that not only elfs ve archers.  Ye'd think 'e'd be nicer.  Well, I wanders up ta see t' rangers..  Know what?  While not fallin' ta their knees ta 'elp me, they wwas perlite.  Jus' goes ta show: not all elfs is alike.  I be off ta the city o' marble, see iffen things be difrent there... I hopes t' Holy Warriors o' Tunare be nicer!
<br><br>
FrerrinSon of Puddle (Prexus)
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, there are some who refuse to recognize the efforts we go to in order to please them.  I think perhaps it is possible that those warriors might object to your religion or perhaps even your chosen occupation and thus act in such an uncivilized manner.  It's good you were able to move on without death and I do hope the Holy Warriors of Tunare were intrigued and pleasantly surprised by your visit.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made the mistake of killing treants to level.  From about 23 to 29.  Now the druids ofQHills hate me. Holly and Cros.  I am a barbarian.It there a way to fix my faction with them?Thanks! 
<br><br>
Drahcir
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Holly and Cros do seem to have a monopoly on grumpiness at times but there is, according to the Pillars of Wisdom, a way to earn your advancement into their good graces again.   You need to remember that Holly and Cros both detest gnolls and would love to see Blackburrow wiped out on a regular basis.  No one is sure if every gnoll you kill would be equivalent to one treant from your past, but you might as well smite a bunch and see if that does help.
