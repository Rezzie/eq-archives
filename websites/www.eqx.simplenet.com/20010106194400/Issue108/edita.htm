EverQuest was not designed to be a place of business.  It was built to be an entertainment that makes money for those providing the entertainment.  In the same way that sporting events and concerts are designed to be a simple transaction, the customer pays the entertainers so that they will entertain.  Somehow someone threw a monkey wrench into the machinery.  For sports events it's scalpers (and in a small way the ticket agencies), gathering up tickets and reselling them to the audience at inflated prices.  In EverQuest, it's the eBay sellers.
<br><br>
Now I'm not guiltless.  I've done a bit of this myself.  Not in EverQuest, but with Magic: the Gathering.
<br><br>
For those of you that don't really know what I'm talking about, Magic is a card game, with complicated rules and pretty pictures on the cards.  They are essentially just playing cards, not unlike the ones you find at the grocery store.  You purchase these cards in packs of 60, 15 and sometimes 12 (and maybe others, I don't know anymore).  No package contains the same set of cards.  You take the cards you gather from purchasing these packs (or individual cards) and build a deck designed to destroy your opponent.  You cast spells, create monsters and blast your enemy and his monsters.  It is billed as a collectable card game, meaning that you play the game <b>and</b> collect the cards.  Kinda like playing War with baseball cards.
<br><br>
I was one of those that started playing and collecting during the Alpha/Beta stages of the game.  My brother and I became quite aware of the resale value of these little pieces of cardboard early too.  We would order a case of an expansion as cheaply as we could when it first came out, and drop it into the closet.  When the set went out of print and our local game stores would run out, we would find a very good profit selling them to the stores.  Heck, we would even buy them from one particular store and then sell them back to him a few months later at a huge profit.  One box of Arabian Nights boosters that we purchased for about $70 we sold back to the guy we bought it from less than a year later for about $700…
<br><br>
I'm several years older now, and I've realized something; we sucked.  In our own little way we were screwing up the prices of those cards for our fellow players.  Sure one case from each set wasn't changing the global Magic economy that much.  But the net effect was tremendous.  Take a few hundred people in the Los Angeles area alone, times all of the major Magic playing areas across the country, add to that the very dubious retail stores that would do the same thing (hoarding cards for sale at a higher price once the set went out of print), and you could actually feel the prices rising.  If a player didn't get cards from a good set pretty quickly he wouldn't get them at all, or he'd pay outrageous prices later.
<br><br>
Just like EverQuest as it relates to eBay, Wizards of the Coast is also partially responsible for this phenomena.  Wizards at first was just plain overwhelmed by the response to their game.  There are, I think, only about 4,500 of any given rare Alpha edition card.  That's not a lot of cards.  And the demand for those cards is understandably high.  But Wizards also artificially inflates the cost of their product on the secondary market in a few ways.  First of all there are rarities for the cards.  So some cards might show up in any given pack, some will very likely show up, and some most likely won't.  This is something that baseball card companies have been doing for years, so this isn't new.  Wizards also discontinues sets of cards after a time.  This creates another rarity, and often makes the older cards more valuable because they are out of print.  Again, something that has been going on with baseball cards (and any 'collectible', really) for years.
<br><br>
But Magic is not just a collectible, it's a game.  And many of those that want to play the game end up spending a lot of money to do so, especially if they wish to be competitive.  And not unlike EverQuest, if you jump into the Magic community you will see a lot of people asking for, really demanding, a change to this situation (reprinting all older editions, keeping the current sets in print longer…).  And you will see that a lot of people have quit playing because they couldn't keep up, monetarily.  Yes, you can still play the game with the less expensive cards, and it's still fun.  Very similar to EverQuest in many ways.
<br><br>
I have one card, a small piece of inked cardboard, that I could sell in five minutes for over $300.  I could possibly get as much as $500 for it because it is in perfect condition and it actually has a history, and if I take my time and find the right buyer, $500 is possible.
<br><br>
Isn't that insane?
<br><br>
That little piece of cardboard retailed for much less than one dollar.  And because of the way the game is marketed and due to some perhaps less than scrupulous action by some major retailers the game is as much about finding a real life deal (or trade) for the cards you want as it is about sitting down and playing the game.  What started out for me as a very fun game of strategy became a way to make money.  The monetary cost of playing kept most of my friends from playing.  Soon it was only about money and never about playing and having fun.  And shortly after that, it was no longer about anything.  I no longer play.  I've sold everything that anyone wanted, except for my actual collection (and I may sell that soon enough).  I have a job, I don't want one as a hobby too.
<br><br>
The sale of items on EBay has a similar affect on EverQuest.  I'm not going to tell anyone that playing EverQuest just to make money is wrong, that it ruins the game for them.  It may be true, but that's really none of my concern.  They may ruin their own game experience in any way that they see fit.  But they don't have the right to ruin the experience that others have in game, especially just to satisfy some personal greed.
<br><br>
Where Magic has short print runs, EverQuest has fixed spawn sites.  Where Magic has card rarity, EverQuest has item rarity.  The effects on Magic are essentially a higher cost to play the game competitively, in EverQuest we have items camped to exclusion, kill stealing, twinking and a serious destruction of the idea that EverQuest is a role-playing game.  Yes, people will camp, twink and kill steal regardless of the status of the sale of items outside of the game.  But the volume of these instances and the nature of them have certainly been affected by eBay sales.
<br><br>
Now Verant has put out an official-type announcement saying that they don't like the external sale of EverQuest items and characters (unlike that complete nut-job Richard Garriot…).  However, they have no plans to do anything about it because…  drum roll… they don't have the resources to police the Internet.
<br><br>
That's such a tremendous cop-out.
<br><br>
They certainly had time and energy enough to stomp out that Guide Handbook (something I applaud them for).  If they ask for it from their players they will never lack for a list of ongoing eBay and other EverQuest item sales.  I'm quite certain that someone, given any encouragement by Verant, would spend the time to compile and maintain a list of current eBay items and web sites selling EverQuest items for real life cash.  And eBay would certainly help out, it is one of their policies to help stop the sale of just this sort of thing.  I don't doubt that it would only take the filling out of one form and one letter from a lawyer to set up a method for getting eBay to delete the sale of items from EverQuest.  Set up that method and Verant could probably shut down each auction with a single e-mail, and probably several at a time.
<br><br>
Then, obviously, many independent auctions would show up on personal web sites.  Those are easily shut down.  Hell, even Dr. Twister closed up his UO shop when presented with a mound of company law-dogs.  One letter to any of these sites from Verant and they'll shut down or go underground.  An underground auction site isn't going to work too well.
<br><br>
*sigh*
<br><br>
I'm so very disappointed that Verant tells us that they don't like this terrible trend but that they are unwilling to put the effort into doing something about it.  Such a task could easily justify the retainers that they pay their legal staff.  Don't tell us that you are against real sales of virtual EverQuest items if you don't mean it.  Lord British proved himself to be a moron with his recent comments about <b>wanting</b> future Ulitma games to support real life sales.  What Verant is doing is worse.  They're being insincere, they are indicating that they are willing to talk the talk, but not walk the walk.
<br><br>

P.S. - I don't know if this will matter if Verant is unwilling to work with eBay to stop the sale of items, but you can fill out what eBay calls a <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/services/safeharbor/report-infringing.html">Community Watch Report</a>.  It's a way that we can bring to their attention 'a Potentially Illegal or Infringing Item'.
<br><br>
P.P.S. - <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/">Lum the Mad</a> said something recently on his site that I liked a lot.  I don't usually quote other sites, or link to them, but I'll make an exception for this.  He was rating the top ten disappointments of 1999, here was his number one:
<br><br>
<em><b>1: IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS, BABY (ALL)</b>
<br><br>
No, Richard, the corruption of an environment is <b>not</b> "cool". 
<br><br>
The worst excesses of every online game can be traced to one word - eBay. The worst customer support incident? GM Darwin, creating shake and bake towers and gold for resale on eBay. The worst player scandal in UO? Guilds that dupe gold for resale on eBay. The worst playability problem in EQ? The item farmers that block every lucrative camp so that they can sell the proceeds on eBay.
<br><br>
This is <b>the</b> problem that ORPGs need to stare down in 2000. As long as items or property or skills are so rare/difficult/impossible to obtain that an obscenely high real world value is attached to them, those that see an opportunity to make a profit will do so - to the detriment of those who simply want to play the game. And those who simply want to play the game will find games to play that don't involve competing with those who see them as a brilliant career move.</em>
