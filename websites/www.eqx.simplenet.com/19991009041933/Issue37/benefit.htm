Within a twilit glade, where water dripped from oak leaves to strike the sodden detritus far below, a weasel scurried.  It nosed into the undergrowth, searching perhaps for food, perhaps a place to rest.  Its erratic movements disturbed a bird as it pushed its nose into a bush, and as the bird flittered past it in a burst of twittering, the weasel leaped back, somewhat astounded by the sudden outburst.  Its head turned in quick movements as it looked to the canopy, trying to find where the bird had landed.  Unsuccessful in its searching, it began once more to probe its nose into the deep thickleberry bush.
<br><br>
	Suddenly, in burst of speed beyond reflex, something within the bush moved -reaching, grasping - and the weasel was gone.  In its place was nothing more than a line of blood, and the faint echo of its mew as it died was but a fading memory in the glade.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
	The following morning, when beams of sunlight squirmed their way through the high canopy, a child meandered about the small forest.  Winter was fast approaching, and a chill was in the air, so as the young girl pulled her grey cloak tight about her shoulders and thread her dirt coloured hair beneath her clothing she fervently wished she'd worn her hood.  Her father had granted her permission to walk in the woods this morning, as he did many mornings; the girl enjoyed to pick the wildflowers that grew in the shadow of the ancient oaks and beech to lay upon the grave of her mother, beside the small cottage she and her father lived in.  She did not know how her mother had died, nor did she truly recall who her mother was; she had died when the girl was no more than a toddler.  Now, at the age of six, she could not recall such distant memories, even though she still honoured her mother's grave with flowers.
<br><br>
	As she skipped through the trees, beams of sunlight flickering across her eyes, she caught sight of a beautiful blue flower resting high upon a stem.  She skipped across to it, and drew in its heady scent before plucking it from the ground and placing it in the deep sack upon her shoulder.  Already she had found more flowers than she had in many mornings, and she silently wondered at her good fortune.
<br><br>
	As she looked up from her sack she noticed a bush in a glade adorned with a mass of small white flowers, and as she skipped towards it she vaguely recalled that her father had referred to a similar looking plant a thickleberry.
<br><br>
	As she neared the place and where it rest, and reached down to pick a most perfect white blossom, adorned in dew and glistening in a beam of light, a young voice suddenly called from behind her. 
<br><br>
	"Oh, do be careful!  A - ah - an associate of mine lives in burrow beneath this plant, girl, and I doubt he would welcome your trespassage."
<br><br>
	The girl turned, somewhat startled by a strange voice in her forest, and even more startled when she saw it was a naked boy.  By her inexperienced estimate, the boy was younger than ten, perhaps by two years.  "Who are you?" she asked in a curious voice, "And why are you wearing no clothes."
<br><br>
	The boy smiled.  "I'm from around these parts.  You're right, though, I should be wearing something, shouldn't I?  You're kind always do, and this body does feel rather cold.  I did not realise you're kind were so weak!"
<br><br>
	The girl's curiosity grew even higher as the boy's strange words, and her eyebrows tightened as she said "Would you like to have my sack?  It's very big, and you're very skinny."
<br><br>
	The boy nodded, his eyes attentive.  "Yes."  He took a couple of steps closer to the girl and took the sack she offered him, devoid of the flowers which she now held under her arm.  Tying it around his waist, he looked at the girl again, and wondered at this opportunity.  Only last night he had taken this body, and already he was seeing the benefits it held over his old goblin body.  Yet he felt something had gone astray with his well wrought spell, although he could not say exactly what it was.  He squinted and the sunlight that was suddenly upon him, and took a step back, saying "Girl, do you know this area well?"
<br><br>
	She nodded.
<br><br>
	"Could you tell me where you live?"
<br><br>
	"I live that way, in a cottage with Father."  She pointed the north.
<br><br>
	"Ah, is he a large man?"
<br><br>
	The girl nodded vigorously, her eyes wide.  "Yes, he's very strong.  He hunts deer with his arrows, and carries them all the way back home on his shoulders!"
<br><br>
	As the goblin pondered what advantage this could lend him, a sudden impulse took him to reach out and touch the girl before him.  Not one to fight instinct, he let his hand settle upon the girl's shoulder.  And as he touched her a sudden sound, like the clashing of hail against rock, filled his ears.  His mind filled with sharp images of magic icons and the weft of the ether appeared before his eyes.  The goblin, compared to some, was not well versed in such arcane matters, but he somehow understood the link between what was occurring to him and the spell he had cast the night before.  A sure understanding came to him, and, almost unaware, he began to sing.
<br><br>
	The cry of pain from the girl beside him was unheard by the goblin-boy.  At first, her cry was one of simple pain, her shoulder feeling crushed beneath the boy's tightening grip.  But as the boy began to sing his song of discord, her cry turned to one of agony beyond the physical.
<br><br>
	Then the boy turned, his other hand grasping onto her free shoulder, and he held her fast as his eyes, fey and unhuman, bore into her's.  There was such incredible will and evil behind those eyes that she could not break her gaze from them.
<br><br>
	The volume of the boy's song rose to a volume louder than a human's capabilities, and the forest was filled with it, the girl's scream becoming a frightening underharmony.  And with a sigh of relief, her soul slipped from her body, and began to float heavenward.
<br><br>
	The song continued.  Then, as fast as it had been the night before, it was over.  The alarmed calls of the forest birds began to settle, and the silence of the crisp morning returned.
<br><br>
	The creature of the thickleberry would have gifted the girl with a far swifter death, but misplaced trust in a human face had caused her a death of pain beyond reckoning.
<br><br>

	<br>
	The girl blinked.  She arose from where she had been lying upon the ground, dropped as the goblin-boy finished his song, and tried to find her feet.  The goblin felt ill-used, having to again learn to work a new body, and he began to complain quietly.
<br><br>
	Suddenly, the goblin-girl heard a man's voice call loudly from the distance, a name.  The goblin-girl looked about, and saw its previously body lying upon the ground.  Mustering its limited coordination and tiny strength, it hurriedly pulled the dead boy towards the thickleberry bush.  The goblin-girl began to hear footsteps accompanying the calls, and knew the strong hunter was drawing closer on long human legs.  Then, just as the man entered the glade, the thickleberry shook, and the boy was gone.
<br><br>
	"Alicia!  Are you alright?"  The man's voice was deep, filled with concern.
<br><br>
	The goblin-girl smiled.  "I'm fine, Father.  Can we go home?"
<br><br>
	The man nodded.  "Yes. Come along."  He held out his hand, and his little girl took it.  Together, they began to walk back towards the cottage.
<br><br>
	If only he had noticed the fey glint in her eyes...
