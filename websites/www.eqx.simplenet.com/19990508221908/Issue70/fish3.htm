<em>More from my piscatorial playmates…</em>

Dear Oghma,
<br><br>
	I am an enthusiastic Wood Elf Bard Fisherman. My favorite spot for fishing would have to be the Kaladim docks. There are 3 docks there, and you get a great view of the sunset and sunrise, plus I am surrounded by the wilderness. The docks are also the foreign quarter of Kaladim, and there are many shops around the docks that are owned by many other races from Faydwer. I like hearing them tell some of the dwarves to bugger off and then start slapping around the necromancers and shadow knights. 
<br><br>
	If you are looking for a tangy treat, go to Ak'Anon. Try fishing in their little lake, you might be surprised. Eating the fish there leave me with a healthy glow. The meat pops and crackles in your mouth. If you are not interested in an exotic treat, I wouldn't recommend it, though. It is too noisy and their is smoke coming from their factories.
<br><br>
	If you want relaxing, I would recommend Surefall glade. Behind the waterfall is a very relaxing spot with the sound of the water and the mist. The bears are visually pleasing, but if you are not friendly to nature, they are definitely not physically pleasing. The poachers are definitely annoying, too. If it weren't for them this spot would probably be my favorite, me being from the forest and all. :)
<br><br>
	When I am in a relaxing spot, I start to sing (I am a bard, remember). I play my mandolin and flute and fill the air with the sweet sound of music. The fish enjoy it, too, and I am able to bring in a huge load.
<br><br>
	Sincerely,
<br><br>
	Aastreal, Wood Elf Bard

Oghma,
  <br><br>
    Bladestump here, writing in to tell ye of my favorite fishing spot.  Forget all that outdoors stuff! The true dwarven fishermen does his fishing in the proper place...underground.  Ye have never seen such fishing as ye will find in Kaladim.  The underground stream that runs through several sections of the city is well-stocked with a wide variety of tasty, blind cavefish.  There is even an underground dock near the Everhot Forge, though why those Everhot's build a dock to a river with no boats I will never know, it sure does make a great spot for fishing!  There are also several small bridges which are great to fish off, saying hail to all who pass by.  Even the guards will stop and talk with a dwarven fisherman, and sometimes join ye when their shift be over.  So get the annoying sun off yer neck and lose the sound of chirping birdies in the blasted trees...come to Kaladim, where the fishing is best by far!

Allow me to introduce myself, I am Sumbus. I am a journeyman warrior gnome of the Gemchopper's guild. Many do not realize it but fishing is a fine art!
<br><br>
I started as a casual fisher, no different then any other I suppose. I quickly rose above my friends in skill, and now I'm a better fisherman then fighter! Whilst I do like fishing on the docks, the hubbub can get to me, and often I seek out serenity.
<br><br>
Serenity comes to me on the Isle of Erollisi Marr. What better place to fish then under the passionate eye of the Queen of Love! It is quite simple to get there, you just board the boat at Freeport or Kaladim, and wait. Once you get to the island with the kindly lady on it, you're there! It is a serene environment devoid of dangers at the heart of the Ocean of Tears.
<br><br>
I'm glad to see many other fishing enthusiasts, and I find fishing the most relaxing thing to do!
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Sumbus

Well, bein a lil gnome wizzie, I choose to fish (strategic decision of course) when the minotaur Hero is out and about... since he one-shot's me...and when I'm broke which is often.  There's a spot inside Ak'Anon near the Priest of Discord (he's not the talkative sort so easy to ignore) by a waterfall that is very peaceful.  Some have mentioned a possible quality problem with the fish coming out of that lil lake but I've found them to be pure and tasty.  I, also, practice my sense heading skill while I fish.

Greetings!  My name is Celestine, and my favorite place to fish is the small pond in North Qeynos which serves as an outlet to the aqueducts.  I have met a number of wonderful people there, and began to joke about starting a guild, the Flying Fish Masters.  Well, what ended up happening -- all because of my willingness to spend some time fishing -- is that I am in the process of creating a guild called the Honor Guard.  At any rate, not only do I meet people, but I can watch people swim, enter, and emerge from the aqueducts, so it breaks up the monotony when the fish aren't biting.  I do sometimes need to remind them not to scare the fish.
  <br><br>
Another pleasant advantage afforded by fishing is that I have time to practice my Erudian, which I just gained as part of my training as a Paladin.  So, I can sit back, fish for an hour or two, and have a conversation with someone who has seen shores and sights beyond what I have myself.
  <br><br>
I would just like to extend an invitation to all would-be fishers out there: There is so much more to do in Norrath than pester gnolls and slay snakes that it is wise to develop a hobby or two.  Fishing is one that I highly recommend, and I hope that you have the opportunity to meet new friends as much as catch a fish or two.

Good morrow melodramatic missives..
<br><br>
Surely the pond in Felwithe has to be the finest fishing ground to be found. The clear blue crystal waters breed healthy and above all large catch. No piranha's, no sharks to nibble at your bait, and above all it's a wonderful, social place in which to sit back (careful of the sodden, beer stained grass), and chat to travelers. There are marvels to behold nearby, and a convenient 'Fish & bait' store right next to the pond in which one can sell one's catch, buy more bait.. all within arms reach.
<br><br>
A number of citizens have written in to detail the way they pass the time while fishing, such as practicing skills and spells etc. While an admirable pursuit, surely this takes away from the ideal of fishing.. which is relaxation, and enjoyment. To be rummaging around in the bushes foraging while your hook bobs and wiggles is quite.. quite.. unprofessional. Furthermore.. The practicing of spells is, in my opinion, ridiculously rude. Not only does it scare the fish, but it disturbs those other anglers who're looking for some peace and quiet. One can practice spells in the guild house my friends.. Similar sentiments for those who insist on jumping into the pool and swimming through its depths. It's a fitting reprise that I snag your sandals, and sundry equipment.. Woe betide I snag your shiny breastplates...
<br><br>
While Felwithe's pond isn't the quietest, it's one of the friendliest fishing grounds I've come across.. the number of travelers there means you always have someone to talk to, and you'll often find me perched on the little outcropping just inside the entrance.

Being a Gnome in the land of humans is not always easy, let me tell ya! Many the time I get barbarian ruffians jumpin over me head, or Half Elves tellin me how cute I am.  Sometimes a gnome just needs to get away from all the bustle and fuss of the Taller's big city livin. That's why me favorite place to fish has always been sneakin under the docks.  No one bothers ye down there t'all, and if you really want yer privacy, a quick cast of invisibility and its no more short jokes fer hours!. If those too talls only knew I was tall fer me age hee hee.

Dear Oghma,
  <br><br>
    Fishing is a wonderful pasttime of which find myself doing quite frequently!  Where do I fish?  Why in the port section of Freeport!  I love to go under the docks and fish away, sometimes having interesting and profound conversations with the Barbarian there, that seems to love fishing more than I!  Selling my precious catch is also quite easy and profitable here as well, for I get almost up to 3 silver per catch!  Sometimes I'll fish from afternoon till night, watching the sunset create the most extraordinary, and most brilliant colors on the sea and more oft than not, I'll fish from night till morn, basking in the cool rays of the moon.  It's one of the more relaxing things to do that I can think of as well as being profitable and I recommend it to all that enjoy a good sport and a pretty coin in their purse!
  <br><br>

Greetings, Oghma
  <br><br>
I thought I'd just let you know that the best place to fish in Qeynos is _not_ at the docks, but rather the pond in North Qeynos, in front of Crow's.  I realized this after attempting to fish from the docks and getting only one puny minnow and moldy pair of sandals, using up all five baits I had bought in the process.
  <br><br>
The pond is really quite serene, and one can wistfully watch the day pass by as fish after fish practically jump into your arms.  The sounds of the monks practicing their martial studies in their guildhall are rather soothing, as well.
  <br><br>
The one drawback?  Well, like I said, it's situated in front of Crow's.  I don't really like the look of the shady characters that frequent the place.  Not to mention that fool, Moodoro, who, when he's not casting spells that scare the fish, can often be seen stumbling out the door, leaving a rather distasteful trail of regurgitation behind him.  He's the only Erudite I know, which leaves me with a not-so-wonderful impression of those people.
  <br><br>
Anyway, I love to fish there, and I often cast an illusion on myself that makes me look like a lamppost, gleefully confusing onlookers that are new to the city (or are just plain not very bright).  The one thing I just cannot figure out: I am a strict teetotaler (alcohol has never touched these lips, nor shall it ever) and I can never understand who keeps spilling beer on me when I retrieve my line.
