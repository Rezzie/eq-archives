My online character is a mighty mage.  With the aid of my awesome magical energy, others can accomplish their quests for a small fee.  I have mapped out most of the dungeons, and know my way around fairly well.  I have become a familiar name to other adventures, and am talked about in tales.  I can even teach others how to conquer a dragon.

By now my wife has taken the kids, and left me.  I’m in trouble for sleeping on the job at work.  At the house unpaid bills are stacking up on the kitchen table.  The house is littered with pizza boxes, and other take-out food containers.  Laundry that will never get washed grows in large piles everywhere.    My body has gone to hell, as I never find time to work out anymore.  I’ve gained over seventy pounds in the hindquarters.  My only friends are online, as I don’t have time for any real life friends and… <em>the list goes on.</em>

So that is my schedule for this year.  I am all set for the start of this awaited magnificent occasion.  I have upgraded my machine, increased my bandwidth, and ordered 100 lbs. of coffee for those long days at work after sleepless nights.  I joined Weight Watchers, and contacted my lawyer for my upcoming divorce.
