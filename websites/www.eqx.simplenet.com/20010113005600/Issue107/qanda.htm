<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Nep, I enjoy reading your column with much interest each week.  My question -- what is your take on various guilds?  I was trying to explain to a fellow traveler of Norrath the other night how to find a guild and what are up some good and bad qualities.  I figured the sage of bards would have a good response.  Also, are you in a guild ? 
<br><br>
Relseg
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a question for an entire article I think, but I'll take a quick crack at it for now.  Guilds have been in Norrath since ancient times (i.e., beta when they were first developed and tested) and have espoused all sorts of reasons for existing.  I think that the first step in finding a guild, unless you want to try to start a fresh one, is to first figure out what you'd like in a guild.  Do you want powerlevelling and cool equipment fast?  Do you want a guild involved in creative quests and roleplay?  Do you want a huge guild with a lot of structure or do you want a group of dependable friends with minimal hierarchy?  Once you have an idea of the kind of people you want to hang around with and the kind of playstyle you want to use, then I'd suggest you learn as much as you can about the various guilds on your server.  For me, I tend to judge a guild on how they treat non-members, figuring if they are reasonably kind and informative to people outside the guild, then the atmosphere inside the guild will generally be friendly and supportive, which is something I look for.   You can find out if the guild has a website and visit it and you can chat with guildmembers and see if they are taking new members and what they are looking for.   Finally,  you can watch how the guild as a whole and its individual members operate on your server?  Does it demean other guilds?  Does it create dissension and fighting over non-roleplay issues?  Will it  pitch in on corpse retrievals for anyone who needs it?  What is its attitude toward loot and camping?  Do members actively hog zones for gaining equipment to sell on EBay?  Finally, what is a guild's reputation among players on your server?  That will tell you a lot before you ever make a decision about joining an organization.  You might even talk to the GM or older guides (you'd have to petition and ask for one), and ask them about the guild you're interested in and whether they have any kind of server-wide reputation.  
<br><br>
For me, the ability to trust my guildmates is the main quality I look for in a guild so we can all enjoy the game and not have to worry about guild politics or greed.  Also, I look for a guild whose members see me as having something to offer even though I'm not a terrific gamer.  (Have I ever told you about how often I get lost?)   A guild that will stop everything to help one of its members achieve a new skill or finish a quest and where everyone in the guild can feel that they can call for help and be sure of getting it, is important to me.   For instance, Tagad, a Pillar of Wisdom and a leader of my guild, has spent countless hours helping people learn to play better, teaching them about their class and how to play it even when he could have been putting in all that time just leveling.  And, just the other night, my fellow guildmember Sylvos went off and got himself killed and then stuck in a bugged area just because my habitual chatter and a momentary lack of attention led me off a bridge into the lava and I couldn't get my corpse back.  I do hope I contribute too by being in my guild as a friend to all its members, willing to listen and chat and be there for them, even though at level 24 I don't have a lot to offer unless they want to hang around watching the little goblins chomp away at my toes and whatever other bardly parts they can reach.
<br><br>
Any guild that squabbles constantly over equipment or power is not going to be fun.  I would definitely avoid a guild that wasn't willing to help make Norrath a better place for all who play there.   I would also run screaming away from a guild where inflated egos and meanness were the norm; where blacklisting and bickering characterized its interactions with other players,  and where "beating the game" was the commonly accepted illusion.  After all, bards don't beat games, they just write bad poetry about them!
<br><br>
This has turned into a long answer indeed, but, yes, I am in a guild on Veeshan server and am very glad to be part of it.  It was formed as a guild of friends and has added friends of friends, spouses and significant others, and new friends found on the server.   We sometimes have squabbles and sometimes big frustrations because our members go from very low levels to 50 and grouping is hard to do, but everyone in it wants to be part of a guild that has fun, helps its members and contributes to Norrath, so I'm pretty lucky to be part of it.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two questions, 1.  When the new expansion comes out, Verant says that anyone who doesn't buy the expansion just won't be able to travel to the new continent, and if they were on a boat headed there, they'd just be teleported back. What about the new lizard men characters though?  Obviously you wouldn't be able to play as one, but what if you ran into one on the main continent or something? What would it show?  Also, I keep hearing about the alt.games.everquest discussion group, but when I try to get into it with the discussion group thing in Netscape, it doesn't work.   What do I have to do?
<br><br>
~Nitto, 10th season Druid, Vallon Zek
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be able to see the lizard characters just fine even if you can't travel to the new zones in the expansion.  My understanding from Tagad, a Pillar of Wisdom, is that the graphics will be patched into the current EQ so that seeing lizards or interacting with them in the original Norrath will be possible.    On your second question, I'm not a knowledgeable user of newsgroups but the main EQ website says the following,  "<em>The world of EverQuest is always evolving, due in part to discussion groups and forums devoted to EverQuest. If you would like to get involved with an active EverQuest discussion group, open up your news reader and head on over to the EverQuest forum at news://news.avault.com/forum.everquest hosted by Avault. You can also participate in live EverQuest chat on EFNet, channel #everquest. We're also on usenet under <b>alt.games.everquest</b>.  And, of course, there are the EverQuest message boards here on The Station</em>"   I'm sorry I don't use Netscape so I can't explain how to get to usenet but perhaps some kind soul will write in and explain it.  If so, I'll be sure to pass the word along -- all in a day's work of a bard!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any low level npcs (8-12) that yield a magical weapon or armor.  If there are, where do they start?   
<br><br>
Binren
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the pickings are pretty slim, to use a colloquialism from the hills, but you might want to try some questing for low level armor from npcs.  Frogloks are a good npc group for a lower level monk to fight as they do yield some magical armor for monks but the fruits of the fight are not particularly useful for other classes.  You might want to try quests to see about a weapon, but if you desire a decent magical one, save your copper and travel to a supplier of the magical combine weapons when your purse is full.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have found (2) Superior Lion Skins.  What are the uses for these?  Quest?  Tailoring something?  I see a lot of Low Quality, Medium Quality and High Quality skins that are used for various things but I've never seen or heard of anyone using the Superior Skin for anything.  They came from named lions in the Karanas.  
<br><br>
Blixx BloodThorn of Karana Server   
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Adlerune, one of the Pillars of Wisdom, hemmed and hawed trying to remember if there was a quest in Kithicor that required the Superior Lion Skins but was interrupted by a fight for his life, so I never did get a definitive answer.   If you don't find a quest in Kith, you might want to track down tailoring books and see if they show new tailoring skills that might require these special skins.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Griswel.  I know all.  Well, almost all.  Are there any recipes implemented for the new zone-specific foraged items?  Inquiring minds want to know. 
<br><br>
Griswel
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Verant sometimes keeps inquiring minds guessing (which all inquiring minds enjoy doing).  Tagad, a Pillar of Wisdom just back from celebrating the winter holidays, added this comment about the developers, "…They're crazy and like to add neat stuff without always letting us find out the easy way."   At least I think that is what he said, because he raced away across the fields checking to see what might have been added while he was gone and I wasn't sure I heard him exactly right.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that the spell Inner Fire (shaman, lvl 1), heals even more than the lvl 9 heal spell?
<br><br>
Mcbarky da barb
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the effect of Inner Fire at low levels does give you more hitpoints than a level 9 heal spell, if I understand it correctly.  However, it is important to distinguish that it is not an official healing spell but is giving hitpoints as part of defensive buffing.  All good mages and part-mages will use whatever spells are at their disposal to survive however, so no one would blame you if you avoided certain death by casting Inner Fire.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the highest levels of faction and how do they show as the message?  I am viewed warmly in Qeynos and wonder if there is a higher level of faction.  Thanks.  
<br><br>
Andrewel Aduros,  Rodcet Nife Server
<br><br>
Vakor
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The last list I have is from players responding to a similar question in a much earlier issue.  I believe the levels of faction are described as follows: warmly, judges you kindly, amiably, indifferently, apprehensively, dubiously, threateningly, scowls at you ready to attack.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you enter the arena in Freeport and Qeynos it is considered a PvP Area.  Do the PvP rules stand with the winner getting to pick an item off the loser if the match ends up in death?
<br><br>
Barnes [Raptors] 19th Season Tribunal Server
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is that for those who like to test their mettle and their metal, the city arenas are an excellent spot in which to fight.  However, I believe that non-pvp rules still apply there and that looting a fallen corpse by the winner is not allowed and that no experience is gained.  One of my Pillars of Wisdom reminded me of the Battle of Veeshan and the ensuing murderous chaos in the Freeport arena saying that he couldn't recall that any looting was possible in the arena.  This of course would not apply to pvp players.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I was wondering how much different do the high lvl Enchanters Pet look and Why we don't get to control them? I mean it sucks that your pet is the reason a high lvl mob jumped on your group.
<br><br>
Kjaza
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Rosethorn and Crystalwind, I have a bit of an answer for you.  Essentially, high level enchanter's pets look about the same but they can dual wield and carry a shield.  They also told me that enchanter pets apparently also have a permanent "follow me" mode, so they will jump into a fray if you get hit.  Hope this helps some.
<br><br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How many characters can you have in your last name?  And can you have things like spaces or capitals in the middle of your last name? Thanks.
<br><br>
Ziyal
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, now this is intriguing.  I hereby announce a contest to find the longest name in Norrath.  (Of course the prize isn't much -- a mere mention of your honorable name in this column, but it will be fun to see what everyone can find!)  My understanding is that there is a limit on the number of characters you can have for a first and last name and that coding restricts a name to somewhere around 20 to 22 characters.  The EQ naming rules do not allow spaces in your last name nor do they allow you to create a title for yourself in place of a surname.  I believe a second capital is allowed if you have an apostrophe in your last name (as many of the elven peoples do), and perhaps the clans of Halas are allowed a second capital but I'm not sure on that one.  While on the subject of names, wouldn't it be great if people with creatively interesting roleplay names were given an experience bonus and those with grossly offensive names were thrown into lava where they would be reborn with a proper Norrathian name.  Grin, just a little bardic daydream!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Nep:  My question is, why on Norrath did you refer to Karana as a "she" in issue 105? As best I can ascertain, Karana is male, taking on the appearance of a wise old prophet or shaman. I was never under the impression he was anything but. However, because I have not yet seen him with my own eyes, I cannot bear this as the absolute truth. Do you know something I don't?  
<br><br>
Famien Firefox, Ranger of Karana
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh dear, Karana is going to send deluges to muddy my path for years to come.  How COULD I have said such a thing?  If there is no column next week, you'll know I am wandering the world trying my darndest to propitiate a very angry and very male god.  Thanks for the correction, by the way!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question, but an answer...someone asked what there was not to like about a bards' songs, and I have an answer.  As a rogue, I often use Hide and Sneak to avoid conflicts that would be over my head...if a bard plays a song while you're hiding, you automatically stop hiding upon hearing it.  this can get you killed if a bard is careless with their songs.  (Other than that, I love grouping with bards.) 
<br><br>
Andrel
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it does sound like you have a point there.  Seeing that bards and rogues have a certain affinity for each other, may I take this opportunity to urge all bards to please be careful with your songs and likewise urge all rogues to offer a quick smile and a cold drink to bards to remind them that you need a little consideration too.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question, a response: for pickling, you use the meat, spices, and a jar of sauce. You don't need a jar despite what the recipe books say.
<br><br>
Jaena of Brell Serillis
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the information on pickling.  I do hope you have a container for whatever you pickle though.  It would be so messy in the bottom of a backpack.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll let you off the hook this time.  My evil step-sister Yisbeni says I am too nice and that I should teach you a lesson.  But, as you are well aware, that is not my way.  Let me know when and where you want to share a drink and a tale and I will join you for an evening of festivities. Your friendly wizard.
<br><br>
Ardel i'Fallegar
<br><br>
PS:. So have any of your pillars of wisdom (and intelligence) figured out what my last name means yet?  :)
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heartiest greetings to you and I will watch for you when the sun sets and the innkeepers set out the first round of the evening's libations.  As for tales, I expect a good one from you soon, my friend.  And as for the Pillars, well you may have stumped them on this one, but let's give them an extra week or two, just in case.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What, if anything, did EQ do for X-Mas last year? What all have they done for holidays in the past, anyway?  I'd like to see some events occur over the holidays during PEAK times. (I just hope on Halloween they NEVER make BEGGARS night, unless it's begging from NPCS, not PCs)  Ahhh, the GMs are too lazy to do such a thing, anyway! The only way anything would prolly get done is if it was by players. . .  
<br><br>
Haddread of Fennin Ro
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Vault archives, I was able to find some evidence of a visit to Norrath from Santug Claugg, an ogre who apparently shared small tokens of the holidays.  I missed him myself, but then again, I would definitely look askance at any foodstuffs coming out of the hands of an ogre.  I would never know if it is long-lost elven cousin Jianen being handed to me to nibble on.  Before you are too hard on Verant or the GM's though, it's good to consider that while many players enjoy ingame references to real life holidays and occasions, other players come to the world of Norrath and want to stay within its particular cosmology and its customs.  It is true the religions and customs of this nearly-yearling realm are still quite undeveloped,  but if you watch the events and histories unfolding, I think you'll find that the GMs are busy building the culture and community of the world on a regular basis.  It is really great when players create events and stories too and we'll all have richer roleplay lives if we support the players and guilds who work so hard to make Norrath come alive.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am having problems with Denons lvl 18 song.   I cant find a Brass instrument, and the ones I have (Mino Horn and unfinished Horn), don't seem to work.   What is up? 
<br><br>
Buadan the Bard (HEF)
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure why you are having problems here but Denon's song is notoriously hard to get started as you need pretty decent brass playing skills to make it work and even better ones to have it be reliable.  Other bards have told me a good way to raise your skill is to find a quiet corner where you aren't likely to aggro something that will kill you and practice your instrument.  As for the brass instruments themselves, I haven't tried playing the minotaur horn.  I just carry a lowly horn from the bard's guild and it seems to play reasonably well.  I haven't tried to finish an unfinished horn but you might want to do that as well and see what happens.  There are rumors that Vox carries a magical horn but that will have to wait for us both until we are strong enough singers to pay a visit to her.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A question about dual wield. Does the delay of my main hand decide how often there is a check for my dual wield skill or is it the delay in my off hand? 
<br><br>
Querdikatis
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tagad, the available Pillar of Wisdom, told me that the check should be in your off hand as that is what is swinging and it would be logical for the check to be with your second hand weapon.  This, of course, though, would depend upon the coding.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is up with elementals?  How come they are so stubborn?  All of a sudden they walk off and bring back creatures you'll get killed by.  That is not control.  Could you give me a reason for this?  Thanks and Merry Christmas.
<br><br>
Ceenla
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You might want to make a "back off" button/hotkey to use when your pet looks like it's going to wander.   I'm not sure of all the reasons for a pet wandering, but one possible reason (other then it simply not liking you) is pathing.  If your route is straight over a sand dune, for instance, it  doesn't mean that the pet has the same pathing too... so it will find the pathing node that leads around it, and possibly bring whatever agro monsters it runs into to you.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a young paladin that has heard many rumors of the fiery avenger.  Is this weapon real, and what are its stats? 
<br><br>
Vincent
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes this weapon is real and a long time ago, I remember seeing its flame from a distance.  Upon running to see what it was, I discovered Aradune, flaming sword in hand, standing in the midst of Lavastorm, staring out over the wastes as if pondering the state of the world.  He wouldn't let me hold it -- why, I don't know as I smiled very prettily and promised him a song someday -- so I can't tell you what the stats are.  For that, only Aradune knows ……!  (Well unless he told someone and they told someone and then that someone told someone, but no one has told me so I'm not in the line of someones.)
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail and well met! First may I say, Milady, your rebuttals are impeccable and a joy to read. On to my question. I am in the 12th season as a Paladin and primarily use my 1 handed skill while my partner, a Ranger, uses his 2 handed skill.  Our respective skills are in the mid 60's now, and alas we realized the neglect toward our opposite skills.  My question is this, when I use my 2 handed and he his 1 we don't see our skill improving at all.  And believe me we have been doing this for a good deal of time (actually the Ranger has seen his kick go up several times).  So how do we get the backup skills to rise into the area of our primary?  Thanks to you and your Pillars in advance.
<br><br>
Trufanus
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your compliment.  I'm not sure what you did to prepare for raising this skill, but the thing you have to remember is when you want skills to increase you must fight blue or higher mobs on the /con chart.   Another thing to take into consideration is... did you put at least one point into the skill?  You skill can still raise from 0 to 1 but it will take MUCH longer this way usually.   A Pillar of Wisdom also adds the suggestion of finding some very low delay weapons and slugging it out with some blue creatures.  I hope you find these suggestions will help raise your skills..
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dears Neppy, Okk 'ave answer, nut queeston, to da riddle dat was in da udder piece'a EQX paper. Da kast metal o Paul am a big ol' axe like dat Paul Bunyons on me feet guy! so git a big ol' axe! 'ave a dood day! PZ. gnomies nut am cute, deys am nummy nummy nummy in me tummy! mmm... jest like mommy used ta makes...
<br><br>
Okk
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh if I could only use your language in the charming way you do, but I won't succumb to the temptation to try to raise my ogre-speak skills here as they would pale beside your delightful words.  Thank you for scribbling to me and passing on your answer to the riddle posed in an earlier issue of EQ Express.  Even though I like to admire gnomes rather than munch them, you're a lucky ogre to have such a good mommy cook to please your palate.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pssst... Just wanted to tell you one thing I noticed.  Some of the pet commands you posted aren't exactly right.  For example it is /pet who is the leader as opposed to /pet whos the leader (which doesn't work)  Also you might mention that all of these pet commands do not work on a charmed pet.  =) 
<br><br>
Vast
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks so much for writing.  I'll get my list corrected now and hope everyone else does too.  I appreciate  the correction!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to track this info down for months, but no one I know has been able to tell me how to insert a description of my character into the "examination" view.  When you examine another character, there is a box to the right of the icons of personal possessions are located where you can presumably add a colorful description of yourself.  I've seen it done by someone else (the description was horribly conceited and juvenile.)  How do I do this?  What is the name of the box?  Does my description of the problem make any sense?
<br><br>
Liniri, Half-HUMAN Paladin of Tunare.
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden in the depths of your online manual in the EQ folder are the directions for getting to your description box and entering your text.  Here's how to do it:  "To create your own description, press F9 to change to a view that you can see yourself, then inspect yourself by doubleclicking on you.  The description box is now open and you can click on it and start typing."  When you're done, the text in the box will be visible to anyone who inspects you.  It's important to remember that this description box is not a place for offensive material like swear words, etc. so do be careful what you choose to write there.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any way to get a text print out of the characters skills? 
<br><br>
Arzon
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know of any easy way to do this, but you can make a pen and paper list of your character's skills and update it or, as some people do, keep a list on whatever cute little gadget you have handy.  You could also screen shot your skills and then print it out for reference but I don't know of any utility in EQ that would allow you to directly make a text print out.


<br><br><br>
Thanks to you all for writing.  I am sorry I missed you last week but at least today I do have a chance to wish each of you a satisfying and interesting New Year.  I  hope the coming year brings happiness to you, in and out of Norrath.
