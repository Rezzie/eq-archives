    align="JUSTIFY"><big><big>T</big></big>hat next day in the commons Sphere came looking for
    the owner of the dagger and scroll. Sphere usually did not wear his armor when traveling
    inside the kingdom, but today it shined. I followed out of duty to my work. The normal
    pleasant folk were in the commons, and they stood aside of the armored Sphere. There stood
    Saturnino with his small band of men. Sphere approached within striking distance and
    spoke.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;You dare compare your small band of men and your meager home to
    my great towers by insulting my scholar's work?&quot;</font> </p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Saturnino said nothing, still angry from the comments about 'scantly
    clad women', and the silent retreat of the commoners from Sphere meant that Saturnino's
    following would not remain calm. Even the servants to Sphere stepped away. I stood my
    ground, paralyzed with fear of what might happen. Moments passed before one of the
    traveling rangers spoke up. He was a slender man, dressed in leathers and appeared to be
    moving between kingdoms. His name was Goral, and thus he spoke: </p>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Commoners, have you heard of any other towers like Master
    Sphere's? You seem to argue over his existence, when no one forces you to flock to his
    lands. If you seek a tower seek another. Alas Master Dach gave his title for a room in EQU
    Towers. Surely there are others?&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">One of Sphere's Captains spoke, the one named Marcus Yu. &quot;Why do
    you oppose EQU?&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Sphere then said: &quot;Yes tell me why you have such trouble with the
    Greatest Tower and its keeper?&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Saturnino stepped closer and said &quot;All right, then I shall build a
    tower greater than yours.&quot; He looked around for approval with that maverick grin
    &quot;heh heh heh&quot;, hoping for a fight. Sphere's face turned red with anger.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Sphere said: &quot;That is hopeless. Go ahead and try, you will fail.
    Join me instead. Bring your men and live in my towers, and work for me. I shall provide
    you and your whores shelter.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">I felt it time to speak up for my liege, and cast away my silence. I
    stood forward and as I moved to speak I could not help but fear I would be buried in the
    same mouse-brown robes I wore that day.</p>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Goral, do not let the voices you hear from others sway your mind
    before seeking your own opinion. Master Dach left his own tower to join us with the best
    interests of the people in mind. The voice of conflict rises from the opinions of only a
    few, not the whole gathering you see here.&quot; </td>
    <td valign="top" style="text-align: justify" width="34%"><font face="boldPS" size="3"><p
    align="JUSTIFY">Goral's reply was quick, and with it the commoners grew restless for
    conflict. &quot;My opinion has been formed from what I have heard from Sphere himself, not
    others. Sphere squelches any who speak against him with the fervor of a child, and lacks
    nobility in his efforts to calm those who object to his tower. My grievance with EQU is
    with Sphere himself.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Perhaps, Sphere, we should leave the commons before our names are
    slandered any more,&quot; I told Sphere, preparing to leave.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">Sphere took it a few steps further than I intended. &quot;Nah perhaps
    we should no longer support the commons! If we were to no longer come here, and no longer
    support the pleasant folk, surely the commerce would come to a halt.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">A man in robes spoke from the crowd. He struck me as another scribe or
    scholar, perhaps from a different school of thought than I. His name was Absor: &quot;That
    is not logical Sphere. If one seeks the shelter of your Towers they will come to the
    towers. The People who come here come here for other reasons, and certainly not to hear
    this babble.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">A Crowd was gathering and I felt that it was too late to escape.
    Several had come within arms reach to argue now, including The Noble WarDragon and the
    Vagabond called 'Bloodystumps'. Surely there would be a battle, for the majority of the
    capable warriors were here or nearby. I trembled in fear as many spoke at once in a
    festival of hate.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">WarDragon: &quot;Here is an idea Sphere. Leave the commons and then you
    can laugh all you want if the commerce comes to a stop. And since all of the commerce
    today revolved around you and your tower, you might have a point. Still, we would be
    better off without your persistence.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">BloodyStumps: &quot;Someone knock the chip off his shoulder! The
    commons has been active for a long time before the tower was built, and will remain that
    way! I need not the shelter of your tower when Lord McQuaid provides a similar tower, and
    many more guards.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Goral turned to address me again, and I flinched as people turned to
    face me instead of Sphere. &quot;I see no truth in insisting that Saturnino favors
    discussion of whores to discussions of politics. Such accusations and on-going lies are
    the reason I oppose EQU and Sphere. And this argument, did it not start from people
    growing tired of hearing about EQU? At every opportunity he beckons us to seek his tower?
    Your support in him is misguided, and he will only continue to embarrass you unless
    someone else takes the crown from his head. He is a child!&quot;</td>
    <td valign="top" style="text-align: justify" width="31%"><font face="boldPS" size="3"><p
    align="JUSTIFY">Sphere drew his blade: &quot;I am a child? Immature? Certainly a man who
    makes such an accusation is still seeking carnal knowledge and prefers to fondle himself
    when alone.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">My mouth moved but no sound came out. The cries of outrage turned to
    anger quickly and steel was drawn. The pleasant folk fled the commons, while the warriors
    raced to participate. I would have left were my legs obedient; nay I stood immobile. Cries
    ranged from &quot;That's indecent!&quot; to &quot;Words of experience, eh Sphere?&quot; A
    combat ensued.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Saturnino, Goral and other warriors and vagabonds joined in the fray.
    The guards of EQU defended Sphere carefully, watching each other in fear of being stabbed
    in the back. Dach found himself defending against men that once looked up to him, even if
    they attacked with reluctance. He used non-lethal combat to subdue the opponents of EQU,
    in hopes of later mending friendships. Other combat was brutal, inflicting wounds in those
    who might be called innocent. The combat ranged across the commons, from the pub to the
    watch tower. Soon I was caught up in the battle, forced to defend myself. Evening came,
    and despite the prowess of the opposition, Sphere's potency in combat proved to be
    greater. It was almost if the opposition was weak with disgust. All had sustained injuries
    when the banner of the Lord McQuaid was spotted in the commons. It was him!</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">McQuaid spoke the words of a wise man losing patience. &quot;I made
    arrangements to visit the Commons like of norm, and this is what I find here Sphere? A
    bloodbath in your name? All of you, cease this senseless conflict at once, and Sphere I
    will tolerate no more of you abusing those who come here.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Sphere mouthed the words &quot;me? abuse?&quot; without making sound as
    the Lord left the commons. Each party left for their own homes and keeps murmuring about
    the day's excitement, most nurturing wounds. Sphere left, but Dach, I and a few remained
    to talk.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">We spoke of Dach leaving his own Tower to join EQU, and those that
    today warred with him forgave him, urging him to take action against Sphere or to leave
    EQU. The conversation lasted for hours and was civilized. I quite enjoyed the change of
    pace. At the same time I grew ill from talk of leaving EQU and hints at a greater
    conflict. I slept not at all that night.</font></td>
