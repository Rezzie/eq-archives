I was disappointed to read that Absor mentioned us in his article about Guild
Names.  He effectively made a mockery of our guild name with obviously little or
no real information on us.  He is right, our guild made a name to attempt to
preserve our Tanarus name MOB... we struggled for a month to come up with a name
that would match it and the best we could come up with is Mystic Order of the
Brotherhood as he mentioned.  Now as you can see there is a redundancy in Order
and Brotherhood and thus we changed it to just the Mystical Order as is reflected
on our in game name and on our domain name mysticalorder.com (no real page there
right now).  Also, our charter was very well written and I didn't appreciate the
assumptions he made about it.  Our guild stands for honor and this editorial has
shaken things up in our guild resulting in the loss of a great member, XXXX, and
numerous different reactions.  I don't know exactly how to correct this problem,
but at least please forward this to Absor so he will understand what our guild
really is.  If you see a problem with The Mystical Order then by all means tell
me, but otherwise please don't mention us again, as it hurts my reputation as a
guild member and our guild as a whole.

<em><em>[Ed.  I obviously edited this letter.  I cut the name of the guild member out because I figured this letter was not written initially for publication, and I have no desire to make this issue any more controversial than it already has been.
<br><br>
My only problem this guild is its name. Anything else that I might have implied was an error. My apologies for that. I knew nothing of this guild in its current form, and therefore had nothing to judge them by but its name.  I hope if all of this has proven even one thing;  that the name people chose to use on line and in EverQuest, be they characters or guilds, has a great power to affect how they are viewed.
<br><br>
I'm not sorry that I wrote that editorial.  And I will write more in the future.  I will offend people.  I don't like offending people, but I will write what I feel is true.  And I will call for change when I see that it is needed.</em></em>

Kinrog is our leader but he said you can use my e-mail since it summed it up well.  Btw our guild name is the Mystical Order in game and out...  Brotherhood was dropped because we have females in our guild, the awkwardness of the name, and just the length of it is a bit much too (www.mysticalorderofthebrotherhood.com... hehe).
<br><br>
<em>His letter was longer, but I left the rest out for the sake of those that it mentions and because he talked of guild matters that I don't think need to be posted here.  Whatever the reason, I am glad to hear that this guild has changed its name.  I guess I can accept the name The Mystical Order (though the question Mystical Order of </em>What?<em> comes to mind)...
<br><br>
I also received a fairly large amount of mail regarding that editorial.  I decided not to print any of them.  Not because some told me I was wrong.  Hehe, lots of folks thought that.  Most told me that neither I nor RedEye should have the right to tell them how to name themselves, or that my decisions of which names were wrong was... wrong.  Even those that agreed with me, and there were a fair number of them, sometimes thought that I was wrong with some of my choices.  Fair enough.  But there were just too many to print.  I decided to take the easy way out and apologize to all of you for not printing them, rather than trying to choose which ones were best representatives of the group.  Thanks for the letters.  Nothing here on EQX would happen without them.</em>

Greetings...again*grins*,

Another excellent issue, EQX!

Amongst the many great stories and articles, one did jump out at me that I had to mention: <a href="../Issue58/expressions.htm">Expression</a>.  In particular this line rang very true, and I hope everyone takes note of this: 
<br><br>
"Don't let game mechanics stand in the way of playing the role that you want." 
<br><br>
This phrase is the type of thinking is one of the important elements that makes a role-playing game the *best* and most *creative* it can be. Imagine a "character" you have always wanted to play and "flesh" him/her out within the contest of the world he/she is inhabiting. Challenge your own creativity, have fun doing something unique.

Just to let you know, that article Oghma did about <a href="../Issue58/evilgood.htm">role-playing evil</a> was very well done.  It actually re-awakened my interest in playing a Dark Elf.

Hi 
<br><br>
Just wanted to let you know I found that <a href="../Issue58/step.htm">article</a> to be excellent, very well written, and made me think of my own step-father. 
<br><br>
I have not read this mag in a while after losing some interest in EQ, but I want to let you guys know I am very proud of your work and am happy to see all this come such a long way.

Thanks Mike! 
<br><br>
Im glad to see you found your way back to EverQuest Express. I hope we continue to add joy to your life with our writings.. It's why we write :) 
<br><br>
I understand the lack of enthusiasm with EQ. Anytime you see lots of changes (good and bad) in a game it can get a bit frustrating.  I understand. I just hope we see you in the final! It's going to be a fantastic game. 
<br><br>
I'm glad you enjoyed the article :)
