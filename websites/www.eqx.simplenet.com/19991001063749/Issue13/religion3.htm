	<big><big>W</big></big>ith all this to choose from, you should be able to identify your deity and come up with a code of behavior.  A sort of "Ten Commandments" that should guide your characters actions.  You then need to try to play these commandments and try to stop others form violating them.  Your deity’s demeanor will decide how you go about stopping others.  A forthright god will be along the lines of "Halt sinners! Forgo thy sins!"  A Drow god would probably have you stab them in the back.

As far as creating a ritual goes… don’t get too crazy.  Some simple acknowledgment is usually good.  Doing odd sacrifices can really get goofy-looking or offensive.  You can have a lot of fun doing the corpse collection thing, or emoting some esoteric ritual, but don’t do something like [[Blank F***s the corpse of Orc in the a**]].

Oaths are another way of coloring an rpg world.  "By the mighty Axe of Durin!", "I swear on the brass B***s of Odin".  Any character can and should use exclamations to give emphasis and describe feelings.

The religious system, like the world history, is what builds our perception of a gaming world.  Robert E. Howard’’s grim Cimmerian gods give quite a different "feel" than the graceful Valar of Tolkien, or the quarrelsome, lusty, Greek gods.  This tapestry of belief gives us our common framework of understanding, a reference point to give us the desire to fight the gods or overcome defeat.  I hope EQ’s system allows for many different methods of religious or non-religious expression, to create a vibrant society,
