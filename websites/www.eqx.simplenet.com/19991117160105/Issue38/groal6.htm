Groal awoke to find himself lying on a worn and dirty mattress. A hush of subdued yet insistent voices filtered through his still aching brain but the agony he had felt before had settled down to a dull throb. He sat up and looked about his surroundings. In the dim light of a single large candle he saw a group of ogres sitting around a large table, deep in a heated argument. He sat silently and listened.
<br><br>
"It's time, I tell you. We have waited long enough. With Kinlack and Barbergan dead Thrack will move quickly. We must take action now or never."
<br><br>
"No. It's too early. We have yet to acquire the forces or broad support we will need. If we strike too soon, all will be lost."
<br><br>
" I agree with Natog. We must get the support of the new Captain. Ogra's mysterious death must be the work of Thrack but he has appointed a new Captain who is not as sympathetic to him as he thinks. Baltor's nephew is one of the 'disappeared', though Thrack doesn't know this. Still, Baltor may not want to jeopardize his new position. Natog needs time to find where his loyalties lie."
<br><br>
"Bah! You are as timid as you are old, Agkor. We know we can count on nearly half the guard to support us."
<br><br>
"Our support comes from the lower echelons, Dalgra",  Natog said. "How much help will they truly be? Will their men follow them if the high officers contest us?"
<br><br>
"If we wait now, Bashra, Thrack will tighten his grip on the city. He has already sent news of Kinlack's death to Grobb. An army of trolls will be here within days, maybe as early as tomorrow. What then? Do we wait until he has declared himself King? Do we wait for Grobb to occupy Oggok?"
<br><br>
A silence fell over the conspirators. Dalgra tapped her fingers on the table in a rhythm that reflected her frustration. Groal spoke into the quiet.
<br><br>
"Is there anything to eat or drink?"
<br><br>
A chair scraped along the wood floor as Bashra rose to hand a skin of water to the little ogre. He drank in great noisy gulps, not stopping until he had drained it dry. Natog handed him a large piece of dried meat. Groal sat there with his mouth full, chewing mightily at the tough but delicious chunk of black meat.
<br><br>
"This is really good", he said at last to the group watching him in silence. "What is it?"
<br><br>
"Jerked Dwarf", Agkor said from the table. "You've never eaten Dwarf? Who are you, anyway? Dalgra says you will be of help if we can convince you of the need but I don't see how one ogluk could make any difference."
<br><br>
"I already told you. He killed Kinlack and nearly a dozen troll warriors single handed. Don't let his stature fool you, Agkor. He could make all the difference."
<br><br>
"I also killed Ogra. And if Barbergan's dead, I guess I killed him too."
<br><br>
"No." said Dalgra. "Barbergan awoke this morning calling for water. Thrack insisted on giving it to his 'old friend' and Barbergan died a few minutes later. Bashra was there and told us. Come sit here with us, Groal. We have much to tell you. I'll think you'll change your mind about helping us when you hear what we have to say."
<br><br>
For the next hour Groal sat and listened as Dalgra and an old wizened ogre who introduced himself as Agkor, Master of the Merchant's Guild, told him an abbreviated history of the ogre race since the death of the last great King. He learned how the Council and the Clan Elders and especially Thrack and Barbergan's grandfathers had reduced the ogres from a mighty and proud people to a state of beastliness. How those two had consolidated their power with pogroms and the wholesale slaughter of any that dared question their authority. How their sons had continued the caste system set up by them and how it had deepened it's hold on Oggok under Thrack and Barbergan's leadership. The few who were still educated and privileged mostly had no interest in changing the new order but some were discontent and as the trolls began to sway the Council for their own uses they had formed a clique of  soldiers, merchants and students to oppose them. They had been planning for years to bring down the Council and this was the situation in which Groal now found himself. He looked into the earnest faces and made a decision.
<br><br>
"I'll help," he said simply. "And we have a powerful ally outside the city. Jarel, The Dark Elf Shadow Knight, will lend himself and his great powers to this cause." A shadow moved in one corner and a tall, powerfully built ogre in officer's dress stood. He had not spoken during the entire time and Groal was not prepared for the deep growling that proceeded from the mouth twisted with the scars of battle.
<br><br>
"Jarel is dead," he said. He scowled at the young stranger and placed a huge fist around the hilt of the largest broadsword Groal had ever seen. He doubted he himself would have the strength to even lift it, much less wield it in battle.
<br><br>
"Dalgra has told us of this claim of yours," said Agkor. "That you were raised in the dark woods of Feerrott by the author of 'The Battle on the Plains' and that you claim to be the same Groal who perished with his family on Grumthor's estates a dozen years ago. I admit you bear a strong resemblance to my old employer but the tale you tell is too fantastic. Do you have proof?"
<br><br>
"I know who you are," Groal said. "You were my father's business manager."
<br><br>
"This is not unknown."
<br><br>
"Is it known that once a caravan was lost to bandits in the deserts of South Ro and you managed to recover the losses by making a deal with a rival band? That you thought Grumthor was not aware of this?"
<br><br>
Agkor looked at Groal in amazement. "How…..how could you know of this? I never told anyone. It has long been forbidden to deal with humans."
<br><br>
"I read Grumthor's diary. Jarel and I found it in the ruins of the castle. That is how I came to be here now."
<br><br>
"I should have known I couldn't keep anything secret from Grumthor. Well, this much at least I believe, that you are truly his son. You must tell me more when we have the time. If we survive." 
<br><br>
"If you were truly trained under Jarel's tutelage, then you must have an opinion about whether we should strike now or continue waiting. Tell us your thoughts, little ogluk." The monstrous soldier sounded skeptical as he looked down disapprovingly at Groal.
<br><br>
"Now, of course. There's no question. Jarel has written: 'The assassin strikes when his enemy is in disarray. When the leaders contend or new leaders arise," he quoted.
<br><br>
" 'Before there is agreement and all is in flux, the assassin takes his opportunity'," the soldier finished the quote. "You know Jarel's works but this is not convincing that he still lives."
<br><br>
"Kraal, it doesn't matter. Whether it's true or not we must hit the council now. Can we agree on this?" Dalgra looked at each worried face in turn. One by one, they reluctantly nodded in assent.
<br><br>
The next half hour was spent reviewing their plans and except for a few slight changes, Groal expressed his approval. The cell of revolutionaries was suitably impressed by Groal's insights and their confidence in success replaced any hesitancies still harbored by the more reluctant of the group. They would make their move tonight. Bashra and Kraal left to gather the soldiers loyal to their cause and old Agkor left to inform his friends in the Merchant's Guild. Natog departed for the College where the students would be organized to help where they could. The wheels were in motion and now there was only success or death. Dalgra stayed behind with Groal.
<br><br>
"How long before the evening meal is served to the palace guard?"
<br><br>
"In an hour or so. Why?"
<br><br>
"Can you get this", he gave her a small vial wrapped in leather, "introduced into the water they are served?"
<br><br>
She took it from him. "I think so. Why? What is it?"
<br><br>
"A potion that will render them senseless. It should help if we are to assault the Council chambers in Kilgor's castle."
<br><br>
"I'll have to go now, then. Wait here. The guard are still tearing the city apart searching for you." She stood and walked over to the door. Before she opened it she came back to Groal and bit him on his cheek. Groal nearly fainted from ecstasy. She gave him a  smile as she shut the door behind her. He wondered where Jarel was and what he was doing.
<br><br>
At the edge of the Feerrott, Jarel lay snoring. The watch for nightfall had proved too taxing for the old elf and he had fallen asleep. In his youth, it was not unusual for Jarel to remain awake as long as ten days, fighting or spying. But he was no longer young and had not been for many decades. The casting of Scorbad's Scry had taken more out of him than he would have ever imagined and he had not been aware of the fatigue that had overcome him. A slight noise in the forest brought him to his feet before he had even woke, his sword singing from it's scabbard and flying in a deadly circle around him. He opened his eyes, slightly confused, it taking a few seconds to get his bearings. Myrlor stood before him, a sly grin on her face.
<br><br>
"You're too old for this, Shadow Knight", said the young and beautiful wood elf. Her lilting soprano reminded him of Sarehlyn, his first wife and the only thing before Groal he had ever loved. He had always blamed himself for her death at the hands of the Qeynos guards who had scoured the Karanas in search of him. He shook his head to remove the bitter memories.
<br><br>
"What do you want? Go away. I haven't time for your tormenting just now. If you care for Groal, you'll leave me be or else endanger him further."
<br><br>
"Me? Endanger him? You old foolish elf. I am here to save him. Look into the shadows around you."
<br><br>
Jarel turned then and saw shining from every bush and high in the trees hundreds and hundreds of small eyes reflecting the cool light of the half moon glowing low in the early evening sky. In a soughing of leaves the animals came out from their hiding, some coming up to Jarel to sniff or lick at his boots. He recognized many as animals he had brought back from sure death. He looked down upon the strange creature whom he had always considered his curse. She spoke.
<br><br>
"The little ones can't help much but Corvorants, Bears and Listcats are here also. And that old lion you and Groal pulled from the grotto last year is here with his pride of seven. What do you think of my army, Jarel?" She laughed quietly at the astonished look on his face. "No killing for you, Shadow Knight. You have worked too long and too hard. To anger now the gods you have sworn to serve would be a tragedy even you don't deserve."
<br><br>
"Damn your gods. I will not stand by while Groal is in danger."
<br><br>
"A noble sentiment to justify the evil you plan in your heart. No, Jarel. It is my duty to guide you and protect you. I will not fail."
<br><br>
"Guide me? Protect me? You have never been anything but a stone in my boot, a thorn in my side, a…a….". Words failed him as he tried to express his disdain for the audacity of the supernatural being's statement.
<br><br>
"Jarel, Jarel", she said kindly. "How do you think it is that you always found those creatures in need of your services? You have no skills as a Ranger. No, Jarel. It was I who led you to them. Or them to you. Either way, you would not have completed your penitence without me. I won't see you throw away all my hard work. If you go into Oggok, slaughtering ogres, all the good you have done will be for naught. Don't you see, Shadow Knight? The time has come for you to collect your reward and find the peace you have sought and earned."
<br><br>
"I can't let Groal do this thing on his own. He will surely die. My life and my fate do not matter to me, Groal's does."
<br><br>
She laughed heartily. "Your life? Have you lost your elvish sight as well as your wits? Look over here Jarel. Tell me what you see." She walked a little ways off and halted, pointing down at her feet. Jarel came over to see what she wanted to show him. There, lying on the ground, was himself, a grey pallor on his face. His mouth was suddenly dry. He looked up and into Myrlor's eyes.
<br><br>
"Yes, Shadow Knight, Bane of West Karana. Your last act on Norrath was the casting of the Scry. It is time to go, Shadow Knight. Don't worry about Groal. The gods have plans for him that do not include an early demise. The beasts of Feerrott will do their part when the time comes." She turned away and walked slowly into the forest. Jarel took one last look at his material self and followed. A faint light grew around them, obliterating the green of the forest. Jarel found himself walking into light, through the light, until all there was of the world was light. He was not blinded as he should have been and in the distance he made out faint figures he somehow knew were waiting for him. Sarehlyn too, he knew, was waiting. The Mother of All had at last forgiven him his great crimes. The years slipped away from him like a snake sheds it's skin and it was as a young elf he entered paradise.
