It came down to a final hand, both warriors sweating and looking at the other, and
then their hands, then each other again. The betting was high, very high indeed. It
had boiled down to a battle of egos, who would win the others wages, who would remain
the better man. The sun was setting on the valley, and the ale was running low.

"So," Emerson grumbled, "are you going to put out or get out?" he snarled, waiting
for Goareke to make his bet. The other warrior slowly pushed forward the money that
he had remaining and demanded he call the hand. All laid down cards and silence fell
on the table.

The apothecary had the winning hand. Both warriors cursed and threw their cards, and
left in disgust, each looking like they might attack the other once out of the
tavern. The apothecary started to chuckle, and slid a fair amount of the money into a
pouch, which was left on the table. As he gathered up and stood to leave, he looked
to Kip and smiled.
<br><br>
"Forty percent, right?" Kip verified, taking the pouch casually. The apothecary
donned his cloak and nodded. "See you in two weeks," the halfling grinned.
