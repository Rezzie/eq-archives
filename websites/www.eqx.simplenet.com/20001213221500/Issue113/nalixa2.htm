<br><br>
I felt I should withdraw myself to Qeynos to await an answer from the Council.  I went to seek out Selyton but he must have left the camp again.  I thanked Cros for his assistance in rescuing me from the depths of the Burrow.  He merely looked at me with an odd expression and told me with a nod of the head, "You are welcome child".  I have had enough of these people for a time.  How dare he!  If it weren't for my mission I would have explained to him, at great length, my position and standing in Erudin.  I almost started a sharp retort of that nature in Elder Dragon, but then felt why bother?  It feels good to be back behind secure walls and to see alert guards going about their watch changes.  I sat for a time near the Temple of Life gazing at the structure's wonder.  The very air near the temple seems to sing of life's purity.  After my trials in Black Burrow and the rank air, I felt just being near the priests of the Prime Healer cleansing those foul smells from my mind.  I took the same room before as the innkeeper remembered me and knew it had been to my liking.  I have never in my life been so thankful to Prexus for his gifts as when I finally got to take my first bath since I entered the Burrow.
<br><br>

<br><br>
I woke this morning to find a letter awaiting me at the desk.  It would seem that my partner during the Karana festival was not as insincere as I thought.  It seems he observed my return to Qeynos, but saw that I had entered the Temple of Life's gates and did not wish to disturb me.  He invites me this evening for feasting and celebration with some of his fellows.  I am not sure what the celebration is for, but being able to enjoy some society sounds delicious.  I wonder if I should send a runner to the Glade, thanking Selyton for his efforts on my behalf?  I hesitate however, surely if he had wished to speak with me he would have not kept away.
<br><br>
November 9, 3178
<br><br>
Janien was a dream.  When I went down stairs to meet him, he looked truly dashing, while my own person looked under dressed.  His silk and finery made me feel plain, but I had not anticipated bringing anything with me for such occasions.  Janien swept an elegant bow as I entered the foyer.  I told him I did not think I had anything appropriate for the occasion and was sorry that I had troubled him but would not be able to accompany him to the party.
<br><br>
He would not hear of it and took my hand immediately, leading me to a lady's shop to buy a satin dress of midnight blue.  I could not help but to giggle as I twirled around the lady's shop, only stopping to look in the glass at myself once more while wearing a satin dress of midnight blue.  Behind me Janien announced with a laughing voice he would take the dress and hoped the lady would come with it.  I tried to argue his purchasing the dress but he would not hear of it.  
<br><br>
His fellows were lively and well spoken and I have not had such pleasurable acquaintances since Erudin.  Indeed I had no idea our cousins could be so agreeable.  I do believe I may have drunk a little too much or so my head tells me.  Perhaps I danced a little to much as my feet are telling me, but I did not get enough of Janien's attentions.  He never once left my side during the course of the evening.  He played the perfect host of introducing me to his friends.  His friend Beljarn was throwing a party at his "in town home" near the Ironforge estate and though the residence of that great estate where not in attendance, Commander Kane Bayle was.
<br><br>
It would seem that he and Janien are old friends for as soon as we entered Commander Bayle strode up to him and demanded to know where Janien had been hiding me.  He informed Janien, upon the latter's protests, it had to be so he could win my affections before he himself had a chance.  I could not help, after the short introductions, to feel as if Commander Bayle was someone I met before.  My mind kept tugging at something but I could not really place it.  I told him as much and he assured me that had we have met, he would have certainly remembered the pleasure.
<br><br>
During the course of the evening I mentioned more than once to Janien I was almost sure I had met Commander Bayle before.  He would laugh and pull me out for another dance stating no man in his right mind could be mistaken on that account.  Janien expressed his wish to take me boating on his skiff.  Even though the inn is near the sea, the idea of being able to lean back and trail my hands in the water was too much to resist.  He has to be out of town tomorrow on business but will return the following day.  I begin to almost hope that the Erudin Council does not move swiftly on my report.  The thought of having to return to Erudin let alone travel once again begins not to be such an appealing thought.
<br><br>
November 10, 3178
<br><br>
The weather has turned miserable.  Karana seems to refuse to believe that October's stormy weather should be over by now.  I had considered taking a walk on the battlements, but not in this down pour.  I think I shall curl up with some translations for the day.  I wonder if Selyton is out in this rain right now?  I can almost see his hair plastered to his head, oblivious to the fact that his clothes are soaked, his brow furrowed as he stares at the ground looking for whatever he is looking for.  That is one man that truly nothing seems to phase him and being drenched like that would look perfectly natural for his person.  I cannot help but to amuse myself what he would have looked like at Janien's friend's party, perhaps the only element that he regardless of dress would look very out of place.  I should contact a runner tomorrow to take a note to Surefall Glade.  If there was any anger at my escapade surely by now it has receded.
<br><br>
November 11, 3178
<br><br>
I woke early this morning before sunrise in hopes of catching a runner without a current commission.  Considering the recent Black Burrow Gnolls activities this proved hard than I thought.  I was informed that all runners were out with injuries or currently assigned but to try back tomorrow.  I amused myself in town for a bit shopping for lunch.  The sky was clear and could not help thinking a picnic was in order for Janien's outing with me.  Near mid morning I returned to my inn, only to enter the main door and find Selyton waiting for me.
<br><br>
I nearly dropped my things as that stern gaze turned on me.  He merely looked at me, glanced over my packages containing enough food for five people, and raised an eyebrow.  I told him it was good to see him again and would meet him in the tavern shortly after putting my purchases in my room.  Again he said nothing just nodded his head and strode off.  I entered the tavern to find him seated in a corner and joined him stating that just this morning I had been seeking a runner to look for him.  Selyton looked very tired, as if he had not seen anything remotely comfortable for a few days.  The splash of mud on his clothes was a confirmation to me that he had indeed been out in yesterday's storm.  I could not stop myself before a laugh escaped me and suddenly he clapped his hand over mine.  The sting of the action did not hurt so much as it startled me.
<br><br>
He then spoke to me in a voice almost as rough as when he would speak of the gnolls.  His eyes glared the whole while.  He accused, more than asked, what sort of games did I think I was playing?  I told him I had sought him out on several occasions to speak with him, but he was never present.  He in return asked if I thought that such an incursion to Black Burrow could happen and the gnolls would just sit back and say go right ahead.  I asked him to speak plainer which he was more than happy to.  He told me of the gnolls swarming out of the burrow, that Surefall has been over taxed in trying to hold them back.  Reinforcements from Qeynos arrived only just in time otherwise the entrance to the Glade might have been comprised.  He then said through clenched teeth he was sorry he had missed the party.  The look of disgust on his face being directed towards me, the fact that this man had taken me into such a place, found us safety, found us food, and then had brought help to find me overcame my senses.
<br><br>
All the horror of that place came rushing back and the drums began to ring in my ears again.  The tears that followed I could not stop as I repeated over and over that I had tried to talk to him after, had looked and hunted for him in the camp.  That none of his fellows would answer my inquiries after him and most would not even speak to me.  I hadn't realized his hand instead of gripping mine painfully had turned to a soothing stroke until I heard a voice behind me.  Janien was striding up to the table.  I raised my head to look at him and he stopped looking at me for a moment.  My face must have been a mess from the tears.  Janien's expression darkened as he looked at me then to Selyton holding my hand.  Everything seemed to happen at once.  Selyton was on his feet and Janien charging him before I could even begin thinking of explaining or an introduction.  The watch came in and pulled them both apart.  I went down to see them both in the hold below the arena and the Captain won't allow me in today.  I wonder why Selyton jumped to attack Janien almost fast as Janien him?  I could understand Janien's action.  Obviously he thought this stranger had upset me and to teach him a lesson, but Selyton's action was before Janien had even moved.
<br><br>
November 12, 3178
<br><br>
I have just returned from the hold in a confused state.  The guards would only give me thirty minutes with Selyton but they could have only allowed me five and the outcome would not have changed.  He wouldn't speak to me at all.  Janien seems to have been released earlier this morning, perhaps his friendship with Commander Bayle served him here.  I returned to my inn to find that Janien had stopped by looking for me and said he would return later.  There are things occurring that make me feel like a fish swimming against one of Prexus' riptides.  I believe my time waiting to hear from the Council has been spent ill.  I shall seek out Cros and get some answers.
<br><br>
November 12, 3178, Post Script
<br><br>
I am honestly surprised by how well my conversation went with Cros.  He was tending some wounded in Surefall when I approached and told him I wished to speak with him.  I then expressed my shame that I had not been here to help.  My ignorance in not knowing that gnolls would attack could not ease the fact that it seems I had abandoned them after their help, but hopefully it would absolve the thought that my absence was due to being ungrateful or cowardly.  Cros asked if Selyton found me since he seemed most anxious to do so.  That he even set off for Qeynos refusing any binding on his wounds taken in battle.  Cros then spoke to me kindly and said that Selyton was sometimes foolish in the quickness of his actions.  Cros went on to say that Selyton when not thinking completely with his head he was usually sobered by having to go into Qeynos for any length of time.  I must have stood staring at Cros like a fool for a good five minutes.  I told him he was mistaken, that Selyton did find me but accused me of things that although there was negligence on my part, it wasn't with evil intent.  That during this discussion he had gotten into a row and was currently in the lock up.  Being from Erudin I really have no power nor contacts to negotiate his release, nor would he tell me what I needed to do or whom to contact.  He refused to speak or even look at me.  Cros said he would come in the morning, that Selyton should know better and him cooling his heels would not hurt him one bit.  I then thanked Cros again for him coming to my aid in the Burrow.
<br><br>
He smiled at me and said that actually it was surprisingly easy.  There was little resistance except outside the chamber I was being held.  Considering Selyton's report on the activity from when we had been inside together he had expected an almost impossible time reaching me.  However, the gnolls were almost non-existent down into the chamber I was in.  A shadow crossed his face as he stated that it was in my favor the gnolls seemed so oddly unwatchful.  His healing spell sweeping through me was almost a breath too late.
<br><br>
The slow walk back to Qeynos did not provide me any answers to Cros' words.  Why on Norrath would the gnolls have all been absent from their heavily guarded posts leading into the heart of the Burrow?
<br><br>
November 13, 3178
<br><br>
I waited for Cros at the hold this morning.  Selyton was released and walked right past me and out of the arena.  Cros looked at me, then at Selyton's back and followed.  I could tell they were having a heated discussion.  Finally Selyton came back and said for me to follow him.  He took me out into the hills and sat back on his haunches.
<br><br>
I began to explain again that I had wanted to talk to him after the Burrow, but he always seemed to move away.  I thought it was best I left since he seemed to want to have nothing further to do with me.  I honestly didn't know that the gnolls would react this way, though that's not an excuse for me not fighting by the side of the ones who saved me.  It was merely an explanation of my actions.
<br><br>
As if I hadn't said any of this he asked me how long I have been liking to associate with scum such as Janien.  This question took me back and I am sure my face must have showed it for his expression almost softened.  I recounted our first meeting and later the others.  Selyton then astounded me with an apology.  He told me that he had encountered him before and though lacking proof, thinks he might serve the Plague Bringer.  He would not explain the reason for this assumption, just merely asked me to trust him on this as he has trusted me not to impart my reasons for going into the Burrow in the first place.  The man is difficult to argue with.  Selyton also stated that Cros had told him of my interest in a particular gnoll I had seen in the Burrow.  One that was not native to this area.  There seemed no question from his silence following this statement if I was going to seek them out.  He sat looking at me and finally I broke the stillness by saying that I should have made up my mind if I am in a few days.  He still said nothing, just looked at me with that unreadable expression.  I then asked him if he would like to accompany me should I do so.  He smiled at me.
<br><br>
To look at his face you would think it has been carved from stone, but when he smiled at me I suddenly felt like I was on the deck of a swift cutter racing the wind across the ocean.  Never have I met a man that so often left me at a lack of words.  I just sat looking at his smiling face unable to come up with something to say.  Selyton then asked me to leave the inn and come to Surefall while I thought things over.  It will be difficult to watch the boats from there but I think I can find an excuse to get into town tomorrow.
<br><br>
November 14, 3178
<br><br>
I met the first boat coming in and received a letter, the letter I have been so impatient for.  The brown leather wrapped note contained instructions to proceed in my research.  I was also instructed to merely observe and make no further contact in case I alert the gnolls that they were being watched.  Did the High Council actually read my first report?  How am I to know what is occurring if I merely sit on a hill and look from afar.
<br><br>
November 16, 3178
<br><br>
Selyton and I have left the Qeynos Hills and the land has dramatically changed.  The hills have given away to flat plains with tuffs of grass that the wind dances through.  I constantly think of what I have just left and wonder if it was a mistake.  
<br><br>
After returning to Surefall, I told Selyton I felt that this matter needed further investigation and I was intending to set about it.  He amazed me yet again.  I turned to head to my bag with the intention of seeking out some shopkeepers for supplies.  Selyton slipped his hand into mine and with those strong palms he gently stopped me from that task.  The rest of the evening we strolled through his glade.  He once again pointed out natural points of beauty.  He showed me views that otherwise I would have missed. The wonders that nature could create with formations of natural growth by herself.  The whole evening, sunlight splashed across my face in warm fleeting touches through the leaves.  The sounds of water singing, whispers of a crackle from the trees, and Selyton's silent presence next to me made me feel as if I have almost missed half my life.  We sat on an outcropping near the waterfall to watch the sunset through a break in the trees turning the world for a moment a golden red.  It was almost as if the Glade was saying good bye to me and She turned out in Her finest gowns for the occasion.
<br><br>
Something inside me tells me that was a time never to be touched again as I now sit upon this plane with it's earth hardened from years of exposure.  It is no wonder there are tales of ghosts walking this vast expanse with its sheer enormity.  As far as my eye can see there is almost flat land with nothing to stop the wind's bellowing.  Selyton's odd behavior this evening has done nothing to keep me from not believing in local folklore.  He has been acting strangely ever since we set up camp.  He keeps cocking his head to the side as if he hears more than just the breeze.  A couple of times he has paced the edges of our camp only stopping to cock his head to the side once more. 
<br><br>
November 17, 3178
<br><br>
SHE made their travel faster, not that that helped me at all.  My legs felt like they were made from water.  I had no idea I could run so far for so long and not collapse.  I continually wonder if Selyton realized he wouldn't be out here unless I had wanted or asked him to come.  If he wishes to run off with some old druid friend of his I have no problem with that.  But if so let me go my OWN way not continually make me catch up as SHE and he dash ahead.  I kick myself when I think of saying to him "let's keep near the guard towers on the path".  Had we gone around and off the road perhaps we wouldn't have run into HER.
<br><br>
It was near the last outpost that a wolf came dashing right for me, leaping on its hind legs to gather to launch at my head.  Selyton jumped between us, taking the impact and being knocked backwards on to the dirt.  He was chuckling as it licked his face.  I merely stood with my hands on my hips staring down at his antics in the dirt.  He was rolling back and forth with this wolf, then with a woman who was licking his cheek.  He rolled over once more and must have remembered me standing there, for he untangled himself from her.  She shot me a wicked look as he did so and stood up.  She did not address me, just merely asked Selyton where he had found THE person over there.  The gesture in my direction was not a complimentary one.  Selyton explained that we were looking into some gnoll "matters".  She frowned at me and said to Selyton he should know better than to take a "City" GIRL out to her death.  At this point I had had enough and turned heading the direction Selyton had originally pointed out.  The derogatory remarks that continued towards my person met my back as I headed off.
<br><br>
I had just crossed a rise when Selyton passed me.  Shooting a smile back in my direction as he did so with the same wolf running circles around his legs he shouted something over his shoulder while pointing my direction.  Almost without missing one of his speedy strides he headed off.  The wolf stopped, looked at me.  With a wicked long toothed grin across her furry face she turned around and flicked her tail charging after Selyton.  Bewildered I stood for a moment wondering where THEY were going in the direction I needed to so fast.  
<br><br>
Then some leaves fell off of one of the few trees out here that was near me.  I stood looking at it for a moment wondering at this strange occurrence.  One leaf, maybe two falling at once I could understand but half the tree?  Then I felt it.  The jolt rocked up into my hipbones and slowly I turned around.  Behind me, crossing the plane, was the largest figure I had ever beheld.  Its body dwarfed the guard towers and its weapon could have smashed them into bits.  This giant was also beginning to bear down on me.  My mind was frozen in fear and then like a rabbit, in flight.  
<br><br>
The giant must have chased me half way across the plains.  Each time I thought I could run no further my legs kept moving.  Perhaps it was its voice, or more likely its smell.  But the thought of its hands encompassing me like a miniature toy kept me running across the plains like someone chased by Cazic Thule himself.  Dark soon fell, and even though it seemed like the giant had given up the chase I still ran on.  Finally I could hold myself up no longer and collapsed on the ground.  I still remember how the cool night air hurt my lungs as I gasped for breath.
<br><br>
I must have slept for a bit for the next thing I knew was a man's voice calling out.  Suddenly there was light from torches around me as the guards took me in.   The Captain himself laid his cloak upon the tiled floor for me to rest upon.  They were very hospitable and inquired if I had received any further hurts.  When I responded my only hurt was exhaustion from running for my life, the Captain summoned a paladin who laid his cool fingers on my temples taking the aches from my body.  He assured me that my person was now safe and that any evil seeking me out would be through their blades.  The paladin then showed me to the upper floor and spreading out the Captain's cloak again for a bed and his own for a cover and bade me to get some sleep.
<br><br>
The Captain came into the upper hall to check on me and lay before me a feast.  I could tell it was some of the men's rations and scraped up seasoning.  I could have eaten rocks I think.  They were so obviously trying to serve me a fine table after my adventures I ate it happily and told the Captain that it was some of the finest I had tasted in awhile.  The Captain obviously pleased with my praise, told me to fear not, the only sound of feet I will hear tonight would be his own person checking my safety.
<br><br>
Civilization for me, even out here.  
<br><br>
November 18, 3178
<br><br>
It felt so good.  Rarely have I had such pleasure.  Honestly I didn't want it to stop.
<br><br>
This morning I awoke to a dreary day.   The Captain was in the upper hall within moments of my stirring asking how I had slept.  I assured him the meal from the night before, his generosity in his cloak, and his nearness in my protection had me sleeping as if I were back in the palace in Erudin.  The Captain beamed at me.  I assume this epitome of chivalrous talents has few to appreciate his skill out here and it is a pleasure for him to have a recipient who can commend him.  He informed me I had a visitor, but he was perfectly prepared to send his "scruffy neck" packing should I so command.  I merely asked for a few moments for my morning toilette and I would receive the "scruffy neck".
<br><br>
Selyton walked in.  I examined the curtains that hung from the large window.  Selyton spoke of his fear for my life once he had heard the giant and realized it was hunting the someone not with them, me.  I gazed at the twelve foot window saying out loud how talented the craftsman must have been.  Selyton told me he had thought Jenaira would have granted me speed since they had already spotted the giant.  I remarked on how it could be possible that these soldiers managed to keep the white tiles amongst the black ones and the dirt so clean.  Selyton asked if I was listening to him.  I gestured towards him and the grand staircase.  He then said that he and Jenaira had known each other from along ago and he had hoped they were still friends.  She had been his first true, I assume love - he stopped here and never said.  I stated that one should hope he doesn't allow any old wolf woman to lick him all over his upper body, and by the way had he tried the Ration Dijon they served here?  He then slapped his hand against the wall and strongly, more like half shouted, my name.
<br><br>
Here I was in my element.  I can still feel the chill down to my feet as I turned and looked upon his dusty person and bred to my bones, drew myself up like the Erudite I am.  I slowly approached him with a slight smile.  And slapped him as hard as I could dragging my nails down his cheek as I did so.  I coldly informed him, that if he and his Bitch could keep giants from running after them and killing those who did not find such things frivolous child's play amusing, I and my life would appreciate it.  Furthermore, the next time he'd think to abuse my person, either like in the bar or by shouting, he would meet me full force.  I would not be some plaything dancing, like him, upon the planes at high speed without a willy care for others.  If he wished to chase the wind like a child with a person who's more-than-a-friend-but-not and to leave their companions to die, he was more than welcome.  Just tell the Captain of Guards so he can call in the local farmers before he does so.  Selyton, looked at me after this statement as if I were there a goddess of wrath or a ghost to haunt him.
<br><br>
I can still hear the echoing whispers of my name down the stairwell as I descended from the room above.  I barely heard words about a female that was worse than a crag spider bite and being free of it.  The Captain looked briefly at the floor above his head as I came into view on the sweeping staircase.  He offered his hand to help me down the last of the steps, which I welcomed.  The Captain looked at me with a questioning expression as my slipper touched the floor, his hand moving close to his sword.  I merely exited the under the vast tower arch with the briefest motion of nay from my hand.
<br><br>
Planes, Gnolls, and Death, it is you and I now.  The Captain has told me of your bosom friend.  He has whispered in my ears of the evil Lord Grimrot who walks your breast and whom you hold dear.  He has spoken of the beats you cling to in hopes it will save your dried ravaged dirt.  I fear you not.  I will beguile your dust.  I will turn your head as I pass through your children.  I will strike when you are not looking and make you think you meant me to strike so all along.  I will be one of you, and I will bring you down.  Your dreams will be reality and of my creation though you know it not.  You may be of the hammer of life, but I am the enchanter of your perspective and now you will be brought to heel.
