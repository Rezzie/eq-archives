The Ranger and the Warrior crept up on the camp, preparing to attack on the
signal from the archmage. As the first rays of light hit the valley the
signal came, as a bolt of fire exploded in the camp, sending the crew of
outlaws into the brush and the horses running. The Priestess summoned dark
magical energies but the spell was cut short by a volley of arrows from Bren,
bringing the priestess to the ground promptly. Pikeman charged Bastion as he
collected his equipment, engaging the dark warrior in a fierce melee.

As Porthios made his way into the fray, heading for the necromancer he is
sworn to kill, the gnome finished his chanting. He brought to life a huge
being of solid earth, towering high above the Paladin and Warrior standing
nearby. With both Bastion and the elemental to deal with they were forced to
step back, instantly pummeled by the extreme power of living earth. Bastion
took advantage of the pinned Warrior and struck several telling blows,
crippling the Warrior before the elemental crushed him. The Paladin fought
the elemental back, driving the being back to its master when the Archmage
struck it down with mighty blasts of lightning.

The Gnome frantically assaulted the paladin with spells to no avail, and was
struck down by the golden sword now hungry for Yvette's blood. The Paladin
shone with a holy light, seeming to reflect the powerful magics. Porthios
wiped his blade of the gnome to hear his Archmage make a gurgling sound. He
turned to see the Outlaw Dark Elf disappear into the tall grass, leaving the
archmage to bleed to death from two holes in his back.
<br><br>
Bastion had fled to where Yvette had hid, preparing her summons of a powerful
undead warrior.
