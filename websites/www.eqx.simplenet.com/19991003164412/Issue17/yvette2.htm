The founding fathers of the Academy for High Sorcery built a city on the premise that the pen was mightier than the sword, not to be used as one. The schools of thought that were built flourished in the ideas of a utopian race of humans who did not need war. That utopian race would never come about. As the fathers of Erudian science were laid to rest, the descendants grew a bit more like the men of the past. The need for military prowess became a popular topic of schooling. The ways of the arcane became as a lethal tool, honed like iron into steel by blacksmiths of thought. Even these founding fathers of Wizardry were respected as Erudites, being masters of the arcane and very exact in the arts. The mind became as the temples of worship to the High Wizards, and great works were written about this process. Yvette was busy categorizing these works in the buried tower.

She marveled at the quality of journals and accuracy of the maps. She read through the journal notes of one great thinker, the father of the Neo Invocation school of thought. His research would give birth to spells such as earthquake and the black energy storm, which are most commonly used to kill on a large scale, such as a town. Yvette doubted he meant for his work to be used as such, seeing his study of how the Gods killed was in attempt to prevent the city from sliding into the sea. She wondered what he would think if he knew what happened to his beautiful city. The she stopped and wondered how many had actually seen the future.

Would have the great thinkers of Erudite history have written the great arcane lore if they knew the future, even a glimpse? Now days the Academy was a human bakery, a cookie cutter assembly of Wizards accepting diplomas written without care of the individual students. The instructors of the arcane science came from the same molds as the students. They shared the same alphabet of spells and knowing the same histories. Perhaps if the great thinkers had known they would have written more. Giving more to be taught from generation to the next instead of leaving the greatest truths to be left buried in the sands. Perhaps they did try. Perhaps the truth is in this pile of books. Perhaps they just ran out of time, out of life.
