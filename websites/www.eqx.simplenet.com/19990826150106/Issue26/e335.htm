It's all fine and good that there are these games to play, but what is 
really going to happen with them?  EverQuest is backed by a huge company with
lots of resources and experience.  Even though SISA changed their name to a
number (what's next, Prince?), you can bet Sony has strict standards of
quality.  They know they have a potential landslide here with EverQuest,
and they will be sure to do their best to keep it that way in the long term
as well.  There is no doubt EQ will be a winner in the end.

Asheron's Call is also associated with a huge company with lots of resources
and experience.  But, the company is named Microsoft.  How many times has your
Windows crashed?  Hmmm.  What happened to Bill Gates at his big debut of
Windows 98?  Hmmm.  I can only guess that AC realizes they have a short term
game here, and will be trying to push it out the door before EQ sees the 
light.  They will hope to get some addicts before the players have a chance
to compare it to EverQuest.

Advantage: EverQuest
