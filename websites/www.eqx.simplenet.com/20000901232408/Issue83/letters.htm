<em>Oghma's response to Simeron's letter in last weeks <a href="../Issue82/letters.htm">letters section</a>.</em>
<br><br>
I don't know if you've ever read the <a href="../credits/oghma.htm">dwarven mythos</a> I created on EQX, but I made an entity for most of the things that dwarves are known for - Mining, Smithing and of course - Greed.  Oghma has sort of always fought against the negatives, so it's surprising that it (greed) got to him.  All in all, though, he's only human (er, a dwarf :)) and subject to everything he was born with and ingrained into him.  Thanks for your well thought out answer, it's a good direction to go in if if comes up.

A letter of agreement <em>- Regarding Archanalia's article <a href="../Issue81/identity.htm">Identity Crisis</a>.</em>
<br><br>
I've been reading your editorials at EQX about the whole boring clone problem in EQ. I'd just like to say I totally agree (though I'm sure you get lots of messages saying this).
<br><br>
I have been Everquest free for about a month now, and, instead, have been playing the beta of Asheron's Call (good thing I applied eh?) and I find it FAR more enjoyable. I'm not going to bash EQ or anything, but I feel I should say why AC feels better...
<br><br>
1. The character customization
<br><br>
So there are only three races to choose from, and they're all human, but, what makes the difference is that the faces are much more customizable. Just by changing the eyes and mouth, I can make a character who looks like a devious, sinister magic user...or an honorable, law abiding warrior.
<br><br>
Its not only the face; every part of the body relates to what you have equipped, and there are different colors, shades, looks (a baggy shirt compared to a normal shirt) which allows for even more fun. One character of mine wears the skin of the evil demon he killed, Barney (the colors of his clothes are green and purple, ie: green cap, purple shirt, green trousers and wrist bands, etc.). I just think that customization like this adds to the overall enjoyment.
<br><br>
2. Creature placement:
<br><br>
Differing from the slew of monsters running around city walls, in Asheron's Call, they are spaced out, and placed in appropriate spots: hiding in a field of trees, inhabiting the hills that surround a city, and so on.  Instead of them running around, randomly, and finding myself walking around, also randomly (most of the time, unless its to a specific camp or something), in search of them, I instead end up thinking as to where they might be positioned and going off with a fixed position in mind.
<br><br>
3. The question of grouping:
<br><br>
In Everquest, you *must*, without a doubt, group to advance through the later levels. I find it much easier in Asheron's Call to fight solo. I think this appeals to a lot of people who would rather fight alone, have all the responsibility and such in the battle, and still be able to advance.
<br><br>
4. Graphics:
<br><br>
In AC, the graphics aren't *as* detailed, but they're damn close to EQ, and an extremely high-end computer isn't needed, which is great for me and my rickety old P200, 32 megs of ram junk pile ;)  *speaking of playing on low-end machines, the way areas are spread out across many servers and preparing all the adjacent zones so that instead of loading the next one up, you can just switch to it seamlessly is genius!...With 32 mb of ram, zone loading in EQ took 2-3 minutes, seriously!* And after all, graphics aren't what really make a game are they?
<br><br>
5. The RPG factor:
<br><br>
As of right now, in beta, none of the NPC characters in town do anything but sell/buy items. Although this will definitely change before the release, it causes more social interaction, something I found a bit lacking in EQ. The way I see it, there are basically two ways to have a character background:
<br><br>
1. Base it on the surrounding area's stories *Mentioned in an editorial in EQX issue 82 about there not being many NPCs that said anything, therefore leaving the poor fellow with a pretty blank idea of what's going on, and no idea as to how he should act.*
<br><br>
2. Make it all up when you begin...or as you go along ;) *Due to the zero NPC social interaction so-far in AC, this is quite easy to do since there's more speaking between PCs.*  With all the characterization abilities, roleplaying in AC is a little easier... you can use your facial expression or clothes to help stand out from the crowds.
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
Actually I don't know where I'm really going with number 5, but it just feels slightly easier to roleplay in AC...easier to get into the character's mind if you want to ;D
<br><br>
Well, that's just an account from an ex-EQ player on the differences... I'm not bashing EQ... well, not *trying* to... just pointing out some if its faults and relating them to something else.

I just have to correct you on a minor point about your <a href="../Issue82/edita.htm">editorial</a>.  Yes,
emulators like the one you mentioned are perfectly legal.  But EmuQ, the
"server emulator" (hereafter referred to as a server clone), is not the
same sort of animal.  
<br><br>
An emulator allows machine instructions for one type of processor or
operating system to be interpreted and executed on a different type.  The
Playstation emulator you mentioned allows compiled Playstation games to be
played on a Mac.  The program basically translates the Playstation
instructions to Mac instructions, then tells the Mac to perform those
instructions.  That's perfectly fine, and has been done for years.  
<br><br>
The Everquest server clone doesn't do that sort of thing.  It takes input
from the client and sends the client output.  Programs that do that are
perfectly fine.  It's the writing and using of them that's the trouble.
Part 9 of the license agreement reads:
<br><br>
"You may not use any third party software to modify the Software to change
Game play. You may not use our intellectual property rights contained in
the Game or the Software to create or provide any other means through which
the Game may be played by others, as through server emulators. You may not
take any action which imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large
load on our infrastructure."  (They mean server clones...)
<br><br>
Creating a server clone would involve using the intellectual property
contained in EQ.  It's impossible to create a server clone without figuring
out what the client and the server say to each other, and it's impossible
to figure that out without using the client.  It's impossible to use the
client without agreeing the the license agreement.  Even using the server
clone would involve modifying the client.  
<br><br>
Whether or not Playstation emulators are legal, EmuQ and its ilk aren't.
No matter what legalistic tricks clone supporters propose.

Just wanted to let you know you have a great web page.  I am the production director at a newspaper here in Texas.  I think you definitely have caught the flavor of a newspaper.

Please pass this on to Zeryn.
<br><br>
I enjoyed you article in EQX issue 82. Curios though, do you ever find yourself speaking and acting "IC" when your not playing the game? Once after playing my Troll, I stayed in charecter for the start of my Dinner and Belive me i was quite the fool.
