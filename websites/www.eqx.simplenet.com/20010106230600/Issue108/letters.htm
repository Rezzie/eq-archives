<br><br>
You hit the nail right on the head regarding the issue of MU* players having
far more patience for changes and such in EverQuest than many of the people
who picked it up as a video game, not a MMORPG. Also, in addition to just
playing text-based MU*'s over the years, many of us have **RUN** the games
in one manner or another and have had to make the "nerfs" or mistakes that
Verant is now making. We smile when we see the big company making the same
mistakes we did or making ones we avoided or, even moreso, nodding when we
notice they fix a problem we couldn't.
<br><br>
From what I can tell, _most_ of the really avid complainers haven't spent
much time on MUD's or doing much online gaming outside of things like Quake,
Mechwarrior or so forth. Instant satisfaction isn't something you run across
when you build or manage online games and many of us "old timers" (even
though most are barely or not even 30 yet =) ... ) have learned far more
patience, I think, than those who require the instantaneous fun of normal
video games. To me, that marks the definitive difference between the two
major groups who play EQ: those who have the patiences to wait for long-term
satisfaction and those who want instantaneous satisfaction all the time no
matter how unreasonable that might be. We often label these people as
teenaged "brats" because it fits the image but some could be 50 years old
yet just far too used to being waited on or just never having interacted
with this sort of medium before and now finding it inherently frustrating.

<em>It's great to hear from someone with experience in the MU* world.  I think 
that many forget that Brad and much of his staff came from that kind of 
background, and enjoyed what the MU* world had to offer.  You could say the 
EQ is a big MUD with cool graphics, and not be too off the mark.
<br><br>
I think that your division of the EQ community into MU* players and player 
with more experience in Quake and single-player games is an interesting 
one, and illuminates some of the difficulties that people have with EQ and 
it's changes, enhancements, and updates.
<br><br>
In my less generous moments, I hope that those who are unhappy with EQ as 
it stands would just leave, and leave Norrath to those of us who are 
willing to play and wait and let the game evolve. :)

Hey there! My name's Chris, I just found your site yesterday... and I loved
it! Really funny stuff, guys :) Just one question... when should I look for
a new issue? Do you update saturday, sunday, or when?
<br><br>
Anyways, I was hoping you guys could contact Sir Maximus and tell him that
Bard's Log is GREAT! I love reading it, it's awesome!
<br><br>
Keep up the good work!

Greetings,<br>
     As I am reading through issue 107 I am looking and looking, but I don't seem to find the main thing I am seaching for.  Its so odd.  So I think to myself, I think I will write in and ask the simple question, and be as subtle about it as possible. So my question to you today is:   WHERE IS ASK OXESIESS!?!?!?!?   If you could respond as quickly as possible I would appreciate it.  Thanks.
