<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello all I have question for you. I am a Bard and would like to know why I am auto-targeted when grouped as some party members find this a little annoying. Also I was wondering why Bards can't use bow's and Paladins can (not a very honorable way to attack) if you could enlighten me on this I would be very grateful for your assistance.
<br>Thank you Koldar
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh dear, it's a pity they find the autotargetting annoying from a bard but not from a druid or a cleric or other spellcasters or healers?  Bard songs work much the same way as a  spell; if my song speeds you along your way my name will appear in your target box, for instance.  It's much more noticeable for bards, however, because our songs are ongoing.  You can tell them that the only time a song will auto target them will be when it is music that directly affects them thus it can be useful as a quick reference spot to check if heal is going after they call for it, etc.  As for the bows, you must remember that Bards are rogues and thus go in for stealthier approaches, particularly at higher levels.  No one said bards had to be honorable, particularly, but quite personally I have found bards to be honorable, clever, witty, kind, romantic, adventurous, intelligent, resourceful, and did I mention connoisseurs of fine libations.  Give the Paladin a bow and give me a song, a sweet glance and a delicious cool drink any day.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, I have heard _many_ different tips, hints and clues about smithing.  Can you confirm or disprove any of the following information?1. Having the "smithing books" in the inventory increase the chance of success2. Dwarves have a bonus to smithing3. Smithing success is based on your INT or WIS stat.  Thanks for the help.
<br>Korif
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever noticed how much flattery and coquettish stooping down to meet a dwarf's eyes it takes to get an answer to a question from one?  Or is it just me?  Luckily, however, I found a helpful fellow who tells me that having smithing books in your inventory will make no difference.  He also said that smithing success does relate to INT and WIS in much the same way that other skills do.  Finally, he gave me a curious answer to the question of dwarves having a bonus for smithing.  His response was, "tell him its being investigated."  There appears to be a possibility that those stocky and strong arms of dwarves might have something to do with the power of their smithing skill.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In issue 89 a questioner inquired about the making of certain pies... I wish to learn more.  In my baking experience, one cannot make ANY pies, as that requires CLUMP OF DOUGH, which cannot be made!  (At least not by the listed recipe of Flour + Milk + Snake Egg.)  I get the message "Those items do not combine it that quantity." when I try to make dough.  My baking skill is near 30 with my level 16 Cleric and I'm ready to give up on baking (and especially on my other chosen skill - Tailoring) as there seems to be no benefit.  Two questions arise:  1)Can dough be purchased from a merchant and if so, where?  2) What is Verant's plan to make various skills worthwhile?  (Not just baking / tailoring, as my perusal of various boards shows that almost ALL skills have legitimate beefs, bugs and deficiencies.  I think also that the VAST MAJORITY of EQ users do not expect skills to make them rich, but would enjoy the perceived status of reaching MASTER, or even the ability to make items with unique (even if minor) special abilities!  (Think Chicken Noodle soup that heals a little bit of health when consumed, or a tailored version of woven / netted armor etc!)

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't relate the replies I received as I raced through the countryside shouting, "Has anyone ever successfully baked a pie in Norrath?"  Suffice it to say, that nowhere did anyone step forward with a helpful comment.  Although the person I spoke with last week did say that he had baked pies and used a clump of dough, he seems to have gone incognito and I could find him nowhere to ask again.  Thus, it seems that the potential for buying or making dough is there but unfortunately I cannot answer your question any better.  Perhaps a reader can help us both on that.  I'm intrigued with your second question and its ramifications, particularly chicken noodle soup that heals.  Oh wait, that would do me out of a job.  Perhaps we could find a dish that would make all the hearers of bard music cast platinum instead of copper at the feet of the bard?  I think you're onto something here and would heartily invite you to write to eqfeedback@verant.com and pass along the soup suggestions.  If you have time, would you also ask them to change tailoring so that tailors can make dresses that bards can wear?  You'd have all my business if you could make me a silken gown for those quiet cozy chats by the fire in the tavern.  Or do clerics want to encourage such things?

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just wondering if you don't own the expansion when it comes out, will you be able to see the lizardmen PC's as lizard men when they travel to the rest of the world or will they look like something else or will they not appear at all? Thanks, this was something that was kinda bothering me.

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked around on this and several sources told me that Verant had posted that models of the new race will be downloadable for free when the expansion pack comes out.  I invite anyone with more knowledge or understanding on this to let me know.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first began to play EverQuest there were only a dozen or so servers available to the players. Circumstances not under my control forced me to quit the game for a few months. I'm back now and the first thing I noticed was the addition of new servers, most notably the addition of the "PvP team" servers. My question is how do these new pvp team servers work and how are they different from the other servers?
<br>Vehnyala 
<br>Agom
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The new "PvP Team" servers have different coding than either the PvP server of Rallos Zek or the so-I've-heard-them-called "carebear" servers that have only the  PvP switch option.  The team servers are divided into groups by compatible races and the hometowns have been reset to foster having the teamed races close to each other.  Thus, if Nepenthia lost her mind and decided to do some PvP playing, I'd go to the new server and create a half-elf character whose only choice of hometown would be Kelethin as her teammates would be high elves and wood elves.  I could not kill any PC's of my own team, but, assuming insanity for Nep here again, if I wanted to kill other players on the other teams, I'd be free to try and they of course, would probably seek to bash my head in.  There are different looting rules as well on the PvP team servers and perhaps some other differences I've forgotten.  Despite my own personal aversion to harming other players with anything besides an occasion sour note, I understand that the Tallon Zek and Rallon Zek servers are great fun and I encourage you to go and experiment with race team play.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question of a spiritual nature.  I am a servant of Tunare, allowing wild creatures to live without fear of orcs and goblins.  But, in order to make armor, I have had to slay wolves!  There are just not enough pelts for sale.  How can I attone for such actions??  Also, what can I do with the pelts I get which are NOT ruined?
<br>Kelledrian
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well Tunare hasn't answered any questions of mine since I wrote that ummm limerick about her late one night and somehow it was passed along.  However, I do understand your quandary.  Surely even Tunare wouldn't wish you to go bare in your youth, but if your worship is sincere,  you might prefer to wear cloth and save your plat for the smithies rather than smushing the wild critters.  Not to mention, if you can rid the world of a few orcs, you might find useable or exchangeable gear from them.  As for the pelts themselves, the ones that aren't ruined have higher value and some use perhaps in quests for useful equipment.  You might wish to inquire of those you meet along the way to see if any make a request for pelts in an unruined condition.  I wish you luck and if Tunare should ever bless you with a visit, would you apologize for me for the limerick?
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Priestess of Tunare, and hence I wish to do Good. Friends have suggested I go with them to hunt Frogloks in Guk. However, I hesitate, since I believe Frogloks are "Good" creatures. Am I right? Or they deserve the same fate as the vile Orcs? What about the Kerrans? And the Aviaks? I do not wish to bring harm to innocents for my personal gain, so please inform me!
<br>Alruna
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm I stand in admiration of the true thoughtfulness of those who worship Tunare. and would guess that she indeed watches over the creatures in her charge.  From what I can learn, the Frogloks, the Kerrans and the Aviaks are all neutral at least and for some, might even be considered good.  None of these creatures you name can be linked through evil to the vile orcs, etc. but there are those that each of these species take exception to.  For instance, Erudites cannot expect a kindly welcome from the Kerrans.  So, it seems that you must look to your heart and see if it will help you discern those who bear Tunare's mark and must be spared.  Sweetest fortune to you on your journeys.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Question related to last weeks editorial: What, exactly, constitutes an exploit? As a ranger, I usually carry a bow, and I have religiously avoided firing upon any creature that could not immediately pursue me and directly assault me. I was under the impression that all 'sniping' was considered an exploit. Is this the case, or is sniping allowed when the creature has no way to reach you . . .i.e. when you are actually out of reach in a location that is difficult or impossible for the creature to reach, as opposed to an easily accessible place that can not be reached because of a flaw in the pathfinding?
<br>Sarama
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think for a comprehensive discussion of exploits you might wish to visit the official Everquest Website (www.everquest.com) where under the section on "Support" you'll find explanations of exploits and other rules for play in the Guide/GM FAQ section.  Quoting from there, an exploit is "abusing a weakness or anomaly in the game system. An exploit provides advantage for one or more players with the intention of profiting from them in some manner."  In light of this, if you fire on a creature in a position where it cannot fight back and you can either cast on it or melee it without any damage or response back, it would be considered an exploit.  If the critter can engage you in anyway, chasing you or casting spells upon you, then it would not be considered exploiting for you to use your bow to start a battle.  You might have noticed recently however, that even stuck npcs seem to have a way of getting unstuck and fighting so perhaps exploiting questions will become fewer and less worrisome to you.  If in doubt, though, you can petition and ask a guide or GM if a given situation would constitute an exploit.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I and my friends want to play on the same server, but we have chars on different servers right now. I heard there would be some sort of quest so you could change the server and take your char and bank inventory with you?
<br>Seneca
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure where you heard of such a quest but everything I have heard from beta onwards is that once your character is on a server, the character, its skills and its items all must stay there.  I really haven't heard anything different on that at all and am pretty sure that there is no quest to move between servers.  What would be fun though would be for you and all your friends to head for one of the newer servers (one without a gazillion level 50 bards to be envious of), and all start new characters there, helping each other level up.  Hope you have a great time together!
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a kind of suggestion/question. With console systems, the big thing now (especially in Wrestling games) is create a player (the C-A-P in WWF Attitude is virtually mesmorizing, and brain straining). How much time would it take (if even feasible) and size would it take to add something like this into EQ? I myself think it would make EQ even greater, especially the fact that you don't see the same looking High Elf running past you all the time, when they're actually different people.
<br>Estolcles
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa, if we were playing stump Nep, you would have won for sure.  Except, luckily, I took your question to some players who seem to understand the mechanics of Everquest more clearly than I do.  Although they are players and don't work for Verant, they all said that hardware limitations currently would prevent your suggestion from being implemented.  Anyone who wants to add more details to this is welcome to write and let me know.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can thank the bards Creediki and Elorin for the following list and if anyone finds a language that is missing, please let me know: One language Your list....for each race, common, thieves cant, giant, gnoll, orc, faerie, froglok, goblin, lizardman, dark speak, dragon, elder dragon, elder erudite, elder tier-dal, elder elvish, and old combine empire"      Combine and Giant are the same language :)  Also Kobold and Elder-Tierdal.
<br>Sonoroud Tomebinder
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many thanks Sonoroud for writing in on this.  I sure appreciate it.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to a question asked this week, these are the different ways someone can look at you, from friendliest to least friendly:
<br><br>
warmlyamiablyindifferentlyapprehensivelydubiouslythreateninglyxxx scowls at you, ready to attack
<br><br>
I'm not sure if this list is complete, but these are all the cases I've found, and I'm sure of their order (I've gone from "amiably" to "warmly" by doing quests, so I'm fairly sure on that part).  Someone who considers you "dubiously" or below will not sell to you.  Someone who looks at you "threateningly" will usually (but not always) KOS you, and someone who scowls at you will always attack if you get too close, and they con blue or above.   Hope this helps!
<br>Jerrik
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerrik, thanks for sending this in.  Isn't it tempting to make up a little song from the list?  Giggle.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really a question, but some additional info for one of your answers in Issue 89.  In regards to the use of a quiver, a ranger friend of mine told me that the quiver is used as an ammo "auto-loader", that is, you can store 20 arrows in your ammo slot (max), but with a quiver, when that ammo slot drops to the last arrow, the bow will start drawing from arrows stored in the quiver, so you don't run out at an inopportune moment (unless you also use up all the arrows in the quiver).
<br>Gatlen
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;:  This isn't really a question, just some information in regards to a question on quivers in issue 89.  The difference between a quiver and a regular bag is that different kinds of arrows can be auto-loaded from a quiver to shoot them.  Where as a bag can only auto-feed arrows of the same kind.  For example, if you have a class 1 arrow in your ammo slot, and in a backpack you have class 1, 2, and 3 arrows, only the class 1 arrows will be fired until they run out.  Then you have to put a class 2 or 3 arrow into the ammo slot to prime the autofeed of the respective types.  If you had the arrows in the quiver, when you ran out of class 1 arrows, you would continue to fire with class 2 and 3 arrows without having to place another arrow in the ammo slot.  Hope this clears it up for you for future questions.
<br>Bortoas
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in response to the Quiver question. The quiver does indeed have a use in game.  When I first saw it I though it was a bag, indeed it is.  But this bag has a use.  To use the quiver all you have to do it place 1 arrow in your ammo slot, and fill your quiver with arrows. You can fit 80 I think.  Then when you fire the bow, it continually feeds arrows through, allowing you to have 81 arrows in your ammo, not a max of 20.
<br>Khalamar-, Bloodpawn of Oblivion, Keeper of Secrets
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question, but a comment on an answer. You cannot put anything into a quiver other than arrows. If you try, you receive a message to the effect that "quivers may contain only arrows."
<br>Romidar Trueblade
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is marvelous.  Each of you had a bit more information to add and Romidar corrected my silly assumption that quivers could be treated like extra luggage.  Thanks so much for taking the time to show that quivers are indeed quite useful.
