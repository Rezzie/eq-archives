Hoi there Lrets D'pearl here with the latest in news across the lands of Norrath. My latest story takes us to the seedy underground of Freeport and the beginning of what may be the bloodiest of turf wars between the Freeport crime syndicate and the "Mobs" &lt;pun intended&gt; of Paws. First some background information ...
<br><br>
There has always been something of a truce between the crime families in Freeport and the gnolls of Paws, albeit a slightly touchy one. Each gang kept to their respective areas of influence and did not encroach on the others' territories. However, it is a well-kept secret to those in Freeport that contraband could be shipped to remote areas of Halas and Qeynos much more quickly and cheaply were they to be given freedom to transport goods through South Karana; something the South Paw gnolls DO NOT want as this would compete with THEIR smuggling operations. This, sources say, has caused no end of tension between South Paw Gnolls and the Freeport "Families". Other sources also indicate that Mr. Kor'lionne had gone ahead shipping contraband through South Karana ANYWAY. Which brings us to today's story.
<br><br>
Troubles began earlier this week when Vincent Kor'lionne, nephew of Freeport business man and well-known philanthropist Vito Kor'lionne was found crucified, with his body chopped off at the waist. Clearly a message was being sent to Mr. Cor'lionne.

<EM><b>Troubles began when the body of Vito Kor'lionne's nephew washed up on the shores of the Oasis of Marr.</EM></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
South Paw Gnolls were not available to respond to accusations that they were responsible for the death of the young man. On the other hand , we WERE able to get an exclusive interview with Mr. Kor'lionne.
<br><br>
Lrets: So Vito can you tell me your thoughts on the reasons behind the death of your nephew?
<br><br>
Kor'lionne: You talkin' to me? Are YOU talkin' to ME!?
<br><br>
Lrets: Uh ... yes sir, I was. I was asking you your thoughts on your nephew.
<br><br>
Kor'lionne: I dunno nothin' 'bout that! I'm a business man! I just do business. I may have some ... errr ... enthusiasms (as he picks up a splintered club and walks behind my chair) But I DO NOT engage in violence ... &lt;shrugs&gt; It's bad for business.  Capiche?
<br><br>
Lrets: &lt;gulp&gt; Uh ... yes sir. So do you have any ideas about who may have done this.
<br><br>
Kor'lionne: &lt;glares off into space as he grips the club tighter&gt; ... You know ... I dunno, but when I find the slimy bastar... errr that terrible culprit ....&lt;turns purple and maniacally swings the club all over the place .. missing my head by a fingers width&gt; I want him DEAD! I want his family DEAD! I wanna walk up to his grave and I wanna piss in his coffin! YA HEAR ME! I WANT HIM DEAD! &lt;SMASH-CRASH-BAM-SWING&gt;
<br><br>
At this time, this reporter found it prudent to leave the poor man to his grief. Two days after this interview, the eldest son of the South Paw Gnoll Commader was found dead as the result of a freak accident. Apparently, he tried to reach in and change a switching mechanism on one of the famous Qeynos Giant Rat traps, while blind folded, pumped up with Jum-Jum juice and screaming out "Help me! Help me!"

<EM><b>Later this week the heir apparent of the South Paw gnolls was found slain in a freak accident with a Qeynos Giant Rat Trap. Foul play has not been excluded as a possible option.</EM></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
When asked for his reaction to this seemingly coincidental accident local crime bos... errr I mean respected philanthropist Vito Kor'lionne stated, "Hehehe... uh... errr... I mean...&lt;sob&gt; What a terrible was for a boy to go ...&lt;snicker-coughcough&gt; It's just so ... &lt;snicker-gigglegiggle&gt; HORRIBLE .. WAHAHAHAHAHAHAH... muHAHAHAHAHAHAH!" This reporter was unable to complete this interview as Vito was overcome with anguish and grief over the accident.
