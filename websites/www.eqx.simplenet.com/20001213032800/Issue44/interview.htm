<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Today we are joined by BlkStaff aka Khelben, IRC channel op of #everquest. 
<DD>   Can you tell us briefly what you do for a living? </I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: I'm in the Quality Assurance department of Multitude
<DD>   They make an online game called FireTeam which is currently in the final stages of the beta program.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: I've had the pleasure of participating in the FireTeam beta test, but can you tell our readers a little bit about what FireTeam is?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Well, it's an action oriented game that promotes team play and uses real time voice to help accomplish it.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Do you have any interesting non-game hobbies?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Not currently anything interesting, though I guess you could call trying to run #everquest a hobby. I gave up my hobbies for work :-)
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: I suppose some people call that dedication.  </I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: And some call that crazy...
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Where did you first hear about EverQuest?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: I saw EverQuest at the 97 E3, when it was in very early stages of alpha. I also talked to some of the Dev team when they haunted the halls of Tanarus, 989's other online game.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: How did that lead to you becoming the all-powerful #everquest op that you are today?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: All-powerful? Hahahah, well I suppose you could say I took over the channel when there were no ops, but that was a long time ago, when Dach and Xeth were having problems running the channel with only two of them, so Oberon and myself came in and offered to help out.  
<DD>   I'm not all powerful, btw, just a regular op in a game channel. If people view me as that... it's their mistake. :-)
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Hehe, well I was just being facetious with the all-powerful part. ;)
<DD>   As an #everquest op, what is your relationship to the game designers, particularly Brad McQuaid?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Basically we both use each other for a few things. They use our channel for the 989 chats, and we use them for the information they release about the game to get us more pumped for release.  We are just trying to get as much information as we can to the information-starved gaming public.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Would you say you have an inside advantage in that you talk with them and they respond to you, outside of the public forums?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Nah, from the very beginning we made it known that we didn't want special favors.  We are doing it for the love of the game. Nothing else.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: How long can we expect the #everquest chats with Brad and company to continue?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Well the dev team has been extremely busy, and it's getting easier to get information spread through other sources, like the numerous web pages out there.  But also, we haven't had a chat in a while, since there is not that much new info that can be released, from what I understand.  Once they are able to release more, then we certainly will hold another chat if the dev team is up for it. :)
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: What do you see the #everquest channel becoming, after the game is released?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Honestly?  Whatever the people want it to be. It's very hard to moderate a channel well, especially when it continues to grow in size.   I could turn into just another channel with people shouting whose guild is better.  I think the current ops and myself will try to not let that happen, but we can't control everything.
<DD>   It's whatever the people that come in want to make it. I hope that it will be a meeting place for when they are not playing the game, and to find people to travel with in EQ.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Tell us about your first experience with an online, multiplayer game.  Did you get addicted?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Addicted? *laugh*  You could say that.  My first online game was called CyberStrike on the GEnie network, which is basically what Tanarus was based off of.  But, yes, I was addicted, and ran up a large bill since it was a long distance call to log in. :)
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Since you have your foot in the door in the gaming industry, perhaps you have some insight into this one.  Where do you see the future of online games heading?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Umm wow, you think having my foot in the door gives me any insight whatsoever?  Heh.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Okay, take a wild stab in the dark then. ;)</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Mmm... Well, it's all still pretty risky. Some companies are taking the jump into this industry and are trying to forge a new niche or improve on some old ones.  I think that we will see more online games, of course, but as a gamer, I'm really looking for one with a strong community aspect, which is lacking in almost all the online games I've seen.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Are you primarily a powergamer or a role-player when it comes to RPGs?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: If you could mix the two together, that's what I would be. :)
<DD>   It all depends on the group of people I'm traveling with, but I've always been big into role-playing.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Did you play Ultima Online?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Yes, I started in alpha and played till final.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: What was the biggest letdown you experienced in UO's final, and how do you think the same issue will pan out in EverQuest?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: I think UO added too many untested features for final, which meant there was an extremely large amount of bugs at release, and they spent all their time tuning and fixing these problems well into final. They also had very bad online support.
<DD>   Those were the big issues I had with UO. All I can say about EQ is they've seen what UO became and how it came about, so they have that advantage.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Do you believe EverQuest will live up to its hype?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: I wouldn't know, but the hype is always a level above a game, it seems, so it all depends on how the public views the final product. :)
<DD>   But, it will have my support and $$. :-)
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: What type of character do you plan to play in Norrath?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Haven't really thought about it. I will probably try a lot of them out and find the one that fits into my idea of fun. :)
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: What about PvP?  Switch on or off?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Depends what everyone else is doing. If the monsters are tuned so that I never  want to kill a player because it's just as challenging going dungeon crawling, then I'll play with it off.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: What is your opinion of guilds?  Will you join one?  Why or why not?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Guilds don't really matter to me.  If I find a great group of people in game that I enjoy playing with, then I'll join their guild if it adds to the entertainment value. :)  But, otherwise, I'll just travel around and try to make some friends that I can play with along the way :)
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: If you had one wish for what you would like to see included in EverQuest, what would it be?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Oooo. GOOD question.
<DD>   I want bunnies.
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Doh!</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Heheh.  No matter how hard the dev team resists... deep down they know they want bunnies.
<P>
[...long pause...]
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Sorry, I was yelling at a person. *sigh*  Never a dull moment.
<DD>   Warning to you all, you will lose half your sanity trying to run a channel. The other half I suggest storing in a safety deposit box for when you are done.
<DD>   I've lost almost all of mine..  I should be a poster child with the caption, "Don't let this happen to you!"
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Okay, last question.  What is your favorite FireTeam character?</I>
<P>
<DT><B>BlkStaff</B>: Haha. I like the scout, she is fast has a wide vision cone and is killer in close combat
<P>
<DT><I><B>Wynn</B>: Thank you for taking the time to answer some questions.  Anyone interested in learning more about FireTeam can visit Multitude's web site at <A TARGET=new_browser HREF="http://www.fireteam.com">www.fireteam.com</A>.  </I>
