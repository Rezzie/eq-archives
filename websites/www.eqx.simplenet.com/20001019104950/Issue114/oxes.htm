<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
 Alright, here goes.  I met a wood elf bard in the Neriak prison  recently, busted him out, and him, his troll friend, and I all escaped.  We were trying to get to Erudin but ended up in the desert, then the swamp, then the desert, got captured by orcs, got away, and here we are now.  My question is: He doesn't seem to like me. Not as much as I like him, anyway.  Geez, I think the troll likes me more than he does, and the troll likes him more than he likes me... just not in the same way.  Not the same was as I like him anyway, the Bard I mean, not the troll. He likes him in a different way than I like the bard but I think he likes both of us in the same way, the troll and I, I mean.  Am I confusing you? If I am you're gonna have to put it aside for a moment because the reason to why he doesn't like me the same way I like him but not the same way he and I like the troll is utterly driving me nuts.  Thank you.

Dear Lanys,
<br><br>
Humm….  Lemme walky wiff this jist a sec and see iffen I's a follow'n ya's...  like look'n at the back side o a cub ya's think'n bout bash'n but momma is near so ya's gotta wait until it waddles off…
<br><br>
Okay ya's met a Flooter Tooter.  Dat's trouble right der ya's know?  He's not gonna liker yer poems no matter what ya's do…  So!  Ya's meet dis Flooter Tooter, he's in trouble.  He's also gots a pet troll he keeps around cause…  well…. we git to dat later.
<br><br>
So ya's gots lots o likes goin around here, but none in da right ways fer da way dat ya's wanna it ta go.  And everyone else is a like'n someone else but da rights personage and do'n it in da wrong way in da a like while in da direction ya's ta like it to.  Do I's gots it?
<br><br>
Well ere's what I thinky, ya's gotta consider, what's da Flooter Tooter doin wiff a troll ta begin wiff?  Why's he travel'n wiff a troll when da troll will prolly open his mouth ta sing and make da frogloks swoon iffen da Tooty plays?  Prolly cause da troll will feel what's I's feel when I see a Holy do Medicine.  AWE.  Ayeps dat's it AWE.  Ya's sit'n der, bleed'n from everythin but yer little toe and dey pick ya's up off da ground.  Perhaps since ya's so strong and stuff..  I mean ya's got him outta a fix and everything, he done feel, well…  not like da lead sled doggie.  He feel like yer da super bashy and he's jist da barb-cub.  Ya know girly ta girly, da guys are super sensitive bout their, being able ta be a guy.  
<br><br>
Ya know…  they wanna look… <u>guyly</u>.  So give him da chance ta be super guy and I's bet when ya's go "Oh yer da most brave, wonderful, bashy hero I's done ever seen!  I would have been done fer wiffout ya's!" &lt;bat yer lashes while say'n this&gt;, he gonna like da right way again.  Is only a lil white fib, we gotta do dat stuff sometimes cause, well ya's know, dat guyly thingy.

<em>Lady Bashy Oxesiess,
<br><br>
I have a problem, maybe you can help me out. I'm a Paladin of Karana who is questing for his Holy Armor of Ro. Today I discovered that in order to get this fine armor, I must kill Fairies! Yes, those poor little defenseless CUTE little Fairies! You see, the god Brell Serilis requires that I bring his priestess bags and bags of fairy dust in order to get his precious Soil of Underfoot. This soil is required in the forging of the armor. When all is done, a full suit of the Armor of Ro will cost the lives of HUNDREDS of fairies. I just cant do it! I cant bring myself to kill the fairy princess and her friends and do Brells dirty work for him! Am I doing the right thing? Why are the gods so cruel to ask us to do this horrible deed?

Dear Knight o Thunder'n,
<br><br>
I's gots a question.  Ya's know I meeted a dwarf one day and asked him why he short stumpy.  He done tolded me he followed his Father.  Da Duke o below nameded Brell.  And <b>DATS</b> why he was stumpy.  I's wanna know iffen ya's gots time ta write back, why their super important daddy is stuck in da ground?
<br><br>
Also on dis fairy business and stuff.  Ya's sure it's REAL faires?  I's once thinked, something wiff wings was something wiff wings and it was neato when ya's thwaped em dat dey went "Ohahahhhhh!" splut!  In fact I's liked it so much I's din care dat I's gotted no learn'n from em.  Jist wanted ta hear da "Ohhh Ahhhh!" splut sound. 
<br><br>
Den da ranger done told me, not all faires da same and ta stop.  I's said what's ya's mean?  Dey all go "Ohhhahhh!" splut da same?   And he done saided "Oxes is da Mammoth and da Elephant da same?" Well I's snorted at him and said "O COURSE NOT! Da Mammoths better eat'n once ya's gots da fur off em."  Den he done said dat even though da Mammoths and da Elephants keel over and thump da same, dey different cause one is hairy and taste better da other isn't hairy and don't taste so stinky good.  Dat it's da same wiff faires, some jist aren't as good.  Welpers I's can understand dat, but!
<br><br>
Ya's gotta member, it's all jist good bashy.  Sure maybe dey cute, heck a finger wiggler hold'n a dolly while in a dress is cute, but ya's thinky dat dunt mean he's not gonna cast da wicked majiks and stuff?  Heck no!  I's had lots o finger wigglers cast wicked majiks on me so I's float'n off da ground and stuff.  Then I's git all lost in me balance going up and down wiffout touching da ground and sick up.

<br><br>

<br><br>
