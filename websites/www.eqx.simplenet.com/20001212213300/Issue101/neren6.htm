	He cast another spell, and an Orc glared at him in surprise, then fell.  Duror finished it with a quick swipe of his staff.  He turned to the next, striking it to gain its attention.  The Orc lacked a weapon, but its red eyes showed eagerness and determination.  Duror ended its bloodlust soon enough.
<br><br>
	Duror was just a pawn in the battle, an Elf lost in a world of conflict, an insignificant dot within a war-filled picture.  Yet although he realized this, he kept on fighting.  The words: <em>for Kelethin!</em> continuously erupted in his mind.  <em>For Tunare!</em> he shouted.  <em>For Norrath!</em>
<br><br>
	He concentrated again and easily slew an Orc pawn that was waiting for its next easy opponent.  He found another pawn, grabbed its staff, and crushed its head.  He tucked in the staff for later use.  He shouted in surprise when an explosion near him sent him flying through the air.  The druid hastily oriented himself, swinging his staff down, and thus finishing an Orc legionnaire whom a Dwarf was having trouble with while landing skillfully on his feet.  That strange tingling sense of evil warned him of danger.  He twirled, swinging his staff.  Duror struck something, and a second later, only a Dark Elf's corpse remained in his vision.
<br><br>
	As he was turning around to survey the scene, a loud roar filled the air, blasting Duror into the air a second time.  At least that's what Duror felt, but as he rose, he spotted a large axe incoming.  With his fortunately naturally high agility and a little luck, he succeeded in dodging the blow.  It was a Minotaur attacking him.  <em>What are they doing around here?</em> Duror thought.
<br><br>
	Suddenly, a voice shouted, "Retreat, it's a trap!"
<br><br>
	<em>No, it can't be.  We've gone too far!</em>  However, he observed the Minotaurs attempting to flank the Elvish-Dwarvish-Gnomish counterattack.  To his left, he saw a line of explosions kill several Gnomes and Elves who were holding their position.  Jumping backward, Duror avoided a Minotaur's blow and the nearing fireballs.
<br><br>
	Still, Duror refused to retreat, retaining his position.  To his right, a High Elf motioned for him to follow him, assuming the druid was confused, but Duror dismissed him while dodging another blow.
<br><br>
	An audible tang was heard when two axes met his staff.  He pushed them back, kicked one of the Minotaurs in the chest and swung at the other before they could recover.  A Teir'Dal rogue was attempting to backstab him, but Duror had sidestepped as he was parrying the Minotaurs weapons.  Duror felt that tingling sensation again and struck to his left.  The rogue evaded the blow, and tried to thrust his dagger into Duror's throat.  Unfortunately for the Dark Elf, Duror had once again sidestepped, anticipating the assault.  Grinning, proud at his accurate intuition, he turned around, bringing his staff to his left and up, whacking the Dark Elf into the air.  Duror failed to stop the staff's inertia and consequently, the Dark Elf managed to return to his feet.  However, the Dark Elf met his end when the druid confronted him with a powerful gust of wind that ripped his soul back into the fertile land of the Greater Faydark.
<br><br>
	Duror saluted the tree nearest the corpse, trusting it would destroy the image of evil before him.
<br><br>
	Suddenly an eruption of fire knocked him to the ground.  As he struggled to rise, a club knocked him down again.  At once, Duror lay still, hoping his attacker would leave.  Instead, he felt another blow.  The pain mounted, and Duror was forced to release his hold on his staff.  After the next hit, his senses dulled; the pain left, causing Duror to panic.  Barely managing to avoid the next impact, he thrust his feet at his opponent's face.  His eyes closed because of grit, he heard an Orc grunt.  The enraged Orc grabbed Duror, threw him to the earth again face-first, and began pounding Duror again.  Soon, even his dulled sense of touch sprang back to fiery life, sending jolts of pain down his back.
<br><br>
	Desperately, Duror groped around for his staff.  Once he finally recognized the smoothness of a "stick", he summoned his reserves of energy to escape the next hit.  He turned to his side, gritting his teeth in pain, and thrust his weapon towards where he thought the Orc was.  He was awarded with a grunt.  When he opened his eyes, his heart fell when he saw that he was fighting an elite Orc oracle, recognizing that it was casting magic.
<br><br>
	"By the will of Tunare, burn!" the druid shouted.
<br><br>
	The oracle couldn't understand the rapid speaking of Duror's Elvish, but it understood his actions.  He beat Duror again with his club but failed to break Duror's concentration.  The Orc jumped back to avoid the burst, but the flame scorched its hands, forcing it to release its weapon.  Although casting spells on the ground has been proven difficult and nearly impossible for those with wounded appendages, Duror successfully cast another spell that formed spiked vine-like roots around the oracle's feet.  Even though the Orc was unsuccessful in breaking the roots' grasp, it threw his weapon at Duror, inflicting one more blow on Duror.  The resulting injury was a broken arm, but Duror barely felt anything.
<br><br>
	Duror struggled to return to his feet, but the pain was overwhelming. He couldn't even feel his legs.  A Dwarf found him and pulled him out of the oracle's range of casting.  With the battle raging around him, the brave Dwarf bandaged some of Duror's wounds.
<br><br>
	"Don't," gasped Duror.  "Let me die.  Leave me.  The Reviver will make good use of my soul."
<br><br>
	"No! You can't!  The Banisher has arrived here with the Teir'Dal!  You can't die!  Remember NaturesWord and his army at Neriak?  Just hang on, okay?  Let me find a healer."
<br><br>
	Duror found out he couldn't move his right arm and legs.  He knew his back had been crushed because of its empty dullness.  His heart seemed fainter by the second.  Duror was terrified.  He couldn't even cast the Minor Healing spell.
<br><br>
	"Tunare help me…"
<br><br>
	No answer came to his mind.  However, after a while, he felt no dismay.  He felt tired, and his thoughts slowed.  Two voices spoke in his mind:
<br><br>
	<em>My life had meaning.  I fulfilled it.<br>
	What meaning?<br>
	It doesn't matter.  I did it.<br>
	Did what?<br>
	Survived.<br>
	You're dying!  Duror, stop being stupid…  Oh well, I'm going to die anyway…<br>
	I survived.<br>
	Ah, I see now…I see…<br>
	Yes, so content, isn't it?<br>
	What is the purpose of life anyway?<br>
	It doesn't matter…<br>
	But why?…</em>
<br><br>
	Duror's heartbeat stopped.  He had never even received the chance to answer his own thoughts.
<br><br>

	Luegwen was sneaking upon a hapless, rooted Orc.  He smiled with anticipation, preparing for the strike.  The roots were beginning to weaken, but Luegwen wasn't bothered.  Taking a quick glance to his side, he saw his fellow squad members retreating.  One was looking around and Luegwen knew she was looking for him, but he didn't dare give away his position at the moment.  He ducked, his peripheral vision providing him vital information.
<br><br>
	<em>Now!</em>  He raised his dagger, keeping the blade from the sunlight, lest the shine would reveal his position.  Seconds later, the Orc was dead.  Luegwen withdrew the dagger and sneaked away.  His dagger, magical as it was, was unstained.
<br><br>
	At that point, his luck faltered.  A clumsy Orc centurion came over to investigate and accidentally bumped into Luegwen.  Luegwen scrambled to his feet, but he was already in plain view.  Without even sparing a quick look around him, he leaped into the sky.  Below him, the Orcs crashed, and Luegwen landed skillfully on their heads.  Bouncing from Orc to Orc, the rogue reached a clearing.  Two Dwarves, a warrior and cleric, were rushing toward a large bush.  Luegwen called for help.  Soon enough, the Dwarves were running toward him.
<br><br>
	Despite the initial illusion that his luck was returning, it failed again.  Gnolls on the other side of the clearing were beginning to surround them while the Orcs reorganized and rushed toward them with a roar.
<br><br>
	"I've always wished to die with honor," the warrior Dwarf said.
<br><br>
	The cleric nodded grimly.
<br><br>
	Luegwen's felt neither nervous nor scared.  His eyes were determined to fight… and die.  His anxious hands fingered his dagger.
<br><br>
	The Dwarves were the first to die, the warrior by a thrust through his chest, and the other beheaded.  Luegwen's fine Elvish agility kept him alive for a while, and he reckoned he had killed four already.  "For Tunare!" he shouted, pouncing upon a Gnoll.  After he finished it, something struck his leg, and he collapsed.
<br><br>
	He muttered something about thanking Renidyen for letting him slay more enemies.  When he opened his eyes, all he saw was a sword coming down on him.  Strangely enough, a sense of relief swept through him.  Luegwen let his head roll to his left.
<br><br>
	"Duror?…" was all he could say before the steel met flesh.
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">

	Gilerrin was the first to break the silence with a nervous cough.  Afterwards, the room seemed to come alive.
<br><br>
	"We'll have to contact everyone to abandon Kelethin," Heartwood said quietly.
<br><br>
	"I don't think they'll respond too nicely.  We Elves follow old customs too much.  In a way I agree with Renidyen - we are just too conservative, compared to Humans, that is.  I mean, it's understandable if an old Human believed in 'children,' being the superstitious idiots they are.  But Elven elders believing in a youth?  Ha!" said Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	Neren smirked with annoyance, Renidyen beamed with pride, and Heartwood grinned at the irony.
<br><br>
	"Aye, so we can count out everyone in Kelethin… except for some of our friends.  We'll need supplies.  Let's see, we'll need at least seven packs of supplies to last at least ten days," said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	"I can't believe this," said Blossom.
<br><br>
	"I'm not going," said Heartwood.
<br><br>
	"What?" Neren said.
<br><br>
	"Me neither," said the other adult Elf.
<br><br>
	Trueshot gestured he also had plans to stay.
<br><br>
	Neren was about to object, but Heartwood said, "It's only proper to protect my homelands to the death."
<br><br>
	The other Elf nodded.  "When you grow older, you'll discover that our home is even more important than yourself."
<br><br>
	"But I know that feeling," said Neren.  "I've felt it before…and -"
<br><br>
	"No, you don't know what's it's like, but you will later in your life," said Trueshot.
<br><br>
	Neren was about to protest, but Gilerrin interrupted.  "Listen, Neren.  Don't even try… and don't even say 'but.'  It's their decision, not yours.  If they want to stay, let them.  It's for the glory of Tunare."
<br><br>
	<em>But Tunare won't die here</em>, Neren thought.
<br><br>
	"I can't believe it," repeated Blossom.
<br><br>
	"So who's going?" said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	"So far, we have only four," said Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	"If Blossom's coming with us," said Neren.  "Wait, can anyone here bake or something?  It would be nice if we could brew some stew out of foraged -"
<br><br>
	"I can't believe this!" said Blossom.
<br><br>
	"You had better get used to the idea, then," said Neren.  "I could feel - no - I know I just had a dream from the Reviver."
<br><br>
	"It's just a dream…"
<br><br>
	"An important dream from the spirits of Norrath.  Come on, we have to get moving.  Gilerrin, Renidyen, we - Blossom are you coming or not?"
<br><br>
	"Let me pack some supplies for you kids," muttered Heartwood.
<br><br>
	"Hold on!  We have to figure who's going and who isn't.  We need to check if anyone - we can count out all the senior people - in Kelethin wants to join us… if they would believe us at all."
<br><br>
	"Ok, I'll stay here, and sew some backpacks for you; they're larger and longer-lasting than those standard ones."  Heartwood paused.  "Hmm… I haven't practiced tailoring in years."  He wandered around the room, looking for his sewing kit.
<br><br>
	Neren turned to the others.  The other two elders left, seeing that if they weren't going, they could at least help prepare food and drink.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin chuckled.  "Heartwood called us kids."  He wanted to see if that annoyed anyone.
<br><br>
	"Kids?" snorted Blossom.  "I'm nineteen!"
<br><br>
	"Twenty - more than a year passed while you were asleep.  And you're are kid compared to how old Heartwood and the others are," said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	"Well, are you?" Neren interrupted, facing Blossom.
<br><br>
	"What?  Oh, yes, of course I'll come," said Blossom.  Then, she apparently noticed her clothing.  "What's this?  Elvish clothing?  No wonder I feel so cramped.  Is there a dressing room here?  Hey!  And where are my clothes?  Damn, I almost feel naked.  If Te'Anara saw me in this outfit…"
<br><br>
	Suddenly, someone from outside the building began laughing lightly.
<br><br>
	"I heard that," Gilerrin said, staring straight at the doors.
<br><br>
	At once, the voice stopped.  Gilerrin, with a smirk pasted on his face, opened the doors.
<br><br>
	"Tinky?  What are you doing here?"
<br><br>
	Blossom didn't even greet her as she passed her, hurrying to the Scouts of Tunare where her old clothes and equipment were bundled.  Tinky frowned at her fading figure.
<br><br>
	"Chrysia?"  Heartwood had heard Gilerrin.  "I thought you were at the inn.  I told you to wait there until I came."
<br><br>
	"I did, but you didn't come for hours."
<br><br>
	Then Heartwood realized how late it was.  "Oh, my apologies."  He narrowed his eyes.  "What were you doing all this time?"
<br><br>
	"Well, uh, I kinda sneaked into Neren's room."  Neren's expression immediately changed.  Tinky, grinning, continued.  "I found a little compass there -"
<br><br>
	"Tinky!" shouted Neren.
<br><br>
	"I didn't do anything to it… well, except for a few things."
<br><br>
	"Tinky!" Neren shouted even louder.
<br><br>
	"I changed it into a little magical telescope with all the abilities of a compass and watch."
<br><br>
	"You shouldn't mess with my belongings, Tinky.  Especially that compass."
<br><br>
	"But I made it better."
<br><br>
	"But you don't realize what you just did.  You just practically ruined my mother's own magical creation.  It's not just a compass; anybody that holds it gains the ranger ability of enhanced tracking!  You just wrecked the only artifact my mother left for me!"
<br><br>
	At this, Tinky paused, but afterwards, shook her head.  "Now, I know you're lying."
<br><br>
	Neren's fingers itched to tear her apart.  "Tinky!  This <em>is</em> magical!  I am <em>not</em> lying!  Tunare!  Don't you see what you have just done?!  My only permanent memory of her…"
<br><br>
	Tinky smile faded, her eyes watering.  Heartwood opened his mouth, but Neren had already realized what he had done.
<br><br>
	"Don't cry, I didn't mean to be angry.  It's okay -"
<br><br>
	Gilerrin and Renidyen rolled their eyes.  Neren struck them with piercing eyes.
<br><br>
	Tinky shied away, hiding her face.
<br><br>
	"Tinky, it's alright," said Neren.  "I didn't mean to hurt you, I was just… annoyed.  It'll be fine - I'll still have my mother in my mind and -"
<br><br>
	"Can I have a hug then?" said Tinky, innocently.
<br><br>
	"Oh Tunare," Neren muttered under his breath.  <em>Why does she have to be such a baby?  When I was ten, I never did this.  No wait, she's nine, nearly three years younger than I am.  Still…</em>
<br><br>
	Gilerrin and Renidyen tried to suppress their laughter, but Neren heard them.  This time Heartwood glared at them.  Immediately they stopped.  However, their mouths, although shut, formed a half smile.  Blossom was still elsewhere, changing, while the two other adults were at a tavern, buying food.  Neren stared pleadingly at Heartwood, but the elder only nodded to Neren.
<br><br>
	And so Neren uneasily embraced her and held her loosely, while Tinky held him as tightly possible and began crying into his shirt.  It felt uncomfortably awkward to Neren.  <em>Tunare, no other girl does this.</em>
<br><br>
	At this Gilerrin and Renidyen, in spite of the serious situation, laughed loudly.  A fuming Neren refused to look at them.  Heartwood glowered at them again, yet the pair still laughed away.
<br><br>
	As the seconds passed, Tinky seemed to never want to let go.  <em>Hurry up, hurry up, hurry, up…</em>  was all Neren could think.  But Tinky was obviously thinking the opposite; she buried deeper into his shoulder.  Heartwood narrowed his eyes, concerned at this behavior.  "Chrysia."
<br><br>
	Tinky press closer to Neren.  Neren let out a sigh of annoyance.
<br><br>
	"Chrysia," Heartwood repeated.
<br><br>
	At last, she let go and turned toward Heartwood with a tearstained face.
<br><br>
	"Chrysia, what's wrong?"
<br><br>
	She looked away.
<br><br>
	"Did you do something else with Neren's property?  Bad day?  Is the battle worrying you?  Are you parents all right?  Chrysia, tell me.  Please, I don't have the patience of a father."
<br><br>
	For a while, she refused to speak.
<br><br>
	"Chrysia, please tell me what's wrong.  If it comforts you, tell Neren instead."
<br><br>
	Neren blushed at this.
<br><br>
	Tinky sniffed loudly.  To Neren, she said, "My mom and dad… they… they died.  I… I saw them fall with my own eyes."
<br><br>
	The room seemed to gasp.  Renidyen's eyes became stoic while Gilerrin's widened, their breath caught in mid-laugh.  <em>She's pretty tough,</em> thought Neren, remembering her recent happy mood that had covered her sorrow.  <em>But does she know about the Banisher?</em>  Neren's heart fell.
<br><br>
	Heartwood tried to put his hand on her shoulder to comfort her, but she wrapped her arms as tightly as possible around Neren again.  Heartwood sighed.  "I know how you feel, Chrysia.  I'm so sorry… if only you would've told me earlier -"
<br><br>
	"No!  Only Neren understands.  He had his parents killed before.  Right, Neren?"
<br><br>
	Neren shifted, suddenly breathing heavily.  <em>She does know.  How can she stand this pain?  Is she too young to understand?  When I was nine I endured the suffering… Can it be?  And D'Vinn.  Get out of my mind!</em>  Neren eyes blinked several times.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin knew to keep quiet, but Renidyen said, "You shouldn't say anything about death.  It's bad enough even to mention it."
<br><br>
	Neren recalled his lonely past, his distant visions of his father and mother.  He let out a deep sigh, and a strange coldness formed within his heart.
<br><br>
	Heartwood was standing, observing Neren.  Suddenly, he smiled.  "Neren, well, I think it's time to put some of your past behind you.  A bit of responsibility won't hurt.  Yes, I believe this would work."  Heartwood was grinning broadly now.  "Neren, I congratulate you for earning yourself a sister."
<br><br>
	Neren's jaw dropped.  He shook his head, letting warmth return to his body.  "You must be kidding.  I mean -"  Then he remembered that Tinky was listening.  "Er… I don't think I can handle this, um, responsibility… sir.  And I'm not sure if Tinky wants me or something…"
<br><br>
	"Neren - my brother.  I… I like the idea," said Tinky.  She wiped her face.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin had a surprised expression set in his face while Renidyen was obviously still hyper; he began laughing again.  "Give her a kiss, why don't you?" he ridiculed.
<br><br>
	This time, Neren ignored him, but Tinky had heard.  "Yes why don't you?" she said, attempting to tease him but not quite making the effect because of her tears.
<br><br>
	"Um… later."
<br><br>
	Renidyen made a choking sound and nearly stumbled, cackling.
<br><br>
	"It's not funny," said Tinky, annoyed.
<br><br>
	"Heartwood, can she just be a - my half-sister.  I mean, I don't want to be rude or anything, but the only way I'm connected to her is that my mom helped tutor her.  Well, you know.  She's just - Tinky's just - um -"  he started to stutter.
<br><br>
	Heartwood shook his head.  "I don't think that's an appropriate term for someone so similar to you."
<br><br>
	<em>Similar?</em> Neren raged.
<br><br>
	"Besides, saying 'half' makes it sound like you're a Half Elf.  I don't mean to be rude or anything, but to several, Half Elves are a disgrace to Norrath.  That's why isn't proper for Elves to call each other half-brother or half-sister, not just for social reasons, but also for protection.  Although I despise this, it's a fact for all Half Elves."  Heartwood glanced meaningfully at Renidyen who was still laughing.  Heartwood paused, staring at both Neren and Tinky.  "You should get along just fine."  He closed his eyes and murmured, "Tunare, bless the pair of you."  He performed a short ritual.
<br><br>
	In the background Renidyen was finally forced to control himself after almost suffocating.  Gilerrin was still surprised.
<br><br>
	"Do I have to?  Tunare, I was never meant for this," Neren muttered under his breath.
<br><br>
	Unfortunately for him, the Heartwood Master had heard him.  "Yes, you have to.  Tunare has already agreed with me, and I've charged you with the duty… if you can call that a duty.  And Neren, just a simple question, don't you feel sorry for her… even for the least bit?"
<br><br>
	<em>No!</em>  Neren paused for a moment, then sighed.  <em>And yes.</em>
<br><br>
	"What?" a confused Tinky asked.
<br><br>
	"Never mind," said Neren.  "Gilerrin -"
<br><br>
	"What?  Oh, congratulations."
<br><br>
	"Wha…?  Gilerrin?  What do you think this is?"
<br><br>
	Gilerrin scratched his head.  "Sorry."  He grinned.  "Wasn't thinking."
<br><br>
	"This isn't a wedding," said Heartwood.
<br><br>
	Neren heard Renidyen's barely audible voice say, "If only it were."  Renidyen began chuckling again.
<br><br>
	"You're sick," said Neren.
<br><br>
	Chrysia looked at him again in puzzlement.  Neren found it uncomfortable to look down on people; he was always looking straight at or up at a person's head.  He averted his head, quickly muttering, "Never mind."
<br><br>
	Heartwood, satisfied, felt it was best to leave the youths alone for the while and walked over to his table.  His sewing was audible in the background.
<br><br>
	<em>How fast moods change here - from anxiety, grief, anger, happiness…and so many others…</em> Neren thought.  <em>…and now, back to these dark emotions.</em>  Neren grimaced.  <em>This is just perfect.  Tunare, at least you should schedule a bit more evenly.  That day I become a druid, and now today?  At the point in which Kelethin, my home, is about to fall?!  And I never wanted Tinky; she's damn annoying.  Heartwood has just charged me to be her brother, but if she's always like this, I'll be more of a father than a brother.  Tunare!  Neren, control yourself!  Cursing at Tunare won't do anything.  Besides, do you think your day has been that bad?  What about Tinky?  She's lost both of her parents today… permanently - damn that Banisher! - and she's had the courage and discipline to nerve herself into a relatively happy mood.  For this, I think of her as a baby?  Tunare, she's even braver than I am; she held her tears until now, acted calm and carefree, trying to let the future change her view of her past…  And all I show is disgust?!  I show no care at all?!  She's my sister, accept that damn fact!</em>  Neren sighed.  <em>I can't accept her though; it's just not natural.  She's not my sister!  Heartwood has no right to do this!  But, I also need to think about others…  Tunare, I'm being so selfish!  Okay, she is my sister, I accept it, but not by heart.</em>  But Neren sympathized for her deeply.  <em>She was brave, I admit that.  She has no hint of evil - purely innocent.  Yes, she's beautiful, but I really don't see much point to that.  Why are older people so different?  They only notice each other's bodies!  But Chrysia…I called her Chrysia!  I must be getting used to this.</em>  Neren sighed again.  <em>Think of your father, Neren.  Think of Natures Word.  What would he do?</em>  At the memory of his father, he commenced to stare at the floor, avoiding eye contact with the others to hide his feelings.
<br><br>
	However, Gilerrin saw Neren's troubled expression.  He nudged Renidyen and told him to shush.  Meanwhile Heartwood left his seat and departed from the building, muttering something incomprehensible, but Gilerrin caught a sharp glance from him.  That was enough to tell him not to interfere with Neren and Tinky.
<br><br>
	Suddenly, Neren lifted his head toward Tinky and said, "I'm sorry, Chrysia… Chrysia, I'm so sorry.  You've suffered much more than I have; I… I had no right to express dislike toward you.  I acted like a jerk!  Do you forgive me, Chrysia… sister?"
<br><br>
	Tinky was speechless.  It was the first time Neren had called her true name, and Neren actually expressed his feelings to her!  She felt a mixture of awkwardness and happiness, more of the former.  But she enjoyed the warmth of Neren's body when Neren embraced her again, this time wholeheartedly.  "I'm sorry," Neren quietly repeated over and over again.
<br><br>
	The words weren't just directed toward Tinky, they had a hint of prayer to them, and Gilerrin realized that Neren was also apologizing to Tunare and his father's lost soul.  <em>For what?</em> he thought.  It didn't really matter.  He saw Neren's eyes were closed, with tears on the verge of revealing themselves.  Amazingly, Renidyen wasn't laughing, but muttering curses at himself for being such an idiot earlier.  <em>About time…</em> Gilerrin thought.
<br><br>
	Unexpectedly, the doors banged open, and Blossom walked in, wearing human-sized ranger armor, which seemed a tad too small for her.  She must've grown even in her coma, Gilerrin realized.  Her eyes wandered around the room looking for Heartwood, until they settled on the figure of Neren and Tinky.  Her lips transformed into a grin.  "Well, now I've seen it - two toddlers in love."
<br><br>
	"What, you've never seen love before?" Heartwood's disgusted voice behind Blossom made her jump.
<br><br>
	"Well, actually, not really this -"
<br><br>
	"And anyway, they aren't in love - they're too young to understand it well, and… um, well, it's complicated."
<br><br>
	Neren disengaged from Tinky and looked at the rest.  Tinky's eyes followed his in a combination of surprise, despair, and understanding.
<br><br>
	"Come on, let's get to work," Neren said, not feeling embarrassed at all.
<br><br>
	Again, he stared at Heartwood for a while, almost begging but with a different question in heart, but Heartwood responded with stony eyes that said he would not budge in his decision to stay in Kelethin.
<br><br>
	After several minutes of conversation, footsteps were heard, and Trueshot entered, carrying several sacks filled with fresh food and water.  Heartwood commenced in adding finishing touches to his backpacks, then handed them over to Blossom, who in turn, along with a belt pouch, distributed them among the rest.  Heartwood quietly asked Trueshot where the other adult went and the ranger replied he had gone out to help the defenders.
<br><br>
	"Oh, Neren," said Tinky.  "Here's your compass, I've fixed it."
<br><br>
	"So fast?"
<br><br>
	"What did you expect from a tinkering master?"
<br><br>
	"You haven't mastered it yet, you braggart," Gilerrin said with a laugh.
<br><br>
	"Oh?  I'll teach you all about making gadgets on the trip.  Do you want to see how to create a telescope?"
<br><br>
	"You can't make armor by tinkering," Gilerrin grinned.
<br><br>
	"I can make lanterns which can be just as useful…"
<br><br>
	"But we already have lightstones," Gilerrin countered.
<br><br>
	"…and what do you know about trade skills?"
<br><br>
	"Um… I don't think 'tinkering' has anything to do with the current issue," interrupted Renidyen.  "Now, discussing our route would be useful… Neren, to Butcherblock or Ak'Anon?"
<br><br>
	"Not many Gnomes are at Ak'Anon right now, and we need to leave Faydwer - Butcherblock it is."
<br><br>
	Heartwood was busy talking to Maesyn's father, so Neren's party of travelers was left alone.
<br><br>
	"Hey, what about Duror and Luegwen?" said Gilerrin abruptly.
<br><br>
	"We can't wait for them, if they are coming at all… and explaining my dream to all of Kelethin will take too much time; better to at least save ourselves instead of dying with the others."  Neren chucked his compass into his backpack.  "Alright, I'm all packed.  Everyone ready?" asked Neren.
<br><br>
	"Almost.  Wait a second."  Gilerrin strapped his scabbard to his side, tested his bowstring quickly, and fastened his bow onto a little loop on his backpack, making sure it was easily accessible.  "Ready.  Now let's start -"
<br><br>
	"Shh!  Listen!" said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	Someone was shouting, ordering for everyone to retreat back to Kelethin.  Amidst the resulting confusion, a messenger arrived at their door and explained briefly that the Minotaurs and Goblins had laid a trap for the defenders.  Undead were also spotted around the area.  Heartwood and Trueshot lurched to their feet and ran out to investigate.  Gilerrin blinked his eyes in surprise.  Neren's dream was true!  <em>Wait, didn't I already believe in it?</em>  Gilerrin shook his head.
<br><br>
	"This is it," said Neren.  "I remember now.  In minutes Kelethin will be surrounded.  Then Felwithe falls under dark magic.  Those tunnels will be collapsed… the route to the Lesser Faydark will be blocked… and Kelethin will fall when…"  Neren's eyes widened.  "We have to leave <em>now</em>!"
<br><br>
	The rest recognized Neren's urgency and immediately scrambled to do their final preparations.  Renidyen grabbed his backpack and was the first to leave.  The rest followed.  Tinky was smaller than the rest, so Blossom had to hold her hand and pull her.
<br><br>
	"Come on!" shouted Renidyen.  He paused for a moment to let the others catch up.
<br><br>
	Neren located his compass.  "Wait, follow me.  We need to head southeast to the Butcherblock Mounts.  Renidyen's going the right way, but I know of a shortcut."
<br><br>
	They passed the bank on the way.  The building was filled with activity.  The magical vault was activated to accomplish its special ability: to teleport it's contents to any other bank on the face of Norrath.  <em>If only they could teleport all of Kelethin like that…</em> Neren thought.  Neren had no time to watch the spectacle though.  He checked the time.
<br><br>
	"Only a couple minutes left," he said.
<br><br>
	The travelers redoubled their efforts and finally reached the platform closest to Butcherblock.  Blossom opened her backpack and took out her grappling hook and rope.  She threw its head down so that the hooks would sink deeper into the wood and unrolled the rest of the rope to the ground.  It was long by several meters, so there was no worry of having to tie ropes together.  The others agreed to let Blossom go down first since she was the strongest and was able to hold the rope the tightest.  Blossom tested the rope, then, satisfied, half-slid and -climbed down to the ground.  Only her gloves spared her hands from burns.  Tinky went next, and she made it to the ground with some difficulty, but Blossom held the rope tight.  The rest slipped down easily.  Blossom recovered her rope with the help of one of Tinky's gadgets.
<br><br>
	They slipped away, hidden by Greater Faydark's trees.  Only Tinky had trouble since she was neither druid nor ranger, but a soon-to-be bard.  The little Wood Elf had admired Neren's mother and Llienna so much, that she had vowed to be one.  Although Llienna tried to dissuade her, explaining that there were other classes available, but Tinky would not budge.  In addition to her familiarity with the class, she did possess a naturally strong and clear voice and the ability to converge melodies beautifully.
<br><br>
	Neren held his sister's hand, and helped her through many obstacles.  Once, her tunic got caught by a thorny bush.  Blossom, in the process of  unlatching the hook-like thorns from Tinky, realized the plant's potential.  She grabbed a handful of dirt near the bush and filled an empty flask with it.  Neren didn't bother to ask, but Gilerrin knew what Blossom had in mind.  He also quickly scooped up some dirt and skillfully broke off some thorns.  The party of adventurers went on.
<br><br>
	"Neren!  Watch -" shouted Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	Neren ducked, and an arrow sliced through where his head was a split second ago.  At once, both Blossom and Gilerrin unlatched their bows while Neren prepared one of his axes.  All three projectiles struck true.
<br><br>
	Just as Gilerrin was recovering the weapons for Blossom, Neren, and himself, Renidyen shouted, "Tinky, get out of there!  Watch out!"
<br><br>
	As Tinky turned around to see, she tripped on a root and was sent sprawling to the ground.  An incoming Gnoll, leaped up with its glinting sword raised high.  Gilerrin tossed Neren his axe, which the druid caught skillfully and immediately threw.  The weapon struck home.  But the Gnoll's inertia kept him in the air, just above Tinky.
<br><br>
	"Tinky!" shouted Neren, diving toward her.
<br><br>
	Tinky screamed.  Neren threw his other axe in midair, striking the Gnoll's weapon out of its hand.  It fell dead, lying next to Tinky.
<br><br>
	Already other enemies were arriving.
<br><br>
	"They're flanking us," said Renidyen, taking battle stance.
<br><br>
	"Neren, I'm stuck!" shouted Tinky.  Her legs were tangled in a web of green vines.  <em>Snare, damn spell,</em> thought Neren.  <em>What luck.</em>
<br><br>
	Neren grabbed his axes and held his position to protect her.  Behind him, Gilerrin was firing arrow after arrow, and to his left, Renidyen was hacking away the undead, namely skeletons, which was his specialty.  Blossom had disappeared, but every now and then, an Orc's corpse appeared out of nowhere.
<br><br>
	While Neren was battling a goblin, Tinky screamed again, more softly this time.  Neren ducked under a fist and slew Tinky's assailant with a quick slice.  Then he thrust upward, fatally injuring the goblin.
<br><br>
	Finally, Tinky managed to free herself, but not totally unscathed.  Her body was covered by tiny cuts and bruises.  Helping her up, Neren pulled her out of the area.
<br><br>
	"She's freed, let's go!" he shouted.  Then, quietly to Tinky, "Don't scream next time, okay?  It'll attract attention."
<br><br>
	Tinky was almost too afraid to cry, but she managed to say, "I'm not used to battle…  Hey, what are you doing?  Ouch!"  Neren was inspecting a large cut on her arm.
<br><br>
	He healed her and beckoned for the others to follow him.  Although Renidyen was a Paladin, his familiarity with the Greater Faydark and his experiences from his travels earned him an adequate skill of trekking through the forest.  He jumped up and grabbed a branch.  Kicking two skeletons away, he dropped, turned, and followed Neren.
<br><br>
	The pursuers relentlessly pursued them.  Because they all knew nature very well, the party had no trouble in keeping their distance from their clumsy adversaries.  Every now and then, a Teir'Dal caster threw a fireball or an archer launched an arrow at them.  They were making good progress until a magical bolt hit Gilerrin in the back.  Neren and Blossom stopped and helped him up as swiftly as possible.  However, the delay cost them.  Neren was forced to kill one of the faster Gnolls before they could depart again.  This in turn, allowed more of the Dark Elves' minions to catch them.
<br><br>
	Then Tinky's luck collapsed.  The hapless Elf, unprotected because Neren was busy fighting off the enemy, was caught by an arrow that pierced her chest.  Neren heard her cry and immediately ran as fast as possible to save her.  But it was too late; a sword flashed and the resulting scream was enough to tell Neren what had happened.
<br><br>
	"Chrysia!"
<br><br>
	"Neren, wait!  Come back!" shouted Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	However, Neren's eyes were already glazed over with bloodlust.  With a roar, he dove into the mob nearest Tinky's body.  Gilerrin and Renidyen looked at each other for a second, and with a nod, they rushed to aid Neren.  Blossom muttered a quick curse and followed Gilerrin and Renidyen.
<br><br>
	Several other Gnolls and Orcs were hacking away at Tinky's body.  Each hit only spurred Neren's energy.  When Neren reached Tinky and saw her pitiful form, his warrior spirit overpowered him.  With a roar, he attacked his foes by blinding the air in front of them with swings of his weapons.  The air was filled with axes and blood and the occasional bone from a skeleton was flung into the sky.  The Goblins stayed behind and watched, being the cowards they were while the mindless undead were instantly slaughtered once they were in range of Neren's weapons.  Neren's injuries mounted, but his warrior blood was already boiling with anger, and his body would not let him feel pain; he seemed unstoppable.  He struck ever harder and harder, and soon even the stupid Orcs became wary.  Gilerrin and Renidyen charged through, saying to Neren, "Check on Tinky, we'll handle."  Neren almost protested, but common sense and overwhelming concern forced his mind to return.
<br><br>
	A few seconds later, his eyes normal, Neren crawled over to Tinky's body with a heavy heart.  He didn't even want to look at her.  Her body was punctured by a broken arrow, an axe was protruding from her shoulder, and a long blood-red stripe indicated where the sword hit her. The wounds inflicted upon her formed a crisscross pattern.  Blood was splattered all over the rest of her clothing, informing Neren of yet other injuries.  Her eyes closed, she seemed dead.  Neren's eyes narrowed.  <em>Did she move?  Tunare, please tell she did…  She's breathing!</em>  He laid his hand on her chest and was rewarded with slight movement.
<br><br>
	When he pulled the axe out, Tinky gasped.  "Neren…"
<br><br>
	"It'll be alright," soothed Neren, his eyes locked onto her body.  He glanced at Gilerrin and Renidyen who were successfully beating off the evil creatures at the moment.
<br><br>
	Neren's attention returned to Tinky.  She seemed just like another corpse.  To Neren, it was a miracle that she was actually alive.  He took off her backpack, adjusting his position so he could carry both Tinky's and his backpacks.  She wasn't moving anymore, but casting healing spells in the middle of a losing fight wasn't a very good idea.  After putting away his axes, Neren, gingerly lifted her body off the ground.
<br><br>
	"She's alive!  Retreat!" he shouted.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin and Renidyen renewed their effort after they heard this.  Slowly backing away, they searched for the chance to flee in vain.  They were hard pressed, and more Orcs, Gnolls, and Goblins were arriving by the second.  Then Blossom arrived like a thunderbolt.  With her expertise, she held them off long enough for the rest to jump out of the battle.  After pushing them back with her swords, she murmured a spell that summoned a bolt of lightning to strike her opponents.  Then she turned and fled.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">

	"Will she live?" asked Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	Tinky lay on the ground under Renidyen's cloak.  Blossom had previously undressed her and reported all her wounds to Neren.
<br><br>
	"She's suffered so many serious injuries, so I can't totally heal her.  All I can do is keep her alive.  But I'm not letting any of us die here.  Tunare, I will not let her die!" said Neren.
<br><br>
	Tinky stopped moving suddenly.  Neren, alarmed, cast his healing spell on her and was relieved to find her still alive, then sat down to meditate.  He gently stroked her head, avoiding a forming scar that stretched from her forehead to lower right jaw.  <em>Heartwood was right.  She </em>is <em>like me.  If only if I could tell her that I do care for her… that inside, I've finally accepted her as my sister.</em>  He could feel himself bonding with his new sister.  Now, Gilerrin and Renidyen understood his feelings.  It wasn't passionate love, though it was a certain type of love - the love of family.  Gilerrin realized that Neren's loneliness was satisfied by Tinky's presence while Tinky's grief was filled by Neren.
<br><br>
	"Blossom, any signs of our pursuers?" said Renidyen, behind Neren.
<br><br>
	"No.  By now, they've either given up or passed us.  I'm bargaining for the former."
<br><br>
	"Aye," said Gilerrin.  "Oh, Neren, cast your spell again.  She's stopped moving."
<br><br>
	At once, Neren stood up and cast his healing spell on Tinky.  He sat down to meditate.
<br><br>
	"If only I had a stronger heal spell," sighed Neren.
<br><br>
	"I have the same spell you do, you know," said Blossom.
<br><br>
	"But it's much weaker compared to mine.  I'm a druid of Tunare!"
<br><br>
	"Tunare, please just revive her," Gilerrin exasperated.  Then to Neren, "She's important, but we're wasting valuable time.  Neren, according to your dream, has Kelethin already fallen?"
<br><br>
	"In another twenty minutes," Renidyen responded for him.
<br><br>
	"That gives us about three-quarters of an hour from now to start moving again," said Blossom.
<br><br>
	"No, remember that they would go to Castle Mistmoore to celebrate?  That gives us at least half the day," said Neren.
<br><br>
	"Neren, she's slipping again," said Gilerrin, yawning.
<br><br>
	Neren pinpointed which part of Tinky's body was failing and healed her.
<br><br>
	"Why were you collecting the soil and thorns?" Neren asked, before sitting down again.
<br><br>
	"They make good arrowheads.  The soil contained seeds of that thorny bush.  You do have a spell that accelerates growth, right?"
<br><br>
	"Um… let me check."
<br><br>
	Neren reviewed his spellbook.  "Found it.  It'll take nearly all my mana to cast it though."
<br><br>
	"You won't need to cast it often."
<br><br>
	"Okay.  Now let me meditate.  I can't let her die here; the Banisher's influence is vast."
<br><br>
	"Don't meditate just yet, she's stopped moving again."
<br><br>
	Blue, sparkling magic settled on Tinky's body, and soon she was stirring again.
<br><br>
	"I'm going to take a nap.  Neren, can you keep doing this without rest?" said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	Neren sighed again, then yawned.  "Who knows?  Only Tunare does…"
