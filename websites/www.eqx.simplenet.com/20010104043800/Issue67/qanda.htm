<B>Please Note:</B> EverQuest Express is not the official voice of Verant
Interactive, makers of EverQuest.  We cannot answer questions about payment 
methods, hardware requirements (i.e. video cards), or technical details about 
the game.  This Q&A is meant to cover gameplay issues only.  Thank you for 
understanding.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've purchased EverQuest, but I am unable to play it do to my computer falling under the minimum requirements. I tried, but it was unbearable. I will be buying a new computer in around 2 months. My question is whether or not I will be able to still enjoy EverQuest; having not got in on the "ground level" of the game? Between the beta phases and these months I missed, some people will have been playing a year. Do you feel there will still be enough "new" people coming in then to form parties,etc.. Will there have been major events that I'll have missed for the worst?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter when someone purchases the game, they will be able to enjoy the game.  Throughout beta there was never a shortage of low level characters in the game.  Now in release, we will continue to see new characters being created all the time as more people buy the game, and existing players create new characters.  There is always a group of powergamers who play one character from level 1 to 50.  There is another group of players who wish to experience different settings and play a variety of characters, and these players will continue to make new ones. You may well miss out on a major event or two, but you wont be the only one, and there will continue to be more of these as time goes on.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the arrangement of the stars, sun, and moon have anything to do with the game, or are they just there?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;They are there for cosmetics only.  Of course, without the sun in the sky, it would always be night, so I guess you could say that has a significant effect on the game. 

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I train a point in, say, blacksmithing, and I gain a level, do I get more free training in that skill?  What if I don't train in that skill?  Will my maximum skill level be affected?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your skill maximum is not dependent upon your current skill level or how many training sessions you have put into it.  As you gain levels, your maximum will increase regardless of whether or not you have ever used the skill.  The cost of training depends on your current skill level.  If you train the basics and practice your way up to, say skill level 50, you will be required to pay cash for your next training session in that skill.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there always be a chance to die using the begging skill?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time your skill fails, you have the chance of upsetting your target.  Doing so could endanger your life.  Beg at your own risk.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a specific skill you can learn that will increase the amount of hitpoints or mana points as you level? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No.  The amount of increase is only dependent upon your stats, which can never permanently increase.  You are better off searching for magical items that can give you a boost in these areas, and grouping with spell casters who can magically increase your hitpoints.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have two characters on a server and one is a necromancer and the other is a rogue.  I was wondering if I could put stuff in a box and drop it on the ground, then start my other character and find the box to recover the stuff. 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes this is possible.  However, items dropped on the ground have a relatively short lifespan, so they may decay before you retrieve them.  Also, any passing player could pick up your items and you would be none the wiser.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just out of curiosity, do you actually have to click the License agreement every time you start the game? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no known way to bypass the license agreement.  With the inevitable problems arising when you gather thousands of people online, it may be good to remind people each time they enter the game, that they agree to be bound by a standard set of rules.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;EverQuest is the finest game I have seen in years! My question is why they don't they find an ISP of the same quality as the game.  UUNET is making a farce out of the game and embarrassing me, as I raved about EQ so much in beta 4 that I influence 10 friends to buy the game. Now they all think I lied. 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As you have all likely discovered by the time you read this, the network connection to the EverQuest servers has been improved significantly.  UUNet has added additional capacity to accommodate a huge increase in traffic, which is allowing EQ to open its doors once again.  To compensate players for this bothersome annoyance, they have extended the free time period an extra two weeks for those players who have registered  during this disturbance.  This is actually good news for us customers, as it shows that Verant strives to correct major problems that arise, while also striving to keep us all happy despite these problems.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, ok...the calendar was very amusing.  But, um, WHERE ARE THE MEN?????
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;We in no way meant to exclude our female readers (or anybody else attracted to men) from enjoying the pleasurable sights of Norrath.  The majority of players are males who ogle, hit on, harass, and get slapped by anything with boobs. (Don't deny it.)  As such, we decided to focus on the girls of Norrath as our first calendar.  We will investigate the possibility of creating a calendar to cater to other tastes as well.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be unique Shadowknight weapons just like the unique Paladin weapons?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be unique items available for each class.

<BR><BR>

<B>Corrections:</B><BR>
As of phase 4, Bind Affinity no longer required the target to click yes or no to accept the bind.  Apparently being in a group is security enough.
