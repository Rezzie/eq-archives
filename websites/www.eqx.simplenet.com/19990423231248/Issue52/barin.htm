	Barin was a dwarf warrior of the Devlar who fought in the wars against the dark elves.  He was generally an unremarkable individual, except for his desire to eventually found his own mine after he had finished fighting the dark elves.  He wished to start his mining in a new mountain range, away from the current delvings that existed.   Of course, such an endeavor requires clan members to believe in the talent or funding of a particular individual, and Barin, as far as he knew, didn't have either… yet.
<br><br>
	During one of the battles he fought in, Barin found himself in a forge used by the dark elves.  It was empty, yet the forge fire was burning hotly, something which usually requires bellows and hard work to maintain.  As he walked over to the fire, he wondered how this could be, because as far as he knew, an unattended fire would cool considerably.  The sounds of battle fading as the dwarf army cleared the dark elf home, Barin looked into the fire. And the fire looked back!
<br><br>
	Startled, Barin stepped back in surprise.  He looked a second time, more carefully, and saw a face in the white-hot flames.
<br><br>
	"Wh-what are you," Barin asked.
<br><br>
	"I am a salamander, chained here by the dark ones, and used to heat the metal of their weapons," said the face. "My name is Fuorik."
<br><br>
	"We dwarves never do this, do we?" asked Barin.  "I've never seen such a thing before.  How long have you been here?"
<br><br>
	"Dwarves have never chained any of my brethren, although you would think they would.  I have been here for many years.  Can you free me?"
<br><br>
	"What will you do when free?  There are many dwarves down here and I would not like myself or them harmed", warned Barin.
<br><br>
	"I will burn only the dark ones that stand in my way to home," promised Fuorik  "Undo that brass latch, which has been magicked against me, and my spirit will be released from it's confines."
<br><br>
	Barin went over to a large brass latch which had a steel chain forged through it.  Examining the metal he found it was typical elf steel, not has strong as his axe.  He smote it a mighty blow, shattering the chain links, which he then pulled through the latch.  
<br><br>
	At this the salamander burst free, his flames burned even hotter.  Fuorik danced about the room, caroming off the walls and ceiling like a ball bouncing in a confined space. "I'm free, I'm free!" he roared. "You and your kin can call upon me when needed, dwarf, and I will be there!"  With that, Fuorik roared through the wall on his way to his home, burning earth, rock, and elf until he was free.  The chaos that ensued amongst the dark elves at his release guaranteed victory for the dwarf army, as the salamander burned those who had chained him - who also happened to be the magic using dark elves of the highest power.
<br><br>
	After the war had ended Barin went back to the trade of the Devlar and mined, learning the lore of the earth and eventually became the foreman of a work crew.  He had never spoken to anyone about the salamander, since he was afraid no one would believe him and that they might think he was boasting about his place in the battle.  He still dreamed, however, about having a mine of his own.
<br><br>
	His off days he would spend roaming the Butcherblock Mountains, far from Kaladim.  Taking soil and rock samples, he would examine them at night by lantern-light, but he could not find a rich source, nor indications of one anywhere.  His ramblings took him farther and farther from Kaladim, and closer to Dagnor's Cauldron.  One day he traveled so far that he realized he would have to camp near the Cauldron overnight.  Soaked and chilled by the rain and stiff winds in the Cauldron, he sought a cave in a nearby mountain face.
<br><br>
	Removing his flint and tinder from his pack, he realized with disappointment that his tinder was soaked through.	There was no dry wood in the cave, and outside the storm was gathering strength.  He took the tinder out to dry on his lantern while he went outside to gather some wood to fuel a fire.  He'd have to dry that too, he grumbled to himself.
<br><br>
	He gathered wood from outside the cave, trying to find sheltered bits of wood but having little success.  As he brought his load of damp wood into the cave, a rivulet of water spilled off a wet leaf and soaked his then-dry tinder.
<br><br>
	"By Brell's brass teeth!", he cursed, "What do I have to do to get a little fire!" He sat down heavily on a nearby rock and put his head in his hands. He shivered, and hugged himself for warmth.
<br><br>
	Faintly, almost imperceptibly he heard a low hissing sort of rumble.  He thought at first it was the storm increasing power, but as it increased, it seemed to come from the back end of the cave.  Curious and a little worried that he hadn't checked deeply enough into the cave, Barin walked towards it, holding his lantern high to looked back towards the end of the cave.
<br><br>
	"Hmph.  Blank wall", he said to himself, going back to the rock he was sitting on.  His lantern went out.
<br><br>
	"Brell curse you and all your kind!" he raged uselessly at the lantern, kicking it. "I need FIRE!"
<br><br>
	The room was filled with a hissing roar.  Bursting out from the end of the cave came a raging inferno that coalesced into a vaguely man-like shape.
<br><br>
	"You called?" asked Fuorik.
<br><br>
	The cave crackled as the rock walls began to heat.  Barin's damp clothes began to steam slightly. Suddenly, Barin's problem was not too little heat, but too much!
<br><br>
	"Fuorik!  Can… can you tone it down a little bit?"  Barin shouted over the creaks and groans of expanding rock.
<br><br>
	Fuorik dimmed a bit, and the cave became tolerable.
<br><br>
	"What do you want of me, dwarf?" Fuorik boomed.
<br><br>
	Barin had forgotten about the salamanders promise. "I, just wanted to get warm… I was out here prospecting, and the storm drove me in here.  I didn't mean for you to come."
<br><br>
	Flames cascaded up and down the serpentine figure. "Prospecting? What's that?"
<br><br>
	"I'm looking for a new mine, one of my own."
<br><br>
	"A mine?  What metal?" asked the flaming figure.
<br><br>
	"A valuable one, like gold, or a useful one, like high-grade iron ore," replied Barin.  "I've been searching for weeks."
<br><br>
	Licks of flame flickered up and down the salamander.  Barin waited, wondering what Fuorik was thinking, or doing.  
<br><br>
	The salamander reached out towards Barin. Barin shied away, the heat from the figure making him frightened to touch it. "Here, this is for you.  I no longer am bound to you, for I have fulfilled your wish."
<br><br>
	In his hand, or paw was a glowing red circle of metal.  Barin touched it and screamed as it's scorching heat burned his hands.  It dropped to the ground.
<br><br>
	"You must wear it at once, or it will forever lose it's power." With that, Fuorik exited, a rush of hot air the only sign he had been there.
<br><br>
	Barin reached down and, wincing with pain, put the ring on his finger.  As he slid it over his knuckles, his finger burned black from the heat of it, until finally it rested, sizzling at the base of his finger.  As it cooled, he found that he was unable to remove it.
<br><br>
	The next day Barin discovered that the ring grew warm around metal, and used it to find a rich vein of gold-bearing quartz.  With that mine, he made his fortune, and brought much renown to his clan.
<br><br>
	He and his kin forever bore the name of Blackfinger.
