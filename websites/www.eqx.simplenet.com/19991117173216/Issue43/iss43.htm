Brammin sat up sharply, and glanced at his surroundings. The mysterious room he was in soon laid down an air of recognition. He stood up and glanced out the window. The magnificent rooftops of the high city of Erudin sprouted upwards, vying for their positions in the bright sky. The shallow sun floated merrily above the city, streaking warmth and providing light.

There were things to be said about being a research assistant for Morloth.  Unfortunately none of these things were good.
<br><br>
Truth was, if she had her way, Nulcea would be working for someone with more vision and less inertia.  Someone with a need to travel, not to stay behind a desk.  Someone who could keep his hands to himself.

<em>'... for knowledge is the greatest quest of all.'</em>
<br><br>
Well, Erud was close.  Once you've found love, then, I suppose, knowledge is the greatest quest of all.
<br><br>
But then you can't always be seeking love.  Sometimes you have to just chance upon it.

The air was still damp from the mist that blew relentlessly inland from the coast.   Pas glanced up at the lightening sky and dreaded the day to come.  Another night spent researching relentlessly only to be rewarded with tired eyes and cramped muscles. Her master, Cork, would want to drill endlessly on the dry topic of rune etymologies as he had every third day for the last two years.  It seemed to be a never-ending topic and unfortunately one of his favorites.

Well it's been a while since I prattled about PC games.  I'm ready to report on a few of the latest games I've been playing.  If you're bored and want something to spice up your PC, go check these out!

<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
Damp, salty circles formed on the cracked earth. A short cry was heard, causing twenty birds to flap away from their rest on a scorched tree. An ant paused, sensing the drops tiny vibrations, and scurried of north; leaving it's invisible enemy behind.... Colour was then added, bringing a red hue to the wet circles, giving them the unknown feeling of their creator. The red dripped from another source, it was the cause of sorrow and the taint of internal damnation. The clear, but poisoned drops were the reflection of sorrow and regret; come too late to hold any salvation. What was done was done, the needless waste had passed; only the scar on nature told the story.

Tomorrow begins another campaign.  That means that tonight begins another character.
<br><br>
The trouble with making up first level characters is that they are all fresh.  None of them has any, or much, previous experience.  They can't know anything, they can't have a past.  This can be a dilemma at times.

<em>I thought it was really cool that the screen shot of the Erudin library
was bestowed to the greatest literary work in EQ site realm.   I wonder
if it was purely by chance or if Brad did it on purpose.  I found it
very appropriate.  I've been reading your paper for about 10 issues now,
but just this week went back and read every article (as opposed to
tales) from Issue 1 to the present.  Because you site isn't current
event based, the old articles weren't stale and were just as enjoyable
as the new ones.  I would encourage all readers who haven't been with
you since the beginning to do the same.  I think your newspaper is
awesome; keep up the good work.

This week we have the answers for Issue 41.  It has become increasingly difficult to 
find new information for EXaminer.  Hopefully someone at 989 will release a bunch of 
new information for us.
