	Set into the cliffs and trees of the Greater Faydark, Felwithe is a Capitol of all that is Elven and Magical in Norrath. Here dwell the Noble Elves, children of Tunare and wisest of the races in Norrath. In this beautiful City can be found a variety of professions and skills, and some of the leading masters of thought. Here are bred some of the finest spell-casters, zealous Paladins and holy clerics Norrath has to offer. In this is also one of the best opportunities for the patient role-player to shine.
<br><br>
	High Elves are the only race cleansed of nearly all impurity religiously and professionally, with the exception of the oft-forgetful Wizard followers of the God of Fire. All other races possess some underground religious following to a God such as Bertoxxulous or Cazic-Thule, but even Bristlebane cannot touch the Children of Tunare here. They have no warriors, no rogues, and no splinter factions. Felwithe could be likened to a High-class University or Temple in that they all seem to be closely bound to the same goals and mannerisms. It is possible that there is no room at all for deviants in the culture, although anyone who visits the Faydark killing fields will see many a sailor-mouthed High Elf wrestling in the mud over slimy spider eyes. Where do these deviants fit into the society? Surely they would not but we can still find value in the intellectually challenged around us. At very least they could make us look like better men, no?
<br><br>
	The Noble children of Tunare possess a charisma like none to be found anywhere else in Norrath. With a little persistence a High Elf Player can make himself loved in any decent culture. Mechanically this creates a hidden role for High Elves as excellent negotiators for merchant dealings and some quests. Because a High Elf can buy products for often several platinum less than the average warrior or homely gnome magician, there comes a time when everyone wants a High Elf around, or wishes they were one. In addition to this, their high Intelligence makes them excellent at learning trades in addition to their high-powered spells. When I start to think of how this would translate into a real-world society or culture my mind conjures images of a city-sized shopping complex, rather than some high-class university. However with some further thought, it starts to make more sense and in this we can find some interesting roles to play.
<br><br>
	Consider your neighbors, the creative Gnomes, warrior-children Elves and Dwarven Crafts-makers.  Through research at vast libraries of both Felwithe and Ak'Anon both magic and mundane items and weapons have been reinvented. Here on Faydwer the collection of demihumans would have collaborated on many a project and accomplishment. Imagine instead of a Shopping center a distributed center for research full of laboratories and libraries. Here were invented items such as the advanced composite bow and crossbow, the spyglass, numerous Gnomish machines as well as lighter and more efficient armor and weapons. In this sub-society High Elves might be your upper management, project founders and leads of research throughout Norrath. Of course this would be only a small fraction of the populace, and your role need not be confined to that of your trades-proficient brethren. 
<br><br>
	For the crusading children of Tunare, the mighty Paladins and fair spell-casters who choose nothing else but to strike at the heart of evil, there also lie great opportunities to role-play. They are our Noble warrior-scholars defending the way of the less fortunate, and those who do not know any better. A High Elf should not scoff at the Human men and women who walk down self-destructive paths, but seek instead to educate them of the follies of civilization past. If any race were to remember the mistakes of the lost civilizations that walked away from the Gods, it would be High Elves. Of these mistakes, the High Elves should have learned the pitfalls of meaningless Crusading in the name of a false cause.
<br><br>
	It does not seem right that the followers of Tunare would leave home to join the front ranks of war against men or barbarians, as the Mother of All seemingly would oppose all war except that to preserve peace, not enforce it. Question yourself of the nobility of a violent act, and wonder why your character would desire to "toss the glove down" and engage a human rogue on the street, or pick a fight with a barbarian because you know others who have hunted sacred bears. Racial hatred seems something that would be alien to High Elves, with the exception of Dark Elves, Ogres and Trolls, which themselves are alien to the way of Tunare. Of course, those that ally against the light such as the BloodSabres of Qeynos would not find the same loving forgiveness at the end of your High Elves blade. Even so, would you really want to hunt the whole of them down and slaughter them in the name of a Noble Cause?
<br><br>
	Classic Elves would not meddle in the affairs of men until a time of great crisis, and when they did come out of their forest they still were the presence of Nobility, and never the front line warriors. The Cousin Elves of Kelethin are much more suited for bloody messy combat, and everyone has their place. As a noble you lead by example, and as a good role player you can help encourage others to role-play and enjoy it.  Go forth now and take your place, have fun and make friends.
