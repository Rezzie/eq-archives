Well, I took a few weeks off EverQuest and EQX.  I had a big run with Posy and sort of hit a rut, taking her from 6th to 28th and then kind of flaming out.  Today I logged in for the first time in ages, and started where I left off, fighting out by the Split Paw Teeth again.  Now, some of my previous friends were a few levels higher than I was, so I couldn't group with them, but I found a group right away and got half a level in about 4 hours.  It was as if I had never left.
<br><br>
That's a bit sad.  Thirty days outside the game and I plugged right back in.  We don't really get that feeling of big changes, do we?  In Absor's last editorial he touched on something really important - let me quote him - "Is EverQuest patched? Well sure. Is EverQuest changed? Sure. Is EverQuest evolving? Well, no."   I came back after a month away, and nothing was different.  Sure, there were some class tweaks. Someone had found the Fiery Avenger, an awesome task.  Bugs were fixed.
<br><br>
I mostly stayed away from the boards, too, but what I found was that very little changed there too.  Wizards are the latest class up in arms - why, I don't know, I play the class and love it - and they were going to stage a sit-out.  Well, more power to you, I hope you get what you want.  What you will get is more time spent on the items, the balance, the tweaks, and really, very little time spent on the game.  Verant, I think, in responding to the community, has become blinded to what the game really needs - Evolution.
<br><br>
When you play MUDs, you get a feel for the good ones and great ones.  The good ones are well planned, they have class balance, and challenging quests.  They have a large community, with good players, and the game world is interesting.  They are a lot like EverQuest.  The great ones - now the truly great ones - <em><b>grow</em></b>.  They are <b><em>epic</b></em>.
<br><br>
I have this fantasy I'd like to share with you.
<br><br>
"You have entered East Commons.<br>
Amoroth shouts "8 Tier'dal heading to Freeport, casters, beware."<br>
Sadrya shouts "Freeport Militia group heading to darkies from Inn.<br>
Wyndwyllow shouts "A troop, 15-20 strong of Freeport Sirs just zoned in!"<br>
You begin your casting.<br>
You disappear.<br>
Cairbre shouts "For Marr! We will defeat the invaders at First Inn"<br>
Fallan shouts "Heroes of Faydwer to Inn1!"<br>
Oxesiess shouts "Freeport is BURNING!"<br>
Amoroth shouts  "WHAT?"<br>
Groumpf shouts "IT IS IN FLAMES, HALF THE CITY IS GONE!!!!!"
<br><br>
Wow.  Try logging into East Freeport then - it will be gone.  Towers crumbled, dark elves laughing and singing in the streets.  Imagine refugee camps in the West Commons area, with a makeshift line of defenders from Rivervale and the Paladins of Marr.  Imagine the wholesale change in the way you view the world.  Favorite camp spots - gone.  Mobs with coveted items - gone.  The boats - with out a dock - drop you off at an island near the coast and you have to swim in.  The Freeport Militia has made a pact with the dark elves to rid them of the Paladins of Marr, and Norrath will never be the same.  Individual players can get items, spells, but they will never change history.
<br><br>
Now, I know what you are saying: there are a lot of quests out there, and many have a long storyline that can be followed from beginning to end.  Norrath has changed - Kithicor woods changed, Kunark will change Norrath.  You would be absolutely right.  But - and here's the difference - Norrath hasn't evolved.  The timeline of Norrath history has not altered the landscape.
<br><br>
EverQuest hasn't taken the step to greatness.  Instead, we hear whines when a spawn drop changes, or how difficult it is to camp the speedy gnome with the Jboots quest.  The player base has yanked EverQuest's vision into their own petty desires and goals: new items, new skills, new spells, so that they can strut around in knewl loot - until they find something new to whine about.  Verant has hired an able communicator to communicate with the players whose limited vision of EverQuest pulls it to be a 3d Diablo or Quake, at best.  They try to resist it - holding firm on not releasing stats and exp tables, for example - but their vision is being inundated with a flood of inconsequential anxieties.
<br><br>
We're missing the boat.  EverQuest is a good game, and people will play it, until they get bored of it - because it's the same every day.
<br><br>
Now, what can we do to fix it?  Well, for one thing, let's all take a long look at why we play - for the camaraderie, for the loot, for bragging rights, whatever - and realize some, if not all, of these things are fulfilled in a large-scale epic campaign.  It gives focus to our play, a goal above and beyond just the loot or levels.  Tell Verant.  Stop looking at the tree, check out the forest.
<br><br>
Some method has to be created in-house at Verant to make large scale changes to a existing zone without creating a multitude of bugs and pathing problems - re-creating each zone and testing it can't be something which needs to be done each time the world evolves.  Otherwise, you have Kunark.  I don't know if this can be done, it's probable that each zone has to be created from scratch, which would add weeks and weeks to the task.
<br><br>
A storyline that can take into account different servers and the possibility of multiple endings. Key "adventure points" where a decision tree would fork the story should allow for the zone changes to still be the same.  Actors are on hand in the Guides to play key roles in the story.  In a perfect game, the different servers should be able to have different storylines - after all, they are different worlds, with different people, are they not?
<br><br>
What if they change the world but no-one comes?  Many times I have heard of dynamic quests which have sputtered to nothing since some bozo decided to blast the main actor to cinders before it even started. Well, I would change the world anyway.  World shattering events could even take place with no player involvement, so long as there is change.  That way players, even though they weren't around when it happened, still feel like the world is changing, and it's exciting!  
<br><br>
May you live in interesting times.
