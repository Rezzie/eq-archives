<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
Allow me to introduce myself.  I am a Dark Elven rogue residing in the picturesque city of Neriak.  In an attempt to  broaden my horizons, I packed up my belongings and headed south to lovely Grobb, hoping to stay a few nights in the marshland village.  Rather than the 'romp in the swamp' I had desired, however, I was promptly bashed by the guards.  In my apparently naive mind, I had thought the sophisticated trolls of Grobb would welcome a traveler of similar 'ideals' to their own (many refer to both of our races as being evil, but moral values are relative, of course).  Would you, kind and knowledgable Moog, please clear the air between the Trollish guards and myself!
<br><br>

<b>Dear Raolin
<br><br>
No problems.  I go down and talk to dem right away.  While you in Grobb, come say hello…Moog gets lonely sometimes.  Tee hee!
</b>


<br><br><br>

<em>Dear Aunti Moog,
<br><br>
I was just wondering that if you answering all these questions then when do you have time to bash? I mean it must be difficult for you to think of so many words at any givin time.  Please don't think so much any more because I hate the smell of burning wood.  You should do what your good at and that is to uhh BASH!!

<em>Dear Aunti Moog,
<br><br>
*Ahem*
<br><br>
Greetings....I am a 12th rank Dark Magi, faithful son of Innoruuk.  I need help in a serious problem.  It is already tough to find a very hateful mate for a person of my nature, but lately I've noticed a re-occuring pattern in possible lady friends.  They seem to speak in very odd ways, such as "can u summon a dagger 4 me plz?" or "d0 u bind?"....I try to help them, but they either just leave without a word or a grumbled "thx".  I have no idea what this means.  I am well versed in over a dozen languages, even the accursed GNOLL tongue, yet these women still seem to be incoherent.  In the name of Innoruuk, what in Norrath is going on here?
