I have the whole weekend to myself.  My wife took the kids to Virginia to a wedding.
This was to be a weekend of total self-indulgence!  I woke up this morning feeling
fresh, ready to take on my first day of solo geekness.  I get my first cup of coffee
and head off to the computer.   I sit in front of my computer browsing through all
the file directories looking for a game to play.  I load Dungeon Keeper, and play it
for about five minutes, quickly loosing interest.  I then load StarCraft.   I enter a
Ladder game and after about fifteen minutes of that I’m again bored to tears.  This
repeats with about five other games, and I give up in disgust, loading up IRC to
watch the mindless chatter in #Everquest.

That’s $700 dollars worth of games that I cant even find myself wanting to play
anymore!  Actually I have to give some credit to Blizzard.  I did play Diablo for
over a year, and I can still find myself starting a character from time to time when
I’m in just the right mood.

What do game developer’s need to do to keep our interest in a game, especially a
game that they wish us to keep paying online services fees for.
<br><br>
What do I need to do to stop shelling out so much money on games I loose interest
in less than a week?
