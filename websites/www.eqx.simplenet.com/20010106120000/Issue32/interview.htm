<p style="text-align: justify">

We at EQX decided it would be fun to put the microphone out into the crowd you might say, and give the fans a chance to speak their piece.  I had the pleasure of speaking to probably the first fan EverQuest attracted.  He's known simply as "Dach".  
<br><br>
Dach started the first EverQuest fan site I'm told, and he was the founder of the #EverQuest channel on EFNet.  Dach attended E3 in Atlanta Ga., and has talked with many of the programmers from 989 Studios.  He is very active in the EQ scene, and most everyone really likes him, including me.  Dach also is one of our EQExpress writers, although he is not quite as active as we would like him to be.  He is a very talented writer when he wants too.  
<br><br>
Here is how the interview went.  
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hey thanks for meeting with me [<em>we shake hands</em>].     
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "There are quite a few EQ fans that will read this article.   I'm sure some of those readers would like to know a little about you.  Give us some background."
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Well, let's see.  I wouldn't call it a profession but I "work" at an office everyday making web pages and doing other gimpish work."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Hey that's a coincidence.  I'm a gimp too!"
<br><br>
[<em>Silence</em>]
<br><br>
[<em>I coughed</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "How did you find EverQuest?"
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "I came upon the EverQuest scene on my break at "work" one day. I was so impressed by it, and finding it was the game I had been wanting for a while, I decided to get more information, which eventually lead me to make the first fan site for it.  In addition, I soon after started up the #everquest we all know and love (well, not all)."
<br><br>
[<em>I Chuckled</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me about your first experience with an Online Multiplayer game?  Did you get addicted?"
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Very much so.  I know a lot of people in the EQ community will stone me, but my first experience that I really enjoyed was Quake.  It's the only online game I have been addicted to, so to speak.  My very, very first game was Duke Nukem 3D.  It was about the best you could do then, and it was interesting to me to play a game with another that was not on the same screen.  Followed by that were games like Descent and Mech Warrior, leading up to now." 
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Yea that was one of my first too"
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "I remember when we use to have geek parties at my house.."
<br><br>
[<em>Dach laughed and nodded in agreement</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "All my friends would drag their PC's over to my house and would plug into the network for hours of death matches.  I think It was Doom that we first played, but we progressed to Duke3d, Doom II. "
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "The good ole days"
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "In your opinion, where do you think online gaming is heading? Is this a short-lived fad, or is this just the beginning?   Is the Holodeck just around the corner for us?"
<br><br>     
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "No, I think it will remain popular.  In my eyes, multiplayer is what keeps a game good now days, and given I care for a great number of single player games, I never play them much longer then a week.  With online games, you meet new people (and kill them) and the greatest part of it all, to me is that the game itself can change.  Given in the future we might have to make certain sacrifices to enjoy multiplayer.  You can't have so much going on in a game that will cause the game to be lagged down by fancy graphics, even though it would be nice.  Given I know much less about this then others, and I am sure people are working on ways to have tea and cake at the same time.  On a brighter note, faster connections are becoming common place, but still, not everyone has a 0C3 sitting in the basement.                                                          
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "No doubt.  My little 128k ISDN is considered a mo-ped these days."
<br><br>
[<em>Dach laughed</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I talk a lot about my trials at home with my wife and family.  I'm just curious.  Are you married?
<br><br>
[<em>Dach laughed again</em>] 
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "No I am not married.  I did just recently start dating a very lovely girl however...in case anyone has been wondering where I might have been as of late, this is where my time is going."        
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    "OH and just how much time do you spend on EQ related stuff?"            
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      "It depends.  Not near as much as when I had a page to run of course.   I have many half written (and half thought out) writings that I intended putting in this paper (EQX), as well as a few projects of my own, and then even more with others, and then even more projects with others."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Do you think you'll make the beta's first cut?  2nd?  3rd?    Do you think you'll buy the game?  Has the closed beta already started and you're just not telling me?  Come on.  You can trust me."   
<br><br>
[<em>I grinned</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "I won't comment on any aspects of the beta.  I don't want people speculating if I am in, if I'm not, or if I will be.  As for it starting, you have official word from Brad on that I do believe."
<br><br>
[<em>I snorted</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "I plan to play an elf as one of my characters for EQ.  What type of character do you plan to play?" 
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Hmm, I have always said that my character is going to be a magic user of some sort.  Most likely a Wizard but possibly an Enchanter or both, hey, I have 8 slots after all.  I find magic more interesting to play then a warrior type, though warriors used to be all that I would play.  As for skills, the common magic skills will do like channeling, invoking and so forth.  As long as he can cast magic I'll be happy."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Other than EQX, what sites do you contribute too?" 
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "None"
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [<em>I Laughed</em>]&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just like me."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "I'm a one site kinda guy."
<br><br>
[<em>Dach laughed</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "How do you feel about guilds?  Do you plan to join one?  Oh you're in a guild.  Why did you choose them?"
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  " I used to like the idea of guilds really.  But after a while I thought to myself self, why be in a guild with all kinds of rules and restrictions when I can just play with my friends anyway?  I don't know if I'll be joining one now, I guess I'll see in the future."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "If you came across Razor in your in-game travels, would you give him money and other donations?  <em>Just kidding but</em> would you?"
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "It depends, were you trying to steal from me?"
<br><br>
[<em>We both laughed</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Do you feel EQ will live up to the name its fans are creating for it?" 
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "I believe it will, but it really is up to each individual fan.  There will always be some disappointed people, no matter how good something is or how much it offers, there are always the people who want more. But as far as living up to its name as a new break away massive multiplayer RPG, then yes, I think it will live up to it and more."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Did you play muds?"
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   A little bit.  I played Medievia a lot in the old days and a few others that I don't recall.  Plus a really spiffy Quake MUD 
<br><br>
[<em>Dach laughed</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "I really think 989S is on track with this GUI mud for lack of a better term.  You don't know how long I personally have waited for this type of game.  What are your thoughts?  You mentioned earlier EQ 'Caught' your eye.  What was it that did it for you?"
<br><br>
Dach folded his arms behind his head and then leaned back in his chair.
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "What caught my eye were the words "<em>massive</em>", "<em>multiplayer</em>" and "<em>RPG</em>"
<br><br>
He paused a brief moment and then added
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "I wanted a game like this before I knew what it was I wanted, to be honest.  It just struck me as the type of game I wanted when I went to the EverQuest's home page for the first time."
<br><br>
I looked him square in the eye and asked him my last question.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Dach if you had just one wish.  One thing you would like to see included in EQ.  What would it be?  Why?
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Really everything I want is pretty much in EQ.  Maybe they would put in some NPC's that I want... 
<br><br>
He held his hand up about waist high and added: 
<br><br>
<b>Dach:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Perhaps a walking piece of bacon about this high."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Man I can't thank you enough for this interview.  I really hope we cross paths online.  I would be honored to travel with you.   Thanks again."
