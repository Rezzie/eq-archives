<b>HALAS - </b>
<br><br>
Much to my surprise, the Barbarians seem to be on the cutting edge of modern dance.  McQuaid's Dark Stout in Halas is the epicenter of this cultural revolution.  Kathe and Ospakar, two adventurers who frequent that establishment, have invented a dance they call the Slam.  This is so named for two reasons.  First, they slam a few strong ales to get themselves loose on their feet.  Second, this wobbliness causes them to slam into each other while they wave, bow, crouch, and jump around the dancefloor.  No doubt travelers will soon spread the practice to other lands.  Could this be the start of Norrath's first dance craze?

<b>RIVERVALE - </b>
<br><br>
Reports from the happy town of Rivervale have it that a very disturbing things have been happening.  Halfling farmers and children have been missing for several days.  In all, two farm families and one goatherd have been lost, three adult males, two females, and seven children ranging in age from two to sixteen years old.  Most of the Sheriffs of the Vale blame the Goblins.  This is not surprising, considering the long feud between the two races.  But sources within the thieves guild of Rivervale...  if there was such a thing, anyway... have told us that several Tier'dal have been seen in the area of late.  One of the little rogues claims to have overheard three of them arguing while he was exploring some ancient ruins nearby.  He claims that he discovered the dark elves resting in the ruins, eating a cold meal of some sort of uncooked meat.  Before fleeing, the young thief claims to have heard the inkies discussing the value of the size of a meal over the quality.  He seemed to think that they came to an agreement that quality is more important.  He also claims to have heard one of them praying over the meal, though he could not understand the words, for he spoke in the tongue of the ancient dark ones.
<br><br>
All citizens of the Vale have been warned to remain indoors.  But this reporter believes that the threat has passed.  I know something of the dark ones, and I believed the young thief.  If I am correct, the danger has passed, and the god of Hate is well pleased.

<b>QEYNOS -</b> 
<br><br>
Rumors of the death of Antonius Bayle are just that, rumors.  Though unable to obtain a meeting with the great leader, we have spoken to dozens of people in the government, and all of them assured us that he is well and is simply in seclusion for religious reasons.
