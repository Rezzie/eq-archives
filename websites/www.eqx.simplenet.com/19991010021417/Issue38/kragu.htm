<em><b>Part I - They are But Gods</b></em>
<br><br>
They are but Gods, and Gods aren't perfect.  There is no question about that.  The only proof required is to look at Norrath.  How could they treat us this way, they have little mercy and only truly care for themselves and the power that they can exert on their devoted of followers.
<br><br>
The Gods have existed for millennia, or perhaps millennia of millennia, it does not matter. All we can guess is that they are as weak willed as the rest of us, for they to crave power and influence.  It is an amusing thing to believe, be faithful to, and pray to these Gods. That is as it should be, at least the balance of life still exists, and without balance we would all surely perish.
<br><br>
The legend says that the Gods created the races as a display of their power to all of the other Gods.  The problem was simply that they created many races, and in an effort to show their true power they had their races war incessantly.  It took the Gods many wars to finally realize their foolish desires were actually weakening their spheres of influence even within the heavens.  It seemed that all of their favorite heroes would last but a few short years before perishing.  The wars lessened each race, and each generation was weaker than the last.  In a brief moment of clarity the Gods reached a pact that all agreed to. This pact was the birth of The Chosen.
<br><br>
The Chosen are indeed a rare breed of individuals for they are the best of the best for each of the races.  The Chosen do not truly die, for if they did then the races would eventually vanish into history.  The Chosen must be able to live, so that they can continue their bloodlines.
<br><br>
The Chosen always die when young, for this is the only way that they can truly learn of their destiny, their destiny to defend their people.  After their first death they learn of their fate and it is at this time that they choose their profession. 
<br><br>
Being responsible for the defense of their people does place a lot of weight on the shoulders of these young charges.  It may seem that going into combat and knowing that death is not possible would make them reckless, but the truth is much more complicated.  The Chosen know who they are, and the first to fall in combat are not The Chosen themselves. No, that would be too easy.  The first to fall are the loved ones, for the only way to really harm one of The Chosen is to kill their friends and family.  To truly defeat on of the Chosen one must crush their spirit.
<br><br>
The so-called death of a Chosen One is no different than the death of the true mortals.  They can still die by sword or sorcery, but after their death they are reborn in a place far from where they fell.  There may be magic that can raise them closer to where they fell, but if it exists it is not known by many.  The one true fact is that after they have been raised they are weaker than when they fell.  This is because the Gods require energy to re-birth their minions, and it is their minions that provide the energy.  It is also a way to remind the Chosen who their real masters are.
<br><br>
It is rumored that the first words heard by the Chosen after their first death is simply 'Your in our world now'.  Indeed the Gods are a cruel bunch and the world of Norrath is a harsh place to be born.  But it is never dull.
<br><br>

<em><b>Part II : The Legend Begins</b></em>
<br><br>
<b>The Birth of a Man</b>
<br><br>
Kragu came unto the world of Norrath, like many of his brethren, wailing and desperate for a warm heart to hold him.  His night was typical of this northern clime, cold windy and dry.  There was nothing strange about his birth, at least not what most people would notice.
<br><br>
His childhood was typical for the Barbarians of the north, nomadic and hard.  He was, however, an exceptional child. He was stronger, quicker and brighter than the rest of the children in the clan.  His abilities, though noticeable, didn't earn him a lot of undue attention, and that was how the boy liked it.  His old grandfather did take notice, however.   His grandfather, Anagu, was a enigma amongst the clan as he was an old man with a mysterious past.  It was said that he had traveled to distant lands and fought creatures beyond imagining.  Kragu was a boy of 12 when Anagu began the lessons.  These lessons were kept secret because barbarians don't look well upon the ways of others.  Kragu was a bright lad and soon realized the  importance of understanding the ways of Norrath.  He also knew that he had a lot more to learn.  
<br><br>
At the tender age of 15, Kragu was in final preparations for his ascension into manhood, a ceremony of some importance for the Barbarian tribes.  On the night of his ascension Anagu finally told the young man of the legend that was to shape his future.  But to Kragu, it was but another story.
<br><br>
<b>The Legend</b>
 <br><br>
Back in time, ages ago in a land far away there was a warrior of such stature that many believed him to be a god.  His name was simply Kragu.  Kragu's origins are unknown, but he was as mighty a warrior as ever lived.  His strength was legendary, his love of life strong, and he was as cunning as an arctic fox.
<br><br>
The legend goes that Kragu became a favorite of one of the early lost gods who has disappeared.  It was foretold that a war of the heavens would ignite and this God, with his mighty hammer, was to do battle with a great beast, but while he battled the beast his faithful legion of warriors would fall to a horde of demons.  The God knew what would happen, but a vision offered hope.  There existed a another hammer that could be used by a God, and if a hero could locate this new hammer then the hero could wield the Gods hammer to slay the beast.  This would allow the God to fight beside his legion and bring a resounding victory.
<br><br>
It was Kragu that was to find the hammer, and in time he did.  After the heavenly battle, where the forces of good were victorious, the God was slain, Kragu was slain and both mighty hammers were lost.  It is said that the mortal hammer still exists, and the one who wields it is will forever be able to defeat the mighty armies of darkness.
<br><br>
<b>Kragu the Chosen</b>
<br><br>
The clan had been on the hunt for over three weeks, and they were growing weary of the cold nights.  The night sky was cloudy, which was a little unusual for this time of season, but truth be told, nothing was unusual on the Frigid Plain.  The camp was quiet and few were awake when the sentry raised the alarm.  As young Kragu reached for his hammer a giant club crashed through the top of the snow hut, smashing into the packed snow beside him.  The stench of the creature left no doubt that the invaders were Ogres, the behemoths from the south.  Kragu leaped up and dodged the clumsy blow of the putrid beast.  Kragu knew he was in trouble, for he was no match for the monster.  He was able to parry another blow but was hurtled to the ground.  Only the quick desperate roll saved him.  As he looked up he saw his father attack the Ogre with a furious abandon from the side.  Looking around it was clear that the Ogres were far to many for even the Barbarians to handle.  Kragu spotted the clans final defensive perimeter and rushed to join them. It was then that Kragu knew he would die, but the battle raged on.  The death blow was quick and unseen.
<br><br>
The images were distant at first, clouded and confusing.  It appeared as a great battle with huge giant men against legions of radiant warriors.  It was the tall golden warrior and his mighty hammer that brought the legend to mind, for Kragu was witnessing the legendary battle as it was played out eons before.  His namesake was nowhere to be seen, but he could feel the presence of the hero.  The images clouded over once again, and he heard one final unseen voice 'Your in our world now.'
  <br><br>
Kragu awoke in a dark and cold chamber in the same pain that should have left him dead.  He didn't understand.  Where was he? Why was he? How was he?  Alive!  He reached back into his mind and retrieved the memories of the heavenly battle and realized that for some reason he had been spared death.  
<br><br>
A small sound outside the chamber preceded the entrance of the old man.  The man brought a special calm to the young warrior, one that couldn't be ignored.  The man stood, and looked, observing the youth.  'You will have to do.' was all he said.
<br><br>
The man led Kragu into a great chamber of books, scrolls, and tomes.  It was here that Kragu was told that he was Chosen.  It was here that Kragu knew his fate and knew his destiny.  It was his turn to seek out the mighty hammer, the one that could ensure the triumph of good over evil, when they next met.

Thank you Zephyr, this is indeed an interesting view on death in role playing, and it is rich with
classic mythology. I also like how it is still quite central to Norrath's history and theme. It is
fairly easy to believe that if there were a million people living in norrath that nearely 1500 of
them could be these "chosen" by the gods for this on-going tempest between themselves..
<br><br>
Thanks again for an excellent read,
