"Please, everything I have is for your needs. There will be no reason 
for weaponsplay!" urged Turlas Delk. 
<br><br>

Her hard features seemed to soften as she spoke. "Hameil, that is a 
strong name and I see that you indeed have power in the flesh beneath 
these robes." She moved her hands over his shoulders and felt his

could feel her sweet breath on his face. "Tell me what it is that caused 
you to look upon me as you did."

Never had he felt so alive. "Your movement it was that first caught my 
eye my lady. So fast, so fluid and powerful. I lay froze awaiting 
instruction from my training and instinct of which I seem to have 
little. Further I admit I was trapped by your beauty. Even if I had 
wanted to move I doubt if my heart would have let me."
