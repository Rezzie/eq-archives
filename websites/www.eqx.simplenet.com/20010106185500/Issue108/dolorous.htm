The old man coughed then gasped; he motioned the young boy to remain seated. "What!" he roared, sounding more surprised than he intended. He slammed down his wooden cup on the table, splashing its dark contents on his tattered wool sleeve. "Why in the world would you want to hear a story like that?"
<br><br>
The young boy scratched the dull point of one of his ears. He looked into the corner of the dark room, or at his feet, or anything that wasn't the old man. Nervously he said, "It's just that I heard that you knew Rowhin Ardour, grandfather." The boy started to think how much he would rather be outside playing with his friends. The old man grinned slightly, he was the boy's great grandfather but he wasn't about to correct the child.
<br><br>
The old man's name was Demilin. His own son was killed many years before in the Orc war, but not before having a child. There have been many Orc wars through out the ages, but the most recent one within living memory was always referred to as the "Orc war." Its official name in historical books was the "Orc conflict of 3250." Two years after his son died in combat, his son's wife took ill and died leaving their four-year-old son Jonti. Demilin took Jonti and moved away from Freeport to a small village far away from the problems of the world. Jonti had little memory of his parents and called Demilin his father. Jonti grew up happily in the village. He helped Demilin brew a variety of beers, ales, and stouts that they sold to the only inn in town and to the occasional merchant the passed through. They made a modest living selling their concoctions. When Jonti was a young man he married a local girl and they had a child named Demlen, after his grandfather.
<br><br>
Demilin's grin vanished and was replaced by a stare that could stop a dragon. The boy's eyes widened, and he hoped the old man didn't notice him gulp. The boy had never known a look like that and it frightened him. Sweat formed on his brow, all he wanted was to bolt out of the small house, but the fire in the old man's eyes bound the boy helpless, as surely as rope or chain. Long moments of silence passed. The boy tried to apologize, but the words wouldn't come out. 
<br><br>
"I can see you are too young and foolish to know better." the old man groaned. "You'll probably pester me till my grave. Fetch me another stout and I'll tell you a tale of great sorrow." The boy was surprised at how easily he got up; he hurriedly grabbed the wooden cup and took it to the cask to be filled. He seriously considered the consequences if he was to run away now. He decided against it, the old man would have his hide if he didn't return with his stout. He walked back slowly and gave the old man his cup. Demilin set the cup down and said, "sit boy." Then he leaned forward and grabbed the boy's attention, and he began the tale of Rohwin Ardour.
<br><br>

"Aye, I did know Rohwin when I was a young man, a few years older than yourself. I was fishing on the docks of Freeport when the ship sailed in. The crowds of people were making their way either on or off the ship. I had to be careful or risk being forced into the water. I took notice of a young Half-Elf stepping off the gangplank with a Human, presumably his father. It was hard to make friends in Freeport; all the human children made fun of my ears. I was lonely and needed a friend."
<br><br>
The boy was confused. Freeport was so much larger than the village they lived in now, and he had lots of friends. Demilin read the boy's face clearly. "Freeport hasn't always been as diverse as it is now. When I was young, Half-Elves weren't very welcome anywhere. At best we were tolerated. The full Elves looked down on us as if we were polluted or diseased. The Dwarves don't really like anybody. Only the Humans would accept us, if somewhat grudgingly. More and more Half-Elves were moving to Freeport. Resentment started to grow as we were blamed for increases in crimes and others said we were taking their jobs. Half-Elves had to stick together, which didn't help the Humans attitudes. Most Half-Elves lived in East Freeport, a very poor section of the city. I lived in North Freeport among the Humans. Humans generally didn't like me and other Half-Elves frowned at me, calling me Half-Human. For such a large city, Freeport was quite a lonely one." The boy looked as if he understood, but Demilin knew he would never fully understand the ways of the world until he experienced it himself. The old man paused to consider if he should explain further, then decided against it.
<br><br>
"I was elated when the boy's father walked up to me," the old man continued. "He asked me where a decent Inn could be found. I gave him haphazard directions to a better part of town. He thanked me and pitched me a silver piece minted from Felwithe. I quickly said it would be best if I showed him the way, so he doesn't get lost. He laughed and told me to lead on. He probably thought I was looking to get more silver, perhaps not. On the way to north Freeport I learned that the boy's name was Rohwin and he was indeed traveling with his father from Felwithe. I talked a little with Rohwin and his father. I learned that Rohwin's father was a tailor. He wanted to teach Rohwin his trade, but Rohwin had other interests. It seemed to be a sore point between them, or maybe they were just very tired from their journey.  I guided them to an inn near my house. Then I gave my farewells and ran off before seeing if I was to receive more silver. In the days that followed I made it my habit to walk by the inn often. Sure enough, I did see Rohwin again, and we became friends. It didn't take very long for us to become the best of friends. We did everything together and were carefree and happy for years. We would fish at the dock, and watch the ships come and go. Though often as not, we would use our poles as mock swords."
<br><br>
When he would look out to the sea, a little sadness crept into his eyes. If I asked him about it, he would assure me he had dirt or something in his eye. One time when we were skipping rocks on the water he told me of his mother. She was a High-Elf. His father and mother had separated when he was very young, but they both had lived in Felwithe. Rohwin was raised by his father, but visited his mother often and was very close to her. After his mother remarried, Rohwin's father decided to move back to his homeland. There was much protest from Rohwin, but father had decided. When Rohwin's mother didn't step in on Rohwin's behalf, he felt betrayed and sad. After that, I never asked what was the matter when we were at the docks. I never knew if he was upset with his mother or missed her, probably a little of both. The only time we weren't together was when his father took him to the priests of Mithaniel Marr. My parents and I followed the ways of Erollisi Marr. Rohwin always talked of truth and justice, but he sounded like he was just repeating someone else's words.
<br><br>
Early one morning, Rohwin asked if he could come with my parents and me to the Temple of Marr and talk with the priests of Erollisi Marr. I said "of course" and we went to the temple. He talked at length with the priests, so long in fact that my parents left us there so they could eat. My stomach made its own protests, but I waited for Rohwin. When he was done it was well past noon and we went out to seek some food with the few coppers my parents had given me. We enjoined a meager lunch and went down to the docks for awhile. We watched the boats maneuver around each other, and examined all the people arriving and departing. Rohwin was especially quiet today. I was getting tired and wanted to go home, but Rohwin insisted that we could stay a little longer. We were looking out across the Ocean of Tears when a large shadow loomed over us. Before I could turn around Rohwin was jerked off the ground. "Rohwin!" his father yelled. I turned to see Rohwin hanging by his shirt from his father's grasp. "Where have you been?" his father yelled loud enough to turn a few heads at the docks. He lowered his voice a little and said "We were supposed to see the priests of Mithaniel this morning." His father dragged him away to continue his yelling in a little more privacy. I was surprised to see Rohwin did not look scared or sad. He went with his father with a determination that I've never seen on him before. They argued back and forth, though just out of earshot. After a short while his father walked him back and deposited him next to me. "If you want to follow Erollisi like your mother," his father grumbled, "then so be it. At least you still walk in the light." His father stalked off with a look of a little disappointment. Rohwin had no expression at all. He said he needed to be alone and walked off.
<br><br>
In the years that followed no one spoke of the incident at the docks. Everyone got on well enough, but Rohwin's relationship with his father was never the same. Rohwin would attend the Temple of Marr with me. His father never stood in the way of one of Rohwin's decisions. In fact, his father even congratulated him (though not whole-heartedly) when Rohwin announced that he was going to train as a Paladin of Erollisi Marr. The priests told him he had a gift for channeling and if his faith was strong Erollisi would grant him the spells that a Paladin would use to help the weak and wage war against evil. He could not feel any power within him, but the priests assured him it was there. Rohwin walked around proudly in his training tunic and short sword. We still talked and spent time together, but his duties to Erollisi commanded much of his time. 
<br><br>
Soon after, I got a job in my uncle's tavern, cleaning up after the drunks. My uncle said that in time he would show me the art of his brewing. (The old man took a long sip from his cup, closed his eyes and smiled with satisfaction, then dropped his smile and continued his story.) Now it seemed we had little time for each other. I didn't see him for months. Until one day he strode in the tavern and plopped a modest bag of coin on the bar and announced "drinks for everyone." The patrons responded with mock gratitude, but Rohwin paid them no heed. He told me that he had fallen in love. I congratulated him, even though I was a little skeptical, it wasn't the first time I've heard this from Rohwin. He had always talked how one day Erollisi would grant him true love, that he would marry the most beautiful girl in Norrath. He had been infatuated a few times, but they were always short lived. He would fall in love, she'd leave him, and then he'd cry a little and move on. I would tell him that she wasn't the right one for him anyway, but he'd never believe me until he met his next girl. Then we would repeat this cycle. However, this time was different. His face was all smiles but his eyes held that determination I saw on the docks so many years ago. A few moments later "she" walked in. Rohwin was right, she was the most beautiful girl in Norrath. At least in Freeport anyway. Her name was Sullairia. She was a Human with long red hair and green eyes that would light up a room at midnight. She walked with a grace that made you forget what you were doing or saying. Even the High-Elves would have been jealous of her beauty. The way they looked at each other spoke more than any poem of love. My uncle gave me the night off and the three of us drank the night away.
<br><br>
The young boy had no idea his "grandfather" knew Rohwin Ardour so well, but he wanted to hear the stories of fighting the undead and the dervish. "But what about-"
<br><br>
"Silence boy!" Demilin snapped. The boy felt as if he had been switched, even though the old man never moved. "Interrupt again and I'll bend you over my knee." Demilin studied the boy. He knew that Demlen was growing bored of village life. The boy wanted adventure and excitement. Demilin tried to teach him about the world, but the boy held a romance in his heart that would not be swayed. Demilin recognized looks and attitudes from his own youth in the boy. The old man hoped that it would not get the boy killed. The boy sat still and listened carefully as the old man continued.
<br><br>
"She was training to be a Cleric at the Temple of Marr. They studied and trained together whenever possible. She was nineteen, same as Rohwin. We thought we were all adults with the world waiting for our grand entrance. Now I realize that we were brainless idiots, mere fragile children in a world without mercy." The old man could see his warning to the boy had no effect. He sighed silently to himself and got on with his tale.
<br><br>
Quite a pair they were, though! They would have already been married, but Rohwin insisted on sending word to his mother first, so she could attend the ceremony. I saw Rohwin often during the next month. He talked of the wedding and his bride to be. I have to admit Sullairia was everything he ever wanted. She was intelligent and wise for her age. She had a laugh that could ease the darkest feelings and was so very beautiful. Rohwin's studies were falling behind. Understandably so, but not acceptable according to the priests. Rohwin assured them that he would be back on track soon enough, but the priests did worry about him. Rohwin and Sullairia were to attend a small caravan of Priests of Erollisi, Clerics, and Paladins to Rivervale. The Temple of Marr was delivering some artifact or something. They were trying to increase the Temple's favor with Rivervale in hopes of one day establishing a Temple there. Both Rohwin and Sullairia were so excited because neither had ever ventured so far west.
<br><br>
A day before they were to leave Rohwin was told his studies were too far behind to go on the trip. Rohwin argued with the priests and tried to justify why he should go, but they knew he only wanted to be close to Sullairia. Finally he submitted to the priests, and hid himself in his room for an agonizing two weeks of intense study. After a few days he came to me late at night, close to closing time. He said he couldn't stand being away from her so long. He thought he might run away to be with her. I convinced him quickly that that was a foolish plan. Instead he decided to write her a letter. I had a few days off coming up so I volunteered to deliver it personally. By myself I could catch the lumbering caravan in no time. Rohwin hastily wrote several letters, crumpling one after another. Then he paused, closing his eyes for several minutes, and wrote one last letter. He folded it and sealed it with wax then handed it to me. I took it and said I would leave at first light. He left with a smile; he looked refreshed and energetic.
<br><br>
I got up well before dawn and gathered the supplies I would need for the short trip. Some food and water, a borrowed short sword, and a blanket. I packed light so I could make the best possible time. I knew the immediate surroundings well so I headed out thirty minutes before dawn. The Commonlands were beautiful, gentle hills and tall trees. The leaves were turning colors falling to the ground. I followed the well-worn path that snaked through the green grass. In a few weeks the rains would begin, the hard packed dirt trail would turn to mud making journeys to and from Freeport very difficult. I felt strong with my short sword belted to my side. Of course, I knew the Commonlands were not terribly dangerous. There were bears and wolves that I didn't want to meet, but I wasn't likely to find any. As long as I stayed alert I could avoid any complications. 
<br><br>
The first day went without incident; I even avoided any spiderlings or fire beetles rather than take any chances. My infravision allowed me to travel for a few hours after dark, but when the moon set the ambient light was too scarce to see. I made camp several paces off the trail. I ate what I thought a day's rations should be and tried to sleep. My thin blanket was entirely inadequate. I shivered though the night but the thick layers of dead leaves were soft enough to sleep on. I got up early the following morning, ate a cold breakfast and set out on the beaten path to Rivervale. The woods were very quiet and peaceful; I wish I had the time to enjoy them more, but I knew I needed to travel fast. Rohwin would be a jumble of nerves until he learned Sullairia had received his letter, and my uncle was expecting me back in a few days more. 
<br><br>
After the sun had passed noon I came across a band of merchants headed for Freeport. They confirmed that the caravan was on the path and that I could probably catch them in three days. I politely refused to look at their goods. I had no time to haggle with merchants. Their leader grunted something, but I was off before he could finish. The waxing moon was staying a little longer in the sky each night so I made it a little further that night. I finally decided to stop and make camp a short way off the path. After eating I curled up as best I could and slept. I awoke that night with a startle. Something was near my camp. I peered into the night but the swaying trees and bushes played tricks on my eyes. I though I heard a low murmur, but I couldn't be sure. My imagination ran wild. Perhaps those merchants were really bandits. Maybe they came back to rob or murder me. Nonsense, they could see that I had nothing of value. Only the sounds of birds and insects remained now, but I didn't get a wink more sleep. 
<br><br>
I spent the remainder of the night sitting with my back to a tree with my sword across my lap. The sun's first light started to creep across the horizon. I gathered my things and left without eating breakfast. I needed to get far away from there. By mid-afternoon my hunger finally overcame my uneasiness. I stopped for a quick bite of some stale muffins and water. I felt so much better after eating that I all but forgot the creepy night before. I managed to sleep a little that night, but I did keep my sword unsheathed under my blanket. The next day went without incident. This trip was longer and harder than expected. I was thinking of all the ways Rohwin could repay me later. The sun had set, but there would still be plenty of light for awhile. I smelled the smoke from a campfire accompanied with smells of cooking meat. If I had come across the caravan already then I had made very good time indeed. I followed my nose off the trail and was relieved when I saw the banners of Marr displayed around the camp. Lucky for me I didn't pass them in the night.
<br><br>
I walked directly towards the camp and was stopped suddenly by a sword resting on my shoulder from behind. "Who goes there?" a voice boomed from behind. I was relieved to see that his white surcoat bore the symbol of Erollisi. A single rose with a thorny vine spiraling beneath it. He was a Human Paladin. His chainmail reflected thousands of points of moonlight. My own sword seemed completely inadequate when compared to his gleaming steel long sword. He was tall and very powerfully built. The confidence in his voice, stare, and posture commanded respect. I quickly told him I had a message for Sullairia from Rohwin. He grabbed the letter when I displayed it for him. He studied the letter and me for a few moments, a little longer then I would have found comfortable. "Come with me" he said, as if I had a choice when he gripped my shirt a dragged me behind him at a pace too fast for me to walk easily. The priest he presented me to frowned at the letter, and after a short conversation he directed me to where I could find Sullairia. He said I was welcome to stay at their camp tonight and let me go with my gear and sword still strapped to my side. Then he directed the Paladin, "Gamadel" he called him, to return to his sentry duty. The camp was larger then I thought, maybe two score Paladins and half as many Clerics and half a dozen priests. The bulk of the camp was made up of servants, I estimate eighty or more people running around tending to fires, wagons, or beasts of burden. I found Sullairia scrubbing pots with an unhelpful, plump woman standing over her saying "hurry girl, if everyone is to eat tonight." I'd never seen Sullairia so filthy. Her hair was a mess and her dress was soiled, but she was still beautiful. I'm sure I was a much worse sight to behold. The women tried to shoo me away but I explained my business and she let me deliver the letter with a grumbling resistance about chores and eating and such. I blocked her out of my mind and delivered the letter to an excited Sullairia. She read it quickly with the woman staring at her and tapping her foot expectantly. Sullairia's face brightened and her smile made me forget all the aches, pains, and tiredness I was feeling.
<br><br>
"Oh you must return a letter for me, would you please..." she exclaimed, while the plump woman grew ever more impatient.
<br><br>
"Of course" I said, "I would be more than-."
<br><br>
"Yes, Yes, all fine and good" the woman interrupted. "Now be on your way young man, there is still much work to be done. You can speak with Sullairia when her duties are done." On that note, I made my retreat and found the warmth of a nearby fire very comforting. Dinner that night consisted of stew, bread, water, and bear meat. It seems a Paladin had slain a bear earlier that day and there was enough meat for everyone, even the servants. The bread was durable and the meat tough, but it tasted better than a winter's feast day meal to me. I sat with the servants that night and listened to their jokes and stories with great interest, but Sullairia was nowhere to be found. After eating I was recruited to help clean up and they worked me until nearly midnight. When they finally released me they showed me to a servant's tent and actually provided a cot for me. I was exhausted; I looked forward to a good night's sleep tonight.
<br><br>
"Psst" came from the darkness outside the tent.  Most of the servants were asleep so I groaned as I got up from the cot. I poked my head out of the tent to see Sullairia beckoning me outside. Of course, I had forgotten. We went off a little ways so we didn't disturb the others. The campfires were nothing more than glowing embers now. A few torches were still alight around the camp, but would not last much longer. Also, the moon had just set. It was dark in the camp, but it was easy to see Sullairia's face. She handed me a letter folded and sealed as neatly as Rohwin's. "Thank you so very much" she whispered. "I can't tell you how happy I am." Then she plucked a wild flower from the ground, its colors a swirl of red and white. "Please give Rohwin this too, he'll understand." she said as she gave me the flower as well.
<br><br>
"As my lady commands," I said in a playful and complimentary way as I bowed to her. She giggled slightly, hugged me, and gave me a small kiss on the cheek. She thanked me once more and disappeared back towards her tent. I stood there a few moments longer then started back to my own tent.
<br><br>
That was when the first scream shattered the night. Then another scream sounded from somewhere else in the camp. Suddenly the whole camp was turned inside out. Inhuman yells drowned out all other noise. Then the sounds of steel against steel and war cries and the screams of men dying raged all around. "Orcs!" was the cry from all around the camp to add to the din. My tent rustled violently as men came running out, many of which were half dressed. Then the side of my tent was cut away to reveal an Orc standing there with blood dripping from his scimitar. Some of the servants, groaning in agony, laid mortally wounded at his feet. 
<br><br>
I could see the hate in his red eyes as he stared right at me. My sword was tucked safely under my cot, not that it would have done much good. This Orc stood taller than any man did, with dented and scarred armor from long use. His breath in the cold night air looked like plumes of smoke streaming out of his wide nose. I thought that surely he would strike me down with a breath of fire or something equally nasty. He bared his chipped, glistening fangs then ran towards me faster than I would have thought possible. I tried to run but I was frozen in place with fear. 
<br><br>
I couldn't even turn my head so I closed my eyes tight. Then there was a huge crash and grunts, which caused me to open me eyes. A Paladin had intercepted the huge Orc. His long sword flashed furiously in the night, but the Orc parried repeatedly and counter attacked with such force that the Paladin was now on the defensive, but he expertly deflected the blows with his shield. A dim torch silhouetted the Orc, making his features difficult to see, but the Paladin's chainmail shined brightly. The Paladin almost seemed to radiate light from the effect. Only the Orc's eyes and scimitar showed clearly against dark backdrop of the forest. It was literally a fight between light and dark. Strength returned to my legs and I rushed by the pair to my ruined tent. I pulled out my short sword, leaving the scabbard behind. My sword seemed so puny and worthless against the might of an Orc, but I had to do something. I turned to see the Paladin beating back the Orc now. The Paladin's sword swung with precision and grace, his attacks were impossibly fast, scoring numerous glancing blows. However, the Orc was an experienced warrior as well and suffered little damage. Then the Orc hit the Paladin squarely in the left shoulder. Shinny bits of chainmail and blood sprayed from the wound. His shield dropped to the ground as his arm hung limply by his side. The Paladin didn't cry out but was clearly out-matched now. Every swing of the Orc scimitar forced him back. 
<br><br>
I rushed the Orc from the side and swung my sword wildly. I was surprised to see my sword sink easily into the Orc's arm. I stood there transfixed on the wound I had caused, then the Orc bashed me with the pommel of his scimitar and I went sprawling backwards racked with pain and my vision all a blur. The distraction was all the Paladin needed, his long sword buried itself in the Orc's neck. Blood sprayed in a huge fountain soaking his once shiny chainmail. Without a scream, the Orc fell with a thud and then the Paladin sank to his knees.
<br><br>
I looked around to see for the first time that the battle was all around me. Orcs were everywhere, swinging swords and stabbing with spears. More than ten Paladins laid dead or dying, with as many Clerics fallen by their side. Orcs littered the ground as well. As many as forty lay motionless with grotesque expressions of pain or hatred on their faces. A Cleric rushed to the side of the Paladin who saved me. She stood motionless for a second then points of blue light showered around her like dandelion petals in a soft breeze. The Paladin retrieved his shield and stood. He glanced at me, gave me the slightest of nods, then rushed back into the battle. Only now did I recognize him as Gamadel, the same one who brought me into the camp. 
<br><br>
The Cleric signaled me to follow her and I stepped quickly to do so. Fifteen Paladins and five Clerics had formed a defensive semi-circle around many of the servants and priests alike. Two overturned wagons formed an insecure wall to the back of the semi-circle. Many of the servants had taken up spears to guard any holes in the defensive line and keep any would be attackers in check. Sullairia was among those in the circle, thank Erollisi she was unharmed. She stood tall and cast her spells along side the other Clerics. Beyond the circle was chaos. The Orc's numbers stretched out past the light of the camp; there was no way to know how many there were. Paladins hacked and swung and dropped many Orcs fast, but it seemed inevitable that the Orcs would eventually overwhelm the camp. The only thing holding back the masses were the Clerics casting spells of destruction into the ranks of massed Orcs. Brave souls pulled wounded Paladins and Clerics from the battlefield, back to the relative safety of the circle. The Clerics would cast their magic of healing on the wounded. Once any of the wounded had the strength to stand on their own, they would replace one of the members of the circle so the other could rush out to join the melee. 
<br><br>
This process continued to keep fresh fighters out in the battle. However, the strain of so much casting would soon exhaust the Clerics, and there seemed to be an unlimited supply of Orcs. The Paladins casted some spells too, but were generally too busy swinging their swords to have the time for the complex movements associated with spell casting. Sullairia's strength was in healing; her offensive spells had little or no effect against the Orcs. Serious wounds had to be healed by an experienced Cleric, but her own healing was instrumental in keeping Paladins ready for action in far less time than resting alone. Many Orcs fought through the melee to reach the circle, but were quickly killed or turned back by the well disciplined men and women defending. The disruption of the advancing Orc lines and the confusion of the melee worked to our advantage by not allowing a coordinated Orc attack on the circle.
<br><br>
To my horror I saw an Orc march through two Paladins, cutting them down like unmoving practice targets, then a third fell to its two-handed sword with a blade as black as night. The blade was more then just black. It was like an absence of everything where a blade should have been. What could be seen were its effects. Men and women were being slaughtered. A Cleric directed all his attention at the fierce Orc. Fire engulfed the Orc, but it only seemed to wash over him around a transparent sphere. Then the Orc extended his hand and energy shot forth, blowing the Cleric back a dozen feet on to his back. He did not get up. By now many Paladins were grouped around this Orc. Their swords were deflected harmlessly by an unseen barrier. One Paladin fell, but rest kept the Orc too busy to advance any further. Large gaps opened in the melee and Orcs poured through to attack the circle in force. Instantly the circle shrunk under the pressing weight of so many attackers, but the defensive line held. 
<br><br>
Cries came from behind as Orcs encircled the defenders and started climbing over the wagons. The inexperienced servants, wielding their spears were knocked aside as several Orcs penetrated the circle. The Clerics inside responded with their maces and beat down the rampaging Orcs. Now the Clerics formed the rear defense of the circle, there would be very little casting from them now. I swung my short sword as best I knew how, more often than not as a deflecting blow from spear or sword. Sullairia was one of the few who could remain casting. Her healing was strengthening the delicate shell of the circle from fatigue and dropping morale. The noise was so deafening. Yells, screams, grunts, the heavy clanking of metal, but through all that, the sound of soft flesh ripping and tearing was clear in my ears. A spear went past my defenses and tore into my thigh. I screamed and collapsed under the intense pain. The Orc who stabbed me stood over me now, with many more piling up behind him to take advantage of the new hole in the defensive line. 
<br><br>
The Paladins to either side of me moved quickly to seal the hole. They fended off the attackers but their backs were to the Orc inside the circle. I was clutching my leg with both hands; I don't know where my sword was. The Orc hefted his spear above his head, then Sullairia swung here mace and struck him in the temple. The Orc's scream was short as he toppled over sideways. Sullairia looked at my bleeding wound and closed her eyes as she cast. My leg was still in agony, but the bleeding had stopped. Someone was shouting orders, but I could not hear over the din. I tried to stand to test my leg, but the pain wouldn't allow me to get past a kneel. I looked around frantically for my sword. It was lying nearby, but the stretch to reach it was at the threshold of what I could endure. More commands were shouted and people were shifting positions in the circle. I redoubled my efforts to stand; Sullairia took my arm and pulled me up on to my feet. I was hunched over, but supporting my own weight now. Then I was struck from behind. A powerful bash sent me crashing to the ground. I was face down in the red mud, which I realized was the spilt blood of the dead and wounded, then my vision faded away.
