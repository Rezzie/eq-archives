Ohhhh this is a tough one, but if I absolutely have to choose one article I liked best it would be Razor's "<a href="../Issue20/wife.htm">How to Geektify Your Wife 101</a>".  My husband, (yes I am female!  Onnie is a female NAME! &lt;g&gt;), has absolutely no clue about computers and much less interests in computer games.  A good example of his lack of knowledge would be, he thinks I have a talent for them.  Sure I can get around in DOS, but outside of knowing that if I get to do a /del windowtree it's party time, I know very little compared to REAL puter people.
<br><br>
Razor's article had me rolling and I had to drag my Hubby in to read it.  I told him he was strong enough to take the plunge, to become literate enough that he to could find the control panel by double clicking on My Computer instead of doing that awful Start/Settings/Control Panel.  I even let my hopes soar that we, together, could overcome his delusion of my computer talents by him learning the difference between connecting to your ISP and your Web Browser.  In fact I flattered myself that one day he would not say to me "So how do I run the Internet program?"  Honestly, I had given up all hope until I read Razor's article, which breathed life again into my battle with the Hubby.
<br><br>
A favorite piece of work that I personally did would be the first half of <a href="../Issue100/nalixa.htm">Nalixa's Journal</a>.   Her Journal was to give the players in EQ a different look on the gnolls position in that part of the world.  Blackburrow not being just a dungeon that Verant stuck right there for the barbs and humans to go get some levels, but a reason behind its location.  I have tons of stories in my head, but never seem to be able to get them out and finished. With her story for the first time I couldn't keep up trying to write it.  She took on a life of her own and I felt almost like I was taking dictation from my boss.  I have heard writers speak of their characters standing over their shoulder telling them what to write, but had never experienced it first hand.  In fact I would like to thank all of those who made it possible for me to do so:
<br><br>
Oggy: For being up early on a Saturday morning and saying on ICQ "Read this, I am all over the place here".  Also for being a great evil editor and editing the whole thing for me.  My Hubby: For editing some of it when I was going cross-eyed.  Sony: For making my computer.
Verant: For making the game.  Wireweb: For being my ISP.  Morgaelin: For liking what I wrote and finally....
<br><br>
Absor: because he's kept EQX running/alive all this time more ways than I can count and also because..... the brownie points won't hurt me for mentioning him.
