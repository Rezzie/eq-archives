This is in regards to the Straylight Saga happening on the realm known as 
Rallos Zek.  My name is Kallystra and many of you may know me from my 
weekly articles in this very site.  I am also a participant of the 
Straylight Saga on Rallos Zek and I am the child in question who was (and 
still is) the Daughter of Innoruuk (although the storyline in this has yet 
to show that).  Let me basically tell what happened before, during, and 
after this issue.  I have been roleplaying Kallystra, child of Mahlyce and 
Daughter of Innoruuk for some time.  As far as any of us knew on RZ.com 
(ralloszek.com), I was the only "Daughter" of Innoruuk, GM or playerrun 
(although you will find quite a few sons) on any server.  The storyline has 
been running a long time and is part of the plot of the Straylight 
Sage.  One night, I entered Neriak to come face to face with Lanys T'Vyl (a 
GM) who called herself the Avatar of Hate and the Daughter of Innoruuk and 
called me a falsechild.  I roleplayed my part against her, trying to make 
her prove that she is who she claims to be by asking her to recite the 
Litany of Birth, the Litany of Purpose, or atleast the Commandments of 
Innoruuk.  We were having a pretty good time even though I was killed a few 
times by "The Power of the Gods" even though I had never laid a hand on 
her.  Finally, she attacked one of the Blood Coven members (a guild of 
Teir'Dal sisters dedicated to the Father and our Queen).  I could not take 
such blasphemy and stood between them.  I was attacked and then when I 
called her a falsehood because she couldn't even state the Commandments, I 
was squelched (made so I could not talk in /say, /shout, /guildsay, /g) 
which I felt an abuse of power for I had roleplayed the entire time.  I 
emailed Brad and crew and never received a response.  Anyhow, the next time 
I faced Lanys T'Vyl, we mended our differences for the betterment of those 
that really mattered, the players.  We now try and work together to bring 
the Teir'Dal community closer.  When I see her, I acknowledge her as the 
Avatar of Hate and my sister and she acknowledges me as her sister and a 
Daughter of Innoruuk.  There have been a few GM-driven quests and I have 
stood beside her and the others to help accomplish these things.  I am very 
pleased with the way Verant is FINALLY trying to do more than just simple 
quests and trying to get an ongoing storyline.  I also foresee Verant 
trying to assist more PlayerRun Quests (and I don't just mean those that 
are running to kill Lady Vox) and Storylines.  It took them awhile to see 
things were not as they promised but are working hard to fix that.  I have 
a few suggestions to help bring Verant and the Roleplaying Community closer 
together and have emailed them to Mr. Butler and Brad but never received a 
response.  So, all in all, I believe the "Daughter of Innoruuk" plot that 
was "borrowed" from the Straylight Saga storyline was a low blow (they 
could of atleast asked) but then again, I am flattered they liked the 
idea.  I am even happier that the GMs and Guides on Rallos Zek are working 
to better the relations between Roleplayers and them and not just "squelch" 
us anymore  =)

I just read your article about game playing and put downs.   In a word BRAVO!  I am a 48 year old retired police Sgt. in Montana.  I served in the US Army and 22 years on a local police force.  I fly airplanes, ride horses, hike and am considered, by those who think they know me, a conservative... in other words a non-geek by anyone's standards... and to be retired at age 48 hardly a loser.  Yet I love playing EQ... I have attended a number of gaming Cons and enjoyed the company of most of those in attendance.  I hesitate to speak in absolutes, (life is such an ironic opponent), however I suspect that people who put others down for what they enjoy are small and somewhat envious of others enjoyment.  An old farmer (who only averaged 3000 gross a year and had almost no education, my grandfather) once gave me a bit of great wisdom.... It's your life... you live it! (I never saw a day where grandad didn't sing or smile)
<br><br>
So again BRAVO!

Hello my name is Christopher and I am going to purchase everquest as soon as I can get to the store. I fought my parents for weeks to let me get it (its my money after all) and they finnaly caved in.
<br><br>
I do not expect you to write back or anything but jsut wanted to say
this:    I find your choice of subjects in the editorials extremely good and think that you have one of the best writing styles I have ever seen. I have red some two thousand five hundred books (not exaggerating, I am a real book worm) adn I think theat you write wonderfully.
<br><br>
    I just thought that since reading your editorials gave me som much 
pleasure that at least you deserved to hear about it.  Well as Frodo said, "Namarie." (Tolkiens elvish for farewell)
<br><br>
    PS--I love Tolkien!!!!

<em>Thank you for your kind words about my work!  I enjoy hearing from anyone
that likes what I've done, and I try to keep writing so that I can become
better.  We are fortunate here at EQX to have many creative individuals -
Aklar, Absor, and Archanalia are all very talented, and I feel fortunate to
have the chance to work with them.  
<br><br>
I, too, am a bookworm (I had no TV in my house as a child) and I think that
has helped my writing immensely.  Keep reading, it makes homework go by
easier, too!
