  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dynamic Roleplaying</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I 
  couldn’t agree more with Absor’s editorial regarding the Verant sponsored events. 
  “Finally!” I say, but also I’m inclined to say, “It’s a start, not the finish 
  line.” Planned events are just that, planned events. I, like many others, would 
  like to see an RPG based on a more dynamic model. Of course, be forewarned, 
  I’m a roleplayer in a pretty big way so many of my suggestions don’t match up 
  with the MMORPG status quo.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I 
  wrote a letter to the editor a while back (<a href="../Issue23/letters.htm">Issue 
  #23</a>) in which I stated that the players were the key element in a successful 
  online RPG. That is, a game where consistent and plot moving role-playing is 
  taking place. I stated that it would essentially be the player's responsibility 
  to fuel, and in a sense, monitor, the consistency of 'roles' that are being 
  played.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There 
  will never be a coded way to monitor this activity. Code may assist in determining 
  improper 'roles' or behavior that is 100% inconsistent with the proposed virtual 
  environment, but it will never be the final judge. Further, it will be quite 
  some time before we see a gaming company muster together the willpower and sheer 
  logistical genius to provide a large enough staff to monitor such activity as, 
  say a pen and paper GM might.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I’ve 
  also made the claim in the past that players must take a slightly greater interest 
  in keeping the virtual world cohesive. They must add a little extra commitment 
  for the sake of everyone's experience. It’s not enough to decide for you and 
  you alone what roleplaying is. To truly play a meaningful role it must be a 
  part of a greater community. People have a great way of getting behind a common 
  goal and forging communities.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
  same cohesive behavior takes place in online games. In EverQuest, the common 
  goal seems to be the gaining of levels and equipment. An entire vocabulary has 
  developed around this, not to mention social rules and faux paus. Spontaneously, 
  people have gathered together around that one thing they have in common and 
  made a unique community out of the thing.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> However, 
  the focus stifles what I would really call 'roleplaying'. Not many are really 
  pursuing a role beyond being themselves and not many are adding to the virtual 
  history of a fantasy world. There is a community, of course. A very complicated 
  and rewarding one at that, to be sure. There is even a history for this community, 
  though instead of being recorded in historical annals in a library in Norrath, 
  its spread out through lists of patches, communications between the dev team 
  and the players, and in real life discussion on message boards and news groups. 
  Who is a 'KS' is much more pertinent to this community than 'who murdered Guard 
  Nexxil'.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> So 
  how do you get players to recognize and focus on the fantasy world and its history 
  instead of the ‘computer gaming community’ and its, for lack of a better term, 
  OOC history? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
  is where the company comes in.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If 
  players are to truly play meaningful roles; if a true fantasy world is to blossom 
  and remain cohesive - true to its own imagined history, true to its own society, 
  the game itself has to showcase it. Rather than only giving the players a few 
  numbers in common and leaving it at that, true in-game ties need to be forged 
  and put into use. Its not enough to throw two thousand people into a room and 
  say "Here’s a brief history, here’s a fantasy 'world', now play the game," and 
  watch from afar as they mill about, only interjecting to roll the dice for them 
  a few times. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Things 
  need to happen in game that inspire and encourage roles that are consistent 
  with the envisioned world. Some suggestions which I think would help the cause:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>One 
  character</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This 
  isn’t simply to stop 'twinking' or 'mule' characters. It’s to enforce accountability. 
  Its to make players actually invest something in their characters and to avoid 
  out of character temptations. Given only one persona from which to choose on 
  an account, people would be much more prudent in their choice of role and their 
  own actions.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Temptations 
  include mule characters who collect or create items the main character cannot, 
  which erodes the community. They also include twinking, which erodes community 
  (relying on others) and even the overall balance of power in a game. Temptations 
  also include 'gravy train' connections wherein those who consider themselves 
  roleplaying make new characters and justify muling or twinking through some 
  story of how their new character is 'related' to the old. In any case, the true 
  answer is they are simply doing it to get ahead statistically and only in a 
  secondary way (if at all) to support a chosen role.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Another 
  possible bonus stemming from having a single character per account, the grief 
  player who lives to simply make other players miserable would be easily singled 
  out. Quite possibly, what happens in real life to such individuals would happen 
  in game: shunned, they would only be able to carry the behavior so far until 
  everyone was on to them. At some point everyone would be able to tie 'moron' 
  with their persona and avoid them like the plague or justly pursue them to extinction. 
  The only solution for the grief player would be to start a new persona and again 
  take the time to develop a new character. In short, the grief players would 
  only inhabit the lower rung of the power scale. True, some may persevere despite 
  the negatives of being an easily recognizable sociopath, however, its my opinion 
  that those that did would in a sense be taking on an interesting antagonistic 
  role that might be drawn into the game's society.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>In 
  Game Guilds</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Completely 
  OOC entities shouldn’t be given presence in the world. Clan Zerg_Brood from 
  Starcraft shouldn’t be encouraged to merely transport players into the environment 
  and just add the game to a long list of other games they have a presence in. 
  Guilds should be inextricably tied to the true history of the virtual world. 
  The developers should create compelling in-character guilds all tied together 
  by virtue of the game world's complex history which players can join and achieve 
  rank in. I think a virtual world is severely compromised with the more things 
  that are completely out side of its scope that it is forced to represent. Now 
  this doesn’t mean that Clan Zerg_Brood couldn’t decide to all join some historically 
  established guild and -in character- dominate that guild. In fact, if done properly, 
  the organization and effort put forth could only add to the experience for everyone. 
  Wouldn’t being a member of “The Outriders of Karana” (Aradune’s own organization) 
  be infinitely more interesting and supportive of the in-character history than 
  to be a member of Player Guild #20300? Not to say players themselves can’t make 
  some excellent in-character guilds that are grounded in and add to the virtual 
  history; but it’s incredibly rare.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Player 
  Relations</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> No, 
  not PR or tech support, but relations as in familial relations. Wouldn’t it 
  be interesting to be another player's father, mother, daughter, or son? We've 
  seen in some games weddings between characters which have a sort of true bond 
  represented in game and in character. I think taking this a step further and 
  assigning family trees on character creation would be quite interesting. Sure, 
  there's probably a fifty-fifty chance that it evolves into chaos or that people 
  take it seriously and develop true 'clan' like ties from it.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Less 
  NPCs in positions of societal importance</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
  EverQuest my Dark Elven Cleric’s guildmaster lost my interest when I discovered 
  his vocabulary was limited to three sentences. I knew he could never appreciate 
  the fact that I groveled before him, or that I made sure to remove all weapons 
  before entering the house of my god. But had there been flesh and blood behind 
  that visage, wouldn’t it have been more interesting? Which leads to my next 
  suggestion:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Character 
  Careers</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I 
  want to see player's run the virtual world. I don’t want to see automated traders 
  and money machines. I mean all that does is make sure the game retains that 
  'fast food' sort of imagery. No substance underlying players who are simply 
  running to the ATM and back after 'camping a spawn'. I’ve played in enough games 
  to know that there are players for every role. I guarantee there are a fair 
  number of people who would enjoy spending the majority of their time running 
  the Smith in Freeport or tending bar at the Blind Fish in Neriak. Some people 
  like nothing more than to sit quietly and build trade skills and ply their wares. 
  Perhaps players could state their character goals at the games beginning. Before 
  choosing their profession (or class) they simply select the path which best 
  suits their envisioned character. A tradesman, an adventurer, an entertainer, 
  or maybe a bureaucrat (head of a guild or mayor of a town) A -role-; a true 
  one which has meaning to the world beyond the all too trite 'my sword is bigger 
  than yours'. Players should be able to change these roles in the course of play, 
  of course. Though the one they choose should make up the bulk of the players 
  true skills.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Not 
  to say NPCs have no place. But they should be simply used as tools, period. 
  The real action, the real dynamics are with the players. They are alive and 
  breathing and the only way of producing anything which resembles such. NPCs 
  could be guards controlled by the PC captain of the guard; they could be criers 
  in employ of the PC Mayor or apprentices to run the PC's shop when he’s not 
  online or out of the office. They shouldn’t be the sole maintainer’s of the 
  game’s history or the sole source of that histories action and change.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>No 
  planned events</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Logging 
  on should be the event. The world should be interesting enough and vibrant enough 
  that every session is an event. This is the benefit of having players as the 
  centerpiece. No need for a GM to log on as 'random 10,000 hit point bad guy_0001' 
  that can live long enough to spout out some slightly relevant story and then 
  slay everything they walk into. The players themselves, if actually drawn into 
  the virtual world and its history, would provide this. Further, players who 
  just aren’t lucky enough to be on at the 'right time' won’t feel slighted, for 
  really anytime should potentially be full of intrigue and an interesting event.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Another 
  point, people are clamoring for online worlds to be dynamic then sitting on 
  their hands! How can it be dynamic when the biggest portion of most online “RPG”s 
  is devoted to rout, static behavior?! Of course, it only helps when the game 
  producers recognize this as well and provide ways that players can be empowered 
  to manipulate and involve themselves directly with the world.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Time</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This 
  is the biggest issue perhaps. Players would log on and find massive changes 
  each time. Perhaps the Freeport smith logs on and finds he’s been out of goods 
  for the past real time week. Maybe the Dark Elven commander of the Indigo Brotherhood 
  logs on to find Neriak has been overrun by Halflings and his watch slaughtered. 
  True, there would be large gaps as, for obvious reasons, players will always 
  log on at different times. It may even be the case that players take advantage 
  of this; the player members of the Halfling Leatherfoots organizing their raid 
  during hours they know a large chunk of the Indigo Brotherhood guild can’t be 
  online to help defend the city. Sure, it’s a potentially enormous stumbling 
  block in such a dynamic, player-centric game, but well, it does definitely insure 
  the game is indeed dynamic as per request. Major events should be logged each 
  day and given to players to peruse as the game loads or in a way similar to 
  the patch message’s of EverQuest so every player is kept up to speed on the 
  evolving state of the game. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
  that’s my thoughts on this whole phenomenon of MMORPG’s and a few ways (of the 
  hundred or so I can think of!) that I think they could be improved. Well not 
  only improved but actually worthy of that little ‘RPG’ tag.</font></p>
