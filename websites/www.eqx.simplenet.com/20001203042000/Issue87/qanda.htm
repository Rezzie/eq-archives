<B>Please Note:</B> EverQuest Express is not the official voice of Verant
Interactive, makers of EverQuest. We cannot answer questions about payment 
methods, hardware requirements (i.e. video cards), or technical details about 
the game. This Q&A is meant to cover gameplay issues only. Thank you for 
understanding.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you give a summary of which items in the game can be used as food or drink and also if there's a difference in nourishment between the things.  For instance, is a loaf of bread more wholesome than cookies?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm what could be more wholesome than cookies?  I can't even imagine that possibility.  In answer to your question, I confess I don't know the answer and haven't searched it out.  I usually buy the cheapest food item around if I can't scrounge dinner from a friendly ranger.  It's my understanding that some of the magical  food items in the game do last longer than purchased ones, but I'm don't have any specific examples of that.  One thing I do know is that I feel a LOT thirstier singing in the desert than crooning in the cool forests, but since adventures and songs are what I love, studying the clock to find out if there is a real difference in liquid refreshment use rates is something I would recommend for others more scientifically inclined.  If a food or water item is meant to be consumed, it usually will be taken from your inventory and used effortlessly.  However, there are some exceptions like alcohol which is drinkable only by right clicking on the beverage of choice in your inventory.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a Lore item?  What does one do with it?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lore items are items, often magical, that have a story behind them.  I have heard that at some point, through spells or songs or plain old game information, the story or "lore" of each item will become available.  In the meantime, don't forget that players can only have one of each type of lore item.  Should you accidentally pick up a duplicate of a lore item you possess, one of them will disappear from inventory, your backpack or the bank if you have it stashed there.  Also, another small word of caution:  lore items have been known to disappear on logins and when a bag that contains them is dropped.  There isn't a lot you can do to prevent it but making sure your inventory is clear enough so that nothing will drop when you trade is an excellent idea.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the game going to deal with inflation?  New money and items are introduced into the world from dead MOBs every day.  Given that the amount of players on any one server is limited, I can imagine a time when players will be able to buy rare items (at least they are rare now) quite cheaply because there would be so many of them in the economy.  This wouldn't be good.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there have been quite a few posts on inflation from the developers over time and, unfortunately, this bard can't remember what they said except that a careful watch would be kept and if an increase in the quantity of a previously rare item seemed to upset the game balance, the item would be tweaked or removed.   The economy is, I believe, meant to allow for inflationary cycles and it is expected and planned for that some rarer items will become more common and cheaper as long as game balance is not upset.   I don't think the number of players on any one server is limited, however, in the way you indicated.  People do come and go from the game, move to other servers and start new characters so that a changing population is a dynamic force in the economy along with the number of items obtained.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just wondering, what is the average price of a Blackened Iron Crown in Qeynos?  I have been asking around and no one knows, or they won't tell me.  Thanks!
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated above, the economy in Norrath is changing constantly.  Average prices for items are difficult to determine because it really depends on the seller's financial need, the availability of the item at a given time, and the number of people who wish to buy it.  Also, sometimes higher level players see lower levels in desperate need and sell an item at a fraction of what it would bring from the more affluent.   I realize that this answer won't save you from a price gouger (yes they do exist!), but if I needed to buy an item and saw one for sale, I'd not depend on an "average" price, but probably would start asking my groupmates what they thought of the deal.  If no one in the group knew, I'd then most likely start asking around to those in my class who might have already been through the process of buying the item, telling them I'd appreciate some advice so I don't make a dreadful mistake.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to clarify information on the Priest of Discord on the PVP teams servers.  At the start of the PVP teams, you are pvp+ to opposing teams.  If you turn in your book to Priest of Discord you become pvp- to everyone, you can not kill or be killed by anyone and no changing back to pvp+ teams so if you want to turn your book in, why play on a team server?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, let's start from the beginning here.  If you start a character on a racewar server you actually do not carry a +pvp flag; the code is set up to allow you to kill only opposing races.  However, if you turn in your book to the Priest of Discord, you will be flagged as a +pvp player subject to the same effects as on a regular server, i.e., only others who similarly are +pvp flagged can heal you or cast beneficial spells on you.  You can, however, both kill and be killed with the +pvp flag on.  (How do I know?  I created a character, did the quest and in a quick test was killed very promptly.)   You need to be aware that the Priest of Discord quest on the racewar servers is essentially a bug.  It shouldn't be there.  (Reminder: Race War servers are considered to be in beta.)   Due to this "bug", the GMs on the racewar servers will return you to the proper -pvp flag if you petition and request it.   If a GM is online, petition and ask for assistance.  If you don't see a GM online, petition and ask a guide to help you get in touch with one as soon as possible.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just wondering if you could clear up the looting on PVP servers?  I have been told that the one who inflicts the most damage gets the loot.  But personal experience tells me that it's the one who delivers the death blow.  Also when you use DOT spells and a pet and it takes more damage than your DD spells and attacks, then you also don't get to loot since you didn't deal the most damage.  What's up?  What's the real story here?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, first I went to visit a pvp server and asked the looting question via petition just to make sure I had the answer right.  (Senior guides, guides and GM's can answer game questions that don't affect the "mystery" of the game.)  The answer I received from a Senior Guide was that whoever inflicts the most damage does get the right to loot, and the death blow is not the deciding criterion.   The opposite is true, however, in answer to your question on what is up with DOT spells and pet damage.   The way it was explained to me is that there is a bug in the game that currently will allow no one to loot if the pet or the DOT spell makes the killing blow no matter who did the most damage.  (Ouch!)
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I often wonder about how much experience I am getting for each kill.  If a mob cons red does it give more exp than a blue one?  If so, does a sand giant that cons red give more experience than a sand scarab that also cons red?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to check the experience an npc is giving you, watch your bubblemeter as you fight and you can gain a fair idea of your progress and what kind of experience you are getting from the monsters you fight.  In general, a red mob will give more experience than a blue one.  However, assuming both the scarab and the sand giant of your example conned red to you or your group the answer to your question is a lot more complicated.  If you were soloing, chances are pretty good that the scarab would kill you more slowly than the sand giant stomping on your head, but that without assistance from others, you would die (depending on your equipment of course).  In a group where the scarab and giant conned red to all the members, the story would be similar:  you might beat the scarab or only suffer a death or two but the giant would eat your group for lunch before you could yell "SG"!  In that case you'd get more experience from the red scarab (if you survived) than from the loss of experience with the sand giant deaths.  If, however, both monsters conned red to you or your group (assuming all members of the group to be within experience range of each other), but you were being twinked and  somehow miraculously could kill both monsters, you would get more experience from the high level giant than the lower level scarab.  Read the question below for some more discussion on this.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering if things that conned red would give more experience than things that conned yellow.  When fighting at unrest at level 19, I found that dry bone skeletons would give much more experience than a skeletal monk, but the monk is higher?  Is this true, and why would they make it like that if a group of 6 can easily take down things much higher than the group's levels?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, whether you are soloing or in a group, a mob or npc that cons red is going to be a lot harder to kill than one that cons yellow and it will give more experience.  However, that is, from what I can tell, only a "general" answer and there will be exceptions.  Remember, the manual in your EQ folder says when you "con" an npc, the "text of the messages gives an indicator of the relative danger of the monster and the color of the text represents the relative amount of experience points you will gain by killing it."  The manual goes on to say that with a green con, for instance, you will get no experience if you kill the monster.  However, that's not entirely so, as I have killed green monsters that are relatively more dangerous than other green monsters and have received experience for it.   I've also heard a few cries of frustration when a blue or green conning monster wipes an area clean of supposedly higher level players.   Wasn't there some English author who made comments equating consistency with boredom?  
<br><br>
My answer to the second part of your question is just a thought on the process as I don't know the why's of the choices made by the developers for experience for groups:   A group of 6 may or may not easily take down a mob or npc that cons red to its members.  It will depend on the class of the monster and its level (a red con can encompass a LOT of levels); the classes in the group; each person's level, skills and equipment; the strategy the group chooses to use in attacking the monster; and to some extent it will depend on the roll of the dice.    
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a question but more of an answer to the full group bonus thing.  About a month ago EQVault posted a messageboard clipping from Brad McQuaig (or some bigwig from Verant, but definitely from Verant) saying that there is NO bonus for having a full party.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your comment.  I searched online for such a message from Brad McQuaid or someone else from Verant and could find none that said there was no bonus for a full party.  Of course, I couldn't find one saying there WAS a bonus either!  I've ordered my cloak and dagger costume to appropriately continue an investigation.   In the meantime I'm sticking to my secret informant's comments that grouping brings more than social benefits.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As a player that just joined the race war servers, I must say that these have brought the fun back to the game.  My question, and this may be looking a bit down the road, is this.  What is going to happen to the team setup when the expansion pack comes out?  With thirteen races there will be no way to split it evenly along racial lines.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoting a friend who always seems to have the perfect answer, "I was wondering that myself!"  If anyone out there in EQ land has a clue, let me know.  Or we could have a "crystal ball" contest to see if anyone figures out ahead of time how the races will be redivided.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I love EQX!!  I have a question as to which boards y'all read.  I can't find one I really like and can't seem to find the ones that people post to regularly.  I would appreciate the help.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly when I hear people ask about Everquest related boards, I hear others referring them to the <a href="http://www.everquest.com">official Everquest website</a> (www.everquest.com), to <a href="http://www.eqvault.com">EQ Vault</a> at www.eqvault.com and to <a href="http://eq.stratics.com">Stratics</a> at eq.stratics.com.  You will find all of these sites to be a good start with additional links being offered by them if you want to search more.  My personal favorite of course is EQ Express (*smiles broadly*) but to be fair, there are a lot of sites out there based on guilds, classes and other areas of specific interest that  you may enjoy visiting.   Hope this helps some.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that everyone has ideas for EQ (just read a message board once), but what if you had an idea (a good one at that) that has just not come up?  What is the best way to get that idea out there and into listening range of Verant?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm, I've been playing in Norrath now for over a year and have found that for the most part, assuming I don't try to get an idea across when all servers on CerfNet have just gone down, Verant is always ready and willing to listen to constructive ideas, especially new ones.  There are several ways to send your ideas in.  First, you can petition your idea to a guide or GM.  The guides can then log your feedback for Verant.  You also have the option of using the /feedback command in game.  If you choose to do this, make sure you are in a safe place while you type your idea as you will not be able to see or hear what is going on around you as you do a feedback.  You also can write to <a href="mailto:eqfeedback@verant.com">eqfeedback@verant.com</a> or to <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a> asking that your idea be forwarded to the appropriate team.   If you aren't sure where to direct your idea, another possibility is to ask a guide or GM for advice.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reply to the begging question in Issue #86.    In Phase 4 Beta, one of my friends told me that one of his friends (yes, a long line of 'friends") actually begged an entire platinum off of someone!  But, mind you, his skill had to be 150+ or so, and this was Phase 4 Beta.  Also, I have realized not to beg off of guards.  (I myself beg from time to time to see if this plat-per-beg is true).  One time I was sitting at T2 in West Karanas and begged from Pryde (I think) and he killed me.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I hear 2 Platinum?  Thanks very much for the update on begging.    I'm very curious now whether anyone has gotten anything but coin and whether there is someone out there who can confirm the one plat begging success.
<br><br>

<em><b>Nep's Notes:</b>   Thanks to all who wrote in about the hot keys -- solutions and new questions both!  I will try to have either a column or an article soon using the combined knowledge of Oghma's earlier column on hot keys, the information in issue #86 and the information you have sent in.  Sorry it isn't here but it's going to take me a bit of time.  In the meantime, if you have other hotkey solutions or keyboard shortcuts that work well for you, please let us know and let's see if we can help make the keyboard part of playing easier for us all.   Also, I apologize for the premature comment on the /yell command.  It appears it was in the game for a little and had a problem so has been temporarily removed.  Let's hope it's back soon.</em>
