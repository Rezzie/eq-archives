"They don't put them in the systems because they want to make sure you get
one that's fast enough for your liking."  He answers.
<br><br>
"I recommend this fifty-six kilobyte USR.  It's the fastest connection you
can get on the Internet today, and Windows 95 really likes it." He says as
he nods his head in agreement with himself.
<br><br>
"So I will never wait too long to view world wild web pictures on the
Internet?" I question.
<br><br>
"No way.  You will never have to wait for anything with this screamer."
He says as he looks at his watch.

"Great.  I don't want to wait.  That's for sure!" I say.
<br><br>
"As a matter of fact this computer outran just about every computer on the
market.  I just read in Computer Shopper that out of the one hundred systems
they tested, this computer system had the fastest benchmarks." He gloated.
<br><br>
I look at the label on the computer.  It's one of those prefab white cases
that have a notch so that system builders can add their logo sticker to the
case.  The logo read "Intel Fast", leading you to believe this was an Intel
made computer I guess.  For that matter since when did Computer Shopper start
rating computers?

I see my son returning with his purchase in hand.  I decide to make my
closing.  
<br><br>
"It appears that Intel's driver breaks down large disk read and write
requests such as 8K, 16K, 32K, and 64K issued from an application program
into smaller 4K blocks, and sets a flag on the requests to ensure that all
4K blocks are cacheable by Windows' disk cache. The driver should set a
caching flag even if the application requested that the particular disk
date not be cached. Have you tested this computer with Winstone and WinBench
for proper operation, and can you provide me with some documentation?" I say
with a smile.
