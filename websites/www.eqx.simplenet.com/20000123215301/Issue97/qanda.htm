<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can ogre warriors train in Neriak, the dark elf city?
<br>
Dohrum
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that gnomes always give definite maybe answers?  I did chat with a globetrotting cutie with pointy ears and he said he thought that ogres could train in Neriak.  Quite honestly, I'd leave everything in a safe spot (like another city's bank) and test it out just to make sure, but that little fellow usually knows what he's talking about so let's hope you can find your guild without loss of life.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can you boost your research skill. I just hit level 16 and research is one can do at this level, at least for a wizard that is.  I have bought a lexicon and a concordance of research. But when I try to combine stuff in my concordance all attempts will fail. I have to admit I haven't put one skill in research yet. But a friend of mine has and he stumbles upon the same problem. Another friend just keep saying just put the runes in the lexicon and voila. You got a spell. For now is it oke, but I don't want to ruin expensive runes for the later spell. So I am searching for a way to boost up my research skill. How can this be done? 
<br>
Chamtaliontri
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To start, it is an excellent idea to put at least one practice point into research to begin your skill practice.  Some people choose to put more practice points in for a faster boost, often as many as 15 points or about 3 levels of training, but that's up to you.  In addition, you might wish to experiment with equipment that adds to your wisdom and/or intelligence as these may influence your success rate.  My Pillars of Knowledge, the cleric and the ranger, both tell me that there are quest items to make practice runes which will save some of your precious platinum for later spells.  Finally, you can continue to attempt to make spells with runes to increase your skill.  Hope this helps!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are the Ogre Shadowknights called Greenbloods? 
<br>
Kernas 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I tend to stay relatively far away from ogres, I can't attest to the truth of this statement but I have it from somewhat dubious but very amusing authority, that ogre shadowknights are called Greenbloods for the juju that runs in their veins.  I wonder if that is true?

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am dark elf magician, agnostic, level 8. My home city is Neriak, but I know people in Freeport. My question is if I kill enough orcs or do enough quests and improve my faction with Commons residents can I trade with humans??  Also if I kill orcs in east commons does it help my standing in Freeport? 
<br>
Tedward
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may think I am presenting the usual convoluted bard's explanation but in fact faction questions can lead to complex answers.  It's my understanding that if you figure out who likes who and who hates who you can eventually change your faction (not religious bias, however) with just about anyone in Norrath.  (Well, Lady Vox has been known to say that under no circumstances would she ever take tea with a bard, but that is a unique situation.)   Anyway, what you need to do first is determine which  Commons residents you might like to trade with and who they like and who they hate.  It might be necessary for you to get some help on this depending on how much they detest you at the moment.  Then you need to check the orcs or other available npcs, as well as quests, and see which ones need to be killed to affect the Commons residents in a positive way.  You should be aware that just because an npc might be a Commons resident, it is possible that they have a secret agenda and a secret faction to match so listening to their conversations is useful too.  Thus, when you ask if you can trade with humans, it will very well depend on which humans you are asking about.   As far as the orcs in East Commons, please kill every one!  They drool and hate music!  However, before you commit wholesale slaughter at this bard's suggestion, you should probably kill one orc and see which factions are affected.  Then you can go from there.  Keeping notes on all these faction matters is a really good idea.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a simple question - do magic boots allow you to kick magic creatures, or only certain boots, and if only certain boots which ones? Thanks 
<br>
Hafgan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a simple answer for you!  Yes!  Magic boots will allow you to kick magic creatures.  There apparently are not too many of these kinds of boots in the game but take heart as magical attack becomes available somewhere in the mid-twenties to thirties levels for monks at least.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the best race for a Paladin?
<br>
Zoltan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-elves are best for nearly everything, naturally, but apparently there is something in our nature which prevents us from being accepted as paladins.   Thus I had to look beyond those of my own kind to choose which race makes the best paladins.  From what the Pillars of Knowledge say, dwarves excel at paladinning because of their higher strength and decent wisdom.  There is a small experience penalty for non-human races, but in this instance it's not a big factor.  That being said and although dwarves are adorable, there is something so elegant about high elf paladins that I can see a certain advantage to choosing  glamour rather than brawn.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard from various sources that Elven Wine is, indeed, an alcohol you can make. From these sources, the most common ingredients are:  Wine Yeast, Foraged Berries, Bottle, and Morning Dew  I have searched all over... nobody has ever seen where it would be for sale. I've also tried foraging in all of the most obvious zones (Greater/Lesser Fay, Butcherblock, Commons, Misty Thicket, Karanas, etc.). My attempts, however, were to no avail. My question, now, is where would I find such item? Is it a quest, or have I been looking in the wrong places? Perhaps it hasn't been implemented to the game yet, or could it be that it was merely translated wrong from whichever book the recipe was found in? If you can't give away the whole answer, at least give me a hint, as I've been trying to make Elven Wine (my favorite) for quite some time.  
<br>
Edicius - E'Ci Server
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I have searched the world on your behalf and then retraced my steps over and over, trying to find some hint of mountain, err no uh, morning dew and finding nothing but a deluge of rain.  From what I have been able to find out, your recipe is correct but if morning dew is to be found, the secret of its whereabouts is closely held.  One helpful person did tell me that he thought he might have seen morning dew somewhere in the Karanas but it was only a dim memory with no further details.  For now you may have to subsist on the Kelethin version of elven wine, but if you ever come across morning dew, please let me know.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know this?  Qeynos spelled backwards is sonyeq :)  Just in case anybody did not know that :)   
<br>
Aalon
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep I did know!   My guess is that others will enjoy your discovery  so thanks for writing.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings, I was created to see if we can swim across the ocean of tears till Freeport. Here is my story:  While waiting for the boat to come, I decided to work my swimming and so I got to 3. The boat came, got on it and got ready. As soon as the boat zoned to the ocean of tears, I jumped off swimming to west, I went on swimming, swimming, swimming, and I got exhausted, but still I continued till I was fed up, that is after 15 minutes and after I got my swimming to 10. After all this time I was still in the ocean of tears, so I must assume, that you cannot swim to Freeport :(. Just for the record, I did not encounter any sea creature in this ocean, not even a single fish nor vegetation, strange it is indeed. Trolly yours
<br>
Tarabish, dead Paladin of Marr
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, it seems like you were exceptionally lucky about the creatures you did not encounter in the Ocean of Tears and I am glad your experiment went off without a sea monster prematurely ending it.  From the dark tales I have heard told over campfires, I think sweet fortune was with you.  Your story is well taken, however, and thank you for trying swimming out and letting us know.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to correct you on your answer in issue #95 on the /consent loot.  If a character has no drop items on them the /consent command does not let another character loot these items. I have had this experience about a week ago and was unable to loot the no-drop items for my friend.  So unless this has changed with one of the recent (last three) patches it is not possible to loot the no-drops with the /consent command.  As for the lore items you were correct in a duplicate item disappearing.
<br>
Sir Haladen Knight Of Truth Brell Seriliss  May the Marr twins be with you
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing in on this with the correction.  Even if you cannot loot no-drop items, it is possible, when the corpse is in a particularly inconvenient place, to at least get consent from your friend and /corpse the body to a safer spot awaiting the owner's arrival.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Exibarious asked a question regarding the value of the different foods available in Norrath, to which you replied that essentially there was no difference.  I would hate to disagree with your fine column, but I think you will find that while it is true that all foods and drink provide nourishment for the same length of time, it is the value of that nourishment which varies.  Keep an close eye on your stamina bar and you will see what I mean.  As a wizard I can quite happily survive on muffins and milk, but I wouldn't advise it for warriors.  And milk on one of those long boat trips will definitely make you feel more than a little queasy. 
<br>
Lyrren
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I think the relationship between milk and sea queasiness makes perfect sense and I always make a point of taking along some other beverages for ocean voyages.  However, from what I can learn, warriors can manage quite well on muffins and milk as I have been assured that all food products in Norrath do have the same value, at least for now.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't so much a question but a tip. Being a long time Tribes player I have spent a long time revamping my keyboard for playing and this is something I have found works very very well and will really help you out especially when fighting on the run. Revamp the following: "Target nearest NPC" to Keypad Enter; "Autoattack" to Keypad 0; "Consider" to Keypad +; "Target nearest PC" to Keypad .  This setup allows for rapid target acquire and attack also you can keep one hand on the hotkeys and really get a quick blast off.    Another simple tip is to remap "open" to your now empty space bar-- it is just a lot easier to run away like that.  For those of you who like the mouselook, go ahead and put your "User Defined's" into keypads 1,2,4,5,7,and 8 then forward at keypad 9 and backward at keypad 3 this will allow everything at one place but will take a while to get used to.  Center look at keypad six is good with this setup. It may be a lot to swallow but it can really save some time and every second counts.   Also once you get used to it you will be sure to be the fastest on the draw in those places where engaging first counts. 
<br>
Brakiss, drinking lots, fighting less, but always loving more.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I follow you on this and it's a good example how there is a fair amount of flexibility in setting up your keyboard to match your personal style of playing.  Thanks for writing.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the "best question ever" in issue 96, my question is "Why do they let people loot currency on the RZ, TZ, and VZ servers?"  A newbie may have just been on his way to shop, when some KewlDOOD comes up and kills him just for his money.  Keep the 1-item loot, but let them keep their money!
<br>
Kiratesl
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing.  My understanding is that both TZ and VZ are still in beta and welcoming comments on how well the looting system is working.  Since I don't know if anyone from Verant reads my bardish answers, it might also be worth while to offer this feedback by mailing eqfeedback@verant.com or petitioning a guide on your pvp server and asking that your idea be given as feedback.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello yet again!  Love EQX and love to send in questions!  My question this week is for all those out there who submit petitions to EQ/Verant/989/whoever in the hopes of changing the game in whatever way.  What is the proper procedure for such (if there is any) and what successes have there been (if any) from petitions?  I ask, because I would love to start one for my second skill (Baking) in order to make the various foods actually have different effects rather than simply different prices.  (The last issue noted that all foods have same benefit, so buy the cheapest.)  I'd love to see a version of chicken soup that temporarily speeds healing, or outright adds a few HP back upon consumption.  How about high-endurance bars for stamina or STR bonuses.  9Short, maybe 30 secs or so.)  Why aren't Iron Rations more like modern military MRE's chock full of over 2000 calories for the field soldier, giving him her extra energy for battles.  How about tomato soup to heal the effects of poison faster?  (Or borscht to induce vomiting for the same effect ;-)  Would it be a waste of time to even propose such, or is it worth it?  Thanks!

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's lovely to hear from you again.  Here's what it looks like to me -- ever since beta, Verant has listened constantly to a flow of ideas from players.  Lots of times, because of the enormous quantities of feedback, players would think that their ideas had been ignored only to see them implemented weeks or months down the road.  Other times the ideas were never used.  I don't think it is ever a waste of time to try to suggest new ideas especially ones as much fun and as good for roleplay as yours.  So, try a few avenues and see what happens.  You can write to eqfeedback@verant.com as above, and you could also petition setting out your ideas.  In addition, you might try writing eqmail@verant.com and asking specifically in your mail that your ideas be forwarded to the development team and the person in charge of trade skills and products.  Even if we are still eating iron rations and muffins a year from now, I still think its worth a try.  If tomato soup is introduced, can lasagne be far behind?
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whew! 1) Regarding the "which lasts longer, milk or water?" question, I think Nep and his friends are right.  The cheapest and most cost efficient are milk and muffins.  They will get a little try, but they rack in at usually 5-6 copper each.  I usually buy 20 at a time, I even know someone who fills their entire backpack with them.  How's that for never going hungry?  :)  2) On the subject of zoning without being on a boat, I am gonna have to agree with you, Zyros, and anyone else who thinks you can zone swimming.  I mean, no offense, but where all would you go?  Would running into the apparent "zone line" when the boat goes over actually act as a "zone boundary" or wall?  That is a possible choice, but what if you go through where the boat zones.  Then there is no boundary.  That's why I think you can zone while swimming.  3) On the subject of targeting the nearest NPC, I have my "target nearest NPC" on the numpad 0.  It is really handy.  I would advise everyone to do this.... or do another one, like.... M or something.  Just so you don't reach for F8 and accidentally hit F9 or something :)  Also, the button "u", I have found out, actually targets the nearest.... object, for lack of a better word.  It targets PCs, NPCs, corpses, etc.  However it isn't as 'lenient' as F7 or F8 (meaning you have be pointed, like, RIGHT at your target to target them).... it still works.  4) On the subject of casting Identify on books.... WOW, that spell isn't actually worthless!!!  I have also heard something else: Say you're doing the Coflunk / Zarchoomi Quest in Butcherblock (I'll try not to give a "spoiler", but basically everyone knows about it).  You have to find Corflunk, get his head.  You have to find Zarchoomi, get her head.  Now, these heads look alike.  Just pick one up and cast identity.  Now, if you're a tank, like a warrior, a rogue, a monk (like me), or someone that doesn't get identify (just a guess but I only think the pure casters get it, and it's research), you pretty much have to keep them organized.  For example, I keep whoever's head I killed first to the left of the other.  Quite easy.  (I also think that there are other Ogre-Quest items that, as with most quests, you have to get someone's head.  I believe those heads look like Corflunk's and Zarchoomi's too)  5)  Wow, I'm up to five.  On tailoring, I do believe that there is also "Wu's fighting gloves" This might be what Sonoroud thought of being Glowing Silk.  All I know about this object is you have to be master in tailoring and be a brewer and hunter (or you can buy the objects).  6) On the subject of rangers, I agree whole-heartedly with Delnizz.  Also I have to add my opinion.  For you role-playing rangers out there, keep this in mind.  If nobody really sees you do it, do the druids in Surefall care?  :)  I do not know if this is true, but since there is no faction hit with killing wolves.... you can probably kill them all you want (unless of course, Cros or Holly sees you, then you're toast).  7) Who's the prettiest?  Ogres are... no wait, Trolls are.............................. just kidding.  I would say wood elves are the cutest *smiles at his female wood elven friends*.  Then second best would be your pick, Nep (half elves).  Third would be.... high elves, even though it looks like they are starving (look at a newbie female wood elves stomach, you'll see what I mean).  And then finally, fourth would have to be... dark elves.  Don't ask me why I say dark elves.  I don't think human women are that cute... I mean have you seen their faces???  8) Last one.  I think the best question would definitely be "Why the [heck] hasn't Verant actually made HOUSES yet?  Why won't they say if they are working on them??"  That one I have heard from a lot of people, mainly me :)  Well that's enough of my opinions!  Ta-ta (four weeks)!

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your long letter.  A mere (ahem) correction however: it is Nep and <b><em>her</em></b> friends please.  On your comment about swimming through the ocean zones, I am a little confused about your meaning.  However, I am sticking to my information that it is simply not possible to go from one ocean zone to another while swimming.  It is necessary to be on the boat to actually zone.  Thanks for your other comments and opinions.  I have yet to here any plans for houses but if they ever go in, Nep's cottage is gonna be beneath some big trees, near a hot  spring, and have a huge stone fireplace with instruments arranged all around.  Hmm, sounds nice.  Care for some tea?

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;At around articles 50 and 60 I think there was a tale called Man of Method by Modus Operandi, think I got it right.  I been hoping for the continuation ever since.   Is this a long delay or is it over? 
<br>
Aarorn
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I checked with our erstwhile editor (what really does erstwhile mean?) and discovered that as much as he would love to have Modus Operandi continue the story, he cannot reach him by email or bard express.  If you happen upon Modus before we do, let him know how much you liked the story.  Maybe somehow you'll find him or perhaps he will see this and find some inspiration to continue the tale.




<br><br><br>
Thanks all for writing in and remember, our 100th anniversary issue is coming up!  Perhaps you would like to send in your own work for consideration or maybe you have a question or two that you've been waiting to ask for all 100 issues.  We'd love to hear from you.
