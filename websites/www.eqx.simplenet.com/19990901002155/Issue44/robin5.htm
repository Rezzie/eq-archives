Something was wrong.
<br><br>
Call it a feeling, or a hunch, or whatever you may, but something felt 
out of place. Beldro could feel it in the core of his stomach. This had 
been too easy. The whole setup was wrong. As days went, he was not 
having a good one. First captured by these peasants, and then subjected 
to an assault from a small number of Dark Elves, lead by Priestess of Innoruk. Still, reviewing what went wrong was the best way to 
figure out how to do right, regardless of what Zass said about the past.
<br><br>
Going over the past few hours again in his mind, he came up short. Too 
many questions left unanswered for this to be an isolated incident. Dark Elves don't do three things. They don't attack when they don't have a guaranteed chance of victory. They don't attack from one side alone. And they don't attack on the Surface world close to dawn. These Dark Elves did all three.
<br><br>
Something was very wrong.
<br><br>
During the battle he and Zass had mostly sat out of it, preferring to see how it played out. It would be foolish to commit yourself to battle before you see how the forces are aligned. These Surface folk with their strange concepts of honor and 'fighting to protect your friends' seemed a very stupid thing to do. Partway into the battle they were confronted by a Drow Priestess. Rather then attack her outright, and risk getting killed by a superior force, they chose to follow her to see the extent of her forces. Zasstryn apparently decided that she posed no threat, and her corpse was currently cooling in a glade not twenty feet away. Her hate didn't save her this time.
<br><br>
"Bel, are you going to stand here 'til the cursed dawn?" As usual there was no warning when the Shadow that was Zass became solid before Beldro. There never was with him. In a race that raised stealth to colossal levels, Zass was one of the best. It was said he could find a hiding place anywhere.
<br><br>
"I am simply going over the events of the day. Just because you have an aversion to thinking doesn't mean we all do."
<br><br>
Zasstryn gave him a wry look. They both fell into the same pace, and silently walked along a night shrouded forest. In contrast to the dark forest, a small town lay on one side in the middle of a clearing and was a bastion of candle lit windows. The sun, not yet risen, cast the beginning of its crimson rays across the alabaster sky. From this distance you could hardly tell that this little village was the site of a small battle.
<br><br>
Beldro stopped and glanced at the gathering crowd on the east side of the village. Crowd? Angry mob was more like it. They had turned on the group of surface dwellers that had protected them. How very Dark Elven. Perhaps there was hope for these lesser races after all.
<br><br>
"Something is wrong here Zass. It doesn't feel right. The attack, it was all wrong. Almost as if the Dark Elves were supposed to lose."  At that, Zasstryn cocked an eyebrow questioningly. Sometimes Bel thought entirely too much.
<br><br>
Yet he had felt it too. That was the sloppiest attack he had ever seen by Dark Elven forces. Even a Dark Elven child could plan a better attack. Something was up.
<br><br>
"I know. The question is, what are we going to do about it?" Beldro just shifted the folds in his robe. He pointed towards the angry mob, "What I want to know is, what are we going to do about them?"
<br><br>
Zass smiled a chilling smile. On Zasstryn H'yonith, that only meant one thing. People were going to die.
<br><br>
This may turn out to be a good day after all.
<br><br>

<br>
Ignoring the shouts of the villagers, and the worried looks from the rest of his companions, Oghma stepped forward. He could see the fear and hatred in the eyes of those simple villagers. With good cause, he realized.  After all, this group of strangers arrive in town, free the Dark Elven prisoners, and all this coincides with the arrival of a Dark Elven raiding party.  He thought, "How did he get himself into this mess?"
<br><br>
That was an easy question to answer. Zasstryn. Where was that snake? 
During that battle he and Beldro had made themselves scarce. This was the last time he helped him out of a jam.
<br><br>
Oghma glanced at his companions. They stood firm, despite the wounds they carried from battle. Elaan looked uncertain. He was faced with two choices, neither of them good. Face mob justice or fight his way out. In life, there weren't often easy answers. Mundas, in contrast to the chaotic crowds gathering around them, was an isle of relative calm. He seemed lost in thought. Oghma wasn't sure if that was a good sign. Amlaith, stood firm, eyes never resting, hand on his spear. He knew what he had to do, Oghma was sure of it. Banner was no where to be seen.
  <br><br>
Oghma was furiously thinking of a way out when the first rock was thrown, followed by a wordless, primal roar by the crowd. Oghma acted.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
As Beldro crouched into position, he cast Zasstryn a withering look, displaying his lack of confidence with the plan. Zasstryn pretended not to notice. The plan was simple. Beldro would use some of his reputed power to create some sort of diversion, while Zass would slip into the town and start killing villagers. By the time those stupid humans realized what was going on it would already be too late. As Zasstryn slowly moved towards the village, Beldro wondered how Oghma and the rest would react to this method of extraction. Knowing Oghma, he probably had his own plan.
	<br><br>		
Oghma began to sing. Rising above the angry wordless howl of the crowd, his voice, pure and strong, entrapped many of those in the crowd. As one, they stopped and listened to this song, and the hail of rocks stopped. Mundas laughed and snapped his fingers once the song was in full swing. Elaan had his sword up high, back strait, eyes glaring. He had made his decision. None of them were prepared, however, for the explosion that was to follow.
			<br><br>
Banner paced along the side of the village, watching the crowd intently. Perhaps Oghma's song would calm the crowd enough so that there could be a peaceful resolution. He, however, had a plan of his own. As he sprang into action, he was knocked to the ground by a powerful explosion of dirt and grass.
			<br><br>
Beldro cast his spell. The explosion went off as planned. The illusion was complete. Beldro seldom had any talent in this area, since his research was mostly in the area of the living impaired. Yet occasionally he could come up with small miracles. And as for those close-minded fools that kicked him out of the Academy... he would show them. So intent was he, looking at his handiwork, that he failed to notice the Dark Elven foreguard slipping into the village.
<br><br>
The song stopped. The explosion in the clear fields on the west side of the village knocked many of the townspeople to the ground. They got up, dazed by the blast. Elaan didn't have that problem, he saw clearly what were shambling from that dark and smoking crater. Zombies. He had to act, there was no time. With a battle cry and a prayer to Elsoi Marr on his lips, he ran into battle.
<br><br>
As Elaan charged the zombies, Oghma looked around at the scene unfolding, trying to take it all in. People were running and screaming everywhere. There appeared to be zombies coming from the west side of town, while several houses were ablaze on the south side and dark figures could be seen silhouetted by the flames. From behind him he heard a primal growl. Banner he thought, but in turning around he saw it was a large Grizzly bear. Grizzly bear? It was too much to take it all in...
<br><br>
"Are you going to stand there or what friend?" Zasstryn materialized. 
<br><br>
"Zasstryn!?. What the HELL is going on?" Oghma screamed.  Even so, Zasstryn barely heard him above the noise of the villagers.
<br><br>
"Just a little illusion from our friend Beldro. Now where is Elaan, I suggest you all get out of here before it wears off" Zasstryn said quietly.
<br><br>
"Illusion?" Mundas interjected "Wow.. I must compliment him.. Those Dark Elves look mighty real to me."
<br><br>
"Dark Elves?" Zasstryn's eyes went wide with shock.
<br><br>
