Of course people were flooding into the channel.  The news obviously had
spread throughout ICQ land of Brad's presence on the channel.  Everyone was
asking his/her most important question, simply flooding my screen with an
excited scroll of queries. The once quiet channel had become as busy as a
beehive.
<br><br>
<em>someone</em>  "When will the beta start?"
<br><br>
<em>someone</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will I be able to change servers?"
<br><br>
<em>2coo4U</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think EQ is going to [beep].

<td valign="top" width="32%" style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-align: justify">


<em>IhateU</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No its your mommy that [beeps].
<br><br>
<em>2coo4U</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[beep] [beep]
<br><br>
2coo4U has been kicked off #everquest by UnotsoCoo
<br><br>
<em>someone</em> "Tell us about the magic system."
<br><br>

said his hello, and then commented something about a new movie.

Then just
as quick as his appearance in the channel, he said his goodbye and ran out
the door.  Angry fans followed him.
<br><br>
The channel then went back to its normal pace of one liners, and insults.
I went to bed.
<br><br>
Please!  Would the GODS of Norrath save us from this pestilence called boredom?  It's the start of the summer, and we have no road.  No purpose to go on.
