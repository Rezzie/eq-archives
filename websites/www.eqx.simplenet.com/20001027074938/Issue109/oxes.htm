<em>Dearest Oxesiess,
<br><br>
Hail. I am what you overworlders would call a 'Dark Elf'. Or 'Inkies'. Or 'Those mean evil pointy-eared freaks with the skeletons and stuff.'
<br><br>
And I'm a relatively NORMAL Dark Elf, too. As an apprentice Necromancer, I spend my time learning spells, killing things, and generally causing a ruckus.
<br><br>
But...but deep down inside, I know that's not really me. No one knows this, but I have a deep-seated passion for - well...
<br><br>
The opera.
<br><br>
Should I continue my way on the path of the Necromancer - one I show great promise in - or should I drop my staff and spells and take up singing, so I may become the great maestro I've always dreamed of? 
<br><br>
Sincerely, Vanorin

Dear Vanorin,
<br><br>
Ohhhhhh!!  I's know how ya's feel!  Many many times da FlooterTooter would sit back while we jist run'n along and..  Welpers lemme try ta show ya's, I'd be a runnin and a sing'n:
<br><br>
Der once was a Ice gaint<br>
Dat was ta git married<br>
And were de-fie-ant
<br><br>
He one day done varied<br>
And like'd a woody-elf<br>
And he done, wiff her, tarried
<br><br>
Den off da Shelf<br>
Da She-gaint done tooked<br>
Da big Club and bashy da snot outta him
<br><br>
Da end
<br><br>
Da FlooterTooter would say "Oxes ya's gots ta do dis stuff?  DO YA'S?!"  But da Ranger would chuckle, close his eyes and listen ta me make'n da trip go faster.  So I thinky, dunt let those Tooty's git ta ya's iffen dat's what yer worried bout.  There's lots out there dat will wanna hear ya's, jist like da Ranger does da Oxes.

<em>Dear Oxessies,
<br><br>
I've traveled across Norrath, from Ak'Anon to Kerra Isle, and from the swamps south of the deserts to your own home of Halas, but there's a problem.  As a traveler yourself, I'm sure you've had this problem at some time in your life.  The problem is bedding.  When the sun sets in Everfrost, I need a stack of thick blankets to stay warm, but it doesn't get very cold at night in the swamps.  What kind of bedding do you carry, to balance weight, warmth, and warm-weather comfort?

Dear Vamensh,
<br><br>
Blankets?  Blankets? I dunt need no stinky blankets!  I's *rough* it!  I's carry wiff me a dwarf-sized piece o leather.  ayeps dat's it.  Snow, sand, swamp, welll partic swamp...  I's carry dat.  It's perfect!  I thinky everyone should git one.  Ya's see here's da sneaky part, no matter where ya's are when it starts ta rain, ya's jist drap it across yer horns and WHAMO!
<br><br>
Ya's dunt git wet anymore!  Really I's think it's gonna be come da latest rage.  Ya's should try it.  Sure ya's git sand in yer armor sometimes, but ya's dunt git soggy.

<em>Dear Oxessies,
<br><br>
Recently an elven lady caught my eye. She generally acts sweet and
nice around me and I am trying to be as nice to her as I can. I would like to find out whether she feels more for me or not, but I am shy and don't want to make a fool out of myself. Also, she has this male companion who is much bigger than I am.
<br><br>
What can I do?

<em>Dear Oxessies,
<br><br>
As a fashion designer and tailor I am always paying attention to the comfort my clothing would afford, but in my life I have seen some pretty outrageous outfits.  Lets talk about chainmail personal wear for example. As a woman growing up when McPhearson's Chainmail Swimwear was very popular I am sure you had to deal with this. Doesn't that chafe and pinch? Would you actually dare go swimming in it?
<br><br>
Yours,

Hi ya's Furlespit,
<br><br>
Welpers I's a tailor meself.  Here's what I's done founded out is da best thingy ta do.  I's member da first day on a quest fer me peoples, I had ta jump in da river up in Everfrost.  Ya's ever done dat?  It's frozen over except a few place, and yer stand'n der in yer chainmail going "Yer nuts lady, ya's can't swim ME KILT!".  But she really is friggen scarit so ya's gotta.  Is bad enough movin round wiff legs really stiff cause o what ya's talk bout, but in da water ya's gots ta kick OUT and stuff.  SO!  Right as I's thinky bout dis stuff and how nuts she is again, a snow kitty runs by and I had a thunker!
<br><br>
I's LINED me chain!  Ayeps...  L-I-N-E-D it wiff snow kitty hide.  I think ya's should take it and run wiff it.  Lots o da sick-elf chicky types really liked da err white tuffs dat hung out at da edges.  Why I dunno, they weren't gonna jump in da ice river.
