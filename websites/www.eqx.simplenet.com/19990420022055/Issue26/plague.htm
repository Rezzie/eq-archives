Ah IRC, the land of love.  Where everyone is your friend, and you are friend
to all.  
<br><br>
Last night my wife would not get off my computer, and it would appear this is
going to last more than just one night.  She has become infected with the
Might & Magic VI bug.   I had to resort to firing up the laptop in the living
room and making a night of watching IRC <em>[joy].  3D games are no fun without
Voodoo II.</em>

I popped into #everquest.  There were about fifty people in the channel, but
only a few of them active.  As I watched the scroll, there appeared to be a
heated debate about the PVP switch system.  I obviously would rather give you
the play by play replay of the event, but because of the wonderful display of
American English, I'll just summarize for you.

It seems there is a split in the masses, half in favor of the system and half
that was not.  The debate went back and forth with pros and cons of each.
The forces "for" PVP switch obviously ran out of arguments for his position,
and resorted to name-calling.  His opponent, not enjoying the insults, then
called upon the gods of the channel and was granted "ops".  With one lethal
strike of the boot, the PVP voice was removed from the channel.
