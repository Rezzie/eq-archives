	Smoke swirled around my head, and the acrid stench of sulfur filled my nostrils. I looked around to see that I was in a rough-hewn maze of caverns sprawling under the earth. The heat was stifling, and sweat poured down my brow. I heard shouts and footsteps echoing in every direction, and Darnack emerged from the passage ahead. He spoke, but his words were garbled and unintelligible. As he stood there, I noticed that the lustrous bronze of his armor seemed somehow tainted. I glanced at his hands to see that they were discolored. As I watched, the shining bronze seemed to tarnish, fading at first to a silvery white, then darkening into a deep lustrous blue. This coloration spread like wildfire until his hands were engulfed entirely. I had just enough time to glance down and see that his boots were the same deep blue as his hands before the barbarian motioned wildly for me to follow him. 
<br><br>
	We darted through several sharp twists and turns in the cavern, each passage leading us further down into the belly of the caverns. The heat seemed to intensify with every step, and it became harder and harder to breathe as the sulfuric air thickened noticeably around us. My lungs burned as we descended deeper into the maze, the exertion from the run combined with the thickness of the air made it excruciating to breathe.
<br><br>
 I heard indistinct voices echoing from every direction. A rumbling sound seemed to emanate from the very walls of this place, and I wondered if we might be in a volcano. As we approached what appeared to be the end of the corridor, the air was rent asunder by a deafening roar. Fear crept into my soul as the heat rapidly intensified for a moment. Flashes of fire danced down the corridor in the distance, and I heard the hissing of lava within the walls. There were screams, and as we approached the corridor's end, someone came stumbling toward us. He was clad in shining robes, and had the look of a student of the mystical arts. He looked quite drained, and had several deep gashes across his chest. He opened his mouth to speak, but as he did the same earsplitting roar shook the walls of the cavern. His eyes locked with mine and he held me in his gaze.
<br><br>
	"Lord Nagafen …"
<br><br>
	There was a blinding flash of light, and this pale soul was engulfed in flames. His robes caught fire as quickly as dried parchment, and he screamed and writhed in the agony of immolation.  This flaming mass lurched in our direction, and we backpedaled quickly to avoid his flaming grasp. His screams echoed through the maze.
<br><br>
	"Hope is lost! Nagafen has been disturbed! All will perish!"
<br><br>
	Again, the flaming man lunged in my direction. This time I was not deft enough to dodge his embrace, and he wrapped his fiery arms around me. The searing pain of the flames wracked my body. I felt my skin sizzle as the fire crept through my clothing and gnawed at my skin. I struggled hard to break his grasp, but my efforts were fruitless. As I looked around wildly for any hope of escape, I realized that the cavern had faded. The pain seemed to have reached a peak, and although I still felt the blaze, my body seemed to have adjusted. I looked into the eyes of my captor, and his face melted before my eyes. It fell away further and further until nothing remained but the flames. The flames themselves formed a face, and I knew at that moment that I was in the grasp of the burning prince.
<br><br>
	The voice of Solusek echoed through my head. In the grasp of the strengthening flame he spoke to me.
<br><br>
	"The power you seek is far from peace. Battles to be won or lost are still to come. Prepare your self mentally, child of Quellios, for the flames await."
<br><br>
<hr color="black">

	I opened my eyes to the glare of the morning sun, which pierced through the gap between the curtains of my room in the Lion's Mane inn in Queynos. My skin felt itchy, and I had the eerie sense of being watched as I stood to prepare for our travels that morning. My mind was etched with the flaming face of the burning prince.
<br><br>
	I had been accustomed to such vivid dreams since my youth, but seldom was the imagery so strong as to effect me physically when I awoke. The tingling in my skin subsided as I walked around the room gathering my equipment. I pondered my dreams as I checked the contents of my belt pouch and examined the pack if ice necklaces that I was to return to the Crimson Hand.
<br><br>
After preparing my gear, I went downstairs to find Darnack and Gulinast were already packed. They were at a table in the dining area staring stoically into their morning drinks. Hot tea for Gulinast, and ale for Darnack. They were both so wrapped in their own thoughts that it seemed they didn't even notice my arrival on the scene. I ordered some fruit and purchased some travelling rations from the barmaid. As I carried my meager breakfast over to the table, Gulinast finally noticed that I had come downstairs.
<br><br>
	"The dead have risen!" he shouted with a grin. "All the Paladins of the Order shall now descend upon our heads!" 
<br><br>
	"Like you've never slept in before," I snapped. "Besides, why didn't you just wake me?"
<br><br>
	"The noise coming from your room sounded like you were already up and building yourself another bed from solid oak. I should have recognized it as your snore."
<br><br>
	I took a seat next to my brother and glanced at Darnack. His eyes were distant, and his countenance seemed stern.
<br><br>
	"Is there a problem, Darnack?" I queried from across the table. "You seem wrapped in thought."
<br><br>
	The barbarian looked to me with a mild smirk. "I'm merely worried about my family. My sister is young yet, and I wonder whether she will be alright."
<br><br>
	It seemed that he had brought that out of nowhere, but I shrugged if off. 
<br><br>
	"What's the plan, Dark One?" Darnack asked, finally back in the real world with us.
<br><br>
	"Well, I have to get these beads to the guild back on Odus. The ship to Odus will be arriving shortly, we will board and go back to Erudin. After that, I will have to see what presents itself."
<br><br>
	"Isn't there something more entertaining for Darnack and me to do, other than going back home and watching you run errands?" asked Gulinast. "I heard this morning in the market that there is a bounty on those gnolls' fangs. It would be a service to the countryside, and more importantly, profitable for us to head that way and bash some canine skulls."
<br><br>
	"Aye," said Darnack. "Halas has a similar bounty, and I have some experience in that foul place. It would be best if we used our time for something useful. It doesn't take three to run one errand."
<br><br>
	"Alright then," I agreed, "I have been wanting to use this gate spell I have for a while now, this will give me an opportunity. I will meet you in Qeynos Hills in a couple of days after I get these beads turned in. I have some questions for my guildmaster at any rate, and I have a few spells I have been meaning to learn. Be careful."
<br><br>
	We said our farewells, then Darnack and Gulinast headed to the hills to fight the beasts that nearly cost me my life. I worried, but knew Darnack's abilities from the little time we were there. I also understood that this was the life I had chosen. A wandering seeker, out for the recognition and knowledge. I would be joining them soon enough, but first I had business with the Crimson Hand.
<br><br>

	I walked out to the back of the inn where I would be less likely to be disturbed, closed my eyes, and began my casting. Visions of my home crept into my head like the mists of Toxxulia Forest. My thoughts went to the sights and sounds of that place, and I used my magical energy to make them manifest around me. 
<br><br>
	There was a sudden feeling of dispersal, followed by a dull thumping sound. My head reeled, and my stomach felt as though it had decided to visit my feet. 
<br><br>
	When I opened my eyes again, I was standing in the forest, not even 100 yards from the entrance of the city. I felt my robes and checked my pack to make sure that nothing was left behind, and when I was satisfied that the spell had been successful, I headed for the gates.
<br><br>
	I wandered past the library towards the palace. I knew every corner of this place, from the Bluehawks in the tavern down to the sentinels guarding the dungeon below the palace. In my still waning youth I had explored every area of this city, and now I planned on doing the same with the world of Norrath. There was so much more beyond the crossing that I hadn't seen, and the tiny island seemed suddenly cramped and confining as well as familiar.
<br><br>
	Upon reaching the palace, I went directly to the Crimson Hand. Josper Kenshed was with the spell crafters as usual, and I was glad to track him down so easily. I handed him the bag filled with the beads, and he examined the contents.
<br><br>
	"Well done," he grinned. "For this, I have something special for you."
<br><br>
	He reached into a large backpack, which he had resting near his feet, and pulled out a short wooden staff.
<br><br>
	"Since I am quite sure that you no longer desire the presence of your peers here on the isle, you will need this in your travels. Learn to use it now, but bear in mind it will seldom be used as your arcane power grows."
<br><br>
	"I thank you, but before I leave I do have one question. Who is Nagafen?"
<br><br>
	My elder raised an eyebrow and stared at me. 
<br><br>
	"Who passed that name on to you?" he queried. "Some foolhardy warrior with dreams of riches clouding his thoughts most likely. Lord Nagafen is none of your concern, child. Leave him be, and live to learn. All that you need to know will be revealed as you become ready."
<br><br>
	I was a bit put off by his reluctance to answer a simple question, but I was also aware that the Crimson Hand never did anything without good reason. I would have to research this on my own, as any student must. I thanked my elder and departed from the palace.
<br><br>


	That night I spent many hours in the library researching all I could. I discovered several new spells, and found a tome that was bound in red leather. The title had been translated into common, but the contents were written in a language I had never seen. I used magical means to identify the language as an elder form of elvish. 
<br><br>
	Where better to learn elder elvish than from the elves.
<br><br>
	I would depart for the Faydark in the morning, and I would learn what I needed from the wizards of the fay.
