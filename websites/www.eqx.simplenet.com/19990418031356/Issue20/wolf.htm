"We heard it howl, but it seemed distant.  It was only a moment later that it leapt
from the darkness and landed on Renigald.  It tore out his throat before we could

She was crying and gasping for breath at the same time.  I held her tightly.  Her
blood was welling from four deep parallel cuts in her left arm and a tremendous bite
in her left leg.  I could not find any way to save her.  She was already near death
when I heard her cry out and found her in this forsaken alley.  It seemed that she

I started a chant, one that I hoped would drive the creature away, but it ran into me, knocking

I know now that we did not have to seek it, for it was hunting us.  It took Wren
next.  She was hidden in the shadows, as was her way.  We were used to not seeing
her in tense situations.  But she would let us know that she was there every few
minutes.  After we did not hear from her, we started to call out.  She didn’t
