<em>Every once and I while I hear about or see an act of role-playing that is so memorable that it sparks a story.  Most role-players engage in acts freighted with Destiny and Fell Swordsmen and the like, but it is the little acts which can be so profound that they can alter a character's concept and make the player a more thoughtful person.</em>

<big><u>Excision</big></u>

Sometimes goodness has a way of sharply confronting someone of otherwise evil intent, and the impact between goodness and evil can result in a lancing of the repository of hate and shame in which evil festers. 
<br><br>
I had just returned to Qeynos from a quick trip to Erudin and was wandering the town, listening to the gossip about the gnolls, the Highpass Hold, and Antonius Bayle.  I tend to get most of my information over a mug of ale, so I had been in Qeynos and it's taverns for about a week when I noticed a young half-elven girl that kept popping up in places that I went.  I don't think she had any interest in me, but was one of those individuals who make money by showing people around the town.  Her basic expression, a sullen, greedy look, was suddenly wreathed in smiles and good cheer when she had a customer, someone she could show around the town, who would pay her some coins for her expertise.  The transformation was remarkable, and I got the feeling that either she was a surpassingly good actress, or that the sullen expression was perhaps not indicative of her true feelings.  
<br><br>
I then saw her in Fish's Ale one day, where I go to get some information from the people off the boats, sitting in some new clothes at a secluded table, toying with some object and unable to stop tears from engraving tracks in the dirt on her grubby face.  Her typical expression, that sullen and watchful look, was nowhere to be found.  Interestingly, as I watched I saw that she had purchased a mug of ale, but was filling it from bottles she had in her pack.  I found it intriguing that even in her obvious distress, there was still a calculating part of her that saw advantage and took it.
<br><br>
I walked over to her table and whispered, "I'll buy you a few ales if you can tell me the story of that storehouse of bottles in your pack."
<br><br>
Startled, she looked down at me, her expression shuttered once again.  I looked back, unthreateningly and with honest curiosity. "Don't worry, I won't tell," I said, "Fish's Ale is better drunk from the tap anyway."  I smiled, as if sharing a joke, and her shuttered look became indecisive, then resigned.
<br><br>
"Alright", she said, scooping the object she had been toying with off the table before I could see it.
<br><br>
"I've seen you showing people around town, you must know Qeynos well." This attempt at small-talk produced a surprising reaction.  Instead of the tough, sort of belligerent look I expected, tears welled up in her eyes and began to make fresh tracks down her dirty face.  Her poise warred with her emotions as she tried valiantly to avoid bursting into tears.  I made comforting noises, and handed her a handkerchief, which I instantly wrote off as a loss, because it went from travel-stained white to dirty brown as soon as it touched her face.
<br><br>
While she composed herself, I took a sharper look at her.  She must have been in her late teens, which for a half elf is really a child of about ten.  She had a small frame, but was wiry and looked, oddly, almost graceful.  She was an interesting mix of her human and elven parentage, the dirt and urchin-like demeanor contrasting with the beauty and grace that the shabby clothes could not conceal.
<br><br>
"What's your name?"
<br><br>
She sniffled a bit, and said, "Vixyn".
<br><br>
"Well, Vixyn, my name's Oghma, and let me get a round here and then you can tell me all about that sack of beer and the symbol you hid."
<br><br>
Her surprised look faded after the ales came, and she began her story.
<br><br>
"I show folks around, yeah, and it's easy work, because if you look at em and guess what they do, you show em extra stuff and they get so impressed they give you more money.  A lot of times you can clip em for a bit extra, then warn them about thieves and all, and they think they've been lifted along the way.  After a while, though, you get tired of showing all the young ones around, that don't have much, you know, and that you sort of want a rich one.
<br><br>
"I was sitting outside the gates yesterday when this guy in plate armor comes up, and says, 'I'm looking for some brewing supplies, if you take me to a place that sells them, I'll give you one platinum piece.' One platinum!  I don't charge but a few silvers for a tour of North Qeynos!  I said 'Sure!', and then took him into South Qeynos.  I didn't know what brewing supplies even were, but I asked him what type of supplies he wanted and figured that they sell it at the bakery.  Since he had a flute, I figured he was a bard, and I showed him around to the bards' guild on the way, which made him happy.  His name was Marchandt, and he was funny and nice as I showed him around.   He was a half elf like me, but raised in Faydwer, with the wood elves!
<br><br>
"So I get him to Voleen's and the girl there's got what he needs, and he gives me the platinum.  I thought that would be the end of it."
<br><br>
I nodded, encouraging her. "So what happened then?"
<br><br>
"Then I go next door to Fish's, because sometimes there is a bard near there who takes a sip or two and has errands to run, and I saw this guy, I forget his name, but he knew about this!"
<br><br>
With that she reached under the table and took out the symbol.
<br><br>
It was crudely made, as such things usually are, but it made me recoil.  Clenched in her small fist was a symbol of Bertoxxulous, Lord of Disease!  A more foul god could not be found in Norrrath, his vile hatred of good and his love of suffering spewing forth crazed minions, like an festering sore on the face of the world.
<br><br>
"Why do you have that?" I asked, searching her face for an answer to why such a young one would have such a thing.
<br><br>
"Because my master worshipped him, and because Bertoxxulous hurts people, and makes them suffer!  They should all suffer!  I hope they all die!"  Her hands gripped the symbol until her knuckles were white. "All of them, from when I was little, that made fun of me and hurt me and the schoolmasters who made 'special lessons' for me so they could see what a freak I was!  The humans who left me in the aqueducts to die when I was no longer any fun! Fun! Like getting beaten and passed around…"
<br><br>
She started sobbing, and curled into a little ball.  I hopped off the chair and went around to her and held her gently in my arms, her frail form shuddering with wracking sobs.  I made soothing noises and rocked her gently.  As she quieted down, I gave her another handkerchief, another loss, so she could wipe her eyes and blow her nose.
<br><br>
"What about this man, the one who knew about the symbol?"
<br><br>
"He came into the bar and saw me, and he had seen me coming out from the aqueducts where the temple is, and he started hitting me, and throwing me around the room, saying how my beliefs were anna - annathema-something like that.  And he was BIG, one of those barbarians from Halas."
<br><br>
"What happened then?"
<br><br>
"Then Marchandt came in and starting beating up the barbarian, and really working him over!  He hit him and hit him until he fell, and while he was doing it he sang a song which about made the barbarians ears bleed.  Some of the guards came in and there was Marchandt, looking untouched, and he told them that the barbarian attacked me unprovoked, and should be jailed.  Then he took my hand and we went out to the end of the docks, and he sang a song which was really peaceful and nice, and I didn't hurt so much any more."
<br><br>
"Why do you think he did that?"
<br><br>
"I don't know! He already paid me, he didn't owe me anything!  He just… <em>helped</em>.  Because he felt like it.  He didn't even want anything from me after, like they usually do! He stuck up for me with the guards!"
<br><br>
I sighed.  Her bafflement was genuine, as if in her world, nothing was free, and no-one acted out of an impulse of generosity.  When I first met her, I thought she was very young, but maybe she was already older than I in some ways.  Her eyes had the hard look that comes from looking at a world with fear, and knowing that showing that fear is an invitation to abuse.
<br><br>
"Then he said, 'Want to see something fun?', and he took out his flute and said 'Jump in after me!'.  Then he started playing this song and he jumped in the water, and I did too, and I could <em>breathe</em> the water.  It was like the music was magic!  We swam around under there, and he told jokes and stories and I even made up a story.  I didn't know I could do that!
<br><br>
"We stayed under the water for about an hour, swimming and, you know, just doing nothing.  Floating in the water without having to worry about coming up for air.
<br><br>
"He got tired after a while, though, and we sat out on the docks for a while and dried out.  We talked about where he has been and he's been all over!  He asked me what I was doing and if I wanted to see things besides Qeynos and then he took me shopping!  He did!  And he bought me traveling stuff and a sword, and showed me stuff about how to use it, since all I've used is a dagger since you can hide it better."
<br><br>
As she chattered on about her day with Marchandt, I thought how this event must have radically affected her world view.  Normally someone so street-toughened would not expose themselves so openly to a stranger. I know that she probably would feel differently if her world had not been so shaken up.  It is a dangerous place to be for someone used to being on the streets.  I would need to be careful to tell her I was leaving, and therefore not a threat to her later.  I would hate to have her new sword used on me!
<br><br>
I interrupted her. "Now what are you going to do, Vixyn?  Will you still show tours around Qeynos?  Will you still run errands for the shops and the guilds?"
<br><br>
Vixyn looked at me blankly.  "I… I don't know.  I suppose.  I mean, I guess I will."
<br><br>
"And your customers, will you still clip them?  Will you lead them into a dark alley so your friends can mug them?"
<br><br>
Her look of surprise, then shame, gave her away.  She looked at me frankly, and said, in a voice with steel behind it, "The world still owes me a lot Oghma, and I intend to get my share and then some.  I'm not going to get all mushy and give away what I've earned because you say so."
<br><br>
I chuckled.  "I don't expect you to, Vixyn.  What I expect is that you will go on doing the best you can, because it's what you've learned and what is around you.   Someday Marchandt's deeds will come to mind when someone else needs it as much as you did.  I hope then that you find the parts of you that you have forgotten.  I have to leave now, I can hear the boat to Erudin docking, and I need to get back on it."
<br><br>
I got up and walked over to the bar to pay our tab.  By the time I had returned, she was gone, her slim form disappearing in the darkness.
<br><br>
I hoped that she would find a way to reconcile what had happened to her and make it part of how she sees life.  Maybe greed and lust for treasure and power isn't why we are on Norrath.  Maybe there is a part of all of us that yearns for something better for not only ourselves, but for others.
