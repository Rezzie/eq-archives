	<big><big>E</big></big>rudites are, of course, the most evolved members of the human race.  They have advanced beyond the petty bickering and lusty couplings of normal humans, of course, and they are far higher than the grunts and chest beating of the barbarians of the North.  High Elves are, of course the highest of the elves, by general consensus, advanced in civilization past the loose tribal organization of the Wood Elves, and of higher moral character than the heartless and evil Dark Elves.  Right?  Right?!?  Right…
<br><br>
	To follow a discussion of inter-species conflict, we must then address inter-racial conflict. I’m working from the little that EQ has given us as far as racial description, so bear with me, I’m extrapolating with little data J.   I am assuming that the differences between the above groups are more social than evolutionary, a matter of nurture as opposed to nature. I’ll leave to some Erudite to take a barbarian baby and raise it among the Erud to determine whether this theory holds water.  I can picture the controversy in the scholarly circles in the towers of Erudin when the child displays higher reasoning…
<br><br>
	What predisposes members of the same race to distrust/dislike others?  A past history of conflict, a feeling of racial pride, an aesthetic dislike of the appearance/behavior of the other race could all lead to the basic creation of the mental construct of "other".  Once this is created, racial distrust begins.

<td valign="top" width="34%" style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-align: justify">
	Erudites probably see themselves as the "final variant" of the human race, and since most scholarship appears from them, it is difficult to dispute this finding.  Having take a step back from their racial forebears and having become observers, the Erud find the other human variants backwards, filthy, and less mentally advanced than themselves.
<br><br>
Humans can see themselves as the best-rounded races.  Able to hold their own in the lofty discussions in Erudin, able to chase down bears with the barbarians, and able to practice all professions, Humans are quite clearly outclassed by no other race.  What’s the big deal?
<br><br>
	*Snort* Humans, Erudites! *Growl* Bunch of weaklings!  A tame seal could take out one of those hairless wimps with one slap of it’s tail.  Two hours in the winds of the North would strip them to their bones!  Only the strong can survive Norrath.
<br><br>
With Humans, we are really looking at is centuries of social and perhaps evolutionary trends, where one group’s enforced (by the environment) distance from the other breeds contempt.  There are no feelings of abandonment by barbarians for the Erudites leaving to form their own nation, nor do the humans really seem to care.  Perhaps inter-racial feelings among humans aren’t strong enough in general to take it to the level of racial hatred.  This changes when we get to Elves.

<td valign="top" width="33%" style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-align: justify">
	Between Dark elves and the other elves there are high feelings.  The difference between the elven racial groups is not one of distance or a mere "growing apart", but a deep sense of racial betrayal.  High Elves, with their attachment to nature and the Gaia-like theory of world unity, see the Dark Elves as insane power-seekers who have made a dark pact with evil to gain power.  Dark Elves see High Elves as fools whose "tree-hugging" as led them to allow other races to gain ascendance over the Elven (read Master) race.  Such adherence to weak philosophy makes the High Elves misguided idiots responsible for the necessity to seek power in other, more creative ways.  Wood elves appear to be avoiding the conflict due to their desire to stay close to nature.  Power-struggles and eldritch magics are not important compared to watching the graceful curve of a branch or hunting with a wolf companion.
<br><br>
Within in the two racial groups, then, there are very different feelings.  It appears that the higher the stakes (the elf groups battle for Good vs. Evil, and the humans don’t really battle for anything) the stronger the feelings.  Also, the elves have many centuries of conflict whereas the humans are a relatively young race.  Elves, too have longer lives to consider the fate of the world.

So, all this being said, how would each race feel about the other races? 	With the information and suppositions from both articles, plus some guesses as the to general nature of each race, I have created the following guess at how the individual races could feel for each other:
<br><br>
Key:  H = Human, ER = Erudite, B = Barbarian, HE = High Elf, WE = Wood Elf, DE = Dark Elf, ½ E = Half Elf, D = Dwarf, T = Troll, O = Ogre, ½ = Halfling, and G = Gnome
<br><br>
· This chart should be read top to bottom, as if the race on the top line was thinking about the race on the left of the chart.  Some races to share the same feelings for the opposite race, i.e. Humans accept Erudites, but Erudites are indifferent to humans.
