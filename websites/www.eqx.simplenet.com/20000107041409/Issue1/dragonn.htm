<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; After much debate, the Bill spoke out.&nbsp; They are not currently planning to have dragons as PCs, and at most have a lukewarm feeling for the idea.&nbsp; They do, however, plan to make some draconic monsters. <BR>
<BR>
Here is a reprint of some storyline on the <A href="http://www.everquest.com/fr_almanac.htm">EverQuest homepage</A>:&nbsp;

THE FIRST AGE: DARKNESS AND DRAGONS<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is rumored amongst most of the intelligent races of Norrath that first came the Dragons. Whether this is fact or Dragonkind propaganda is not important, for which is more vital, the truth or what the truth is believed to be? It is said that thousands of years ago the world known as Norrath was &quot;noticed&quot; by Veeshan, the great Crystalline Dragon who rules the Plane of Sky. Pleased with the conditions on Norrath, Veeshan deposited her brood onto the frozen continent of Velious.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, with one swipe of her mighty claws, Veeshan opened several great </SPAN><BR>

<P>
I will make an attempt to analyze:<BR>
<BR>
Apparently, dragons were first to come to the world, as these histories that declare themselves as rumours are almost always true, else people would not bother to repeat it (most cases).&nbsp; The mention of&nbsp; &quot;Dragonkind propaganda&quot; seems to indicate that &quot;pure&quot; dragons are an intelligent, sentient race.&nbsp; The fact that dragons were the first to come here also seems to indicate that dragons will be very powerful, and very rare.&nbsp; From posts however, I have gotten the impression that there will be many lesser dracoforms to mercilessily slaughter.&nbsp; Dragons, however, seem more the type to either neogotiate with or have incredibily boring and drawn out battles with if you're foolhardy enough.&nbsp; Hopefully, they will be a high AI race that you can ally with.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that Veeshan marked Velious with her claw seems to indicate that (a) dragon(s) will be present there, most likely a good deal more powerful than elsewhere.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Some items open to speculation:&nbsp; will dragons have claimed territorities, or <BR>

will &nbsp;&nbsp; they&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wander?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will&nbsp;&nbsp; they&nbsp; be intelligent with a level of interactivity other than see it-kill it (Bill seemed to indicate that they would)? What about dracoforms (serpents, hydras, etc.)?&nbsp; Do dragons continue to influence the worldplot of Norrath today?&nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR>
Are there any dragons that maintain a power structure and plot, or are they confined within the range of solitary to small groups?</P> 
<P>
Being as biased in favor of dragons as I am, I can simply hope that the EQ team will make the dragon an intriguing creature, at least as much as humans and humanoids and hopefully more.<BR>
