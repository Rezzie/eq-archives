This e-mail is in response to the article <em><a href="../Issue78/switch.htm">Switch off, brain off</a></em> in EQX issue 78. Specifically this short-sighted quote from that article:
"<em>[Verant is] a corporation, and as such will always lean toward the way that gives them the widest audience and the most cash. It's not in their interest to eliminate players, and thus is born the RP switch</em>."
There is a key bit of information that Archanalia doesn't seem to be aware of: This switch was petitioned by a large group of well meaning, arguably misguided, Role-Players. Someone even took the time to dedicate a web site to the cause, inventing mock encounters and doctoring screen shots to illustrate. (Note, I remember reading the site, but was unable to find it. I'm assuming it was taken down.) 
Contrary to Archanalia's opinion, implementing the switch wasn't simply an example of corporate greed, it wasn't even an attempt to attract peripheral markets. No so called Power Gamers, d00ds, or even Casual Gamers ever cared about this switch. We <em>Role-Players</em>, presumably there target market, wanted it. Our collective voice petitioned for it. It was the role-players that Verant tried to appease. It was the role-players that Verant compromised for. They wanted the role-players, they wanted <em>us</em>, to have every opportunity to enjoy this game.
In a nutshell, we were the players Verant didn't want to eliminate.

<em>I don't doubt that the idea was born from players. Many suggestions for improving the game are. But then why do you think the RP switch was born? Again, because Verant do not have the time and resources to go out and make sure that people fit the definition of roleplaying (A defintion which is actually very simple), they opted to take the easy way out. The RP switch was implemented and it stands now as an excuse to keep from having to spend more effort on making this a "roleplaying" game, it helps to show people that they "are doing something", even if that something is misguided, and it keeps them from having to eliminate players (and subsequently cash subscriptions). 
<br><br>
I thank you for the background information, but I still believe that everything I said in my article is still valid. The fact that the switch was not thought up by Verant doesn't make it any less a cop-out. Now that's harsher language than I wanted to use in my article, because it makes it sound like I don't appreciate this tremendous game. I hope the Verant employees understand that it has been a pleasure to play their game, I just struggle (like those folks who thought up the RP switch) with the non-roleplaying influences that permeate the environment.

I would just like to say that <a href="../Issue79/caveats.htm">Celestine's article</a> about balancing and/or 
strengthing the classes was one of the best articles I have ever read on EQ 
Express. Not to say that your other articles are not good because they are, 
but Her article was one of the most thought out ones I have read. She went 
at the issue from every angle and took a completly bias view of it. I would 
just like to Congratulate her on a job well done.

I just wanted to compliment the writers of the <a href="../credits/aklar.htm">Rogue Tale</a> and <a href="../credits/tceira.htm">T'Ciera and Darvinn's Love</a>.  Both stories have kept me craving more, and it's become a rush to read the issue on Saturday.  I would have to say that The Rogue's Tale is my favorite of the two, but both have been well-written.  The most recent episode of T'Ciera's and Darvinn's Love seems to have a different writing style however, and I found myself wondering mid-story whether there was a different author or if that was merely the author's way of showing T'Ciera's insanity?  Either way, it is still an excellent story and I look forward to many, many more wonderful works in your upcoming issues.

PS As to the designer with the blacksmith/psychologist father from Oklahoma University, I'd definitely believe that possible as well... in Oklahoma at least.  (From a former Tulsan, and ex-Sooner. &lt;grin&gt;)
<br><br><br>
<em>Vendui,
<br><br>
I thank you for the interest in t'Ceira and Darvinn's story.  Yes, the last part (t'Ceira's tale) was written by me as well.  I changed the writing style to try to bring home her agony and twisting...being a Teir'Dal and being inundated by all the "hate" preaching of the Cleric's of Innoruuk.  Anyway, that's what that was all about. The next parts will probably ALSO have different writing styles too.
<br><br>
Thanks for your support and may your blade be swift and your wit swifter still!
<br><br>
Thanks,
<br><br>

Sires,

Baaaarrrrkkk!!
<br><br>
Whilst an avid reader (yes I can read) of EQX, I must take considerable offence at the sponsors this issue.
<br><br>
Spay and neuter your gnolls indeed!!
<br><br>
I and my friends are deeply upset by this and will not take this lightly... Qeynos will belong to the Sabertooth Clan once again!!! How dare you suggest such a thing. The outrage was completed by you showing a Paw gnoll. Sires, we of Blackburrow are quite different from our Paw cousins...

Absor,
<br><br>
I just read the comment on my letter that I sent to you after reading EQX 78. 
<br><br>
I can respect that you don’t understand one bit of what I wrote, and maybe no one else did either, but please explain to me why you feel it's so "off-base". I read it again, and I can’t see what you mean. When I read it I just see someone who disagrees with what Ariel wrote, and an opinion on the role-play switch.
<br><br>
Know that I do not write this is anger or anything, I just want to know what it was that I wrote that made it so "off-base". 
<br><br>
I hope you can find the strength to reply to my mail with some explanation.
<br><br>
Thank you,
<br><br>

Absor:

I just felt compelled to write you and tell you how much I've been enjoying <a href="../credits/aklar.htm">Rogue: A Tale of Treachery</a>. 
<br><br>
This story is shaping up to be brilliant. It is clearly as good as (if not better than) a lot of published Barnes and Noble type fantasy books out there. 
<br><br>
A hearty Well Done to fellow talespinner Aklar, and a plea to keep them coming!

Dear Ahtenret,
<br><br>
I read your article about the day you almost quit Everquest, and while I haven't yet experienced an exchange quite that nasty, I've seen quite a bit of rude behavior.  I've thought about the problem, and have a proposal for a possible fix I'd like to bounce off of you before I send it off to Verant.
<br><br>
-------<br>
Summary:<br>
Institute a "jerk level" statistic that tracks how much other people complain about a character's behavior.  Have guides monitor the  behavior of jerks or have the server take direct action against people who are jerks.
<br><br>
Premise:<br>
Jerks are a minority of players that offend fairly large numbers people on a fairly regular basis.
<br><br>
Requirements:<br>
1) the solution must involve limited or no GM involvement<br>
2) it must not be incredibly difficult to program<br>
3) it must actively discourage "jerk" behavior, as defined by the majority of players witnessing or being affected by said behavior<br>
4) it must be resistant to abuse by said jerks
<br><br>
Proposal:<br>
Create a new statistic, the "jerk level" (hereafter abbreviated JL).  Players can declare someone to be "a jerk" once/EQ day.  Declaring someone to be a jerk increases their JL by one, and uses up your ability for the day.  Every day (at sunrise, perhaps?) your JL decreases by one, bottoming out at zero.  JL is preserved at logoff, but is slightly reduced upon death.
<br><br>
Discussion:<br>
The JL is a tool to be used to promote good manners and role-playing in EQ. If a player is behaving like a jerk, target him and identify him as a jerk.  Declarations are limited to one/EQ day to discourage abuse.  This will hopefully encourage people to save it for something truly offensive.  If a pack of d00ds fingers you, simply be elsewhere in an hour or two when they can declare again.  Similarly, your JL declines to zero by one/EQ day to allow the odd insult or the past of a reformed character to be forgotten.  When JL reaches a certain target, (50?) begin enforcement procedures.  Have all stats, skills, and/or faction ratings reduced by one for every JL over 50.  This should cause the jerk to lose the ability to do whatever it is that others found offensive (killstealer's spells fizzle, engineers can no longer outrun trains, etc).  Faction hits could eventually cause guards to "take out the trash" - making even cities hazardous for jerks. Alternatively, have guides monitor players with high JLs and take whatever action they deemed appropriate.  By having culprits identified by quite a few players at once, the guide's time can hopefully be conserved.  When you are fingered as a jerk, you should get a notification of this fact *without* the JL attached - keeping 'em guessing should keep 'em civil.
<br><br>
Tweaks:<br>
1) adjust the target JL for automatic action to make it easier or harder to be flagged<br>
2) adjust JL loss at death.  Blood should pay for sins, but how many?<br>
3) disallow use by and/or targeting of newbies (say, level 3 and under) who can't be expected to have learned the ropes yet.<br>
4) limit the max increase of JL to, say, 10/day.  Doing one incredibly stupid act (say, training DVinn, Crush, & co. into several lower level parties at the Faydark zone) shouldn't by itself make you a jerk.<br>
5) when you finger someone as a jerk, *your* JL raises by one to limit casual use.
<br><br>
-------<br>
Comments?  Suggestions?  Improvements?  I'm not sure how refined this idea should be before sending to Verant, or what exactly those proper channels would be.  Please let me know what you think...I look forward to your reply.

<em>Phillip,
<br><br>
While your ideas are interesting and have a certain degree of merit (a player policed society sounds like a good idea in may ways), your jerk rating has the unfortunate side effect of being open to abuse. Any time players can flag one another for negative purposes you open the door to those very same 'jerk' players forming associations and labeling everyone around them just out of sheer snottyness. This is one of the biggest problems in the Online world. Who does one 'police' the player base without opening the door to abuse? I certainly haven't figured it out. I don't think any of the companies have either.
<br><br>
Personally I'd love to see the noose in Freeport get used every so often. But as it stands now, I'll stick to one of the precepts of the U.S. legal system: it is better to let a hundred murderers go free than persecute one innocent. Unfortunately we have to take the same approach to online gaming. You think people complain now when they are effected by a bug? Imagine what would happen if an innocent was 'jerked'.
