	In my third installment of role-playing races articles I deviate from following Oghma's order of race coverage and have found myself writing from the Swamps near Grobb. Amidst the happy frog people and jolly Fungus men that inhabit the swamps of Innothule, dwell Trolls. Trolls are almost exclusively born to serve Cazic-Thule, God of Terror. Some EverQuest literature refers to Trolls as anarchists, while other classic references would create an image of cunning evil beasts.
<br><br>
	Creating an enjoyable role as a Troll can be easy and fun, and relatively easy to build on your role as you go. Trolls are not awfully bright, and thus their needs and wants are going to be fairly simple. The fun part is that these simple needs can be hilarious to work into your role. OK, we have a Troll. He is eight feet and a quarter ton of undisciplined ruthless indiscretion, and he is hungry. In case you didn't know, Trolls are omnivores with a taste for human meat. Dwarves are a feast, and Elves and Halflings are rare treats. He also loves his beer, as well as other simple pleasures like treasure. 
<br><br>
The Troll's psychology can be summed up fairly simply. They fear what they do not understand, which happens to be a lot. They handle fear by avoiding it or destroying it, usually the latter. Trolls are incredibly stubborn, and not fond of change. Of all the races Trolls seem as though they would be the least likely to leave their home and the most unsuited for adventure, however the lust for conquest somehow moves even these sluggish beings.
	<br><br>
When starting to think about your possible role, consider what makes the role of a Troll or Ogre so much different from many other races. Not only are they stupid, but many of the aspects of social life that form the roles of a civilized race will be absent. Also consider that Trolls have many differences from even Ogres, and if you asked a scholar they would probably tell you that Ogres and Trolls share very little in common. Ogres were created and bred for war and conquest, whereas Trolls are more of an evil afterthought lurking in the darkness of the swamps. Setting a goal to make your Troll's role different from that of the typical Ogre would be a healthy one.
<br><br>
 	Face to face, a Troll probably wouldn't talk much at all, as complex speech is a function of the more intelligent races. Trolls would communicate via grunts and gestures often, although I would suggest incorporating some sort of usable speech habits into your Troll anyway to accommodate the need for communication in the game. Many players I have gamed with incorporate a great deal of slurring of typed speech to aid in the illusion. This alone can be very amusing when well practiced. Another possible way to enrich your role could be to create rhymes for certain events or figures of speech, as Trolls are known to rhyme sometimes. In addition you could add to your role some sort of neurotic disorder such as an obsession or compulsion. 
<br><br>
Obsessions are fun when used correctly in a role, and role playing a creature as innately stupid as a Troll is a great opportunity to experiment with it. Your Troll could really hate snakes for example, to the point of bravado and foolishness. Or perhaps he is afraid of rats to the point of squealing like a schoolgirl. Other common obsessions could be aversions to enclosed spaces, heights, or enthralling rage upon the mention of a particular word or phrase. In one example my Troll is never comfortable unless he is drunk or has beer to get drunk with. He has feelings of self-doubt when he is sober and avoids risky confrontations unless he has beer on hand.
<br><br>
	Thus far I have made light of the insidiously evil role Trolls take in the food chain, and only by design. If you seek to create a much more serious Troll, playing along the mechanical limitations of the Southern evil races will probably suffice. The role of ruthless evil is laid out for you, with nothing but chaos to spread.  Little or no effort should be needed to please your evil Gods, as there is only good out there to slay. Your serious Troll would probably not be much for words, and when he did speak it would be brief. Start simple with your idea, and play with it. When you have other ideas work them into your day to day gaming. Remember that is it the casual meetings with other players that define the most of your impression, and these casual encounters should be the ones you think ahead about for your role. Now take your stinky swamp waterlogged hides out there and do something Trollish.
