Now we have a challenge for you.  This screen shot was taken from the EverQuest site.  
Let's see what kind of tales our readers can tell about it.  Just send you story to the 
<a href="mailto:alanvc@concentric.net">editor</a> before midnight on Friday, May 1st.  
He'll compile them and you can read them all next week.  We will not edit them at all, so 
please check for spelling and grammatical errors before sending them in.
<br><br>
Our staff will also be writting stories, so don't think we're expecting you to do all the work.
