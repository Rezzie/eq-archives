"You sloth!" Emerson roared, reaching across the table to strike at his companion,
bloodying his lip rather well. Goareke seemed rather smug. "You told me you didn’t
know how to play this game," Emerson whined. "That’s going to come out of your wage,
sloth."

"Gentlemen," the apothecary chimed, "time for a new game I think. How about Erud’s
Trap, you both know the rules right?" He looked to each, then to Kip to make sure he
had not lost the dealer on the child’s name for the card game. Emerson seemed rather
happy at the choice, ordering another beer, then peering across at his adventuring
companion threateningly. To a bystander one might think they had never met, seeming
rather unfit for adventuring together.

members of that adventuring group had left to set up camp for the evening. Only the
two warriors, the apothecary and Kip remained in the bar, with the groundskeeper and
bartender watching carefully.
