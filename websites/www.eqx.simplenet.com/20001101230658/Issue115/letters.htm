"On friday the 18, on the Vallon Zek server, i came across a troll named
Gargatox.  He claimed to be "The Gargatox" as in bard's log. I am not sure if he was an imposter or the true Gargatox. I decided that you would know. 
Thank you for your time!"

<em>"Garg sightings have become more and more common recently.  At first, they were isolated incidents in the Innothule Swamp made by drunken frogloks.  But within a week, people in the Freeport area have begun reporting sightings of this troll.  Does he exist?  If so, why isn't there a massive religious pilgrimage to Freeport?  Where is the rest of his entourage?  Do I talk to much?  Only time will tell....(To all who care: Yes, it was me. The real Garg :D)"</em>

Absor,
<br><br>
I am responding to a <a href="../Issue114/letters.htm">letter</a> published in #114 by D'kama, hopeful Tier'Dal warrior. Because I work in 
advertising graphics, my work and home computers have been very powerful Macintosh systems. 
When I first discovered the existence of EverQuest I hoped I would be able to play using Virtual PC 
(PC emulating software) and a PC 3D graphics card.
<br><br>
I bought the game and tried every combination of driver and graphics card and was able to log onto the 
EverQuest server selection screen but no further. Many hours were spent searching the internet and 
posting in newsgroups hoping I could find a key that would let me play EverQuest on my G3. 
Meanwhile, I poured over web sites such as EverQuest Express dreaming of the day I would be able to 
walk the hills and plains of Narreth as a human ranger. Unfortunately, all of my efforts were in vain.
<br><br>
Sure, I'd toyed with the idea of buying a PC, but how could I justify such a purchase for the sake of A 
GAME? Of course I would play other games on the PC even though EverQuest would be the 
REASON to buy one... but I'm not married to a millionaire, after all.
<br><br>
And then I just did it. I bought a PC last Wednesday evening and stepped into Surefall Glade that 
night! I've logged about 40 hours in the six days since then. It was everything I'd hoped it would be 
and more. Now my only problem is tearing myself away from the computer to get some sleep before 
work the next morning.
<br><br>
So my advice to D'kama would be DO IT. It's worth the investment. Buy an adapter to hook your new PC up to your Mac monitor and you will only need to purchase the CPU. You won't be sorry.

<a href="../Issue110/edita.htm">Robert's letter</a>
<br><br>
Thanks for passing that story on to your readers.  It would have been nice
to have read Robert's article if he had had the time to finish it.  This
reminded me of something similar from my Ultima Online days.  I didn't know
him personally but there was well regarded player who made friends for about
a year in game and then unexpectedly was killed by a drunk driver.  The UO
game masters took the suggestion of a player and created a memorial in game
where a user could click on a sign "In memory of...".  They also created a
permanent dolphin by that same person's name which I thought was a nice
tribute.
<br><br>
Finally on a similar note, I was reading through some random links looking
for UO sites.  I happened across one site where the family of a man who was
murdered tried to keep his site going for a little while longer to get the
word out he had been killed.  In both of these instances I took a long pause
to think about the fact that I would never have a chance to meet either
person.
<br><br>
It's strange how people we consider strangers can have this effect on us.  I
think in my case it's because I'm computer oriented and feel something in
common with other computer oriented people, even if they are strangers.
<br><br>
