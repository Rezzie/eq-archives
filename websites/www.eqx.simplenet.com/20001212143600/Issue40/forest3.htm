	The battle between the races raged on, with the elves having the slightly upper hand. The forest was filled with screams and groans, as ogre and elf fell. Brendelson and Leif helped the wounded elves, trying to limit the elven fatalities. Brendelson wanted to help the elves more, but he was still weak from his earlier battle with the ogre camp. Leif, though, was disposing of the occasional stray ogre.  Brendelson noticed that Leif's face was hard and emotionless, killing without thought. If outnumbered Leif was afraid and cautious. When an ogre put up a good fight, it was as if Leif was enjoying himself. This was a distinct turn around from the Leif he had talked to earlier.
<br><br>
	"Leif, what has happened to you?" Brendelson inquired, while casting a healing spell on an elf.
<br><br>
	"I-I don't know Brendelson. I just feel as if it must be done. I know I've acted as if I didn't enjoy fighting. I was denying my true feelings. I love fighting, but, I also want to be a Druid," Leif admitted, "I'm ashamed Bren. I have failed your teachings."
<br><br>
	"I'm sorry to hear that."
<br><br>
	They continued to work and kill, both men seeming to travel miles apart in just a few seconds. Neither noticed that the sky was beginning to darken. Lightening lanced across the sky, illuminating the battling warriors. It was only when Bren noticed a distinct buzzing in the back of his skull, did he look up.
<br><br>
	Traveling across the battlefield was a lone black figure. Dark blue light churned around him, creating and eerie effect. What was most evil, though, was what was traveling behind him. Ogres that had moments before been corpses were rising up, not of there natural will, but from magic. Brendelson gasped in horror as recognition swept through him. 
<br><br>
"Leif!" called Brendelson hoping that the young man would listen, "Leif, run into the forest! Hurry!" But Leif was not close enough to hear. In fact Leif was close enough to the approaching mob that he could feel the ground rumbling as they walked. Leif cast a spell of invisibility about him and hoped he would not be noticed. 
<br><br>

<br>
	"We have won!" Orag cried, not particularly to anyone, "Now I must look as my enemies are slaughtered by one of their own kind."
<br><br>
	Only Orag knew what was awaiting the elves, and who was behind the resurrection of the army. He clutched his sword and felt his stomach churn with excitement. If only he himself could fight. He could not though, he must stay alive and produce a new heir to the throne. But he could relish his victory.

<br><br>

<br>
	Brendelson walked calmly toward the horde of undead ogres, despite feeling the effects of the evil on his body. As he walked he cast a spell of protection on himself, preparing for the encounter that was only a few hundred yards away. 
<br><br>
	Brendelson drew forth his magical quarterstaff and threw his cloak to the ground. He tensed his muscles and drew the magical energies of the forest into his being. He stood confidently and called out to his enemy.
<br><br>
	"Grogamon!"
<br><br>
	"Brendelson. It is you," Grogamon answered, " I have waited a long time, for this, moment." Grogamon smiled as he drew his sword. He threw off his own cloak to reveal shiny plate armor. "Now you will perish."
<br><br>
	Grogamon lunged forward, his body sluggish from the plate armor but still very deadly. Brendelson dodged quickly and swung his quarterstaff. The blow connected and instantly the armor rusted where the blow hit. Brendelson smiled as he thanked the gods that his quarterstaff was still enchanted. 
<br><br>
	"You will die Grogamon," Brendelson promised, "You will die for what you have done to me, my family, and all of the elves in this forest." Brendelson hated Grogamon, and hated the memory of what he had been like. 	
	<br><br>
	Brendelson had grown up in an elven village, being half-elf and half-human. He had been prejudiced against since he had been born, but he had grown accustomed to it. One of his favorite playmates growing up had been a elf named Kokart. Kokart had loved the forest just as Brendelson had. They had run through the forest looking for adventure. Then one afternoon everything changed. They had been exploring when they had stumbled into a little hut. They went inside and found many items, but had no idea what they were. One article in particular, a wooden bottle, intrigued Kokart. He examined it and decided to open it. 
	<br><br>
	Kokart pulled on the lid and it popped off. In a great roar, Brendelson was thrown against the wall and knocked unconscious. When Brendelson awoke he saw Kokart's body, the life sucked from it. Brendelson, dazed and confused, wandered back to the village. Loud noises and commotion startled him. He hid and looked into the village. A long elf was standing in the middle of the village hands upraised. He looked as if he were growing in stature by the second. 
<br><br>
	Brendelson limped into his own house to find his parents had suffered the same fate as Kokart. He finally made the connection between the elf outside to his parents and Kokart's death. He rushed out of the house with his father's dagger in his hand. He ran towards the stranger, ready to exact his revenge on the elf. He swung at the stranger but was stopped by a force unknown to him. The elf looked at him and smiled.
<br><br>
	"Did you actually think you could stop Grogamon, young elf?" Grogamon said, "Only one other person has stopped me and he was over 3000 years old." 
<br><br>
He moved over to the elf and began to drain his life force. Brendelson tried to resist but it was no use. When Brendelson was about to lose consciousness, an unexpected thing happened. Out of the forest crashed the largest bear Brendelson had ever seen. The bear bashed the elven Necromancer clear across the village. Brendelson, with his final amount of strength, crawled out of the village and into the forest. He crawled until he reached the road to the nearest village, where some strangers picked him up.  He vowed to avenge his families' death by one day killing the evil that had killed them.
<br><br>
	Brendelson came out of his flashback and smiled.
<br><br>
	"Yes Grogamon, it will be you that will die," Brendelson said.
<br><br>

<br>	
	Leif was unaware when the first undead ogre approached him. The ogre swung his giant club down on the young man's unprotected leg. Leif gasped as the pain overwhelmed him. Leif took out a sword that he had been given when he had come to age. Druids hated these weapons, but they hated fighting too, so Leif decided to use it. 
<br><br>
	Leif hacked and slashed at the ogres, killing them for the second time. Blood and internal organs flew everywhere as Leif cut his way through the ogres. His thinking took a back seat to his instincts, as he parried thrust and chopped his way through the horde. Then he emerged from the melee. He looked around and saw that only one thing was standing beyond. It was Orag. Leif smiled and started running towards Orag. 
<br><br>	
	"Now it is my turn, Orag."
