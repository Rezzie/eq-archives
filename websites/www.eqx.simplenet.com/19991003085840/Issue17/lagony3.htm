And could be heard the clatter of armor against stone walls.  And they knew that the
dwarf was dead.  In fact, the Sony gods credited Archanalia with this great victory
in one-on-one combat.
<br><br>
Archanalia collected the Dwarf’s goods, but found no magic supplies among them.  How
then did he do such witchery?

Later A&A returned to town.  There they stood in the courtyard and listened to the
minstrels play while Absor contemplated his epic poem "Archanalia’s Butt and The

a young girl moving away with his magical lute.

Absor shouted, "Stop!  Thief!"  and the minstrels stopped playing and the crowd
turned to watch as Archanalia tackled the thief.

The girl turned to the crowd and shouted "Laggers!!  They use Lag!!"  Whereupon the
crowd picked up stones and began to shower the two, causing much pain.
<br><br>
"That’s enough for me for the night," said Archanalia.

"Me too," said Absor.  And both disappeared within split seconds of each other,
thus escaping death by seconds.
<br><br>
"Loggers!!  Cursed loggers!!" The crowd cried.
<br><br>
Hearing these cries, just up the road a group of lumberjacks made a sharp u-turn in
their carriage and headed for another town where their kind is welcome.
