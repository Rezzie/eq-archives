I was thinking about MCD (Multiple Character Disorder) and how playing many characters can, at times, be exceptionally frustrating.  Sometimes I sit down at my computer to play EverQuest, manage to get to the character option screen, and get stuck.  When I sat down I was planning on playing my catch-up character.  I started a character on Test, but realized that I wanted to play him on my regular server instead.  So I am playing catch up with myself as I try to get the new one up to the level of the old one (which also leaves me in an interesting position to note differences between the test server and the production servers).  But that was when I sat down.  Now that I look at the screen, I see Absor, in his rainbow metallic armor and with his handsome duel cowlicks.  As I move the cursor over to choose him for this game session, I notice that I haven't played the evil one in a while, a long while.  I start to think about how much fun it is to watch the pale ones die, knowing that I have the power to heal them, but choose not to…
<br><br>
I lose a lot of play time that way, and I don't have much to start with.
<br><br>
Well, I was thinking of all of that because I was reviewing all of the things that I had wanted to accomplish this week.  And I was noticing that I failed to accomplish most of those things.  I noticed a pattern here that scares me a bit.  The night before last was a good example.  I got home from work, planning on spending the night writing this very editorial and completing an article that I'm (looks at the calendar) about ten days late in finishing.  But as I drove home I started thinking how great it was that I work for the U.S. Government, and how I would be off work the next day.  Even better, a lot of my friends would have the day off as well, and we would be starting another new game.  I then remembered that I needed a lot more work on my character to get ready for the game, and those articles for EQX could wait…
<br><br>
So I get home, flip on the light, flip off my shoes, and head to the computer.  But on the way I see all of the figures that I've set out for painting.  I'm the guy of the group that refuses to spend money on books, but I own hundreds of miniatures.  The new game is going to be yet another trek into the territory of the giants, and I realized that the few giants I owned were unpainted.  So some time during the week I had purchased a few paints and another giant figure for the upcoming game (and you can never have too many really huge figures).  So I sat down to look at them, realizing that I would have to at least assemble (I said it was big!) and primer the new figure before tomorrow morning.
<br><br>
So, character forgotten, articles forgotten, I head into the kitchen for a fresh cup of water for brush cleaning and set to work.  I get the new giant built, when I notice the miniature for the character that I plan to play.  It hits me that I just <b>can't</b> play this complicated and delicate magic-user without organizing the character sheet and all of that before the game, and here I am wasting my time with lead!  (I guess their pewter these days...)  So I set it all aside and went to turn on my computer.
<br><br>
While the computer is booting up, I start watching television.  I have no idea what I watched (television does that to me), but about half an hour later I'm back in the living room with the paints touching up the figure for my character, 'cause his robes never look white enough (maybe I was watching toothpaste commercials).
<br><br>
My night went on like that.  I never actually finished any of those projects.  The garbage disposal still doesn't work, the crack in my car windshield is still there, there's still a pile of laundry in the corner of my room (though my constant pecking at it keeps it at bay)…  There are so many projects that I am 'working on' that I never finish any of them.  And I've discovered something.  It's frustrating.  The sense of accomplishment that I get from finishing something…  well I'm sure there would be a sense of accomplishment, everyone says that there is.  But I rarely get that.  There are plenty of the usual tension building problems with these individual projects.  For months now I've been sitting down to start writing something serious, something that I might actually try to publish (it's Aklar's fault…).  But I can't stay at it long enough to build up an idea.  I never get past the first part of an outline.  I'm either distracted by some other project, or I just can't think of anything at that moment.  The tension mounts, without the benefit of the rewards of success on the last project, because that last project still isn't done.
<br><br>
My boss' boss is good that way.  He really does understand that finishing something can be more important that the thing itself.  When a deadline is set, we meet it.  I have very little frustration about incomplete tasks at work (I've got just one of those on my desk…).
<br><br>
The interesting thing here, to me at least, is that MCD and MTD (Multiple Task Disorder), are so very different.  Sure, there's a little frustration with MCD when you can't decide on a character, or when you realize that you're not keeping up with everyone level-wise.  But there are <b>tons</b> of rewards for playing all of those characters.  I've got…  three characters that I play at the moment.  And each of them is so very different, that no matter my mood, I've got a character.  And I rarely let a good character concept slip past.  I don't regret failing to play some character.  I don't wonder that it would be like to play a Troll Shaman, cause I've got one o dem.  And when I want, I can character hop to play with friends in most areas.  If my inkie pals are on, I can join them (though I'm not going to be of much use, being a bit lower level…).   If my thief pal is on, I can join him.  If the Dorf bunch is on, then they will have to deal with me.  So I can actually put my split personalities to work for me.  And I love playing each of those characters for a different reason, so I can satisfy my particular need of the moment by choosing the right one.
<br><br>
I just need to focus a little more on the tasks.  If I could only get that windshield fixed before I find it in my lap…
