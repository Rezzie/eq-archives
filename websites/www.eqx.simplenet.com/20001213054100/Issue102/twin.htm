Old Man "Children, come listen to my story."
<br><br>
Old Man. "They... 'They' Are not even human! Not even of this land, a different land."
<br><br>
Kallon, "I think I know.... About four years ago I found a boat and sailed it... I was drunk… not knowing where I would end up I fell asleep. When I woke up I was on a shore, I didn't know which shore, I thought maybe Odus, Boy, was I wrong! The next hour or so I was seeing things that were never on any of our known continents! There were Greybacked beasts with horns coming from the nose! It was horrible! I ran, but not to my boat but inland! I ran about five minutes... then blackness. I was lying on the ground with a throbbing pain in my chest. A low hissing was next to me... I jumped up searched my mind for a spell and stopped. What I saw was horrible. There lyin' on the ground was a small gnome. His body old and shriveled... his torso ripped off from his legs.  A small blood trail led down the hallway. I left my prison and walked that way. The smell worsened, The light grew, with every step I became more anxious to run. "RAAGHHH!" A huge lizard came charging at me! I launched my Boom spell directly at it. It fell down began to get up... I walked over and in the bravest voice I said "Who the hell are you?!"
<br><br>
Lizard, "sss...whyss yous hurtss mess like thisssss?"
<br><br>
Kallon, "I thought you were going to kill me."
<br><br>
Lizard, "My name is Sarion, Thess deadss biengss ins theresss, I notss dos."
<br><br>
Kallon, "Who would do that?"
<br><br>
Sarion, " Takasaur, hess doss thatsss!"
<br><br>
Kallon, " Well I would not like to meet him!"
<br><br>
Sarion, "Follow me outta here"
<br><br>
Kallon, " I'm trusting you Sarion."
<br><br>
We left out a secret tunnel. We headed out of the tunnel and through some brush. There in the weeds I saw a huge tower.
<br><br>
Kallon, "What is that?"
<br><br>
Sarion, "That is where we are going."
<br><br>
We scuttled off in the tower's direction. Later we passed a couple of small patrols of some other races that Sarion said were dangerous. Sarion suddenly leaped up and ran out in the open. He turned to look at me and said, "These are the Twin Towers, They belong to my people, see that statue, That is Takasaur, Our ruler.
