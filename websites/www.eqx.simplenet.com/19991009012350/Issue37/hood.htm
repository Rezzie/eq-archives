We've been around since the beginning of time in one form or another.  They've called us many things, from footpad or rogue, to just plain old thief .  However in some rare cases,  many of which are reknowned, they've called us masters.  As one that's been called Master Thief, I feel I'm uniquely qualified to tell you our side of the story as told to me on  rooftops and in dank spaces devoid of light, when one occasionally wonders how one drew this lot in life.
<br><br>
Warriors are strong yes, they meet danger head on in most cases, relying on their strength and the quality of their steel.  As most of us know they aren't always the brightest of souls (no offense meant!).  So if you aren't born big and strong conventional wisdom says you could study magic, there are many legendary sorcerers who have cast their 
way into history.  There are wizards of lore so strong that it took armies to destroy them, and many say they never really died, but are lingering around in lich form doing more damage now than when they were "alive".  So what if you're out of a component, or need time to prepare a spell,  or a coconut falls on your head while casting thus interrupting you, or any number of circumstances that could effect what I consider to be the already unpredictable
nature of magic and you'll see why I don't like it.  Cleric was never a consideration for me as I'm not one that could rely on a god to get what I need to survive...rather get it meself.   No honor in that, you say? So where is the honor in being bigger and stronger than someone? Where is the honor in baking someone in a fireball if they can't fire one back? Everyone looks for any advantage in a fight and will use it when found, rogues just specialize in finding these
advantages and having their bodies and minds trained to react to them.  Be it finding a shadow to hide in or climbing
a sheer face to escape danger,  these are talents learned and can never be taken away.  Backstabbing is as honorable
chopping someone half your size to bits because they can't stop you.   Besides, in the game of survival there are no rules as those of us who have faced death head-on know.

Ah, yes yes, I know..."but what about the assassins"?  I say "what about them"? They have chosen to focus their skills on the darker side of our craft, it doesn't make them all evil sociopaths.  As an old saying I've heard in the guilds goes, "If I show up at your door, chances are you've done something to bring me there".  That's like saying
necromancers give spell-casters a bad name (although I must say that I personally have never met a "nice" necromancer).   Look I'm not saying I donate all of my loot to The Paladins' Adopt a Retired Familiar foundation,
but I am saying that I've never done a party wrong if they were fair with me, and have been told on a multitude
of occasions that my skills alone saved many from certain death.  So all of you doubters go out there and find yourself a rogue, buy said rogue a warm beverage of his or her choice at a local tavern, and tell that person that you
are o.k. with who they are and what they do to get by....just make sure there's a stool in between you.....
