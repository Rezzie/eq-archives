You'd think after all these days traveling together we would either get along or kill each other.  But we continue just as we began…
<br><br>
"Hey, shorty, I'm lookin' for a guy named Absor, you seen 'im?"
<br><br>
<b>…</b>
<br><br>
"HEY!  You deaf!"  Now the tall, muscular Human was standing very close to the Dwarf, who steadfastly ignored the bellowing.  I knew I would have to intervene if this kept up.  Drebben has a very long fuse.  But if that fool Radvar (a term I found I would use often during this journey) kept pushing his luck he would lose a kneecap to the Dwarfs strong grip.  I leaned forward to make certain that I could hear Drebben's grumble, if it came to that.  He always gave a short grumble before he beat someone senseless.
<br><br>
"Shit, ..." I couldn't hear what Radvar muttered under his breath as he left Drebben and approached me, but from the look on Drebben's face, it was not a compliment.  "You, halfling, you know who this Absor is?"
<br><br>
I paused to consider.  I've never been called that before.  There's not a lot of slang that I don't hear, especially if it refers to me.  "Excuse me?"  I acted as simple as I could.  I figured I'd play with this one a bit.  "I don't know any Halflings around here.  Perhaps the barrow district?"
<br><br>
Radvar lowered his already deep voice, an obvious attempt to sound menacing, "Look, I need to find this Absor.  He needs a mercenary, and I need cash.  You know him?"
<br><br>
"Oh, so this Absor is a Halfling.  Perhaps, as I said, the barrow district would…"  I saw the tilt in his head.  I actually thought that he was deciding whether or not to get mad at me for my ignorance.  Almost like he wanted to know if he could beat me, and probably Drebben, before flying off the handle.  I thought it odd at the time.  Now I know better.  I guess he decided that he might take one of us but not both, and to keep control of his temper.
<br><br>
"Look, <em>friend</em>," Radvar has a way of making the kindest words sound nasty when he wants to, "if you can't help me, just say so.  Don't Bristle me.  I have to meet this guy before sunset, and he's supposed to be here someplace.  You two are the only ones here, and so I figure one of ya' might know the guy.  It's almost dark now.  So tell me, do you know where he is?"  He was obviously angry now, but it seemed he had already weighed the odds and he would really have to be pushed to resort to anything physical now.  Drebben was amused by all of this.  I am probably the only non-Dwarf that could tell, though, as his features never changed.  But his stance was relaxed and his breath was shallow, which for Drebben meant that you could not see his chest moving at all.  I'd traveled with him long enough to know the signs.
<br><br>
"No, you look, <em>friend</em>," as a bard I am well trained in making words sound nasty, "I don't appreciate your tone, demeanor, nor your slang.  I assume that 'halfling' is a derogatory term for Half-Elf?  As a mere Human it might be difficult for you to understand, but I don't find it particularly insulting.  As for the job, I'll have to see you in action.  Grab a stick off the woodpile and see if you can even hit Drebben, just once, and I'll pay you double the wage I mentioned.  If Drebben kills you, I pay you nothing.  If you survive and are conscious and ready to leave in the morning, you can have the job at the standard rate."
<br><br>
Radvar turned to look at the Dwarf.  "Alright, Absor.  But if I knock him out, you pay triple.  And if I kill him, you pay me nothing.  It wouldn't do to kill him."  He talked as he walked to the woodpile where Drebben had been leaning.  He picked up a stick, not even bothering to test its strength.  "We're gonna need the little guy to carry our food and water…"
<br><br>
Drebben had been watching Radvar, apparently very casual about the contest.  After all Drebben was strong and fast, even for a Dwarf.  But I could see the fire light in his eyes at the taunt.  It has been said that the Dark Elves use captive Dwarves as pack animals.  Drebben did not take the comment well.  He reached into the pile, grabbing a piece of wood as Radvar had, without checking it's strength.  I knew that Drebben had no intention of letting this one travel with us, even if we needed the help.
<br><br>
The two combatants circled, both holding their sticks in front of them.  Drebbens grip was thumb up, the sort of grip one would use with an axe or club.  Radvar held his palm down and tip tilted back, like one would hold a sword.  It seemed that the man had no familiarity with the club as a weapon and would use it just like he would a blade.  He would lose that way for certain.
<br><br>
"When I beat this munchkin," he said to me, "I'm going to drink the ale he has hidden in his pouches.  And I'll spill a little in the name of Innoruuk."
<br><br>
It is well known that Dwarves hate Innoruuk.  I was shocked that he would say such a thing.  Not that it seemed too crass, not for this Human, but that it seemed foolhardy.  Drebben growled and bared his teeth.  Certainly he would break the Human in half.  He charged, raising the club over his head, making it reach nearly the height of Radvars temple, on a level with his deep green eyes.  As Drebben approached, Radvar retreated, fear obvious on his face.  Radvar tossed the club uselessly at the Dwarf as he turned to flee.  Radvar barely made it up the steps to the small inn, in whose courtyard we were holding our interview.  But his longer legs gave him an advantage in taking those four steps.  Radvars right arm reached out and grasped the post that supported the eves of the inn.  As he stepped onto the porch, he grasped the post with his left hand as well, swinging his entire body up and over the railing and back out from under the eves.  It looked at first that he would be able to escape by simply landing back on the ground and running.  But he did not.  Instead he allowed his momentum to carry him all the way around the post and directly into the surprised and angry Drebben.  Both of Radvars feet landed squarely on the Dwarfs right arm, the one that clutched the large piece of firewood so tightly as to nearly splinter it.  The shock of the blow sent Drebben sprawling into the front door of the inn.  The door yielded with a deafening crash under the weight of the Dwarf.  Drebben disappeared into the relative darkness of the inn.
<br><br>
Radvar backed away from the now vacant doorframe with some caution.  After several seconds of silence, he turned to me and said,  "That's triple pay.  You really should know that Dwarves just ain't that bright.  Too much temper, too little sense.  But you gotta hit them a lot harder than you do an Elf."
<br><br>
I was a bit stunned.  I shouldn't have been, of course.  After all, Humans possess many talents.  Not the least of which is their flexibility.  Where Drebben and I expected a straight out fight, Radvar had improvised.  I knew that I would have to be more careful in my specifications to him in the future.
<br><br>
I gave Radvar a glance and jogged into the inn to check on Drebben…
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The next day dawned brightly and the smell of a fresh fire being stoked at the smithy outside my window woke me with a bit of a start.  Drebben and I had shared a room, more out of habit then out of a need to save money.  Drebben was already awake, and I saw him rubbing his arm.  Radvar had not broken it, but it had swollen to nearly twice its usual size.  Before we came down to breakfast Drebben, who would usually disdain the use of my meager healing skills for such a thing, asked me to help him.  With the blessing of my goddess and the power of my song I was able to reduce the swelling.  Drebben was able to put on his ponderous armor and seemed in little pain.  The first in a series of things these two would do to try to best the other throughout our entire journey.  At first I was amused.
<br><br>
When we came down for breakfast, Radvar was nowhere in sight.  The sun was already up and we had far to go.  I went to the innkeeper and asked which room my hireling was in.  He told me only because it had been my silver that purchased the room.  So I asked the keep to serve myself and Drebben something hot but fast and went up the stairs to pound on Radvars door.  He answered in a gravelly voice that indicated I had awakened him.
<br><br>
"What is it!"  he coughed a bit in a dry fashion.
<br><br>
"We leave in a very short while, get up."
<br><br>
I heard a bit of rustling and a moment later the door opened.  While he did not look clean, nor fully awake, he was ready to leave.  It seemed that perhaps he had not removed his clothing for bed.  But surely he must have, for as he stepped out of the room and opened the door wide enough to get his huge pack and saddle bags out, I saw one of the local ladies turn in the bed.  Apparently she was going to sleep a bit longer.  I wondered what I had missed when I went to bed early last night, yielding the stage to a young Human with a beautiful voice but little training and no real lyrical skill.  I had earned enough with my tales to pay for the rooms and breakfast, and that would be enough.  The rest of the trip was already well funded, though I had to spend several gold from that fund to pay for the repairs on the inn door.
<br><br>
Radvar clumped ungracefully down the stairs before me.  I noticed that his hair was a bit gray.  It must have been a family trait that made it so, for he had certainly lived no more than thirty years.  I again wondered about Humans.  Their lives are very short.  I guess that is what makes them so reckless at times.  And I think that is why the longer-lived races distrust them.  Humans generally rush to conclusions.  This not only makes them foolish, but dangerous as well.  While an Elf might ponder over his options, a Human will decide and act.  It is more likely that the Elf will come to the correct decision.  It is also likely that the Human will have made three more decisions by then.  I smart Human can accomplish a lot in his lifetime.  So perhaps I should treat this Human as if his thirty years were ninety.
<br><br>
At the bottom of the stairs I saw the look on Drebben's face when he met Radvars gaze, and I knew I would have trouble with these two.  Drebben shares with his race many traits.  Not the least of which is stubbornness.  He could tolerate losing to a better fighter.  But he hated being cheated.  I had tried to explain that Radvar had not, technically, cheated in the duel the previous evening.  And Drebben had acquiesced that we would need him and that he could lie and cheat with the best of Humans, a talent we might be able to use.  Despite that, I knew Drebben would not let him go unpunished.  I would be very busy on this trip.  Luckily my talent is with people.  I am often called on to manage groups that would normally kill each other, if not immediately, within days of close proximity.  So far as I know, I am the only man alive that has been asked to negotiate between the Dark Elves and their fair cousins.  That fiasco (though it turned out better than I had expected) was certainly easier than preventing Drebben from getting his dues.
<br><br>
Radvar ate well, as did Drebben.  I always make my first meal on a journey a light one, in preparation for similar meals during my travels.  Therefore I was finished well before the others.  This left me with a bit of time to contemplate the trip.  This would be a tremendous undertaking.  I had been asked four days prior to retrieve a holy relic for the Temple of Light in Qeynos.  I thought it odd enough that the temple would not send a band of its much-vaunted paladins out to seize the thing.  Even odder that it was not a member of the temple that paid me such a large sum to drop this relic into the temple coffers.  If I had not known my backer from previous encounters I would have, like all others do, distrusted her and passed on the offer.  But this lady is of the highest honor.  She has never broken her word to me, nor to any others that I know.  And she trusted me enough to tell me the entire tale, a tale that I was able to verify, and her reasons for wanting to aid the temple and remove the relic from it's current location.  It all made sense to me at the time.  I have never been one to turn away an interesting or important job simply because the one doing the hiring is a Dark Elf.
<br><br>
Of course if Drebben knew that he'd walk out.  Radvar might stay, but without Drebben I figured this job was doomed.  We would need his skill, and his name, for this to work.
<br><br>
After clearing several plates and many goblets of their contents, my companions were finally ready to leave.  Luckily Radvar had his own horse and would not require a stop to purchase one.  We rode out the gates of Qeynos swiftly.  I waved to the guards as we left, but typically stoic they refused to respond.  I took that as a good sign.  If things remained predictable this would work out just fine.  I was very prepared for what I expected.  It was the unexpected that, as usual, would muck up my plans.
