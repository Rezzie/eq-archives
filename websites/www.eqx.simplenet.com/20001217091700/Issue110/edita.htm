This is a tough editorial to write.  I think most of us have been touched by some of the people that we've met in EverQuest, or in the EverQuest community.  Maybe someone made you laugh once while you were meditating and you've always remembered that.  Or maybe you, like me, have made friends with people that you chat with in newsgroups about EverQuest.  Or perhaps the members of your guilds start to feel like family.  On-line games can do that.  To me it's one of their most fascinating features.
<br><br>
Several weeks ago a received a letter from someone that I've never met.  He told me that he had just found out about EverQuest Express.  He liked it, and he wanted to write something for us.  Maybe it's best if I just show you the letter.

<blockquote><em>Subject: Possible Submission
<p style="text-align: justify">
I have not been following EQX long, but in the short time I have been following your online newspaper I have become very interested in submitting some of my own material. I'm not certain I will submit often enough to ask to be a staff member, but I am happy simply being a contributor, so that shouldn't be a problem. Where my problem lies is in the submission. I'm not certain it's appropriate, or fits with the direction you want your publication to go. Before I spent the time and energy to write an article I wanted to run the idea of it by you for approval. I am not asking you to say "Yes, I'll 100% definitely publish your work." I just want to know if you will 100% NOT publish my work due to the subject matter.
<br><br>
I am considering writing an article along the lines of EQ as therapy, or something along those lines. Here's the situation. I have been diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease. This is a cancer that attacks the Lymphatic system. I have undergone both Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy, both of which were unsuccessful. I have been diagnosed terminal, and most likely will not be here this time next year. The cancer has done a great amount of damage to my lower back and pelvis, so I can no longer walk, or even stand, due to extreme pain. I am bedridden and really have nothing to do, nowhere to go. Because of this I spend a great deal of my time in Everquest. I want my article to focus on the good things EQ brings to my life. The people I meet, the adventures I go on, etc.
<br><br>
I'm more or less concerned that this deals with issues that possibly are a little more "real" than you want EQX to address. If you have no problem publishing this type of material, great. I'll get started and submit it when it's finished. On the other hand, I would really appreciate some forewarning if this is something you definitely do not want to publish. It will save both of us quite a lot of time and energy.
<br><br>
Thanks!<br>

Robert brought to light something that I had never really thought much about.  For some people, in some unfortunate and perhaps just plain terrible circumstances, the contacts and friendships that they make over the Internet and through games like EverQuest are a sort of lifeline.  For many of us these lifelines are our friends, people that we've known for a while, people that we've sat around with on weekends for the last twenty years.  For most of us these lifelines don't need to be particularly strong, as we don't need them.  For us they are more like safety nets.  Something that we like having but never really plan to use.  For me the friends that I have over the net are wonderful additions to my life.  I'm grateful for them, I'm glad they're there.  But I've got a fair number of other people to hang out with.  So if I'm off-line for a few days I can always hang out with my other friends; go to a movie; have dinner; play games.
<br><br>
But what about those that have little or no chance to meet people in their real lives?  What about someone that is bedridden due to illness or accident?  I can only imagine how much more important on-line friendships can be for people in these situations.
<br><br>
Being able to log into EverQuest and forget your real life problems is a nice thing.  And the bigger your real life problems, the nicer it is to be able to forget them for a few hours.
<br><br>
Robert's mother wrote me a letter this week.  She wrote to tell me that her son had died.
<br><br>
I only knew him from that one letter.  It sure is strange how strongly the news of his death struck me, how such slight contact with someone that I will never meet could mean so much.  Maybe it was simply the fact that we shared a common hobby.  Perhaps it was the wonderful tone of his letter, or how his mother explained to me that he was looking forward to writing that article for us.  It might have been how much I was looking forward to that article.  Or it might have been the loss of another kind soul from the world.
<br><br>
I don't know what I expect to get across to you with this editorial.  I just needed to tell you this story.
