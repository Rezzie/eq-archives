"Arise Hysslak, we have decided."
<br><br>
The leaden tones of the Head Judicator resounded strangely throughout the field of bone, amplified to an otherworldly level by the hollow bones of the first children of Veeshan, their spirits passed from the world ages ago.  A faint glimmer of hope flashed across the warrior's features, only to be extinguished by the somber faces of the High Council members.  
<br><br>
"For the murder of your sword brothers we expel you from the Talons of the Wyrm,  banish you from these lands for all eternity, and you shall be Marked, so that all may know your shame.  Take him away."
<br><br>
Hysslak fell to his knees, stunned.  Two guards came forward, lifted him by his arms, and dragged him down a corridor into the prison.  Upon arriving at an empty cell, his captors sent him sprawling into the dank room with a harsh kick.  As the floor quickly rose to greet him, Hysslak slipped out of consciousness.
<br><br>
It had all started out a week earlier when a battered and bleeding messenger came running into town,  begging to see the High Council with urgent news.   After the residing shamans had healed him, he was granted an audience with the High Council.  According to the messenger, a ship filled with strange creatures had landed upon the northern shores of Kunark, and these new creatures had swarmed upon a small fishing village, slaying all but the messenger, who was saved from the arrow that was meant to slay him by his thick scales.  The messenger gave such an odd description of the things that had attacked that the High Council had him examined to make sure his brush with death had not driven him mad.  The messenger told of scale less creatures, with skin as pink and tender as a newborn rat's, but these things were taller than a man, and had with them warriors of great skill that slaughtered with ease.  
<br><br>
The High Council had immediately dispatched a patrol of the elite Talons of the Wyrm to deal with these strange invaders.  The whole town came out to cheer Hysslak and his men to swift victory.    They traveled with high hearts, so confident in their victory that they began betting each other who would kill the most of these "Humans."  Within two days they reached what was left of the village.  Some of the most hardened warriors of the group vomited at the sight of what had been done to the innocent villagers.  Parts of what must be assumed corpses were strewn everywhere, and everything of any value that could not be carried had been destroyed.  Those of the group with stronger stomachs gave the townspeople a swift final rite, sending their spirits up to Veeshan with the flames of a funeral pyre, and then they all swore a blood oath to avenge the deaths of the townspeople.  One of the scouts found the track of the invaders, and the group rushed after with new determination to stop the humans.  
<br><br>
They came upon the humans in the black of night, and in a brutal charge out of the darkness they exacted a horrible vengeance on the surprised humans.  Suddenly the night was lit like day, and a lizard man fell, engulfed in supernatural flames.  The rest of the warriors stood stunned.  How could these heathens control the holy power of magick, a gift reserved for only the most favored of Veeshan's priests?  Taking advantage of their shock, the human magi destroyed one fighter after another with their dark magic, until a human, seemingly the leader, stepped forward and muttered a spell.  Hysslak's arms raised of their own accord, and to his horror, the magi took full control Hysslak's body, leaving the poor lizard man a horrified spectator as his own body slew his comrades.  
<br><br>
After he had slaughtered every remaining lizard with Hysslak's body, the magi laughed and cast another spell that sent Hysslak flying. Then all the magus walked off into the trees laughing about their exploits, and exclaiming over the amount of money all the things they had stolen from the fallen would bring in back on Antonica.  When a second patrol found the battle site, the only living soul they could find was Hysslak, weeping over the corpse of his best friend Sslakwys.  They brought Hysslak back to the city, where he was made to stand trial for what had to be assumed were his murders, for even Hysslak himself could not deny that it was his hands that slew many of his brethren upon that field.
<br><br>
"Get Up.  Now."
<br><br>
A bucket of ice water forced Hysslak into the present, and he was led out into town square, where he was forced to the ground.  A masked warrior drew his sword and severed Hysslak's tail, then burned the stump so that his tail could never regrow.  He was then led to the city gates and forced out into the wilderness, never to return upon pain of death.  
<br><br>
Hysslak wandered down the dusty path an outcast, with nowhere to stay, and nothing to call his own, and only one goal - to rid the world of the scourge called Human.
