	Lying upon the half rotten mattress, Caleb was certain of only one thing and that was that he was dying. Throughout his life he thought that when the time came, he would fear it, fight it off, or find some way to deny that it was taking place. His life had never been one of certainty or stability… what sailors ever was? From the spires of Erudin to the piers of Freeport, there was not a stretch of ocean or isolated islet in which a man or woman could not find themselves a grave.
<br><br>
	Once, in a particularly fierce storm, he had been thrown from the forecastle to the deck, and for the rest of his days the limp which he walked with reminded him of the incident. It also reminded him of how worse it could have been, for his companion had been thrown overboard in that very same storm. They made all the appropriate prayers, all the traditional offerings, but the sea does not give up it's dead so easily. He was never found.
<br><br>
	Closing his eyes, he thought about what it would be like. The pain until now had been excruciating, and he believed it would as the Artificers had explained in their doctrine, that the body as a machine would begin to fail, and only when it was finally beyond repair would it be released from all it's functions. He was fairly certain that whatever waited for him, it could be no more cruel than the fever which was sapping not only his strength, but his will as well.
<br><br>
	Opening his eyes a sliver, even the flickering candle which illuminated his cabin seemed as bright as the sun itself, Caleb tried to gasp. It came out as a hacking cough. They were leagues away from the shore, there was no way that this could be possible.
<br><br>
	"Merinda?"
<br><br>
	"I am here, and there is nothing left to fear…"
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	"I tell you sir, straight out and now, that if this much longer keeps up, there be not a one who'll be left the sail for the next shipment."
<br><br>
	Patrician nodded to the little man who spoke with the sailor's lilt. He brushed the sleeves of his velvet frock coat, pulled at the white lace cuffs, and examined the tar stained piece of canvas which covered the perfect outline of a human body. He shook his head, smiling slightly at the thought of the sailor next to him. Service to the Militia often marked a man in many subtle ways, but Patrician was not one of them. His rich, dark brown hair betrayed no hint of his advancing years, flowing down to the collar of his vest in waves, and his green eyes sparked with intensity. He had no doubt that the sailor had been expecting some bored functionary or hard nosed member of the Militia. 
<br><br>
	"Really, do you think I would be here if the Guard did not think this was of some importance?"
<br><br>
	The little man shook his head, stringy brown hair whipping about as he did so.
<br><br>
	"No no no sir, that said I did not at all, it's just that it's long been a time since the Militia sir has been interested a bit in what goes on down here…"
<br><br>
	Patrician sniffed, lifting the corner of the canvas with the tip of his hard soled riding boot. 
<br><br>
	"A fever? Preceded by dizziness and general lassitude?"
<br><br>
	"Sir?"
<br><br>
	Patrician brought a hand to his face, "Was he tired and off balance?"
<br><br>
	"Yes sir, days we were into the trip, and he bitched, pardon sir, he complained loud long and all about how his eyes were on fire. We found on the floor him we did, the sixth or seventh day out. Died in his cabin just the day before today he did, and the courier we had aboard with us, he sent word to the Militia he did."
<br><br>
	Patrician nodded, and turned from the canvas covered body. His eyes rested upon The Harlequin, a three masted merchant ship registered to Freeport which sat at the end of the pier. Bored looking longshoreman heaving barrels over the side into the bay. Whatever sickness had overtaken the sailor, the authorities could not risk its spread into the city. The cargo of fine wine from Erudin, worth thousands, was now destined for the silty bottom of the harbor. The sailors were confined to their ship, apart from the weasel of a captain. The Priests of Erollisi Marr had confirmed that whatever had befallen the ship, it had not spread to the man who commanded it.
<br><br>
	"Well, commit this particular soul to the deep, and I will get back to you within a few days."
<br><br>
	"Sir?"
<br><br>
	"I do not have time to stand here arguing with you, just do it. Someone will be down to speak with you later."
<br><br>
	Patrician stalked off towards the harbour masters office, wondering exactly why he had been assigned to deal with this particular problem.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	"Because I asked you to, old man"
<br><br>
	Smirking, Patrician sniffed at the glass of wine in his hand. Across from him, Ingival was paring his fingernails with a stiletto, his pinched features, long tapering nose and wispy goatee reminding him as always of a rat.
<br><br>
	"I dare say I should be the one giving you the orders… Captain."
<br><br>
	Ingival snorted, "No need for sarcasm, finger waggler. The Militia knows its business, and that business has me in charge of the docks.  You, you're a book banging fop the captain retains for reasons only the devils themselves can fathom. If I tell you to suck on a dead man's balls, you'll do it and like it. You're a corpse caster, a Necromancer, and all I need to know is that you were asked into this situation because you prefer the cold, loose lips of a dead whore to living flesh."
<br><br>
	Patrician looked over the rim of his glass at Ingival, an eyebrow
raised quizzically. 
<br><br>
	"You're fairly certain of yourself Captain… tell me, if I am so
desperately loathed, why even stomach my presence?"
<br><br>
	The Captain of the Guard snorted, then spat into the straw which
covered the floor next to the table.
<br><br>
	"Because I was ordered to."
<br><br>
	"Charming…"
<br><br>
	"Isn't it?"
<br><br>
	An uncomfortable silence followed the air between the two men thick with tension and barely restrained anger. The sound of footsteps, hard boots against damp cobblestone, punctured the silence, and Ingival rose from his seat.
<br><br>
	"My dealings with you are finished, necromancer. One of my men has been assigned to assist you with this particular case. I haven't time in the day to go chasing after dead sailors whose lives matter not a whit to even their own mothers. I'll expect your report in a week."
<br><br>
	Ingival opened the door, surprising the lithe young man whose arm was raised, ready to grasp the handle. His close cropped hair, shaved nearly to the scalp and leaving only blonde stubble, was indication enough that he was one of the Militia. The polished black boots, and the grey breeches tucked into the top, completed the impression. Even though he wore a torn and tar stained tunic, evidently a feeble attempt to mix in with the sailors on the docks, the youth reeked of refined nobility.  Possibly a squire to one of the Militia's more important officers.
<br><br>
	"Aron, that finely dressed fop over there is Patrician. Whatever you have on these waterlogged carcasses, you share. EVERYTHING. Am I clear on that?"
<br><br>
	Aron glanced over at Patrician nervously, then looked up at Ingival. 
<br><br>
	"Clear sir."
<br><br>
	Patrician finished off the wine in his glass. Things were definitely going to prove interesting, and for all the wrong reasons.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Scattered shafts of reddish light stabbed through a cloudy and altogether uninviting dawn. The feeble light was more than enough to rouse Patrician from the filthy straw mattress upon which he had spent the night. Splashing stale, brackish water onto his face from the basin on the nightstand, he struggled to his feet. Throughout the night, he had been considering exactly why he had been chosen for this assignment.  It made no logical sense, no matter how he managed to turn the idea over in his head. Even a late evening walk had failed to dispel the confusion. Certainly, events of the last few weeks would disrupt trade, perhaps cause problems with the dealings between Erudin and Freeport, but it was insignificant. Sailors died all the time on the long journey. Scurvy, rickets, dropsy, any one of a number of exotic diseases no one had come to understand, all could be experienced in the course of a three week voyage across the ocean. Why were these deaths any different?
<br><br>
	An ear splitting hammering assaulted Patrician's ears. Hands over his ears, he shook his head. It was then that he realized that someone was knocking on the door.
<br><br>
	"Patrician? It's Aron. We've got another at the docks…"
<br><br>
	 Patrician sighed, brushing bits and pieces of straw from his vest, and pulling the frock coat from its place on the bedpost.
<br><br>
	"I shall be along presently…"
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Aron kicked the corpse with the toe of his boot, his face set with a determined frown.
<br><br>
	"They pulled him out of his quarters not more than twenty minutes ago. He was on watch on a ship called The Sea Queen, one of ours. Captain tells me he's been out of sorts since they docked, just after The Harlequin came in. His watch was last night, but he wasn't feeling well so a friend of his covered for him."
<br><br>
	Patrician looked down at the corpse, it's eyes open, staring intently at something just beyond the perception of human sight. A faint hint of a smile locked on the edges of the lips.
<br><br>
	"Anything unusual Aron?"
<br><br>
	The guardsman shrugged, pulling a dagger out from his belt.
<br><br>
	"Nothing except the smile. I've seen my fair share of the dead, but they're not usually happy about it."
<br><br>
	Patrician smirked, "You might be surprised. I was thinking more of the manner of their deaths…"
<br><br>
	"How do you mean?"
<br><br>
	"Do you see any sores? Pustules? Signs of illness or disease?"
<br><br>
	Aron knelt beside the corpse and carefully examined the face and the arms. Using the tip of his dagger, he lifted the man's night shirt, looking for any sign of disease.
<br><br>
	"Not a sight of it…"
<br><br>
	"Exactly… not even a lost tooth, from the looks of things. I am not sure how familiar you are with such things Aron, but disease is seldom so forgiving as to leave little sign upon the dead."
<br><br>
	"That doesn't bring us any closer to answers. Can't you just reach in and tear out the answers using magic? You're a corpse talker, can't you ask his spirit to reveal the means of his death?"
<br><br>
	Smiling, Patrician shook his head, "It's hardly so easy as all that… Necromancy is an art like any other magic, and the more complex the art one attempts to create, the longer the preparations. Would you ask a painter to provide you with a portrait on the spot? To speak with the dead, one needs to know the dead… his name, his past, his family, what tied him to this world, where he might be found as a result in the next. Without that, it would be like casting an unbaited hook into the sea in the hopes of landing a clam."
<br><br>
	The young guard shrugged, placing the dagger back into his belt. Walking around the corpse, he stopped, and dropped down to one knee. Lifting the corpses left arm, the length of the forearm covered with a makeshift bandage, he sniffed the air and winced.
<br><br>
	"Well, he's got himself rather a nasty bit of business going on under that bandage, that's certain enough." Moving next to Aron, the Necromancer passed his hand over the bandage, muttering a short, angry sounding phrase as he did so.
<br><br>
"Flesh as well might be rotting off the arm. Whatever did kill him, it beat the infection by a few days at best."
<br><br>
"You think it might mean something?"
<br><br>
Patrician sniffed, "Something, or nothing at all. Sailors don't exactly lead the most charmed of lives. I do believe you might want to speak with the captain of The Harlequin, though, and ask about the circumstances surrounding the death of that other sailor. Something he
might not have thought important. Did he cut himself shaving one
morning? Have himself an accident while making his way to the privy?
Anything."
<br><br>
Aron nodded, turning towards the harbour masters office.
<br><br>
"And tell that snake Ingival he may need to book us passage … whatever is taking place, it would seem to start somewhere at sea."
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
Rain spattered against the tar soaked canvas, rivulets draining off its surface onto the cobbled streets. While it offered little protection against the rain, it was better than nothing, at least that's what Kelric kept telling himself. Three days and more he'd spent in the streets of Blacksand, waiting for his ship to finish taking on supplies.  When they first docked, he'd been philosophical about the money he'd lost to Benton and Diggs at tossers. After all, they'd be off again soon enough, and it meant only he'd have less for drink and none for women. He hadn't counted on the problems they had with the Freeport Port Authority, and he hadn't thought at all about what he'd have to pay for lodgings in the event they weren't allowed back on the ship.  As it was, they were due to leave the next morning, for which he was eternally thankful. He was sure that one more day in the streets of this cursed backwater would kill him, or at the best leave him with an eternity of sneezing fits.
<br><br>
The sky lit up, everything momentarily illuminated in contrasting shades of sharp white and deepest black. Thunder rolled over the Port district, echoing in the narrow streets and alleys.
<br><br>
Standing, pulling the canvas tarp tighter around him, Kelric decided that sneaking back on board would certainly be worth the attempt at least. He'd take a flogging happily if it meant keeping himself dry for at least one night before they left. Sneezing violently, he staggered off to wards the docks.
<br><br>
From the alley, a figured slipped out into the street, oblivious to the weather, intent only on it's prey.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
Patrician held a hand to his head, poking idly at the grey slab of beef on the plate in front of him. Truly, if this is what sailors had to endure on their travels, was it any wonder that many of them simply dropped dead? Aron sat across from him, barely more interested in the salted pork which he had unwisely decided upon for breakfast. Pushing the plate aside, Aron pulled out a sheaf of papers.
<br><br>
"Well, it seems there was more to that fellow who died on the Harlequin. These were found in his quarters. For a sailor, he was a fairly literate man. Seems that while he hadn't suffered any serious injuries that you'd notice, he'd been suffering from headaches and nausea a lot since a fall he'd had aboard the ship a month previous."
<br><br>
	Patrician looked up from his pathetic side of beef, an eyebrow raised in curiosity.
<br><br>
	"Indeed? The mysteries of the mind are many, but of one thing I am certain, and that is men can die from such blows, and not always the
moment it's struck."
<br><br>
	Aron nodded, "I'm no expert on the dead, but there was a guard who broke up a tavern brawl one night, and he'd been rung upside the head fairly badly by someone with a length of wood. He seemed fine, but he died about a month later, all the while complaining about his headaches and such."
<br><br>
	Patrician nodded, "And I am certain that if we were to look deeply into all the deaths which have occurred over the past few weeks, we would find much the same pattern… which is hardly a pattern at all. These types of injuries, these kinds of deaths, occur all the time. What makes these any different than ones suffered the year previous?"
<br><br>
	Aron shrugged, "Nothing, that I can see. Unrelated injuries, which may or may not have caused death, and by coincidence, they take place on the same trade route, it hardly seems a job for one such as yourself… or myself for that matter."
<br><br>
	Patrician smiled, "You would think so, wouldn't you? Did you book passage for us? If there are answers to be had in this, I don't think we will be finding them on the shore."
<br><br>
	"Aye, we leave at first light tomorrow morning."
<br><br>
	The necromancer sighed, "It always has to be at first light…"
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Kelric sat in his hammock, clutching his sides in the hope that doing so would prevent the fire in his belly from spreading further. It was a vain hope, he knew, the moment he began sneezing, he'd lose control of himself, and the pain would intensify even further. Only the mercy of Diggs had kept him from earning the Captain's wrath on top of what he was experiencing now. Diggs had felt responsible for Kelric's condition.  After all, if Kelric hadn't been cheated out of his pay at a crooked game of chance, he wouldn't have caught the fierce fever which he was suffering under. And whatever else might be said, Diggs had at least some of his conscience left. And so he saw to it that Benton covered Kelric's duties as much as possible, and that if the Captain inquired as to the sick sailor's whereabouts, there was always an excuse. The captain preferred to keep to his cabin on these trips, and not a single member of the crew could remember a time when he went below decks once cargo was in place, so there was little chance he would find out where Kelric really was.
<br><br>
	Diggs left a piece of hardtack and a half mug of grog on a crate next to Kelric's hammock and made his way through the hold. While Kelric might not be missed, if Diggs were gone any longer, the Bosun might come hunting for him.
<br><br>
	Occupied as he was with returning to his duties, Diggs never noticed the shadowy figure which passed between the rolled bolts of cloth and the crates. And Kelric was in no condition to notice the figure which stood a few feet away from him, hovering over him as would a vulture.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Aron stood with his hands on the rail, watching the trackless, featureless ocean with amazement. For all the time he had spent in Blacksand, he'd never set foot upon a ship of any kind, let alone sailed to a foreign port of call. He watched the seagulls circling over a patch in the ocean, and he briefly wondered what kinds of birds they would find in Erudin. As absorbed as he was in his thoughts, he did not notice the Necromancer until he spoke.
<br><br>
	"A far cry from the sky in the Freeport, is it not?
<br><br>
	"Aye… you've been to sea before?"
<br><br>
	Patrician nodded, "More than a few times, although it is hardly my preferred mode of travel. It is at times a necessity. At sea, you can look out over the ocean and not see anything but the waves in any direction. In Freeport, if you can see past a city block often means you can see too much."
<br><br>
	"I can see the appeal in this life, hard though it might be. For a man living in the slums, this must seem a freedom unlike any other…"
<br><br>
	Patrician nodded, looking out towards the horizon, "Every man seeks his release in a different way. Some haunt the streets, some take to the sea, others bury themselves within their chosen line of work."
<br><br>
	"You're not like the last corpse talker I worked with. He was always on and on about the transience of life, or some such nonsense. Not a one at all to spend time talking about naught but bile and blood and the dead."
<br><br>
	Patrician continued staring out at the waves, "It is always said that we are interested only in matters of passing beyond this life into another. I am forever interested in how many believe it to be true. Men die every day, and when it strikes at a time deemed inconvenient, or with the aura of mystery, they come to the 'corpse talkers'", Patrician spat over the rail, "Look! They shout. A thing profane to be solved. An evil to be undone. A horror to be protected against. When do they learn that sometimes, however, men just die?"
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Kelric's breathing was laboured, the sound from his chest that of naked branches against dead trees. Through the haze of his fever and the sting in his muscles he knew that the time he had left was short, and that he would not last the night.
<br><br>
	He knew the moment had come as the indistinct form made it's way towards him, gliding across the deck. Surely this was death, come to collect him.
<br><br>
	"Nana?"
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Aron slowly drew the knife from the top of his boot, certain that what he was hearing was not banter between two sailors. For one thing, there wasn't a curse to be heard, and in his days aboard the ship, that alone marked the meeting in the hold as unusual. For a few brief seconds, he contemplated waking the Necromancer, but there would be little time for that. His cabin was on the opposite end of the hold and a deck above, and whatever was taking place could end at any moment.
<br><br>
	Aron removed his boots and opened the door to his cabin. Blackness, with only the shadowy, indistinct forms of crates and barrels. The sound was clearer now, and he recognized it for what it was. Breathing.  Forced, irregular, the breath of a dying man. However, there was something else, lower, deeper, and more regular. Almost a chant.
<br><br>
	Padding across the deck, heel to toe so as not to make a sound, he crept through the maze of cargo towards the sound. There was little light, and the forms were indistinct. A man, slung in a ships hammock was just ahead. On the opposite side of the hammock, a gaunt form stood, buried in the shadows, standing over the dying man.
<br><br>
	The man in the hammock reached up with a hand,"Nana?"
<br><br>
	Patrican stepped forward, placing his hand over the dying man's face.
<br><br>
	"I am here, and there is nothing left to fear..."
