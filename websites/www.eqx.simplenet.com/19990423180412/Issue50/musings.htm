Sometimes when I'm thinking about characters that I have created or want to create, I try to write something that tells me something about them.  I have no idea if these will hold any interest to any of our readers.  They are not really stories, they are just little blurbs that came to mind one day when I was trying to flesh out a few character ideas.  As the release of EverQuest nears I guess it is my desire to show you one of the ways that I develop a character.  Take them any way you want.

<em>"Many of my people brag that they have been granted the best traits of their parents.  Perhaps.  But we also bear the burden of that heritage.  Neither Humans nor Elves love us, yet we must find our way in their society.  Often enough this isolation breaks our spirit.  We have never found our own society, and therefore can find no place to call home.  But for some, myself included, this has been a blessing.  We are not restricted by racial boundaries, and have the pleasure to claim all of Norrath as home."</em>

<em>I get darned tired of hearing "Oh, it's just a human…" when I apply for work in this stinkin' city.  I may be human, but I can kick yer wide Dwarven butts across this tiny room.  And I can reach the top shelves, too…"</em>

"<em>Hee heee..  wooooo, ..  tickles!  Stop squirmin', you make Ogg spill beer!</em>"  Battle cry of Ogg, Ogre.
