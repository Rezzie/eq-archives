  Don't worry.  Probly was coin...co-insi… just unlucky accident  that she died right when you wave.  Was she barshin' someting? Was she sickie-looking?  So do not worry bout it.  
<br><br>
  P.S.  Can you send Moog some of your doerderant?  Scunks hard to find where Moog live.

<b>Dear Anon,
<br><br>
   Moog feels that luv knows no races.  So he just barshes whoever he wants on head with luvstones.  (old Troll myth…romantik, eh?)  But don't marry no one because they cute.  Marry cause you gonna like them when cute wears off.

<em>Dear Aunti Moog,
<br><br>
Is it possible to know more about the lady on the presentation screen when loading the game, which is the same one on the cover of the box and manual? Was the artist inspired by someone real? If so, is it possible to know her name and if a portfolio of her real picture is available somewhere? Thank you

Dear Darvin
<br><br>
Moog don't think much of Ranger who can't even capatalize his god's name!  Bring it on, little man.  Moog will eat you!  Or not.  What race are you?  If you wood elfie…maybe Moog just keep you as pet.   Wood elfie are cute…

<em>Vendui' Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
 I am what the lesser races call..umm what is common tongue word..necromancer of the 7th spell circle. I have dedicated my life to growing in power and hatred for the other races, ogres and trolls with exception of course, and living to be in service to the Father Innoruuk. 
<br><br>
  The other night I was returning to my home of Neriak after a long travel when I passed by this beautiful human necromancer. I was so stunned that I stopped in my tracks and admired her for some time as she and her pet killed some unfortunate. Being invisible at the time she never noticed me but I must have just stood there at that spot until she left on her way. Ever since then I couldn't help but think of her, but also feeling like I'm betraying my beliefs as well. What should I do??

Dear Very Confused
<br><br>
Oh, oh, Moog see that you been barshed hard with luvstone!  Well, lots ting you can do now.  You can go try to forget her.  You can try to find her.  If she worships Innoruuk, then no problems.  If not…well, you could barsh her til she switch to Innoruuk, or kill her and make her your pet.  Then you have her forever!
