    <p style="text-align: justify"><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      I am a beginning enchanter and very much enjoy playing tricks on people. 
      (e.g. turning into a cactus at the entrance to Freeport and calling people's 
      names without moving, they look around and ask lots of stupid questions, 
      then they run around and ask lots of stupid questions, and then they get 
      bored and stop thinking that it was something wrong with the world and then 
      I do it again) turning invisible and annoying the heck out of da udder finger 
      wigglrs. Oops sorry, you're language is sorry of catchy (though my spelling 
      needs fine-tuning). I turn into a humungous pile of uhm, guck in Freeport 
      occasionally or do my bashies as a tree. However, as you may know Oxesiess, 
      the higher level characters just get bored with this sort of stuff, state 
      "Enchanter, hmmmph..." and then just walk off. I was wondering, can you 
      think of any other sort of tricks I can play on the nose-in-the-air types? 
      Especially on the Erudites/wiggler types who have their fingers stuck up 
      their uhm, (that stinky place) anyways? (when, of course, they aren't wiggling. 
      You have to assume they get confused sometimes and end up, for instance, 
      casting spells like firebolt before taking their fingers out of their uhm,... 
      anyways 'nuff said)<br>

      I's got a question fer yahs. I was wonderin' why everybody wants to ge Married??!! 
      I jus doan understand it! yahs - even I have been asked. I's wants to tell 
      yah's to get yer think on the matter.I's a half Elf Ranger. yeppers - My 
      mammy was a Wood elf see and my daddy was a Barb - EmeraldWarrior. That's 
      why I talk so good! Anywho - I's in my 6th seson of bashing and had run 
      accross a banit camp. So I's start bashin and bashin and I was doin ok until 
      2 more bandit come runnin' up to get in on the fun. Ruined my day it did. 
      I's start gettin really bloody and woozy and bleedin' all over - almost 
      to die when here come a really pretty basher - he had shiny armor from head 
      to toe and he a good finger wiggler too! He healed me...an he was an elfie! 
      He an' some frien come to share the bash with me. An' we bash bandits fer 
      some time an he stiks really close...yeppers - and he get's to lookin' at 
      my hind funny and wantin' to go off to an empty tent. Whell I's glad he 
      saves me an all but he's startin' ta git on my last nerve...yah kno...so 
      I tell's 'em to knock it off or I'd half to bash him, hero or no hero. So's 
      he gits on one knee and give me a ring and tells me he wants to barsh only 
      wi' me. An I didn't want to hurt him or anythang...but he keeps tryin' to 
      get me to the tent...an I really doesnt kno all ta important stuff....so 
      I say 'aye' but not until I's in 8th season barsh an I join my sisters, 
      the Amazons of Vallen Zek. That it was kinda sudden-like. I's not that kinda 
      elfie - nope, I's good girl! So we's bash some more - and then we both part 
      ways. Well, that was 2 seasons ago an' I haven't seen him since. I tink 
      maybe he find bad elfie to go off with and fergit 'bout me an the ring he 
      gave me. Well, I look an look for him - but can't find 'em to give back 
      the ring. What you think Oxesiess? I tink maybe he git heated up wile bashing 
      them bandits and thinkin' I's lookin' good. What kin I do?</font></i>

      Oh! Ya's a Wolf o da North iffen I's ever saw one! I dunno why everyone 
      wants ta git married. Ya's know I done have two hero's and stuff. Dunno

      in all o bashy desipte ya's didn't killed somethin dat lived lots ago dat

      now-da-days. I's would'n worry bout dat guy and ring and thingys like dat. 
      Why, I's done had two barbs dat kinda talked ta me dat way, and one still 
      bashy's wiff me. Ayeps even called me HIS hero! Fancy dat! Da Oxes considered 
      a Hero! Me Ma and Paw would be soooo proud. I thinky dat ring must not o 
      meant to stinky much iffen he done run off and not said no more. I mean 
      jist cause ya's dunt wanna name him da ONLY hero.. dat means ya's dunt need
