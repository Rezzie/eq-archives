Innothule- Deep in Innothule swamp, more has been stirring than just the
Trolls. Frogloks and Kobolds have been seen gathering in large groups. The
campfires blaze until dawn, and the Trolls are starting to become a tad
uneasy. Grobb is well protected, but an invasion by both the Frogloks and
the Kobolds would put a strain on the Troll defenses. With hopes of
fortifying the entrance to Grobb even more, messengers have been sent out to
deliver word to hunting parties that have traveled to various points in
Antonica. Word has also been sent to Oggok and Neriak, with hopes of uniting
the dark races against these foes.
<br><br>
Oggok- The outbreak of humans, elves and various other races in the Feerrott
has spread the Ogre bouncers thin. Rumor has it that the good races are
trying to take over Cazic Thule's temple, in an effort to reduce the evil
that shrouds the southern portion of Antonica. Not only are the ogres having
constant lizard problems, now they have to deal with warriors from abroad
trying to tear down their temples. Having recieved word from Grobb that the
Frogloks and Kobolds are gathering, the Ogres are becoming frightened that
their live's may be changing for the worst.<br><br>

	NERIAK, FOREIGN QUARTER - Today the group known as the F'leurs DuMal was
again responsible for aggression against the residents of the Foreign
Quater.  With the aid of their necromancer, Fuerlespit, the group let loose
over 30 undead skeletons which rampaged through the Quarter, killing
visitors and human residents alike.
<br><br>
	Tdaven H'yonith, the infamous poet and spokesman for the group, said "It
will take ages for us to clean the stink of the animal races from Neriak.
Next time, we'll give our skeleton minions mops and buckets."
	The group has gained adherents in the last week, allegedly numbering
seven, including Tdaven, his sister Tdanye, Fuerlespit, the cleric Gainam,
Nuuin the warrior, and Ezmend the enchanter.

<b>Late breaking news:</b>
<br><br>
An addition story has come to light in the darkness of Neriak.  It appears that the 
Dark Elves may have come up with an altogether new method in the ways of Necromancy.
