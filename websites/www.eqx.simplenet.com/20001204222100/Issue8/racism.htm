	<big><big>E</big></big>lves hate Orcs and Drow.  Dwarves Hate Elves, Orcs, Goblins and Drow. Orcs hate everybody.  Is Norrath a world of bigots?  Why would anyone choose to live in a world with virulent hatred and intolerance turned inward to all others?  Of course not ALL elves hate orcs.. or do they?  It seems pretty acceptable to a good race to hate an evil race, right?
	<br><br>
	But wait! Isn’t any form of bigotry abhorrent?  Shame on those who would denigrate another simply on the basis of his/her membership in a specific race!  This is the 90’s, isn’t it?… and we are far too advanced to be bigots or racists.
	<br><br>
	Something that has always fascinated me about fantasy gaming is the acceptance or dismissal of racial intolerance.  Most players don’t bother to role-play racial intolerance.  Since when has anyone *really* looked at those racial intolerance charts in AD&D’s Unearthed Arcana?  Most claim that their character is the "exception" to the rule or was raised from infancy by the hated race (or some other dodge) and so has gone beyond these intolerances.  This may be an excuse to avoid playing a bigot, something no one likes to consider.  If everyone is the "exception" then who is the "rule"?

Some do play these intolerances, but they are the "easy" ones to role-play, like elves vs. orcs, or dwarves vs. ogres.  It’s less threatening to let the boundaries of Good vs. Evil define our conception of race, since it doesn’t make us really anti-racial, only anti-Evil or anti-Good.

"<u>race,</u><br>
a biological grouping within the human species possessing genetically transmitted traits that are sufficient to characterize it as a distinct human type."
<br><br>
Are elves, dwarves, halflings, orcs etc. separate RACES or separate SPECIES?  Most fantasy histories posit a racial history different from each other race.  Elves were first, then dwarves, then orcs made in a mockery of elves, then humans is a typical historical arrangement.  In no part of these histories does it say that these species are descended from another. (I’ll get to the relationship of Drow to regular Elves, Erudites to Barbarians and humans in Part II)  They all share "humanoid" characteristics, but there is no indication that they are the same species.

Between separate species there is often competition, and this is where the fantasy racial dislike really finds its definition.  Like competing teams on a football field, elves and orcs compete for the same resources, the forests of Norrath.  Orcs and dwarves competed for the underground (I’ll leave the rest of the comparisons for the reader to make).  Repeated wars, defeats, victories and outright theft of these resources has resulted in a fierce rivalry.  Since the stakes are higher than a mere "game", the competition has result in deaths of entire clans or tribes.  Little wonder that there is such hatred between these species.  Individuals participating in these competitive feuds have a real and abiding hatred for those who killed their families or stole their land.  They also don’t see the other species as having a kinship to them.  They are not "brothers under the skin".  They are the jackals to the lions, the foxes to the hens.
