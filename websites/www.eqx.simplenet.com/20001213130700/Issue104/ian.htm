Anticipating writing this "Best of EQX" article I thought back over the history of EverQuest Express and EverQuest itself. I thought of how the community has grown and changed, of the various fan web sites that started and disappeared, and of the legends I have come to meet in this online world. During this break I tried to remember what it was like before stat modifications, weapon efficiency ratios or class balance petitions. My fondest memories of EverQuest came before any of these were issues on anyone's mind outside Sony Interactive Studios' designers.
<br><br>
	When the newsgroups and chat-rooms of Ultima turned their attention to this new online game and the EverQuest community was born, clever conversation and a good tale was as good as it got. I guess I am a sucker for "the good old days", because those are the moments I cherish most. The birth of EQX came with the meeting of many talented individuals who shared with me a common love; role-playing games. Many of them are still here writing for EQX and playing EverQuest today. 
<br><br>
	Since then I've spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to rediscover my ability to role-play while in-game. Hungry for good role-playing material I gobbled up every bit of lore and myth to assimilate into my role somehow, and eventually defeated my own purpose by failing to leave room for the unknown. I credit this fault to my lengthy stay as a PnP Game Master before I knew the online world. However I could not help myself, and defeated what myth could be found in Norrath as quickly as my fingers could find it. 
<br><br>
 Perhaps then it is this yearning for good role playing that leads me to choose my favorite submission to EQX; Oghma's "<a href="../Issue76/random.htm">Random Act's of Role Playing</a>" from issue #76. This particular meld of tale and article was not so much informative as simply entertaining, yet still both to me. He describes how it is often not "acts freighted with Destiny and Fell Swordsmen" that build a character, but the little acts and details that can be more profound.  This here put the "act" in "char<b>act</b>er" for me, and Oghma has a talent all of his own in retelling the incident. 
<br><br>
	While I have yet to bring this level of a role into my gameplay, my favorite submission of my own was drawn from one of my own characters I have tried to breath life into. "<a href="../Issue98/costume.htm">The Costume</a>" from the recent issue #98 was somewhat of a short biography for the character. In it I summed up her strange mannerisms and aloof behavior in a mix of real events and emotions. What I liked most of all might have only been the fun I had writing it, as opposed to the actual quality of the story.
<br><br>
	Choosing a favorite article and story of my own, as well as describing the best moment for EverQuest Express was incredibly difficult. It was by nature that the work here in EQX would grow from talented stories and articles to deeper yet more casual expressions of the authors themselves. (What's in a name, anyhow?)  I love our submitted artwork and look forward to it always, and could never choose a best. Our fictional works add to the myth and magic of this High Fantasy world each in their own way. I look forward to reading the articles as it is sometimes like glimpsing into the next chapter of the author's life.

I love what we do here. My hat's off guys and girls, it's issue One Hundred and Four.  Happy Anniversary Absor and crew.
