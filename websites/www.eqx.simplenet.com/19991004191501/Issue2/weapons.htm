    width="33%"><font face="Arial" size="3">Recently in the News Group two popular issues have
    popped up, aside from flames: Weapons and Riding Creatures. We can agree on one thing it
    seems, and that is the fact &quot;It's too soon to say for sure&quot;. </font><p><font
    face="Arial" size="3">On the topic of weapons we have discussed the amount of training it
    takes to become potent in a weapon and how useful that weapon is in certain situations. It
    started with pikes and polearms, which were agreed to be weapons used against mounted
    troops and not very good weapons in a melee fight. Polearms, like the halberd, are useful
    for about one strike or less before the opponent closes within (under) the range of the
    sharp end.&nbsp;&nbsp; At&nbsp; &nbsp;that &nbsp;&nbsp; point &nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <td valign="top" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px"
    width="33%"><font face="Arial" size="3">weapon could be used for combat. It could be as
    simple as not putting polearms in the game, but what about mounted combat?</font><p><font
    size="3" face="Arial"><font face="Arial">If there are horses in the game and assuming that
    riding the horse gives </font><i>any</i> combat bonus at all the polearm becomes a viable
    weapon for defence against mounted charges. A long spear would do horrendous damage to the
    attacker, as well any polearm. Mounted soldiers vs foot soldiers has historically been
    about what weapons who was using. The same could apply to magical mounts, like Unicorns,
    Pegasi, Nightmares, Wolves, Griffins, Dragons, etc. I tell you I would rather fight a
    charging dragon with a real long sharp spear than a sword &nbsp;unless&nbsp;
    he&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; already </font></td>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Also in the same discussions is the issue of training. Should a non-warrior be
    able to learn a weapon skill? A few weeks training in a pike or polearm is about all you
    would need to use it, since there is no great mastery to poking someone with it.
    Historically polearms were used by the non-combat troops like farmers and children to kill
    as many mounted enemies as possible when charged. The conventional weapons are a different
    story. While two weeks of training in a sword is far better than none, it takes many years
    to become a warrior like out of classic role playing games.<br>
