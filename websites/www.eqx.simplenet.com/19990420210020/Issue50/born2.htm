<b>Chapter 2: A loving family, part 1</b>
<br><br>


Inariis fumed. Her eyes burned a blood red as she stormed from the council chamber. As soon as she felt she was far enough away from the chamber she spit out the necessary arcane syllables and disappeared in a small explosion of eldritch energy to appear again in her inner sanctum in a rush of displaced air. The residual energy sparkled and crawled over the cold, stone floor, seemingly with a life of its own. She was so furious that she didn't even do the small ritual to check for intrusions. Rage filled her mind almost to the brink of making her loose control. 'How dare they!  How could they even presume to order her? To defy her will regarding her sons?'  She howled in the confines of her mind, but only a low, predatory growl escaped her lips. She walked over to where the great, black, snake-adorned mirror hung on the wall, carefully pressing her forehead to its cool, inky surface. As she felt the familiar strands of magic within the otherworldly material respond to her touch, the turmoil inside her slowly began to calm. 
<br><br>
Her twin sons had successfully performed Siin'ruk dok Nuiir just eight days past and today the council of elders had met for the last time to decide upon the future of the brothers. Her own opinion had been to place the boys with private tutors from the Hanathrae clan. Not only would that have strengthened the bonds she had been cultivating with the Hanathrae, a clan high in the city's hierarchy, but it would also have put the twins in a more or less safe place. She would probably even have been able to give them a few lessons herself and make sure the magical defences around them were intact. Now, well, the situation had turned in an, to say the least, unexpected direction. 
<br><br>
To Inariis's great surprise her younger sister Vanriis had stepped forward to eloquently argue the question. She had emphasised the apparently strong gift for magic the twins had and how it would be a shame in the face of Innoruk not to give them the best teaching available. Due to the canon and constraints of tradition they could not study under Inariis's care, the one who would obviously be the most accomplished to teach them, they had to be place with a school that could at least get close to the same quality teaching. And it was now that the real shock came as Vanriis suggested the Zarrinistra Academy, named after it's former master mage and founder and also the place where Inariis herself had studied the arts of magic. Studied the arts and murdered her teacher to steal among other things her magical mirror. A fact not known, but suspected, by many and something which had increased her prestige even more. By now a new master mage had been chosen and to avoid too much rivalry a skilled enchanter from an outlying Teir'Dal community had been elected for the position. His right hand though was the main reason why Inariis didn't put her sons there for any reason. It was the same man that had been her main competitor during her time with the deceased master, Zarrinistra's other pupil, Angithrar of the Faere clan. As far as she knew he still hadn't forgiven her for beating him to the kill. But she had been more or less helpless as the discussion drew to a close. How could she have argued against the twins getting the best education available, something that without doubt was in the best interest of both Innoruk and the clan? She couldn't really admit to have murdered Zarrinistra all those years past, now could she? And showing more brilliance than anyone had ever suspected Vanriis had swayed the others to her cause, except for Darllenan and Aunrar. The twins would go to the Academy to learn how to spin the weave of magic.
<br><br>
Pacing around in her sanctum, fingering some of the many strange and bizarre objects scattered over bookshelves and tables, Inariis pondered what had actually happened during the council. The only one she had expected to openly oppose her had been Derlan and she had been prepared for that eventuality. She had made sure, through both threats and promises that neither Darllenan nor Aunrar, nor Ilithra would support him in any way. In actuality only Ilithra had required heavy coercing, but the promise of a small cache of high-elven jewellery and the threat of exposing a few piquant details about her love life had been enough. Sadly Inariis hadn't exacted any promises regarding Vanriis and she cursed herself for being so blind! "Maybe I'm getting to be old and soft," she thought to herself. "But then… no one would have accused the honoured and feared Faeltana of being soft! No one would have accused Mother of anything and lived to regret it!" She continued to muse over her past as she prepared to call Aunrar and Darllenan to a small meeting.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
Vanriis had walked slowly from the council chamber, taking a roundabout route to her private quarters and keeping her eyes and ears fully focused on her surroundings. You could never be too careful when it came to her hated sister. Still, she couldn't help herself when she remembered Inariis's face at the moment of the council's decision, and a gloating laugh emanated from her fleshy lips. Finally! She had waited for half a century to avenge herself. At last her chance had come and she had executed her plan to perfection. The two female guards that stood beside the stout oaken door that led to her chambers opened the door and stood aside as she approached. With just a whisper of a sound the door was closed behind her. Well inside, she laughed long and hard. But it was not a laugh of happiness; instead it was filled with utter malice.
<br><br>
When the Testing had been disturbed by some magic from the outside she had watched with horror-filled fascination. She had wanted both twins to be torn limb from limb, but she had also been terribly frustrated that it wasn't she who had instigated it all, but it had all worked out for the best. The twins had by some means managed to survive that trial; the next one wouldn't be that easy at all! "Hmmm… hopefully they will still be alive when it's all over. Alive, but ravingly mad and forever ripped from the magical weave!" she whispered to herself as she moved toward a small, stone cabinet, intricately carved with a multitude of screaming demons, by the far wall. She bent down, gently touching the head of a demon in the bottom corner, and the top of the cabinet slid open with a faint hiss, somehow disappearing into the thin walls of the cabinet. Carefully she reached into the opening and retrieved a black, rectangular box, a foot long on each side. Bringing it with her, she crossed the floor and entered the vaulted opening to a back room, her own little laboratory. The emerald green drapes that hung all the way to the grey, stone floor fluttered to the side as with a life of their own and closed again as soon as she had passed.
<br><br>
The room was rather sparsely furnished when one considered its size. It was twenty feet at the wall where she had entered and stretched some forty feet toward the keeps outer wall. There a window, covered in dark crystal, broke an in other regards completely blank stretch of stone. On the other walls several tapestries hung, depicting the glorious victories of the Teir'Dal over the other, lesser, races that made Underfoot their home. One tapestry in particular would catch a visitor's eye, not that she would allow many to set foot in the chamber. It showed a spectacular view of an underground lake with cave walls that glimmered with crystal and precious metal and cast dazzling reflections in the dark waters. The weave was so intricate that if you looked closely enough one could almost see the ripples moving over the lake's surface, caused by some unknown current. And you would have to try and convince yourself that the sound of splashing water was nothing more than your imagination. The only real furniture in the room was a large, iron chest, which reached almost to Vanriis' shin, by the right wall and a low, round, ebony table in the middle of the room.
<br><br>
She walked to the table and sat down cross-legged on the floor, facing the tapestry of the lake. Carefully she put the box on the hard surface. They both had the exact same colour and almost looked as if they had been seamlessly joined. She let her fingers softly caress the sides of the box while her memory leaped back to that hateful time almost fifty years ago.
<br><br>
It had been during the aftermath of the last war with dwarves. The short folk had launched a campaign against the citizens of Neriak but had been beaten and forced to flee back to their homeland. The price paid by the Teir'Dal had been high though and many prominent warriors, clerics and magic-users had gone to stand at Innoruk's side. Among them the Vandre'Tarl progenitors, Faeltana and Arllenan. They had died as they led the clan's troops in pursuit of a fleeing contingent of dwarves, only to be caught in a cowardly ambush. The battle had been short but fierce and when the dwarves that had been hunted turned back to join their brethren the outcome had been sealed. Summoning their last strength and helped by powerful elementals the Teir'Dal had managed to break free. The magicians of the troop had summoned great walls of flame and stone to cover the retreat and succeeded in holding off the dwarves long enough for reinforcements from other clans to reach them and bolster their forces. Then the balance of the battled shifted once more in favour of the dark elves. Faeltana and Arllenan had not been among those that had escaped the dwarves' trap.
<br><br>
The clan's exploits during the short but intense war had highly strengthened their position in the city hierarchy, but the loss of the two cardinal members had thrown the clan itself into chaos. The eight siblings had been constantly plotting with and against each other in their vying for power. No one dared to falter, fearing it would allow one of the others to climb to supremacy. 
<br><br>
Vanriis though, had tried to stay out of the infighting as much as possible. Being the youngest, she knew that her hopes for a position of influence were low, much better for her to find and nurture bonds within other clans and by that build up a solid base for future ambitions. By chance she had been able to fight beside a handsome, young male when the dwarves had almost reached the very gates of Neriak. They had fought back to back, he with a glowing sabre that cut the bearded ones with both steel and fire and she with the terrible spells granted her by Innoruk himself. When the attack had been turned into a rout they had managed to steal a couple of moments of rest. They stood in the flickering light of a burning building, drenched in blood and gore and with the sweet smell of fire and death in their nostrils. Something unusual for the Teir'Dal had flashed between them, a feeling of understanding and fellowship, and in a quick embrace they shared a passionate kiss, tinged with the blood of their fallen enemies. In parting they exchanged vows to meet again.
<br><br>
When things had settled down Vanriis had made inquiries about the male's identity, both through mundane means and through her clerical spells. Soon enough she had found him. His name was Haelvin Faere, and he was the eldest son and the highest ranked warrior of the Faere clan, a fine catch indeed! She sent a minor spirit carrying a message proposing a meeting and it wasn't long until she received a reply suggesting a small inn on the outskirts of town, often used by Teir'Dal wanting to meet liaisons incognito. Of course she accepted and they agreed to have their rendezvous in three days time.
<br><br>
When the time was neigh she had left the Vandre'Tarl compound, dressed in a plain black cloak with a deep hood, only bringing two of her most trusted female bodyguards. They had travelled the smaller alleys and kept away from watching eyes as much as possible and without incident they had reached the inn in question, "Innoruk's Charm", a rather luxurious affair with four stories and many rooms of various styles. Only the wealthy could afford a night here. You didn't just pay for splendour and elegance, you paid for anonymity as well and that commodity didn't come cheap in the Teir'Dal capital, were spying eyes existed in abundance. Once there, Vanriis ascended the stairs leading to the room she rented under an assumed name, and for the second time in her life, came face to face with Haelvin. He was waiting for her as she entered and dressed in a splendid crimson outfit, cut low over his breast according to the latest fashion, he made a very striking figure. They didn't utter a word, but fell in each other's arms. The hours that followed still, even nearly fifty years later, made Vanriis body hot as she thought about them. 
<br><br>
During the following weeks they met several times, always taking the utmost care to hide the affair from prying eyes. Their families were rivals after all and the right political manipulations had to be made before they could present their relationship to their respective clans. If handled correctly it could all be used to create an official alliance between the two, something that would improve Vanriis's position immensely. Not only would she become a person of importance among the Vandre'Tarl, she would get to spend time with a male she had a great affection and passion for! It couldn't get much better. It really looked as if fate had given her a bright future! Then, naturally, it all fell apart around her. Her hopes and dreams slipped through her fingers like fleeting sand.
<br><br>
It had been a couple of days since her last meeting with Haelvin. She was in a good mood when one of the clan's guards came running up to her as she was on her way to her quarters. "Please, miss, your honoured siblings require your presence in the council chamber," he said reverently. "I will escort you there immediately, if you don't mind?" She nodded and gestured for him to lead the way. As they hurriedly descended into the lower levels of the keep an ominous feeling settled over her, something was terribly wrong. 
<br><br>
In the council chamber her brothers and sisters were all gathered. Apparently they all had got there in a hurry as both Darllenan and Nebelyn were still in their battle armour while Aunrar's clothes looked like he had been in a failed magical experiment. Judging by the scowl that he wore it was more likely that the interruption had caused the failure. The others, especially Inariis, seemed to have had some more time to collect themselves. Someone was missing though. Vanriis looked around. "And where is our dear, sadistic brother Urllen?" she asked, with more than a little contempt in her voice. Inariis stepped forward to answer, a smug smile on her lips, and once again that dark feeling sent shivers up Vanriis's spine.
<br><br>
"We will join our brother shortly," Inariis said, still smiling. "He is preparing a surprise for the family and it wouldn't do to get there early, would it?" It was apparent from the tone of her voice that something had happened that would favour the clan or, more probably, herself. For a short while Inariis stood still as if she listened to something the others couldn't hear. "Ah, yes, it's time! Let me show you what wonderful gift blessed Innoruk has bestowed upon us!" and with those triumphant words she started to weave a magical spell, her hands and fingers flickering through the air as she gathered glowing strands of power. With a sharp word of command she finished her creation and a shimmering gate opened in the air before her. "Don't be shy," she said with a flourishing gesture. "Step right in and let's see what Urllen has prepared for us!" One by one they walked into the gate, which bulged and rippled as if made by water, and with a quick look behind her at her sister, Vanriis too crossed through and Inariis followed soon after.
<br><br>
What happened next was what pained Vanriis most to remember and as the images flickered through her mind her anger and hate were fanned anew into white-hot flames. As they stepped through the gate they all emerged into one of the small cells in the deepest dungeons of the keep. The cell lacked all the mundane means of entrance and no prisoner had, for obvious reasons, ever managed to escape. Now it was the workspace for Urllen. A wooden table was covered with different instruments of torture, wicked looking knives and sickles, tubes and spikes. Urllen himself had designed many, his hand and cruel imagination most assuredly guided by Innoruk or one of his minions. Beside the table the traditional brazier stood, its glowing coals casting a menacing red light. The handles of several implements could be seen sticking up from its hot embrace. On the rough wall close by a shape hung limply, chained by its wrists to the wall and its ebony skin marred with the telltale marks of their brother's work. Urllen, only wearing a thin black hose, looked up from his place facing the prisoner as they entered, a bloodied blade in his hand. "Oh, you're here", he said, wiping the sweat from his brow. "I'm sorry to say that haven't managed to get this son-of-a-goblin to speak. I must say that he has a remarkable resistance to pain, but it's only a matter of time, they all talk sooner or later," he finished with a grim but appreciative smile. 
<br><br>
Looking at the shape on the wall Vanriis had felt a heavy weight settle on her shoulders. It couldn't be! It mustn't be! But her worst fears were confirmed when Inariis stepped up to the prisoner and with a snarl lifted his chin to look into his face, and the weak light fell upon the once beautiful and handsome features of Haelvin Faere, now broken and scarred at the skilful hands of Urllen. "So, what's a Faere scum going to tell us tonight, hmmm?" Inariis snarled, but Haelvin didn't stir. His breathing was so shallow that you could barely see his breast move. Turning back to her gathered siblings she said, "We managed to capture him only two days ago as he was returning home from some secretive meeting in the city," at this Vanriis barely managed to suppress a gasp. "He had only brought four guards, the stupid boy, so it posed no problem whatsoever. We caught him just as easily as the giant spiders can catch an unwary goblin whelp," she continued, now with a triumphant note in her voice. "At last we have the opportunity to find out the innermost secrets of clan Faere! At last we have got that weapon we need to bring them to heel!" At this the gathering nodded and mumbled their agreements. Even Vanriis managed to squeeze out a few positive words, accompanied by the most evil smile she managed to put forth.
<br><br>
"As always, you have done the clan a great good!" Darllenan said with his deep voice and bowed slightly to his sister, pressing a light kiss on one of her hands. "Surely you walk in the grace of mighty Innoruk!"
<br><br>
"Yes, you are truly a worthy member of the Teir'Dal," Aunrar filled in and gave a small acknowledging nod and a smile. His green eyes though remained as cold as the icy wastes of the barbarian homelands. They almost appeared to sparkle with an inner light as they studied the proceedings in the room. "But let's get this over with," he continued. " I still have an important experiment to finish and I wouldn't dare to think what would happen if I left it alone for too long. Why, we might even find ourselves on the surface after an explosion like that!"
<br><br>
Inariis nodded, somewhat annoyed at the disrespectful tone of the other magic user, and once again turned to face their prisoner. "So you don't want to speak, eh?" she purred dangerously and let her nails trail over Haelvin's abdomen, drawing patterns with the slowly drying blood but still not getting any reaction. "We'll see how long you can withstand my arts!" and taking a couple of steps backwards she began a guttural incantation. As she intoned syllables that didn't sound like anything supposed to be uttered by a mortal tongue, white and blue energy started to flicker and dance at her fingertips like tiny lightning bolts, snaking their way up her forearms. Within a minute she had gathered enough energy that the light from her hands and arms cast the room into stark contrast. The air was filled with an acrid smell that stung the eyes and throats of the others, who like one being backed as far away from Inariis as was possible. The spell completed, she began to swing her arms, like she was holding a whip with both her hands, and the magic she had spun crackled in the air and swung with her. After a few moments it looked to the spectators like she was indeed holding a whip, a whip made of lightning.
<br><br>
With a maniacal laughter bubbling from her lips, Inariis dealt ravaging pain to Haelvin's trapped form and as the magical whip made contact with his skin for the first time, he raised his head and his face contorted with anguish. He still didn't utter a single sound, even though blood poured freely over his body and every fibre in his body twitched and burned from the torture he suffered. His blue eyes, still clear, fastened upon Vanriis, neither condemning nor angry, just incredibly sad. She felt his gaze bore into her soul and the pain his body felt, she felt in her heart. Every single lash from the whip destroyed her a little bit more.
<br><br>
As they watched, Inariis used the whip to strip the skin from the prisoner's body, moments later he was not much more than a blood-dripping piece of meat hanging from the wall, but he wouldn't cry out and his eyes still shone with defiance at his tormentor. Inariis had long since stopped laughing and by now she was trembling with rage, the insolence! "Vanriis!" she shouted. "Use your clerical skills to heal this heap of offal, so we can begin this game anew!"
<br><br>
She couldn't do that, not to him. "I'm sorry, dear sister," she said, desperately trying to keep the trembling out of her voice. "I have not prayed for any healing spells today. If I had but known…" She let the sentence drift away as Inariis screamed with rage.
<br><br>
"You defy me! You dare!" she screamed. "Let's see how well you defy Innoruk himself!" and as if in slow motion, Vanriis watched her sister plunge the lightning-whip into Haelvin's heart. His body went into a final spasm, his eyes wide open, and then he hung limp once more.
<br><br>
Vanriis almost crushed the box as those last images imprinted themselves upon her mind. "Inariis will pay! Oh, how she will pay!" she whispered to herself, voice dripping with venom. "Her two brats are only the beginning, then I'll take care of the cursed demoness herself! I can't believe how the others let her become our informal leader, didn't we agree upon us forming a joint council? Well, it will all change!" Carefully she opened the black box and removed its contents, a round, perfectly smooth, green crystal, and placed it in a shallow indentation in the table before her. She ran her hands over the crystal and tiny glowing runes appeared all over its surface. Slowly a swirling, white mist started to form in its centre.  "Let's see what Angithrar has to say about his new students… Maybe he'll want to give them a little surprise! He seemed so happy about my suggestion of sending them to him!"
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
Aunrar was in the Chamber of Learning when the messenger arrived. It was a small, almost invisible elemental creature from the Plane of Air and it looked like a small, transparent cloud, which might have had the features of a fairy. He probably wouldn't have seen it at all if it hadn't been for the spells he surrounded himself with and his wards gave their familiar warnings long before the creature was in his immediate vicinity. He pointedly closed the scroll he had been studying and with a deft movement slipped it inside his purple robe. It wouldn't do to let Inariis in on his secrets and he doubted that it could be anyone else that had sent the messenger.
<br><br>
"Do your bidding and be gone," Aunrar said, irritated by the interruption to his research.
<br><br>
The creature flew nearer and started to speak in a high-pitched, whistling voice. "Inariis Vandre'tarl, my mighty mistress, begs you to attend her in her private chambers," it said. "I am to let you know that it is of utmost importance that you come and that you come quickly. Do not keep my mistress waiting or your punishment will be severe!" and with that the creature quickly flew away, leaving an exasperated Aunrar in the Chamber of Learning.
<br><br>
He sighed. "What is she up to now?" he thought, but he already had a rather good idea of that. Only a short time had passed since the council had gone against Inariis's wishes regarding her sons and considering where they would be sent, he could very well understand why she had to do something fast. He had a reasonable idea of what had instigated the demise of Inariis's old teacher and to put the twins in the hand of that teachers other main student and Inariis's primary rival… Well, it could only spell doom for the two little boys and that would be such a waste of talent. Above all, it would hinder the greater plan that both he and the twins were a part of and that would be great loss for the cause of knowledge.
<br><br>
Once again he sighed. It wasn't easy being and living as a Teir'Dal while you for all you tried couldn't sympathise with the main tenet of all their philosophy. "Why?" Aunrar thought. "Why can't a race that has such longevity and such inherent skill for the arts of knowledge not manage to break free from a doctrine of hate that obviously hinders their future progress?" He just couldn't understand it. Of course he was convinced of Teir'Dal superiority in relation to the other races, it was obvious to any observer, but he couldn't accept the plain stupidity by which they refused to acknowledge ideas from the other races. Sure, if it was a matter of destruction, then his brethren might take impression. A new engine of war would cause them to react, as would any new spell of mass destruction, or a newly developed insidious poison. Never though, in a subject concerning pure knowledge and that could be given an immediate calamitous use. They just didn't understand that all knowledge was valuable and could be used to further the cause of the race itself. You never knew the importance of a single piece of the puzzle until you got to see the entire picture. His brethren were usually more interested in taking the picture apart than they were looking at it. 
<br><br>
Well, it didn't matter. As long as a few souls might be impressed to walk the path to knowledge he would've accomplished something with his life. "Although that life might be short indeed, if anyone finds out what I have done," he thought grimly as he stood and started for the door. "I don't think that the clerics and priests of Innoruk would appreciate my creating a shrine in honour of another god."
<br><br>
When he reached the door he halted and shrugged. Why should he use mundane means? But, then, why not? For a change he decided to walk to Inariis's chambers at the top of the keep. It was some time since he last was away on one of his ventures and by now he sorely needed the exercise and besides, he needed the time to collect his thoughts.
<br><br>
He walked slowly up the winding stairs. He took his time, Inariis would just have to wait and he knew that they were too evenly matched for her to cause too much of a fuss. He let his mind wander and thought about how he would handle the upcoming situation, but as always he kept a part of his mind alert for danger. Although most problems would be taken care of by the many spells that were active around him, you could never be too careful. This was Neriak after all, and above all, this was where his family was. He smiled grimly at the thought.
<br><br>
What should he do? For the sake of the twins he had promised Inariis his support regarding the twins' future, but what was he to do when Vanriis had put things forth the way she did? Well, nothing to do about that now, they would just have to think about a way to keep the twins protected while they were away. Inariis to further her own agenda and himself to further the cause of knowledge, or at least that was the way he liked to view it. He thought back on the time just before the birth of the two brothers. 
<br><br>
He had been getting his visions almost on a regular basis. If he slept, he would hear the voice and see that tranquil face, if he was awake, his studies would inexorably lead him to some obscure pages regarding surface religion and philosophy. He had several decades earlier turned his faith away from Innoruk and instead directed his few prayers to a god whose creed at least more resembled his own, but Quellious had never imposed on his life such as happened now. The god wanted him to prepare the way, to help him open the eyes of the blind to the ever-shining light of knowledge. He wanted an anchor in the centre of Neriak, a place from which his faith may spread. He wanted Aunrar to create a shrine in his name. The mere thought of that had made Aunrar cringe. Building a shrine to another god than Innoruk? In Neriak? It was impossible! The clerics would surely notice and the torment he would suffer under their supervision… He could barely imagine it, and his imagination was extremely vivid!
<br><br>
In the end he hadn't had much of a choice in the matter. Aunrar had been chosen to perform a mission for Quellious and the god wouldn't be denied. If Aunrar wanted to be able to concentrate on his research again he would either have to renounce his faith, which meant admitting to leaving the fold of Innoruk in the first place, not a feasible option, and which would hamper his studies immeasurably, or do as the god commanded. The choice was rather obvious. It might risk his life, but hadn't his studies of the magical arts done that throughout his entire life? He would just have to put his mind to the matter and try to figure out a, preferably, safe way to go about it. 
<br><br>
And so he secluded himself in the Chamber of Learning. The hours he didn't spend there, he spent ploughing through his own, rather extensive, personal library. Days went by, then weeks, but at least the visions didn't haunt him while he was getting forward in the research. Then, one day, he found the answer and to his great surprise it was in a tome on Teir'Dal warfare written by a prominent war-wizard. Naturally the answer was so simple that it had been right under his nose all the time. It was just a matter of camouflage, to hide the shrine in a place where no one would look for it, a place that was screened from most magic anyhow. He slapped his forehead and laughed aloud when he figured it out. Of course! He looked around on the book and scroll covered walls in the Chamber of Learning. What better place to be dedicated to the god of knowledge than a room full of just that: knowledge? And the chamber was protected from most hostile forms of magic as from many types of scrying. It would do splendidly! Now it was only the small matter of making the place into a shrine.
<br><br>
Once again he returned to his books, but this time the answer was much faster in finding. Soon he had created a ritual for the purpose at hand, created from a combination of spells gleaned from different tomes. It incorporated two things. The first a powerful enchantment of dowsing that would attach to the already existent protective barrier of the chamber, but that was constructed to further hide the new active energies from probing minds. Only the most talented magic user would even notice that something was amiss, let alone be able to see what. The second part was much harder and infinitely much more dangerous. What he had to do, essentially, was to make the chamber into a channel that led power to and from Quellious domain. To prevent as much "seepage" as possible, Aunrar had to shift the entire room a bit closer to the god's plane of existence. He accomplished this through a complex variation of a gate spell. The result was that when you stepped into the chamber, you'd actually take a tiny step through the dimensions too, but it also made it almost impossible to magically scry the area. Not many magic-users expected, or were able to for that matter, to send their probing minds through more than one plane of reality. He was quite satisfied with his work. It wasn't a sacred place in the traditional sense of the word, but it would serve the same purpose while being hidden in plain sight of his siblings and other Teir'Dal, not a mean feat at all!
<br><br>
Almost at the top of the keep Aunrar mused at his own ingenuity and it certainly had worked out for the best. The twins had through almost all of their basic studies spent their time in the Chamber of Learning and through this unwittingly absorbed some of Quellious essence. They might have the morals of the Teir'Dal, but their hearts and souls would ultimately belong to the cause of knowledge.
