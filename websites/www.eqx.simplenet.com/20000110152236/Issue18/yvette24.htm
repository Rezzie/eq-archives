"Sure, yes. I was just thinking again." Yvette turned away from the ocean and looked
at the coastline ahead. Already you could make out the gentle glow of the Qeynos
walls in the setting sun. The sailors became a lively bunch, anticipating the night
of frolic in the taverns at shore ahead. There was much singing and drinking as they
made early preparations to land. Such was not the case on the other ship, however.

Almost forgotten by the Erudite passengers, the second ship was a warrior's charter,
more of a war ship than a cargo ship like this one. It had spent much of the journey
at a peaceful distance away from them but as they came within a half hour of the
shore it was closer, and one could now see flickering light from a fire beneath the
deck. Men came rushing up from below engulfed in oil based fire, diving to their
deaths in the freezing ocean waters.

Spine chilling screams called for help of the cargo ship, and the crew turned to pull
the people out of the water and away from the burning ship. By the time they were
half way turned around the whole ship was aflame, and the women stood in awe of the
helpless men in the water. Marissa looked as if she was going to be sick. Montgomery
came to stand by them as they watched the sailors pull the dead and wounded out of
the water. The smoking hull of the other ship sunk into the water in a mist, taking
the warriors treasure with it.
