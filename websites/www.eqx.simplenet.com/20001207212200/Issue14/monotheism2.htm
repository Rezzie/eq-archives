Let’s look at our buddy Rallos. "His world is a scene of constant strife and battle" - this points to chaos as a world view axis, and indeed, war itself is chaotic.  There may be some that say armies require order to function correctly, but perhaps that would be another aspect of war, and not the war described by our picture of Rallos’.  "Corpses littering the ground" and "..air dark and filled with smoke" give a clear picture of turbulence and unrest.
<br><br>
Along the good/evil axis, we have to rule out good right away.  If there is a good aspect of war, Rallos certainly doesn’t represent it.  Rallos Zek could be neutral, but the black skin (a common symbol of evil) and the red lava veins don’t give that impression, especially when added to the description of his world and how he rules it with an "iron fist".  So we’ll put Rallos Zek into the category of Chaotic Evil.

How do you worship such a deity? There are different levels of worship to consider, and different methods of worship.   Are you a lay worshipper, or a cleric of the god?  Do you just want to generally worship all the gods in the pantheon?  Is Rallos Zek a god you want paying attention to you, or do you want him to ignore you because you give him nice gifts?
<br><br>
A lay worshipper is your typical church-goer, observing the rituals and perhaps tithing to the church, but not really "into" it.  This is usually what non-clerical classes do.  A lay worshipper does hold the world view of the deity, but not in any fanatical sense.  
<br><br>
A cleric would promote the gods interests, actively trying to cause chaos and war, so his deity would be satisfied.  The cleric would not do it through underhanded means usually, since Rallos seems very straightforward, but could possibly cause strife between groups by careful misrepresentation.  (For example, lying to one group about what another group is, or said about them).  The cleric would gain prestige in the clergy for causing war, and would actively try to gain Rallos’ attention.

Most people wouldn’t actively worship Rallos, they would try to placate him.  This is a deity you don’t want actively interested in you, because of his chaotic nature.  Asking him for help is possibly bringing in ruin for both your enemies and yourself.  You might make an offering to placate him before negotiations, or you might, in the heat of battle, try to ward him off.  Those who love the chaos and fear caused during a battle would probably scream his name, however.
<b><b></b></b>
Any deity description gives clues to their behavior and therefore, the behavior of their worshippers.  It is up to us, as role-players to use that as the basis for role-playing.  Would you run towards or away from a worshipper of Rallos Zek?  Ask your character.
