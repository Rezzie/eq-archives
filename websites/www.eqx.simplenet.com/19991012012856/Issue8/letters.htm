[snipped - long discussion about player killing and the roleplaying thereof...]
<br><br>
On a technical point, the switch is a new approach that is being
attempted in order to solve the problem.  The reason that there is a
problem is that nothing else has worked before and therefore the most
logical course of action is to attempt something new.  Wait for the game
to come out and see how it develops.  Trust the Everquest team.  If they
deliver then
they are great and if they fail and take our money then they can hang with
UO.
<br><br>
In conclusion, Absor, I appreciate the concern you have for
Everquest and it is clear that you of all things want to have a great
MORPG to play in.  However, I read the piece by Brad and I did not have
the same reaction as you did.  Let things develop and grow.  

<p align="right"><em>Letter from Olorim</em></p>
<p><em>[Ed.] Well, Olorim sure can write...  I'm sorry that I had to clip your letter.
I read it all, but it was just too long for this forum.  And I hope that Brad's response
(which was posted to issue 7 after Olorim sent his response) helps to allay your fears as
it did mine.</em></p>

I had the same gut based feeling when I read the article and the
associated quote. I had been looking forward to this game but suddenly
it seems the whole world will be split into two groups, immune chatters
and frenzied quake players.
The last part especially worried me because I read it entirely
differently then Absor. I read it that MOST of the in game opportunities
will only be available to those who have the PvP switch set to ON, thus
making non PvP ers basically chat roomers, while at the same time the
previous quote implies, that there will be few if any consequences for
pkilling. Thus to participate in the quests, you must venture out into a
world with no consequences for killing or murder, faring agaisnt people
who SPECIALIZE in killing people. These pkillers will wait at places
they know questors must go and then will kill them and it is common
knowledge that pkillers have more expertise in killing.
This bodes ill for EQ and I sincerely hope Brad misspoke.

	I like the new sites "front page" much better than the old one. Please
keep the newspaper look when doing any changes in the future. My idea of
"newspaper look" is one that is simple, easy on the eye, and very
accessible. One that looks like it may have been run off an old mechanical
printing press, or at least holds with the philosophy of simplicity and
good taste. I think the new EQX form fits the bill nicely.
<br><br>
	The Everquest title on the old form, the swirly squishy wiggly thingy,
whatever it is called, just does not carry the idea that this is a
newspaper. I guess I am saying it was out of character to use a rpg term.
And the big colorful type that varied in size and font was a bit much too.
I'm glad to see both gone from the new front page. Good job!
<br><br>
	In the forum it was said that this project might be carried over to an
in-game newspaper. I think this is a wonderful Idea and hope to see it
done.

PS    I can't get the wyvern.gif to load. Everything else works fine. I use
IE 3.02
<br><br>
<em>[Ed.] Thanks for the praise!  And thanks to the others that wrote with
similar compliments.  I am glad that the newspaper theme was recognized, that's
what we were looking for.  And I am sorry about the pictures not loading (there were
more than just the wyvern).  I copied an error throughout the pages.</em>
<br><br>
<em>Because this is really the first issue for letters to the editor, will have another
<a href="letters2.htm" target>page</a> of them.</em>
