	<em>"I give my last breaths to you, Edril."
<br><br>
	"Don't talk that way, sir, you still have many years left."
<br><br>
	"Thank you for humoring an old man.  But you and I both know that's not true.  My time is fast approaching, the new king will take the throne of Felwithe, and both of us will be forgotten.  It is inevitable."
<br><br>
	"How could anyone forget you, sir?"
<br><br>
	"The winds of time, my warrior.  The winds of time can carry any man's name to oblivion.  But you still have a chance.  Leave this place, leave these hollow halls and the glittering pillars of the castle behind you.  Leave for Antonica and never look back.  I don't want you to die with me."
<br><br>
	"Sir…what…"
<br><br>
	"If you stay, my warrior, you will be forgotten as well.  Your future lies elsewhere in Norrath.  You have the blood of a hero, so much like your father, but something else.  There is a killer in you, and it's tearing your soul apart.  I've seen it in your face.  Your hands are stained with the blood of countless enemies, and yet you feel the urge to find more.  I've always thought of you as a son, Edril, and it pains me: this great conquest of yours.  I hope one day you find what it is you're searching for.  But Edril…Edril…it cannot be found…in death…"
<br><br>
	"Emperor!  Carandril!  Open your eyes…"
<br><br>
	"Live, Edril…live your legend…live…forever…"</em>
<br><br>
	The elf woke in a dark room and on a strange bed covered in thick blankets of wool.  What time of day it was he couldn't tell, as the large windows on either side of his room were all covered by red silk drapes.  Edril wondered for a second what had awakened him until a loud pounding resonated from outside.  Someone was knocking on his door.  "I'm coming," he called to the room's entrance before swinging his legs around to the bed's edge and shakily standing up.  The elf blinked once, ridding himself of the languid confusion that only comes from a restless sleep, before fumbling around a series of oak tables and inlaid shelves to grab a nearby robe.
<br><br>
	It had been a full three days since Edril had returned with the caravan to the commonlands of Freeport.  John had welcomed them back with a warm meal and a large smile, which was customary, but his temperament had grown increasingly somber as the merchant listened to Aryn's information.  John said he would think on the matter, but at present he considered the bandit threat to have ended.  Edril was then given his full payment and the guest house on the western side of the merchant's mansion, a small one room cabin constructed from Kithicor wood and sheltered by the branches of overlaying trees.  It was quiet and private, which suited Edril just fine.
<br><br>
	Fastening a thick, linen strap around his waist to keep the robe closed, the elf slowly made his way to the door and unhooked the lock from it's handle.  A little annoyed at being disturbed from his sleep, Edril opened the door which swung inward with the squeal of a rusty hinge.  Sunlight stung his eyes and forced him to squint before the tall and green skinned form of a troll took shape before him.  The creature's red eyes peered at him from under the hood of a thick robe.
<br><br>
	The elf stumbled back, taking in a sharp breath of air, and his mind reeled from the surprise.  Should he run…should he go for his sword…should he attack the creature with his bare hands?  The troll, with a calm and collected expression of determination, held up one hand in response.  "Please," the troll said in perfect common, "do not be afraid.  I have not come here to harm you."
<br><br>
	Edril's pointed ears twitched, a distinct sign of elven confusion, and he looked on either side of the troll for anyone else who might be there.  It was the middle of the day and shafts of light poured down between the high trees of Kithicor.  "Who…" Edril began, "Who are you?"
<br><br>
	The troll bowed his head and crossed his arms beneath the folds of his long cloak.  "My name is Jalic.  I come representing the wishes of the temple of Cazic-Thule from the kingdom of Grobb, on direct orders from the high priest Kul'ash himself."  
<br><br>
	Edril nodded once and feigned amazement.  "Your…orders being?"
<br><br>
	"To bring you to Grobb."
<br><br>
	"If this concerns the killing of ten trolls in Ro, then I refuse to leave.  They were bandits and operating against trade laws between Grobb and Freeport."
<br><br>
	"Ten dead rebels in the desert do not concern us, elf," the troll snarled slightly as he spat the words, and for the first time Edril saw the disgust in Jalic's eyes the troll was trying desperately to mask.  "This is not about revenge."
<br><br>
	"Then what is it about?"
<br><br>
	"We require your services."
<br><br>
	"My services?"  Edril smiled and forced a laugh.  "Since when do the trolls hire elves."
<br><br>
	Jalic's lips curled over his fangs before he regained his composure.  "The temple requires the services of a warrior familiar with our present crisis.  My lord was under the impression that you are such a warrior.  Now do you accept or not?"
<br><br>
	"Your present crisis?"
<br><br>
	Jalic's face seemed flushed and pale when the elf finished the question, his eyes looking up to the distant sun.  "Our present crisis…the complete destruction of Grobb and it's temples, the separation of the troll race, and an army so savage Antonica will burn before it's last soldier is destroyed.  But nothing more can be said until you speak to the head priest."
<br><br>
	Edril had never seen a troll who could speak common this well and with such an intelligence to back his words.  Greater still was the apprehension he found within himself when he saw fear across Jalic's face.  The young troll was distinctly afraid of something.  "If I refuse?" Edril asked after a moment of hesitation.
<br><br>
	"Don't refuse.  The temple is prepared to pay you large fees in any desired currency.  Plus I am told you are not one to pass up a battle."  The troll dropped his hands to his sides and looked the elf straight in the eye.  "I have already spoken to the barbarian Aryn and to the merchant John.  They both approve.  So what is your answer, Edril?"
<br><br>
	Crossing his arms and breathing a heavy sigh, the elf turned again to the darkness of his temporary room.  In one corner rested his curved blade, sheltered in it's leather scabbard, silent, peaceful.  Edril knew, in that brief and questioning look, that it would be a long time before he returned to his wife in Qeynos.  Even more then the troll's veiled threat, Jalic's fear and his story drove Edril to the inevitable answer.  His soul was pulled once more by the promise of adventure, and struggle, and blood.
<br><br>
	"When do we leave?" he asked in a tired voice.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
	The prophet sat alone and quiet in a circle of flickering candles.  His eyes were closed and his legs were crossed, while from his lips buzzed the soft hum of meditation.  His tent was structured so that it kept all sunlight out and trapped all shadow in, the thick leather flaps which served as a doorway blocking all wind from entering.  A complex string of poles and arches kept the hut from crumbling into the sands.  All that was inside were the troll, his candles, and the place where he sat: a perfect runic circle painted with the blood of other trolls across the prophet's white sand floor.  Here Zisstrik sat in silent contemplation.  Here strange energies pulsed through his body, seeping into his mind with whispered promises of strength and power, until nothing was left of Zisstrik the troll but an empty memory.  He was instead a catalyst of fear, a tool of dark magics and ancient prophecies.
<br><br>
	But where inside the tent the serene metamorphosis of Zisstrik took place, outside the tent a mammoth battle raged.  Across the sands were scattered the dead bodies of numerous trolls, their lifeless eyes held staring at a cloudless sky and their mouths wide in a quiet scream.  In the middle of them all stood the proud beast: a large mound of flesh and muscles and fangs natives referred to only as a sand giant.  He looked around him with eyes covered by his own overhanging brow, saw more advancing soldiers approaching, and howled madly to the sun.  Protruding fangs jutted from every corner of his mouth.
<br><br>
	The three trolls who gathered enough to courage to attack the beast first ran forward with screams of their own and broke their spears on the tough skin of the massive giant.  The beast, laughing inwardly, tore one of the soldiers in half with both arms before pounding the bones of the other two into the dust.  The rest of the soldiers fell back with the giant right behind them.
<br><br>
	A troll clad in dented pieces of haphazard armor threw open the flaps on Zisstrik's tent.  The wind from outside swept sand onto the entrance floor and extinguished the flames on the candles.  The prophet slowly opened his eyes, red from many hours of darkened solitude, and glared at the newcomer with a look of questioning and hatred.
<br><br>
	"<em>U… uramph n..n..neshkim…</em>" the soldier stuttered and lowered his eyes, unable to find the strength to look at Zisstrik's face.  "The giant is closer.  We cannot keep him down.  The men are dying."
<br><br>
	"So deal with it." Zisstrik spoke from behind clenched teeth.
<br><br>
	"We… we cannot.  <em>Hur uzk tar barolk</em>.  The giant is too much for us alone."
<br><br>
	"What kind of fighters are you!?  Your failure displeases Trakanon, and it displeases me!  Go, fight, we shall not mourn the passing of failures."
<br><br>
	"But… but sir, some of the soldiers are stopping.  Some are abandoning camp.  They say…they say…"  the troll soldier sank to his knees and put his head to the floor.  "<em>buz uzk ug bolgim</em>."
<br><br>
	Zisstrik stood, his muscles rigid with anger.  "They say what?" he asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>
	"That you are a coward for staying inside."
<br><br>
	With a low growl Zisstrik, more floating across the ground then walking, made his way past the prostrated soldier and through the flaps on his tent.  Surveying the valley where his camp was built, the prophet smelled the scent of blood in the air and locked eyes with the vicious giant, who was chasing Zisstrik's retreating guards.  The troll's black cloak was caught in the desert winds, and strips of fabric from the clothing flapped in the air around him, cascading down the hillside in beautiful waves of rippling cloth.  He held one outstretched claw to the beast.  "<em>SHAZGOLI!</em>" Zisstrik cried in an amplified voice and the giant turned and grinned.
<br><br>
	It took only four long strides before the giant's shadow covered Zisstrik.  The beast hesitated for only a few seconds, but when he saw the troll do nothing he lifted one arm into the air and brought it down on top of Zisstrik with tremendous force.  The giant's hand, however, hit only an invisible barrier above the troll which shimmered with a flickering intensity when the monster struck it.  Bolt's of lightning flashed from Zisstrik's fingers and danced up the giant's arm and across his chest.  The creature screamed, forcing all the soldiers to cover their ears, and reeled back.  When the giant lashed out a second time his fist was met again by another invisible barrier and again lightning arched across his skin.
<br><br>
	His chest scarred and his arms torn and bleeding, the massive beast stumbled back a few feet before an unseen force slammed into his stomach.  The monster fell to his knees, making the entire camp shake.  He tried to scream once more but found his lungs and throat being squeezed of air.  Both the giant's hands went to nurse his neck, and the monster writhed in horrible pain.
<br><br>
	Zisstrik only gave a toothy grin and waved his arms above him in the air.  The giant grabbed his head while tears poured from his eyes.
<br><br>
	"What are you?" Zisstrik's tongue curled around the words.
<br><br>
	"I… am… giant…"  the sand giant bellowed in a voice tinged with fear and desperation.
<br><br>
	"What are you!?"
<br><br>
	"I… am… servant…"
<br><br>
	Zisstrik's grin only widened and his hands twisted in the air with greater speeds.  "And who am I!?"
<br><br>
	The sand giant's eyes were rolled up into it's skull.  It's claws raked across the sands, leaving thick trails in the desert floor, and it's muscles were taught with anguish and fear.  For the first time ever, the beast stared fearfully into the jaws of death.
<br><br>
	"WHO AM I!?"  Zisstrik demanded again.
<br><br>
	"YOU… ARE… MASTER!"  The very foundation of the desert shook when the giant screamed his answer.  Trolls from everywhere in the camp sank to their knees in awe inspired fear, and the massive beast completely collapse into the sands from exhaustion.
<br><br>
	The prophet took one look around, lowered his arms, and filled the desert with terrible laughter.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
	Just the vile stench of the place made Edril sick.  To say the city was dirty would be an understatement, and both the elf and barbarian marveled at the sites to either side of them with looks of disgust as their aging wagon rattled forward.  Decrepit houses lined the sides of a dirt road, their largely oversized and overhanging thatched roofs casting long shadows across empty streets.  The city was dark even in the middle of the day, and not a single light flickered from any window.  From the garbage strewn darkness of numerous alleys or sometimes from the shadowed innards of lonely tent housing placed indiscriminately along the streets, the elf felt the sting of hundreds of hidden eyes watching the travelers pass by.  Watching and waiting.  And above it all, above the ramshackle tenements and jagged stone huts that formed the city's dark center, loomed a structure so horrible that Edril had to turn his eyes away.  It was the temple of Cazic-Thule, an obsidian monument to the deepest evils of Norrath, and it's dark walls seemed to suck the color even from the sky around it.  A chill wind twisted it's way down the city street and over the travelers, carrying with it the smell of blood.  Where the smell came from, the elf did not wish to know.  From somewhere a scream erupted and died, quickly drone out by the low chants emanating from the temple gates.
<br><br>
	Edril had been to Oggok, the city of the ogres, once in his travels.  There only the strong survived and the weak were hunted and killed for sport.  Days and nights were filled with wild cries of battle and the somber wails of the fallen.  The kingdom was ruled with tyranny and pain, the guards would sooner kill you then reason with you, and everyone's blood boiled with the anticipation of a war that never came.  Edril had thought that place a nightmare, but this city was far worse.  The elf found himself afraid.  But such was the nature of the black city of Grobb, kingdom of the trolls, where fear slithered down the streets from every corner.  It was surrounded on all sides by the dead lands of the Innothule swamp, a dark and infested area of horrible creatures and nightmarish scenery.  Suffering and pain pulsated from every crack in Grobb's surface, and at it's heart rested the gaping mouth entrance of the obsidian temple.
<br><br>
	The elf jumped when he felt a hand on his back.  "Calm down," Aryn spoke from behind him in a hushed voice.  The barbarian, who kept a steady hand placed on the thick sword at his side, still watched the passing houses carefully even as he spoke.  "Don't let it get to you, elf.  I feel it to."
<br><br>
	Edril shook his head and looked around.  "Almost like someone's watching us, isn't it?"
<br><br>
	Aryn nodded and scratched his bearded chin.  "Aye, feels that way."
<br><br>
	"They are.  They are watching you."  The voice was Jalic's, who drove the wagon from a seat up front, holding the reins to two horses tightly with both his green skinned claws.  Edril couldn't see Jalic's face from beneath the troll's hood.
<br><br>
	"Why are they?" Aryn, clad in chain mail and a light colored tunic, twisted his body around when he asked.
<br><br>
	"Because they are waiting for you to get off this wagon.  When that happens, they will kill you."
<br><br>
	Edril looked at Jalic with profound confusion while Aryn just shook his head and laughed.  "Why would they do that?" asked the elf, disturbed by the information.
<br><br>
	"It is the way of our kingdom."  The troll continued.  "Fear is our master.  It comes from the temple and spreads through the city like a disease, the divine hand of Cazic-Thule touching every house and every child.  But it is this fear which makes us strong, for once we master it then we can use it."  Jalic turned his head so that Edril could see the side of his face.  "They taste your fear.  They feed on it like dogs feed on table scraps.  And the blood of the fearful is that much sweeter."
<br><br>
	"But look at what it's done to your city."
<br><br>
	"Where you see horrid things, elf," the cart passed by numerous statues, carvings of gutted warriors or vicious demons whose gothic presence was felt up and down the temple road, "I see only beautiful flashes of pain."
<br><br>
	The wagon came to a slow and rattling halt at the end of the road, where the dirt street melded into a cobblestone path beyond the temple boundaries.  All along the temple gates hung trollish skulls from loose ropes, whose grinning teeth chimed against the metal as they swung back and forth from the wind.  A burly guard halted them at the entrance, spoke a few words to Jalic, and then reluctantly waved the wagon inside.  Aryn waved and smiled to the guard in passing.  The troll only bared his fangs and scowled in return.
<br><br>
	After a short ride along the cobblestones, the horses hoofs echoing a little too much in the silence of the city, Jalic lead the barbarian and the elf to a small door on the eastern side of the temple.  Grabbing a torch which hung next to the entrance and with a short "come on,"  Jalic opened wide the door which lead to a dark spiral staircase of black marble and began to descend.
<br><br>
	Edril marveled at the staircase as he too descended, what little he could see from Jalic's shallow torchlight.  All down and around the steps was carved the intricate body of a long serpent while hundreds of trolls, each etched with painstaking detail, murdered each other beneath the tail of the great dragon.  At the bottom of the staircase the three were met by another guard.  This one growled as they approached and held his sword up to his shoulder.
<br><br>
	"<em>Gerk tar dol lurz</em>."  Ordered Jalic with a motion of his arm.
<br><br>
	The guard answered in a deep and cracked voice.  "<em>Buz uzk kum</em>?"
<br><br>
	"<em>Ragdushimen dul dol batum</em>."
<br><br>
	The guard nodded and lowered his blade.  "Goot, goot.  Go in, head preest expect yoo."
<br><br>
	Jalic nodded his thanks and opened wide the door.  The room the three entered was a large cathedral of twisted sculptures and low hanging torches.  Four pillars supported an arched dome roof, and the floor was made of the same black marble the stairs were.  In the center of the room, on a raised dais, stood a shaking old troll who glittered from the golden pendants around his neck and the rings along his hand.  His green skin was wrinkled and pale, his ears were bent, his back was hunched over, and when he smiled Edril saw his fangs were black and chipped.  It seemed the troll's eyes were both permanently shut.  Jalic fell to his knees before the old one in reverence.
<br><br>
	"Welcome, welcome," the troll said in a quivering voice.  "Welcome at last.  Rise, Jalic, you have done well."
<br><br>
	Jalic picked himself up from the marble floor as Aryn stepped forward.  "You're Kul'Ash the high priest?" the barbarian asked.
<br><br>
	The old one laughed, a horrible wheezing sound devoid of all feeling.  "I am too old to be anything else."  He walked slowly forward and looked to Edril.  "I am glad you both have come.  I trust the journey was as uncomfortable as it could have been?"
<br><br>
	"Quite," the elf said, "I hope it was worth it."
<br><br>
	Kul'ash nodded his head slowly.  "Oh but it is, my boy, it is.  The temple has more gold then I know what to do with.  And if you complete this task for me I will give you more then enough."
<br><br>
	"What task?" Aryn asked as he took a step forward toward the high priest.  "What in the hells is this all about?  You're troll Jalic didn't tell us a thing."
<br><br>
	Kul'ash looked proudly upon Jalic and then turned again to the barbarian.  "As he was instructed not to.  This is a delicate situation.  The room you are in right now is reserved only for private ceremony unknown and unheard by Grobb's public.  This information is not to leave this room and the temple can in no way be involved.  Is this understood?"
<br><br>
	Aryn shrugged and nodded and Edril soon did the same.
<br><br>
	"Good," Kul'ash continued, "now as to the task, it is best described by telling the story of the troll the temple has branded Zisstrik the insane."
<br><br>
	"Zisstrik," Aryn turned to Edril, "that's the word we heard, only it was 'Zisstrik the prophet.'"
<br><br>
	"Where did you hear this?"  The high priest looked genuinely interested.
<br><br>
	"From the leader of a bandit group we destroyed many days ago.  His dying words."  The barbarian grinned.
<br><br>
	"Ah yes.  That's what his followers call him, a prophet, but I'll get to this later.  Please," Kul'ash extended a thin hand to the visitors, "have a seat."
<br><br>
	From previously unseen troll servants, two chairs slid out and Edril and Aryn sat down.  For the first time Edril really studied the room and found that they were not alone.  All along the walls in shadow sat groups of ogres and trolls, all seasoned warriors, who held various weapons tightly to their chests.  Edril wondered how he had missed them before.
<br><br>
	"You must not judge what I am about to tell you," began the old troll.  "It may seem cruel to you both but it is our customs.  But first I will explain the history of the trolls.  Perhaps this will better serve my purpose.  You must know that many would kill for the information I am about to give you, and few trolls are even allowed have this knowledge, under penalty of death.
<br><br>
	"The trolls do not originally come from Antonica.  Even our oldest statues here in Grobb are little more then a few centuries old.  Rather, ancient scrolls tell us we come from a land far away.  A land called Kunark.  There the trolls were born as savage beasts who killed each other for food and drink.  It was soon, however, that a powerful beast named Trakanon seized control of the trollish race and made us his servants.  For food and water exported from his jungle kingdom guarded by the highest mountains in Norrath, we split into clans and became his slaves.  The trolls flourished under him, becoming rulers of Kunark under the great dragon.  He was our father, and we worshipped him as a god.
<br><br>
	"But then the immortal simply changed his mind.  He grew savage and cruel, and watched as the trolls ran out of drink and sustenance.  He laughed as we starved.  We could not penetrate his mountain lair on Kunark, the peaks of the Trakanon's Teeth mountain range were too great for us to pass.  So to get our food we resorted back to our instincts.  In the shadow of the hills of disdain, a second war began and the fighting reduced the trolls to ashes.  On the field of bone, named for the countless skeletons of fallen trolls which litter the ground, one tribe survived under the great chief Nalikor.  He alone understood that Trakanon had abandoned the troll race.  Gathering what he could from Kunark, he sailed with his tribe to Antonica.
<br><br>
	"That was centuries ago.  Now the trolls have rebuilt themselves, and our ways are guided by the wisdom of Cazic-Thule."
<br><br>
	Aryn leaned forward and ran a hand along his tatooed face.  "So where does Zisstrik come in?"
<br><br>
	Kul'ash nodded.  "In order to use the fear of the temple better, our priests are often required to obtain trolls or other subjects for testing."
<br><br>
	Edril gave a look of disgust.  "Testing?"
<br><br>
	"They are exposed to a number of spells and tortured.  They become the epitomes of fear, and we learn from them.  We grow stronger from them."
<br><br>
	"Barbaric…"
<br><br>
	"Yes but it is our way.  Most die in a few days.  But Zisstrik did not.  Instead we threw him out of the temple once he outlived his usefulness.  We should have known then, but we were blind.  Our spells made him see and hear unusual things, which is why we called him Zisstrik the insane.  Since then he had been shunned and mistreated by everyone.  He was a nothing, but now…
<br><br>
	"You see he thinks Trakanon visited him in a vision.  He thinks the great dragon told him to rebuild the ancient tribes of old and march over the kingdoms of Antonica.  He thinks Trakanon is soon returning and that the temples must be destroyed.  He is spreading these words throughout the swamp, and trolls are joining him because they are intrigued by the promise of conquest.  It is in our nature.  But what they don't understand is that civil war almost destroyed us once, and if it is revived, it will surely be the end of the entire race.  What's worse is that he has the power to back his claims…"
<br><br>
	"Power?" Aryn asked.
<br><br>
	"Magic," the high priest answered.  "You must understand that shaman magic is unlike any other.  Where a cleric's magic is derived from prayer, a druid gets his magic from the earth, and a mage gets his power from the unknown, the ethereal, a shaman's power is derived from the very core of our being.  It comes from an understanding of ourselves, an innate and savage drive within us.  We could never have guessed the magnitude of the power of Zisstrik's will, nor could we have anticipated his intelligence.  All we know is that our spells woke something inside him, an inside power that flourished with his fear and self loathing.  His visions of Trakanon were merely this power's excuse of being released.  Now he has become one of the most powerful shamans I have ever known."  The high priest shook his head.  "He is a large threat to all of Antonica, and every day he gathers more followers he grows that much stronger.  If he gathers enough strength to attack Grobb then he is also free to turn his attention to Freeport and the commonlands.  So you understand the magnitude of this problem?"
<br><br>
	Edril and Aryn both sat in stunned silence.
<br><br>
	"We heard of your victory.  That is why I contacted you.  That is why I need you.  You are both experienced warriors and both unaligned with the temple in any way."
<br><br>
	Edril stood, his hand on the pommel of his sword.  "So what's the task?"
<br><br>
	The elf saw fire in the old troll's eyes, fire surrounded by hatred and great power.  "Hunt Zisstrik down.  Hunt him and then kill him."
<br><br>
	Aryn himself stood and threw his arms into the air.  "By ourselves!?  Are you mad!?"
<br><br>
	The high priest grinned.  "Certainly not.  I have gathered for you a collection of the finest warriors Oggok and Grobb have to offer.  All will not draw unwarranted attention to the temple."  With a graceful move of his hand, Kul'ash gestured to the shadow around the room.  "First two ogres, Gromlyko and Kugrokh."  Two massive beings, both standing a good 10 feet tall and armed from head to toe in jagged armor and wicked weapons, stepped from the darkness and reluctantly nodded their heads.  Scars of battle ran up and down their bodies.  "Next I give you three trolls lead by one captain: Snargob."  Three trolls with swords in hand followed close behind the largest of the four.  This troll, who glared at Edril with narrowed eyes, carried a bow on his back.  In both massive arms he cradled a great axe against his chest.  "And finally my own shaman Jalic will aid your journey.  This, my friends, will be your army.  So now it is up to you to make your choice.  What is your answer?"
<br><br>
	Aryn took one look around at the gathered soldiers, and shook his head.  With sympathetic eyes he looked to Edril.  "Remember what I told you, elf.  A warrior of Halas is always ready to die.  But then again I'm not wed, so the decision is yours to make."
<br><br>
	Edril turned his eyes away from the questioning looks of those gathered.  He focused on one dark section of the cathedral wall, and his thoughts drifted back to the city of Qeynos and to his wife.  "It's suicide.  If this Zisstrik is as powerful as you say then it's suicide…"
<br><br>
