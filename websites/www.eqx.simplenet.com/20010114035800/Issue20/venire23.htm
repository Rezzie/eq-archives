"Look here Solace" The Lich took the orb from Solace.
<br><br>
With one circular motion from the Lich’s arm a purple cloud appeared, and formed a
portal.  In the portal a harbor came into view.  A large cargo ship rested here.
The current lapped at her sides. The deck of the ship appeared very busy, the ship’s
crew scurrying diligently about preparing for voyage.

The vision roamed the length of the ship, and then turned downward, deep into the
cargo hold.  Hundreds of gigantic crates became visible.     As the ingress zoomed
in, the contents of one container become visible. Twenty skeletons could be observed
in the crate, and there were hundreds of crates.  Each skeleton was armed with short
sword and shield.  They stood motionless in the darkness, waiting for their master’s
next order.

"Master where might the destination of that ship be?" Solace said with an evil grin.
<br><br>
"Erudin" hissed the Lich.
<br><br>
The two of them laughed together.
