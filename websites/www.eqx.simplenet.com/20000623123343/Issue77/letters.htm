Hail all al EQX!
<br><br>
	I have a question about this permanent hit point loss referred to in <a href="../Issue76/death.htm">Onyx'
article</a> in issue 76. What is this all about? Please inform me, as I need all
the hit points I can get and I often throw my self into ludicrous situations
for no reason other than to see if I will live. Thanks for all your help.

Inspired by the critique of Dwarven Scotch-Irish dialect, and having been 
somewhat curious about how to speak in the manner of this race myself, I 
found a great URL for those with similar questions. It does adhere to the 
Scotch-Irish convention but gives far more specifics than I found elsewhere.

This is a letter from myself and Brorna
Anyone else notice the new fix on the Test server? A roleplay flag. Lets
examine, shall we?
<br><br>
A flag is required to denote that a particular character is roleplaying
rather than powergaming. Also note that Hook has left id software and is now
working for Verant. These statements lead one to the conclusion that the
acceptable and primary use of the game is powergaming or fragging. Therefore
the designers desire is that Everquest be simply a Quake engine on a grand
scale.
<br><br>
Not that I wouldn't mind some sort of HUGE multi-server linkage
QuakeWorld....but come on...this is EverQuest. Roleplay should be first and
formost, just as it advertises on the box.
<br><br>
The Flag involved should be the exact opposite, much like the /ANON flag.
People who desire to powergame and frag should type in /FRAG. At this point,
their name would go gray and easily distinguishable as nonRP. Players in
FRAG mode should also be limited as PvP and nonPvP are in that they cannot
buff/attack or interact with people not in FRAG mode.
<br><br>
I say we all need to FLOOD Verant with emails saying that is should be the
other way around - I cant believe this . They should make the powergaming
"KewLL DUdE" types wear the flags

In one of your articles you lament the reduction in the penalty for
death.
<br><br>
I wonder if you haven't grabbed the wrong end of the beast.
<br><br>
Instead of considering reincarnation an artifact of the gaming
experience shouldn't a roleplayer ask, what sort of society grows when
death is an inconvenience?
<br><br>
In a society of immortals, where tragedy means that you've permanently
lost the worldly possesions that were on your body at the time of death,
what is worth striving for? What distinguishes us from others in the
land.
<br><br>
Wouldn't the value of reputation, and the network of friends developed
over time be the really important values?
<br><br>
In such a society I think we are all eventualy condemned to the company
of our peers.

50% Less Experience Loss<br>
Another View
<br><br>
In your issue 76, <a href="../Issue76/death.htm">Onnie</a>, expressed his dislike of the reduction of
experience loss by 50% with the last patch.  He eloquently proposed that,
since death was caused by doing something stupid; we should be made to pay
for it!  With this I would agree IF all deaths were due to doing something
stupid, like jumping that creature that conned red because it is rumored to
have good loot or experience.  I submit the random killers in the game ie.
Griffons in the Commonlands, Dorn B'Dynn in the north desert and wandering
baddies like sand giants and hill giants (perhaps I have spent too much time
in and around Freeport).  Ah yes we can not forget the three outlaws to be
found near Highhold Pass.  Or, how about protectors of certain species such
as Cros Treewind and Holy Windstalker in Qeynos Hills.  There are many ways
to meet an untimely demise without doing anything 'stupid'.  With death
looking to get you at every turn (you have almost beat up that 'yellow'
creature, of course you are down to your last bubble due to the combat, when
a wandering madman or shrivvled mummy decides to help your hapless victim);
the reduction in experience loss is a welcomed relief.  You still have to
rememorize and recast all protective spells, and go back and recover your
corpse (no mean feat in some circumstances)  which consumes game time (for
some of us this is limited).  My character tends to have a pragmatic outlook
on death - remember who or what killed me and come back and pay it / them
back after reaching the appropriate level!  This reduction in experience
loss has made it easier to play my character the way I have been playing him
all along.  I still taunt creatures and take the hits for the casters in a
group.  I am still the last to leave a loosing battle when in a group,
especially if I am the high level one in the group.  I still jump in on
creatures without conning them first when someone nearby yells for help.
All these things I still do and die for them at times and every time I die I
thank Verant for the 50% reduction in experience loss!  The main change the
reduction in experience loss has had on my character is I will now enter
combat with criters that con even and sometimes yellow where before I only
battled blue critters.  There is still that moment of doubt "Can I really
take this creature I'm about to engage by myself!"; and the resultant surge
of joy when that iffy creature dies and I am standing over their bloody
corpse!  So, unlike Onnie, I welcomed the 50% experience loss and have only
found it to have a positive effect on gameplay!

<em>[Ed. - Onnie is a lady, first off.  And I would submit to you two things:  1) most of the 
things you described - like death by Cros or Holly, is death of your own fault.  Stupid, no, but you are responsible for it nonetheless.  2) 
You tell me that you can now play your character 'the way I have been playing him all along.'  
I still insist that the moment of doubt that you feel is minor, and is the result of a 
worry about a loss of some numbers, not a fear for your character.  Sure, you can be braver now, 
but not to save the lives of your friends at the risk of yours, but just because it's easy and safe.  
You risk nothing, you gain nothing.]</em>

I have read alot of articles about roleplaying and they are quit good.  But the way I have seen and read about druids dosen't appeal to me.  The way I roleplay my druid is quit different then the way a "good" druid should  be played.  One of my favorite things to do is to cast levitate on myself and go around telling people not to sit on the grass because that hurts the grass.  I all so like to yell at anyone wearing metal armor, because it was mined for Norrath.  You see by mining it, you are ruining the planet.  All my armor is leather and there for not ruining the world, only practicing the surivial of the fitest.  All so the dirty defilers that live in town and use so much stone to make there buildings are all so wrong.  Why do you need to make buildings so big?  A druid should only need to go to town if they need spells, other wise they can forage for food and sell extra items to players.  Towns and cities are what are destroying the planet.  
<br><br>
    What I have written above is how one character in a AD&D game acted when he was a druid.  It was quit a fun to DM the games with him in it, because he usally started alot of trouble and lead into some interesting stories.  I know that this may sound like a weird druid, but take it from a druids point of view.  Some one mined ore from the Norrath to make armor for them selfs beacause they are to weak to wear leather or cloth.  For some reason most players don't like when i roleplay my druid, but oh well some things in life aren't all ways nice and "good" all the time.

Absor--
<br><br> 
Good issue as always. I really like your idea for wars on religious ground and conversions, but I could see how the latter could be complicated.
 <br><br>
I want to tackle one point in your article; the experience loss section.  For just one moment I want to throw out the idea, I think, that's behind the move. The main complaint about EverQuest is that its an engrossing game. How could that be a complaint? Well, it means that in order to succeed you need to make a huge time investment. There are a lot of people --a lot-- who don't have as much time to spend on a game like EverQuest. Whether it'd be their off-line life or going onto other games like Asheron's Call, Middle Eath et al. they won't necessarily be devoting 4-5 hours a day of average game play time to the game. EverQuest, was never weekend warrior friendly. If you only have an hour to spend a day and you get killed once and lose all the experience you get, you would be, understandably, frustrated. After a while you would say this game just isn't worth it and you'd quit. You may say "Well, if you don't have the time don't play." That is just never ever going to happen by any gaming company. A game needs to be good while appealing to as many people as possible. The folks at Verant most likely want to allow everyone to be able to play this game.
<br><br>
Sardonic
<br><br>
<em>Actually, I only play about 10 hours a week.  Since release I've managed to get three characters to 7-8th level.  I am the epitome of the weekend warrior.
 <br><br>
I think you're falling into the trap that a lot of people fall into. Losing experience that takes, let's say, 2 hours to recover is exactly the same loss for me as it is for the player that plays 40 hours a week.  It still takes 2 hours to get it back.  Sure, for me that might be two evenings of play, and for the 40 hours player its half of an evening.  But it's the same amount of time.  So reduce the loss by cutting it in half, and the problem is still the same, I still lose one whole evening of play, and the other guy only loses about one fourth of one evening...
<br><br>
Really the experience lost has nothing to do with how much time you have to play.  If you're like me and only play on 2 nights a week and then for maybe 5 or 6 hours on Sunday, then you should be comfortable with the fact that you're not going to go up in levels as fast as others.  You also need to get comfortable with the fact that your not losing more experience or time then anyone else.
<br><br>
For me it's the actual playing that's fun.  Running around meeting people, learning the history and politics of the cities...  gaining a level for me is a real big deal because it only happens about once or twice a week (I'm still very low level, after all).  But I also am aware that I gain a level every few hours of play, and that's fine with me.
 <br><br>
My problem comes when there is no risk to adventuring.  When taking on the really nasty stuff (for my characters the nasty stuff is Scrawny Gnolls or lions), holds no risk then I will no longer care to do it.  What sort of an achievement is it then?  It's not much better then just writting up a 30th level D&D character, it just takes a lot longer.

To Absor:
<br><br>
You are truly in the minority then. For a lot of people the thrill comes out of advancement and nothing more. The game is trying to cater to as many as possible and I know many who get frustrated at the fact that they can't advance at a "normal" pace. People hate not being able to group with friends etc... because they are stuck levels behind. I think Verant wants to make up for the grouping restrictions...

(This is a response to <a href="../Issue76/edita.htm">Absor's editorial</a>. I don't load images as this is a
slow connection, so if he has an email address listed in the frame to the
left, I missed it. Sorry. For that matter, this might be long enough to be
it's own editorial. Oh well.)
<br><br>
I'm not a roleplayer; I get along with most roleplayers just fine (with the
exception of the bastards who slaughter people with trains or cast see invis
on DE guards and call it roleplaying, but that's another story...) but I
don't do it myself.
<br><br>
I understand the sentiments. To a roleplayer, the experience of being in
character outweighs everything else, including stats, levels, equipment,
etc. Death doesn't matter to an RP'ing paladin as long as he's saved someone
else's life in the process. Whether you're level 5 or 50 isn't important as
long as you can chat someone up in a tavern.
<br><br>
But you know what? It matters a lot to the rest of us. I CARE what level my
character is; I care about the equipment he's wearing; I damn well care
about the time I spent on the character. Having to rememorize spells, run
back to my corpse, then spend 4 hours re-leveling just to get back to where
I was IS a problem to me. I have the time- college will do that for you- but
I don't want to do it just because a newbie ran a train into me or a griffin
spawns right where I'm standing.
<br><br>
Furthermore, death, to the vast majority of EQ'ers, isn't a risk you take
that makes your heart pound; it's a necessary evil to be avoided as much as
possible no matter how much XP is lost. Believe me, people still avoid dying
as much as possible; they just spend one day getting back to where they were
instead of two. From my point of view, death hasn't been declawed, it's been
moderated to where I can just barely tolerate it instead of slamming down my
keyboard and walking away for the night.
<br><br>
And then there's stuff like this:
<br><br>
<em>I hated it when they made it so that low level characters don't lose any
experience for death. Hell, they gain food for dying!</em>
<br><br>
For God's sake, why is that a problem? Gee, let's make exploration at low
levels totally impossible by killing anyone who ever leaves a town. While
we're at it, let's make the guards indifferent to your plight, since you're
probably beneath their notice anyway. Are you supposed to make newbies
afraid to leave the town hall, much less the newbie zone, or can you
possibly let them wander into a dangerous area (heart probably pounding,
risk of death or no) without lowering them a level if an orc pawn with a
weapon runs past them? Bah.
<br><br>
<em>And you're stealing the heart of the game from the rest of us. You're
stealing the thrill of a good fight, the accomplishment of a risk well
rewarded. Hell, leveling is easy, so you're even stealing the value of being
a good powergamer.</em>
<br><br>
Leveling in this game is NOT easy. It's not even close. It takes even the
best powergamers two months to get to level 50, and that's the BEST. The
rank and file will take half a year or so, if they're lucky; on a toughness
scale of 1 to 10, MUD-wise, this game gets about a 9.5. Thrill of a good
fight? I don't seem to be thinking about reduced XP loss when I'm attacked
by a yellow con, but maybe that's just me. Risk rewarded? Most deaths are by
mobs 4 levels higher than you wandering in at a bad time- no risk there
except for being in the area at all. Of course, every area has insta-death
mobs, and newbies are supposed to lose XP for death too, so I guess everyone
should go into a tavern and drink some ale instead of wandering out at
all...
<br><br>
Going out on a limb with some detailed analysis, I think the problem you
have is due to soloing. This is not a game where people solo. There are
entire classes (my own primary class, that of the bard, comes to mind) which
are specifically tailored to grouping and against soloing, and for that
matter, almost every class simply has to group at some point. Furthermore,
grouping with stupid players, or greedy players, will kill you along with
them when they screw up- unfortunate, but true.
<br><br>
The point, though, isn't to "play the street cleaner" instead. It's to learn
from your mistakes, identify the smart players, and group with them. Of
course death with a street cleaner is pointless, because the character is,
too. The problem you face isn't that death has no meaning anymore- even if
it was still as painful as it was, I'd bet a lot of platinum you'd just find
another, easier zone and go do the same thing. The problem is that you don't
know what to do- soloing seems pointless, yet (dumb) groups just get
themselves killed.
<br><br>
I think what you need is a little while to sit down and think about what you
want to do in EQ. Maybe you're a true roleplayer, though it doesn't really
sound like it; in this case, you might do well to simply RP and forget about
experience until you find a guild that suits you. Maybe you simply picked
the wrong class for your play style; classes like clerics or druids don't
really need to group until much later in the game, while warriors always do.
Somehow, though, I think you missed the point; it isn't that waiting for a
train to come by for hours is bad because dying doesn't cost you enough,
it's that you really shouldn't be sitting on top of a hill waiting for the
train in the first place.
<br><br>
Good luck...
