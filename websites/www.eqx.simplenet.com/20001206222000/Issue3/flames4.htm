    align="JUSTIFY"><big><big>T</big></big>he next few days passed without event. I avoided the commons until that weeks end, when word that a second tower was being built. I sought Dach and we proceeded to locate Sphere with the purpose of asking him to reconsider his actions towards the several people days before. At great length we discussed the matter, and in the end all seemed well between Sphere, us and the public.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Dach left and I remained to do some finishing touches on our tower with Sphere. We talked about many things in general. There was mirth in the air, and we jested about the new tower. Its Title was to be The EQVault. We visited the place of the tower's construction, and noted a sign that Lord McQuaid would be present for the opening of the tower to the public. Lord McQuaid was rumored to announce a few things at this gathering. One of these announcements was related to the display of the Crown Jewels. I was not certain of this, but since both Sphere and I suspected it, I left to find out what could be heard before the event took place.</font> </p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">At the Castle library there was a rush amongst the scribes about said announcements. I leafed through a stack of scrolls that was left near a stamp bearing the Lord's Signature. The responsible scribe was distracted for a moment and I glanced at the contents of the scroll. It confirmed my belief; it was a sign to be posted announcing the display of the Crown Jewels, no doubt to be placed upon the exterior of the EQVault Tower during the event. I returned to the EQU to inform Sphere of my findings.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"We must get the attention for the announcement before the other tower. Scribe a similar document and nail it up on our tower for all to see. This will gain favor for the EQU tower," Sphere said to me. "Then I will send thee to the commons to spread the word."</p>

</td>
 <td valign="top" style="text-align: justify" width="31%"><font face="boldPS" size="3"><p align="JUSTIFY">So I did. I made the scroll and nailed it, then proceeded to the commons. To my surprise, many people greeted me and looked to me to hear what i had to say. I expected to be shunned for remaining with Sphere when so many now hated him. Noble Dach was here, and seemed to have made peace with the enemies of Sphere. It seemed that perhaps he was no longer friends with Sphere at all. Many a gentleman and pleasant folk persuaded me to leave Sphere's side. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I made the announcement anyway, with doubt as to my cause. Nearly instantly a shrouded man approached from the shadows and spoke to me in hushed tones. I could not identify him for certain, but he spoke with a Nobleman's voice: "I ask that you remove any said scrolls from your tower walls and correct yourself in public. That announcement is a gift from the Lord to us during our celebration."</p>
<p align="justify">Thus I spoke, calling the public to not mind my announcement and that the scroll would no longer be on the EQU towers. I made haste and removed it. Sphere met me at the foyer in disgust.</p>
<p align="justify">"You can be the public servant. I shall remain in the tower, and not return to the commons, and will no longer bother the people. I will not attend the event at the other tower nor in the commons. I am through taking this abuse from everyone," Sphere said.</p>
<p align="justify">I hesitated, giving him a long look, and waited for him to speak again.</p>
<p align="justify">"Go now Ian Ash, attend the event and talk amongst the people and make friends. Make sure to record as much as possible so that we may make sure this new tower never rivals mine." Sphere left for his chambers. I left for the event, which was underway.</p>

<td valign="top" style="text-align: justify" width="37%"><font face="boldPS" size="3">
<p align="JUSTIFY">I was glad to see that the announcement of the Crown Jewels Display seemed new to everyone, and that there was great joy in the air. Every member of nobility was here less Sphere. There was the Dukes Grail and ChrisLTD of the EQVault, Trix of the Fortress WarZone, LaWizard and others all enjoying the company of Lord McQuaid. Even the likes of famous scofflaws showed without fear of being arrested, like Hobbes and Rainz. They were given equal treatment, and the party was a grand one.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">In a corner I spoke with Dach about Sphere's madness. We thought that we were in danger, and that the conflict between EQU and EQVault would surely bring us both our deaths, if not literally. No matter the fate it would be undeserving of the Noble Dach to suffer for his allegiances. I feared my own life forfeit.</font></p>
<p align="justify">I addressed the Dukes Grail and ChrisLTD of the EQVault in turn, confessing my role in EQU's attempt to take the wind from their sails, and confessing my intentions to leave EQU. I was beyond lost honor knowing tomorrow I would be homeless, and announced to the group I had left EQU for personal reasons since last in the commons. The cheers still ring in my head, as Dach announced the same.</p>
<p align="justify">An hour or so later, after leaving note for Sphere and returning to the commons to rejoin the party, I noticed smoke coming from the horizon near the EQU tower. Hushed voices on the wind carried word that the predicted conflict was going to be great indeed. The dogs barked late into the night at the fires of hate were built.</p>
<p align="justify">Sphere had flown into a rage, gathering an army for war. Who can blame him for not understanding it was his own conflict that, in the end, drove his allies away. Trix, who provided the land that EQU was built on, some how wrestled control of EQU from Sphere, and Sphere took his armies and seemed to have left the tower as well. Sphere's unnamed soldiers have since been noted to harass the pleasant folk at the expense of the EQVault, or sometimes harass the residents of the EQVault at the expense of the pleasant folk. So the sad story may end, or perhaps never.</p>
