Well when i first herd about EQ i thought it was just a UO clone and that
it would generally suck. I was board one day so i decided to ask a friend
that quit UO what the EQ websight was. I went there and to my surpise it
was nothing like UO. I was overjoyed on how it took advantage of 3d cards
and 3d sound and the option for multiple views. The character races/classes
seemed kinda lame but i guess they could be cool personally i dont think
you should be limited on any type of skill perhaps just the stats to use
them efficantly.<br>
	Anyways i continued to read the FAQ and i was becoming more and more
impressed with EQ until i read 1 thing, the PK switch. In my opinion that
and the major character damage that happens when you die will kill the
game.
<br><br>
1. Who will want to be a pk when your character gets all messed up when you
die?<br>
2. People will want to make new characters when they accidently become a
PK, eventually macking them quit EQ.<br>
3. No one will lose their items and weaopons and will just succeed in the
game and nevar go through rough times, this will cause people to become
extreamly rich and become maxed out or extreamly powerful and eventually
get board of the game and quit.<br>
4. There will be little or no challange (unless the creature population
sucks) in making money and saving for an elaborate home or boat so people
will have done pretty much all their is to do with their cash.
<br><br>
	In my opinion the PK switch is going to attaract alot of those beggars who
walk the streats of UO saying they got PK'd, in my opinion if they dont
know how to play or are to lazy to work for their money i could care less
if they play, in UO i dont know how many hours i spent chopping wood and
beating on the mountian and smithing so i could finnaly start getting
cashflow coming, eaven today i only have 26k in the bank.

I am not a PK in UO, i have a dread lord character but i rarely play with
him. Personally i am glad that people do not get to save their stuff and
get to hoard all of the best crap in the game. PK's keep people from doing
that, then some anti's go and kill pk's and your stuff gets circulated
around some more. i have not died by the hands of a monster in who knows
how long and the only thing that can kill me is people (and the most
powerful of cratures that i just stay away from), and i think it would be a
pretty lame game if you could nevar die in it (some people say its lame
anyways, but they are usually those beggars).
<br><br>
	Now annoying 2 year olds are going to follow you around spamming at you
and are going to be looting your house right in frount of you because you
cannot attack them since they are some wuss with the Pk switch off and you
can do nothing to them because of that. Here are some sugjestions that i
think would keep Pking down and help reduce antisocial behavior.
<br><br>
1. Pk's are not allowed in town.<br>
2. Town is a fun exciting place to be, put neat stuff in town, A nightly
feast, contests to win prizes, mabie a pianyattas, hope i spelled that
right (it is a large figure from mexican culture usually in some animal
form that is made of paper and is beaten with a stick untill it breaks and
prizes fall out), have archery tournaments and many other things to make
people want to go to town.<br>
3. If you do not eat something bad will happen like you move slower or
swing slower, not starve to death though, this would make PK's half to hunt
for food every so often and not just people all the time, they would also
half to have the ability to kindle fire or some type of fire spell to cook
the food with. (would also make druids a valuable member to a group of pk's
since he can summon food)<br>
(dont forget there are nightly feasts in town)





<td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align: justify"> <span style="text-align: justify">

4.there is a reward for returning the head (or some form of proof that you
killed the villan)to the town guards, this would encourage Pk's to be
hunted and looked for and they might half to flee a certian area if the
became a little to infamous.<br>
5. There needs to be a way for a Pk to regain rights to town, mabie he
would half to help an NPC in some type of work or would half to serve time
repaying the community in some way(and stop killing ofcorse), at least give
them a chance to go good so they are not forced to kill other people.<br>
6. do not forget, since gate travel or recall or whatever is a very high
level spell and only certian classes and races will be able to cast it,
this will prevent pk's from terrorizing the whole world.
<br><br>
Benifits from this
<br><br>
1, spice added to the game, you would want to avoid places where murders
are known to happen and want to use backroads to get to certian places.
2. annoying newbies cannot just run in your house and jack stuff, loot your
kills, and just be a pest without any concaquences.(not only newbies do
this)<br>
3. Pk's would want to form a community of some sort wich would just let
people have an overall funner time.<br>
4. people will concider taking their 3 billion Ar suit and 4 thousand
damaging sword (yes i am exageraiting) to certian places.<br>
5. Fighitng pk's is fun
<br><br>
	In my opinion the PK switch is just a sign of lazynes into developing a
finer system, personally i think the reputation system in UO sounsd good,
and the notor system is fine, there is just no incentive not to Pk in that
game, and thats what we need to see in EQ reason to go to town, the life of
a Pk should be a a hard one, but a good one if done right.
