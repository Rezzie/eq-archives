  Pen is Mightier than the Cursor</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I&#146;ve been 
  on a long hiatus from online RPGs. It has lasted coming close to six months 
  now. Ill log on to EQ once every few weeks or so just to play a nasty Dark Elf 
  cleric and keep looking for something I could have sworn was there. New developments 
  in my personal life have a good deal to do with my absence but an underlying 
  dissatisfaction is equally to blame. I really haven&#146;t run into an online 
  game lately that makes, what I consider to be role playing easy or even really 
  gives it much support. Of course, lately, I&#146;ve been playing those huge 
  commercial MMORPGs such as EQ. Most are good games with good intentions and 
  concepts but just end up falling short IMO. None of them have a gold piece on 
  a good, privately run MUD, or even a copper piece on a good, old fashioned, 
  pen and paper game.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After playing MMORPGs 
  for a few years now, I&#146;ve sort of come to a defeatist conclusion that &#147;Massive&#148; 
  and &#147;Commercial&#148; are death knells for &#147;Role Playing&#148;. The 
  logistics of keeping a dynamic vibrant world, the disparity of schedule for 
  the thousands (or tens of thousands) of players. It all gives me a headache 
  just trying to keep thinking of ways to bring a vibrant online world to life 
  in such a way that &#147;events&#148; are the rule and not the exception and 
  that intrigue is as key to the game as the &#145;lewt&#146;. I&#146;ve got to 
  give the industry a break though. They&#146;re a new phenomenon and its creators 
  are walking uncharted territory.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So while I&#146;ve 
  drifted from my CRPG addiction, I haven&#146;t drifted from my long term obsession 
  with pen and paper gaming. I used to ride my bike to a friends house when I 
  was a kid and we&#146;d run single player campaigns for each other, occasionally 
  conning his older brother into DMing for us. When I &#147;grew up&#148;, gaming 
  became something way to &#147;geeky&#148; to participate in. At one point, in 
  high school, I swallowed my immature pride and tried to convince some guys I 
  wanted in on their DnD game. They were too suspicious of my motives and all 
  I received were accusations of foul intentions and looks of incredulity. I then 
  tried to convince some of my friends (who used to play but also &#147;grew out 
  of it&#148;) that we should start up a game again. I always just received a 
  lukewarm &#147;yeah, we ought to do that&#133;someday&#148; response. Occasionally 
  it was accompanied by the looks one might give a mental patient that had just 
  asked for a straight razor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, CRPGs 
  hardly received the same scrutiny. I suppose using your imagination is a much 
  greater sin than staring blankly at a screen for hours on end. So, mostly starting 
  with Wizardry, I fed my desire to play a good RPG with these automated substitutes. 
  When I first got online, using the dial up account of a friend who was in college, 
  I discovered the world of MUDding. A whole new gateway was opened. Now I could 
  revel in my inner &#147;geekdom&#148; with fellow anonymous players who were 
  looking for the same experience. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I had pretty much 
  given up on the idea of ever playing a pen and paper game again when during 
  a new student orientation at the university I had transferred to, I ran across 
  a campus organization for War and Role Playing games. Interested in the opportunity, 
  I joined the club and later that week got back into playing pen and paper RPGs. 
  I suppose it&#146;s been about 6 years or so now that I have been playing pen 
  and paper RPGs again on a regular basis. I really enjoy it; returning to that 
  world of pure imagination was like rediscovering an old friend. And, speaking 
  from years of CRPG experience (on and off line). No computer medium can really 
  capture it for me. I&#146;ve had a few privately run, close knit MUDs come close 
  to offering the same experience as a good table top game; but there&#146;s something 
  about the immediacy of the Pen and Paper experience and the lack of that clunky 
  digital communications anchor between you and the virtual world. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently I&#146;ve 
  given up my normal position as DM and am playing in a friend&#146;s campaign. 
  Elyas, my druid with a high, yet very selective, charisma is a real blast to 
  play. While normally neutral to the conflicts of most &#145;civilized&#146; 
  societies, a certain army has decided to declare war on the elven kingdom. Elyas 
  could normally care less, however, this army has decided that the best way to 
  deal with the elves is to slowly clear cut the woods, creating a slash and burn 
  swathe to the elven capital. Every person in that army is now Elyas&#146; sworn 
  enemy. The rest of the party is of similar persuasion. The human knight is from 
  a land which has been at war with the army in question for hundreds of years. 
  The elven mage-thief in the party obviously has no love for them. The remaining 
  thief has simply found our party is just really good at finding shiny things, 
  which, much to her enjoyment, the druid really has no use for (which increases 
  her shares.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have been playing 
  for about a year and the campaign has seen the characters from first level all 
  the way to upwards of tenth (my druid) level. There have been many glorious 
  adventures and many clashes with this encroaching army. None of this would have 
  been well served or even marginally reproduced by a computer medium. My druid 
  has dotted miles of countryside with hallucinatory forests to slow the incoming 
  army; the knight has proven on several occasions that he is worth more than 
  the glowing sword at his side; the elven mage thief has angered a minor deity 
  by pocketing some select gems from her sacrificial fountain; the thief, in search 
  of revenge, has made it her life quest to &#147;find that damn guy who sold 
  her the fake potions&#148;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this month 
  we decided that our characters had accumulated quite a bit of recognition and, 
  more importantly, wealth. Many are well known enough that they may soon find 
  themselves being sought out by more than just the bounty hunters and elite death 
  squads of the army we have declared war on. They&#146;ll soon be called on by 
  fellow adventurers ready to swear oaths of loyalty. Further, our reinforced 
  tank of a wagon is getting pretty full. Top this off with the two regular NPCs, 
  along with my Druid&#146;s pet tiger, the thief-mage&#146;s owl familiar, the 
  knight&#146;s faithful warhorse and a team of very stout horses, and we either 
  look like a circus sideshow or an entry in the Macy&#146;s day parade. So, our 
  group decided it was time to build a stronghold (much to my Druid&#146;s disinterest.) 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without the need 
  to wait for patches and updates or having to deal with broken economies and 
  urban sprawl (a la UO), we were able to sketch out our own little keep and find 
  just the right place to put it. No one is going to stand out front of our groups 
  front door, drop 255 crates in just the right place and walk through the wall. 
  We won&#146;t need to reduce our index fingers to bloody stumps waiting for 
  the DM to hand us quaint little messages like &#147;you have become better at 
  masonry&#148;. My druid will be able to cordially talk a family of eagles into 
  being lookouts without their deciding to peck my eyes out 2 hours later. Most 
  importantly, my druid will most likely never been accosted by a stranger and 
  asked to have an adult female swine hurled upon them (u cast sow?).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I suppose its obvious 
  what I&#146;m getting at here. I don&#146;t want to just sound like I&#146;m 
  slamming the whole CRPG industry though. Its an amazing thing to be sure. The 
  internet, online gaming and the brave new MMORPG genre are all simply phenomenal. 
  Its an exciting thing to be a part of. Watching and participating in the growth 
  of the online CRPG industry is a real treat. I&#146;ve made some good friends 
  doing it, played some great games, and have had some great experiences. I wouldn&#146;t 
  advocate giving up on them entirely. It will continue to grow and become more 
  and more fascinating as time and technology move along.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, they still 
  shadow the simple pen and paper experience. It has continuously evaded pure 
  expression in the digital world and will probably continue to do so for quite 
  some time. So, if any of you fellow EQ players ever happen to get the chance 
  to sit down around a table with some character sheets and some very funny looking 
  dice; by all means do it. You definitely wont regret it. </font></p>
