<B>Please Note:</B> EverQuest Express is not the official voice of Verant
Interactive, makers of EverQuest. We cannot answer questions about payment 
methods, hardware requirements (i.e. video cards), or technical details about 
the game. This Q&A is meant to cover gameplay issues only. Thank you for 
understanding.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Specialize skill, and how does it work?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;After reaching a certain level, magic classes can specialize in one spell skill. This will provide added bonuses to all spells that are based on that skill. It may help you deal out more damage or cast the same spell using less mana, for example. The amount of bonus, of course, depends on your level in the specialize skill.  There are unconfirmed reports that specialization is not yet completely implemented.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize that there are artifacts that are extremely rare to come by. However, are there any spells that are the same way? Maybe spells that only a few people will ever have?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were plans to have some spells be very difficult to attain. These may be acquired through quests or by traveling to a remote and dangerous locale. Whether these are in the game yet or not remains a mystery.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you die if you don't eat?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you cannot starve to death. However, you will not heal either, so you may die from something attacking you.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an observable leveling benefit to being Human? I would like to play a Ranger and hopefully offset the Exp penalty of that class.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is a noticeable difference in experience gain when you play a human versus another penalized race.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly is being banned? Do they delete your character(s), make you start over with all of them, delete your account, or ban your credit card?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who is banned will have their account deleted. The only way to get a new one is to purchase another copy of the game and get a new key. Of course, the player would have to put in different registration information. Regardless, it would be much easier if everyone just behaved themselves.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can a warrior bash and kick simultaneously?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No, only one special combat attack skill can be used at a time. When you click the kick button, you will notice the bash button is disabled as well.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been told when trying to train up a trade skill (after a certain skill level) that I require something along the lines of "advanced trade skills".  Are there master trainers who can train you further, or is this message just a polite way of saying "get your butt out of here and practice the skill yourself"? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a polite way of saying if you want to be proficient in trade skills, you'll have to put in a lot of practice time and money for components to get to that point. Have a nice day.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering if it is okay for a troll/ogre character to say things like "wat u doin?", "dood u sux maan!" or "i kik but man". Besides the fact that these are 90's slang, would it be role-playing talking like that? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This becomes a matter of opinion and can generate heated debates. What is roleplaying? This could make for a long and descriptive EXPRESSions article. However, amongst the general roleplaying community, I think most would agree that the phrases you cite are not proper roleplaying for the high fantasy genre. Typically anything with "dood" is out of the question, and the "u" abbreviation is considered "dewdspeak" as well. How you choose to role play your troll/ogre is a personal choice, however.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you advance past a certain level there's always those green guys that you hit once and they "try" to run away. When you get to L50 will all the creatures be like that? Will they all "attempt" to run away?(minus those few suicidal guys such as skeletons, etc.)
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As you get higher in level, previously aggressive monsters will tend to not attack you. This is a wonderful thing for your long distance traveling, when you don't wish to keep batting away a dozen black wolves. Is it possible to eventually reach a point where even the guards don't attack? Doubtful. Only a couple people have ever reached level 50, so how the game behaves is still generally unknown, though.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There seem to be a number of skills I have which never increase as I continue to use them.  Examples of these are Hide and Sneak.  Are there some skills which are level based and are not dependent upon practice?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Without knowing your race, it is difficult to know for sure. However, if you are a halfling, then you may begin with hide and sneak, or gain them at an early level. Your starting skill level in these skills may be higher than the standard max for your level, in which case you may not see an increase until you advance to say, level 10, for example. All skills are based in part on the skill level.

<BR><BR>

<B>Corrections</B><BR>
A handful of people wrote in to provide the standard formula for the maximum skill level at a given player level. The formula was intentionally left out, because Verant can change or tweak skill maximums for individual races, classes, or everyone at any time. EverQuest Express has also chosen not to reveal formulas used in calculating the various values and chances used in the game. In this case, it is a generally obvious formula, so you shouldn't have any trouble figuring it out on your own.
