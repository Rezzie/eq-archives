This week I want to go over one of the most hacked topics ever.  I want to talk about the conflict that exists between hard-core roleplayers and hard-core powergamers.  More specifically I want to talk about the stereotypes that are necessary to make that whole conflict exist.  Even more specifically, I want to talk about the hard-core roleplayer stereotype.  It's funny what actually talking to a real-life stereotype can inspire in a person.
<br><br>
I was cruising one of the larger web boards just to see what was up.  I saw post with a lot of replies, so I read it.  I don't remember the name of the poster, and I really don't care to.  But he (she?) was ranting about how all of the real roleplayers have to stand up for themselves and teach a lesson to all of the people that insist on shouting play-off scores around the zone.  He was advocating immediately dueling anyone that broke the unwritten rules of roleplaying.  He was encouraging us to drive them all from the server.  They could be evil, disruptive people on one of the other servers, but not on the one where this stereotype played.  With our help this person was going to drive out all the evil and save the server.
<br><br>
And mixed in were more than a reasonable number of comments about the stereotypical powergamer/d00d.  This I found funny.  I haven't seen more than a handful of people that I would be willing to accuse of being the stereotypical powergamer.  I think I might have met a small band of them in HighHold just last night.  But then they wouldn't help me get the heck out of HighHold and on to Qeynos, so maybe I was just pissed off and decided to label them powergamers.   Maybe they just didn't hear me asking all nice-like for directions.  Or maybe they were all playing snobs that don't like mere Human mercenaries.  Well, they were all of the same guild, maybe it was a snob only guild.
<br><br>
But in most cases where I have been tempted to label someone, a little further investigation has usually shown me that I was wrong.  I got really mad at someone once who trained skeletons all over me twice in a row, getting a newbie killed, but only pestering me.  He did it on purpose, he told me so.  But after a bit of discussion I discovered that he thought I had taken a kill from him, when I had thought he had tried to steal it from me.  We never became friends or anything.  But I think we both came to understand that it was a misunderstanding and we even once helped each other with minor spell buffs.  Almost like an apology, though we never spoke again.
<br><br>
But no, I'm convinced that this person is actually one of those roleplaying extremists.  I contend that the stereotype is completely impossible by its very nature, but that does not stop this person from meeting it's criteria.  As I know it the criteria are something like:  always in character, hates people that are not in character, never cares how quickly they are leveling, never 'camps' a monster to get a specific item, attacks non-roleplayers (which seems to be almost everyone) whenever they do anything out of character, always uses Thee and Thou when speaking, and is willing to force this viewpoint on everyone in the area, and even those just a bit outside the area.  From his posts, this person seemed like he met all the criteria.
<br><br>
But I contend that this person is NOT a roleplayer, not in spirit anyhow.  Maybe in action (except for the Thee and Thou thing… does anyone actually do that?), but not in the heart of the matter.
<br><br>
In our regular weekly-except-for-lately game sessions we roleplay about, oh, a third of the time.  One third of the time is spent just doing and saying out of character things, like; "Pass me those cookies," and "That's MY soda, ya jerk!" and maybe a bit of "What? Are you an idiot?"  Well, maybe not that harsh.  But we talk about all sorts of things that are not gaming related, after all these are old friends and this is the only time most of us get to see each other.  And the other third is spent talking about the game.  Which rules we hate.  Comments about why the hell did you do that, is your character an idiot?  Often this is done smack dab in the middle of a tense roleplaying moment, and that's when I become the roleplaying extremist.  I don't mind one bit if the general tone is out of character.  But I get a bit pissed when I'm negotiating with a vital NPC and something I say or the GM says sparks a long string of out of character drivel, ruining the continuity of the conversation with the NPC.  Or when someone says something that they intend out of character at a tight moment, and someone else reacts to it in character.  Those are the worst.  Imagine that you're in the presence of the Prince of a city (World of Darkenss here) and one of your group busts out with something that sounds in character like and insult.  Maybe he says something snide about the Princes name.  The GM reacts in character, ripping the PCs mind to shreds, only to have the player raise his hand and say that he wasn't talking in character, he was just making an observation as a player…
<br><br>
And I think that once you've seen that a few too many times you can become a bit of an extremist.  It really ruins the game.
<br><br>
What was my point?  Oh, that the extremist stereotype is NOT a roleplayer.  Can't be.  Nobody can claim to really be a roleplayer and at the same time actively drive people away from roleplaying.
<br><br>
In that thread with this extremist someone said that this person was exactly the reason that he hated roleplayers.  When I read the post I immediately thought of Wally George.  I don't know if anyone out there knows him.  He had (has?  Is he still out there) a television show on which he espoused his conservative views.  I wasn't a regular viewer of the show, but I got an impression when I watched him.  I thought that he must be a liberal in his real life, because watching him on television could only make people hate those that call themselves conservative.  He took it to such an extreme as to make himself, and therefore his views, look completely foolish.  The roleplaying extremist as described by the stereotype and by that poster makes roleplayers look like nasty fools.  I contend that the poster that seemed so much like that stereotype is a powergamer when he isn't posting to web boards.  Because anyone that 'gets it' about roleplaying just couldn't be such an ass.
<br><br>
Our next issue is dedicated to roleplaying.  I've already received an article that will really show the right way to make your server into a roleplaying server.  You can't force anyone to roleplay.  People either 'get it' or they don't.  You can only help them 'get it'.  There's a reason that people with a lot of brains and education become teachers.  There's a tremendous thrill that you get when you teach someone something and they suddenly 'get it'.  When it comes to roleplaying, teach by example.  Teach, don't preach.  And certainly do not threaten.
