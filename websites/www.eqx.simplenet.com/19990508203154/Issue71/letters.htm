First, thank you for the great newsletter.  I may not always agree with the views presented or the semi-pornographic art work, but I think it is a good effort and a help in community building.
 <br><br>
I thought Snafu's <a href="../Issue70/stereo.htm">article</a> in issue 70 on stereotypes was interesting.  However, one can only hope his liberal use of Real-Life stereotypes was part of the satire along with his over-the-top IC examples and that he was not serious in his use of what would be good role-playing.
 <br><br>
Being near 30, I am finding it harder and harder as time goes on to not succumb to the stereotype of the obnoxious 11-year old or the 10-year old up past their bedtime (not to mention the other classic stereotypes of teens in online game play).  However, while some of these stereotypes may be true, you are going to find out that a lot more of these people are in fact in their twenties and older.  One of the best lessons of online gaming is that emotional maturity should not be confused with age in any way shape or form, especially when the anonymity of the internet is brought into play.
 <br><br>
Snafu also tries to draw a distinction between the shadowknight who just-wants-to-be-friends and the troll-raised-by-humans, with the former being some sort of pathetic power-gamer's ploy and the latter being an excellent example of role-playing.  Snafu needs to revisit gaming 101.  The latter and all the minor variations are one of the broadest and most abused examples of stereotypes in gaming there is.  It is one of the classic power-gamer's excuses for trying to avoid the built-in social balances of a powerful character/profession/whatever, in addition to be being one of the most tired and re-hashed concepts in gaming.  
 <br><br>
People look to fictional works where a character has such a background and works because of the context of the novel, then en masse' translate the concept to a single game.  When you are in a large online RPG (or even a table-top group or gaming society) and this has been done already, by many, it becomes almost a worse offense than the shadowknight's behavior.  At least I can reconcile the shadowknight in my own role-play by keeping in mind that he's really evil at the core and is just putting on a friendly facade to use people and to build his own dark powers that are antithetical to everything my character believes.
 <br><br>
My personal reaction to stereotypes in EQ has been to use them more and more often when I see countless people trying to use these tired and self-serving excuses for role-playing in an orgy of power-play and avoidance of one of core penalties built into their race/profession choice.  Thank goodness the NPCs are not as easily fooled or as willing to cooperate as most players.
 <br><br>
The circumvention of the racial and professional biases built into this game world should not be so easy as claiming to be a nice guy raised by sainted humans, but something that occurs over protracted contact and successful role-playing.  
 <br><br>
Rather than minimize it, I say strengthen the use of bigotry in role-play in EQ in the face of players who seem in capable of balancing self-interest with role-playing.  I just love the ones who on one hand condemn Tovax and on the other beg an unknown PC necromancer to find their corpse or the dark elf  who for claims (in OOC) to be unlike her kin when she needs help but gleefully steals kills at every opportunity, for example.

Thanks absor for bringing out such an enjoyable product to pursue . I admit i havent been keeping up for a while since i gotten into the game [grin] . First of thank foxglove for an <a href="../Issue69/parttime.htm">article</a> which matches my thoughts. I started late and have watched my friends acellerate to level 14 while i languish as a level 5 bard ( sad harmonies my specialty ) . Still i do have anohter character to join them but being a troll and trying to socialise with your elven buddies sorta makes things difficult :) .
 <br><br>
I believe that bugs arent the issue . More like how the players use them . Verant is trying to fix the bugs , balance the game (i play alot of blues for enchanters ) add new stuff , etc . Twinking , explioting are real serious issues and i strongly believe that verant's stance on banning is a good thing in the long run , its even good in the short run . This is a game , and it is a shared one . Anything that will wreck another players enjoyment will seriuosly be looked at. Players might argue that individual twinking and self improvement isnt gonna affect everyone else but it does . It always affects someone else regardless of the morality involved . 
 <br><br>
All in all great mag and keep up the good work . Now i must get back to keeping up with the Jone'sess .:)

When i go to my favorite everquest website and her news of a new issue
of eqx i go to the website and always read the q&a first. I like the way
he gives some answers in a funny way. I have never needed to ask a
question though but if i ever do i know i can count on wynn for
answering it. Well i love the site and keep those issues rolling:)
