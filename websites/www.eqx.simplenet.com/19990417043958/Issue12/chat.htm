	<big><big>I</big></big> suspect that this has been done over and over again across the Internet by now.  I am certain that dozens of web sites have posted their opinions.  Hundreds of you have hashed and re-hashed this over IRC, IQC and in the ICU.  And all of you have read and thought about it.  By now, you’re tired of it.  But I still wanted to give you my interpretation on this.
<br><br>
I have dissected the chat log from the IRC meeting on March 3, 1998 with Brad McQuaid.  There was a lot of new information to be found there.  Don’t worry, I’m not going to go over every question.  But I did want to extrapolate as far as I thought logical from a few of the answers and toss in a few opinions for good measure.  I thought that some of the answers lead to some interesting probabilities.
<br><br>
Oh, in case you didn’t know, it seems that Brad was disguised as DrBunny for this chat...  I also edited some of the questions for spelling.  Habit.

<em>*Thayer*</em> Are the classes of magic in EverQuest individual to each class that uses them? For example, can any class learn from 2 different classes of magic?
<br><br>
<em>[DrBunny]</em>. Most of the spells are unique to that class, however there is some overlap. For instance, both a cleric and a shaman can cast healing spells. The exact nature of these spells and their names might be different though.
<br><br>
<em>Me:</em>  Well, there is a lot of information here if you are willing to extrude and expand.  Firstly it confirms that the EQ team is dedicated to the idea of separate classes.  From this I feel certain that we will never see a tank mage in EQ.  It also tells me that each of the types of magic user (Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer and Wizard) will be very distinct classes.  Not just variations of the same stock class.  I would not expect to see an enchanter casting a fireball, or a wizard creating a zombie.
