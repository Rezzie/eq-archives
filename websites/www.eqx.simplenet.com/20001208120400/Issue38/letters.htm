Oghma's article '<a href="../issue37/shake.htm">How to shake up the Eq community</a>'...
<br><br>
..was not satire, it was pure reality.
<br><br>
Keep up the good work.

Your article, "<a href="../issue37/shake.htm">How to shake up the Eq community</a>", proved to be a very
pleasant lecture. It was very very funny ! Thanks for writing it. I
especially enjoyed this part : "In my programming experience, you can't send
a PvP packet through a network without having it affect a non-PvP packet, so
why bother!".
<br><br>
Keep up the good work !

Thank you!  I wrote that article after I saw 4 or 5 message board posts in
10 mintues which asked a question which was on the FAQ.  I guess it
snowballed from there...

Archanalia,
<br><br>
I suppose now this means clerics and other healer-types who can
resurrect will actually have considerable value to adventuring parties.
;)

Thanks for the <a href="../issue37/force.htm">article</a>.  I enjoyed it!
