What is it about role-playing that grabs our attention? Why are we all salivating for a game which essentially is no different than a MUD or a good session with a paper and pencil RPG? What is it about this experience which drives us to buy $500 worth of upgrades to our PCs with just the promise of a new online experience?
<br><br>
My first experience with fantasy literature was reading Tolkien's The Hobbit. In it, a small, unassuming homebody finds himself thrown into experiences which would reduce most individuals to quivering heaps. By sheer luck, stamina, and desire, he wins his way to a dragon hoard and witnesses a battle of five separate armies, then finds his way home with his share of the dragon's riches. He has met powerful people and seen trolls turned to stone when struck by the dawning sun. When I put the book down, my mind filled with dragons and wizards, I tried to picture myself in that world. Would I have succeeded as Bilbo did? Would the first sight of a troll have paralyzed me with fear? The real world seemed a pale comparison to the rich world designed by Tolkien. Where could you find an elf in the middle of a city?
<br><br>
A few years later, a high school teacher of mine told me about a group of people that were playing a game which was just like the fantasy literature I was reading all the time. I walked into a room and found a group of elves, paladins, and dwarves battling a horde of orcs. I watched in awe as one mage cast a spell which put eight orcs to sleep. I had to join this band. I, too, wished to fight evil, gain treasure, and become the master of my weapon.
<br><br>
The lure of magic is a powerful one. Whether it is spell magic, where, with the flick of a finger one could knock over an ogre, or item magic, a sword which hums with power as it's blue-light gleam reflects in the terrified eyes of my foes, magic speaks to us of mystery and of ascendancy over our enemies. Admit it - you too have wondered what a suggestion spell in the right places might do for your grade point average.
<br><br>
My first character was a mage, Thormac. He wandered the makeshift dungeons of high-school game-masters, casting spells to help the party fight the weak monsters we encountered. When I got a wand of paralyzation, I almost killed the party by using it to the exclusion of group effect spells. I loved that wand, but when you are fighting 20 orcs, you should use a sleep spell. Thormac died at the hands of an ogre, his frail elven frame crushed by a 6 foot club, and I mourned the loss of a friend.
<br><br>
As our group became more powerful, we started to wander the wide world. Here, our risks were much greater, but so were the rewards. As a dwarven warrior, I fought giants with glee, tracking them to their lairs and dividing the gold suspiciously between the members of our group, for we had a thief, and she could not be trusted. The interplay between the characters and the players would get heated, especially when we were suddenly "missing" gems.
<br><br>
My dwarf warrior lusted after one item, a magic dwarven hammer. Imbued with arcane magic by dwarven smiths in ages past, in the hands of a dwarf it could be thrown and return to the wielder's hand. It could hit harder, and better, than any item my dwarf could imagine. When we ran across an ancient history text which told of a dwarven king who fell in battle against trolls in a far-away mountain range, we equipped ourselves to find if he really did wield the Hammer of the Dwarves. Questing, overcoming the dangers of the journey, and defeating the Troll King and his minions won my dwarf his hammer.
<br><br>
Our group began keeping track of our adventures, writing them down as they occurred, and our game sessions became a sort of group storytelling with rules and dice. After the game, we would boast of what we had done, praise each other for our efforts, revel in our victories, and commiserate in our defeats. Once we lost 5 out of 6 adventurers, and the surviving player returned to our dead bodies with a group of hired mercenaries and rescued us. That player overcame many obstacles to return his friends to the living world we inhabited, and for weeks we gave him respect due a hero.
<br><br>
It is moments like this we seek in our everyday world, but are hard to find. The challenges we overcome in the real world are mundane, ordinary. The quest to find a roll of toilet paper at midnight doesn't fire the imagination, does it? We feel we have no access to the great deeds of ages past, and so we turn to other ways to excel, to win respect, to see new things, and to gain experience.
<br><br>
The excitement and peril teach us about defeat, and grace under pressure. We have all lost characters, items of power, and dear friends because of battles lost. We have agonized over mistakes made, opportunities missed, and the price paid for our ignorance. Mustering the strength to go on, despite losses and mistakes, taught us how to use this in the real world, and overcome real life obstacles.
<br><br>
Advancing a character and becoming more powerful was fun, too. Adding new spells, abilities, being able to defeat tougher foes, these things also inspired my questing. Mastering the abilities of my class meant that I had less to fear in a battle, or quest, and I could strut about the town knowing that I could handle most things that happened.
<br><br>
More importantly, there is the escape. Entering an RPG world takes us away, for a while, from the troubles that life throws at us, and gives us energy to return. If you can survive a battle with three trolls and 15 orcs, you surely can survive a bad exam, a love lost, or a manipulative sibling. Even if things are going well, the lifting of daily reality and the presence of different puzzles can bring new perspectives.
<br><br>
I have learned over time that it is not the acquisition of items or the raising of statistics which fuels my love of role-playing. It is the process, the journey, the people I meet, the lessons I learn, and the tales I have to tell which keep me playing. I hope to tell the tale of our meeting outside a small tavern in Kaladim, or crossing the Plains of Karana.
<br><br>
20 years after Thormac, I am still seeking new adventures. The latest unexplored world is called Norrath, and I will explore and experience as much of it as I can. Everquest, with it's 3d interface and complex world with dwarves and shamans, dragons and frogloks, offers us a level of immersion which has yet to be experienced. We will be IN Norrath. Turning to the left will show us what is to our left. Looking at our hands will show us what we are carrying. Emotes are tied to actual movements, so a bow to a companion will be as real as a smile and a wave in real life. I pray that we take advantage of this opportunity to make Norrath a fun place to be. Be considerate of your fellow players, don't ruin their day with unprovoked assaults and insults. Add to, rather than subtract from, your fellow players' experience. Everquest - you're in OUR world now.
<br><br>
<I>I wrote this editorial for the EQVault last year about this time.  I was at the browsing screenshots/trying to upgrade my computer stage of getting ready for an attempt to make it into the beta-test. The impetus for the editorial came from my mental ramblings about if it was worth it, to me, to start spending a bunch of money just to <B>try</B> to get into the beta-test.  I asked myself, while looking at a shelf with over $800 worth of Role-Playing games, supplements, magazines and character sheets, if it had been worth it.
<br><br>
I have been playing EverQuest since phase 1, I got my CD in late July (see &quot;<A HREF="../Issue35/quest.htm">What the QUEST means in EverQuest</a>&quot;)  While my first login to EQ was rather spotty, I did eventually get in and started playing in a new world, consisting of a few zones around Qeynos at the time. I have played without too many breaks since then, all the way up until now, and have written over 80 stories, editorials and articles about my experiences, so I return to this article with a question:  <B>Is there role-playing romance in EverQuest?</B>  Has my love of role-playing been fulfilled?
<br><br>
I still feel a rush of excitement when I see my character login screen.  I know that I am about to embark on a new adventure, meet new people, and be part of a new tale to be told over IRC or in-game with my friends.  Does it happen all the time? No, not really.  It happens when I am willing to step outside the &quot;usual&quot;, when I take a risk with my character, or when I group up with adventuring buddies.
<br><br>
Adventure is about risk, really.  Would we have felt the same about Frodo’s throwing the One Ring in Mount Doom’s fires if he had hopped the bus, paid his fare, and sat in the back next to a hairy orc with a boom-box?  I think I’m learning, finally, that it’s the people I’m with and the feats we accomplish that make me excited about role-playing.  It’s not about thees and thous, and it’s not about the levels and items.  It’s about 3 half-elves running through South Karana, with less than 10 levels between them.  It’s about entering Crushbone, hearing someone scream &quot;Ambassador Dvinn is out!&quot; and being part of the group of hardy adventurers that slay him.  It’s about seeing a fellow warrior get dropped by a foe, with no cleric in sight, and frantically taunting that foe off his unconscious form, in the fierce hope that your friend was merely knocked out.  Finally, it’s about dying because you bit off more than you could chew, and fate was against you that day.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, in an online environment, sometimes it’s about your ISP dropping you in the middle of a fight, clogged server lines, frame rates that drop to 1 frame per 2 seconds (I have a p200), and server down times when you took the day off so you could get that one magic item.  While frustrating, at times <B>extremely</B> frustrating, it’s not too different from the time when your paper and pen group can’t get together for a few weeks because of lousy schedules.  I figure it’s better to just get away for a bit, than to stare at the screen getting angrier and angrier.  Find a Real Life adventure for a bit, maybe.
<br><br>
My weekly paper and pen role-playing group consists of 4 guys who don’t play EverQuest (gasp!). When we get together, I tell them of my weeks adventures, and the range of experiences available in this online game impresses them.  One has played it a little bit, and he enjoyed his brief time with it but can’t play due to motion sickness.  The main thing they think is a little disappointing is the repetitiveness of the game, often killing the same monsters over and over, which I usually do in my power-leveling moments.  I usually address that by hitting quests until I have either explored the quests that I can do until I can’t do them any longer, because of a mob I can’t take out, or a place I can’t get to, and I need to get help.
<br><br>
Yes, there is romance in EQ role-playing, but with it I have found a new tolerance and openness for other kinds of experiences.  I, like everyone, run across players who, when manners were getting handed out, thought they said banners and were sick of lam3 ‘n3t adz.  I’ve been trained and died, though not in a retaliatory way – yet.  I usually just get out of the area – there is just too much to do to have to stick around some idiot whose agenda includes ruining your playtime. My view of my EQ experience is a very positive one.  I still hope to be playing this game for a few years, and maybe, possibly, actually reaching 50<SUP>th</SUP> level as Oghma.  Say hello if you see me in game, and happy adventuring!

<br><br>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>I want to take a little time to thank all of those who have made past year of EverQuest experiences the fun (and occasionally agony) that it has been.  First of all, I want thank Christine, my fianc&eacute;e, whose endless patience and good humor has made writing and playing a joy and the exploration of new creative territory less terrifying.  Then, in no particular order, I’d like to thank: Absor, for his amazing dedication to this EverQuest weekly - Wynn for his outlook on life, intelligence, and his editing commentary - Ozymandius, for the creation of that astonishing organization of Guides, a feat which I still consider beyond human ability - Archanalia, for his explosive creativity and ability in so many things - Mike Hutchins, for his not-stop mocking and thoughtful insights into EverQuest and the gaming world – Winter, for her fax machine which accepts faxed chocolate, Elaan (Now Kindaan), Razor, Aklar and Nepenthia for bringing their talent to the staff, my adventuring buddy Kakur, who seems to be in a mind-meld with me in combat against EQ baddies - The folks in #ivytower; Amoroth, Dach, Zasstryn, Beldro, Danubus, Aeriana, Keldin, Ian Ash (especially Ian) and Keafa.  Of course, Brad McQuaid and Bill Trost for the creation and direction of this incredible environment we play in. I’d like to thank the players I meet in-game, especially those who give me long quizzes to determine that yes, indeed, I am *<B>that*</B> Oghma.
<br><br>
&#9;Most of all, I’d like to thank all the readers who respond to my editorials and writings with encouragement, criticisms, and thoughtful insights, and those readers who just read and enjoy.  I don’t think I could have ever done this if I hadn’t had <B>your</B> help.
