<center><big><b>The Paladin</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
	Paladins capture our imagination for many reasons.  The idea of a selfless hero, a champion of the downtrodden, a holy warrior using his/her martial gifts to overcome evil, and protect the weak is an icon which brings us hope and inspires courage.  Where did this ideal warrior come from?  The paladin is not a typical hero, because there is an added element of selflessness and piety that a Conan or Odysseus does not have.  The paladin is above all a hero above reproach, whose dedication to lofty ideals places him/her beyond the reach of the typical hero.

<font size="-1">
Sometimes, without much warning, a storm will brood and form its sifting self above the ocean, then sweep inland and loose its load upon unsuspecting travellers.  Sometimes, the storms and weak, and hold little danger in their watery bodies.  Sometimes, they are strong, and force creatures of the land to hide, and wait for the sun's return.  Sometimes, they are magical.

<center><big><b>A Long Rant on Online Role Playing</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
Role Playing meets the high tech computer game industry. Can the relationship work?
<br><br>
It works in text based MUDs. That feeling. You are in a social environment with friends and making new ones, as well as meeting people you might never see again, every day. It is often busier than a major city mall. People like to hang out and do nothing some times, while others are goal oriented. The setting is perfect for role playing.

Trynlor landed quietly on the rooftop. He was up and running the moment his feet touched the roof. He ran to the edge of the building and leapt onto the roof of the neighboring building, his thick black cloak fluttered behind him as he flew threw the air. It was long past midnight, and those that were out were either guards or drunks who couldn't find their way back to their homes. Trynlor paid little attention to any of them. He was on a mission, 4,000 platinum were riding on Trynlor's success tonight<b>...</b>

If Taedar can tell his tale, then I should do no less ;)
<br><br>
As the first citizen of Norrath, my path has been filled with wonder and
excitement, peril and terror, passion and pain.  I have walked every step of
the lands, standing upon the very edge of reality and watch it unraveled
before me as new lands emerge.  And each new land, each new beast, each new
experience fills my heart anew.

Hi, I'm Archanalia the Roleplayer.  You may know me from such characters as "Mizzrak the Maloderous Troll" and "Qestrin, assassin of souls".
<br><br>
While Archanalia may be well known for his inability to resist a sick joke and his casual demeanor, Mizzrak and Pun-Chi are less amiable.  But then you wouldn't know this unless you could connect all three together and could see that I am, in fact, NONE of these three.  That's right; none of these characters, good or bad, are in fact like me.  Now THAT's Roleplaying!

<font size="-1">
My question to the EQ community is why does a good thing have to be tainted by a few bad people? You may wonder why I am asking this when we are all not in the game playing it together just yet, but I have a very good reason. Some beta tester chose to break his or her NDA and post the beta manual. This not only angers me, but makes me wonder if the good people will outweigh the bad.

Morality and the Internet.
<br><br>
Two words that won't work well together.  Not that they can't, they just won't.  This week I've been barraged with examples.  Fox replayed their segment about stings made on Internet child pornographers.  Not only are these guys selling child pornography to anyone with money, they are also stalking new 'models' over the Internet.  These guys were actually driving hundreds of miles to meet with these children.  I can't even get into how disgusting that is<b>...</b>

<em>Thank you for EQX! I read it religiously and am never disappointed with contributions of your many columnists. I do, however, have a request. I often notice your columnists mention their experience with MUDs. To date I have never seen them mention any MUDs by name nor have they thrown a URL our way......I for one would like to try some of these MUDs but dont know where to go....how about a column on MUDs in general and some recommendations as to what Muds are fun to play.
<br><br>
Thanks,<br>
