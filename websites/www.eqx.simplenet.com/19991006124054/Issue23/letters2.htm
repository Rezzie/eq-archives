I always award experience for a job well done by players who stick
closely to their character concepts and/or class restrictions. I never
take away experience for roleplaying flubs though but merely bring about
in game consequences to remind them that if their character is going to
change drastically, that he/she will have a lot of things to adjust to.
<br><br>
Now how would a computer take over this job?  I fear that all the
passion you have invested into finding the "Big Secret" is for naught.
I think we will all be long dead before a computer algorithm is created
that can make more than basic judgments about how a player is
roleplaying and match that to a pre-entered character concept.

To me, what this says is that for a CRPG to actually be an RPG is going
to take a little more commitment from players than your average computer
game.  The players will be called upon to judge themselves and how well
they are roleplaying.  Sure, perhaps there will be in-game GMs that can
somewhat assist with this, but there will never be enough to provide the
direction that a GM in a pen and paper game sitting directly in front of
five or so players can provide.

So if online CRPGs are to survive; people will have to be at least a
somewhat decent judge of roleplaying.  Its up to the players to monitor
themselves and actually WANT to participate in the online virtual
world.  For a CRPG to be an actual roleplaying game, its completely in
the players hands.

<em>[Ed: I just wanted to note that I am in complete agreement with Russell.
His points are valid, and his conclusion is very important.  I hope we can
all take it to heart.]</em>
