<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
I am a High Elven woman with... well... feelings... feelings for other women... Everywhere I look I see beauty, but I am not noticing the correct sex... Nay, not even the right race! Predominantly I am attracted to wood elf women, however I dare not bring to light my forbidden feelings, not only for fear of rejection but of the disgrace I would bring about on my families name. Please help, I fear my feelings shall soon tear me apart if my dagger does not do it first.

Well firsted o all, make sure when ya's usin yer dagger dat ya's always thrust forward from right in front o yer body, not sideways.  Have yer grip on da handle wiff a frim grasp.  Dis way ya's won't glance a blow and maybe have it comes back at ya's.  On da other problem.
<br><br>
Ya know once me family had two sled Doggie Woof-woofs named Drift and well I ferget da other's name.  Any how, they both were she Doggie woof-woofs, but Drift would sometimes act like a he Doggie Woof-woof wiff da other one.  Did da barbs all stand round worry bout findin Drift a he sled doggie she liked?  Heck no!  When ya's gots more dan 14 polars ta skin, are knee in da icky process, it's below... well it's friggen cold out, and yer not allowed ta go ta bed near da fire afore ya's finish, no one cares what da Drift is doin and who's she a hurtin?  Let lone take'n time outta da hunt fer food and furs jist ta walkin her round so she can sniff tails wiff another clan's doggies.  I thinky iffen yer family gots enough time layin round ta be worry'n bout dis stuff, send em on up ta Halas fer a bit.  Dat's da problem wiff Norrath Glamcrist, to many dunt gots enough polar bears ta clean.

<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
I am Vast,  the Bard o` song and dance.With mind of webbing, need advice alliance.
<br><br>
I read as ye write, to warriors abroad And shows me a wisdom, yet to be flawed.
<br><br>
Daily I see creatures, with skin soft as air.I wonder how Erollisi, ever made one so fair.
<br><br>
Which is the one? Lips tremble to my own With passions for me, love deeper than bone
<br><br>
How do I know? Who is wrong?  Who is right? Oxesiess of tribe, can  you help me this night?

<br><br>
I's da Oxes<br>
When I's sing and dance<br>
I's trample and knockes
<br><br>
Round and round I's prance<br>
And sticky thingys wiff a lance
<br><br>
Den I put da parts when deaded in boxes.
<br><br>
Da End

<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
 I am a Dark Elf necromancer and i have been killing orcs since level 8, i am now level 13 when i first traveled to East Commons, some of the guards con dubiously to me but then thier are the inkeeper's who con a hateful threateningly to me. Will i ever be able to go through Freeport unscathed?, if not what do i do when i see Gathering shadows is fadeing and im in the middle of Freeport?

<br><br><b>
Iffen ya's can git through Freeport unscathed I's thinky yer doing better than most of us.  Jist be'n in da heat down der gives me a headache.  Let alone seemed like me patch work, back when I's a Barb-cub, would come alive wiff lil witty bitty black jumping thingys dat bit.  Not ta metion Freeport is a UuuuugggggLY!  I's really dunno what's worse lookin at all da junk and broken thingys or da sand gettin in da Hard-ta-Reach amror joints.
<br><br>
Now iffen I was ya's, and yer really determined ta try dis outta all o da places of Norrath,  Freeport!, I'd find a sneaky.  Ayeps I's can assure ya's that some parts o da Freeport are so sandy and so broken down dat not even da peoples who live der wanna go near.
