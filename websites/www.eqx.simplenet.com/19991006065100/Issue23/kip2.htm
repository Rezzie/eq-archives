"Gentlemen," the apothecary soothed, "perhaps kings court is not the best game to be
playing for us. Shall we try our hand at something slightly less challenging?" He
asked the warriors. 
<br><br>
Goareke the Warrior champion had not traveled with the priest for long, and was
growing thin with his parental tone, and narrowed his eyes. "Deal." he barked at
Kip. He looked at his hand in turn and then started to complain again. "Why did we
bring this cloth along anyway Emerson?" he asked of the warrior across the table,
slandering the apothecary of Bristlebane as a bed nurse.

The older of the warriors replied "We would not want to be without him once we cross
snakes pass, for it is chumped full of walking dead." Emerson looked over his hand
and placed a few copper forward. "We were told before that we would have a lady cloth
with us though, I don’t know why Ramius would have set us up with this guy we haven’t
worked with before," he looked to the apothecary and lowered his head in apology.

The other three adventurers put down their hands in frustration, looking as if to get
up and leave, but they did not. Goareke looked to the apothecary, then to the other
warrior and slid forward all of his copper, and one silver. He chuckled to himself as
his companion looked cross.
<br><br>
"You don’t make that kind of wage, kid." Emerson said, sliding forward the same
amount, then they both looked to the apothecary. "Call it, cloth" he sneered. He did,
and Goareke clearly had the better hand.
