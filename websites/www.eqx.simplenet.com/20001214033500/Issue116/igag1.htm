First off, I need ta introduce meself.  My name is Igag Brabyknurd.  Da ting most people do is pronounce me name like I gag.  but it is more Ig Ag.  just ta get that handled off da bat so der no problems down da road so ta speak.  
<br><br>
I will be reviewing all da bars and other places around norrath dat da people likes ta go to.  Highlighting things of interest that people like ta see and da colorful people around these parts that you may not have met.
<br><br>
For my first article I gunna start in Halas wif me first place I ever did go and drink da ale. McQuaid's Dark Stout.  Run by Donald McQuaid and his wife Brin, this is a fine establishment dat been in business since before me pops was a cub.  Wif a fairly decent assortment of booze, dey can handle most of your drinking needs as well as a place ta do it.  With a capacity of 6 to 10 people this is a nice place for intimate gatherings where you don't want a lot of hoopla and rigimaroll.   Relaxing atmosphere with a hint of homeyness with the locals being around time to time.  Without any entertainment or food, McQuaid's is a place for the drinker that wants a drink.
<br><br>
Da only competition in Halas is McDaniels Smokes and Spirits.  But it caters to the larger groups with much more space.  So if you are in the Halas area, stop in to McQuaid's and tell em you heard about em from Igag and EQX.  
<br><br>
Igag rating:  3 burps
<br><br>
Next review…  well, you will just have to wait and see cause I dunno where I'll be after a night at McQuaids.
