	<big><big>R</big></big>eligion is a sticky subject in RPG’s.  With any game which allows a class which uses holy powers, that power needs a source.  Whether that class is a typical AD&D cleric, druid, shaman, or a mystic will change what sort of theistic system that game will use.  Since the religious system in a game will set the mythic "stage" for gameplay, throwing in a new class suddenly becomes a potentially world altering event.  Polytheistic systems can more easily accommodate change, which is why so many fantasy worlds have them. How do characters view the gods, as opposed to players?  How does it affect role-playing?

One of the first things that struck me with role-playing games which have a polytheistic system is that the characters should have absolute belief in the existence of gods.  In most fantasy worlds, there is no doubt at all that the gods exist, because there is proof positive of their existence.  Actual heroes have had conversations with these entities.  Ordinary individuals may have seen them.  There is no requirement of faith to believe in the existence of gods, but there is a requirement of faith to believe that individuals can sway the gods in their favor.  The creation of ritual, sacrifice and efforts at appeasement are the direct result of that faith.  What does this mean for the role-player?

If you play a cleric, you seek to obtain power from your specific deity.  In a polytheistic system, that means that you have to do things to attract favorable attention to yourself, while avoiding getting negative attention.  The worshippers before you probably have created a way to do that already, and you would subscribe to their practices.  There is your biggest role-playing hook., and the beginning of your work!
<br><br>
Since you don’t really know what previous worshippers have done, you must create your own rituals and codes of behavior. Hopefully you have other clerics of the same god to interact with, so you can collaborate.  If you don’t agree, you can create a schism which divides the church into sects and burn heretics and have a merry old time.  It’s only human/elf/dwarf/ orc/whatever :).
