Hello again.

Sorry that EQX went up late this week.  We had some unforeseen problems, and
the editor had some other obligations this weekend.
<br><br>
Recently, from what I hear, Chaosium decided to reclaim their world
(Glorantha) from the clutches of Avalon Hill, to whom they sold the game
several years ago.  It's a pretty convoluted situation, but from what I
understand Avalon Hill has rights to the game system (the Universal
Roleplaying System, arguably one of the best ever created), but Chaosium
still has rights to the game world and history of Glorantha (also arguably
one of the best ever created).  I am also quite certain that the world of
Glorantha was a beloved thing by its creator, Greg Stafford.  Now he, and
his company, Chaosium, are creating "Hero Wars", the Glorantha RPG.  There
was a convention locally last weekend where they showed off the new game
system that was to accompany the old game universe.  Our GM was there…
<br><br>
And he said, to paraphrase, that the new system sucked.  Now usually I take
this with a grain of salt, after all, he hates everything.  He's never liked
a movie, never loved a book.  So a remake of his favorite world and his
favorite game system could never make high marks.  But we talked about it a
bit, and it seems he is right.  They tried to create a system that did not
intrude on the story telling aspect of the game (what White Wolf did so
successfully).  But they took it too far.  They went beyond an easy to use
system all the way to a nearly non-existent system (what someone did with the
Amber Diceless Game).  No matter how simple the system, there needs to be
some depth to the rules, some clear method to proceed from action A to result
B.  They seem to have failed to do that.
<br><br>
By now you are wondering, as I suspect you usually do a few paragraphs into
these editorials, what this has to do with EverQuest.  Not much,
unfortunately.  Except that there are two factors that make any game, the
system and the world.  This applies to EverQuest as much as to Glorantha.
<br><br>
In EverQuest we will be given a world with history.  We will be able to draw
upon that history to create our characters and to help us find our way in the
world.  If that game world is half as complex and well thought out as
Glorantha (though I admit that Glorantha has been built over a dozen or more
years, Norrath won't have that luxury) then I will be ecstatic.  I would
encourage the designers to open the creation of the history of Norrath to
interested and talented folks on the net and expand it as much as possible
before the release of the final.  An in depth world history can encourage
folks that want to role-play, and inspire those that have never done it
before.  What always inspired me about the Gloranthan mythology was the
stories about individual heroes.  Small details of the worlds history that
rarely, if ever, have any bearing on the current game, but always give you
some insight into the ways of the world and how and why things happen.  While
I have been very firm about not posting URLs in EQX, I want to encourage all
you role-players (and Sony design staff) to check out the world of
<a href=http://www.glorantha.com/new/index.html>Glorantha</a>.  You'll not
find a more original and complete game world anywhere.
<br><br>
But the sticky part here is the system.  What character statistics matter for
what kind of actions (or what statistics are there in the first place)?  What
types of characters exist (will there be classes like D&D and EQ, or a
classless system like UO and the old Glorantha)?  How does a character gain
in power (levels or a skill increases as it's used)?  Stuff like that.  The
old system used for RuneQuest (Glorantha before it was sold to Avalon Hill)
was very much like UO in its system.  There were no "classes".  Each
character could learn nearly any skill or magic.  EQ will be more like D&D.
A level system.  I like the system used by RuneQuest better than D&D.  But I
like the D&D model better for an on-line game like EQ.
<br><br>
Hmmm…  too many acronyms in that last paragraph.  I suspect I lost some of
you in there.  It boils down a few simple things.  A careful examination of
the mechanics of the game system is important.  A level based system will
work best in an on-line world because, while harder to balance, it is easier
to create a diverse world where all the characters are different and they
work together to get things done.  On-line there is no GM to say, "No, Bob,
you can not be a fighter/mage, we already have 5 in the party…"
<br><br>
Anyway, check out Glorantha.  And when Hero Wars comes out, check to see if
they have adopted the rules system that we are creating for them, even thought
they don't know it yet...
