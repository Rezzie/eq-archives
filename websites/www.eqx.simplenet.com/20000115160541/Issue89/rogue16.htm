    "Brother?" asked Katha, sitting upright on the bed.  "What do you mean, her brother?"    Daryth gave Kinory a sidelong glance.  
<br><br>
    "You didn't tell her?" 
<br><br>
    "Tell me what?"  Katha turned to Kinory.  Her usually lazy regard had gone steely.  "Who's your brother, Kinory?"
<br><br>
    Kinory averted her eyes and scuffed at the floor with one worn boot-toe.  
<br><br>
    "Remember that Guard, the one who was waiting in Bayle's bed?"
<br><br>
    "You're related to a Guardsman?"   Katha leaped to her feet.  "My gods, and you never thought it worthy of mentioning?  And you!  You knew about this?"  She wheeled to face Daryth.
<br><br>
    "Calm down, Katha," he began.
<br><br>
    "I thought he was dead," snapped Kinory.  "And I did not see what difference it made.  Do you think telling you when we met at the Guildhouse would have been a good idea?  You were ready to take my head as it was.  Besides, it doesn't matter.  He is my brother no more.  I've changed, and so has he."  Kinory had to scrub at suddenly burning eyes.  Daryth watched her with compassion.  Katha snorted.
<br><br>
   "Family is not so easily discarded as all that."  She caught a look from Daryth and threw up her hands.  "Alright!  Alright, perhaps I would have done no different in your position.  Gods know, we all have pasts that we would like to leave behind.  Yours seems to be following you, though, Kinny.  Whether you like it or no, you are tied to him."
<br><br>
   "I do not want to be!" Kinory shoved violently away from the door and stalked to the window.  The tops of the trees tossed in the wind.    The moonlight fell on the road, turning it into a pale ribbon that stretched away across the hills.  Her eyes followed it until it disappeared into the distance.  She had avoided thinking about Gwyn on the way here, but now, she had to wonder if he had made it out of Freeport alive.  
<br><br>
    "Life is rarely what we want, my lady Kinory," said Daryth behind her.  "Denying things does not make them go away."
<br><br>
    "I know," she whispered, leaning her forehead against the cool glass.  "I don't have to like it, though."  She closed her eyes, and as she did so, the glass shattered beside her face.  A dark blur sped across the room, and with a thump, a crossbow quarrel was quivering in the wall next to the door.  Kinory didn't have time to jerk away before Daryth bore her to the ground.  Katha darted out the door, moving with her customary feline grace and speed.  Daryth raised his head marginally, peering out of the window.
<br><br>
   "Damn!" he hissed, and then reached up and snuffed the lantern.  Kinory raised a trembling hand to her cheek.  Her fingers came away wet with a dark liquid that glistened in the moonlight.  Daryth swore again, more softly, and pushed her hand away.  He examined the cut, plucked a shard of glass from her flesh and then grinned reassuringly at her.
<br><br>
   "It'll make a most impressive scar, but you will live."  Kinory tried to stand, and he pushed her to the floor.  "Stay."  He pointed a finger at her, and she subsided sulkily.  He went to the door, and crouched beside it.  They waited for a count of ten or so, and then a sharp, truncated cry came from outside the window.  Kinory started up, but Daryth motioned her down once more.  There was a soft almost-sound, and then Katha slid through the shattered window.  
<br><br>
   "Only one," she said.  "And very badly prepared." She grimaced. "We must have been followed from Freeport.  He was Militia."
<br><br>
   "<em>Militia</em> followed you?" said Daryth, incredulous.  "<em>I</em> could not follow you, Katha, if you did not want to be followed.  Not through the underground."
<br><br>
   "He must have had help," said Katha testily, and strode to the quarrel.  She wrenched it out of the wall and delicately sniffed the point.  She reared her head back instantly, and handed it to Daryth.  "Careful with that."
<br><br>
   "Essence of agaly," he said, nostrils flaring.  She nodded grimly.
<br><br>
   "Galern's trademark," said Kinory, rising from the floor.  "I guess Somhan wasn't too upset with Galern for spoiling the assassination."
<br><br>
    "We have to move," said Katha.  "I don't know if this one had partners, but I suspect that he would not have risked a direct attack unless the news of our whereabouts was already on its way back to Somhan.  Or Galern, or whoever is the mastermind for all this."
<br><br>
   "Somehow, I don't think it's either of them.   Galern is ambitious enough, but he had no interest in seeing Bayle dead.  It was merely an opportunity for him.  And Somhan is just not smart enough."  Daryth shook his head.  "Well, there's no time for speculation now.  Get your things."
<br><br>
   "But if he was the only one out there, why do we have to go now?"  Abused muscles all over Kinory's body cried out at the thought of getting back on that horse.
<br><br>
   "When someone wants you dead, Kin, you don't stay where they can find you."  Katha grinned maliciously and tossed her saddlebags at her.  Kinory caught them and, sighing, followed Daryth out of the room.
