					<div class="subtitles"><h2>1. What is a web site?</h2></div>

					<p>A Web site is a collection of files that includes a main file called a home page or index page. Typically, you will, as a person or company, tell someone how to get to your web site by providing your home page address. For example, <span class="bold_font">http://www.simplenet.com</span> is the home page for the SimpleNet web site. From the home page, you can get to all the other pages on the site. A web site may include text, graphics, audio and video files, and hyperlinks to other web pages.</p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2>2. Is shared web site hosting the solution for me?</h2></div>

					<p> Shared web site hosting is much like living in an apartment versus a
					  house. An apartment provides a living space that is cost-effective,
					  low-maintenance and secure. Where as, a home provides one
					  with larger space, but also larger payments, insurance,
					  risk, and care costs. An apartment building contains several
					  units under one roof. Shared hosting is the same. Several web sites are
					  stored on a powerful, professionally managed server, at a low monthly
					  cost.</p>

					<p>Shared web site hosting is the perfect place for beginners and for those who are experienced in web design, but do not need the added responsibilities of a dedicated server.</p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2>3. Where is the facility my website will be hosted in?</h2></div>

					<p> Our Access Center is a world-class facility and was the first of its kind in San Diego, California. Completed in March 1998, our 2,000 square foot, 150 rack Access Center meets the high security and protection demands of any Internet presence. The Access Center has fire suppression and redundant systems for connectivity, electrical power, and air conditioning.</p>

					<p>We monitor our Access Center 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and 365 days per year. Our staff is committed and trained to provide you with continual, high-level network monitoring and load management of your connection. In addition, we offer engineering support for outage response, network performance analysis, and network planning.</p>

					<p>The Access Center features fault tolerant power utilizing a redundant APC Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system with 160 KVA total capacity. The UPS will provide power until our 450kW diesel generator starts up and carries the electrical load. Our generator can run indefinitely as our 250 gallon fuel tank is re-fueled from the street. Each rack has its own dedicated circuit that is "conditioned" by the UPS before powering any equipment.</p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2>4. What kind of technical support is offered?</h2></div>

					<p>Technical support is offered primarily by email although telephone support
				    is available. Email and phone support is offered 24 hours/day,
					  365 days a year.</p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2>5. Why is the SimpleNet shared hosting architecture superior?</h2></div>

					<p>Our revolutionary hosting architecture is the latest step to, once again, exceed the standards and expectations of the industry. Architecture is the difference between a web hosting provider that does everything to help their clients be successful and those who merely throw up a page and announce that they are a web host. Learn about our shared hosting architecture below. Our solution incorporates each of the following critical components.</p>

					<p><span class="bold_font">Firewall:</span><br>
					A firewall is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to your web site. A firewall examines each network packet to determine whether to allow it to reach its requested destination or prohibit it and report it for further analysis.</p>

					<p><span class="bold_font">Load-Balancing:</span><br>
					Load balancing is dividing the amount of work that a server has to do between multiple servers so that more work gets done in the same amount of time and, in general, all web sites requests get served faster. The load balancers stay in constant contact with the servers to determine how busy they are and/or if one of them has failed.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Continuously checks status of web servers</li>
						<li>Determines best server for a web site request</li>
						<li>Provides multi-server redundancy to prevent critical failures</li>
						<li>Automatically takes a troubled server offline and sends an alert</li>
					</ul>

					<p><span class="bold_font">SimpleNet Servers:</span><br>
					A server is the hardware/software combination that serves requested web pages, files or other information. Servers answer requests from web browsers to provide information from web sites, email and databases. Then, sends that information to the requesting browser.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Multiple server clustering ensures against individual system failure</li>
						<li>Excess servers provide for burst capacity (excess requests)</li>
						<li>Distributes requests across multiple servers to maximize performance</li>
						<li>Servers are internally redundant and tuned for optimal performance</li>
					</ul>

					<p><span class="bold_font">File Storage:</span><br>
					SimpleNet uses Network Appliance&reg; storage solutions with multiple auto-fail over and hot-swappable drives to ensure continuous delivery of your web content.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Drives are continuously tested for performance and reliability</li>
						<li>Each unit has redundant power supplies</li>
						<li>Faulty drives are automatically removed, replaced and reported</li>
					</ul>
