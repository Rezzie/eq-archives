When playing EverQuest we are often confronted with situations that require some understanding of the etiquette of the game, and of the Internet in general.  What I often take as a given, like inkies <b>will</b> hassle my Half-Elf bard at any opportunity and that training giants on people is wrong, some players don't understand at all.  Some of the basic, often unspoken, rules of etiquette of EverQuest might be too unspoken for some players.
<br><br>
This was made clear to me when I had a full frontal impact with a Halfling this week.  I was reluctant to tell this tale here.  Not because it's not funny.  And I think it might be instructional.  But I am reluctant to start telling tales about what happens to Absor in game.  If I start doing that I may very well end up with people trying to piss me off so that they can hear me complain about it on EQX.  Or, better yet, have people try to make me happy in the hope that I will praise them in an editorial or arrticle.  In the past I've stuck with tales from characters that nobody knew.  But this one was just too good to let pass.
<br><br>
This story was funny when it happened, though I'm not sure how it will read.  I've paraphrased what was said.  Don't worry, I have been duly chastised for not taking screenshots.  And my apologies to those of you that may have already heard this story on a certain newsgroup...
<br><br>
I suppose there might be some small spoiler info if you're not familiar with Lavastorm, so keep that in mind.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
After ridding himself of his dead-weight hunting partner Talryk, Absor <b>finally</b> purchases his first combine blade.  He spends some time getting revenge on the elementals that have chased him out of Lavastorm so many times.  The feeling of power goes to his head, and he decides to go in and see what all the fuss was about in the place with the really big doors.
<br><br>
He meets a few people, and is generally pleased and a bit surprised at the friendliness of the dark ones in the area.  He discovers that inside there are a few skeletons (really BIG skeletons) strewn about.  These things ignore the other adventurers as they run past, but do their best to beat Absor to a pulp.  He defeats a few, then decides that it might be wiser to retreat, considering that the refuse is in this place is dangerous enough for him that meeting the real denizens could mean a quick and, as always, unpleasant death.
<br><br>
He spends a few minutes outside, resting from his adventure into the darkness.  There are four or five people resting nearby as well, most are High Elves.  This strikes him as odd, but isn't relevant to the tale.  A little one, a Halfling, comes running into the tunnel with two elementals chasing him.  Flawlessly, like a well-honed team, all of us in the tunnel arise and lay into the beasts, even the Teir'dal.  Then we hear, piping up among all the spell casting and the sounds of combat, a little voice, obviously the one that we were trying to save.
<br><br>
"Why are you *&*@& stealing my kills!"
<br><br>
Most of us stop a moment in shock, Absor certainly did.  He ignores the elemental that seems to desire his death so intently (poor thing wasn't up to the task, and killing it wasn't as important as discovering why the Halfling was so upset).  Absor tells the new arrival, "We were trying to help."
<br><br>
"Why don't you *^$%*^$ wait until I ASK for help!"
<br><br>
Now, having just recently failed to an attempt to save a lovely young High Elf maiden (who had saved Absor twice already that day) from death at the hands of a nasty imp, Absor was a bit shocked.  And, I'll admit, a bit angry.
<br><br>
"Don't worry, it won't happen again.  You'll never receive help from me in the future."
<br><br>
"Well you can take your help and shove it"
<br><br>

<br><br>
Absor is now a bit angrier.  He had expected to be treated poorly by the dark ones, not by a Halfling!
<br><br>
"Look, if you want to hunt elementals, we're not going to stop you.  But don't bring them in here."  <em>Here</em> was the entrance tunnel to a dungeon, a common resting spot.
<br><br>
"Why shouldn't I bring them in here?  It's not your tunnel! %&$*#!"
<br><br>
"Because if they kill you, or you run away, then we have to deal with them."
<br><br>
A few more rude gestures and curses later, and the little fella runs off.  Normally Absor would also have left, not wanting to further aggravate the situation.  But he/we felt stubborn that night, and remained to see what would happen next.  Sure enough, the Halfling returns with two more elementals in tow.
<br><br>
Now I should point out that the little guy was a Druid, and I could tell by the way he handled himself that he wasn't quite as experienced as I (two levels lower, in fact).  And either of these new elementals on their own would be a challenge for me.  So I knew he was in trouble.  Everyone else simply left the area.  And Absor should have as well.  But morbid curiosity ruled him that night, and he watched.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Yup, he sure was in trouble.  So he fled into the nasty place, the place where the 'hall trash' was teaching Absor lessons in combat, leaving Absor alone with these two, now very angry, elementals.  I decided to flee as well.  So I followed the little one.
<br><br>
After the usual moment of disorientation that always seems to follow such a transition, I arrived upon a scene that made my whole night.
<br><br>
A mist elemental hits Halfling for 38<br>
A mist elemental hits Halfling for 22<br>
An earth elemental hits Halfling for 24
<br><br>
Short pause, soft thudding sound.
<br><br>
An earth elemental tries to hit you but misses<br>
A mist elemental hits you for 22
<br><br>
Absor stayed just long enough to shake his head over the corpse of the little man.  But he shed not a tear.
<br><br>
And to make the whole night just a tad bit better, Absor spent another hour in the area, meeting a few people, having a shouting contest with a powerful Tier'dal named Nuuin.  It seems that even in the darkness they have heard of the Shouting Bard.  Absor also finally killed one of them piles of rock that scared him so terribly with all their grinding and bashing.   His confidence again raised, he returned to the place with the big door, just to see if he could delve more deeply into the darkness.
<br><br>
Realizing rather quickly that he could not overcome his deep-seated fears, he retreated to rest.  And there, pillaging his own tiny corpse, was the Halfling.  Neither of us said a word.  I can only hope that he could feel the smugness that I was trying to exude.
<br><br>
I'm pleased that I was able to come away from that whole encounter so amused.  A lot of times such a nasty person will sour the game for those around them, and everyone will come away unhappy.
<br><br>
I'll not turn this into a lecture about being nice to your fellow EverQuest players.  I shouldn't have to do that.  Instead I want to touch on some of the subtle and unspoken rules of EverQuest.

<OL>

<LI>If you are resting at a zone border you should be aware that someone is likely to come through with some very angry and often powerful beastie chasing them.  And it they do escape, they'll leave that nasty thing behind.  So sitting where I was I had no expectation of safety and I was alert to potential danger, as were the rest of the folks there.  Keep that in mind if you chose to rest in the relative safety of a zone border, and don't you dare get angry at anyone for using that same safety to ditch a nasty enemy.</LI>
<br><br>
<LI>If you come running to a zone line with something chasing you, you will always look like you are in need of help.  If you look like you're running for your life, don't get angry with someone for helping you.  That's just silly.  Sure, my Tier'dal might yell at a Human for interfering, but I'll always make sure that the player understands that I'm in character, and that as a person I'm grateful for the help.</LI>
<br><br>
<LI>If you are 'pulling' a monster, don't pull it to a zone line, especially one that you know will be filled with people resting or chatting.  I know, I know, there are a lot of people that make a living in EverQuest doing just that.  They feel safer fighting only a few steps away from escape.  Well, be polite.  If you want to pull, pull them near to the zone, but not right into it.  This way you can still escape with little risk, and you reduce the risk to others.  It also allows others a chance to see you fighting and move if they think you might not be victorious.</LI>
<br><br>
<LI>If you are running to escape something unpleasant, and that unpleasant thing is dangerous to others, then make use of your num-lock key (auto run) and your /shout command.  Warn people that you're coming.  Now I know this is probably out of character for some.  A dark elf may have no problem running a giant into a pack of resting animals (Humans, Elves…).  But remember, this is more than just a game, it's a social gathering.  So warn them.  If it's out of character, then use /ooc to warn them.  And do me a favor, stop using the term 'train' in shout.  It's out of character, sloppy and getting on my nerves…</LI></OL>

I've only covered the rules that I know of that regard the situation I described.  There are probably dozens of other unwritten rules that apply to other situations.  And, likely, some of you think that I've got the rules that I did list wrong.
<br><br>
So how about this.  Send me any other rules of etiquette that you think apply to EverQuest.  Send me corrections to my list.  When I think we've got it all covered, I'll write up another article and include them.
