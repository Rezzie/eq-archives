Drudge Sited in Rivervale! 
<br><br>
Around 8:15 AM this morning, Rivervale officials reported seeing a small Gnomish individual fitting  the description of the notorious Rogue from Ak'Anon known simply as Drudge, passing through  this land of the Halflings. 
<br><br>
Drudge, a devoted follower of Brisbane (The Prince of Thieves) has been sought after by Norrath  officials for months for allegedly stealing from the local inhabitants. This 3 foot tall menace has been  able to elude apprehension by apparently using his acute ability to Hide from and Sneak by his  would-be assailants. 
<br><br>
While thieves are quite common around the lands of Norrath, Drudge gained notoriety by announcing that he, in conjunction with one of his fellow thugs, Sorcer, a Wood Elf Bard, would attempt to  pull off a fly-by looting of one of the most feared monstrosities Norrath has to offer... The Hill Giants of the Commonlands. 
<br><br>
Their apparent delusional theory is that while Sorcer pulses speed into the small body of the Gnomish vigilante, Drudge will be able to fly by the above mentioned Hill Giant, and attempt to Pick Pocket  this enormous entity. 
<br><br>
While Hill Giants are without a doubt, far more powerful then anything these pirates have ever encountered, one must wonder what treasures they will bring back if successful. You might remember last month, when Drudge and company successfully stole Ambassador DVinn's Black Heart from  his still beating chest. A  feat that shocked many... Including the Ambassador, who was unavailable for comment at the time of this printing. 
<br><br>
In follow-up to this siting, I traveled to Rivervale to speak with some of the local inhabitants. Upon arrival,  I noticed that the Bank door was still sealed until officials could verify that nothing had been stolen from the  town treasury. Strangely enough, after talking with several individuals, I was surprised to find that nobody,  including the town treasury, had any items to report as "Missing". 
<br><br>
Somewhat confused, I said my good-byes to this land of the little people,  and begin making my way back        to Qeynos, when out from the distance, I could  hear a high pitch, almost screeching shout...  It was Nillipuss shouting, "Hey!!!! Has anybody seen my JumJum?!?!"

The Freeport Militia has cleaned house in Freeport West. At least twenty
lie dead. Most likely they got word of a spy and instead of searching
for him they decided to kill all travelers.  Or perhaps it was Sir Lucan
just showing the force of his Militia. Some even speculate that something got
into their ale at the Grub N Grog(the local guard tavern). Whatever it
was... it's over. Maybe we should listen to the Knights of Truth and fear
the Militia. Who knows?
