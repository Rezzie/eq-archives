(It occurred to me one day while reading the names of all the Tanarus players who had
joined the Avault newsgroup Forum.Everquest that some of the problems of the first SISA
game, Tanarus, would actually come across completely differently in EverQuest)

"Absor, help!"
<br><br>
Absor stepped to the edge of the room, unwilling to cross the threshold until he knew
what had happened to Archanalia.  He was there one second, then he bumped into that
Dwarf and vanished.  The Dwarf simply walked away.
<br><br>
"Absor!… Up Here!!"

Absor cast his eyes toward the ceiling.  There was Archanalia, inexplicably stuck in
place, part of his hip stuck through the surface of the roof, as if the two had merged.
<br><br>
"By the Gods…" he muttered, stunned at the strange sight, "I’ll get you down… somehow."
<br><br>
As Absor turned toward the provision packs to get a rope he noticed them coming
toward him; Two Trolls.  At first they were too busy talking to one another and
gnawing on a couple of shin bones to notice Absor, but they did indeed notice him
once they got into smelling range.

Absor dropped his pipes and lute and drew his weapon.  The things continued to advance,
edging ever closer, at an even pace.  Each stared blankly at him as if they weren’t
truly thinking about him, and as they got in range, Absor raised his blade and swung
at the filthy beasts.
<br><br>
But they were gone.  They seemingly vanished!  What strange troll magic was this?
Perhaps someone had cast an illusion of two trolls approaching.
<br><br>
Absor turned to his companion, "Archanalia, if you keep casting those illusions I
won’t help you down."
<br><br>
"Whuh?"
