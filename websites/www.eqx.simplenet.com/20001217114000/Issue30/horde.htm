The last ogre hit the blood soaked ground hard, and he lay still next to the bodies of his companions. After a moment, the dazed creature feebly struggled to crawl forward, away from the carnage.
<br><br>
The knight drew back his sword to take another swipe at his prey, then hesitated. His eyes narrowed. He had grown tired of this game. He gestured with his hands forming a glowing ball of light the size of a small emerald. The glowing ball of lightning grew at amazing speed, and threatened to explode from the knights hands. The knight eyed the ogre trying in vain to disentangle himself from the pile of corpses. He yelled out arcane words of sorcery and released the glowing lightning.
<br><br>
The stroke of lightning erupted from his hands so violently, it propelled the pitiful ogre back fifty feet through the air, then smashed him into the nearby mountain side. The ogre dropped heavily to the ground, his charred body slowly withering away. The ogre did not rise again.
<br><br>
"Quite an interesting way of killing ogres Jarek." a young man spoke out as he walked into the clearing.
<br><br>
"Humph..." muttered Jarek as he sheathed his weapon. "I wanted to get it over with Glenn.". Jarek began to move away from the bodies and towards the path leading into the woods. Glenn quickly ran up behind him and began to follow his lead on to the path.
<br><br>
"So are we going back to town now? I want to get my hands on those gold coins that Old Man was offering us to kill these ogres!" Glenn awaited the reply from Jarek.
<br><br>
"No, I want to find those other creatures the Old Man was going off about." Jarek said as he looked around the immediate area. "You're a tracker..so go find them."
<br><br>
"Damn, I just want to go back to town!" Glenn sighed as he kneeled down. He brushed his hand through the dirt and stood up. "Alright lets go..nothing here but a bunch of dead ogre bodies and......".
<br><br>
Jarek stopped and looked back. "What was that Glenn...oh my god...". Glenn's body lay limp on the ground, his head severed from the shoulders. The markings of an axe blade were evident across the remains of Glenns neck. Jarek quickly unsheathed his weapon and jumped into a combat stance. His feet began to dig deeply into the ground, giving him a better balance. 
<br><br>
    "Show yourself!! Show yourself damn it!!" Jarek yelled out. A rustling came from the nearby foilage. Jarek moved in closer, his sword raised over his head ready to strike down at the opponent. 
<br><br>
     Without warning, the sound of metal slamming into bone filled the air as a mighty battle axe ripped through Jarek's armor and into his shoulder blade.  Jarek fell to the ground in an instant. His arm, barely attached to the rest of his body, dangled at his side. Blood dripped to the ground as Jarek slowly rose from his feet. His face showed the signs of extreme pain, but his eyes managed to gaze at his opponent.
<br><br>
Before him stood the most grotesque creature he has ever seen. The creature seemed to have the head of a monster, but the body of a human being.  The creature's skin was a pale green, covered in battle scars and wounds. The creature grunted towards Jarek, its jaws clamping together with one or two teeth lunging above its upper lip. The creature held up the bloody axe which nearly mutilated Jareks arm and bellowed out a horrendous war cry. 
<br><br>
     Jarek gripped the sword with his one good hand, and readied himself for combat with the creature. The creature grinned at Jarek before letting out a menacing laugh. Jareks eyes widened as he looked into the trees of the nearby woods. Hundreds of the same creature he had just been battling with, were slowly heading into the clearing. 
<br><br>
     "The orcs...not this many....no...it cant..." Jarek moaned with pain as he spoke. The orc that had severed his arm moved towards Jarek and stood before him. With a quick upwards lift of the orcs battle axe, Jarek became as lifeless as the ogres he had slain earlier.
<br><br>
The orc lifted up the head of the knight and held it up high above his head looking at the surrounding orcs. The horde of orcs let out a howling war cry which thundered across the land, echoing in the distance. A lone orc moved away from the group and headed towards the clearing.
<br><br>
"Chieftan Shadar'Baal..me dinks we should set up a kamp fir da night. Da odder orcs are tired from da trip and we low on fuud. We can continoo on da trip in da morn.". The orc looked up at his superior awaiting his reply. The grey haired orc nodded and walked towards the rest of the group. The sun began to set between the mountain valley, as the orcs set up their camp.
<br><br>

<br>
"Shadar'Baal! We ready!!" shouted an orc from outside the tent.  Shadar'Baal rose from the rags which were used as his bed and walked outside.  The orcs were lined up awaiting the orders of Shadar'Baal. The chieftan pointed in the direction in which they were to be heading and then turned to the orc beside him.
<br><br>
"Zhul'Jaedin shuuld bring the army around da odder side of the mountain." grumbled the orc. "Me will bring da odders through da mountain pass to destroy da hummies dat occupy da area. Go now...and meet me at da valleys end.".  Zhul'Jaedin motioned towards his orcish army and they moved towards the path leading around the mountains. 
<br><br>
Shadar'Baal looked up towards his group and grunted signaling them to move. The orcs snorted in reply and began to march in line, following Shadar'Baal. By nightfall, the orcish army would soon meet up with the human forces occupying the mountain valley. Shadar'Baal grinned, knowing that human blood, will be spilt.
