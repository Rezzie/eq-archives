You know its time for a game to be released when you find yourself dreaming
about it.  I was surfing EQ sites on the web the other night, reading
everyone's E3 reports.   I remember reading a quote from Brad about dragon
sightings being rare, and that it would be a chronicle moment just to spot
one, and a major accomplishment to survive the encounter.  That must have
been in my subconscious when I went to sleep that night, as it inspired quite
a weird dream.

I was running down a freshly cut path in the middle of a jungle.  Vines
dangled, severed, outlining the contour of the footpath. The sound of
screaming monkeys could be heard, echoing throughout the area.  The jungle
was alive.   On my exposed skin mosquitoes gourmandized on the delicacy of my
blood. My breathing was labored, and my clothes were drenched in sweat.  I
must have been running for a while.

At the end of the path I found a clearing.  Actually it was a cliff
overlooking a huge valley.  A five hundred-foot waterfall could be viewed to
the right of the clearing.  Enormous amounts of clear blue water gushed out
its orifice, and into the lowland.  The high ground was made up of granite.
Its glass-like appearance distinguished it as impossible to climb.  The sun
beamed down above me, warming my sweaty wet clothes.
