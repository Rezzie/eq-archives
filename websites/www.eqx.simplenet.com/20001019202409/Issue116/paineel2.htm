</em>(In part one: Yusendill relates the ancient city, the coming of Erud, the stowaway Porj's founding of the Heretics, and Grahlinger and Myragul's discovery of the ancient city.)</em>

<br><br><br>
After looking around the city, Myragul, the powerful, young mage, and Grahlinger, the high elven shadowknight, returned to Erudin.
<br><br> 
"Let us return to the underground, the others will want to know what we've found," Grahlinger suggested.
<br><br>
"Nay," Myragul said, "the old man Porj would not be happy about our discovery.  I have a better idea.  Follow me."  With that the two went to Porj's house on the outskirts of town.  Well, perhaps house isn't the best word.  Hovel is more suited.  The wood was rotting, the paint peeling, and the lantern covered in cobwebs.
<br><br>
"Do you have your sword with you, Grahlinger?" Myragul asked.
<br><br>
"Aye, why do you care?" replied Grahlinger.
<br><br>
"Keep it on your belt, it is more polite than using the shoulder strap to hold it," ordered Myragul sharply. "Now when we go in, tell him about the ruins.  Make sure you show him the piece of stone you found there.  He shall like to see that…"
<br><br>
	Myragul then knocked on the door of Porj's hovel. "Just a minute!" was the reply heard within.  Both the elf and the mage rolled their eyes as the crashes of chairs were heard, always followed swiftly by a mumbled curse from Porj.  After a significant duration Porj emerged.
<br><br>
	"What do you want?" he asked, while rubbing his eyes to adjust to the light.
<br><br>
	"We have made a discovery!" Myragul said cheerfully! "We thought you would like to hear about it."
<br><br>
	"Well I suppose I would," Porj said, though the tone in his voice suggested that this was not a convenient time.  The three entered his house, which was completely dark.  Grahlinger, being a High Elf, had no trouble navigating through the void, but the two Erudites could not see in the dark.  However, Myragul removed the pair of spectacles from his pocket and set them on his nose.
<br><br>
	"Ah, much better," said Myragul with a sigh of relief.  His glasses were specially made in Neriak, magically endowed to grant the wearer the power to see in the dark.
<br><br>
	While Porj knocked down all of his furniture a second time, Myragul walked up next to Grahlinger and silently removed the sword from Grahlinger's belt and slipped it onto a special holder attached to his own hip.
<br><br>
	"Sit down please," said Porj.
<br><br>
"Ill stand," said Myragul, though Grahlinger elected to sit in the chair opposite Porj.
<br><br>
Now what have you found?" Porj asked when he sat down. "And tell me quick, I don't have time for a long tale," he added.
<br><br>
Grahlinger related their findings, while Porj looked on with disapproval.  Finally Grahlinger showed Porj the stones. "I can't see them," complained Porj, "Mamarill, fetch me a light."
<br><br>
As Myragul walked over to light a candle, he murmured "The name's Myragul, remember it well…" Myragul held the light up, and Porj peered at the stones that Grahlinger was holding.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Myragul drew out the sword, and quickly implanted it in Porj's back.   The old man yelled as he fell on the shabby table separating the two chairs.  Blood began pouring from the table to the floor, as Porj died, his eyes wide open in a look of shock.
<br><br>
"Come on," said Myragul calmly, "lets go to Erudin."
<br><br>
"But Porj is dead!"
<br><br>
"'Tis unimportant, he was a nuisance."  At that point Myragul lifted his hand and the body, as well as Grahlinger's sword melted into acid, which then seeped into the floor.
<br><br>
"My sword!' exclaimed Grahlinger.  "That cost several hundred platinum!"
<br><br>
"You were due for a new one."
<br><br>
The two set out toward Erudin and entered the underground basement where their meetings had been held.
<br><br>
As they entered, Yeref, a young female friend of Myragul asked, "where have you two been? We thought something might have happened!"
<br><br>
"Nay, <em>we</em> are fine, but our fallen leader Porj…" Myragul broke off, looking into space with a distraught expression on his face.
<br><br>
"What happened?" asked someone from the audience.
<br><br>
Grahlinger was about to speak, and then thought better of it.  Though Grahlinger was evil, he was still a High Elf, and a sense of morality gripped his conscience.  But it was fear and not guilt that held Grahlinger's tongue. 
<br><br>
Myragul continued "We were going to visit him to warn him of a spy from within when…" Myragul held his thumb and forefingers against his nose, as if recalling a painful memory, "we entered and found the Deepwater Knights had killed him!"
<br><br>
"Then they shall be after us, as well!" said Yeref, "What shall we do?"
<br><br>
"Aye! You are right!" said Myragul.  He had said this in a way that suggested that this idea had not entered his head, as obvious as it seemed.
<br><br>
Silence covered the room as the group thought.
<br><br>
Finally Myragul spoke up, "A while back, me and the elf had discovered these ruins in the forest.  Perhaps we could stay there until we can further examine the situation." 
<br><br>
After only a bit of arguing, they all agreed and set off toward the forest.
<br><br>
Arriving at the ruins they gazed upon the city of stone built upon more stone.  It was all in shambles with stones scattered across the landscape.
<br><br>
"This is pure desolation!" said someone from the rear.
<br><br>
"Nay, there is a better place through this other tunnel over here," suggested Myragul.
<br><br>
And so they came upon the field that opened up forming what is now referred to as the "newbie area".
<br><br>
"This looks to be a fine place to set up camp," said Myragul.
<br><br>
And so they established crude tents for that night.  Grahlinger couldn't help notice that Myragul places his tent next to Yeref's.   Grahlinger instead elected to use a blanket and sleep under the stars, as the weather was clear.  Grahlinger lied down far from the noise of the camps and slept.  
<br><br>
However Grahlinger was awakened during the night.  He woke to find two glowing red eyes looking into his.  He resisted the temptation to scream, and instead stood up.  The creature ran quickly into a cave toward the other end of the field. Grahlinger ran after it.  Two pillars and a marble roof enclosed the entrance to the cave.  "Classical-late-Combine architecture," Grahlinger mumbled to himself as he passed through a cavern with a small pool and then through another tunnel he followed.  Finally, he came to a pool of water surrounded by marble ramps leading down to it.  He followed the ramps, more slowly this time, to the bottom.  There in the pool a sword was floating in the water, in the center.  As Grahlinger approached the edge of the water the sword seemed to drift toward him.  He knelt down and picked it up.
<br><br>
Grahlinger turned the sword over in his hands and thought, "What kind of terrible power forged this sword?  I can feel it's tremendous energy flow into my veins!"
<br><br>
"My name is Lightsbane," the sword seemed to say.
<br><br>
"Yes Lightsbane!  They mightiest sword in existence is mine! <em>MINE!</em> Not Myragul's, not Loakh's, not Erud's but <em>MINE!</em>"  exclaimed Grahlinger as he held the sword aloft.
<br><br>
In the camp, Myragul woke up, and felt a cold chill run through his body.
