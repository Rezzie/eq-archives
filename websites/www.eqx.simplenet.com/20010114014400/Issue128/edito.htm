    - Oghma</font></b></big></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I&#146;ve 
    been taking a break from editorializing, since I&#146;ve been a bit busy with 
    a new job. I&#146;ve moved from working an hour away from home to working 
    5 minutes away, and the spare time I&#146;ve gained I&#146;ve used to work 
    on some other projects.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
    started a guild on Karana, made up of friends of mine from beta and good players 
    I&#146;ve met since then, and I&#146;ve been really enjoying it. We have a 
    weekly &#147;Get-Togedder&#148; and we are heavily on the role-playing side. 
    We&#146;ve taken breaks in fighting to play Leap-Froglok and believe me, you 
    haven&#146;t lived until you have seen 14 gnomes jumping each other&#146;s 
    bent-over bodies. Very fun! - someday I&#146;ll have to post a screen cap 
    of that.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
    makes this guild leadership suddenly important is the announced Karana Server 
    split. The Karana server has an interesting population. It is the &#147;official&#148; 
    French server, so it is home to quite a few players that play in traditionally 
    &#147;off-peak&#148; times. Thus, the Karana server, I believe, has the highest 
    average population, rarely dropping below 800 players, and often reaching 
    2700 at peak times. My packet loss lately has been steadily in the 25-30% 
    range, with frequent spikes into the 70&#146;s. Onnie, a server friend, can&#146;t 
    even get into Karana with packet loss that bad on her phone lines.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several 
    servers have been split, and it seems to be a rather inexact science. One 
    criteria used by Verant is the peak time population. They attempted to attract 
    peak-time users by only allowing the move command during peak time. The hope 
    is that those users who are placing the most population pressure (peak users) 
    on the server would then be the ones to move. That way, peak usage will drop 
    and put less pressure on the server. (perhaps dropping peak use from over 
    2500 to somewhere in the 1500 range.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
    last big split (Veeshan and Bristlebane moved to Saryrn, Xegony and Bertox 
    to The Seventh Hammer) resulted in s slight reduction in peak times on the 
    old servers, but not much. Veeshan and Bristlebane still go over 2000 at peak 
    times, and Bertox also. (I haven&#146;t kept track of Xegony, but I am aware 
    that it is lower than that.) Way back in beta during the discussion of server 
    stress, Verant mentioned that 1500 was their goal for a server&#146;s population. 
    At the time they were unaware that the servers could actually handle much 
    more stress, but generally by now over 2000 can be an accepted working ceiling 
    for server population.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
    difficulty lies, I believe, in the guild issue. As any guild member knows, 
    there is no guarantee that every member of a guild can be moved over to a 
    new server. Guilds, being active groups with active peak users then tend to 
    NOT move, because of the risk of losing guild members. Ironically, the heavy 
    peak time users then wind up staying on the old server, &#147;nerfing&#148; 
    the server split. Abashi recently commented that in the last split only 40% 
    of the people moved were peak users. Because of this, the Karana split is 
    being done not to a fresh server, but to one of the new servers recently split 
    into (Saryn or Seventh hammer being the most likely candidates) from high 
    peak servers.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our 
    guild, as many others I&#146;m sure, will not be moving to the new server, 
    whichever it is. We don&#146;t want to lose members, we don&#146;t want to 
    have to spend time leveling up a companion who wasn't logged in when a move 
    command was possible. The players having the highest impact on peak population 
    probably won&#146;t move, leaving Karana server with a reduced peak population, 
    but not really relieving much of the pressure. I believe that until a workable 
    guild moving solution presents itself, server splits will continue having 
    reduced impact.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
    are some of the difficulties with this issue? Why is it so hard to move an 
    entire guild?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let&#146;s 
    say a guild leader calls for a move/stay vote within a guild and the whole 
    guild unanimously votes to move. After being notified by the official guild 
    leader, Verant could run a list of all the guild members&#146; accounts and 
    move them all. They could continue this with each guild until the move population 
    reaches the maximum decided upon by Verant.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, 
    let&#146;s go a little farther and be more realistic - let&#146;s say that 
    80% of the guild votes to move, and some of the guild members haven&#146;t 
    played in that guild for several months having been more active in another 
    guild or playing other characters. Suddenly it&#146;s more complicated - a 
    guild-wide move could result in quite a few players suddenly switching to 
    the new server that were perhaps even unaware that their guild was moving! 
    Troublesome, indeed.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verant 
    recommends that people don&#146;t give anyone their station names, so a leader 
    could hardly give a list of accounts to move so as to exclude the members 
    who wished to stay. That would be open to abuse, anyway. If I knew someone 
    else&#146;s account, I could slide them into the new server without them knowing.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
    if, like the guild creation process, Verant created a chat room mechanism 
    where all those members who were in a guild and wish to move could all log 
    in at once? Or, even better, have a number count that the guild leader gives 
    when he sets up the channel and members who wish to move all issue a command 
    in the chat room sometime before the move, and when the member count reaches 
    the number count, that guild is moved. For example, say I have 40 members 
    who want to move - I&#146;ll create a chat room that is passworded and has 
    a member ceiling of 40. If those 40 members all log in and issue a move command, 
    poof, we move. If not, we don&#146;t, having not been able to reach the number 
    set. The accounts to move can be obtained from the accounts that logged into 
    the chat room. I&#146;m sure there are ways that I haven&#146;t considered 
    to address other difficulties. Perhaps accounts that are being moved could 
    be asked to re-login at a prompt to ensure that they wanted to be moved?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
    don&#146;t have access to the figures and information that Verant does, but 
    I hope that there is some way someday that guild moves could be accomplished 
    - otherwise, the issue of non-peak user moves will remain un-addressed, and 
    server splits will be less than satisfactory for all around.</font></p>
