Once upon a time I was the average male text "Mudder". I logged onto my favorite mud daily, power leveled because it was a competition not a game, and did not think of bringing my years and years of role-playing experience to the game. Then Meridian 59 came along, and I came up with some strange hybrid of role-playing. At first I just started with a main character that was really just me, and no role at all. No character, just more power playing. But because of the politics and maneuverings in that game I found it necessary to create alternate accounts in order to infiltrate enemy guilds for the benefit of my own. This brought the reality of online role-playing to life for me, and some of my early experiments of playing female characters were the start of a long history of cross-dressing for me online.
<br><br>
For many people this is normal, they do this all the time, and I especially know a lot of women who play male characters online to prevent harassment. I have found a lot of interesting things playing female characters online though and thought I would share them. 
<br><br>
Now I do know a lot about this subject, I actually was the leader of an all "female character" guild on UO Baja server. I specify "female character" like that because I am not foolish to think that out of 18 characters I was the only male behind the female online persona. Also, to fight off any flamers, although it could be interesting to read the flames, I am not gay, I am happily married to a woman and we have a normal healthy marriage. 
<br><br>
I want to dispel a few common thoughts about being female out there for many of the guys. Women are not hit on as they turn around every corner. I have played females on Meridian, UO and EQ now and for the most part us guys score quite well as gentlemen in my book. Of course I do get called "babe" a lot, but I dont find that offensive. I have had a couple guys come on strong, I have been called the female dog word, and some other things, but then those same people call guys names just as crude probably so I pay no attention. 
<br><br>
Secondly, women do not have it easy. I used to think that, even as I played some female characters, that some guys would give me things or help me twink in games only because I am female. But recently in EQ I have had just as many really nice people help out my male characters also. Nice people are nice people. If someone is going to give you an extra piece of patchwork when you only have enough for one piece, they would probably do it because you are role-playing, or asked nice, or thanked them nicely or whatever they see in people that they like. 
<br><br>
Are there guys who would give something extra to you just because you are female? Yeah maybe, and on Meridian I used this against a few enemies once or twice, but I really dont think it is that common.
<br><br>
As far as role-playing goes, its really just like playing any other role, you have to immerse yourself in the character. This really does mean get in touch with your female side. Sure, women can be big barbarian warriors, but there is still something different, that feminine quality to it. I kind of cheat at this part. Most of the personalities of my female characters are patterned after my wife. Any female you know well will work like this. Use their mannerisms, speech patterns and decision-making processes for this. Its really kind of neat how easy it is to slip into the mode of someone else and try to do what they would do in a game. Am I succeeding in being my wife? No, probably not but I certainly fool plenty of people. 
<br><br>
When I talk OOC with people in the game and I am in a female form I carry this on to discussions of RL also. I use my wife's life as mine, and instead of talking about my wife, I talk about my husband, which is really me. (Yeah, that is kind of confusing, but it works to keep things straight.)
<br><br>
Playing a female is really fun, actually, and for some reason I can't explain really gives me a different perspective of things in game. There are some SERIOUS don'ts though online like this, and I really hope people heed this. 
<br><br>
This may be role-playing, but there are REAL people on the other side of those avatars you are adventuring with. Do not trifle with the feelings of others. Its one thing to be coy or flirtatious, but I have seen this go too far. If you allow this to get out of hand, you deserve to be tarred, feathered and quartered as far as I am concerned.
<br><br>
Also, don't make a mockery of the character you are playing.  That is just another form of sexual harassment. 
<br><br>
Let your close fiends or guild mates know the truth. I don't always do this with characters that are not going to be affiliated with any guild and I am just testing something with starting stats in a game or something like that.  If you are going to spend a long time in female character, the people you spend the most time with should know. 
<br><br>
There is a Female Shaman that my male Monk adventures with occasionally named Branthara. She told me once when we first met that she is really a guy behind the toon, and I tell you, I forget this half the time. To role-players, it won't matter one way or another, but it's polite to tell the people you spend time with. 
<br><br>
Now, here I am advocating men playing female characters in EQ. Someone is not going to like this, that someone may read this and get the wrong idea, and go out into Norrath to hurt people. It's possible that the wrong person may get the wrong message here and use it for harm, and thats where my #1 online rule comes into play for the rest of you:  Bauhaus's #1 Online Rule: Assume that a 13-year-old boy is controlling all online characters.
<br><br>
For about 97% of this, that will keep us safe. For you 3% that like 13 year old boys and you are not a 13 year old girl? Get some professional help please.
