<hr color="black">
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  read quite a few of the articles you linked to on the web and they are mostly 
  filled with conjecture, false assumptions, and bible quotes taken completely 
  out of context. These people make money, make a living, at pointing out a common 
  enemy and directing their followers derision toward it, rightfully or not. Freemasonry 
  is also a common target of these people, despite the good they do for children 
  and other charities.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
  while D&amp;D and other FRPGs, rock music and fictional storires do not directly 
  cause a person to become a satanist, someone with a weak mind, easily led or 
  controlled, can take the information within these games and stories and try 
  to incorporate it into their real world. It gives them a direction. Then again, 
  it could have been &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; or the game Monopoly that directed 
  their will.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  actually do know a person who became a self-professed Satanist, claiming that 
  D&amp;D &quot;showed him the light.&quot; The way he explains it however, is 
  that Satanism is not Devil Worship, his belief is that the vices of life are 
  placed here for a reason, for us to enjoy to their fullest, then at the end, 
  to return to the fold as did the prodigal son. Another example of taking a bible 
  quote out of context, and just as foolish as the D&amp;D detractors.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  point is, while it isn't the fault of D&amp;D, D&amp;D can give a real life 
  direction to people with weak minds, and those people's parents are responsible 
  to ensure they are not exposed to something that would affect them so. The problem 
  is the parents would rather place the blame than take the responsibility.</font></p>

  so.&#148;</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&#146;s 
  also important to note that D&amp;D can give real life direction to someone 
  who needs some direction, and the interactions, problems-solving, and social 
  skills learned through D&amp;D can guide them and teach them how better to act 
  in real life.</font></i></p>

  out there!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  wanted to say that all this stuff about religion and gaming is making me lose 
  my mind. I think what I'm saying is &quot;Shut up, and just have fun playing 
  the damn game!&quot;, but I could be wrong. =)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  do not see why everybody has to attach one thing to another. I mean, Satanism 
  to D&amp;D... I can see it being thought of that way, but I can also see it 
  as being a big pile of bull-funky.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  do want to commend you on putting up that one link to &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot;.

  EVIL? Shya!!! What was this guy smoking?!?!? I WANT SOME!!!!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
  all joking aside, if you notice lately, all these religious groups are <br>
  suddenly attacking anything that is pop culture. Wether it be those darling 
  little smurfs, RPGs, The World Wrestling Federation, most of the television 
  Prime-Time lineups, any form of music (I think I read somewhere about them getting 
  angry at, of all people, Yanni. YANNI?!?!? WHAT THE FRELL?!?!?), and the list 
  goes on and on. If anything, it's like brainwashing the masses. I center the 
  blame on the 700 Club, myself. They're raising money all the time, esentially 
  trying to sell shares of &quot;heaven&quot; to anyone with the cash. Anyone 
  notice how big Pat Robertson's house is? Makes ya think, doesn't it.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
  it all comes down to is everyone trying to make a quick buck on the ignorant 
  and the popular. Nothing more than that. Feel free to disagree with my thoughts 
  on the subject, but that's how I see it.</font></p>

  Winter,<br>
  <br>
  I just wanted to mention that although I personally have no problem with people 
  being ignorant of others' beliefs, you may have offended some with your attack 
  on the mention of &quot;Real Spell Books&quot;. I, along with a rapidly-growing 
  population of Pagans (Wiccans, Druids, the like..) do believe that there ARE 
  &quot;Real Spell Books&quot;. I'm not going to go into detail, for they have 
  nothing to do with my message, but I think you should consider the source and 
  meaning of what someone says in a message, before ridiculing what could be a 
  part of an individual's religious practice.<br>
  <br>
  Thank you,<br>
  Cory</font></p>

  <i>Thank you for your letter. I just wanted to mention that I personally have 
  no problem with being called an ignoramus, but there are others who might be 
  offended at your claim that people who find humor in a topic are ignorant of 
  it. I believe that there IS real humor to be found in many topics, including 
  but not limited to, games, politics, religion, noisy bodily functions, new age 
  music, and most of all, tits, but that's not important now. I hope people will 
  consider the source, and the context of what someone publishes in a column before 
  taking offense and erroneously hoisting the ignorance flag. In the interest 
  of cooperation, I&#146;ll make you a deal. I&#146;ll apologize for saying that 
  Barnes and Noble doesn&#146;t carry real spell books, if you&#146;ll levitate 
  my black Toyota Tacoma. It&#146;s not really MINE and I don&#146;t drive it 
  to work, but I would really like to start a bunch of black helicopter rumors 
  here.</i></font></p>
