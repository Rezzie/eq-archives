'Twas not four score but seven long and tragic years ago<br>
I chanced to bump my head in Freeport; how I do not know.<br>
Was it a roguish fiend who struck me just to gain my purse?<br>
Or was it some adventurer I failed to reimburse?<br>
It could have been the influence of too much gypsy wine,<br>
Or it could be a vengeful old associate of mine.<br>
Whatever was the cause of it, I must have lost my mind<br>
And wandered all about the region for a span of time.<br>
When I awoke I found myself buck-naked and bereft<br>
Of any armor, weapon, cloak; some fiendish type of theft<br>
Had left me without any means of merely scraping by.<br>
Crushed, I sat down on the ground and then began to cry.
 <br><br>
Through my tears I saw a good old friend (Stormline by name);<br>
He gave me basic arms by which all heroes gain their fame.<br>
Then Hawkwind, an old friend I used to knew before my loss<br>
Informed me that he held my things that I had tried to toss<br>
While fuzzy-brained and drunk out on the streets of Freeport North.<br>
Apparently I'd quite forgotten what those things were worth.<br>
Starhawk, Namus, Thaylos, others came unto my aid<br>
And furnished me that I may once again swing fist and blade.<br>
Old acquaintances I'd long forgotten in my daze<br>
Welcomed me with merry cheer; in truth, I was amazed<br>
And shocked that after such a time my memory lived on<br>
While I was languishing and stupefied hin and anon.
 <br><br>
Again back on my feet and wandering about the lands,<br>
I now run bardic mail from Queynos to the Commonlands.<br>
And yet the questions plague me - what did I do unaware<br>
And what deeds could some claim are mine while I knew not nor cared?<br>
Did I aid wicked inkie bands and lead an evil life?<br>
Was I enslaved to someone just to play my drum and fife?<br>
Did some foul magic dazzle me to act against my will?<br>
And were I evil then, am I considered evil still?<br>
By far the most important question that I have to pose<br>
Is this: what women did I bed without my mind and clothes?
