	<big><big>A</big></big>side form the obvious differences which I will not list here (hey they're obvious), there are a numbers of areas where differences may not be so obvious. Two major concerns that I have seen people post about are multiple characters on the same server and the ever popular PK issue. The purpose of this article is to point out differences in the two games that will, hopefully, put people's minds at ease.
<br><br>
<b>Issue one: MULES</b>:
<br><br>
The first issue I will address is multiple characters on the same server and the problem of mule characters. A mule, for those who don't know, is a dummy character that a player creates to fill some need of the main character. Popular uses for mules in UO were things like item storage (mostly for Dreads who couldn't use the banks in town), traders (again for Dreads who could not buy and sell goods in town), and skilled labor (blacksmiths to repair armor, carpenters to furnish buildings, alchemists to make potions etc.) Here is why this won't be much of an issue in EQ…

In EverQuest there will be "evil" aligned towns. This means that anyone with an unsavory reputation will have a place to trade goods. If there is a rented locker bank like system it is logical to assume that both good and evil towns will have the same services available. Remember, unlike UO where everyone started out "good" and could only become "evil" if they committed crimes, a good portion of EQ characters <b> start out </b> with an evil alignment. Trolls and Shadow Knights, for example, are evil by nature. These characters who are <b>supposed</b> to be bad guys obviously need a place to conduct business.
<br><br>
The other main use for mules in UO was skilled labor. Why would anyone learn carpentry or higher a tailor when they could just make a mule to do the same job? Mules work for free and do not waste skill points. Because of the class system in EQ this should not be as much of a problem. The only class that anyone might consider making a mule for is Enchanter and what is a first level enchanter going to be good for? Most likely only people who play enchanters full-time will be able to do anything worth while.

As for skills like black-smiting, again, I doubt that a day old character would be able to do much. I remind you that in EQ just using a skill will not improve it. One must "gain experience in 3 ways (completing quests, killing monsters and finding treasure) and then translate that experience into new and/or improved skills." [quote from an EQ review] The good smiths will be high level fighters that spent a few skills points every level getting better, not mules who were given 2k ingots by a main character and set up with a macro program while their creator watched a movie. 
<br><br>
<b>Issue two: PKs:</b>
<br><br>
Many people worry that the choice between PvP and non-PvP in EQ will be no choice at all. If the switch it is set to non-PvP they will be sacrifice an important aspect of Role Playing. If it is set to PvP then they will be at the mercy of "mindless PKs" as in UO. This is why you shouldn't worry too much…
