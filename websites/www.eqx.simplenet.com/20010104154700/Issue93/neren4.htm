<br><br>


	"Incoming!"
<br><br>
	Neren's force was allowed a break.  They sat near the center of the platform and watched passively as another attack came.  It was the Gnolls this time.  The cries from Blossom were becoming louder by the minute.  Even the elders were becoming annoyed.  But the Elves remained stern, silently watching each Gnoll reluctantly retreat back into the forest.  The Gnolls didn't like the trees and often they tried to cut them, but the trees threatened them as they raised their axes, enchanted by Tunare.
<br><br>
	Fireshine made a signal.
<br><br>
	"Already?" an Elf complained.
<br><br>
	Neren watched as another Elf nudged a sleeping Dwarf who had obviously spent hours at a tavern.
<br><br>
	Neren's body at first stubbornly refused to stand but it gave way after a few seconds and he rushed to the edge with Duror and Gilerrin.  Heartwood had gone to supervise another lift unfortunately, so Duror had to lead his party.  He had nearly gone crazy by using his mana so quickly and nearly making an energy feedback.  Gilerrin was busy fletching more arrows with Tinky who was creating another object of seemingly no use.  Luegwen, a friend of Duror's, joined Neren and Duror.  His rogue skills proved useful as he helped pinpoint targets for the others.
<br><br>
	"This is worrying me…" said Neren.
<br><br>
	Duror wasn't listening.  He was mindlessly following Luegwen's finger and casting.
<br><br>
	"They keep sending attack after attack.  They're trying to wear us down."
<br><br>
	"You finally realized that?" Gilerrin said dully behind Neren.
<br><br>
	"Actually there's more to it than that.  Gilerrin get over her, you have the best tracking skills, do you sense anything in the trees?"
<br><br>
	"No."
<br><br>
	"Come on, get over here.  I mean it."
<br><br>
	Gilerrin grumbled as he stood up and walked to Neren.  He peered at the trees.  "The rangers are returning."
<br><br>
	As if on cue, someone shouted, "Ranger party returning!  Hold arrows!"
<br><br>
	The rangers were well armed and were returning with much needed water and deadwood for arrows.  The Dark Elves below began to chant.
<br><br>
	"Watch out!"
<br><br>
	A bolt of lightning from north of Kelethin struck a ranger and she fell unconscious to the ground.
<br><br>
	"Someone save her!"
<br><br>
	"It's too late."
<br><br>
	Neren watched in horror as another ranger was struck and their bodies torn apart by the hungry evil creatures under them.  A druid began chanting loudly over the dark storm and holy rain began pouring on them.  The spell killed many and forced the Dark Elves to cast fire and necromancy spells on Kelethin.  For the first time several Elves were massacred.  The cold hearts of the Teir'Dal overpowered Kelethin for a second and the druids cast lightning and storm spells.  A whirlwind of good and evil magic began to form above them.
<br><br>
	Singing erupted beautifully above the din and Kelethin and its inhabitants began to heal.  Bolts continued to strike Kelethin, but the majority of them landed in the opponents' hordes.  The druid power of nature was unrivaled and this message became clear as a tornado landed in the forest.  The forest moaned as it sacrificed a few trees for the good of all.
<br><br>
	Neren's ears were filled with screams.  "Keep firing!" he shouted, but he couldn't even here his own voice.  However Gilerrin amazingly heard him and poured arrow after arrow into the fray below.  The singing of the bards seemed to diminish as the roar crescendoed.
<br><br>
	Suddenly a clear message formed inside his head and he saw that the other races had also received it: fight on the ground!  The message was clearly a quickly and crudely cast spell by a head enchanter.
<br><br>
	With a roar the Dwarves let down several rope ladders and climbed down.  The Elves, caught in the heat of the battle challenged the Dwarves as they jumped and clambered down the trees like squirrels.  Dill Fireshine looked across to an adjacent platform and challenged the levitating Dwarven commander who would gain the most kills.  With a very audible roar, the goodhearted Dwarf jumped down to join the fray.  Fireshine laughed and literally dove into the crowd below with his ranger skills.
<br><br>
	Neren's heartbeat was as rapid as the rate he was climbing down a tree.  He grinned up at Gilerrin who was doing likewise.  A few feet above the ground he jumped while unlatching his axes and pounced on the nearest monster he saw.  Neren's warrior blood boiled within him and his eyes showed his bloodlust.  He slaughtered Orc after Orc with a mouth curved upward in revenge.  Gilerrin jumped down along side them and they fought back to back.  They encountered an Orc legionnaire, which Gilerrin slew with a well-thrown axe.
<br><br>
	Neren received a gash on his right arm, but the blow only seemed like a minor sting.  Adrenaline pumped into his body and his eyes grew wider with joy.  Gilerrin began to notice Neren's strange behavior even as he was busy defending himself from a skilled Troll
<br><br>
	"Neren!"
<br><br>
	Neren didn't hear him.  His heart was beyond listening.  He launched himself into the nearest mob of enemies.  Gilerrin only saw a blur in his bloodstained eyes.
<br><br>
	Meanwhile he found himself busy trying to handle a powerful Gnoll.  Although his skill was formidable for his level, the Gnoll outclassed him in every way.  He parried, dodged, riposted, but nothing worked against this creature.  The Gnoll's sword battered his and he retreated awkwardly.  Finally he turned and ran, but his path was blocked by more Gnolls.  He looked back and up to see the sword coming down in his head.  He saw the Gnoll's face gleam with extreme pleasure, but that expression soon changed into a look of surprise.  Gilerrin found the strength to dodge sideways, and the sword fell onto one the slain Gnoll's colleagues.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin looked around for his savior.
<br><br>
	"Gilerrin!"
<br><br>
	He knew that voice.  At last, he spotted him running toward him with a two handed sword raised as if to strike.  He jumped out of the way awkwardly and fell to the ground, stumbling on an Orc's corpse.  He sat up just in time to see Renidyen finish off a Troll.
<br><br>
	<em>Renidyen</em>?  "Renidyen!"
<br><br>
	"No time for chat," Renidyen said.  He ducked under a clumsily swung axe and dispatched its owner.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin caught up with him.  "We have to save Neren!"  He breathlessly explained the story.
<br><br>
	Renidyen nodded his head quickly and set off toward Kelethin's Orc lift platform.  On the way, he jumped after an Orc chasing an Elf.  He slashed at it, mortally injuring it, but the damage was done and Elvish casualty count increased by one.
<br><br>
	When he they reached where Gilerrin had last seen Neren, the site was filled with corpses of both good and bad races.  The place was abandoned and Gilerrin saw tracks leading toward Crushbone.
<br><br>
	"We must be winning."
<br><br>
	Renidyen nodded seriously when he observed the Orc and Gnoll tracks.  They ran around looking for Neren's corpse, if he was dead, but Gilerrin refused to believe it; Neren was born for something greater than this.  He knew it.  <em>Damn you!  I'll find you no matter what bars me!  Only my or your death will stop me!</em>  He whispered a prayer to Tunare.
<br><br>
	"Gilerrin, over here!"
<br><br>
	Above the overwhelming stench of rot, he felt his heart plunge.  He rushed over to Renidyen, his heart pounding.  Fortunately, it wasn't Neren, but one of Neren's spare axes.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin gripped the axe with determined, glazed-over eyes.  "He's still alive, I can feel it!"
<br><br>
	Renidyen didn't bother to ask how he knew.  He glanced up at the occasional streak of magical firepower shooting across the sky.
<br><br>
	The storm above them was calming, and the friends began to hear shouts and screams again.  The air was hot a stuffy and Renidyen was eager to leave.  He motioned for Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	They ran toward the Orc camps.  When they reached it, they saw a small Orcish counterattack aided by Dark Elvish magic.  A powerful Troll shaman stood atop an Orc tent chanting.  Swirls of blue magic enveloped the Orcs, healing them.  Renidyen and Gilerrin raced toward the front of the main battle.
<br><br>
	Suddenly they both saw an axe fly over and past the line of scrimmage to strike the Troll on the forehead.  A shout of victory erupted from the Elvish and Dwarvish side of the battle.  Gilerrin recognized the special tint on the axe and shouted, "That's Neren's axe!"
<br><br>
	The friends found Luegwen on the way, badly wounded and lying under a great tree for protection and cover.
<br><br>
	"Are you alright?" said Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	"I can't feel my arm!  I can't feel my arm!"
<br><br>
	Gilerrin looked anxiously at Renidyen who was inspecting the broken arm.  "Do we have to amputate it?"
<br><br>
	"No, wait."
<br><br>
	He laid his hands on Luegwen's chest.  Instinctively, he cringed under the touch and cried out in pain.  Gilerrin observed Luegwen must have a broken, or at least fractured, a rib.  "Well?" he said anxiously.
<br><br>
	Renidyen closed his eyes and healing magic flowed from his hands to Luegwen.  In an instant, Luegwen was fully healed.  Renidyen extended a hand to help him up.
<br><br>
	"Come on!  No time to explain." Renidyen said.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin ran toward the advancing front.  The enemy counterattack had miserably failed.  He saw several magical explosions and lethal bolts fly through the air toward the enemy.  The Dark Elves responded with vigor and several Elves suddenly fell as they ran.  A volley of arrows flew from above them to strike the Gnolls unaware.  Gilerrin glanced up to see several hidden rangers arming their bows.
<br><br>
	At the Crushbone entrance, the Dark Elves halted their retreat and commanded the Orcs and Gnolls to protect them.  The entrance would obviously be extremely hard to penetrate.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin heard a shout of joy, and he found the voice's owner.  "Neren!"
<br><br>
	Neren laughed.  "You thought I was dead?  It was fun!  And you missed most of the fight."
<br><br>
	"Actually, I was also busy with a friend."
<br><br>
	"Friend?  You mean Luegwen."
<br><br>
	Gilerrin smiled.  Neren's faced was scarred and cut and blood covered his armor.  His axes were unstained, being magical. He was covered head to toe with bruises and minor scrapes and cuts.  He gave a questioning look.  At that point, Renidyen arrived, helping Luegwen who was still a bit weak from lack of energy.  Neren's jaw dropped.  He was genuinely speechless.
<br><br>
	"What are you gawking at?  You'd think I would run away from my homelands without a fight?  There's a battle here - no time to lose!"
<br><br>
	Neren grinned.  He skirted the mess in the valley near the Crushbone entrance.  After a volley of arrows killed half of the Orcs and Gnolls there, he concentrated and cast a quick Burst of Fire, injuring an Orc.  A Gnome finished it off.  Gilerrin rushed ahead against the incoming Orc pawns and centurions.  Renidyen and Luegwen joined him and slaughtered the tiny attack.
<br><br>
	Luegwen pointed toward an incoming Gnoll.  "There!"
<br><br>
	Gilerrin quickly notched an arrow to his bow and fired.  The projectile struck home.  "Next," he said.
<br><br>
	A stray Orc centurion was running from the battle.  Luegwen threw a dagger and his dexterity and skill was clear after the throw.  Neren did a funny hop-skip dance of impatience.  "What are we doing here?  Let's fight with our fellow Elves, not pick off stray foes."
<br><br>
	Without waiting for a response, he dove past the line of scrimmage.  This time Gilerrin and the others followed.
<br><br>
	Neren eventually met his match: a Dark Elf warrior.  He slashed high then low with the other axe.  The tactic failed as he had expected but he kept on the offensive.  He accidentally slew a passing Orc.  The distraction cost him a deep cut in his left arm.  With a roar of rage, he launched himself anew at his opponent.  For each blow, he struck a harder one.  He slashed at the Dark Elf's legs then at the arm.  He parried a slash, then kicked out at the Dark Elf.  Neren was rewarded with a cry of surprise.  However, the Dark Elf retained his balance and the battle continued.  Neren fought him out of the main battle area, much to the dismay of his friends.  But the look on Neren's face told Gilerrin and the others, he was determined to win the fight alone.
<br><br>
	The Dark Elf had a calm face, but Neren was not fooled.  He slashed vertically downwards.  Then he struck sideways.  Again the Dark Elf was prepared, but his face was beginning to show weariness.  Encouraged, Neren drove the Dark Elf back then cast a quick damage spell.  The explosion blinded the Dark Elf, and that usually allowed Neren to dispatch a foe.  But the Dark Elf dodged and parried.  Neren hid his disappointment and the fight continued.
<br><br>
	He swung his axes expertly, never allowing one to be disarmed.  He often swung horizontally which the Dark Elf had a hard time parrying.  Neren's axes whipped threw the air constantly, driving the tiring Dark Elf even further from the main battle.
<br><br>
	Neren swung low again, managing to inflict a hit on the leg.  The cut was only minor though.  Neren kicked again, striking the Dark Elf's chest.  And again, Neren failed to make the finishing blow.  The Dark Elf rolled over and made a deep gash at Neren's side.  Neren flinched in pain, but his eyes still showed of bloodlust and his body would not allow him to fall.  He seemed to have infinite energy, spurred by battle, his swings stronger and more accurate by the second.
<br><br>
	Finally the Dark Elf tried one last effort to destroy his opponent.  He threw his two swords at Neren.  Neren was able to dodge one, but the other struck his shoulder.  He screamed in pain.  The Dark Elf took flight, seeing the chance.
<br><br>
	Neren howled as he pulled out the sword, feeling cheated, but he doggedly chased the Dark Elf.  The Dark Elf was hopelessly lost in the forest.  Neren grinned with glee when he caught sight of him again.  He took a shortcut, swung around a tree and struck the Dark Elf on the head with both of his legs.  He landed beautifully, turned around, and ended the Dark Elf's life swiftly.  The Dark Elf let out one last gurgle, before Neren pulled his axes from the throat.
<br><br>
	Neren limped toward the main fight.  Eventually he heard shouts again and the clash of steel on steel.
<br><br>
	Once he reached the area, he collapsed onto the soft grass.  His friends were waiting for him.  They gasped at his condition when they found his unconscious form.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin was the assumed leader of the group now.  "Listen, we have to get Neren back to Kelethin.  Luegwen, stay here, and continue to fight.  The others might have uses for you."
<br><br>
	Renidyen objected, wanting to fight, but Gilerrin cut in.  "I'll need some defense when I'm carrying his body."
<br><br>
	Renidyen's face showed stubbornness but he agreed.  Renidyen killed the remaining Orcs at the Orc camps while trekking through the area.  When they reached Kelethin, they called for help.
<br><br>
	They waited for half a minute then called again.  An adult Elf climbed down from Kelethin and aided in carrying Neren's body to the nearest healer.
