<p style="text-align: justify">Hoi there! Lrets D'pearl here with the latest and greatest in trends across Norrath! Apparently the denizens of Unrest manor have been having a little problem. Their courtyard seems to be overrun with corpses these days. Now, normally, for undead creatures of the night this is not a problem. However, with the upsurge in tourists this Summer, the body count in the area has just become too intolerable. </P>

<p style="text-align: justify">So... with a little bit of ingenuity and creative thinking ... the hags of Unrest have come up with a wonderful solution to handling the immense influx of corpses. Here's an interview with none other than the Mother Hag of Unrest herself! </P>

<EM><P>The denizens of Unrest have come up with an ingenious way to deal with the piles and piles of corpses that have been building up in their courtyard, and have unwittingly started a runaway trend amongst the Undead community.</EM> </P>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b><em>Lrets:</em></b> Hoi there! This is ... uh ... quite an interesting use for a dead body ... errr ... I must say &lt;Thinks to himself 'I swear I'm gonna kill Absor for givin' me this assignment'&gt; </P>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b><em>Hag Mother:</em></b> &lt;CACKLECACKLEWAILCACKLE&gt; Yeeeessssss! my sweetsssssss! Isn't nice tho?! EEEHHHEEEEEEEHEHHEHEEEEE! &lt;CACKLE&gt; My sisters and I were sooo distressed at the slovenly mess with all those beautiful corpses strewn all over the place! I mean! Just imagine if Lord Grimrot or Lord D'vinn decided to drop by for some Blood Tea to see what a mess our courtyard is. I just DIE of embarrassment at the thought! AAHHHHAAAAAA HEEEHEHHE &lt;CACKLE&gt; </P>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b><em>Lrets:</em></b> Errr .. um .. yes ... soo ... uuhhhh &lt;Edges away as the Hag starts nibbling on his fingers&gt; Um .. how did you come up with such an extraordinary idea? </P>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b><em>Hag Mother:</em></b> &lt;CACKLE&gt; Well .. the beauty of it is that it came up by pure accident. One of me pet Dry Bone Skeletons, the little deary, tripped over one of these corpses the other day and kicked the poor thing out of frustration. Apparently his anger was so great that the body flew clear across the room and imbedded itself onto one of me Iron Maidens that happened to be open. When we went to clean it up ... we realized how beautiful it looked, and voila! We finally came up with an idea of how to handle all the corpses in our courtyard. &lt;Eyes me hungrily with those deadly red eyes&gt; Ye know ... I've yet to do any work with a Half elf yet ...</P>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b><em>Lrets:</em></b> eerrrrr &lt;shifts unobtrusively towards the side entrance ... failing to notice that the pile of bones that was on the floor next to him is no longer there .. but is actually now standing behind him&gt; Um ... that's quite all right .. in fact I hear ye'r idea has caught on like wild fire with the Necro and Undead communities ... in fact they are copying ye'r idea across the continent ... where I'm sure they have plenty of half elves &lt;Makes a break for the door and bumps into Dry Bone skeleton looming behind him&gt; </P>

<p style="text-align: justify"><img src="brigde.jpg" width=640 height=480 border="0"></P>
<EM>
<p style="text-align: justify"> Apparently Necromancers and other Undead communities have taken up the hobby and started to create "Corpse art" of their own. Where this will lead ... only time can tell.</EM> </P>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b><em>Hag Mother:</em></b> That's nice sweety ... now be a deary ... and sit still while I insert this dagger into ye'r throat. &lt;CACKLECACKLE&gt; </P>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b><em>Lrets:</em></b> ACK! This is Lrets D'pearl Aspiring Bard Extraordinaire and Freelance Reporter for EQ Express ... sending out a cry for help from the depths of Unrest ... HHHHEEELLLLLPPPPPP!</P>
