High above the valley, almost hidden by the sun, I could see a small black
bird flying.  The bird was enjoying the morning sunbeams, and gliding in the
wind.  I continued my search for a suitable path to the river below.
<br><br> 
As I was about to head off towards the edge cliff I heard a deafening
screech. The voices of the jungle quieted.  It was a frightening silence.  
I looked upward to where I thought the origin of the sound came from.
That small bird was no bird at all.

Circling high above the valley the predator hovered looking for its morning
meal. It was at least the size of a football field in length, and its
wingspan twice as wide.  It was still at least two hundred feet above me, and
I didn't think it had taken notice of my presence.  I stood frozen not even
breathing.  Narrowing its distance between us, the dragon stopped and hovered
in mid air about one hundred feet above me.  Its massive head arched back and
turned in my direction.  I'm almost positive our eyes made contact.  The
dragon grunted, lowered his head, and dove towards me.  Looking and sounding
much like the Tyrannosaurus Rex in the movie "Jurassic Park", teeth glaring,
saliva drooling he continued towards me.  I turned and ran.

Like the typical Jason victim in every "Friday the Thirteenth" movie, I
tripped over every obstacle that came within five feet of my path.  This
sudden unwelcome urge to be a total klutz!
<br><br>
I knew the dragon was gaining on me, his shadow growing larger around me.
He must have been at tree top level.  I could hear the branches snapping,
severed from the force of his wings.  He swooped over me and hovered above
in front of me.  I stood paralyzed.  I knew I couldn't outrun this beast.
