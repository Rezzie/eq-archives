    <td style="text-align: justify">   "Honey come watch this.   I can't believe this.  I FINISHED it!" my wife screamed at me from the downstairs computer room.
<br><br>
I ran down the stairs to see what all the excitement was.  
<br><br>
There stood all three of my children standing behind their mother watching the computer screen.  My oldest son looked at me and started laughing.  Most likely laughing because of his mother's childish behavior.

There sat my wife, rocking back and forth in her seat, celebrating as she watched the final cut scene from the game Might & Magic VI.  After three months of gaming she had finally beaten the game without using any cheats or codes.  <em>If it were me I would have cheated (That game was hard!)</em>.
<br><br>
"Honey that's just great!" I said to her.  
<br><br>
I stood there looking at her, admiring my accomplishments.  How do you tell your wife how happy you are she is a fully graduated geek?  I was so damn proud of her.  
<br><br>
I was proud of me!
<br><br>
All the work I had done to get her here.  The countless hours of answering questions like.
<br><br>
"How do I double click" or "Can you help me?  What does Fatal <em>IO ERROR Hard Drive not found</em> mean?"
<br><br>
Since I wrote that article "<a href="../Issue20/wife.htm">How To Geektify Your Wife 101</a>" on EverQuest Express (geeez how long ago was that?) I have seen links to the article on other forums, and received email from all kinds of people asking me how I really did it, or just asking for advice.  
<br><br>
"How did you get your wife into computers.  How did you turn a computer illiterate wife into a gaming master?"
<br><br>
I have to be honest with my readers.  I know what things I did, obviously because I wrote the article, but I just <em>can't</em> figure out how the hell it worked.  
<br><br>
Let me start with the things I'm sure of, and go from there.
<br><br>
1.  She must love me:  
<br><br>
She has too!  How else could anyone put up with a dead head sitting at a computer for sometimes fourteen hours at a time, not doing anything but move his right hand and breath?
<br><br>
"What is so damn interesting about that computer!  What is it that you see?" She would often say.
<br><br>
She took a general interest in what I was doing and asked questions.  She always makes an effort to show an interest in what I'm doing.  I honestly believe if your spouse does not ask you questions, she/he must not care much about you!
<br><br>
2. She has an interest in new things and is not afraid to learn.
<br><br>
My wife loves to try new things, and is never afraid to get her hands dirty.  She is the home mechanic.  Anything that has internal parts she can fix.  It is not uncommon to find my wife watching shows like "The Home Repair Show", or  "Home Improvement", that you find on the Discovery Channel or PBS.  
<br><br>
Sometimes it's actually embarrassing.
<br><br>
I'm at work and the phone rings...
<br><br>
"Hello?" I answered.
<br><br>
"Hey Honey its me."
<br><br>
"Hey!  How is your day?"
<br><br>
"Well I took the broken antenna apart on your car." ….  <em>One night during "Home Coming" someone decided my car would look better without an antenna</em>….  "And I went to Toyota and bought a new antenna and installed it.  It's working great." She said.
<br><br>
"Wow.  Thank you!" I said, blushing, looking around to make sure no one was listening.
<br><br>
These things I know for sure helped in making my wife the "geek" she is today.
<br><br>
But did "I" really have anything to do with my wife's geeking success at all?  Maybe she became this Gaming monster in retaliation.
<br><br>
Let's take a look at one of my Internet buddies.  To protect her identity we'll just call her [<em>cough</em>] "Goddess_One".   Now I really don't know her husband well, but one day she told me in ICQ that she started gaming because she simply could not figure out what was so great about the computer that had obviously taken control of her husband.  She told me he would spend hours on hours gaming, leaving her alone in the house.  
<br><br>
<em>He reminded me of... well...    ME!</em>
<br><br>
"You just don't know how lonely a person can feel with your spouse in the same house."  She said.
<br><br>
<em>Gee I remember hearing that before.</em>
<br><br>
So she started playing Diablo when he was not around.  After a few weeks playing she was totally hooked.  After several multiplayer games, it is her husband that is feeling alone and left out.  Both of them now have computers, and hers obviously being the more powerful of the two.  I'm told they now only communicate via ICQ.
<br><br>
Two of my other friends actually work for EverQuest Express.  Our own Keafa (Ian Ash's wife), and Ian Ash.
<br><br>
One night on IRC, Keafa was telling a few of us how she got into computers and gaming.  She was bored of watching Ian play [<em>cough</em>] work for hours on the computer so she decided to check it out for herself.  I'm not sure she started with games, or if it was chatting on IRC.
<br><br>
Now she has a feature column on EQX, and is well known in the EQ community on IRC, and I'm told they fight over the keyboard nightly, having only one computer.  
<br><br>
Did God_One or Ian Ash have anything to do with their wives becoming "Geeks"? 
<br><br>
Did I have anything to do with mine?
<br><br>
I guess only our wives can answer that question.
<br><br>
<em>…Razor hangs his head in deep thought and slowly walks off into the darkness…</em>
<br><br><br>

HELL NO!  WAIT!  This story can't end like this!  I spent hours teaching my wife how to use the computer.  I have invested years of training my wife and our children how to use the Internet.  I have written articles on how to properly train and educate your spouse to the ways of the GEEK!   I AM THE MASTER!
<br><br>
<em>I hear an ominous laugh coming from the kitchen…</em>
<br><br>
- The maybe NOT so great Razor.
