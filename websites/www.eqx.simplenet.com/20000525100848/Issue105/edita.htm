Verant has a new employee.  They've hired Gordon Wrinn to be, at least it appears as his primary task, Verant's representative to the Internet.  Known at one time as Abashi, this fellow was one of the early beta testers.  His knowledge of the game and its mechanics is pretty solid, more so now that he has a direct pipeline to the developers.  From the little contact that I've had with him, I have a pretty good opinion of him.  So congratulations to both Verant and Abashi.
<br><br>
But while congratulating Abashi, I also don't envy him.  He is, basically, one of three people that has the ability to respond publicly to the hundreds of thousands of EverQuest players.  And unlike the other two he can't really claim to be too busy or too important to avoid responding (not that the other two do that either, they don't and that's what I like about them).  Since his arrival on the scene the web boards and newsgroups have been afire with questions.
<br><br>
To quote one of my favorite singers:  "Well there were cries of 'Why?' followed by cries of 'Why not?'."
<br><br>
The second we all thought we had Verant's ear turned towards us we began calling out.  An understandable response.  Abashi has done a pretty solid job responding to the flurry.  He's remained levelheaded, and his responses have been clear.  But, as could be expected, some people either don't understand the responses or just plain don't like them.  I can't address the people that just don't like them, except to say something harsh, like perhaps EverQuest just isn't your game.  And that's not the kind of thing that I like to say.  But I am interested in those that don't understand why Verant does some of the things that they do, even after a good explanation by Abashi.
<br><br>
So I want to look at one of the hottest topics, the removal or modification of items from the game.  I'm so intrigued by the whole thing.  In fact, I think that the consistency of 'stuff' in the game is one of its major flaws.  But let's start with the question and answer from Abashi that I swiped off of EQVault, though I think it originated on the official EverQuest message board (I've abbreviated the question significantly…):
<br><br>
<em><blockquote>What is the theory justifying removal of items from the game in the name of "game imbalance" but allowing those items to remain in the game for those who have already obtained the item?
<br><br>
Daia, High Priestess of the 30th Devotion of Quellious </em>
<br><br>
<em><b>We learned that except in the cases of extreme imbalance, we shouldn't take away items people have already earned. You mentioned below how you were looking forward to getting some items, and are now upset that you no longer have the chance to obtain them. I understand that, but imagine if you one day logged in and found an item that you worked for gone or no longer usable. 
<br><br>
It's really a question of the scope of the imbalance. We tried twice before to remove/modify items that people already had in game, and realized shortly afterwards that that was a mistake. In short, these items are imbalancing enough that they had to be removed. They were not imbalancing enough to justify removing them from thousands of people who had already earned them.</em></b></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
This makes perfect sense to me.  Here's something else that Abashi said, in response to someone else, I pulled this from alt.games.everquest (which it seems was clipped from Stratics...  ain't the net cool!):
<br><br>
<em><blockquote><b>"Let me see if I get this straight: You are saying that EQ isn't suited to roleplayers because you can't get some loot that someone else has?  Frankly, I'm afraid I don't agree. In fact, I can't see how one has anything to do with the other. I've always had a hard time explaining realism of an infinite numbers of items.
<br><br>
I don't think I'll be commenting further on the items removed thus far.  There's only so much I can say to explain it, and that's pretty well exhausted.
<br><br>
-Gordon" - Quoted from news item on eq.stratics.com</blockquote></em></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
This also makes perfect sense to me.  But to at least one fellow it didn't.  So maybe I can express it another way.
<br><br>
I play with a distant group of friends two or three times a year. They play what we would call a Monty Haul type game. We have a lot of fun, play several games over a weekend, and we split loot just as if the stuff we were getting would actually make it to the character sheet...
<br><br>
Then, on the way home, we talk about it and decide which stuff is too gross for our campaign and erase it off the character sheets.
<br><br>
Having the coolest loot is not what roleplaying is about. It is part of roleplaying, for sure. But if losing access to some item makes you mad enough to complain loudly on a newsgroup, then you're not a roleplayer, or you're a poorly focused roleplayer.
<br><br>
Taking items out of the game is not about fairness.  It's not about being unfair.  They are doing it because those items harm the game.  In our local campaign there are, I think, two scarabs of protection.  We consider these items very, very powerful.  In the world that my other friends play in every one has one, or more.  If suddenly everyone in our local game was sporting a vorpal sword, the entire dynamic of the game would change, and change in a way that would ruin it for most of us.  Think about this typical pen and paper situation:
<br><br>
A group of heroes goes out to slay the dragon that has been eating sheep, cows and farmers in a poor township. They expect no pay from the people of the town. They are heroes, after all. So they tromp off and kill the dragon. In the horde of treasure they find a Sword of Destroying Enemies and Slicing Warm Bread. This is by far the best weapon they've ever seen in the campaign. It is also the best weapon they will ever see in the future. The two warriors in the party are really pleased...
<br><br>
Until they realize that there are two of them. And they also notice that the ranger is fingering the pommel of the weapon.
<br><br>
Only one of them is going to get that weapon. Each of them has a chance at it, by whatever method the group uses to decide who gets it.  After that, there will be no more. Should the players complain to their GM?  Should they protest that they too should have that weapon?  And what about the other characters, the lower level ones that weren't able to go out and help slay the dragon that day?  Should they complain too?  Should the GM run that same game over and over again until all the warriors have the all-powerful Sword of Destroying Enemies and Slicing Warm Bread?
<br><br>
Nope.
<br><br>
In fact, it is because only one person will have that weapon that it is so special in that world.  It helps to mark the heroism that was displayed with the slaying of the dragon.
<br><br>
In EverQuest that game <b>will</b> be run over and over again.  And therefore it becomes not an event but a task.  And if you read the comments on the Internet you'll see people complaining that getting the good stuff is a chore.  Stuff in EverQuest has become pay for work done, not a memento of the completion of an exciting adventure.
<br><br>
Now this is at least partly the fault of the medium.  It is only in the static universe of video games that the idea that everyone should have everything comes up.
<br><br>
Part of the problem that I see here is that it's been this way for too long already.  People are naturally disagreeable to change.  Note the volume of complaints when even small things are changed, much less the big ones.  What should really have been done?  Things should have been changing from the day of release.  Old items should stop dropping and new ones should replace them.  This should happen all the time.  Nobody should come to expect that if you stand in this particular spot or kill this particular guy you will get this particular item.  Yes, some items should be on some enemies.  Finding a holy sword in the hands of a paladin (even if his faith isn't the same as yours) makes sense.  If there was a shield known and The Shield of Kane Bayle, then Kane darn well better have it.  But he should only have one.  Once a PC has it, he should carry around something else to block the strikes of his enemies.
<br><br>
If the standard state of the game had been that the game was always changing, then changes wouldn't be a problem...
<br><br>
I'm starting to ramble.  My points are these.
<br><br>
The game is too static.  Changing the items that are dropped is a good thing, it reduces the static.
<br><br>
And,
<br><br>
Abashi knows what he's talking about. Just because some folks feel somehow offended by what is right, doesn't make it wrong.  And it doesn't make him wrong.
<br><br>
Oh, hey, and I wanted to say that I hope we don't see any Christmas related events in Norrath.  Not only does Norrath not have a Christmas, but I would rather think that the Verant folks, GMs, Guides and Designers are at home enjoying the holiday rather than working.
<br><br>
And one more thing.  I'm done with my Christmas shopping!  WoooHoooo!
