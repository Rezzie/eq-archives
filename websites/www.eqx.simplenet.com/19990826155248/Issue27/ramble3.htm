Ironically, even though I wished everyone would talk like a Britannian, and
less like an American, I too used plain old English.  Hey, everyone else
was.  There was no point to roleplaying, since the atmosphere of the game
had already been put through a garbage disposal, sent down the sewer, and
had rotted away into nothingness.

So what's my point?  It's that I don't want EQ's already well-formed
atmosphere to go down the tubes like UO's did.  I'd personally love it if
everyone could at least talk sensibly, try to say things understandably,
spell things right, and, God forbid, roleplay a little and speak like an
ogre or mage or halfling or whatever they are.  It makes the game a lot more
interesting if everyone does that.  Really.  Honestly.  Besides, wouldn't you
rather go online and into Norrath than online and into just another giant 
graphical chatroom?  I know I would.

Regardless of what you think about what I've said, thank you for your time.
If you couldn't understand anything I said here, then I've turned into my own
pet peeve. :)
