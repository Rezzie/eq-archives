<b> -- Qeynos</b>
<br><br>
Antonius Bayle proclaimed this week to be "Lady Vox Week" as a show of respect to the ancient dragon whose birthday is this weekend.
<br><br>
As a gift, Bayle commissioned a scale model automated dragon from the Gnomes of Ak'anon, and ordered an enormous cake from Baker Pathar's of the East Commonlands (Baker Pathar's:  Weekday special: 2 Muffins for 5 copper. Pathar's--Where the Brave go to dine!).  The Qeynos militia is now asking for volunteers to deliver said gifts.
<br><br>
As yet there are no volunteers.
