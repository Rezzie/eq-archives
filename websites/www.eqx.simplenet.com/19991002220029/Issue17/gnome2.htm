I, of course, had to agree with them.

We decided that the three of us could defeat the snake and continue the search.  We
fabricated our plan of attack throughout the night.  It was settled we would head out
in the morning.

I was waked by a beam of radiate light shining upon my face from the solitary window
in my room.  My head ached from the ale, which had dehydrated my body.  But the
greedy adventurer within defeated the forces that compelled me to remain in bed.
I rolled from my rack, secured my gear, and headed out the door.

Standing in front of the tavern, which we decided to be our rally point, were the two
gnomes.  We exchanged brief hellos and started our quest.
<br><br>
It wasn’t long into the trip when the valley of forests and shrub changed to rock.
Ahead were the massive Everfrost Peaks. Further north, I noticed a cave at the base
of one of the mountain peaks. We reached the base of the peak.  A massive opening
into the mountain base could be seen clearly. The cave looked as though it had lain
empty for decades.  We entered.

 The corridor was twenty-foot wide leading north into the depths of the mountain. The
 walls and floor were perfectly smooth, masterfully carved from native rock. The
 ceiling appeared to be twenty-foot high, and made of cut and carved stone. Nether
 scent, sound, nor light gave away any clue as to what lied ahead in the unrelieved
 darkness. We lit our torches and proceeded on. After traveling south for several
 minutes we were confronted with our first obstacle. The corridor had emerged into a
 very large chamber; ahead there stood a ten-foot barrier, which blocked our access.
 The wall was embedded with spikes and barbs, which pointed down at an angle, This
 made climbing the wall difficult.   As we negotiated the wall I couldn’t help think
 I was in for some real trouble.  Someone spent a lot of time to keep unwelcome out.
