Hoi there all! Lrets D'pearl reporting here in good ol' Northern Ro ... the site of the 26th annual NASCARAB bug races! Hordes of people from all across the continent have been streaming into Freeport and the surrounding areas in preparation for this big event, and this is no surprise! Being as NASCARAB is the MOST popular spectator sport across all of Norrath! These races are charged with a level of energy no other sport could possibly convey. However, for once in my life I am at a loss for words to describe this awesome event ... so today I hand over my quill and let the announcer for this event (Who also happens to do the town square announcements and advertisements for the Monster Wagon events across Norrath) give you the low down on this event ... so ... without further ado ...
