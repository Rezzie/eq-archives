I can still see the look on my father's face when I told him where I'd been. The dried blood on my shirt and the dirt on my face were enough to convince my parents that their worst fears had been realized.
<br><br>
"You've made your choice," was all my father said upon hearing my story. "Don't expect us to like it." They turned away from me then, and I can still clearly see them walk away... My father's arm wrapped around my mother's shoulders, supporting her. That was the day of my first real battle, outside the practice room in the Defender's Hall. That was also the day I left home, and the last time I saw my parents.
<br><br>
I had been practicing with Master Tynkale, loyal follower of Tunare and noble Paladin, for two years. My parents had no idea, and for good reason! My mother was an enchantress, a beautiful high elf who viewed swordfighting as a taboo topic in our household. My father, a war wizard, I thought would understand. I thought he'd understand the thrill of battle and the feeling of accomplishment when standing over the latest kill; one less creature of evil on the face of Norrath.
<br><br>
I was wrong. For two years I kept my secret lessons with Tynkale just that... a secret. I would change into the robe of an apprentice cleric, and always act as a proper healer should. My parents both knew I had no desire to follow in their footsteps and become a true spell-caster, but they had convinced me that the life of a cleric was where I belonged. I agreed, for a time. My lessons went well and I quickly learned the basic healing spells required... but soon, I craved more.
<br><br>
That's when I met Tynkale. I was sitting at the edge of the Felwithe pond, letting my feet dangle in the water. In my mind I was fighting great dragons and giants such as I had heard of from the many adventurers that stopped within our city. Just as I was about to deal the dragon the final blow, a hand touched my shoulder, startling me. I looked up, and Master Tynkale watched me with a peculiar smile, as if he could read my thoughts. I had often seen him in the city, and have heard great stories of his triumphs in battle and dedication to Tunare, but I had never spoken to him before.
<br><br>
"Come," was all he said, and motioned for me to follow. He led us into the Defender's Hall, and from there into a large room. Many different types of armor lay against the walls, as well as a variety of weapons.
<br><br>
I glanced questioningly at Tynkale, and he smiled back. "Go ahead... pick one," he said.
<br><br>
I looked at each, one by one, and finally made my choice. I picked up a Fine Steel Two-Handed Sword and held it high up in the air.
<br><br>
"A fine choice," he said. "But put it back. This will be yours." He threw me a wooden sword that I caught with my left hand and glanced at in disgust. He must have seen my look, for he shook his head and told me I had a lot to learn.
<br><br>
Two years later, I still wasn't using the Fine Steel Two-Handed Sword... but I had been given a one-handed rusty sword. One day, I was allowed to practice my skills outside of the safe city walls of Felwithe. Master Tynkale did not wish to go with me... He just said this was something I had to do on my own.
<br><br>
I walked out slowly, and tentatively past the two guards outside the city gates. I had never been out this far on my own. A decaying skeleton stood just outside of the Guard's line of sight, staring at me, with a mocking expression on his bony face. Without hesitating, I charged into battle! My first blow caught the skeleton in the shoulder, and that was soon followed by another, which this time grazed his jaw! The tables turned quickly, however. The skeleton's bony fist dealt me a few swift hits, all landing square in my ribs. I collapsed to the ground, unconscious. I heard Tunare's call, and prepared to follow it. Suddenly I was back on my feet, surrounded by a faint blue light that I recognized to be a healing spell cast upon me. My wounds were healing fast and every warrior instinct and technique I had learned in the past two years suddenly came to my mind. I used all my strength to swing my sword high above my head and bring it down upon the decaying skeleton. It fell to my feet in a heap of bones, and I too fell, exhausted, to my knees.
<br><br>
"Ah, fellow Paladin," a voice said. "Be careful out here. This land is dangerous for one so young." I looked up and could barely make out the face of a beautiful High Elf, wearing bronze armor! I had met another paladin!
<br><br>
"Thank you..." I mumbled, when I realized she had been the one who saved my life.
<br><br>
She smiled, and handed me a ring. "Here, take this. It's not much, but it will help you in your travels." I looked down upon the ring that had been placed in my hand, and recognized it as a Cutthroat Insignia Ring just like the one Tynkale wore! I asked about it once, and I was told it has the magical ability to add to the wearer's dexterity, and was also able to provide some protection from the crushing blow of one's enemies. I glanced up to thank the kind paladin, but she was gone. The ache in my head was unbearable, and I wondered if she had ever been there at all. I slipped the ring upon my finger and rose to my feet. I had only enough strength to walk to the guards and collapse by the fire they keep eternally burning. I fell asleep with a wide grin on my face. That night, I dreamt of battling evil dragons and monstrous giants.
