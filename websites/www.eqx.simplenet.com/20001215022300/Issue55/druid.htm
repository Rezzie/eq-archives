<p style="text-align: justify">


The sun was just rising over the horizon when Aklar, Druid of the 9th level, struck camp.  Her belongings neatly stowed in her backpack, she performed her daily ritual of thanks to Tunare, and was on her way.  The flat plains of Western Karana stretched out around her for miles. In the distance she saw a pride of lions bounding along, and altered her path to skirt wide around them.  Druids lived in harmony with all of nature, but she had been forced to kill a young lioness that had attacked her yesterday, and feared the smell of its blood would enrage these.  Her heart hurt for the animal's death, but she knew, too, that Tunare would understand.  The law of nature was survival of the fittest, and the wildlife of Western Karana was not as friendly as the bears of Surefall Glade.
<br><br>
Her duties here were wearing on her.  The bears and wolves here were not friendly at all.  They were as willing to attack as the lions.  And the few treants she had come across were barely willing to acknowledge her presence.  She was never going to make the 10th level in this barren place.
<br><br>
Ahead of her there rose a small hill, its sides scoured bare by the ever-present winds of the plains.  A ways up there was a camp of a few tents, arranged in a circle.  Fires sent smoke up into the sky, and a welcome smell of cooking came to Aklar.  Her own store of food was low, and she turned her steps toward the tents, hoping for hospitality, or at least the chance to trade healing for food.  One of her spells, learned on her achievement of the 5th level, could cure disease, always in demand with the high incidence of rabies.
<br><br>
But as she approached the foot of the hill, Aklar felt a blow from behind that staggered her and sent a jolt of pain through her right shoulder. She spun, dropping into a defensive stance, and freeing her warhammer from the thong at her waist.  Before her stood a human man, dressed in full leather armor, his fists clenched and a nasty scowl on his face.
<br><br>
"Surely we can discuss this," Aklar began, and he drew back his fist and punched her in the face.  Her head snapped back and she almost went sprawling.  The rage that the Druid Masters had so shaken their heads over welled up in her, and she flung herself at the man with a scream of rage.  Her warhammer whistled through the air, landing with a solid thump on the man's right arm, driving him sideways.  As he staggered, she began the gestures and as he righted himself, an explosion of fire burst in the air about him.  He beat out the flames frantically, and she advanced on him again, hammer held high.
<br><br>
She was beating the aggression out of the misguided wanderer in quite satisfactory manner, when a <b>second</b> attack from behind took her by surprise.  A sword whistled through the air where her head had been a second ago, and she whirled to see another leather clad man, this time half-elven, coming at her with grim intent written clearly on his otherwise quite handsome features.  She backed up, eyes moving from one attacker to the other.  Cursing her bad luck, she prepared to go down fighting.  They rushed her.
<br><br>
It was no good.  She managed to finish off her original attacker, but the other was much stronger, much better trained in battle, and she was already tired and wounded. Her breath coming in harsh pants, her strength fading, she was preparing her soul for Tunare's embrace, when a wash of blue light flooded about her, and she felt herself revived.
<br><br>
"Hurry and kill him!"  A High Elf was standing at her side, wielding a great staff with enthusiasm, if not much skill.  "Their camp is just up the hill."  The two of them put down the half-elf without much trouble, and looting the bodies quickly, left the hill behind them as fast as they could.
<br><br>
Looking sideways at her companion as they ran, Aklar sized him up.  Not much older than her, he seemed frail, but that could be only because of his race.  Other than the staff, he carried little equipment, and seemed ill-prepared for such a foray into the sparsely populated Karanas.  His lean face held the look of hard travel, however, a kind of wind-worn weariness that marred his Elven good looks only a little.
<br><br>
"Thank you," she said.  "You saved my life."
<br><br>
"It is my calling," he answered with a winning smile. "I AM a cleric, after all."  Perhaps it marred them not at all.  When he smiled...
<br><br>
"I didn't know that people out here were quite so unwelcoming.  I only wished to purchase food."
<br><br>
He stopped in his tracks, and she paused, looking inquiringly at him.  He stared at her as if not sure what he had heard.
<br><br>
"You aren't, that is to say, I saw you use magic, so...You couldn't by any chance be a Rogue?" he asked almost diffidently.
<br><br>
"A Rogue!" Aklar repeated, offended to her toes. "No, by Tunare.  I am a Druid," she said proudly. "A Druid of the 9th level."
<br><br>
"Take no offense, I only meant...well, only rogues tend to go to the bandits camp by themselves."
<br><br>
"Bandit camp," she repeated, feeling a little faint and quite stupid.  "I thought they were further south."
<br><br>
"No, no, that was it.  Back there.  That you almost wandered into like a lost kitten."  A smile grew on his face and turned into a laugh before he hid it with a cough and a raised hand.
<br><br>
She turned and began walking with slow dignity West.
<br><br>
The cleric caught up with her within three strides.
<br><br>
"My apologies, Druid.  Rude of me to mock another's ignorance."  He sounded truly ashamed of himself, and she  glanced at him and nodded.  "I am Anthiel, Cleric of the 8th level, from Felwithe."
<br><br>
"I am Aklar." She clasped his arm in greeting.  "What is one from so far to the east doing wandering the Karanas?  Not but that you seem to be better informed than I about the area," she added ruefully.
<br><br>
"I only know the look of bandits.  I can recognize a camp.  A friend of mine is in Qeynos," he answered.  "I am to meet him there and then go to join the fight in BlackBurrow."
<br><br>
Aklar's upper lip curled before she could restrain herself.  "That foul pit of Tunare-abandoned poachers? I have been there. It is a good thing you do, Cleric Anthiel.  The Gnolls have become most aggressive of late.  They trouble us even in Surefall.  Mammoth herself has been assaulted."  Aklar grasped her hammer in anger at the desecration.
<br><br>
"Mammoth?" inquired Anthiel.
<br><br>
Startled, she looked at him, and then flushed red.  To speak of Druid mysteries in front of an uninitiated!  Te'anara would have some sharp words to say if she had heard.  Aklar cursed her flapping tongue.  She would never make the 10th level if she did not learn self control.
<br><br>
"Again, my apologies, Druid Aklar, I have intruded where I had no right."  The Elf bowed before her.
<br><br>
"No, it was my indiscretion.  You have no fault in it. Though I would ask that you not mention it again, to me or anyone else." 
<br><br>
He bowed again.
<br><br>
"Of course, Druid.  We are, after all, battlemates."  He smiled.
<br><br>
"Yes," Aklar smiled back.  "Please, as you will, call me Aklar."
<br><br>
"It is my honor.  And you, call me Anthiel."
<br><br>
"Honor to me," Aklar replied formally, with a broader smile.  Those who called the High Elves smug and full of themselves must simply never have met one.
<br><br>
"If I may ask," he began, "where are we going?"
<br><br>
"To Qeynos Hills pass," she answered, a little surprised.  "Weren't you going to Qeynos?"
<br><br>
"Yes... but I lost the path after encountering you, and I am now entirely lost. Glad I am to hear you are not so."  He laughed.
<br><br>
"I shall take you to the city gates themselves," she said.  "As thanks for your most timely assistance."
<br><br>
"Then it is I who shall be in your debt," he said, and smiled warmly.
<br><br>
Aklar looked away, her heart beating a little quicker.  Truly, the man was beautiful.  She had heard of the elegance and grace of High Elves, and now the truth made the stories pale in comparison.
<br><br>
"Perhaps, if your friend would not mind, that is... I have been to Black Burrow and could be of use." 
<br><br>
"I would be pleased to have you join us," he answered.  "Friends can be hard to find so far from home."
<br><br>
Aklar inclined her head.  Te'anara could not protest her going to Black Burrow this time.  She was much more experienced, ready for the challenge.  And others could patrol the Karanas with the treants.   It was a worthy service, but beyond boring at times.  Treants were noble, honorable, blessed of Tunare, but hardly scintillating conversationalists.  Besides, she would like to know more of the High Elves.  Only a fool passed up the opportunity to learn.  Anthiel was very...interesting.
<br><br>
They traversed the pass without incident and made their way through the Hills without stopping.  Twice they passed other adventurers fighting wolves, but Aklar averted her gaze and kept on past them.  Holly and Cros were the fanatics, not her.  She felt disgust, but it was not her place to teach others the way to Tunare, especially not at the end of a weapon.  
<br><br>
Quickly the two found themselves at the gates of Qeynos.
<br><br>
"Where were you to meet with your friend?" Aklar asked.  Anthiel was scanning the surrounding countryside, searching the face of everyone entering or exiting Qeynos.
<br><br>
"Here," he said absently. "We were to meet before the gates..."  He trailed off, taking two steps toward a figure approaching along the path. 
<br><br>
"Anthiel!" boomed the barbarian, throwing massive arms around the slim Elf.
<br><br>
"Freygar!" gasped Anthiel, struggling to free his arms and return the embrace.  The barbarian dropped him to the ground, and approached Aklar.
<br><br>
"Dare I hope this blossom accompanies you?" Freygar bowed deeply before her.  Aklar's mouth quirked in an amused grin.
<br><br>
"May I present Aklar, Druid of the 9th level.  She has graciously agreed to come with us to Black Burrow."  Anthiel smiled at her.  Aklar pushed her shoulders back and cocked a hip under the barbarian's gaze, returning it with a slow head to toe perusal that had him straightening his back.
<br><br>
"My honor," she said, and bowed before him.  This could prove an interesting journey, indeed.
<br><br>
"Did I say blossom? A peach, in truth, friend Anthiel.  My name is Freygar, milady Druid.  A warrior of the 10th level."  His smile was anything but formal.
<br><br>
"Well," said Anthiel hurriedly.  "We have provisions to buy, Freygar, so..."
<br><br>
"Good, good!  I have saved enough to finally buy some chainmail!  So we will part and meet here again in an hour?  Good!"  The huge man strode off without awaiting assent.
<br><br>
"He is a tad overwhelming, but good of heart," said Anthiel, looking at her with a wry smile.
<br><br>
"Indeed," answered Aklar absently, her eyes following the tall form.
<br><br>
"Well," said Anthiel again, and cleared his throat.  Aklar wrenched her eyes back around.  "Perhaps we should look to the provisions?"
<br><br>
"Of course," Aklar put an arm around the Elf's shoulders and guided him in through the gates.  "I suggest we let me do the purchasing.  The shopkeeps know me well and I can no doubt get a better price than you."
<br><br>
Anthiel trailed after her as she purposefully made her way into the city.  She would go to Black Burrow, and serve Tunare so well that she would doubtless be made level 10 inside of a week.  Te'anara herself would be impressed.  Perhaps she would even get to guard Mammoth! It was not beyond comprehension.  Bren, that simpering cat, could not hold Te'anara's favor forever.  And even if not...Aklar's mouth curved up in a smile.  Travelling with two such men could not but prove...interesting.
<br><br>
It was night before they met again, Freygar now attired in a handsome chainmail shirt.  Aklar wondered to herself how he had managed to accumulate wealth so quickly.  The man was scarcely older than herself.  It was not polite to pry and so she kept her wondering to herself.  She gave his shirt a few sideways glances until she realized he thought she was admiring him.  He inflated his chest every time her eyes fell on him.  She pulled her eyes away, biting back a laugh.  Truly, men were most amusing to have around.
<br><br>
"Ready?" she asked, and without waiting for an answer, turned and ran off into the night.
<br><br>
The three of them soon left the glow of the city behind, moving with the ground-eating lope of the experienced adventurer.  They were into the Hills and halfway to Surefall when Aklar veered off the path and cut cross-country toward BlackBurrow.  Fear began to worm in her guts, but she pushed it firmly down.  She had been too young, and a fool besides, when she had been there last.  She had learned from her mistakes.  She hoped.
<br><br>
Too soon, a yellow glow rose ahead of her, and she slowed to a walk.  Her companions caught up and she raised a finger to her lips.
<br><br>
"You have been here before, Freygar?" she asked quietly.
<br><br>
"Once, though not for long," he answered in the same hushed tone.
<br><br>
"Watch yourselves," she cautioned.  "There are scouts and watchers all over these hills."
<br><br>
They avoided notice, and slipped into the yawning mouth of the tunnel without incident.  A wolf howled somewhere in the night, and Aklar shivered, not in fear this time, but anticipation.  Let the Elders say what they might, battle was where she belonged.  
<br><br>
"Anthiel, you stay back as much as possible.  You are here to keep us alive.  Freygar and I will handle the fighting."  Freygar grinned at her, eyes lit with excitement.
<br><br>
"Nothing like bloodshed to make you feel alive, eh little sister?" His teeth showed alarmingly through his smile.  She returned it, feeling a wolf stirring inside her.  Anthiel laughed quietly, adrenaline turning it edgy and a little wild.  The tunnel walls reflected their lights, shadows dancing erratically. Aklar took a deep breath and rounded the final bend.
<br><br>
BlackBurrow itself was quiet.  Ominously so.  No Gnolls on the surface at all.  Aklar could smell blood in the air.  She paused, head shifting warily, eyes searching, and then padded cautiously out of the entrance.  Her two companions followed, weapons drawn, faces tight.
<br><br>
"It's too quiet," began Anthiel, when he was interrupted by a shout.  
<br><br>
"TRAIN!" yelled the wild-eyed half-elven Ranger as he catapulted from the tunnel.  Half a dozen others followed him up, and behind them...
<br><br>
Twenty or more Gnolls poured from the tunnel like a green and gray tide of death, howling for blood and waving any number of various weapons.  One human woman, a wizard by her robes, was pulled under and cut to pieces before Aklar could blink.  Then the fleeing people were rushing past her.
<br><br>
"Hold!" she cried. "Hold and we can stand against them!"  The adventurers hit the wall behind her and turned, like wolves at bay.  Then the Gnolls were on them, snapping and snarling like crazed dogs.
<br><br>
She fought grimly, as if her hammer could keep death from her if it rose and fell fast enough.  Time slowed, and Gnolls leapt toward her and fell beneath her strokes as if in slow motion.  Twice the cooling wash of blue light swept around her, healing her wounds and clearing the fatigue of overused muscles.  She saw Anthiel fall out of the corner of her eye, and snatched a precious moment in between a Gnoll commander's blows to cast her own, less effective healing.  Anthiel staggered up and got his back against a wall.  Freygar was in the thick of it, exchanging blows with no less than three Gnolls, one a commander.  She tore herself loose from the fight, saw her opponent turn on a mage and back up to where Anthiel leaned gasping against the stone.
<br><br>
"Are you all right?" she panted.  He nodded, not speaking.  "Can you heal me again?"  He raised weary arms and performed the gestures.  Feeling her strength surge, she nodded, and then pushed him toward the exit tunnel.  "Go! You cannot help us anymore!"  He stumbled away with a stricken look and then paused, glancing back at her.
<br><br>
"What do you mean to do?"  
<br><br>
"GO!" she shouted and he turned away and broke into a shambling run.  She turned toward the fight.  Freygar was flagging, his sword rising and falling more slowly now, his face twisted with determination.  Others fared no better.  Three were down and there were aborted flashes of light as spells were interrupted. They could not stand.  The Gnolls were too strong, too many.  Everyone was going to die here.  Her mana was almost gone, only enough left for one spell.  But maybe, maybe she could buy time.  Aklar cleared her mind, raised her arms, and called on Tunare to help her.  The walls of the tunnel flickered, and then  lightning bolts flashed down into the massed Gnolls, each one striking gray-furred flesh.  They howled louder than before, and almost as a mass turned toward her.  Some fell, struck dead by her magic, but too many were left to deal with.
<br><br>
"Oh, shit," she whispered, her knees going weak.  They were between her and the exit.  They came at her, and she gulped a breath and went to meet them at a run.  As they crashed into her, she leapt, using a commander's shoulder to help her up, and did a forward roll over their tightly packed backs.  Swords and scythes cut into her, and clubs beat at her legs, but she landed on her feet and sprinted for the door.  A mass of people blocked the exit for a minute and then they were through.  She staggered to a stop against the wall and then slid down it, her wounds on fire and her head aching.  They wouldn't follow, she knew.  Gnolls had an almost superstitious fear of the outside world, except for the adventuresome few that volunteered for scouting.  
<br><br>
Freygar grasped her shoulders and set her on her feet.  She winced in pain, but he hardly noticed, enfolding her in a hug that would have staggered a hill giant.  She gasped, eyes popping, as the last of her breath left her lungs.
<br><br>
"Well done!" he boomed deafeningly.  The others from inside Black Burrow surrounded her, patting her back and laughing.  "You saved my life! I owe you a great debt, Druid Aklar!"  She was going to go deaf.  Anthiel stood slowly, and began casting healing on everyone, one at a time.  People lost their wild-eyed looks and began congratulating each other on their survival.  The blue flickers of healing began to glow around several of the combatants.  Others sat and meditated.  Aklar got an arm free and pounded on Freygar's shoulder.
<br><br>
"Let me down," she demanded testily.  He set her down as if she was made of glass, and bowed gravely before her.
<br><br>
"As you command, milady," he mocked her gently.  She sat down abruptly, and glared at him, daring him to laugh.
<br><br>
"They were not this bad before," said the half-elf Ranger, shaking his head.  "They were not so numerous.  They have begun breeding like vermin."
<br><br>
"They <b>are</b> vermin," snapped a petite half-elven warrior, binding her wounds with angry jerks.  "They are planning something.  I know it.  Why else would they need such numbers?"
<br><br>
"Someone must tell Antonius Bayle."  The monk stood and solemnly surveyed the crowd.  'He will know what to do."
<br><br>
"Antonius Bayle," muttered Aklar.  "He cannot even keep his guards uncorrupted unless they are under his eyes.  What can he do?"
<br><br>
"Someone must be told."  Anthiel looked around.  
<br><br>
Aklar stood.  "I must go to Surefall and tell the Elders of the Glade.  Te'anara must know of this."  Freygar and Anthiel came up to her, opening their mouths, and she raised a hand.  "Alone.  I will meet you at the cottage in the hills in two nights."  They nodded and she sat down to meditate for a minute.  She felt mana slowly flow into her, like a whisper of wind through trees.  When she had enough, she rose again, and cast her spell without pause.  Grey-silver shimmering balls rose from the ground at her, feet, a great globe of silver light encased her, and she round herself before the entrance to Surefall.  Squaring her shoulders, she entered.  The familiar twisting tunnel took her into the quiet glade, with its tall trees and quiet pool.  She acknowledged the greetings of the Rangers and Druids without really seeing them. The huge tree that housed the Druid's guild hall loomed before her, and she paused to collect her thoughts.  Te'anara probably thought she was still in the Karanas.  Not that Druids took orders, exactly, but it had been strongly suggested that she watch over the bears there.  A matter of learning patience, Te'anara had said.  Well, she was patient.  The lesson had been learned.  Te'anara could not fault her, not when she brought such important news.  Aklar took a deep breath, and entered.
