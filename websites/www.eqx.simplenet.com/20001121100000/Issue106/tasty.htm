<big><b>THE BALLAD OF THE TASTY BARD</big></b>

<p style="text-align: justify">

<br>


The group was joined, five stalwarts all,<br>
A cleric and a wizard tall,<br>
Two paladins for close melee.<br>
What's that?  Oh yeah.  The bard was me.
<br><br>
To Blackburrow our leader led.<br>
Down ramps, round turns, our leader sped.<br>
This speed, thought I, is passing rash.<br>
He zigged, I zagged.  Look OUT!  Ker-SPLASH.
<br><br>
The water here is deep and cold.<br>
At least there are no pesky gnolls<br>
My tender skin to rip and slash.<br>
Yee-OUCH!  Some FISH just bit my ash!
<br><br>
Drag, drag, drag my corpse, slowly back to shore.<br>
Rejoice, rearm, rejoin my group.  I'm ready for some more.
<br><br>
Now follow me!  our leader said.<br>
Down ramps, cross spans, our leader sped.<br>
You know, this speed's not so appalling.<br>
Oops!  Spoke too soon.  Now here's me falling.
<br><br>
Ker-SPLASH.  Again I've hit the drink.<br>
Which way is out?  I've got to think.<br>
But wait, I see no fish to rend me.<br>
I can relax, need not defend me.
<br><br>
Ah, here's a ledge.  My search is ended.<br>
Uh-oh, this ledge is gnoll-defended.<br>
Quick.  Jump back in the water cold.<br>
Yee-OUCH!  What's this?  Aquatic gnolls?
<br><br>
Drag, drag, drag my corpse, slowly back to shore.<br>
Rejoice, rearm, rejoin my group.  Let's even up the score.
<br><br>
Beneath the bridge my party stands<br>
Their weapons ready in their hands.<br>
I sing my song and then start strumming.<br>
Our leader gives a shout, "Incoming!"
<br><br>
All at once, there's gnolls aplenty.<br>
Maybe ten or maybe twenty.<br>
I think our leader's gone insane.<br>
He went and pulled a freaking train!
<br><br>
Gnoll commander, elite guardsman,<br>
Patrolling gnoll, and gnoll shaman.<br>
This fight's a riot, not a melee!<br>
Hey! How come these gnolls all pick on me?
<br><br>
Loot, loot, loot my corpse.  This story must be told.<br>
Return, rearm, rejoin my group.  The price of being bold.
<br><br>
Beneath the bridge my party fights,<br>
Headlong, I rush to aid their plight.<br>
They're only fighting three or four...<br>
By Bristle's balls!  Here come some more!
<br><br>
My blood is spilling on the ground.<br>
Can it be wise to stick around?<br>
"RUN,"  someone yells, "without delay!"<br>
That's fine, I think, but - uh - which way?
<br><br>
Blackburrow is a twisty maze<br>
Of tunnels and dark narrow ways.<br>
Headlong, I race around a bend.<br>
Headlong... into a dark DEAD end.
<br><br>
Loot, loot, loot my corpse.  It's really getting old.<br>
Repent, rearm, rejoin my group.  I'm tired of being bold.
<br><br>
'Neath the bridge my party paces,<br>
Eager smiles upon their faces.<br>
While I've respawned they've had to wait.<br>
You can't pull gnolls without the bait.
<br><br>
This time, though, you can be certain<br>
With death no more will I be flirtin'.<br>
This time I've learned the fastest route<br>
Through Blackburrow for getting OUT!
<br><br>
So now I know my way around,<br>
My corpses shall not ere be found.<br>
As sure as my name's Kianel,<br>
When things get tough, I'll run like HELL!
