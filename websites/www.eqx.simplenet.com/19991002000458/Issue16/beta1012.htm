Be suicidal.  Don't be afraid to die.  They will be resetting our characters
throughout various phases of beta testing anyway.  Jump off that cliff.  Slide
down the steepest hill.  Climb every tree.  This is the best way to find
places you might get stuck.  If we find them now, we're less like to get
upset if we get stuck in the real game.

PK.  Yes I know this is a heated debate, and some people do not like Player
Killers and some wouldn't play the game without it.  However, the bottom
line is Player vs Player combat is an excellent way to test the balance
between the races and classes.  Even if you don't fight to the death, at
least test your strength vs a character of similar level.  If it turns out
you consistently get your butt kicked, and others that share your selections
do too, then the balance can be tweaked to help even things out.

Share.  Find the best equipment, and tell everybody!  This may not be the
best way to make yourself into a superior killing force, but we need to
know if there is equipment that is definitely the best, and everyone will
get.  If so, the price must be right, or the stats modified.  Everyone will
figure it out eventually, but in beta testing, speeding up the game tweaks
is beneficial to everyone.  Most importantly, though, a variety of equipment
and lots of choice will make the game more interesting and, of course, fun.
<br><br>
Experiment.  Try casting every spell on everything you see.  Can you heal
the furniture you attacked earlier?  Will the NPCs kill you if you cast
an enchantment on them?  Try out your skills in the same way.

Powerup!  Ideally Sony will give beta testers big chunks of exp in order
to test out the higher levels.  Be sure to get as much exp as you possibly
can.  It may be a while before someone in the real game gets that high,
but better to find out now if it works right.

Work together.  Get everyone online to crowd into the same Tavern.  It
might not smell so good, but maxing out areas and pushing things to the
limit like this is a good way to test the stability of the system.
<br><br>
Be creative.  Come up with your own ideas not mentioned here to try out.
With all the beta testers thinking outside the norm, we'll be much more
likely to catch the problems that will arise when the gates open and
floods of newbies come streaming into the game.  Remember, beta test is
meant for this, and the real game is where the true fun begins.  The
most important thing to remember, fellow testers, is that the quicker we
solve the problems, the quicker the game will open!
