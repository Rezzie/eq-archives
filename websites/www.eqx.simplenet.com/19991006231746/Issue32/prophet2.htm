"You see anything, elf?"
<br><br>
	The fabric of Edril's cloak rippled in hot, southern winds.  His hood was pulled far over his eyes to protect them from the sun, and his face was hidden in shadow.  "I'm not sure," he answered back as he surveyed the road before him with narrowed eyes.  Craning his neck upwards, the elf inhaled deeply and choked on wind-swept sands.  "But there is something here," he cleared his throat and continued, "something in the air."
<br><br>
	Aryn, the head of the merchant escort Edril had been awarded, trailed the elf by the length of five horses.  He rode next to the second wagon in the caravan of eight, and no other guards were permitted to ride past him.  Across his back was strapped a thick, northern sword and a wicked bow hung from the side of his saddle.  His face, brown from long exposure to the desert sun, was covered with red hair.  "Ro creatures?" he called to Edril in his deep voice.  "Giants maybe?"
<br><br>
	"No."  Edril look across the barren desert horizon once more before reigning his horse around.  Lowering his hood so that Aryn could hear him better, he ran a hand through his silvery hair which was clotted from sweat and sand.  "Something else.  I smell steel."
<br><br>
	Aryn raised a thick eyebrow.  "You see tracks?"
<br><br>
	"I thought I did, over the dunes to the northwest."
<br><br>
	With an expression Edril could only interpret as profound fear, as much as barbarians can possibly show fear, Aryn raised his right arm and turned toward the back of the company.  "Tracker!" he yelled and his guards echoed the command all the way to the caravan's end.  In a matter of seconds a dark skinned man riding a black horse found his way to Aryn from six wagons back.  The man's body was covered in runic tatoos Edril found vaguely familiar.  "You are the tracker?" Aryn asked.
<br><br>
	The man nodded.  "Yees, trackar, yees."
<br><br>
	"<em>Dol Kaglim gleshakarn grami ugorniem</em>," Aryn's voice inflected in a way Edril knew was awkward for him.  The barbarian pointed where the elf had referred to and continued instructing the tracker.  "<em>Gerk tar dol treh-ferz al gleshak bumh kum uzk</em>."
<br><br>
	The tracker nodded again, whispered something in the ear of his horse, and started with great speed towards the northwestern dunes.  His horse kicked up clouds of dust with each powerful stride.
<br><br>
	The elf, watching the tracker travel farther and farther from the safety of the caravan, reigned in close to Aryn.  "What language was that?"
<br><br>
	"Hmmm?"  the barbarian's attention was still on his tracker.
<br><br>
	"The language you just spoke, what was it?"
<br><br>
	"<em>Zarki-Torashi</em>.  Loosely means 'dark tongue' in common speech.  It's the language of the ogres and later the trolls.  Now most of the villages and human tribes around the oasis speak it too. That's where my tracker is from, the oasis of Marr."  The barbarian grinned.  "I'm surprised, elf.  You mapped most of these territories and you don't know the language?"
<br><br>
	"The name, northerner, is Edril, and I never stayed long in the oasis camps."
<br><br>
	"Alright, alright."  Aryn's grin suddenly vanished and he cast a short glance behind him.  "Well, Edril," he spoke in a hushed voice, "you've got me worried me now.  Something isn't right about this whole thing."
<br><br>
	The elf turned his head slightly.  "What do you mean?"
<br><br>
	"You know I trust your instincts.  Steel and tracks?  Sounds like raiders to me, but…"
<br><br>
	"Scared?"  Edril looked back to where the tracker had vanished.
<br><br>
	The barbarian growled and pounded his chest with a clenched fist.  "Never!  A warrior of Halas is always ready to die."
<br><br>
	"Then what's the problem?"
<br><br>
	Aryn lowered his arm and looked to the sky.  "This is too far north.  The other caravans were hit miles more to the south.  I had hoped to be close to the oasis in case we needed reinforced escort, but if the raiders are in fact here then reinforcements are also out of the question."  The barbarian shook his head.  "It also means these are nomadic raiders, something I have never seen before.  Most bandits will set up permanent hidden camps to sell goods and slaves.  If these bandits are moving, that means they are moving with something.  And this means they are supplying something."
<br><br>
	Edril nodded his agreement.  "Good points, but ultimately they are for John to think about.  Remember the mission, we are to find the bandits and then kill the bandits.  Anything else is not our concern."
<br><br>
	The two men both turned their attention back to the northwest in quiet expectation.  The caravan fell deathly silent as the desert winds howled over the white hills of Ro.  A long time after, Aryn waved and laughed when he saw the faint outline of his tracker's horse appear again on the sand dunes.  "See," the barbarian smiled, "nothing to worry about."  The elf's eyes, however, told him a different tale.  Edril noticed the tracker was moving towards the caravan at much greater speeds, and he saw panic etched across the man's face.  Even Aryn's expression steadily became grim as his tracker drew more close.  
<br><br>
	When the tatooed man had almost ridden over the elf and barbarian, he jerked his horse to a stop and began talking rapidly.  "<em>Shagdukim</em>," he managed to say between long breaths of exhaustion, "<em>urkilimen uzdug dol motri.  Kum uzkarn gath Shali-Barukim</em>."
<br><br>
	Aryn growled and turned his horse to face the caravan, speaking with a sidelong glance to Edril.  "He says they were trolls beyond the hills on mounts, what the people of the oasis call 'flame-walkers', horrible desert lizards that raiders love to use.  So much for nothing to worry about."  The barbarian turned his eyes again to the tracker.  "<em>Bumh dumin al borh uzkarn kum gerk</em>?"
<br><br>
	The tracker looked completely flushed and pale when he answered.  "<em>Ug ogdukin shagduki ugalki.  Kum uzk gerk nash garoh...</em>"
<br><br>
	"<em>GOR</em>!?" Aryn surprised even Edril with the intensity of his voice.  The tracker held up two fingers.  "What in the nine hells!?," Aryn unstrapped his sword with clenched teeth and held it high above his head.  The sunlight glittered off the blade.  "Soldiers!  First formation around every corner on the wagons! Archers group in center with arrows in the ground!  NOW!"  His voice reached every part of the caravan and guards from both inside and outside the wagons began unsheathing weapons and stringing bows.
<br><br>
	"Aryn," asked a perplexed Edril, "what's going on?  What did he say?"
<br><br>
	The barbarian lowered his blade and turned his head.  "They've been playing with us.  Ten trolls on ten desert mounts, easily enough to wipe out a normal caravan, not only are close by but they have been watching us.  They have completed circles around the entire caravan at least twice, waiting for the right time and place to strike."
<br><br>
	"By the gods!" Edril reached for the elongated handle of his own curved sword.  The thin, single edged blade slid out from it's sheath with a hiss of metal on leather.  "What's the plan now?"
<br><br>
	"The plan," Aryn began with fire in his eyes, "is we fight to the death."
<br><br>
	Screaming to the desert sky, Aryn lashed the reins on his horse fiercely and rode to stand next to his archer line.  Edril and the tracker followed close behind him.
<br><br>
	The guard organization around the wagons wasn't different from any other regular caravan protection with one exception.  Every archer John could spare from the commonlands, Aryn had positioned in the center.  Not too worried about loosing the worthless caravan cargo, the barbarian hoped to draw his enemies into one specific point and trap them with greater numbers.  The rest of the guards wore full sets of leather armor and each had a standard long sword.  Taking one look up and down the edges of the wagons, Aryn nodded his satisfaction and looked to the horizon.
<br><br>
	For a minute there was nothing.  Not even the wind seemed to blow in that brief moment of hesitation, but then the sound of thunder shook the ground beneath the wagons.  Black figures, outlined by the cloudless sky, appeared one after another on the tip of an eastern sand dune.  Each was easily thirteen feet tall, the thick bodies of green skinned trolls riding tall, lizard-like creatures with long tails, flat bodies, and armor plated skin.  All of the soldiers held jagged spears at their sides.  In the middle of them all rode one particular troll, a jeweled helmet placed over his ears and a large scimitar in his hands, which barked orders to the rest.
<br><br>
	"I count ten."  Edril said quietly.
<br><br>
	Aryn nodded.  "Confident bastards.  They've thrown strategy to the winds.  We've stopped and now they're going to ride us down in a single charge.  Guards!  Right side!"  soldiers from all over the caravan jumped into one line facing the raiders.  "Archers!" Aryn continued.  "Get your bows ready and fire when I give the signal."  Each archer drew one arrow from the sand and readied it in their bow.  "If you have a god, elf," the barbarian grinned, "I'd start praying."
<br><br>
	The troll commander screamed one word and with terrible war cries echoing from everywhere in the desert of Ro, the ten trolls thundered down the sand dunes at lightning speed.  Their spears were aimed directly for the caravan guards.
<br><br>
	"Ready?!" cried Aryn to his soldiers as the trolls approached.  "Let's trim their numbers boys!  Loose!"
<br><br>
	The bow strings of the archers snapped taught and a flurry of arrows whistled through the air.  Three trolls fell from their mounts, their bodies torn by multiple punctures, before the rest veered their steeds away from the arrow paths.  Unyielding, the troll commander forced his host onward.
<br><br>
	"Ready your bows again!"  Aryn called and the archers knocked another group of arrows firmly into their strings.  "Aim!"  the trolls had recentered themselves and charged headlong once more for the bowmen.  "Loose!"
<br><br>
	One arrow struck a troll in the stomach, which sent the dying raider screaming to the ground.  Another arrow pierced a troll's neck and went straight through the flesh and out the back.  This raider was dead before he even was dismounted.  As these two trolls hit the sand, the rest of their comrades scattered their charge.
<br><br>
	Aryn watched as the trolls went in every direction.  "Guards!" he called.  "Attack at will!  Kill what you can when you can!"  Raising his blade into the air, Aryn reared his horse and prepared to charge.  "Elf!" he called to Edril.  "Time to find out what the master's paying you for, eh!?"  The barbarian's horse lunged forward and charged for the nearest enemy.  Edril raised his own blade and did the same.
<br><br>
	Down on the far end of the caravan, one troll had already begun his attack.  Tearing into the caravan guards with a ferocity second only to the ogres of Oggok, he severed the heads of two unsuspecting guards in a matter of seconds before charging boldly into three more.  The soldiers, unable to put up much of a fight, were slaughtered by the laughing raider as he cut down from his high and unreachable attack position.  He continued the assault all down the caravan until one guard lunged at the monster from the safety of a wagon, grabbed the creature, and brought him tumbling to the dirt.  Steel from all sides cut through the troll's body again and again until the bloodied raider fell silent and dead.
<br><br>
	Another troll crashed into the host of archers with a powerful scream and twirled his spear madly around him.  The archers, who futilely ran in every direction, tried desperately to protect themselves.  The spear's tip, a thin and deadly axe-blade with a spike pointing menacingly from the end, passed through bow and string and skin easily.
<br><br>
	Most of the archers were either cut apart or crushed by the powerful claws of the troll's mount before Edril reigned his horse around in response to their anguished screams and charged for the troll himself.  When the raider saw the elf coming from the corner of his eye, he only grinned and charged as well, dropping his spear and drawing the sword at his side.  The two met with a single sound: the clash of steel on steel.  But Edril moved with the poise of a seasoned warrior and the grace of a true born elf.  In a single movement the elf positioned his sword diagonally above him, deflected the troll's blade away, brought his sword around again, and cut in an upwards arc across the troll's chest.  The edge of Edril's curved blade found it's mark easily.  The raider rode past the elf and lowered his own sword as his mount slowly came to a stop.  There he sat in stunned silence just before his severed upper body slid from his legs and mount to the dirt below.
<br><br>
	While the caravan kept the closer trolls at bay, Aryn the barbarian shook the desert floor with his powerful cries of battle.  Two raiders were drawn straight to him, the first with his spear pointed for the barbarian's chest.  When the two warriors met, Aryn swung his thick blade madly before him, breaking the troll's spear into pieces, but reeled back and fell from his horse protecting his eyes from the dozens of splinters.  Running a gloved hand over his face to remind himself he wasn't dead, the northman picked himself up quickly from the sand and gripped his blade tightly with both arms.  His troll attacker, who had thrown his broken spear aside, drew his scimitar, turned his lizard steed around, and charged again.  When he was almost on top of Aryn, the troll swung his sword down and attempted to sever the barbarian's head from his shoulders.  Aryn, however, ducked beneath the blade and cut deep into the lizard's chest with his own sword, sending the creature reeling back and the troll spinning off into the dirt.  The raider slowly picked himself up on all fours, shook his head, and look around for his dropped scimitar.  His search, though, was to no avail as the barbarian buried his sword in the troll's back and spine with a savage cry.  
<br><br>
	The raider shivered once and dropped dead without even a chance to scream.  Just then the second raider started his charge against the barbarian, confident that the fallen soldier would be an easy kill.  With a strange calmness and a grim look, Aryn threw his sword to the ground, unhooked the bow at his back, drew an arrow from the strap at his side, and readied the weapons with both hands.  The troll raised his own spear while he called for the barbarian's blood and prepared himself for a throw.  Aryn released the arrow after a careful aim.  The thin shaft screamed through the air before striking the right eye of the troll's mount.  The creature fell, slamming into the dirt, and the troll was dismounted.
<br><br>
	Without hesitation, the raider gripped his scimitar and continued his charge against the barbarian with a horrific snarl before a guard's spear from somewhere near the wagons hit the troll in the back between the shoulder blades and sliced it's way through the troll's chest and out it's front.  The raider slumped to his knees and the spear's point sank into the dirt, keeping the dead body pivoted up and looking forward with a blank stare.
<br><br>
	The troll commander turned his head rapidly in every direction while he watched his soldiers die.  When Aryn killed his last guard, the head of the raiders tossed his helmet away, raised his own sword, and charged for the back of the unsuspecting barbarian.  Only Edril was close enough to see the quick movement.  "Aryn behind you!" he cried but the caravan leader was too far away.
<br><br>
	Lashing the reins on his horse, Edril drove his steed forward until he was close enough to the troll commander and then launched his sword forward through the air with a powerful stroke of his arm.  The blade flew and twirled with an abnormal grace before it struck the commander in the side with tremendous force.  The troll fell from his mount just before reaching Aryn.  Guards from everywhere and the remaining four archers all crowded the area and readied their weapons as the troll commander picked himself up.  On one side he nursed a bleeding arm while the other held his weapon.  The commander glared in every direction at the surrounding soldiers.
<br><br>
	"<em>Shagak buzah gartagi hag</em>!" Aryn commanded.
<br><br>
	The troll spoke in a garbled voice while he gnashed his fangs at the guards.  "<em>Zhol lark pag lorki</em>."
<br><br>
	"No…" Edril whispered to himself.
<br><br>
	"<em>SHAGAK BUZAH GARTAGI HAG</em>!" the barbarian ordered again.
<br><br>
	"<em>ZHOL LARK DUL ZISSTRIK DOL URAMPH NESHKIM</em>!" the troll screamed as he raised his sword.
<br><br>
	"No!" Edril yelled and held out his arm, but it was too late.  The troll commander ran forward to no one in particular with his blade above his head as the archers all released their bow strings.  The arrows slammed into the troll one after another and the commander was carried off his feet before falling to the ground.  His arm fell limp and his sword was dropped at his side.  From his chest bristled four different shafts, and his blood stained the white sands red.  
<br><br>
	Edril picked up his own blade with a tired hand and sheathed it at his side.  Brushing some hair away from his eyes, he looked to Aryn.  "What did he say?"
<br><br>
	The barbarian shook his head and stared at the dead chief.  "What…he uhhh…no it's impossible…"
<br><br>
	"What did he say!?"  Edril ordered in a stronger voice.
<br><br>
	Aryn looked straight at the elf.  "It's impossible!  He said '<em>zhol lark pag lorki</em>'.  'I die with honor.'  But it's impossible, damn him!  Trolls don't know honor and if they do it means nothing to them!"
<br><br>
	"What did he say after that?"
<br><br>
	"He said,"  the barbarian scratched his beard in confusion, "I die for…'<em>dol uramph neshkim</em>'.  That means 'death teller' or 'prophet.'  But then there's a word I don't know."
<br><br>
	"Which word?"
<br><br>
	"<em>Zisstrik</em>.  I can't translate.  He said 'I die for Zisstrik the prophet'."  Aryn looked around slowly and breathed heavily.  Guards everywhere wrapped bandages around bleeding cuts or broken limbs, while archers heaped the bodies of fallen comrades into a single pile.  "There's something more out here, Edril.  Something isn't right.  That commander should have surrendered."  The barbarian picked his own sword from the ground.  "But we can't handle it anymore.  We have to move north again, talk to John and see what he wants us to do."
<br><br>
	Edril nodded his agreement and the two men rode back to the wagons to survey what damage was done.  That night the funeral pyre of their fallen comrades reached to the stars and filled the desert with the eerie glow of death.

<br><br><br>
	In a small, fishing village no more then two miles from the kingdom of Grobb, a crowd was gathering.  The trolls in the small community were a horrid looking group of impoverished and hungry workers.  Their houses were mere caves cut in the hillside or makeshift piles of swamp drift-wood.  Each would be sitting down to a well deserved but ultimately unfulfilling meal at that hour, but they couldn't take their eyes off the spectacle before them.  Surrounded on every corner by a burly troll guard, a well robed speaker strut across a haphazard stage of fallen branches and swamp moss.  Normally the trolls of this village shunned all form of intelligent speech or entertainment, but that day something held their attention about the event, and each could not pull their eyes away from the speaker.  And so they listened, held entranced by unusual powers, to the one called Zisstrik the prophet.
<br><br>
	"Look at yourselves!" cried the troll.  "Look at what you have become!
	You are poor and needy, you live off the creatures in the swamp.  Lords
	in Grobb take all you harvest, and for what?  Do they prepare an army?
	No!  Do they use your goods to make the kingdom strong again?  No!  They
	use it for their own purposes, to open trading routes with the humans… <em>
	dol trehinimen</em>." Zisstrik spat the words.  "Do you know what you
	once were?  Do you know what your tribes did and what you can be again?
	You were all warriors!"  the troll raised a fist into the air.  "You
	were warriors who earned your pay on the field of battle!  Instead of
	feasting on the flesh of swamp creatures, you tasted the blood of fallen
	enemies!  We were powerful once!  <em>Gar uzkarn gurkel</em>!  We can be
	powerful again.  You!"  Zisstrik pointed at someone in the crowd with a
	thin finger.  "Do you know who Nalikor was?"  The spectator troll nodded
	slowly.  "Yes, everyone knows Nalikor.  <em>Dol brazust ragdushim</em>.
	He saved our people.  He brought our people to life from death and with
	what?  The net of a fisherman?  The hammer of a smith?  The horses of a
	farmer?  No!  He founded the trolls a new kingdom with his own sword,
	and his own blood.  He was a warrior!  And so are you!"  Zisstrik held
	his hand to the crowd.  "All of you.  You can be great again.  I have
	seen the vision of the ancient Trakanon…" suddenly the crowd began to
	hiss and murmurs swept through the village.  "No brothers!  The temples
	have lied to you to keep you under their control.  Trakanon never
	abandoned us.  He is our father!  Only he can lead us to victory!
	The texts you all have heard about explain how he alone once established
	the trolls as lords over an entire continent.  Trakanon has never left
	us, instead he sent Nalikor to take us here- to Antonica- a ripe land
	full of weaker races.  <em>Dol kaglimen al dol trehinimen</em>, the other
	races control a land where we should be masters!  Wouldn't you all like
	to sit as kings in the marble halls of Freeport?"  Zisstrik looked out
	across the crowd where several trolls nodded their heads.  "Wouldn't you
	like to taste the blood of the humans in Qeynos?  Or capture the lore of
	the dark elves in Neriak?!"  A silent yes was whispered from the gathered
	trolls.  "Isn't it your destiny, no, your innate responsibility, to march
	across the lands of Antonica and bring those weaker then yourselves to
	their knees?  To crush the humans and bury the elves!?"  The crowd
	resounded a louder yes.  "Would you give up your life with the swamp
	for a life by the sword!  Would you be rulers and kings once more!?"
	Yes! Cried the gathered trolls, whose eyes were filled with maddened
	dreams of conquest.  "Then join me, brothers!  Join the prophet!  I
	have heard the words of Trakanon and he guides us once more!
	<em>Burdok zholah ragdushimen al Antonica shak uzk garah</em>!!"
<br><br>
	"<em>Antonica shak uzk garah</em>!" the crowd echoed and the trolls howled and jumped madly in a crazed frenzy.  Zisstrik held out both arms, watched, and gave a wicked grin.


<br><br><br>
	Beneath the largest temple in the black city of Grobb, an old troll sat in a deep chamber where light flickered from a dozen torches and sunlight dare not touch.  All around him on crooked shelves were texts and scrolls dating back centuries, things no other troll had seen or was even permitted to see.  His thin body lost in the large folds of his cloak and weighed down by the heavy medalions around his neck, the ancient head priest of Cazic-thule tried desperately to stay awake as he studied the texts placed before him on a desk of dwarven stone.  The droning chants of his followers in the main hall just one floor above didn't help, and many times the old troll found himself begin to doze off.  He didn't have the strength for the amount of study required of him anymore, and this knowledge weighed on his soul even more then the oversized rings on his fingers weighed on his hands.
<br><br>
	Three knocks came from the outside of his door, and the old one picked his head up.  "<em>Bugh uzk gagash</em>?"  he asked the door with a wavering voice.
<br><br>
	The guard outside, a tall and muscular warrior covered in jagged chain mail armor, opened the door and bowed his respects.  Behind him was a much smaller troll clothed in red with his hands folded together.  "<em>Ug gorzin mukrazim</em>," the guard said in a fearful tone, "<em>gagash dul buz</em>."
<br><br>
	"<em>Gurzok ul, gurzok ul</em>," and the head priest waved the smaller troll inside.
<br><br>
	The small one moved past the guard who watched him carefully and growled.  "<em>Bulurh batum</em>," the troll said and bowed low before the old one.
<br><br>
	"<em>Bulurh Jalic, bumh tak buz shaduk</em>?" the old priest wrapped up his scrolls and placed them down on the floor beside his chair.
<br><br>
	"<em>Ler uzk barzog Zisstrik, batum</em>..."
<br><br>
	The old troll leaned back and seemed surprised from the news.  After a while in consideration, he placed one hand on his desk.  "Speak in common, Jalic."
<br><br>
	"<em>Dul bumh</em>?"
<br><br>
	"Just do what I say, Jalic, the walls have ears and so does my guard.  Close the door also."  The young troll closed the chamber door behind him.  "The last thing we need is more news of Zisstrik spreading through the kingdom.  Especially out of this temple."
<br><br>
	"I understand, head priest."
<br><br>
	"So what is the news, young one?"  the old troll cleared his throat and began to tap the table.
<br><br>
	"He grows stronger each day.  He gets new recruits in every village and at an increasing rate.  He's even formed a stationary base in the center of the desert.  More then fifty trolls he now has loyal to him and that number is growing…."
<br><br>
	"And what would you have me do, Jalic?  Force the temple to march against him?  Make his lies a reality?"  the head priest threw his arms into the air.  "The ogres would help us but laugh at us and Zisstrik may well become a martyr.  Civil war is what almost destroyed us, Jalic, I can't let that happen again.  It's bad business and bad for our reputation.  All we can do is keep his lies from spreading until we can find a solution.  But you knew this already!  And so did I!  Why do you waste my precious time for this recycled information?"
<br><br>
	"Because, sir," Jalic smiled humbly, "I may have found a solution."
<br><br>
	The head priest placed his hands on the table once more and leaned forward.  "Well now I am interested."
<br><br>
	"Zisstrik has suffered a defeat, sir.  A caravan packed with soldiers was able to wipe out his main raider line.  Scouts found their bodies only a few days ago.  Villages around Marr confirm it, the human John sent a caravan southward guarded by more men then usual and aided by a southern tracker, a barbarian named Aryn, and an elf named Edril."  The young troll took a few steps forward and lowered his voice.  "My thoughts sir, are what if in place of a temple army, we gather a few of these main soldiers, supply them with independent fighters from both Oggok and Grobb, and send them against Zisstrik?"
<br><br>
	"Again we resort to brute force?"
<br><br>
	"The force wouldn't draw attention to Grobb, and the problem would be solved."
<br><br>
	The head priest fell silent in thought for a few seconds, his fingers rapidly tapping the top of his desk.  "Edril…" he wondered allowed, "I thought he had vanished into retirement…Jalic!" he finally spoke and sat up in his chair, "your plan has some merit I'll give you that.  It just might work.  I want these men brought before me and I want you to handle it personally."
