<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got a bit of money and am now a lvl 4(soon to be 5) druid, any suggestions? 
<br><br>
Therien
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes!  Think spells first before you do much of anything else.  Once you have bought your spells, I'd suggest you find a good druid weapon (ask some high level druids that you see using /who all druid), start working on appropriate attire and acquire good backpack or two to save you trips to town while you're out hunting.  Save a few coins then for shelter from a cold night and a copper or two for the bard that sings you to sleep in the warm corner of the inn.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings!  I read your comments about wearing dresses and it made me wonder if there is any news on the possibilities of getting more choices on what female characters can wear.  It is fun to change clothes for RP events and such.  I wish to play a wood elf druid but they don't have anything but that Dominatrix outfit to wear as they are severely limited to armor types.  Am I mistaken or is there something out there she can put on that covers more?  Is there any hope for those of us that want to look more like adventurers and not "harem girls" (High Elves) or Dominatrices (Female woodelf druids)???  
<br><br>
Saphyre
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, clothing for everyone is fairly limited and we can only hope that some new items of fashion will be added for roleplay and fun.  Wood elves and high elves can, of course, wear items available for their classes, including armor and in some instances, robes.  Pity the poor half elf bard who either runs around with very little on or must wear field armor even for the dressiest occasions!  Like you, I'd love to see some variation in clothing made available for roleplay and I'd absolutely go wild if the half elf female bard is ever given a dress.  (Well so long as it is dark blue, dark green or maroon and is trimmed with some beautiful embroidery.  Just kidding!)
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was recently reading some new parchments from the EQVault press and under the Classifieds section I saw a question posed that was answered in many different ways.  I hope you can help clear this up!  The question was regarding the existence or non-existence of an experience bonus for me and my fellow humans vs. non-humans.  In my travels, I have never been able to confirm this bonus, but it does seem right that a class who lacks much in natural abilities (infravision, ultravision, slam, regenerate etc.) should make up for it through perserverence and a more balanced stat base.  Some responses to the classified said as much as 25 bonus, though I've heard myself only 10.  That seems fair to me, but does it even exist, or has my birth into the human race doomed me to a life of normalcy with no bonuses whatsoever?

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to a human Pillar of Wisdom to see if I could gain some understanding although I knew there was a chance my asking of your question would induce apoplexy since I had heard whispers of dissatisfaction of his lot as a human.  However, as luck would have it, I happened upon him on a beautiful day, the sun shining and the wine cooling in the well.  Tagad, being plied with a refreshing glass of his favorite wine, went so far as to admit that while there was indeed no "bonus" for humans, there was also the lack of penalty given to other races in all classes.  Thus according to clerical thinking, since there is this lack of penalty for humans, you could say that that was the bonus.  I'll leave you to determine if this makes sense but I do know that half elf bards bear a significant experience penalty and I have looked often with envy on those of other races and classes who move ahead far more easily than I do.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Garg wants to know where he can get a copy of "Archquest!" and I'm wondering if it comes with a free copy of "ArchyQuest".  Lanys says that we're both stupid for wanting these games, but I think she's just jealous because Lil' Archy has his own board game and she doesn't… Thanks!  
<br><br>

<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm I'm jealous too.  I want a Neppy boardgame where the winner gets a DRESS!  Actually I don't know where you might find a copy of "Archquest" or "ArchyQuest" but will put this extremely taxing question in the hands of my editors and see if they can help at all.  If you decide you want to help design a Nepenthia game, I'll make sure that anyone who wants one can get a copy.<br>
<em>Editor's note: We seem to be having trouble getting the merchants to sell the ArchQuest game.  They keep telling us something about ruining our own game group and we'll not ruin theirs.  And when the researchers try to design the Ask Nep game they are quickly driven mad by all of the questions!  And then some group called the Pillars of Wisewomen, or something, wants to maintain their copyrights...  it's a big mess.</em>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello to ya!  I have two questions to ask of you, 'n I figure you're the one to ask. ::smiles::  A dear friend of mine was visiting a tavern in Freeport after a long day in the desert... ((OOC:  There's no real way to keep this in character.  Sorry. :P  This friend of mine heard a sound layer of laughter and bustle in the tavern.  I hear music in the building, but I never hear any layer of patrons moving about.  Is there a setting I'm missing?)) I figured you would be the one t' ask, dear, seeing that you are a bard and most likely spend many hours entertaining crowds.  ::smiles::  Oh, I'd love to have you visit me in RiverVale so my Sister clerics and I could fashion you a lovely dress!  But I'm afraid we can't quite manage one in your size.  Best of luck to you, and thank you!

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is true that I love to find a comfortable seat and entertain all those who will listen, it seems that my expertise is more about lute tuning and flute polishing than about sound cards.  Is it possible your friend needs a soothing sea voyage for a month or two to see if these voices in his head might take their leave?  I've heard that such lulling vacations are much better than the rather primitive therapy taught to clerics these days.  OOC: I've never heard the laughter and bustling either but it is possible it's there and needs a spiffy sound card to hear it or perhaps you could hear it if you leave your sound on but turn off the music while in the inn.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When roleplaying, how do dwarves "speak"?  It seems the universal reference in EQ is Longjohn Silver, but somehow I don't think that's correct... 
<br><br>
Thromia
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arreeee me matie 'tis the pirates' life fer me" can be charming but in and of itself the lingo of Longjohn Silver is not really the source of dwarf speaking styles in Everquest.  Pillar of Wisdom Tagad is reasonably certain that he saw a posting that the barbarians and dwarves of Norrath are based on models from Scottish and Welsh cultures and that a stylized language fitting to that background would be appropriate.   In traditional fantasy settings, barbarians are often heard speaking with a Scots "burr" and dwarves are quite often heard speaking a blend of Scots with a bit of the lilt of Wales and the Yorkshire Hills of England.   You might want to take a look at the traditional poetry of Robert Burns  and other writers of Scotland or check into fantasy novels where dwarves use a dialect.  From what I remember, Tolkien did not use one for his dwarves, however, so it seems to me there is plenty of room for you to develop the distinctive dwarf voice that suits your character.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I read your Q&A about getting married on EQ... I'm a bit puzzled.  Is there anything really "official" in getting married if a cleric friend does the ceremony?  Isn't it then just roleplaying out the event, but yet, there's nothing gamewise that from then on says you are married or anything is there?  Unless you take the same last name, of which you said you would petition... But is that it?  Or is there something here I am missing?  If a Cleric friend does perform the ceremony is there anything they need to do to make it official?  Thanks for any answers to my questions, much appreciated! 
<br><br>
Alanah
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's my understanding that all weddings in Norrath, whether officiated by a GM or by a player character, are roleplay and do not cross over into an "official" status.  Last name changes are permitted as an enhancement to roleplay and again can be changed should the union fail and the parties resume single lives.  Since it is roleplay, I think the best way to make a wedding "official" is to have a ceremony that suits the race and classes of the players being married, have the names altered, and then make sure that the story of the wedding appears to interested parties.  I did check with a guide on this and he reminded me that while guides and GMs can and do officiate at weddings, they may not assist with items or transportation or even the safety of the wedding party, all of which must be arranged for ahead of time by the players.  They can, though, add a great deal of roleplay fun for the occasion as I mentioned before.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings, fine bard. I wish to peruse your vast amount of knowledge on a question that has been perturbing me recently. I am a Necromancer of the 7th amount of ability that has been having some trouble. You see, I am having a very difficult time gaining xp. Just tonight, I hunted for upwards of 3 hours (without a pet, mind you) and still only gained about a quarter bubble of xp. To give more detail, I have been killing white and blue cons, since I have been unable to properly destroy yellows and reds at my current level. Am I doing something horribly wrong? I have spoken to many wise, older Necromancer friends, and none can see why I am having such a hard time. According to them, I am killing the same filth that they did at my level. I currently have 18 hours play time to get to 7th level. My last incarnation (a troll shaman) had made 7th in 6.5 hours. Is there anything to help me? I have finally found a profession I love, but it is very frustrating to be unable to advance. Can you advise me? 
<br><br>
Jhenik

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't mention if you are using a pet while you adventure.  Some young necromancers miss out on this, but you are able to gain at pet at level 4, and an even better one at level 8.  The pet will only take about 1% of the experienced gained you will be able to level faster.  Assuming that you have been using a pet, then the next thing you might want to consider is find someone to tank for you.  Killing will go much faster with another person until you are high enough level to get a really good pet.  Several other factors go into the speed at which you level.   You need to take your race into consideration for sure.  If you are a dark elf or an Erudite, you will level more slowly than a human, for instance.  There is another reality out there as well.  All creatures that con /blue or whatever to you will not necessarily give you the same amount of experience, I believe.  Finally, it's important to realize that certain classes and races just do level faster.  Melee classes for instance almost always race ahead as they have little to worry about besides hitpoints.  It seems like if you want to speed up leveling, you would probably then want to use your   pet as much as possible, group with a good tank, find a decent weapon that helps you kill faster, compare experience from npcs that con the same and don't waste time on the ones that don't give decent experience, and be realistic about the experience penalties that some races and classes have.  Hope this helps!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A bit of advice for the gent who made the mistake of raising the ire of the Surefall druids. Although the deaths of gnolls of Blackburrow will definitely assist him in regaining standing with the druids of Surefall, the deaths of the Unkempt Preservers in Rathe mountains will impress the dour druids even further. Not to mention he may find this a much more enriching experience than a rendezvous with the hounds of Blackburrow. One warning, however. They do call them the Unkempt Preservers for a reason, and you may find the stench of Blackburrow far preferable to the unwashed druids.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing in with the advice, I hope he finds this beneficial.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering how one could find out if a magical item with charges is rechargable and how to do so. I have heard many speak of being able to do this but no one I have seen has explained how it can be done. Thanks. 
<br><br>
Tauithar Tausiirath
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The only item I know for sure that is rechargeable is the squad ring which has a questlike process for recharging.  There may be others in the game but I haven't heard of them yet.  Most items that have charges are simply used up over time and must be replaced.  If you think the magical item  you have might possibly be rechargeable, you should ask around to others who may be using the same item to see if they have found any way to replenish it.  Also, you might want to spend some time doing npc questing, asking about the item and seeing if you get any response to your queries.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes it is me again.  This is a comment to the player regarding /played time.  I went through some old screen shots the other day and noticed I had 16+ days on Ardel at level 20, and 73 days (that is 43 work weeks..........) when I made level 50.  Now a lot of that time was spent fishing in Rivervale, and other places.  Love the sunset seen from Sisters Island.  It is not all about levels and equipment, it really is all about finding a dress for bards.  On faction in Blackburrow.  Go help lower level players there.  Remember that a heal or a small DD or rain spell will give you faction adjustment, no need to get the kill.  Also good way to make friends.  I had the same problem, and a good day of helping with crowd control in BB made my faction ok again.  Now if only the citizens of Kaladim where as easy to appease.

ps.  We are long overdue for that drink Nepenthia.
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah my old friend, it is long since we met in the wilds of Karana and  you assisted me and Adelrune in our search for adventure.  I'm glad to hear from you and appreciate the wisdom you have to offer.  Congratulations on your exalted level but even more, congratulations on having such a delightful attitude about living a full life in Norrath.  I thank you for writing and if the ornery small people of Kaladim don't succumb to your charms soon, I'll be extremely surprised.   I should be returning to the sea for a brief respite in the near future.  Perhaps we can sit and watch the light play over the water and share that drink we keep promising ourselves.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Through my gullibility as one that likes to help people I was suckered into helping kill a troll in a Neriak 3rd Gate bar.....I lost a mound of faction with the Dark Bargainers.  I was informed that there is a Necro in the library that you give 4 bottles of red wine to regain faction but my faction is too low to do this because of the previous loss of faction and because of the deity I believe in (which is The Fire Bringer Solusek Ro).Thus my question is this...what other options are open to me to regain faction with the said Dark Bargainers? 
<br><br>
Nyzar D'vizzrack
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;While I had Tagad sitting comfortably with that glass of wine, I asked him your question as well since my experience with the darker side of Norrath is quite limited.  The cleric said that although he has no clue how to raise faction with the Dark Bargainers, he does know how to lose it.  He also said that if you ever found the Oracle of Mardrig, that perhaps you could kill him and raise your faction.  However, even though finding the oracle in OOT would lower your faction some more if you killed it,  you might be able to gain it back if that other oracle does exist.  Tagad says he has never heard of any finding it though.  The other possible approach is to consider who the Dark Bargainers are.  If they are high elves working with dark elves (shame on them!) you might be able to  piece together enough information to find out which npcs might help raise your faction.  If all else fails, perhaps someone can write in and suggest other ways to accomplish your goal.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiya silly elf! I has a question fer ye, while logging to EQ, there is an button called "option" and if ye click on it, it will tell ya that it's a primary display whatever.   I was wondering does EQ support 2 monitors?  If yes, is it worth it? 
<br><br>
Vajzar
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I understand it, the option button at the beginning of the login process to Everquest is simply to select the video card you'll be using to play Everquest.  As far as I know, there is no support for two monitors to play the game.  You could try writing to eqvideo@verant.com and asking about the possibility of using two monitors if you are truly interested or visit the Everquest technical FAQ at www.everquest.com.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering why, when I click on "Send us your topic" on EQ Express - Sending a question, does it always tell me that file not found, but you seem to get the questions I send in..... 
<br><br>
Vajzar
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what the editor and web person says about your question:  "<em>This is a problem with the script that sends out the 'Thanks for sending your topic' page.  I haven't been able to nail down what causes it.  But it's only a problem with the thank you page, the information has always made it into the file, and therefore always makes it to me.  Over the last year I've learned to just shrug when this happens, and hope that one day it clears itself up.  :}</em>"  Your questions do come through just fine and I hope you'll write again.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What three words in the English language end in    G--R--Y???
<br><br>
Anonymous
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm well I got hungry and angry all at the same time but it took the help of an anonymous Pillar of Wisdom to get beyond the angst and appetite to the word "aggry", which I think is a real word.  Apparently "gry" itself is a word  unless the masked Pillar of Wisdom was joking around with me, so would you say there are four?

<br><br><br><br>

Thanks all for writing in.  I love hearing from you and hope you enjoy the answers.
