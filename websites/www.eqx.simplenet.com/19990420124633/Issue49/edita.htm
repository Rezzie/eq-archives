Well, the group dynamic is changing.  When we started out we were a group of individuals.  Not that most of us couldn't or wouldn't work together.  We just didn't know each other all that well.  But my character, Ryan, was forced to admit that he had a problem.  Due to events in his recent past, the walking dead terrify him.  And our even more recent encounter with a vampire (a mere planer vampire) made that clear to everyone.  While they were fighting for their lives with the vampire, Ryan was huddled in a closet, crying and shaking.  A man once able to destroy tanks was left a shallow wreck.  It was difficult for him to be so vulnerable.  And it was even harder for him to ask for help.  But he did.
<br><br>
Our employer gives us a good salary.  He also gives us a weekly bonus.  The bonus is equal to one weeks pay, and is given to the one that he deems the most worthy.  As soon as we heard this, the group decided that such a payment was an inducement for competition amongst us, and we didn't want that.  So we decided that we would split that reward evenly, no matter who won it.  Our pixie, Wyland, had decided that he would remain separate from that bargain.  He told us that he would likely get more bonuses, and that it would not benefit him to split those bonuses with us.  And he was right.  He's easily won more than the rest of us.  But after our last mission (one that took us out into the Outlands to deliver a book for a cat - long story...), he decided to join in.  He said that he felt like too much of an outsider.  It felt like a real breakthrough.
<br><br>
So Ryan asked the reclusive pixie to help him overcome his fears.  Wyland is able to make illusions.  So Ryan asked him to confront him with the walking dead.  He hopes to overcome his fear a bit by becoming used to it.  We both kind of doubt that it will work.
<br><br>
What I find interesting about our current campaign is that the characters are advancing in power much faster than they are in maturity.  In our usual games characters advance pretty slowly.  It's like the proverbial "Three steps forward, two steps back."  We are normally pounded into pulp and reformed ten times before we reach third level.  By fourth all the characters feel like the most seasoned of adventurers.  And they are.  In most campaigns we get a reasonable amount of experience points, and we level at a fair pace.  I'm not saying that we don't.  But in this newest one the experience, money and magic is just pouring in.  And the optional rules that have been added make us very powerful at a low level.  Ryan is fourth level after only a few games, and he is easily as powerful as our average sixth level character in other games.  When he makes fifth level he'll rank with a mage at twice his level.
<br><br>
This means that our power is outstripping our maturity.  We have only just now started to work like a group.  We have only just begun to learn anything about each other.  And our knowledge of our surroundings is very limited.  This is less of a problem for a group of gamers that has been together for years.  We know each other.  And no matter how good of a roleplayer you think you are, you are still going to be predictable to a group like that.  But it still makes for an interesting dynamic.
<br><br>
And while I am enjoying the light speed advancement of this campaign, I still prefer to earn my characters.  I still like to feel that reaching a level is an accomplishment.  I still prefer it the old way.  And I am one that is glad to here that EverQuest will require a long time for advancement.  If in two years Absor is still trying to get into some of the more interesting places in Norrath, I'll be glad.  Knowing me, in two years I still won't have any characters of any reasonable level.  I like to fiddle around with a lot of characters.  For me, EQ may be a 3 year game...  And that's great!
