"Perfect, just perfect," Jarak thought to himself as he pulled out a lockpick from his belt. He had been waiting outside the bank of Felwithe for two hours now. The guard had finally given himself a break, figuring that no thief could be THAT nocturnal. A rare smile came across his lips. A Dark Elf was at home in the darkness, and were therefore the best rogues. True, he had heard rumors that some Halfling rogues should be amazingly fast with their fingers, they lacked the night-time mind that a Tier' Dal was born with. 
<br><br>
He had left Neriak two days ago, hearing rumors that a wealthy dwarven merchant had just recently made a rather large deposit in the Felwithe bank. After having traveled many long, hard hours, through thick forest, and over rocky, hilly terrain, and countless encounters with many a monster, along with a trip over the ocean, he had reached Felwithe.
<br><br>
Now, finally, he was here, in the cold rain, and he was having trouble with the lock. Not a hard lock, really, but it was an enchanted lock. He only had one magic lockpick, and he hadn't quite gotten used to the feel of it yet. After poking around in the lock for a while, he heard a satisfying "click". Pleased, he praised Innoruuk and Bristlebane for his good luck. He stepped inside the bank. 
<br><br>
The great marble halls were too bright, he thought, but then again, High Elves always had a strange obsession with light. It took a while for his ultravision to adjust itself to the bright marble, but after a couple of minutes, and some stumbling around in the big open space, he could clearly see the bank's interior. He then spotted his prize, the big vault in the end of the bank.  Looking over the lock, it looked fairly simple to operate. Two small key-shaped holes, and a handle. He knew these kinds of locks. He pulled two lockpicks from his belt, and inserted them into the two holes simultaneously. After poking in the holes for a while, the picks found the proper setting, and he turned them both at the same time.
<br><br>
"Click". He loved that sound. He turned the handle, and pulled. The vault opened to one of the most beautiful sights he had ever seen. Gold and gems gleamed back at him. Looking over the treasure, messy as it was, his heart skipped a beat. Separated from the other piles, he saw the biggest pile of platinum he had ever seen. He estimated roughly 5000 platinum pieces, and those were just the ones he could see. Stuffing his backpack with platinum, he thanked Innoruuk once again for platinum being so light to carry. He then set his sights on a pedestal. There was a sheet covering something big. He pulled off the sheet, and....his eyes opened wide with awe, and he smiled with greed. Licking his lips, he grabbed the enormous green gem off the pedestal. 
<br><br>
Looking at the pedestal, he noticed that the little button that the gem rested on was moving upwards, and he heard a "click". But, knowing clicks, this wasn't a good click. 
<br><br>
Then all hell broke loose. An alarm went off, and he could hear the guard opening the door from outside. He bolted out of the vault, and ran towards the door. Just as he was about to open the door, he figured that there was probably more than five guards outside armed with plate mail and broadswords, or even worse, axes. He stood next to the door, and pressed his back against the wall. The door slammed open, and smashed against his chest. Fortunately, he was wearing think leather armor, and the hit wasn't so bad. He watched the guards storm inside, look around, and then storming into the vault. Just as the last guard entered the main door, Jarak unsheathed his poisoned dagger, and stabbed the guard in the back. The guard let out a small cry, and sank to the floor. Jarak bolted out of the bank, and headed for the main gate. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, all of Felwithe was either awake and storming to the bank to check if their stuff had been stolen, or screaming at the guards to turn the damn alarm off. Jarak, being the only Dark Elf, knew it wouldn't be long before the guards would start noticing him, especially with a backpack bulging with platinum. Just as he was at the gates, he saw the guards had already set up a barricade, and were questioning all people who entered or left. "Damn", he whispered to himself. He pulled his hood over his head, and tried to sneak past the guards. 
<br><br>
"You there!" one of the guards yelled at him.
<br><br>
"Yes, m'lord?" he replied, trying to make himself sound as Human as possible.
<br><br>
"Have you seen any suspicious people sneaking around the bank in the last hour?" the guard said harshly.
<br><br>
"Yes, a filthy Dark Elf. I believe he went that way.", he said, pointing in the direction he had just come from.
<br><br>
"Ok, now get lost, you stinkin' human!" the guard said to his face. Turning to his men, he yelled "Go check the southern part of town boys, he couldn't have gotten far!"
<br><br>
The other guards started running towards the bank. The guard turned to Jakar. 
<br><br>
"You still here?!?" he said rudely. "I told you to get lost, you human bag of filth!"
<br><br>
Jakar pulled his hood back partially, revealing his face.  "Don't ever call me a human," he said coldly, and stabbed the guard in the stomach before he could do anything. The guard let out a yelp, then slumped to the ground.
<br><br>
Jakar walked coolly out of the gates.

<u>The Curse of the Gem</u>
<br><br>

The fire crackled as Jarak finished putting up his hammock. He had found a suitable spot to rest, and two conveniently located trees. Overhead, he could hear an owl hooting. The bugs were also happily clicking away. Jarak smiled once again. He had been smiling a lot tonight, not only because of his loot, but also because it had been so easy breaking into the bank, and getting past the guards. Never had he figured High Elves to be so stupid. Oh well, the Light had probably blinded their good sense. After eating a good Orc steak, he went to sleep.
<br><br>
A couple hours later, he was awakened abruptly by the sound of something rustling in the brush near him. He opened his eyes a little. The jungle around him was bathed in Ultravision, and he could clearly see a human hiding in the brush beyond the small clearing he had made for the fire. He moved a little, making some sleeping noises, so his hand was resting on the hilt of his dagger. The human stopped, then let out a deep sigh. Jarak cursed himself for leaving his backpack next to the fire and not keeping it with him when he slept. The human silently snuck over to the backpack, and opened it. He let out a small cry as he saw what the backpack held. Jarak unsheathed his knife and quietly slipped out of his hammock. Using his elbows to move forward, he stood two feet away from the human, who was now greedily stuffing his pockets with platinum coins. Just as Jarak took a step forward to introduce the human to his foot of steel, he stepped on a twig. The human spun to face Jarak, who was holding his dagger high in the air, ready to stab. Nothing happened. Jarak looked at the human, surprised he had been caught, and the human was wondering if he could turn and run faster than Jarak could stab. Realizing someone was gonna take the offensive, Jarak decided to move, swiping at the human. It was a weak hit, and only scratched the human, but scared him enough to start running. Jarak gave chase. The human was bolting through the forest as fast as he could, screaming "inkie! Rogar!" for no apparent reason. Jarak was trying to close his backpack while running, not wanting someone to snatch it while he chased the human. 
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the human disappeared into a bush and vanished. Jarak, knew that the bush was just a small wall into a clearing surrounded by rock. Unless the human was good at climbing, he was trapped. Confident, Jarak stepped into the clearing only to feel a knot tighten in his stomach. In front of him stood three towering Barbarian warriors, and an Erudite. Two of the Barbarians were equipped with long swords, almost five feet each. The biggest one held an enormous two-handed axe, the largest Jarak had ever seen. The Erudite's robe gave out a slight glow, and so Jarak assumed he was a mage. The human was cowering behind all of them, trying not to be noticed.
<br><br>
"Well, well, well" the big one said, "what do we have here?"
<br><br>
"I think we got us a stray inkie, Rogar", the Erudite replied. 
<br><br>
"Look, I just want my money back." Jarak tried. "Your friend stole about 150 platinum pieces, which I've worked very hard for."
<br><br>
"Really?", the tall one, who the others had called Rogar, said. 
<br><br>
"Yes."
<br><br>
"Well then, let me see your backpack."
<br><br>
"My backpack?"
<br><br>
"Yes, your backpack. Take it off."
<br><br>
"And why should I do that?"
<br><br>
"What do you keep in it?" Rogar asked harshly.
<br><br>
"Just my belongings." Jarak said innocently.
<br><br>
"My friend Loke tells me that there was more than 2000 platinum in that backpack, and a rather large green gem."
<br><br>
"He's lying."
<br><br>
"You know, I'd like to believe that, but it's just that we passed by Felwithe an hour ago, and there was a bank robbery earlier this evening. The amount stolen matches that in your backpack."
<br><br>
"I could be a very good fisherman."
<br><br>
"Hardly. The only time I saw that much booty, was when I served in the Halas guard corps."
<br><br>
"Well, if you must know, I found it."
<br><br>
The barbarian laughed loudly and rudely, until he turned red.
<br><br>
"I fail to see what's so humorous."
<br><br>
"You know boy," the Erudite broke in, "there is a large bounty on your head. 200 platinum to those who bring back your corpse and the gem. 400 to those who bring you back alive."
<br><br>
"Look, let me go, and I'll give you part of the platinum. That's more than you would have gotten if you took me back with you."
<br><br>
"Sorry, the dwarf promised us employment as his guards if we brought you back alive."
<br><br>
The Barbarian broke in.
<br><br>
"Let me see that gem."
<br><br>
"No."
<br><br>
The other two barbarians smiled and lifted their swords. Jarak opened his backpack and took out the gem.  It glowed stronger in the moonlight. 
<br><br>
"Oh my god..." one of the barbarians sighed.  "It must be worth at least a thousand plat, Rogar."
<br><br>
"Well, this is where we stop chatting my friend," Rogar said. "Get him boys."
<br><br>
They smiled grimly and and lifted their swords, ready to chop. Jarak quickly scanned his surroundings for a way out. He saw none. Just as he was sure to die, the gem started emitting a strange noise. The Barbarians looked dumbfounded for a second, then the gem started screaming, and a shower of magical energy flew from within it at the Barbarians, burning their flesh and melting their weapons. A disgusting stench arose from their bodies. Then, the screaming stopped, and the most magnificent thing Jarak had ever seen formed. A green mist seeped from the gem, moving towards the humans. The barbarians were still trying to recover from the blast of energy, and looked in horror as the mist crept toward them. The mist rose in the air, and spread out, finally concealing the whole band of humans. Then, it closed in on itself, and where the humans had been in the mist, they were no more. Jarak looked at the gem and threw it at the ground, horrified at its power. The gem started singing gently, calming Jarak. He picked it up and shoved it in his backpack. More people would be coming this way soon, and daytime was not a good time for a Dark Elf to be out, especially near Felwithe. He decided to head for Neriak as fast as he could. Raltar had to know something.
