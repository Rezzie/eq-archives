Hi,
<br><br>
I am Razor's MOM. I have learned more about my offspring from 
reading his articles in your publication than I ever learned when I was 
raising him.; Isn't he amazing.. so imaginative.. funny.. creative. 
He gets it honestly. Just kidding. He was always an imaginative child, 
drawing dungeons and dragons figures for as long as I can remember. He 
had a fascination for the inner workings of everything electronic 
(nothing was safe!) He built my first computer from "junk" he had laying 
around. It's now my husband's because I have a newer, faster Pentium 
that Razor built for me. Now if he would just reconfigure my sound card 
so Myst would not create a GPF, I would be happy. (Until I install 
something else.) That's the nice thing about having a GEEK for a son, however,  I
prefer to call him a GURU. If I feed him he works for free!!
<br><br>
Did I say I'm very proud of my son?
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
<em>Razor's MOM</em>
<br><br><br><br>
Thanks Mom!!   *blush*
<br><br> 
I never dreamed my biggest fan in life would be my own mother :)  She is
the greatest. Oh and very much a geek in training!  Keep up the good work
my child *grin*. 
<br><br>
<em>Razor</em></p>
