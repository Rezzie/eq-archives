Kendrick squatted on the damp ground, the fog creeping around his ankles, and frowned at the setting sun.  "Why does this have to be at night?"
<br><br>
Jalen frowned, his bushy eyebrows meeting in confusion.  "Because they are undead?"
<br><br>
Kendrick turned and glared at the hulking barbarian, who in turn smiled innocently and returned his gaze to the hills.  The Hills of Qeynos had always seemed peaceful and welcoming.  Not today.  Within them, somewhere, lurked an unspeakable evil.
<br><br>
Jalen turned and regarded the mismatched group behind him.  Hundreds of people from all walks of life, here to defend their city from the will of Vashaar.  Walking through the crowd, his robes blood red in the last light of the sun, Ozymandius approached him.
<br><br>
"Any sign?" asked the Erudite wizard.
<br><br>
Kendrick shook his head.  "Nope.  But you know they'll wait until full dark.  That gives them the greatest advantage."  Kendrick grunted and stood, his hands settling restlessly upon the hilts of his weapons.  "I hate waiting," he said to no one in particular, turned, and walked back into the crowd.
<br><br>
Two striking figures nodded politely to him as they approached the group.  Both well over 19 hands tall, they stopped short of Ozymandius and waited respectfully until he noticed them.  The wizard turned and smiled.  "Baldaan!  Wynd!  I'm glad you could make it."  He stepped forward, arm extended in greeting to both of them.
<br><br>
Baldaan, splendorous in his mail, accepted the proffered arm firmly.  "The Paladins of Marr stand ready to destroy the spawn of Varsoon.  May he soon go to join those he summons from the ground."  The paladin's voice booming in the quiet twilight, his eyes bright with unsuppressed excitement at the upcoming mayhem.
<br><br>
Wynd also took Ozyamdius' arm and shook it.  "Halas sends her best, my friend."
<br><br>
Ozymandius nodded.  "With you and yours here, we are sure to win the day."
<br><br>
The two turned and walked back to their respective groups.  The wizard also turned, stepping back to stand beside Jalen, watching the encroaching darkness.
<br><br>
"You did not sound like you believed that," observed Jalen quietly.
<br><br>
"I did not.  This will not be an easy fight, and I fear the worst.  Varsoon is an ancient adversary, and rarely commits himself to open conflict.  He will throw everything he can at us."  Ozymandius frowned, peering into the darkness.
<br><br>
"Whatever he can dig up, eh?"  Jalen regarded the wizard with a perfectly straight face.
<br><br>
Ozymandius regarded his tall friend seriously for a moment, then chuckled.  Shaking his head, he resumed his inspection of the horizon.  After a moment, he felt a vibration through the ground.  A dull thud, followed by another.  Kneeling down, he placed his hand upon the ground and felt it there.  A series of impacts with the ground.  Almost like… footsteps.
<br><br>
"There!" Jalen pointed into the darkness as he shouted the alarm.  The fog parted to reveal an army of skeletons shambling their way towards the city walls.  And, in the lead, Warbones… the undead skeletons of Hill Giants.  Jalen drew his weapons and ran forward to meet the enemy, shouting "Onward!"
<br><br>
The mass of people behind him surged forward, a cacophony of battle cries ringing into the night.  Unafraid, though the creatures from their nightmares descended upon them, they threw themselves into the battle.
<br><br>
Jalen met the first Warbone head on, his massive hammer sending splinters of bone flying in all directions.  Huge bony fists rained down from far above, smashing into the ground near the barbarian as he dodged and smashed the monster.  Other undead came to its rescue, dread skeletons clawing, biting, and slashing at Jalen, trying to pull him from their leader.  Ozymandius began to draw upon his inner strength, painting runes in the air with his fingers as his spell energy built.  Then, with an arcane cry, lightning sprung forth from his fingertips, striking a dread skeleton and obliterating it instantly.  The Warbone, drawn to the pull of magic, stepped over the barbarian and advanced on the wizard to quickly dispatch him.  Ozymandius repeated the motions to pull the lightning from the sky again as the giant skeleton closed on him, Jalen at it's heels bashing at it with all his might.
<br><br>
The Warbone raised its foot to smash the wizard as the lightning sprang forth again.  It struck the skeleton in the midst of the rain of blows from Jalen, and it toppled and fell, crushing several other undead in it's wake.  Jalen smiled a lopsided grin at Ozymandius, who sighed deeply… "Too close for comfort, eh?"
<br><br>
The wizard nodded mutely and gestured for the barbarian to advance.  Glancing about, bodies were strewn everywhere…undead and simply dead.  Unused to fighting en masse, the group lacked the coordination so desperately needed to fight an army that fought with one mind…that of its creator…Varsoon.  Ozymandius began throwing fire about as quickly as he could, harming and destroying skeletons as they advanced, the people beginning to scatter before them in panic.
<br><br>
"Rally at the marker!" a shout rang out.  Atop the huge stone marker in the road stood Helz, a human wizard that called Qeynos his home.  Hearing the cry, people began falling back to the intersection, drawing strength from their numbers, and staving off the push.  Ozymandius was turning to follow when he was hit by a crushing blow that sent him slamming into the ground several feet away.  Dazed and stunned, he pushed himself to his feet to see a Warbone descending upon him.  Shaking his head to clear it, he tried to cast a spell, only to be caught in the vice like grip of the giant skeleton's hand and squeezed.
<br><br>
With one arm pinned, he was unable to cast.  The breath squeezed out of him, he was unable to shout.  Just as the world begin to go black, he heard the cries from below.  The group from the marker had seen him and closed on the monster, desperately trying to break the wizard free.  Working as a group for the first time, they made short work of the giant skeleton and soon Ozymandius was on the ground, attempting to disentangle himself from the giant bony hand, trying to force air back into his lungs.
<br><br>
Jalen scooped an arm beneath the wizard and unceremoniously tossed him over his shoulder and hurried back to the marker.  Once there, the barbarian dumped Ozymandius on the ground like a sack of wheat and returned to the front lines, leaving him to gasp for air and try to move his ribs back into place.
<br><br>
Deeper in the hills, Kendrick moved quickly.  Low to the ground, sliding from bush to bush, tree to tree, using all existing cover to move undetected towards his destination… the ruins.  As he crested the hill, sliding into a gully to avoid the skeletons that ran past, he peeked over and surveyed the situation.
<br><br>
Atop the hill stood the ruins of an ancient church, a church that had fallen to evil when it's priest deceived its flock and murdered them all, sacrificing them in an unholy ritual.  In return for the sacrifice, untold power was bestowed upon the priest…Varsoon. During the ritual, the church was blasted apart, and all that remained these many years later were stones, sticking out of the hilltop like rotted teeth.
<br><br>
Varsoon stood there, his face expressionless, as he conversed with the other figure there…Daedeloth, the necromancer.  They both spoke quietly, and Kendrick was too far to hear, but they both seemed pleased.  Periodically, a skeleton would rise from the ground as black tendrils of magic coalesced around it.  Varsoon would examine it critically, then send it on its way.
<br><br>
Kendrick tried to see a path to the ruins that would bring him close enough to take Varsoon out without being detected, but none presented itself.  Cursing quietly to himself, he shifted down and around the hill to get a better view.
<br><br>
The group from the marker had cleared out most of the undead in that area and had begun making it's way up the road towards the ruins.  As opposition appeared, the army would surge forward and destroy it savagely, avenging those that had fallen that day.  Ozymandius walked slowly with the group, leaning heavily on his staff and his arm holding his side carefully.
<br><br>
As the army approached, Varsoon became agitated.  Kendrick watched him as he gazed off into the distance, watching with some inner eye, then pulled more undead from the ground to send to crush his opposition.  Daedeloth stepped back a bit, shifting into the shadows of the broken stones, and watched warily.  Kendrick slid down the hill a bit and turned towards the road.  In the distance, he could make out the torches of the advancing army.  Quickly he made his way down the rest of the hill, then sprinted across the flat ground the rest of the distance to the group.
<br><br>
Skidding to a halt in front of the point group, he nodded to Jalen and Baldaan.  "Varsoon's just over the hill, and he looks pissed,"  Kendrick chuckled quietly.
<br><br>
"Then let us go alleviate his discomfort," growled Baldaan.  He turned to the group behind him and shouted, "The end is near, the enemy before us.  Let us drive them forth and rid ourselves of this vermin.  Onward!"
<br><br>
A large portion of the army began a run towards the hill, with a smaller group staying behind at the road to guard the injured.  Ozymandius found a tree to lean against and rested, silently wishing the group well.
<br><br>
As they approached the hillside, a pale-skinned humanoid appeared atop it.  The army started the ascent when Varsoon shouted and the side of the hill sprouted a dozen dread skeletons, who charged down the hill to fend off the invaders.  During the ensuing melee, Varsoon cast spells into the group, draining the life from defenders, or inflicting rotting plagues upon them.  Laughing maniacally, the necromancer was so involved in the defense, he failed to note two things.  
<br><br>
The first was Daedeloth's quiet departure.  Seeing defeat imminent and having no need to stay and die, the Teir'dal necromancer cast his spell and vanished, unnoticed by anyone.
<br><br>
The second occurrence to escape Varsoon's notice was the small group of barbarians that stealthily crept around the hill.  He realized his mistake too late, as the barbarians rushed up the hill and took him from behind.
<br><br>
His current spell disrupted, he turned to face his assaulters, his very touch draining the life from them.  But they would not be denied, their savagery like that of the beasts they hunted, and they wailed upon the necromancer with weapons of metal and wood.  As Varsoon's attention was distracted, the army of skeletons was dispatched and the remainder of the force moved up the hill.
<br><br>
Finally, foreseeing the inevitable, he attempted to cast a spell to remove himself from the fray.  As his hands moved quickly through the arcane movements, the sword of a young barbarian, named Lorgurce, snaked through his defenses and cleanly removed his head, sending it tumbling through the sky to land a few feet away.  The hands stopped their motions as the body toppled backwards onto the wet grass.
<br><br>
"We must burn it, immediately," shouted Baldaan, and the army quickly spread out to gather wood.  Soon a large pyre was built and Varsoon's headless body lay upon it.  However, try as they might, the group could not get the sodden wood to hold a spark.
<br><br>
"Allow me," said a tired voice from behind them.  As one, they turned around to see Ozymandius slowly plodding up the hillside.  He stopped a few feet away, casually flicked his fingers, and the pyre burst into scarlet flames.  
<br><br>
Lorgurce stepped up to Ozymandius and bowed.  Then he lifted his arm to show he held the head of Varsoon in his hands, by the hair.  "It is done," he said, and dropped it to the ground.
<br><br>
"Varsoon can never be truly killed, my young friend.  This was just his corporeal form.  His spirit is too evil and powerful to be killed by conventional means.  But we have hurt him, badly.  He will certainly think twice about stepping from his grave again."  Ozymandius picked up the head with distaste and tossed it into the fire.  The fire hissed and popped, burning a deep scarlet at its core.
<br><br>

Many miles away, in the depths of Neriak, Vashaar stood in his sanctum and watched.  The brazier of blood before him showed him the scene in the Qeynos Hills as if he were there himself.  Beside the wizard stood the necromancer Aezar, also gazing into the brazier.
<br><br>
"It appears we have lost the day, Favoured One."  Aezar smiled slightly, regarding his 'Master' evenly.  "Varsoon is defeated and Daedeloth returns even as we speak."
<br><br>
"Yes, but at what cost?"  Vashaar stepped back from the scrying pool and picked up his glass of wine.  Sipping from it delicately, he glanced at the brazier once more, then turned his gaze upon the necromancer.  "Many died, they are weakened over all, and Ozyamandius is wounded.  He is old and can not keep up the pace.  We will wear him down and keep him moving.  Soon he will falter and then we shall strike."
<br><br>
A guard stepped in and cleared his throat softly.  Vashaar turned and regarded him coldly, nodding to give him permission to speak.  "The guest you summoned has arrived, Master."
<br><br>
"Good."  Vashaar set down his glass and stepped over to his meeting room, Aezar following silently.
<br><br>
The Teir'dal parted the curtain and entered the room.  Immediately, the room's sole occupant, a flashily dressed half-elven bard, slid to his feet, doffed his hat, and bowed deeply.  "How can this humble scribe serve you, Oh, Favoured of Innoruuk?"  
<br><br>
Vashaar waved his hand, annoyed, and Gellor straightened, smiling slightly.  "What news do you have?"
<br><br>
"As you thought, Ozymandius brought the book to me to translate.  Given I'm the only bard in all of Antonica that speaks Elder Teir'dal, it was the only logical assumption.  I've come to ask what it is you wish me to tell him it means."  Gellor nodded politely to Aezar, who returned his nod noncommittally.  
<br><br>
Vashaar nodded.  "A moment."  He stepped back through the curtain and strode across the room.
<br><br>
As Vashaar exited, Aezar stepped towards Gellor and quickly handed him a rolled parchment and a small sack of coins.  Gellor deftly accepted them, hid them on his person, and resumed his position as Aezar stepped back to his prior location.  The curtains parted again and Vashaar returned, carrying a stack of parchments in his hand.
<br><br>
"Give them this as the false translation," he said, handing the stack to Gellor.  "That should keep him busy while I make ready to seize my betrothed."
<br><br>
Gellor accepted the documents carefully, flipping through them for a second, then tucking them into his tunic.  He then gazed at Vashaar expectantly.  "And…?"
<br><br>
Vashaar frowned, then reached into his robes and pulled out a sack of coins, tossing them to the Bard as if he did not want to touch it.
<br><br>
"Treachery isn't cheap, Favoured One.  I thank you for your time and business."  Gellor bowed deeply again, then stepped from the room.
<br><br>
"Distasteful work, treachery," mumbled Aezar wryly, shaking his head.
<br><br>
Vashaar leveled his gaze on Aezar, his eyebrow arched, then frowned and stepped from the room.
