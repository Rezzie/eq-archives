					<p></p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2>1. What are dedicated servers?</h2></div>

					<p>A dedicated server offers you the opportunity to be your own site administrator and allows you to manage your own server, resources, users, and services.</p>
					
					<p>Dedicated servers are incredibly flexible to meet your advanced hosting needs. Run Active Server Pages, Cold Fusion, database applications, chat servers, mail system applications, stream media and more.</p>
					
					<p>A dedicated server is yours to use exclusively, so you have 100% of the processor and 100% of the available disk space working for you. Additionally, the bandwidth for the server is 100% yours. You are not sharing your bandwidth with anyone else.</p>

					<p>To maximize network uptime, your SimpleNet Server is connected to the
					  Internet via four backbone providers.</p>
					
					<p>These providers include:</p>
					
					<ul>
					    <li>Sprint - DS3</li>
						   <li>Level3 - DS3</li>
						   <li>Verizon - DS3</li>
					       <li>XO Communications - 100MB</li>
			        </ul>
					
					<p>In addition to providing this high level of redundancy, our sophisticated routing techniques ensure that your data will take the fastest, most reliable path to the Internet. There are no specific limitations on how many domains can be hosted on your server. Any limitations are related to the hardware capacity of the machine.</p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2>2. Where is the server located?</h2></div>

					<p>Our Access Center is a world-class facility and was the first of its kind in San Diego, California. Completed in March 1998, our 2,000 square foot, 150 rack Access Center meets the high security and protection demands of any Internet presence. The Access Center has fire suppression and redundant systems for connectivity, electrical power, and air conditioning.</p>

					<p>We monitor our Access Center 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and 365 days per year. Our staff is committed and trained to provide you with continual, high-level network monitoring and load management of your connection. In addition, we offer engineering support for outage response, network performance analysis, and network planning.</p>
					
					<p>The Access Center features fault tolerant power utilizing a redundant APC Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system with 160 KVA total capacity. The UPS will provide power until our 450kW diesel generator starts up and carries the electrical load. Our generator can run indefinitely as our 250 gallon fuel tank is re-fueled from the street. Each rack has its own dedicated circuit that is "conditioned" by the UPS before powering any equipment.</p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2>3. How many domains/email accounts can I have?</h2></div>

					<p>Our servers have been known to host an extremely high number of domains and can several hundred web sites. The number of sites will vary depending on the amount of resources each uses.</p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2>4. What kind of technical support is offered?</h2></div>

					<p>The Simplenet Dedicated Servers Service is an advanced program for customers who are looking for more flexibility with their hosting needs and are comfortable being their own server administrator.</p>
					
					<p>Technical support is offered 24/7/365 through email or telephone.</p>
					
					<p>Each SimpleNet dedicated server includes 24/7 year round monitoring at no additional charge. SimpleNet will also reboot servers upon request at no charge. Should a customer's server require reinstallation of the operating system, SimpleNet will reformat and reinstall the operating system for a $100.00 per incident fee.</p>
					
					<p>SimpleNet provides technical support for: adding and deleting domains, host names, users, and FTP accounts; starting and stopping of web and FTP services; enabling and disabling of logging. SimpleNet does not offer support for some advanced features, not included in the web interface, that require familiarity with Linux and typical Linux services.</p>
