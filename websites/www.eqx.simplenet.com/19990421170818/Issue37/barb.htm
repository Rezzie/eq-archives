The Barbarian warrior lurched over the crow, and applied the fatal last blow to the Scarecrow's skull.  The scarecrow gasped his last breath and dropped to the ground.  
<br><br>
The party members savagely looted the corpse, taking the few coins he had.  Probably pocketed from the poor innocent victims he had claimed since morning.  
<br><br>
Jalen stood over his victim looking proud.  "Too easy!" He said with a grin.
<br><br>
Jalen, a Barbarian warrior, wore large suited chain mail about his body.  In both hands he wielded a longsword.  He was an impressive looking warrior.  Standing next to Jalen, waving her arms in a circular motion, Jora, a female Barbarian began to heal his wounds with her Shaman magic.  "Easy for who?"  She said with a sexy smile.
<br><br>
Jora also worn full chain armor, which fit tightly to her body.   She was obviously very strong, as the chain could not hide the outlines of her muscles.  In her hands she wield a huge staff.  She was very sexy, but also VERY big!
<br><br>
"Well I, for one, am petrified of those things!  You two just keep them away from me."  I said with a half joking, half-serious look.  "I'll continue to be the brains of this operation."  
<br><br>
They both laughed.  
<br><br>
I shrugged them both off, and continued to search through the corpse for more items.  
<br><br>
As I was searching I began to feel my body vibrate ever so slightly.   It was a rhythmic sound.  I stopped what I was doing and looked up at the two of them, towering above me.
<br><br>
"How much farther do we…"   Jora stopped in mid sentence.  
<br><br>
"Do you hear that?"  I questioned.  
<br><br>
<b><em>POUND, POUND, POUND.</em></b>  The sound grew louder.  
<br><br>
I scanned over the cornfield, which revealed nothing.   Only a few birds could be seen flying high above us.  
<br><br>
The sound grew louder.
<br><br>
It was then that I caught a glimpse of a head bobbing up from behind a distant hill.  The head seemed to bob with the sound of each thump we heard.      
<br><br>
"Um.  Gu.. gu.. Guys."  I stuttered.   
<br><br>
"Wow!"  Jora said with excitement as she stared.  
<br><br>
The rest of the creature's torso came into view, as he cleared over the hill.  A massive looking beast, it had two huge arms attached at his shoulders.  Each arm was as big as my entire body.  It had to be at least twenty feet tall.    In its right hand he carried a club, which he was swinging at this side. Saliva dripped from the corners of his mouth making it obvious we were to be his lunch.  He had almost a humanly look. 
<br><br>
"HILL GIANT RUN!" Jalen commanded.  "Run for your lives!"
<br><br>
Not really sure in what direction, I turned and ran.  
<br><br>
I could hear his footsteps behind me growing louder.  With each foot, of the Hill giant, to hit the ground, I was bounced into the air.  I could hear him roaring, and smelled his putrid breath behind me.  It was then that I felt the full might of this creature's blow, as his club caught me square in the head.   Blackness started to take over my brain as I dropped to the ground.  Then somehow not loosing consciousness, I climbed to my feet and continued to run.  Just when I was sure I was going to die I caught, in the distance, a tall white tower.  Yes it was the guard tower we had passed when travelling out here.  I'm saved!   I ran up to the tower to inform the guards of my situation.
<br><br>
"RIGHT HERE RIGHT HERE!!  Heeeeeeeeeeeelp!"  I screamed.  
<br><br>
Four surprised guardsman looked up from their conversation to see me running towards them with a house chasing me.
<br><br>
After an intense battle, and the loss of one guardsman, the hill giant was defeated.  I entered the tower to find my two friends sitting on the ground laughing amongst themselves.  I sat down beside them.
<br><br>
"So what took you so long?" Jalen and Jora said in unison, as they laughed.  
<br><br>
Damn Barbarians!
