Okay, boys and girls, let’s discuss the most neglected, most misunderstood, least discussed part of role-playing online.  Boys role-playing girls and girls role-playing boys.
<br><br>
(Segue into one of my patented hypothetical scenarios.  Use any &quot;dream&quot; sequence or &quot;flashback&quot; special effect you like.)
<br><br>
Hergon and Ulya have been playing together for two weeks now and it’s been a blast.  Hergon has been standing up front and taking the heavy-duty hits from the &quot;yellow&quot; level beasties, while Ulya has been tossing out those enchantments to buff up our hero and casting those stinging spells to bring the foe to its knees.
<br><br>
&quot;So, Ulya, are you going to be playing for a while?&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Yes, Hergon, but I’ve got to switch servers to play with my guild, the Grimm Dwarves.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Aren’t they Male Dwarves only?&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Yes, they are.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;You know, I’ve thought about playing an opposite sex character, but I’ve never tried it.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;I do it most of the time.  Gotta go!  Bye!&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;But wait!  I thought you said you played Ulya… most… of … the … time?&quot;
<br><br>
Poof.  Ulya leaves and Hergon is left with a puzzled feeling.  Why should it matter that Ulya is a guy?  Except maybe that he feels deceived.  It’s not that they were having anything more than some online monster-bashing fun, but he feels lied to.
<br><br>
There are actually lots of opinions about role-playing opposite sex characters.  I’ve read many.  They seem to fall into three camps:
<br><br>
<UL>
<LI>Why not?  It’s only a game.</LI>
<LI>It’s fine for others, but not for me. (This seems to be the largest group)</LI>
<LI>Freaks!  You must be a degenerate to pretend you’re another sex.</LI></UL>

<br>
<B>Why Not?  It’s only a Game.</B>
<br><br>
Good Question.  Let’s say you’re the type of person to call 976 lines (One of those naughty &quot;spank me&quot; lines).  So you’re having a discussion with Imelda, who says she’s going to spank you with her size 11 black leather pumps.
<br><br>
Size 11, you question?  Oh, I mean size 6, she answers.  Yes.  That’s the ticket.
<br><br>
Should you be surprised that Imelda is big boned?  It’s not to say that people who work 976 lines aren’t all busty, blonde, horny, 18 year old nymphets, but isn’t it far more likely that someone like that someone like that would be out with her boyfriend(s), not talking on the phone to a stranger?  It’s just slightly more plausible that the mystery woman is indeed a housewife from Michigan with an overbite and thick glasses from a severe stigmatism.  She keeps saying she’s going to get back into shape after delivering those three kids, but she just can’t find the time between her baking duties, picking the kids up from soccer practice, and spanking lonely men with her collection of 1000 imaginary pairs of shoes.
<br><br>
Fact is, you know what you’re getting when you log on, same as you know what you’re getting when you talk to someone on 976-SHOE-ME.  On a phone line, you know that isn’t the woman in the ad.  On the internet, you know it’s not a blonde, busty wood elf punching those keys at the other end.
<br><br>
<b>It’s Fine for Others, But Not For Me</b>
<br><br>
Oh, says Archanalia, as he paws through the brochure &quot;So you’ve decided to be a virtual woman&quot;, desperately hoping to find an argument either for or another against this statement.
<br><br>
Fact is, live and let live would be a much better national motto than, &quot;Be like us or we’ll bomb you back to the Stone Age&quot;.  (Don’t get me wrong, I like bombs.  Bombs rock.  Where would most video games be without them?)
<br><br>
My point is that playing a woman is like playing a dwarf.  I’ve never in my life assumed that any &quot;female&quot; I’ve met online was indeed a woman, and I’ve never assumed that any Dwarf I met online was truly a dwarf, although I suppose it’s possible.  EverQuest is a role-playing game, where you act like something you’re not.  That’s not to say that you don’t want to be a man.  Heck, I couldn’t really imagine being a woman in real life.  Sounds like hell.  (No offense ladies).  As I see it, the only benefit women have in real life is that they can be lesbians.
<br><br>
…Yehhhhhh, lesbians…
<br><br>
Oh, wait… Don’t go away.  I’m back now.  I’ll try again to make my point in a way that doesn’t offend at least 50 percent of the population.  Online, playing a woman is just a role.  I don’t assume that when I see an actor playing someone gay in a movie that the actor really is gay.  In fact, it seems that the actors that are gay are playing heterosexuals.
<br><br>
Didn’t make my point, did I?  Well, maybe I’ll do better with the next category.
<br><br>
<B>Freaks!  You must be a degenerate to pretend you’re another sex.</B>
<br><br>
I think that when I was 15 this is what I would have said.  Fact is, to be a game master in most paper RPGs, you must play female characters.  It’s a requirement.  Who’d want to play, &quot;MACHO:  The all male role-playing game&quot; because the GM was homophobic and wouldn’t handle the female NPCs?  (What good is having imaginary muscles to flex if you can’t impress the imaginary babes?.)  Since you are controlling the world, you are controlling half of its population.  As GM you get plenty of practicing playing the other half of the world.
<br><br>
That’s how I started out playing female characters.  Eventually, half of my player characters were female.  They still are, in fact.  Choosing male or female characters is the same as choosing a race; You have to look at it as a character trait.
<br><br>
Hmmm.  I’ve decided my character is moody, quiet, brooding, and prone to quick flashes of anger when their intelligence is insulted.  Now, Male or female?  I’ve seen plenty of male characters like this.  Maybe I should make a female!
<br><br>
Writing has the same basis as roleplaying, and should be evidence that the gender barrier is easy to surmount.  How does a scriptwriter decide what the female protagonist does next?  He’s playing that thought in his head.  &quot;If I were her, I’d….&quot;
<br><br>
Fact is, if you have the opinion which headlines this section of my article, then I do have a lesser opinion of you.  (I’m sure that wounds you deeply.)  And for the few times I’ve played a female character in EverQuest, I’ve never been mistaken for a woman.  This is good.  It means that people are Internet savvy.  You can’t believe anything you see online.
<br><br>
But there is one truth to all this.  While EverQuest has more female players than perhaps any other online game I’ve ever played, the ratio still swings well in favor of male players.  That makes the in-game population disproportional.  If men only played men and women only played women, then you’d see a marked difference in the population’s makeup (No pun intended).
<br><br>
<B>How To Play a Character of the Opposite Sex</B>
<br><br>
Perhaps the most difficult thing to explain.  You see, if I tell you to behave like you THINK that the opposite sex behaves, then all the female-played Male characters would go around belching, scratching their butts, and sitting around the compound demanding that the women go make them a turkey sandwich.  And the male-played female characters would run screaming from the large rats and would only be magic-using characters because lifting heavy weapons isn’t &quot;their thing&quot;.
<br><br>
Part of making a memorable character is tossing out the stereotypes and making something more original.  I’ve played games where all the big frontline &quot;tanks&quot; were women and the clerics and mages were men.  Simply put, the best way to go is to just make up a personality, then decide if it’s more interesting as a man or as a woman.
<br><br>
Incidentally, there’s one other reason to play the opposite sex online.  This is a sociological reason.  Try it once just to see how people treat you.  I’ve not experienced any different treatment, but then I generally have a high opinion of the folks with whom I’ve played EverQuest.  They know that a character is just a character, and that being evil and wicked online doesn’t typically translate to real life.  Again, I can’t say it enough, but these are just characters.  Be dynamic, regardless of what sex you are playing and what sex you are.
<br><br>
Incidentally, my most successful character to this point is still my beta character… a female barbarian shaman.
<br><br>
I can’t tell you how to play a woman any more than I can tell you how to eat your lunch.  Each character is an individual and should be acted out with some flair and intensity.
<br><br>
I don’t think I’ve helped you necessarily with &quot;how&quot; to play an opposite sex character, but I hope I’ve removed some of the stigma attached to it.
