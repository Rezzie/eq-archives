<p style="text-align: justify">

	I have spent many an hour reading message boards debating this very old argument.  One side declaring flame wars on the other, without either side allowing the other to win.  I feel it is time to put my two cents in edgewise and hopefully clear up some foggy areas of the debate.
<br><br>
	First off I will start off by saying that I agree with both sides on certain points that have been made, but do not whole-heartedly embrace either.  I have played with both types of players, and a hybrid of the two.  My recent online role playing experience is limited to a few titles, but I feel that I have a pretty good grip on what is going on in most minds when it comes to this argument.
<br><br>
	When comparing role playing to power gaming you must take into consideration that there is a little bit of power gaming in role playing.  You do not just play the game to assume a role, or to escape from your reality that you are trapped in.  There has to be a time when you add up your experience, level up your character and get excited about new abilities, and that is a form of power gaming.
<br><br>
	I know when I finished a campaign in any of the pen and paper games I participated in, I was always the first in line to see if I gained a new experience level and how it affected my character's performance.  During the campaign though, I was probably one of the more efficient role players in the groups I journeyed with.  Changing my demeanor to that of the character I was playing at that time, and making sure to incorporate all of the quirks into my persona so I would be believable. 
<br><br>
	A lot of you may disagree with this, but if you do not enjoy watching your character grow, than what attracts you to role playing games?  This goes the same for straight power gamers.  Why play role playing games if all you want to do is play it like an action title?  Well, I think I have an answer to both of those questions.
<br><br>
	Lets look at the question to the role players first.  I know it is extreme amounts of fun to assume roles in a gaming environment, but is that satisfaction enough to keep you playing a game?  I would have to say no.  There has to be some sort of advancement to keep you interested in the game.  Your interest in that role, if there wasn't any advancement, would become minute after a short period of time due to the fact that there is no room for growth. 
<br><br>
	As a character grows in experience, his personality may change and I am sure his goals and directives will change along with it.  During these growth periods, which involve looking at stats and skills and how they have progressed, you change your character's outlook on life.  So, in essence power gaming is a viable part of the role playing experience.
<br><br>
	Now lets take a look at pure power gaming.  I feel that most pure power gamers do it because they have never experienced the pleasure of pen and paper rpg's where you have to rely a lot upon the imagination.  Their idea of role playing is fighting all the evil monsters and leveling up so they can go to the next area to kill more of the evil monsters.  They use rpg's as an advanced form of the action genre because there is more character growth and more depth than the average action game.  Which I can not blame them for doing it, because action games become boring very fast, whereas rpg's have a longer shelf life.
<br><br>
	There is also another type of gamer included in this argument.  The hybrid gamer.  A player who likes to assume his role, but at the end of the session, enjoys just as much looking over his stats and how he has advanced.  I know it is hard for role players to admit, but if it wasn't for the growth in power via gaining new spells, a damage bonus, or just a magic item that enhances your stats or skills, they would quickly grow bored of a game, or that character in question.  Whereas the hybrid gamer enjoys both aspects and probably has a lot more fun playing the game, than just being one or the other.
<br><br>
	Neither side is wrong in what they do, but arguing about it will not help anyone out.  We must acknowledge that online gaming is never going to be specific to one type of gamer, but will be accessed by many different types who will treat the game the way they wish too.  If we could all just accept this, than the game could be taken to another level.  If we keep arguing about it, nothing will be accomplished.  
<br><br>
	Maybe those power gamers are just afraid of sounding stupid when trying to role play. Then again, those role players feel stupid admitting that they like looking at their stats. Who knows?  Until we can put away our differences, neither side will win.  I hope I have hit on some points that everyone has been thinking about, and for any new gamers, I hope I have given you a reason to look into both sides of the role playing genre.
