<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am in a group and I /con a creature, is the ensuing information related to just me attacking that creature or does the game take into account the combined might of my group?  I have successfully killed several tombstone creatures this way.<br>
- Dragadier, Bertoxxoulos
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;/Con takes into account only you, not the might of the entire group.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets say I go up a level.  Lets also say I learn a new skill.  If I die and lose a level, do I also loose the skill?<br>
- Anatol
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You will not lose the skill, but you will not be able to use it until you advance to the next level again.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In my brief excursions outside the great darkness of Neriak I have heard rumors of a goddess of this idea the lightbringers call love.  I am curious...where can I learn of this deities teachings?  I feel a stirring in my heart that I cannot explain.<br>
- Lisette of Fennin Ro
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goddess you speak of is Erollisi Marr, my own heart's queen.  The best place to find her is to listen to that small whisper in your heart, and follow where it leads.  Be warned… the path of love is oft bestrewn with thorns, but well worth the cost at the end.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any real consequences to leaving unlooted creature corpses lying about?  Aside from the obvious health hazards of leaving rotting corpses on the ground, I have heard that such sloppy work slows the return of new creatures to the area.  Is there any truth to this rumor?<br>
- Fitzroy

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't slow the respawn rate, as I have observed with my own eyes.  It can slow the frame rate of our friends with lower-end systems, and personally, I find it annoying.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I just recently entered the world of Norrath and one of my first actions was to fall into a lake and drown. How do you stay afloat and swim? I know it's a skill but I couldn't find a button to swim, like I have for run, sit, etc. Thanks.<br>
- Molson

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel your pain.  Drowning was one my own painful learning experiences in Norrath.  To swim:  look up, and then simply move forward, as if you were walking.  It takes a bit to get used to it, but soon, you'll be paddling around like a duck.  Happy splashing!
