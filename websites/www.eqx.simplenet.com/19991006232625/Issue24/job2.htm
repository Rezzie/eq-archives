<u>Skills</u> (#5) List everything you can do with a computer.  You can install
programs, update drivers, any word-processing programs you can use.  This
shows you have an ability to learn. 
<br><br>
I recommend reading a few books.  I found beginner books on topics like
TCP/IP, routing, Unix, NT, Novell were very helpful.  Make sure they are
not too advanced.  You'll be bored to death and won't learn a thing.
<br><br>
The most important goal here is to learn the buzzwords in your field.  No
employer likes to train an employee starting from scratch.  It's a bonus if
you're already initiated.  If you have friends that are already working in
the field, attempt conversations using your newfound knowledge.

<b>Finding the Right Company</b>
<br><br>
A central help desk is a great place to start in a career in MIS or
Networking.  You will be subjected to about every situation you can imagine.
You'll probably spend a year on this desk, and you will bring from it more
experience than you can imagine, and believe it or not, you can earn up to
$30,000 per year doing this.  Not bad for you're first job.  I call this time
period "boot camp".
<br><br>
The first job you land is a stepping stone. There are a couple things you
need to insure you are getting from your first position.
<br><br>
1. <b>Continual Training.</b>  Specialty schools.  This might be a couple one-week
courses a year.

2. <b>Peer support.</b>  I found that my best learning experience came from
shadowing a co-worker that had been working in networking for years.  I
cannot tell you the amount of knowledge I gained from working with him on day
to day networking issues.  If your co-workers are to busy, and you find
yourself at a desk alone, reading training manuals, your probably not going
to get much out of this job.  
<br><br>
3. Headhunters are also useful in finding jobs.  You'll find that most of the
advertisements in the want ads are headhunters anyway.  So don't be afraid to
talk to them.  You do however want to make sure that they don't charge you
for their service.  They should get their money from finders fees from your
future employer's, not from your pocket.  
<br><br>
4. Make sure the company is large enough to advance.  Every project I work on
is a bullet on my resume for my next advancement within my company.
