    Sony has finally given us our first real taste of what EverQuest will be like.&nbsp; All
    the comments about Sony's EverQuest Movie have been raves!&nbsp; Finally, after all the
    discussions, and comments from the EverQuest development team, we have something we can
    sink our teeth into.<br>
    <br>
    The movie is really a grouping of short clips; basically, showing the same character
    (except in the case of the dark elf thrown in) moving through various terrains, a couple
    of spells cast, with a few monsters also included to give us a glimpse as to what we will
    have to face.&nbsp; The movie finally ends with a battle between this same character and a
    Red Dragon!<br>
    <br>
    I must say that the movement was superb!&nbsp; Smooth, steady, with some
    nice,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;well &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rounded,&nbsp;&nbsp;
    character</td>
    <td width="34%" align="left"><p style="text-align: justify">limb<big><big> </big></big>movement
    as well.&nbsp; In addition, I found the monsters to have nice definition, and movement
    also.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, the Red Dragon at the end was superb!&nbsp; This is what a dragon should look
    like...&nbsp; Roughly 4 times the height of the player character (<em>Ed: I think it was
    more like 20 times the height</em>), and I would guess at 10-15 times the mass!&nbsp; Now,
    I have heard some complaints that the dragon was too easy to kill, only taking 1 sword
    strike, and a couple of fireball blows, however, as was also pointed out, what was
    displayed in the movie was actually only the opening blow, and then the death strike.
    &nbsp; This sequence was edited down to keep the movie size as small as possible.<br>
    <br>
    All in all, I would have to say that the EQ development team did a phenomenol
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;job&nbsp;&nbsp; with &nbsp;&nbsp;this &nbsp;movie,</td>
    <td width="33%" align="left"><p style="text-align: justify">and the<big><big> </big></big>timing
    couldn't have been better, only a day or so after the projected release date of the closed
    beta applications.&nbsp; These clips went a long way to keep the large following that EQ
    has already developed happy, and content, at least for a little while longer.<br>
    <br>
    Some of the things that I think we can look forward to in the next movie are much more
    detail on spell casting, and a larger variety; more depth, and variety on the monsters to
    be encountered; and possibily some PC and NPC interaction.&nbsp; These are the issues that
    will keep the EQ fans appeased until the open beta release.<br>
