<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering as to the special names for the various races of elves.  I know they each have a name to themselves and others, but does anyone have a list of what they each are?
<br>
Tabbran Kythrandraal
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well wouldn't you know, despite me teasing about rangers who always get lost, Crav, a ranger who never gets lost, comes through to fill in my spotty knowledge on the old names of the various elves.  The Teir'Dal are the dark elves who apparently aren't nearly as dreadful as I thought they were since they do so love romance and picnics (see below).  The Feir'Dal are the woodelves who are fair indeed and who for some extremely strange reason seem to have placed bunkbeds in many of their buildings.  It's an interior design decision that both horrifies and mystifies me.  As if any elf or half-elf would ever choose to sleep alone in such an aesthetic atrocity?  Perhaps someone has an explanation for this?   The Koa'Dal are the high elves who are supposed to be so wise but don't even seem to have a back door to their city?  Or did I miss it?  I tried to get a lovesick troll in Freeport to tell me if the trolls had any special name for the elves but all I could get from the noise she made were two words suspiciously translatable as "diet" and "food".    I hope this answers your questions as beyond these comments, I don't know other names that elves may use for themselves or the other elven races and would gladly be enlightened about it.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;On some of the buildings there is a smeared image, ie. the towers on the cliffs in E. Karana, that if you hit it at the right angle look like a human face. This splotch can also be seen in various other locations. Now is this my imagination or is there a graphic artist having a little fun?
<br>
Ructer Truestrike
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think your sharp eyes have detected one of at least several repeated facial patterns found throughout Norrath.  I am always amazed to come upon new examples of (mostly) symbolic portraiture as I travel.  This is a chance to encourage everyone to look up, down and around no matter where they are, as they will find painted and incised artwork and symbols throughout the land.  The graffiti artists, especially those in the Qeynos catacombs, could use a little help with their spelling and sometimes it'd be really nice if they extended their color sense just a bit beyond blood red, but nonetheless, artists, ancient and contemporary, have left evidence of their skills throughout Norrath.   I hope you continue to enjoy their work.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the "Rogue: A Tale of Trechery" ever going to be published in it's full version? Not with the end, but all the episodes so far in a .doc or .txt?
<br>
Aborice
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh what a wonderful idea.  I can't answer that but perhaps if the fans of A Tale of Treachery would flood Absor with requests that could happen someday.  *Grins and waits for the editor's pen to fall.*
<br><br>
<em>[Ed. - *looks around nervously*  That grin always makes me jumpy...  Well, I can certainly do that.  Actually, while it sounds like a lot of work for me, it seems like a good idea for me to do something like that for all of our longer stories.  But, for now, I'm only promising to look into it.]</em>

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What's the diffrence between the PvP and the PvP teams server? I would like to create a character on one but I need to know the diffrence first, which one tends to have more Role-Playing?
<br>
Silimar the 3rdHigh elf, City of Felwithe, Brell Serilis Server
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially I think you will see a lot of roleplaying whichever pvp route you choose to follow, especially if you are roleplaying yourself.  The pvp server, Rallos Zek, is the most established as it has been in the game since early in release.  This is a server where any player can kill or attempt to kill another other player, regardless of race or class.  It is not totally a free-for-all and basic rules are enforced by the GMs and guides.  The pvp teams servers, Tallon Zek and Rallon Zek, were created for pvp roleplay and smiting by race.  Thus, when you create a character there, you will find you automatically are part of a team with two other races.  As part of that team you cannot kill any other member of it, i.e. a half elf may not kill either a wood elf or a high elf.  However, you may kill any other race in Norrath and you'll probably find it healthy to band together with those of your team for protection and for adventure.  These servers also have a basic set of rules, different from either Rallos Zek or the non-pvp servers, which must be followed in game play.   I can't honestly say which of these servers has more roleplay so I'd suggest you try them out and see what you think!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pah. The bard criticizes us rangers for getting them lost. At least you don't find us toying with lutes in the midst of a heated battle with evil. (grin)
<br><br>
Anyway, on the topic of the Flame Lick, it was interesting to hear the opinion that it is a very useful spell. I agree, however, not too long ago the spell was changed to require a fire beetle eye as a reagent. I am not sure if the eye is actually used up or not, but I would assume so. Considering that they are not stackable, this reduces the overall usefullness of the spell. However, it still has it's definate uses.
<br>
Famien
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a small druid character that must use a fire beetle eye for flame lick too and haven't yet had to replace one so I'm not sure if they will eventually wear out or not.  As for rangers getting bards lost, well it is possible that the ones I have grouped with have a peculiar propensity for a more wandering style of travel, so I do hope that no rangers have taken offense.  I've yet to see a bard toying with a lute in battle, but then again, if some rangers lose themselves in the woods then perhaps some bards are kindred spirits who lose themselves in their music.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually not a question, rather confirmation.
<br><br>
"Hmmm, this is a headscratcher for me too. A  cleric friend of mine explained it like this:  When you gain a new skill, it starts at a number  equal to the level at which you receive it."
<br><br>
I just learned Kick as 7th level Ranger (a bit of omission on my side). First improvement in Kick was to level 8.
<br>
Regards, Avari the Halfhuman
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for taking the time to write in and confirm the cleric's advice.  Of course he would harrumph and then say, "Well of course, that's what I said, " but it never hurts to doublecheck on advice.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a previous issue, a young Tier'Dal was asking for a good date locale.  After much thought, I'd have to suggest Dangor's Cauldron, particularly at night.  It's a bit tough to get to as you'll need to get through Freeport and Butcherblock, but I think it would be worth the trip.
<br><br>
You have cold, majestic peaks overlooking deep blue waters, with only a few adventurers to distract you.  If you wish solitude, head to the east side near (but not too near) the Orc camps, or if you would prefer a spectacle, mount the eastern peaks overlooking the Goblin camp.  There will be a steady trickle of traffic moving to and from Unrest, and the occasional party harrassing the Goblin encampment.  If you are patient, such parties almost inevitably meet their end when one of the Aqua Goblin Lords bestir themselves to patrol the area.  You may also find it amusing to watch clumsy or unwary travelers hurl themselves to their deaths as they run off of the cliffs, particularly after "blessing" them with the boon of a Spirit of the Wolf or other speed-enhancing enchantment.
<br>
Troas
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, it sounds like you have spent many a romantic night there and certainly understand what will make a dark elf's heart flutter and then beat erratically and wildly.  Thank you for your advice.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer to the 'how to make a whip' in Issue 93:Whoever posted that question, I hope you are reading this.  Was the fail message "Those items did not combine in those quantities" or "You did not have enough skill to produce anything", or something similar?  If it was the first, try a silk swatch and a whip pattern in a kit.  To make a swatch, put two Spider Silks (not spiderling) in a kit and Combine.  If it was the latter, then you had the right combination and just need to practice tailoring (FYI I think swatches are 15 when you wont get any more skill)

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing in and clarifying the possibilities here.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Response to a letter in the Q&A section, Issue 92:I have a comment for Coventina, who was dismayed about the loss of metal studs while making studded armor.  In RL I make leather armor for a medieval recreation group.  When using studs, they are hammered into the leather, flattening them, and rendering them unrecycleable. To remove them from the armor requires ripping them out of the leather with metal clamps, damaging them further. I have yet to get up enough gumption to go to studded myself in EQ, but I have a feeling I'll be just as frustrated when I do!  Take care, and thanks for a great zine!
<br>
 Ariadne, Ranger of Tunare
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks so much for writing and sharing your knowledge of making studded leather armor.  I hope this helps Coventina too :)
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;On quivers:  I purchased a quiver based on the same premise as you printed in your last issue (Auto loading of different arrow types).  As of at least a couple weeks ago auto loading of different arrow types does not work.
<br>
Anian Barkskin
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad you tried it out even if it didn't work for you.  *Quivers at the prospect of still not knowing for sure what, if anything, quivers are good for!*  If anyone makes an  up-to-date test of this with all kinds of arrows, store-bought, looted and/or fletched, would you let me know?  Thanks!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;:  I was just curious if anyone has figured out the critical hit formula for warriors.  Im pretty  sure its based of offensive capability.  But I'am curious if anyone has figured out what else effects it.  I thought at first it was the weapon skills, but I got a critical hit of 25 with my bow the other day (archery=2).
<br><br>
AS for the question on healing it never gives you a number of how much you healed.  But Healing (lvl 14 cleric spell) starts at a hundred hp and goes up slightly with you level increase.  Light Healing (lvl nine cleric spell) heals right around 50 hitpoints to start and raises slightly with level.  So it appears to double each time the spell is raised so I can only assume the next heal with heal 200.
<br><br>
As too the comment in issue 93 on the studded armor the best place to hunt the wolves for medium pelts is Qeynos Hills (some rangers and druids take offense and challenge you).  I found every one in four had a medium or high quality pelt.  There are also two high level npcs (Holly Windstalker and Treestalker?)  who will kill you if they see you attacking wolves or bears.  There are also rabid wolves and grizzlies close to the guard tower.  Well hope that helps.
<br>

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Okies,  the looks the grizzled cleric gave me as I interrupted his concentration during a battle, weren't the friendliest ( oops! ), but still his talents are such that he can heal and answer bard questions simultaneously.  Very useful and I thank him for his help.  Anyway, the cleric says that he believes that critical hits are based on dexterity, very much the same way the procs from magical weapons are.  Hopes this helps you.  Thank for you comments on healing and on wolfhunting.  The name of that other fellow who would rather kill you than allow you to hunt wolves or bears escapes me at the moment.  I know that tonight the patrons of whichever  tavern I end up at will be jolted sober when I remember the name and jump up and shout it out in triumph.  Treestalker is not it but hopefully we'll remember the name soon.
<br><br><br>


Thanks to you all for writing with your questions and comments.  I really enjoy hearing from you all.  A small update on the rumors column of two issues ago:  I did indeed brave the wild thrashings and bashings of the lovesick troll and later in the evening, when she was too tired to chase me and I was too tired to run anymore, we shared tales as we sat, exhausted, sipping our favorite brews.  Her plight drew my sympathy as it may yours when, one day, you hear why she tore up the streets of Freeport.  As for reporters and editors who have "important" work to do, um, next time at least give me some JBoots so I can run and heal at the same time.  Please!
