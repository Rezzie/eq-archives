There are moments in Halas where I am sure that I am in the home of the gods, despite what all the myths may say.  Even here amid the igloos, the evening sky turned ashen gray by the thick blanket of clouds, that even these miserable goblin homes can seem almost sainted.  The snow tumbling from the sky, the winter chill.

<p style="text-align: justify">
I wonder if they didn't think the same thing.
<br><br>
The ice goblins are less a threat to the heroically brave warriors of Halas than they are to themselves.  I've seen the little tykes charge groups of warriors and be struck down with a few blows.
<br><br>
I am Gvarn, and I was born here, in the snow.  My mother and father were trying to get back to their ancestral home of Halas after spending years in the south, along the shores of the Kara Plains in a fishing village.  When my mother became pregnant they felt it would be easier to raise a child in the place that birthed them both, where our kinsmen can instruct and befriend the fledgling child who would be me.
<br><br>
We didn't make it all the way back before I insisted on coming into the world.  My foster parent tells the story that they found me in one of the goblin igloos, wrapped in skins, lying amid the belongings that had belonged to my parents.  It is believed that when the snowfall came in heavy layers they decided that the igloos would be the only available shelter until after the storm.  And they 'evicted' the resident and put me in there.  And when my foster father came across the camp with his group they found a group of goblins outside the igloo, standing over the bodies of my parents, and slew them.  And that is when they heard me crying.
<br><br>
Naturally it is assumed that my parents were slain.  I never knew them.  All I've known are Astridia and Golnea, who took me in and raised me as their child.
<br><br>
The only way they knew where my parents came from is because of the weapons and goods they found with me, and the few scrolls on which my mother, a decidedly thoughtful woman, had written about their trek to the north lands.
<br><br>
So when I return to this camp and stare at the blocks of ice arrayed and stacked for protection, that I feel these pangs of loneliness.  Then one of the goblins comes home, and I feel rage.
<br><br>
I pull my mother's club from my belt and invariably charge them, no matter their number.  It's never more than three, and they are usually somewhat startled by my call in goblin: "I am your death, now worship me."
<br><br>
I learned the phrase when once as a child I entered a goblin cave and saw something similar scrawled on a wall.  I copied it best I could and took it to the village elder who transcribed it for me.  The actual phrase was "Worship death", but I managed to learn a little goblin from the elder and rearranged it to suit me.
<br><br>
Little did I know what effect it has on goblins to hear a human calling out in their language and swinging a tremendous club like a mad woman.
<br><br>
All of this explanation leads up to a description of an event it has taken much reflection to understand fully.
<br><br>
I had once again returned to my birthplace, my mother's club dangling from my belt.  Overhead the sky has turned that certain shade of ash where you know it is about to rupture and bleed snow all over the countryside.  And I looked at them, playing in the snow; two goblin whelps.  Just beyond them were two others, fully grown, and I stepped out into the clearing and began to cross the clearing.  I started at a walk and slowly picked up speed.
<br><br>
"I am your death, worship me!" I cried, my club swirling over my head by virtue of my wildly rotating right hand.  And they looked up at me in horror.  The whelps fell back on their tails and stared up at me.  The two larger ones dropped the block of ice they held (They were shoring up the igloo) and looked into my eyes, and they saw death.  I'm sure they saw it.  When I cast the right spell on myself then my rage becomes incredible, the spell building on what is already there.
<br><br>
Sometimes my hand becomes a separate entity.  I am merely thinking about their heads splintered and broken and suddenly it happens.  I wonder about how far the blood will spatter across the pristine snow, then it does.  In this case however, I wondered if I hadn't already achieved my vengeance.  I had slain dozens, perhaps hundreds of their kind, and for the first time ever, wondered if perhaps I weren't taking it all too far.
<br><br>
Had my spell failed?  Perhaps there was just not enough anger for it to enhance anymore.
<br><br>
And the club came down just between them and shattered the block of ice.  I could see my breath congeal in the air.  And then the most unexpected thing happened.
<br><br>
The two larger goblins dropped to their knees in an extreme bow.  The whelps followed suit.  For a moment I stood there, listening to what I think were prayers being spoken because they both said the same thing in unison; a litany of sorts.  And the snow fell.
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
We were all there for what seemed like an hour.  It seemed so long because I couldn't decide what to do next.  For as long as I stood there they continued to bow.  So it was my move now.
<br><br>
They were ice goblins in the midst of the snow drifts and glaciers of the barbarian north.  In other words they were not long meant for this world.  But their death would not come from me.  Not this day.
<br><br>
I turned and walked from the camp back towards where I had entered the clearing, and the prayer stopped.
<br><br>
They looked up at me from where they hugged the icy ground, and I simply stepped past he whelps and continued into the snowy night.
<br><br>
It wasn't until a year had passed and I had decided to visit my parent's death place and site of my birth that I returned.  In that time the igloos had fallen into disrepair.  Only one still fully stood.  Ice will keep almost forever but the wind had whittled away at the other igloo.  There were no goblin footprints to be found anywhere.
<br><br>
And so I knelt and crawled inside one of the igloos.  I was there for a while, listening for the sound of goblins, but there was nothing.  This place had been abandoned.  It was getting dark, so I lit my torch and began to crawl out.
<br><br>
That is when I saw the scribbling.  On the inside of the igloo, goblin claws had etched all over the surface of the ice.  Mostly they were warnings in goblin tongue that death haunts this place and to "beware".  But there was one drawing I recognized.  It was the drawing of a face that I had seen each morning as I washed my face in the well water.  It was crude, but the drawing had long hair and the same face paint I wore.
<br><br>
I suspect that somewhere in a goblin cave there is a family of ice goblins who sit around a fire with the rest of their community, as I do with my community.  They share tales of how death came to them out of the snow the way it had to all others who lived at their old home.  They looked into death's eyes and saw their demise, yet death spared them.
