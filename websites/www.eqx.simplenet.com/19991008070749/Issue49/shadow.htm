	The heavy scent of fish and salt water assaulted his main-lander's sensibilities as he made his way down the mist drenched portside avenue of Freeport. Despite days in the bustling city, he had grown no fonder of the stench of fish. He understood the necessity, however, and so bore it with discomfort. 
<br><br>
	He had to admit, the city was indeed a great launch pad for his career. With it's large population and oft-raucous crowd of sailors, the local authorities often had trouble keeping tabs on all it's less savory citizens. Though the lithe elf had no past record nor run ins with the city militia, most of the guards he had come across watched him with silent, judgmental eyes, begging for him to do something to give them an excuse to banish him -or worse- kill him.
<br><br>
	He had not, despite their silent urgings, and so he made his way this night towards the planed meeting place: a seedy tavern in the city's western quarter, alongside it's docks. He walked quietly, with barely a whisper as the gloom grew farther towards true night. His eyes, however, let him see all in the beautiful cascading heat patterns of Ultravision. The predominantly purple tint of his vision gave the city a surrealistic sense. Showing him that which none of the pathetic creatures around him could see, try as they might. He stuck to the shadows, depriving the local drunkards a view of his ebony skin and stark white hair hidden beneath the cowl of his baggy hood. 
<br><br>
	The white disk hung serenely in the star pocked sky as he stood across the broad avenue watching the poorly lit tavern. He wondered momentarily if his employer had arrived yet, the shadow was slightly early -as he was planning to be throughout his budding career- and hadn't made his presence known to the patrons in the loud establishment. He gazed about, searching for the fat pig who had hired his services but could not see his coach anywhere.
<br><br>
	A quite screech drew his eyes to the sign hanging above the door of the tavern, his eyes could not form words from the faded lines adorning it and he grinned mirthlessly at the carelessness humans tended to show. The grin quickly dissipated when he caught site of a large form bobbing down the avenue, huddling close to the buildings to use their shadows as cover, though his bulk was little diminished even in the waning light of the moon.
<br><br>
	The shadow quickly moved closer, hoping to stop his employer before entering the tavern. He winced as the obese merchant let out a cry of fright at his appearance and quickly shot a glance either way. Confident that none had been drawn to their presence, the Drow pulled the other deeper into the gloom of an ally.
<br><br>
	"You have drawn me here, Fen, what is it you want?" He asked of the still panting fat body.
<br><br>
	"I thank you, Shadow, for coming on such short notice." He replied between gasps. "I had hoped for an update on the status of your task..."
<br><br>
	The Drow's unbelieving stare bore into Fen with silent contempt. "You pulled me from the trail for that!" He cried, too loudly, and looked around.  "I told you before, Fen, you must not contact me unless it is of vital importance!"
<br><br>
	"I- I know. I...I just wanted to tell you that I wasn't sure anymore. That I-" The Drow's glare stopped him mid-stutter.
<br><br>
	"You aren't sure! I have been under your employ for three weeks, I had planned on taking the mark on the morrow and you tell me this now!?"  The Merchant nodded, albeit reluctantly and looked at his feet in chagrin. "You paid me to execute your wife, Fen. I have been following her for weeks, and now you are having doubts? You must know that I will not return the advance you paid, nor will I dismiss the expenditures I have wasted on this!"
<br><br>
	"Please, calm, I will pay you your due. I swear. But you must not complete the task!" Fen half begged, reaching for the Drow before coming to his senses and drawing his hands back as if burned. "50 platinum for expenditures." The Drow took a menacing step forward. "Okay! Okay! 100 platinum for expenditures!" The merchant conceded, reaching into his robes.
<br><br>
	In a blur, his large, meaty hand flashed back and drew something to his lips. Ample cheeks puffed and a high-pitched whistle filled the night air. The Drow, confused, stood staring at the seemingly mad merchant. He stood there for a second, wondering what the whistle had been all about, until the sound of booted feet -many booted feet- preceded the guards around the corner and into the ally where he and his employer stood. Fen had a broad grin upon his face as he took a few steps away from the infuriated Drow.
<br><br>
	"Treachery!" The Drow bellowed and drew a wicked looking blade from his sleeve, the merchant had enough time to feel true terror before the tip burst through his eye, his brain and out the back of his head. With a curse, the Drow ran deeper into the ally, searching for an escape. 
	<br><br>
	With startled eyes, the guards watch the graceful from leap to a nearby window ledge and pull himself up, then leap once more and again until he disappeared over the ledge of the roof, throwing a taunting laugh over his shoulder.
<br><br>
	"FIND him!" cried the lead guard as he turned back towards the entrance of the ally. "Runners!" He called and two young men bounded towards him, "Find the captain and tell him the Assassin has made good his escape. Inform him that he has taken to the rooftops and to have some mages brought in to get us some far-sight. MOVE!" The two runners peeled off in different directions, running full out.
<br><br>
	"Marchant!" The lead guard, Sergeant Balley, called to his corporal.
<br><br>
	"Sir!" Corporal Marchant pushed his way towards Sergeant Balley and saluted.
<br><br>
	"Take half the men and have them outfitted with bows and cross-bows. Send half of them east and the other half north. Then you head south and keep your eyes open for the evil Drow until you meet up with us!" Balley turned away before his corporal could respond and started bellowing orders to form two groups from the men he had with him. 
<br><br>
	A minute and a half after the Drow had vanished onto the rooftop, two groups of guards made their way in opposite directions. Ten minutes after that, the Drow looked back down into the ally and watched as two guards carried Fen's corpse away. When he was sure they were far off, he began to laugh, then slowly climbed back down. "Idiots" he whispered and made his way towards the port and onto a vessel headed for Kaladim in Faydwer...
