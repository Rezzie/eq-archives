<b> Game World </b>
<br><br>
EverQuest is trying to create a submersive world with a rich background.  
With their background story, deity list, and racial histories, they are 
succeeding beyond my expectations.  
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Asheron's Call is not so submersive.  Every player character
is a human.  That makes the development and balance easier, but the game
much less interesting.

To enter dungeons, you locate the entrance and walk into a swirling portal, 
after which you are plopped down into the dungeon.  Swirling portals are a 
cheesy way to get around developing the transitions and realistic entrances 
into other areas.  It also detracts from the submersive feel, because every 
time you warp through a portal you are reminded of how absurd it really is.

Now, Asheron's Call does try for some realism.  For example, after you fire a 
dozen arrows at your enemy, you can go pick up the ones you missed.  However, 
you need to click on each one individually and drag it to yourself.  Then you 
get to sit and watch as your character slowly meanders over, kneels down, and 
stands back up again.  That is not the kind of realism that makes a game fun!  
Hello?  
<br><br>
One more thing.  Have you heard about Asheron Call's background story? Funny, 
neither have I.
