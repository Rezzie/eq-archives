<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 7!</font></p>
<p align="justify">First off let me say that I owe you all an apology of sorts.  You may have noticed (or maybe not) that our readership seemed to have grown dramatically during Issue 6.  Well, it may not have.  I accidentally reloaded the site a bunch of times.  You see, I had the link open to the real site while I was working on the updated site.  So every time I refreshed the new site I would also refresh the old one…  I caught it pretty fast, so I don’t think I added more than a few dozen hits to Issue 6 and to the overall site hits.  So I am sorry if this misrepresents our readership.  At least Kit doesn’t know about it yet…   D’oh!
<br><br>
And again Kit is gone.  I have no idea about when he’ll be back, but I certainly hope it is soon.
<br><br>
Anyhow, I did my ranting for the week in an article, so I don’t have much to say here.  But PLEASE take a look at the new format and tell me what’s wrong with it.  I really do want to make EQX as good as it can be.  To do that I will need your help and criticism.  So let me have it.
<br><br>
Thanks for reading.
