<em>Please discuss death in EQ.  I am still confused as to this issue.  I know that you resurrect in town.  Are they looking at options for change?  Is there a ressurect spell?  What are some of the justifications or reasonings behind EQ's stance on death?<br>
Thx

Hmmm.  Justifications and reasoning.  You can't really ask us guess what lurks in the minds of Sony employees.  However, I can tell you some of how death in EQ works.  And I must say that if someone had told me about this before hand I would have felt there was no way it would work.  While it's not perfect, I do feel it's appropriate enough for the game.
<br><br>
As usual, I do my best explanation through example.  So here are two case studies-both of which happened to me using different characters.  The first is common, the second was really irritating.
<br><br>
DEATH OF A NEWBIE
<br><br>
Archanalia was in his first incarnation (phase Beta 2).  I had just gotten an enchanter and it started with one spell and minimal equipment.  So I spent easily (EASILY) an hour running around Qeynos looking for the enchanter's guild house.  When I at last found it I realized it was going to be nearly impossible to find it again.  It was going to take several trips there before I got the city wired.  Cities in EQ can be a bit confusing, but it really only takes a few trips to your guild before you understand it.  This, I feel, is realistic for starting characters.  I got some more equipment from the guild and trained in a few skills.
<br><br>
So Arch gets out of the city and finds a courtyard filled with lower level creatures and begins to take on them.  An epic battle with a snake lasted 5, possibly 8 minutes.  But I won and felt happy with the epic battle with this foe.  I healed then went after a beetle that was running around the courtyard.  Ooops!  This guy pinches hard.  Ouch!!  I've seen people run to the guards at the gates of Qeynos for help so I try to do this.  And I would have succeeded had another beetle not come to the aid of his brethren.  Between the two of them I was pinched to death at the gates.  I lay there dying and before the world went black I heard the two beetles dispatched by the town guard… too late to save me.
<br><br>
About a minute and a half later I am back at the starting point.  I checked my equipment and all my starting equipment was back.  I had to re-memorize my spell.  I traveled back to the courtyard and found my body and looted it.  Anybody who tried to loot it while I was gone simply got a message that they could "not loot that corpse".
<br><br>
Not an epic voyage, since newbies tend to die in or near their starting zone.  At low levels you do not loose skill, characteristics, or otherwise take a hit to your character.  Instead you have to go back and get your things.  If you were grouped with a bunch of others for adventuring purposes then you are knocked out of the group.  You can rejoin when you get back to them if you both would like. 
<br><br>
BOILED IN THE CAULDRON
<br><br>
Dagnor's Cauldron is a very forbidding landscape.  I'll spare you the (spoiler) description.  Phase 3 Archanalia, a 15th level character, finds himself in this unusual place and decides to poke around with pal Laenilus.  In the midst of scouting out a camp of orcs something goes terribly wrong and my lag leaps to epic levels and eventually I lag out of the game.
<br><br>
When I get back in, I am at my starting point… not a good sign.  I had died somehow.  If you are in motion and you lag out, you often continue in the same direction in which you were headed when you lagged out.
<br><br>
Laenilus tells me that he can't see my body anywhere.  So I figure I lagged out and walked into the orc camp.  I journey through two zones and into a third to get back to the cauldron (I've gone further to retrieve my body before) and I carefully search the landscape, avoiding the orcs, before I find my body wedged in the rocks behind the camp.  As I've seen many times, after one lags out the creatures eventually begin to ignore you.  I've seen people fighting, suddenly they just stand there, the opponent takes a few more swings then eventually turns around and wanders off or attacks someone else.
<br><br>
In my case I may have taken some hits form the Orcs, but most likely I just kept walking and before I was recognized as link-dead by the server I walked off a ledge and into a deep crevice.  It was easy to get my goods back, but being fairly high level, I lost a portion of the experience I had gathered.  In this case it was NOT enough to lose a level.  So I was still 15th level.
<br><br>
Death is not always so easy to get over.
<br><br>
Arch had died before this.  He was 16th level and managed to come across a group of opponents who handled him easily.  At that point he dropped to fifteenth level.  This is hazardous, and while I lost my goods and again had to retrieve them from my body, I had also lost use of about 4 spells I had purchased that were for 16th level wizards.  So while I still had the spells transcribed into my book, I had lost comprehension of how to cast them.  That's why we were in the cauldron, looking for opponents to bring back the lost portion of my experience that would bring me back to 16th.
<br><br>
I know of NO resurrection spell.  That's not to say that it isn't part of a quest or that it isn't just so high level I'll never see it, but I've heard no tales of such a spell to date.
<br><br>
Sony has shown no interest in changing the way folks die.  With the current system there is a fairly appropriate punishment for being reckless enough to die.  And it's typically not character ending.  I had one character I abandoned after losing all my goods way out in the Karanas somewhere, back when certain zones had framerate problems so bad I could barely move, while the monsters went to town on me.  All zones seem to run well now (depending on how many people are in the immediate area).
<br><br>
With my death in the cauldron I felt no need to contact a GM to see if I could get my stuff back.  It's vital that you try and recover your goods yourself rather than bugging a GM.  It's all part of the adventure.  In fact, I felt better about my unfortunate fit of lag after I had succeeded in retrieving the body myself.
<br><br>
There will never be permanent death in EQ.  There is not a high level character in the game who has not died at some point, even multiple times.  The world would have no true epic tales as nobody could get to the high level dungeons if they could not continue with their characters after a death.
<br><br>
Essentially, death is only a setback.  A setback of varying degree depending on the circumstances, but that's all part of the voyage.  When you play, you WILL die; It's unavoidable.  And believe me, when it has happened to you then you won't be thrilled to make the trek to get your things back, but it is a punishment that beats never being able to use your favorite character ever again.  And I think that Sony has backed the right horse in making sure you can continue the fun rather than having to introduce a new character to your adventuring group.
<br><br>
I'd hate to think that I couldn't use Archanalia any more because he lagged out.
