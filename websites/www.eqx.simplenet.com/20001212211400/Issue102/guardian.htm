"You must be swift, Gatherer.  We are not secure here.  Find your resources so we may come home again."
<br><br>
"You are a wise Guardian.  And we will obey your needs at the moment that we have recovered the resources that we require.  There is much need for the ancient things this season."
<br><br>
The five Gatherers moved with what appeared to the Guardian as purposeful sloth.  He was one of the swift, agile Guardians.  It was his duty to soak in the sunlight and use its heat to great affect, being furiously fast and terribly strong when an enemy appeared.  It was his duty to destroy the beasts that threatened his people.  The Gatherers were sluggish, storing the suns strength and using it sparingly, so that they could remain active for longer periods, often spending many hours of darkness under the stars by the fires trying to understand the resources that they unearthed during these scavenging trips.
<br><br>
And that frustrated the Guardian.  In many ways he would have preferred to have been born a Hunter.  Hunters were the ones that went out an chose their battles, stalking the enemy using the energy saving talents of the Gatherers, and then bursting into activity in order to kill the prey and bring it back so that their people could eat.  But many Hunters died when surprised by the great cats that often stalked them.  It took a Hunter several minutes to change from the slow stalker to the swift killer, and during that time, they were easy prey for the furry predators of the Field of Bones.  Only a Guardian remained swift at all times.  Only a Guardian could protect Gatherers.
<br><br>
And so the Guardian watched.  His tongue flicked from his mouth constantly, always alert for a scent that would betray a predator.  There were so few Guardians these days.  So many had been killed and so few born.  Many Guardians wondered if that might be the fault of the Healers.  There was an undercurrent of thought that held that they were asking their mother-god Veeshan for more Gatherers and Healers, and that god was doing something to make this happen.  If the Healers were not so important to the Guardians for their power to cure the damage of battle, the Guardians might have killed them all long ago.
<br><br>
"Hssssst!"  The Guardian grew angry at the thought.  His hiss was heard by the Gatherers, who froze in place fearing danger.  The Guardian hissed at them again, "Gather with swiftness!  This is an unsafe location."  The Gatherers went back to their plodding search for things of the ages past.  They prodded the ground with sharpened sticks or the teeth of large predators.  They turned over the bones of the massive dragon with an apparent reverence.  The lead Gatherer used a long and sharp pole made of tempered steel, one of the resources that he had uncovered many years ago.  It was his badge, and it was a far better tool for his work than any other.  Its weight and fine point made it easy to plunge into the ground.  The lead Gatherer often found greater resources than the others because of this.  And, therefore, his esteem among his people was always high.  Luck favored some, thought the Guardian.
<br><br>
As they worked the Gatherers talked, sounding almost excited, something that their metabolism made difficult for them.
<br><br>
"Something must have ended the existence of this ancestor.  There may exist some great war resource here."
<br><br>
"Yes, perhaps a magic cutting device, or some of the ancient protective armor."
<br><br>
"Or maybe one of the great stones…"
<br><br>
"Sssss…"  As one all of the Gatherers hissed, gently and reverently.  The Guardian had never seen one of the great stones, but he knew that they had power, magical power.  Rumors among the Healers said the end of the great empire had been brought about by Rallos Zek, and that in order to defeat the Iksar he had forced The Goddess of Love to wither the hearts of their Burners.  They claimed that the great stones were those very hearts, still holding the magics of their ancestors.  The Guardians did not believe this tale, for Rallos Zek needed no aid from the Goddess of Love to destroy any people.  The Guardians believed that it was the Burners that had turned away from the great War God, and his wrath alone shriveled their useless hearts.  It was also commonly known that the only great stone ever found was discovered by a Guardian, not a Gatherer.  Only the heart of a warrior, with hot blood running through it, was worthy enough to earn the gift that Rallos Zek had left for them.  Only by regaining the deadly desires, the boiling blood of their past, would they regain their empire.  Only Rallos Zek could give them the strength.
<br><br>
And now their ancient enemies had returned.  Those that the War God deemed worthier than the Iksar had again set foot on Kunark.  It was the final test.  The Iksar would either return to their worship of War, or they would all die.  And so the search for resources of the ancient empire became frantic.  So much so that the Gatherers were going out every day.  And with the reduced number of Guardians, there were many times like today when only one was available to protect each group.  And because of that, more Guardians were dying.
<br><br>
"Who fights the war?  Who destroys the enemy?  Who serves War?  Who IS the Empire?"  The old Guardian chant, with no one to return the final phrase: 'We do!  We are!'  The Gatherers stopped to stare at him.  Perhaps they thought that their Guardian was insane.  Let them think what they would.  They lived a long time, the Gatherers, but they lived it so slowly that they never really lived.  What seems like sanity to them would make them appear completely mad to a Guardian.
<br><br>
How could such a warrior be a servant to these sluggish, dimwitted Gatherers?  How is it that the Iksar could have fallen so far that our leaders are Healers?  Why is it that no Guardians have chosen to lead us to battle with the enemy?
<br><br>
The Guardian smelled something at the same moment that he heard it.  There was no need to turn and see what it was.  It was directly behind him.  He knew the rhino, or at least knew the type.  He was a very experienced Guardian.  He knew that the thing would not attack Gatherers, unless a Gatherer was foolish enough to interfere with it.  The rhino reacted to activity, as most of the large creatures on the Field did.  If the Gatherers simply continued about their tasks, the beast would wander off.  It was more of a challenge for the Guardian to remain still.  With all of his thoughts about the invaders and the Iksar falling out of favor with War, it was hard for him not to attack the beast.  He might be able to defeat it.  And succeed or fail, such an act was sure to please Rallos Zek.
<br><br>
It must, then, have been War that acted at that moment.  It could only have been Him that revealed the resource to the Gatherer.  Even fifty feet away with a large mammal breathing on the back of his legs, the Guardian could hear the sound of the Gatherer's metal pole beating against something metallic.  The sound caused the rhino to snort, a distinctly unpleasant feeling of warm air rushing across the Guardian's back as it raised its massive head.
<br><br>
He could have warned the Gatherers without disturbing the beast.  A single loud hiss might startle the beast, but it would not be likely to react as long as he remained still.  But he chose not to.  He defied his duty and remained silent.  At that moment he did not know why, though soon enough he would understand.
<br><br>
The Gatherers became excited at their discovery.  As excited as a Gatherer can get, anyway.  They moved with an uncharacteristic alacrity to gather around their leader and see what he had uncovered.  And, in doing so, they focused the attention of the rhino on a single spot.  It snorted again, but this time the Guardian felt nothing of its fetid breath, as the creature now stood beside him.  The beast scuffed at the ground with its hoof, and the Guardian could see the dust rise.  The rhino stepped past him and scuffed at the ground again.
<br><br>
At that moment the Guardian could have taken advantage of the beast and defeat it.  But again he remained still and denied what he had been taught to do since his youth.  He had been taught the way of the Guardian, while others, most others in fact, had been taught the ways of the Gatherer.  He still could not determine how the Healers could tell a young Gatherer from a young Hunter.  All of the children of the City seemed the same to him.  But the Healers could tell them apart, a gift from Veeshan.  And every year, fewer and fewer Guardians were born…
<br><br>
The Gatherers began to move about, tossing dragon bones about with none of the reverence that they  had shown earlier.  The rhino moved a few steps closer, and then began to charge.  The Gatherers looked up almost as if they were a single creature.  And they all froze in place.  One of them was gored and trampled to death right away.  Another had his leg crushed as the beast stomped on it.  His cries of anguish sent the other Gatherers running.  They moved as fast as they could, tumbling over the dragon's bones and scrabbling back to their feet.  They never looked back as they clawed their way over the short wall of stone that defined some ancient ruin.
<br><br>
The rhino sniffed at the fallen Gatherers and seemed satisfied.  It simply wandered away, with but a single glance back at the Guardian, who had remained unmoving through it all.  When the beast turned its gaze away and moved off to more fertile ground, the Guardian suddenly found himself moving, as if released from a spell.  He knew what he must do next.  If a single Gatherer returned to tell the Healers of his actions, or lack thereof, he would be exiled or perhaps killed.
<br><br>
The Guardian knew nothing of hunting, though, so he simply killed the wounded and now unconscious Gatherer and waited for the rest to cringe back.  They were easy prey for him when he finally released his pent up and overboiling blood.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
It was long before evening, and the Guardian was already beginning to slow down.  He knew that he would need to hide himself.  He was not ready to return to the city, even if he could have made the trip.  His energy reserves were gone, and his strength and speed nearly gone as well.  He would have to hide himself nearby.  While the daylight hours are dangerous on the Field of Bone, the hours of night are far more so.  And the Guardian knew that he would sleep very deeply this night.
<br><br>
The Guardian moved over to the box.  It took him a few furious moments to expose a handle and rip the box from the ground.  It was heavy and large, and by the time it came free of the ground the Guardian was completely spent.  The box was longer than he was tall, and twice the width of his shoulders.  It was made entirely of metal, pitted and rusted through in many places.  It had handles on all four sides, and was obviously meant to be carried by four people.  Four Gatherers, perhaps.  Or two Guardians.  He had little hope that anything useful would be inside.  But he needed to look, Rallos Zek meant him to find this box.  Its contents were for him, and he was certain that they would show him his path.  Whatever was in that box was his future.
<br><br>
He located the prodding pole, pulling it from the hands of its last owner with only a slight feeling of shame.  He used it to pry the box open.  It creaked with centuries of rust, but it opened.  He removed its contents slowly, partially from reverence, but mostly from a lack of heat in his blood.  He looked over each item and carefully placed each one in the hole that the box had once occupied.  Seven blades of different types, four metal shields, a small box with various rings and jewelry and two complete sets of metal armor, one made of small connecting rings and the other of jointed steel plates found their way back into the earth.  The Guardian had no doubt that each item, even the jewelry, was an item of War.  He knew that one day soon he would lead his people into battle against the enemy wielding one of those blades and wearing that plated armor.
<br><br>
But for now, he needed to survive the rest of the day and the night.  He lowered the box into the ground on top of the resources.  The box only fell halfway into the ground, but that would have to do.  He slowly crawled inside and used his weight to pull the lid closed on top of him.  The corpses of the Gatherers would certainly attract the nighttime scavengers.  And they would draw the predators.  But he knew that he would be safe, War wanted him.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
When the heat of the sun had warmed his hiding place, the Guardian awoke.  He had dreamed while he slept, something that he had never done.  Dreaming was for the Healers.  He remembered little of it, mostly scenes of battle.  Death ruled his dreams.  He saw the Iksar of old wearing the plated armor that he had uncovered and killing invaders.  Or were they the invaders, conquering?  They cut swaths in the enemy armies.  They were strong and skilled, and all hot with battle blood.  Blood was everywhere.
<br><br>
He pushed the lid open again, this time with ease as his strength had mostly returned.  An hour in the hot morning sun and he would be a Guardian again.
<br><br>
As he sat upon the long low wall that started nowhere and ended in the same place, his memory of the dreams faded.  But while all of the details left him, two concepts remained.  The first was that Gatherers were not truly Gatherers.  At least not during the days of the Empire.  In those days they were Porters, beasts of burden.  Able to carry loads for long periods of time, though not with any great speed.  Their elevation to Gatherer was a consequence of the fall of the Empire...  or perhaps it was partially the cause of the fall of the Empire...  The Guardian could remember a sense of betrayal during his dreams, and he was certain now that the Porters were the source.  He vowed that they would all pay for the loss of the Empire.
<br><br>
The second thing that he remembered was that each Iksar had a name, with the exception of the Porters who did not deserve one.  People were known by their deeds, and individuals were recognized not only by a title, but by the name that they had earned.  And so it would be again.  And it would start with him.
<br><br>
It only took a moment of thought to come up with his name.  He would be known as Guardian Blood, in honor of his god and of the dream that he sent.
<br><br>
Guardian Blood devoured the last of his food ravenously.  He buried the remnants of the Gatherers, an easy task considering that little of them remained.  He was only able to locate two of them, and there was very little left of them.  He then placed all of the resources back in their box and buried it as well.  He would have to find some people that he could trust before bringing them back to the city.  The Healers would simply claim the treasures and give them to the Gatherers to study.  Eventually he would be given some of it back, as reward for his discovery.  But the rest would be out of his control, and he needed those resources to seize control of the city, to lead his people to war and to rebuild the Empire.  He kept one ring, a silver ring with a blood red stone, and put it in his bag.  He would use it to prove to his allies that he was to lead them.  He also took with him the steel pole.  It would serve him well as a weapon, if the Healers let him keep it...
<br><br>
"Hssst!"
<br><br>
He would have to contain his anger if he were to remain undiscovered in his new treachery, his new role as conqueror.  He would have to be careful and avoid killing any other worthless Gatherers or Healers until his position was stronger.
<br><br>
As he was about to leave, the rhino returned.  He could see it in the distance.  It certainly may have been a different rhino, but he doubted it.  It just watched him as he walked away.  Another sign from War, he was certain.  It was as the sun reached its highest position in the sky that Blood left, and because nothing hindered him, he arrived at the city just as night fell.  He paused near the statues that marked the edge of the city.  A city that he would soon control.  The city of a people that were ready for a transformation.  People that were ready to rule the world again.  They would rebuild their city, perhaps in a new location.  Living in the ruins of the old Empire kept them safe, but it also made them weak.  They would build new towers, carve new statues.  And they would carve statues of Guardian Blood.  He would give them reason to.
