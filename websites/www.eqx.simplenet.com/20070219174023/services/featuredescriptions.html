					<div class="subtitles"><h2>Feature Descriptions</h2></div>

					<div class="border_box">
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="diskspace"></a>Disk Space MB</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">A web site consists of text, graphics, sound, or video files that occupy space on our web servers. You can purchase additional disk space as needed.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="monthlytransfer"></a>Monthly Transfer GB (Bandwidth)</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Whenever a person visits your site, information is sent from our servers (your web site) to your visitor's computer. This information can be web pages, images, movies, sound files, programs, compressed files, or anything else on your site that can be viewed or downloaded by visitors. The movement of this information in total is your data transfer. The more visitors you have, the higher data transfer limit you'll need. You can purchase additional transfer as needed.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="frontpage"></a>Microsoft FrontPage&reg; Extensions</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Microsoft FrontPage&reg;, is a software program for creating and managing web pages. You can work exclusively in the familiar Microsoft Office&reg; interface without having to program, or take direct control of your HTML code. FrontPage 2002 supports collaborative web authoring and more. Offered with all packages.</div>

						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="mivascripting"></a>MIVA Scripting</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">MIVA Script programs are HTML documents that also contain tags (commands) from the MIVA Script programming language. MIVA Script is a server-side scripting language that is processed at the server level rather than by the browser. MIVA Script programs can are called scripts, active documents, or simply documents. MIVA Script tags correspond to typical programming language constructs such as assignment statements, conditional expressions, loops, and input/output statements, as well as MIVA Script's special database, mail, and commerce functionality. SimpleNet supports both the uncompiled (.mv) and compiled (.mvc) versions of MIVA.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="mivamerchant"></a>MIVA Merchant 5.0 Shopping Cart</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">MIVA Merchant is a dynamic, browser-based storefront development and management system. It has a complete set of wizards to simplify the process of building your store, while the administration interface provides access to an array of tools to maintain your product catalog and order fulfillment. In order to offer MIVA Merchant with reseller packages, the reseller must create a partnership with MIVA.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="phpscripting"></a>PHP Scripting</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">PHP is a widely-used, general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. PHP allows you to do many of the same functions as C and PERL - connecting to a database, reading and writing files, etc. Using PHP scripting to read and write to your MySQL database gives you ultimate control of your site.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="cgiscripting"></a>CGI Scripting</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">The common gateway interface (CGI) is a standard way for a Web server to pass a Web user's request to an application program and to receive data back to forward to the user. When the user requests a Web page (for example, by clicking on a highlighted word or entering a Web site address), the server sends back the requested page. However, when a user fills out a form on a Web page and sends it in, it usually needs to be processed by an application program. The Web server typically passes the form information to a small application program that processes the data and may send back a confirmation message. This method or convention for passing data back and forth between the server and the application is called the common gateway interface (CGI).</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="serversideincludes"></a>Server Side Includes</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">SSI is a type of HTML comment that directs our web servers to dynamically generate data for your web page whenever it is requested. This is especially useful for ensuring that boilerplate components, such as headers and footers, are the same on all pages throughout your web site. To change a boilerplate element, you need only modify the include file, instead of updating every individual Web page.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="customerrorpages"></a>Custom Error Pages</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Create customized error pages on your web site to help visitors reach their intended destination. A "404 not found" page is displayed when a visitor tries to view a page that you've deleted or moved.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="password"></a>Password Protected Directories</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Password protection allows you to control who can view your site or various areas within it. For instance, if you create a special area for photos or other information, you can protect that area with a password and give that password only to those who are allowed access.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="emailaccount"></a>Email Account</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Email (electronic mail) is the exchange
						  of messages via the web. Email is one of the most basic
						  and popular uses of the Internet. SimpleNet email accounts
						  may be checked through the web or you may use an email
						  client such as Outlook or Eudora, to name a few. You can create multiple
						  email accounts for yourself, friends, family members and associates with
						  your own domain name, such as you@yourname.com, advertising@yourname.com,
						  and info@yourname.com. All email accounts include Aliases,
						  Forwards and Auto-responders (see below).</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="emailforward"></a>Email Forward</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Email forwarding enables you to have email messages redirected to a specific email account. For example, you can set up the email account sales@yourname.com to forward all messages to your account you@yourname.com or to another account not at yourname.com. These forwards can be added or deleted at any time.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="emailalias"></a>Email Alias</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Email Aliases allow you to create email addresses that act as pseudonyms for your actual email account. For example, you can have sales@yourname.com, marketing@yourname.com and billing@yourname.com all alias to you@yourname.com. These aliases can be added or deleted at any time.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="anyoneaddress"></a>Anyone@ "Catch-all" Address</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Allows you to collect mis-addressed messages (e.g., wrongname@youraccount.com) and have them delivered to a specific email account like you@youraccount.com.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="emailauto"></a>Email Auto-Responder</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">All your email accounts can be set to automatically respond to incoming messages. This is a good feature to use if you're on vacation, if you don't check your mail frequently, or if you would like to create an automated response to frequently asked questions, such as pricing or hours of operation.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="emailspam"></a>Email Spam Filter</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Allows you to trace, filter out and delete spam messages coming to your mailbox. The spam check level has five settings that you can alter, from very aggressive to permissive, based on how restrictive you prefer your incoming mail to be filtered. There is also a white list, which specifies email from acceptable email addresses, and a black list, which rejects email from specified addresses.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="mailboxdiskspace"></a>Mailbox Disk Space (per mailbox)</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">When you receive email, the messages occupy disk space on our servers. The more email you get, the more disk space you need. Each email account includes 50 MB of disk space. You can purchase additional email disk space as needed.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="oscommerce"></a>osCommerce</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">osCommerce is an online shop e-commerce solution under ongoing development by the open source community. Its feature-packed installation allows store owners to setup, run, and maintain their online stores with minimum effort and no license fees. osCommerce combines open source solutions to provide a free and open e-commerce platform, which includes the powerful PHP web scripting language and the fast MySQL database server. Offered with S-150, S-300 and Commerce packages.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="ssl"></a>Secure Server (SSL)</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">SSL is an accepted standard for transferring information securely across the Internet. It encrypts data passed between the server and the browser, so that unauthorized parties cannot interpret sensitive, confidential or personal information, such as a phone number, address or credit card. The type of SSL that you use depends on the secure address that you'd like your customers to see. With Shared SSL, your secure address will be, https://youraccount.ssl.yourname.com. Private SSL will change your secure address to, https://www.youraccount.com. The Secure Certificate is initially $189 and can be renewed each year for $149. To obtain a Secure Server Certificate for Private SSL, please contact <a href="../contact.html">customer support</a>.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="ipaddress"></a>Dedicated IP Address</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">A Dedicated IP Address is a number that is assigned to your web site account. With the growth of the Internet, it is no longer possible for every server and web site to have its own IP Address. To address this issue, many Internet Presence Providers assign IP Address pools to shared web servers so that they may deal with incoming and outgoing traffic for several web sites. A Dedicated IP Address is necessary for accounts that wish to use a  Private Secure Server (SSL).</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="domainname"></a>Domain Name</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Domain names are the means by which things are located on the web, much like your home address says where you live. Having an easy-to-remember domain name makes it much simpler for you to promote your site such that friends, family and associates remember its location.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="subdomains"></a>Subdomains</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">A subdomain, also known as a third level domain, is a great way to create memorable web addresses for various areas of your site. For instance, you can create photos.yourname.com and have that address redirect to the yourname.com/photos directory of your web site.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="thirdleveldomain"></a>Third Level Domain (yourname.simplenet.com)</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">A special type of web site that allows you to use our domain name "simplenet.com" instead of registering your own domain such as yourdomain.com</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="rawlogs"></a>Raw Logs</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Raw access logs record data about who visits your site. The logs include volumes of information that you can manage and analyze.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="referrerlogs"></a>Referrer Logs</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Referrer logs are an additional log component of that indicate what pages or web site a user was on before they came to a page on your site.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="errorlogs"></a>Error Logs</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Error logs are an additional log component that indicate page requests that resulted in an error such as 404 - File Not Found.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="webalizer"></a>Webalizer</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">Webalizer is a fast web server log file analysis program. It produces highly detailed, easily configurable usage reports in HTML format, for viewing with a standard web browser.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="mysqldatabase"></a>MySQL Database</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">MySQL is an open source relational database management system that uses Structured Query Language (SQL), which is the most popular language for adding, accessing, and processing data in a database. MySQL is noted mainly for its speed, reliability, and flexibility.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="mysqlusers"></a>MySQL Users</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">The number of individual users you can create that will have administrative access to your MySQL databases.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="mysqldiskspace"></a>MySQL Database Disk Space</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">When you populate your database, the information occupies disk space on our servers. The larger your database, the more disk space you need. You can purchase additional disk space as needed.</div>
	
						<div class="gray_stripe"><h3><a name="ftp"></a>Virtual FTP Server</h3></div>
						<div class="border_box_middle">FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is a convenient, easy way to send multiple or large files across the Internet. It is a very useful tool for building and editing your web site.</div>
