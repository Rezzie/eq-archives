To Whom It May Concern:
 <br><br>
I was very disappointed to see that there was no rumors sections in Issue 56.  This has quickly become my favorite part of EQX.  I do also enjoy the Traveller's Tales and the new Ohaobol's Trophy though.  But I hope to see another rumor's section in Issue 57.
 <br><br>
By the way, when will the next Round Robin and Mig Hammer mystery come out?  Or do you have any idea?
 <br><br>

<em>[Ed. Fit to Print failed to appear last issue due to... technical difficulties.  I lost our advert somewhere in the Internet.  I also must admit that the Travelers Tales and Ohaobol's Trophy are some of my favorites too.  This week's tale by Ozy might be his best yet.  Elaan will come up with more of Ohaobol's tale when he can find the time, you gotta remember that this is a hobby for us, and other things must come first.  And Elaan has a pretty tough work schedule.  Round Robin will be concluding some time in the near future, but our efforts have been turned to the new story "The Scales of Fate".  And Mig is something that Arc writes when the inspiration hits him.  Can't rush that...]</em>

One or two things...
<br><br>
It's 2 o'clock in the morning, my eyelids are so damn heavy that I can barely
keep my eyes
open with the help of a pair of matchsticks ,and I still can't get enough of
EQ stuff (that is
reading EQX and EQSS).  
<br><br>
It all began about 5 years ago, when a fourteen year old kid picked up the
first book of the
Fellowship of the Ring trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. This is when I started to
get into the
fantasy and sci-fi stuff. From then on most of the time of my somewhat
meaningless life I
spend fantasizing and dreaming up my adventures in imaginary worlds. And here
is where
EQ steps in.
<br><br>
EverQuest may be the answer to my dreams. Although I did not get the chance to
play any
of the betas (result of an inability to meet the requirements with my current
excuse for a
computer), I am impatiently awaiting the time I will set up my newly bought PC
equipment (which is probably 4 or 5 months into the future), install the
software and log
on into the world of EverQuest.
<br><br>
This letter may seem pretty pathetic (actually, I know it is) but I just had
to give my
inspiration a go. I've been devouring any  news about EQ for almost a month
now (three
weeks and 4 days to be accurate) and still can't get enough of it. I would
give worlds to
play the beta and see what's it like, to experience it. But I think I will
have to settle for the
screenshots and the info I can get from you guys, at least for those couple of
months that
is. I sure am trying to hook my friend up with an idea of him owning the
"ultimate
experience of fantasy" starting from March 16 since he has much more better
hardware
than myself.
<br><br>
Overall I wanted to congratulate you all on doing a great job of keeping goofs
like me
informed about this particular and wonderful event (sniff, sniff, I always got
all emotional
at the endings  : ). Thank you for reading this (a slim chance as it is...)
and for making all
this possible (sniff). I hope I will see you all in Norrath when my time
comes.
<br><br>
(furiously waving and sniffing)

<br><br>
P.S. Looking forward to all new tales of brave (and not so brave) adventures
to more detailed        information about the game itself.

<em>[Ed:  I just wanted to say, that I read every e-mail I get (except for the spam advertisements).  
I just can't answer all of them.  You know what, I always thought that folks that said that were just
lazy goofs, but it's true, I just don't have the time.  I can only imagine the terror 
that fills the mind of the guy at 989 that has to read all of our phase 4 e-mails when 
he hears the "bong"ing of his computer that tells him "You have mail"...]</em>
