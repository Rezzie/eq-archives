<b>EAST KARANA -</b>
<br><br>
In a move to boost sagging ticket sales, the league of Antonican bards will
be sending many bards out on tour together.  The hope is that there will be
strength in numbers, with a wider range of bards appealing to a wider
audience, and hopefully reflecting more money.
<br><br>
When asked about the flagging attendance numbers, Guild Spokesman Furlin
Etherode blamed the trend toward gladiatorial duels.  However, he also
stated his opinion that arena battles are a fad.  "We've all seen blood and
there's nothing creative there.  They'll get disenchanted and come back,"
Furlin claimed.
