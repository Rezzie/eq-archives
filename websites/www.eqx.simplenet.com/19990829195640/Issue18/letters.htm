Well I just finished reading the latest Issue of EQX and I might add 
it is the best issue yet.  The one story by Razor <a href="../Issue17/geek.htm">"The ultimate geeking 
experience"</a> certainly amused me as I sat here and though "LOSER" but 
then I realized that my experience was almost identical during the 
Realm 3.x beta.  I work night slight so I'd wake up at about 1pm and then 
get pissed off when the server was still down for updates uttering some 
comment about incompetent programmers then heading off to work.  While 
at work my mind would be solely concentrated on what new thing I would 
try out tonight and what changes they should make.

When I finally got 
home I'd turn on my P200mmx with 64 RAM loggin, then marvel at the 
brilliance of the programmers for the updates. Then I would play for 
hours always pushing my sleep back. Then I'd find some bug that would 
cause a wipe, cus and swear for a while about incompetent programmers 
and fall into a three hour coma dreaming about the next night of 
gaming.  This continues until two or three months after the release 
then I decide to lay-off Realm and console my wife for a while, little does 
she know I've found another pet called EverQuest and I've already got my 
storage of 100 2L bottles of Pepsi waiting for that magic e-mail.
