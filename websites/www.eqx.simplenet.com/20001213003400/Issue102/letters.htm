    Oghma is the god of Bards and the Celtic god of knowledge.  Why then do you play as a dwarf.  you should be a elven bard or a erudite according to the mental image i have.  ofcourse im not trying to tell you what to do.  But thats just how i see it.  and ive been using the name Oghma in RPG's for some time now.
<br><br><br>
<em>Hello.
<br><br>
I am very aware of that, it is why I chose the name :).  Early in the beta
for EverQuest, the race/class division was not set in stone, and I happened
to really like the image of a dwarf bard.  I, like you, have played an
Oghma in RPG's and Muds for a while (since 1988), and part of the idea of a
Dwarf Bard was that Oghma is also a mighty warrior and was well known for
his strength and prowess as wrestler.  As Dwarves are powerfully strong
warriors, I felt it appropriate.  Also, as Oghma is the creator of the
ogham script, I feel a strong part of the concept is to be a chronicler of
the Dwarven race.  This task was left to the bards and priests of the
Celtic peoples, so when dwarves were not allowed to be bards in the final
version of the EQ, I made my Oghma a cleric.
<br><br>
	We all have our own image of characters, and they are all equally valid if
the concept is consistent.  I myself prefer Amergin for an Elven bard (he
was of the Milesian wave of invaders to Ireland, who displaced the Tuatha
De Danaan of which Oghma was a member), and Oisin for a human bard(he was a
son of Finn MacCool, the Irish Cheiftain).  But that's just me, I'm a big
fan of mythology :).
<br><br>
Thanks for reading EQX, and for your letter!  We Oghmas must stick together!
<br><br>
PS. Aklar even wrote a story about a dwarf who wanted to be a bard, and
named him Ahgmo :).

I would first like to say that I just started reading your site when I saw a link on a web page that led to the article called "Can role-playing be defined?" by Russell Linton. That led me to other stories by following the link and I can only say Wow! I was very sad to have the "Birth of Evil" story end. What a fantastic plot. So, my first question is...Is he a "real" writer as in author of novels or such or are you just teasing us with one short story? And my second questions is about Warriors. Why is it that any other profession needs to rest for only a short time after a good fight, as for the magi type all is needed about 3 or 4 minutes of meditation and they are ready for battle, or the weaker fighters who can totally heal themselves in a minute and make up the mana in the next fight, But the true warriors, the masters of mayhem and might must sit on our behinds wiggling about for 20 minutes or more if we happen to be without healing support? Why aren't we able to be up and about in 3-4 minutes like everyone else? Please help! And take yer time in responding as I have much time between battles. Thank you!

<em>Azariah, its wonderful to hear that you enjoyed my story '<a href="../Issue41/birth.htm">The Birth of Evil'</a>.!  Your kind words (and those of the editor) could make a guy blush... in public... at work... and make people stare at them... I'm not a professional writer but I'm flattered that you found my work to be of that caliber!  I havent had the chance to contribute to EQX for some time, though Id like to be able to more often. Maybe I'll let your praise go to my head and write up a few more tales of Norrath for EQX.... However, Im sure youve noticed, EQX isnt lacking in talented artists, writers, and editors! 'The Birth of Evil' is just a brush stroke on the Mona Lisa of EQX fanzines : )

I love your art work!!!  Its Great.   You do great work.  I love the way
you draw the Troll and the Dark Elves.  Especially Innoruuk's daughter.
Any chance of you drawing a pic of her in like chainmail anytime soon?
That should really drive the love crazed bard nuts! hehehe  .... Or  perhaps
just a special pic signed and emailed... that would be AWSOME!

Well anyways,  Keep up the good work!!!

Absor et al,

Just wanted to congratulate all the EQ staffers on issue 100 and the upcoming anniversary. Just when I get depressed at the loss of Aklar, you bring on two new great talents (Onnie, and Sir Maximus) to make the next 100 issues look as promising as the first. I've been reading for a long while now, and look forward to each new issue to lighten up my week.
<br><br>
On a different note: I was bored at work the other night and came up with a goofy "wheaties" spoof to send to my brother across country. He suggested it would be a good filler for a "fit to print" sponsor if you ever got strapped for ideas. Dunno about that, I think he just wants to see Famien (his half-elven ranger) on EQX. In any case, it's yours if you can do something with it, I just threw it up on my currently non-existent geocities account:

I remember a article a couple of issues back about other RPGs out there
right now. Well, I found one that wasn't mentioned: 
http://www.worldforge.org/  its in Alpha Testing but is available to
play right now as it is a open source development on Windows, NT, and
various Inxs.

Solusek belongs on the neutral list. There is nothing, not one thing in
the description that makes it evil. Oh, and it's not 5 magicians. It's
ALL the wizards too.
<br><br>
Good thing there aren't any high elf wizards around, eh? 
<br><br>

Sergey
<br><br><br>
<em>Well, you could be right.  The whole placement of gods is very much based on a personal interpretation of them based on the very scant information we have been given.  I read the description and got the impression of a god of destruction.

<br><br>
The Followers of Solusek Ro belive in the raw and unbridled power of fire. Fire birthed the world and in fire shall it be consumed. True aggressive action is the only way for one to obtain what is desired. Power is gained by superior force. Followers of Ro have little fear. They are bold and brash, and say what they mean, and do what they say. Social graces are something they neither possess nor desire. They demand the respect of their peers and more often than not, earn it as well. Those who seek true elemental power follow Solusek Ro, and thus many wizards turn to his burning embrace. 
 <br><br>

<br><br>
The bit about 'aggressive action is the only way for one to obtain what is desired." and "Power is gained by superior force." sound to me like 'might makes right', and that sound evil.  However, Solusek could be moved to the neutrals with little effect on the teams, considering that there are so few worshippers.
<br><br>
I haven't a clue what you mean about "not 5 magicians..." though.
<br><br>
Thanks for the comments.  I wasn't sure that anyone would want to spend their time reading such a long article.

  Well, basically, the great majority of High Elf wizards are followers of
Solusek Ro. And we both know there are plenty of high elf wizards. That
could make life tough on them. Not that I'd complain, but others might.
Mostly I've always thought that as a follower of Solusek Ro I am True
Neutral, much like Veeshan or Karana. We believe in force, but we have
no agenda like Innoruk or Cazic Thule. Or like Tunare for that matter.
<br><br>

Actually, I found your history quite fascinating. If only Verant had
invested half the time and thought you have we might have some RP out
there...

Now that I see the rest of the list, I think Rallos Zek, Veeshan, Solusek Ro, 
and Bristlebane could be a seperate "apathetic" team, with the neutrals 
already rather strong due to the huge number of agnostics.
<br><br><br>
<em>There are a lot of ways to set that up.  You're certainly right about Solusek, he could easily be on another team.  When I read his bio, I got a sense that he was a destructive force, and that his basic teaching was that might makes right.  The real problem here is that the only thing that we really know about him is a one paragraph bio on the web site, and maybe (though I've not seen any) a little bit of in game information.
<br><br>
For me, any organization of the gods that makes sense (like yours) and makes for relatively even teams is just fine, as long as they set up a background to tell us why the gods are aligned that way.
<br><br>
Thanks for the comments.  I've already received another letter telling me that Solusek should be a neutral...  I'm just shocked that anyone read that whole thing.  :)
