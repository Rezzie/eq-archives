Being a Necromancer had it disadvantages. Firstly the stigma attached to it provoked a hostile response in nearly everyone Alhazred met. Even his fellow Dark Elves were unsure at first. It was only when they listened to his greeting, the sonorous sound of his voice, that they recognised the true spirit within him. Where there once was a cold hate, now there was warmth and compassion. Something had changed Alhazred. Something had altered the whole course of his life. That something was not fate or circumstances or even the will of a god. It had flesh, blood, life and a name.  Rafiki.
<br><br>
After his engagement to that noble dark elf shadow knight, the world of Norrath had seemingly become a better if not more confusing place. The credo of Innoruuk seemed to sit uneasily with his new work for the Full Circle guild. Here he was, expected to give aid to those who, under normal circumstances, would be expected to kill him. There was a definite blurring of races and ideas these days and Alhazred was unsure how it would all pan out in the end.
<br><br>
Rafiki had also gone away. She was more at ease with the Full Circle guild's work. She had rushed off on an errand without saying goodbye. It must have been urgent mused Alhazred. To urgent even for a kiss.
<br><br>
Alhazred's evenings usually started the same way. He would buy food and water from the foreign quarter of Neriak and then head out into the Nektulos forest. He would then slowly make his way down to the strange ruin that lay close to the path, which led to the East Commons. The ruin was an enigma. Was it a construction by a powerful wizard or a gift from Innoruuk himself? It exhibited strange properties and seemed to be a gateway to the world of the undead for most of those creatures seemed to appear here. This made it a dangerous place to stay for too long but to those like he who needed the dust of the grave to work his magic, it was a useful spot to visit.
<br><br>
Tonight it was reasonably quiet. Alhazred had saved a few of his brethren who had been beset by too many creatures, but not much else had happened. He thought that he might venture out onto the East Commons later, although it was very bright there and he found that wore him down both mentally and physically. The good think about these dark woods he thought, is that you don't see many other races in here. 
<br><br>
For this reason, the sight of a short stocky figure staggering through the woods towards him came as something of a shock.
<br><br>
"Alhazred", comes a shout from the diminutive man.  "My lord, I have a letter for you.  I have travelled great distances from the north, an area barren and frozen.  There I met a lady, a lady who begged me to deliver a message unto you.  I was going to say no, but at the prize of five platinum, how could I resist?"
<br><br>
Alhazred considered the figure before him. No threat, he thought to himself, and worth a listen if he has news of Rafiki.
<br><br>
"I have had a long road 'My lord', she told me to address you as such, I hope it befits your station." For the fist time Lockless looked at Alhazred, judging his worth.  Was he truly befitting of the title "lord" thought Lockless? He shrugged his shoulders with the thought, Kings have played lower roles than this to escape the pressures or life, or so he had heard it told.  He produced a rolled up piece of parchment sealed only with a lock of hair tied to keep it shut and then passed it to Alhazred.  He then reached into the inside pocket of his cloak and produced a leather pouch.  He shook it gently, testing its weight, and Alhazred heard the jangling of coins. Lockless glanced at Alhazred, then to the leather pouch.  He then tossed the pouch to Alhazred.
<br><br>
 "Have the truth be known I should have never taken this in the first place. The full amount is there, I spent not a copper. I would have died if it were not for lady Rafiki, and that coin has been more curse than pleasure in remembering what she did for me."  He glanced at Alhazred, " I can see the eagerness, the longing in your eyes to know the story of what has happened here.  If you have the time for some conversation and a place to get me some decent food and drink I shall tell you, but if you are too busy I can be on my way, 'tis truly up to you, my lord."
<br><br>
Alhazred motioned for Lockless to stop. He couldn't focus on anything but the lock of hair that was wrapped around the scroll. It was Rafiki's hair, of that he was sure. He felt it with his fingers. Yes, he had stroked these beautiful strands before. As he brooded, there was a rumble of an oncoming storm.
<br><br>
"I will take you to Neriak" said Alhazred, as the first drops of rain struck his night dark skin. Lockless began to ready himself. Alhazred unrolled the scroll and began to read.
<br><br>
"Hello my love, I pray this finds you well and in good spirit.  I have had to go away to the north for the sake of duty these last weeks, the timing to leave was short, and I did not have time to say good bye to you.  Please know that you are in my heart and dreams and I will be returning to you soon.  I cannot wait to hold you again, to feel you close to me, to feel safe.  Look for me, if my calculations are correct, the day after you receive the letter. 
<br><br>
Eternally,<br>
Rafiki<br>
Officer of the Full Circle<br>
Shadow Knight<br>
Soul mate of Alhazred"
<br><br>
Alhazred rolled up the scroll and placed it safely inside his robe. He turned slowly in the direction of Neriak and strode off into the storm. He didn't look back once to see if Lockless was following him. All he wanted was Rafiki.
<br><br>
Later, they were in the basement of the Maiden's Fancy tavern. Alhzared's fellow dark elves shot threatening glances at his bedraggled companion as he tucked into the hearty meal Alhazred had ordered for him. Lockless pulled the plate of fresh rabbit closer and dug in.
 <br><br>
"Tis the first cooked meal I have ate in three days," Lockless said as he took another large bit of potato, managing to put the whole thing in his mouth before chewing.  He then reached for a roll of cracked wheat sitting next to him, tore off a piece and dunked the bread into the soup in which the rabbit had been cooked whilst at the same time draining his tankard of ale and raising it to the bar maid. "Might as well keep them coming my pretty lady, I plan on getting pissed drunk this night.  And I may perhaps look for some companionship later, look for me after my lord here leaves."  He noticed Alharzed's obvious discomfort of the use of the title "My lord" Lockless said whilst leaning close, the smell of alcohol already heavy on his breath.  "I be sorry mee uhhmm," in even a lower voice he finishes, "My lord, but I do not know how to address you otherwise, and the lady was quite adamant about me showing my manners in all of this.  Perhaps I should just give my tale and let you be on your way, by your actions I can tell you not be liking this tight confining area and all the other people milling about."  Lockless glanced at the predominately dark elf establishment of the tavern, "and the truth be known I think the sooner that neriak be behind me the better.  I do not see many of my kind here."  The halfling then looked back to alharzed..."Oh yes, the story."  Hhrrmm… Lockless cleared his throat.
<br><br>
"It 'twas four days ago, I found myself on a the trail of what had started as a rumour and ended up dragging me all over this blasted world in search of a treasure that does not exist.  Well the truth be known, I am a trap removal specialist by trade.  Perhaps you have heard of the master Roger Lockless, no lock was made that I can not open.  My father had been a tinkerer of sorts and always left parts of his contraptions laying about, so I always had an..." Lockless glanced up to take a bite and to see if Alhazred was being pulled into the story, looking for the gleam in his eye that would tell Lockless that he was enjoying what he was hearing.  Instead he saw coldness and agitation.
<br><br>
"Oh where is my head, tis probably from the lack of sleep my..." Lockless whispered, "lord.  You wish to hear of the lady and not the tirade of a halflings life, no matter that it has been said, by some, to be one of the best stories ever told."  "My lady", Lockless pushed the plate from him and gestured toward it as he stuffs the last bit of bread in to his mouth.  "Please phring phore."  Lockless chewed a few times as the barmaid stared down at him like he were a leprous old man for whom she had no use.  Lockless took a big swig of ale to help wash down his food and when he was  sure he could speak correctly, he sheepishly looked at her and pleaded, "Please bring more my lady, I find it quite pleasant to the pallet."
<br><br>
 Lockless took another drink from the tankard, and as he lowered it he looks at the fury that was beginning to form in alhazred's eyes.  Lockless looked around slowly, perhaps expecting a knife to his back. He decided to continue quickly.
<br><br>
 "The story comes in full now my lord, no more of myself except where it is pertinent to the tale."  Lockless watched as Alhazred visibly put himself back into control, settling the rage that was building.  "As I said it was 4 days ago, I found myself in the tundra area just south of the Barbarian home of Halas.  Being of the," Lockless glanced around and lowered his voice,"sneaky sort." He returned to a normal tone so as Alhazred would not have to strain to hear. " I was in an area though full of dangerous creatures, were of no real threat to someone of my abilities, and I was close, very close to the end of me journey.  The map I had paid a good price for in Free Port showed that there was a hidden cave in the south end of that region and inside was said to be a kings ransom."  Realising what he had just said aloud, Lockless glanced about nervously to see if someone might of heard, satisfied that no one had butted into their conversation he continued with the tale.
<br><br>
"And the cave does exist, but the map had not made mention of the guardians of its entrance.  Upon discovering the entrance I quickly went inside not wanting to draw attention to the location, and just past the entry zone I found why no one had claimed what was here.  As I marvelled at the piles of gold , jewels , armour and weapons of more like 10 kings ransoms, laying about I did not notice that, what I had taken to be a statue was actually a frost giant, and not just one but three.  I was taken unaware with a hit so forceful to me back that it sent me flying across the room to land dazed into a pile of coin. I felt my life almost fade from that one blow, and if it were not for me quick feet I surely would have died there.  I managed to weave amongst their legs to avoid those nasty clubs, and had just enough resolve and energy to reach the entrance, which was too small for them to leave through. 
<br><br>
 As I landed in the snow I felt the biting of sharp rock pebbles hitting me legs and back as the sound, of that similar to thunder, resounded from the cave entrance, I believe one of them beast got so aggravated that they threw there club at me. I laid there, trying to gain my breath and gather my wits, when I heard a low rumble and felt the ground begin to shake,as it began to toss me about like some doll.  As I rolled over onto me back to try to gain me footing, I saw the white cloud of death descending upon me.  The avalanche would be atop me in seconds.  Being of quick wit as well as quick feet I quickly turned about and laid flat as a board.  I felt the first wave of snow catch me on the back of my head, and it pushed me a good ten feet and then it came on like an ocean wave.  It picked me up and carried me with it down the rest of the mountain and spilled out into the tundra.  I lay there for several minutes after the ordeal, gathering my wits and realising it would truly be a long time before any went to the cave of kings.
<br><br>
It was then that I heard the high pitched cry of the cat.  It was close and would be on me in seconds, I was in no condition to fight, for have it be know that I broke my arm.  I rolled onto my side and grabbed me short sword with me good hand.  The beast sank its teeth in to me before I even had chance to clear scabbard.  I was going to die and I knew it, it was then that I saw the skeleton and heard the harsh battle cry of a women in a tongue I did not know."  Lockless shakes his head with remembrance. "I will draw the beast to me my friend," she said with out even a glance to who I was or to my race. "You must back away and hide until you are well.  I will watch over you until you are more rested.  Now get out of the cats reach." Lockless lowers his head," and then that's when the next cat came at me from the back.  As I was backing away to leave her there I was attacked by another.  I surely thought my life forfeit.  Yet this woman only laughed and said," you must smell of fish." Disregarding the great cat that was attacking her flank, she looked at the cat that now sat face to face with me and uttered something in a guttural language. The cat to my front cried out in such a manner as you would have thought a thousand deaths had just befallen it, and, as I believe she intended, the cat jumped over me and went right into the fray with her.  Again she said, "Go hide and rest, my small friend, I shall keep the beasts to me to aid your escape."  
<br><br>
This was the part that perplexed me, she had said, "small friend" so she had obviously seen me.  Yet she still was helping.  "You must go quickly, I can not keep them away from you for long.", she said as she went into another incantation, and the first cat that had attacked became encircled and cried out in pain as a noxious green cloud descended upon it.  And in my ignorance all I could think to say was…"
<br><br>
 Lockless looked around and then lowered his voice and moved close to Alhazred, "good I hope you die you dark elf whore."  With that Lockless lowered his head then shook it, as if fighting an inner demon, trying to come to grips with what had transpired.  "And then I ran away to leave her there to die." 
<br><br>
 Lockless looked up in shock and terror as he heard the incantations start to escape from Alhazred's lips.  "Hold your spell my lord," Lockless screamed, "My tale is almost done, and if in the end you decide my fate should be to die.  Then I will let you kill me.  Please My lord stay your hand, I beg of you to let me finish the tale."
<br><br>
Alhazred let his spell fade. He glared evilly at Lockless. "The next spell I cast" he snarled " Will be allowed to run it's course! Choose your next words wisely." Lockless wiped the sweat from his head.
<br><br>
 "You have chosen wisely my lord,"  he said. "Yes I left her there to die.  I even snickered to myself on the way back to town as I thought how clever I was, I was almost out of ear shot, and then that's when I heard the cry, not of pain, but of need, of great need, as if release of this one word had leant her the power to continue, it was feeding her, it was urging her to continue.  I turned and started to move back in the direction I had just come from.  I moved to a vantage point to where I could over look what was transpiring but not close enough to be caught when the great cats had finished her."  Lockless eyes were becoming misty. " Again I heard her cry out this word of need, again it was in a language I didn't understand.  She was begging to it, asking for help as she fought, asking for it to lend her strength.  One of the great cats went down, she was badly cut and wounded by this time.  Barely able to stand, yet she fought.  She looked up and saw me then and started to cry as she swung at the beast.  "I said get yourself to safety little one."  How could I respond to this, she was obviously going to die, she was going to die because she had helped me, and in return I had spit on her, called her names and left her for food.  Thinking she deserved it,"  Lockless stood up and pointed a finger at Alhazred, "NO I KNOW she deserved it.  Your kind had certainly not shown my family mercy when they came through and slaughtered my mother, my father, and my two brothers.  And leaving me only with scars," 
<br><br>
Lockless raised his shirt to show 2 jagged scars running horizontally across his abdomen." And not one came back."
<br><br>
 Lockless was shaking with rage, anger and confusion. Alhazred recognised this torment, it mirrored his of many years ago. 
<br><br>
"Not one," said Lockless as he lowered his head to the table and began to sob.  "I could not begin to believe what she was doing.  It was as if I were in a dream.  My mind could not grasp her humanity."  Again Lockless shook his head.  "That was when it happened again. The cry of need I mean.  She took a savage bite to the shoulder, and fell down to her knees, she was weeping, she looked at me...no no.. that is not right.  She looked through me and again she cried out.  She lifted her head back and threw one fist to the air, the other she outstretched out toward the great cat and with a last try at life called the word again.  And it was answered.  The very ground shook with power.  The cat was ignited in flame, and its cry made the others pain seem nothing.  If the other had died a thousand deaths then this great cat had 100 fold as many.  And then she collapsed unconscious."  Lockless shook his head again and muttered," Still after all that I almost left her there.  I am sorry but, you can not understand how the injuries caused to the soul, even at such an early age, can stay with you, it does stay with you forever.  If I could go back and change my actions with what happened with Rafiki I would, but alas I can not.  This lady friend of yours left me dumb founded and confused.  
<br><br>
I stood over her for many minutes, until she started to show some signs of life. I could do nothing else but shake my head at what she had done and ask,"Why?".  She shook her head and smiled a warm smile and said," Because you are my friend."  
<br><br>
At this point I believed her mad, and just started to walk away.  "The town is this way.  Come, more beasts will be out this night." I told her, "Then more people will need a friend this night.  Thank you but I must stay,  I am not welcome in Halas besides.  They see only a dark elf and not Rafiki.  Much as you do."  And then she tried to sit up despite her wounds.  I was dumbfounded, I did not know whether to laugh or cry.  "Then stay if you wish, the cats will have you by morning." 
<br><br>
And I started to turn and leave.  "Where are you heading?" She called after me.  "I am going to Freeport to see a man about a map." I told her, for I was very interested in leaving that frigid place.  "Will you deliver a message for me?" she asked.  
<br><br>
"You are crazy and beyond help." I called back. Her next words stopped me.  "I will pay five platinum. For you to deliver a message for me."  Being in the trade of procuring items for resell, I very rarely pass up a bargain.  
<br><br>
"To where?" I asked.  
<br><br>
"A place very near Freeport it is actually on the way.  The forests outside Neriak." She said.. I thought it over and it truly was on the way and did not appear to be much trouble. 
<br><br>
I looked at her and said,"For five platinum and the understanding of the word you cried out which delivered that touch of death upon the cat."  I was hoping to fall upon a magical item of some sort. 
<br><br>
At this she giggled.  "I could tell you the word but it would do you no good.  It tis my power and very personal to me, it tis the reason for which I live and breath, it is the answer of my dreams and desires.  It is all to me, it completes me.  That is all I can tell you," she replied.  
<br><br>
I thought the deal over in my head again, I weighed the odds.  It seemed to be an easy decision on my part.  "Yes, I will deliver your message, what is it?"  I asked bluntly.  She laughed at my fast pace and to-the-point attitude.  
<br><br>
"Please wait while I scribe two short letters.  One for you with directions for when you reach the forest, and the other to be delivered.."  She accompanied me then to the outskirts of Halas, where it was as she has said and she was not allowed inside the city.  How alone she must have felt!!  She quickly scribed one letter, and handed it to me ,"the directions." She said.  She wrote the other almost as quickly.and then cut a length of her hair and tied it around the parchment.  "To be delivered…" .that was the last thing we said in peace. 
<br><br>
 We were set upon by a hunting band of goblins.  Though she was not fully healed she waded in.  We were definitely out numbered.  I fought hard, she fought harder, but alas again it looked beyond our power.  It was then after I had killed the one and she still had three on her.  That she growled, " the money lays on the ground take it and go.  I will stay these three long enough for you to escape.  If you are truly a man of honour my little friend hold to your bargain."  And with that she started leading them away from me.  I started to move to fight again as I could see new wounds appearing on her and the old wounds reopening.  "GO" she yelled.  The situation was truly hopeless.  "Go!!" she screamed at me.  I turned and started running as fast as I could. 
<br><br>
 As I turned to go, I heard her whisper,"By the light let him find him, and let him understand."  I assume she was talking about you.  I was no more than twenty yards when I heard the first goblin go down, and then came the cry," her word of life, power and dreams" she had called it.  And up to today I never thought I would know what that word meant.  Now I do, she is truly a unique person, hold tight to her Alhazred." With that Lockless stood and stretched his legs.
<br><br>
 "Tis time to finish my journey to Freeport," he said and started to head towards the door.  Halfway there he stopped and turned back to Alhazred. " I have a secret to tell you, her word, the one she clings to like it were life., it tis the very word that was the name of the person I was to find.  It is your name. You must mean a lot to her."  Lockless shook his head again and looked back to Alhazred, he moved to the table and extended his arm. "My name is Roger Lockless of Rivervale, I am happy to meet you friend."
<br><br>
Alhazred looked long and hard at Lockless. Just as the small man's gesture began to falter and his hand trembled uncertainly, Alhazred took it firmly with his own. " I should kill you for leaving Rafiki to die. However I know that she is still alive. I know it here!" Alhazred thumped his chest. "As long as there is warmth here in my heart she still breathes. Rejoice in that, little man, as this is what keeps you alive."
<br><br>
They both stepped out into the storm. To Lockless' amazement, Alhazred walked alongside him.
<br><br>
"Where will you go Alhazred?" asked Lockless.
<br><br>
"Where I must go" Alhazred replied sternly. " To Rafiki."
<br><br>
"In this storm? Tis a inhospitable night!"
<br><br>
"I wouldn't have it any other way." Said Alhazred and in a flash of lightning Lockless saw a smile play on up the lips of the dark elf. Then, as it went dark again, Alhazred slipped away into the night.
<br><br>
