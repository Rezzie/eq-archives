<p style="text-align: justify">


Hey, Come buy me an ale<br>
and then hark to my tale<br>
of a minstrel so sweet and sassy.<br>
It's a hey nonny no<br>
And a la-did-dly-doe,<br>
She's me favorite bare a**ed lassy.
<br><br>
Now you might start to ask<br>
About what came to pass,<br>
(Aye, 'tis a tale way deep and shady)<br>
As this bard quick and bright<br>
Wanders in from the night<br>
To sing a song  of a bare a**ed lady.
<br><br>
"T'was the wizard!"  she said<br>
Who cast spells on her bed<br>
And majicked her wardrobe so cheery.<br>
"Now must all that she's worn<br>
Be away come the morn,"<br>
He intoned for a bare a**ed dearie
<br><br>
The bard woke astounded<br>
Her wardrobe impounded <br>
Yet she grinned at a spell so silly<br>
Where a wizard incanted,<br>
waved his arms, then chanted<br>
To assure him a bare a**ed filly
<br><br>
To the wizard's surprise<br>
The bard stood, rolled her eyes<br>
And grabbed her lyre and its cover<br>
She pulled down a silk drape<br>
As she planned her escape<br>
Sneering  "You'd make me a bare a**ed lover?"
<br><br>
With the curtain wrapped 'round<br>
She then stared the mage down<br>
Singing jests of his spells so weeny.<br>
She giggled making note<br>
Of a silly old goat<br>
 Who would have her a bare a**ed genie.
<br><br>
The wiz blushed he'd done wrong<br>
And then proposed this song<br>
Claiming, "This tune'll make you some money.<br>
So scribe this seduction<br>
Of clothing reduction<br>
And the bard made a bare a**ed honey."
<br><br>
Now, if the mage speaks true<br>
Then you'll pay me what's due<br>
As I trill this hey nonny viva.<br>
So, let's hear your gold clink<br>
As I finish my drink<br>
And this tale of the bare a**ed diva.
