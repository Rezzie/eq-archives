Last week I asked people to tell me about upcoming games not based on a fantasy setting.  Thanks to the folks that responded.  Thanks much!  The most commonly mentioned game was <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com">Anarchy Online</a>.  They've got some interesting concepts.  Player killing - safe cities and dangerous outlands.  Death - pay for insurance and be ressed from a bio scan, like a save feature.  Sides - good and bad, distinct lines between the two.  And they plan to make it so that quests are a one-time, one person or group thing.  So that if you have the quest key for a certain quest you will be the only one trying to complete that quest (unless it's a purposefully competitive quest).  This feature is one that I think is great, and perhaps a bit too ambitious.  We'll see.  They also plan a four year story line, not unlike Babylon Five.  This could be a great thing, but it could also be a disaster.  A plot would be great, but it could be far too restrictive (less so, for sure, then no plot at all...)  Seems like an interesting game.  The setting is the future, and the game seems high tech.  But the game will be set on a single planet.  And therefore the setting of the universe isn't going to take part in the setting for the game.  The game seems like it will be more like a cyber-punk setting.  The Evil is the corporation, and the good are the clans.  Beta is due early next year.  It should prove interesting.
<br><br>
Someone, with a snide comment about doing my own research, suggested <a href="http://www.mankind.net">Mankind</a>.  A quick bit of research shows me that this is a strategy game, not a role-playing game.  But I'm downloading it now to give it a shot.
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.atriarch.com">Atriarch</a>, on the other hand, seems very interesting.  A complete world, with five new alien races to play (<b>Thank you</b> for <b>not</b> adding in Humans!).  They also seem to have some good ideas about handling death.  If you die, you're dead.  Your character can reproduce, though.  If he/she does, then upon death you get to play the child, still in possession of all of his parent's stuff.  They plan to make it so that death will not hit you unaware, and that dying will be a risk that you take on purpose, not because you got jumped.  Though they have taken an interesting tact, it appears that your characters will continue to exist in the world even when you are off-line...  These folks seem to have a solid grasp on what they can and can't achieve in their game.  I think this one might be the one to watch.  They've tailored their back story and the world nicely, so that they won't have to explain away things that they can't implement.  For example, there is no space flight on this world.  Keep your eyes on these folks, let's see if they can produce what they promise.  (And if I played on Povar, I might try to bribe my way into the beta...)
<br><br>
Another suggestion was <a href="http://www.digitalanvil.com/home.html">Freelancer</a>, from Digital Anvil.  I had some trouble finding out what the game was about with a short review of their site, but my best guess is that it's going to be very much like Star Saga.  The idea seems to be to travel the star lanes trading goods or hunting down pirates.  But I wasn't able to discover anything more about it without working at it, and I'm not ready to do that.  This thing did win a lot of best of show awards at E3, though.
<br><br>
And I can't believe that I failed to mention <a href="http://www4.activision.com/games/vampire">Vampire</a>!  What a putz.  More like Neverwinter Nights than EQ.  It's not going to be massively multiplayer, but multiplayer nonetheless.  Check it out.
<br><br>
So, of these, I think Atriarch sounds the most interesting to me.  But, luckily, we all want something different from a game like this, check them all out.
<br><br>
I also heard from a few people that are just starting out.  A few independent folks that seem to have a solid grasp on the same things that I cling to so dearly.  I'm not going to mention them, since they aren't ready to be mentioned.  But I wish them the best of luck, and I ask them to keep me informed.  I'll pass any information I get directly to you folks as soon as I get it.
<br><br>
Still, not one superhero game...  Maybe I should contact Hero Games and see what their plans are...
<br><br>
Well, my stocks are staggering, my sofa is falling apart, and I lost in Vegas (well, unless some football bets come through this weekend).  So far my vacation isn't amounting to much.  But then I have managed to get my enchanter to 10th level, and I've been able to finish Ender's Shadow.  If, by some strange genetic failure that we'll blame on your parents, you've not read Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, do so.  And then read Ender's Shadow.  Ender's Game is a fantastic book.  Ender's Shadow is the same book written from the point of view of a different character.  At first I was skeptical.  I've read far too many Piers Anthony sequels to have any faith left in authors that seem to be milking their successful work for a few more dollars.  Ender's Shadow seemed that way at first.  But if you're at all a fan of Card, or a fan of fiction at all, you'll like this book.  Read it.
<br><br>
I suppose that you've guessed that I haven't all that much to write about this week.  You're partially correct.  I just have a few ramblings about EQ to add.  First off, I haven't tried it, but I read the patch message on the test server about moving the spells around in your spell book.  WooHOOO!  Thanks guys, we've needed this one for a while.
<br><br>
You know what, I wrote a long and somewhat ranting commentary about the recent banning hooha going on. I just deleted it. I think by this time in the week we're all tired of hearing about it. Let me just say that if we are only getting our information from the players that were banned about these things, then we aren't hearing the whole tale. Verant should not announce bans in game, the audience is sparse (1,500 of the, what... over 100.000 paying customers). They should post them on the official web site, clearly stating all warnings and the reasons behind them, and the reason for the ban.
<br><br>
Enough already from me. I have to go back to trying to figure out why I can't download the patch and therefor can't play…
