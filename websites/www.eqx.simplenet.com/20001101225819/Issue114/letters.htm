I just thought I'd let you know that there's another game that's similar to that, but due out much sooner.
 <br><br>
You may or may not have heard of the game Vampire: The Masquerade. It's a pencil & paper game that's grown fairly popular. Recently, a company called Nihilistic Software decided to convert that game onto the computer.
 <br><br>
It has an off-line single player game, as well as a multiplayer mode. I believe they allow up to eight players, not counting the StoryTeller (GM). As the StoryTeller, you can completely design levels for players to play in, and put in switches and triggers that the players can set off. You can set up NPCs to automaticaly respond to a PC's questions, or you can even take over that NPC and answer them yourself. For a really good time, you can insert an NPC and attack the players.
 <br><br>
Since it's based on a popular Pencil & Paper game, I'm assuming it'll be an immediate hit to anyone that buys it. Unfortunately, due to the company's lack of fame and money, it hasn't had much of an advertisement. Even I, an avid V:TM player, only recently heard of it.
 <br><br>
Oh... it's coming out sometime this March, too.
 <br><br>
For good information about the game, try http://www.planetvampire.com. They have a bunch of interviews with the creators, and little infobits and downloads to check out. There's also a great sneak-peek video to download. Unfortunately, it's rather large, and the narrorator is speaking in german. =P
 <br><br>
Anyway, I thought you might find that interesting, as it has a LOT of similarities with Neverwinter Nights.

I am a high school student who is sadly afflicted by a plethora of Macintosh, 
non-EverQuest computers. However, after my boyfriend, an avid player, 
introduced the game to me, I rapidly became obssesed (I'm buying a PC!). I 
have enjoyed your publication immensely, and I have read all the back issues. 
Today, while on the Sony EverQuest website, I saw a news post which both 
interested and inspired me. This post referred to the Common Law on Fennin Ro 
server. I think you all should investigate this fantastic roleplaying 
development. The web site is www.sok.org.fenninro . This idea has inspired me 
to (when I finaly get to play!) join the Fennin Ro server.

Dear Editor,
<br><br>
Could you please pass on my thanks to Nepenthia for her great articles? I've
printed off everything from http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/credits/nepen.htm 
I'm not sure my life is better since I've been playing EQ, but it has been
different and my existence out of the game in work/family has changed. I
think for the better, but I haven't been advancing myself in learning as
much as before. Still always make it to work though.  Now if I can just get
a handle of how to exist in my EQ dream world while sleeping, when I go to
input a keyboard command with no keyboard. Can't tell you how many times
I've mistaken my alarm clock for a piece of computer equipment<g>.
I used to read SF back years ago, and used to dream on a regular basis. My
dreams had stopped as well as my life in a mystical environment. Since
playing EQ my dreams exist as I walk down the hall. Very strange....
How about the time distortion effect? Time in this world speeds up so after
spending a seemingly short period of time in the game, massive volumes of
time have gone by. 
<br><br>
Sincerely, <br>
