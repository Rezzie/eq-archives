He continued to listen, and heard that many generations ago there 
had been a giant Wyrm named Krysthanir inhabiting the area, causing the 
human villages nearby a great deal of distress and brought death to those 
who tried to stop it. This continued for several years until a wandering 
paladin who left no name and carried an enchanted sword battled the beast 
and returned alive. Legend has it that Krysthanir was not destroyed, but 
merely had been imprisoned by the sword's powerful magic. However, its raids 
on the villages were over, and the people rejoiced, not even caring how it 
had came to be. The paladin moved on as quietly as he had arrived.

Although the legends of the area do not tell what happened, Raylend 
alone knew the rest of the story. It had been his great grandfather, Yari, 
who battled the Wyrm that day. The sword he had carried was now sheathed at 
Raylend's waist, still shining as if it were new. Yari had sacrificed the 
magic in the sword to generate a powerful enchantment that turned Krysthanir 
back into its youngest form. The spell had so drained Yari, that he fell 
unconscious. When he awoke, the Wyrm was no where to be found. Content that 
the threat was over, he returned to the village. He accepted no thanks for 
what he had done, and merely went on his way knowing he had helped the 
helpless. His god was pleased.

Recently, Raylend heard rumors that a large snake had been spotted 
again in the area, and came to investigate. His fear was that this was 
Krysthanir, as either a young Wyrm or in some modified form caused by the 
enchantment. With no magic remaining in the sword, he could not afford to 
wait until it was fully grown. Raylend was a paladin, like his father and 
his father before him, and knew it was his duty to finish the job his 
ancestor had begun. He knew he had to destroy the threat for good. The next 
morning, he set off for the mountains.
