					<p>Our Data Center is a world-class facility, and the first of its kind
					  in San Diego. Completed in March of 1998, our 2000 square-foot,
					  150 rack Data Center meets the high security and protection
					  demands of any Internet presence. The SimpleNet Data Center has redundant
					  systems for connectivity, electrical power, air conditioning and fire
					  suppression to ensure that your Internet presence is always available.</p>

					<p>The SimpleNet Data Center is monitored 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and 365 days per year. Our staff is committed and trained to provide you with continual, high-level network monitoring and load management of your connection. In addition, we offer engineering support for outage response, network performance analysis and network planning.</p>

					<p>SimpleNet maintains connections to multiple upstream providers to provide
					  redundancy and reliability for your connection to the Internet.
					  These connections are multiple DS-3s (45Mb/s) with providers
					  such as Sprint, Level3, MCI and XO Communications. SimpleNet
					  optimizes the path your data takes so your customers don't
					  have to wait.</p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2>Network Operations Center (NOC)</h2></div>

					<p>SimpleNet's NOC is manned 24 hours, 7 days a week 365 days a year. This provides continual, high-level SNMP monitoring and management of customer connections. In addition, the SimpleNet NOC offers engineering support for outage response, network performance analysis and planning.</p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2> Environmental Systems</h2></div>

					<p>The SimpleNet Data Center features a positive pressure, computer clean room with double filtration of fresh air before entering the center. In addition each air conditioner continuously filters the air within the room.</p>

					<p>The Data Center offers up to 60 tons of redundant air conditioning. Each
					  of the 6 air conditioning units handles 10 tons of cooling
					  capacity and is fully independent from other units. This allows maintenance
					  to be performed or a failure of a unit without affecting your Internet
					  presence.</p>

					<p>In order to provide optimum performance, the condensing units are located on the same floor as the Data Center and are vented outside through custom louvers designed specifically for SimpleNet.</p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2>Inergen&#8482; Fire Supression</h2></div>

					<p>Inergen&#8482; is an environmentally green, three-dimensional fire suppression agent. Inergen&#8482; provides Data Centers with a non-water based agent that:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Is electrically nonconductive</li>
						<li>Is safe for use in human occupied facilities</li>
						<li>Does not damage sensitive electronic equipment</li>
						<li>Has zero ozone depletion, zero global warming, and zero atmospheric lifetime</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Inergen&#8482; is a blend of three naturally occurring gases &ndash; Nitrogen, Argon, and Carbon Dioxide. stored in cylinders within the Data Center.</p>

					<p>The Inergen&#8482; system is like no other modern suppression system in use today. This system lowers the oxygen content of the room to a point sufficient to sustain human life, but insufficient to support combustion.</p>

					<p>Because its not a chemical agent, the Inergen&#8482; gas will not produce a heavy fog the way other extinguishing agents do, so escape routes remain visible. The Inergen&#8482; gas discharges through specially designed nozzles fitted with discharge deflectors so that turbulence is minimized.</p>

					<div class="subtitles"><h2>SimpleNet Power Grid</h2></div>

					<p>The SimpleNet Data Center offers a robust, redundant power source. This redundancy starts with an APC Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system that is made up of four 40 KVA units running in parallel for a total capacity of 160 KVA.</p>

					<p>Like the air conditioning systems any one of these units can be taken off line for maintenance without effecting the protection of the room.</p>

					<p>The UPS will carry the electrical load of the Data Center in the event
					  of a power failure. Even under normal conditions each 20 amp circuit in
					  the Data Center is UPS "conditioned" from
					  the power sags and spikes that can occur with utility power.
					  If any power failure last longer that a minute or so the SimpleNet 450
					  KW diesel generator will start up and supply the electrical load for as
					  long as is necessary. This generator has a 240 gallon fuel tank that can
					  be refueled from the street, indefinitely if the need arises.</p>
