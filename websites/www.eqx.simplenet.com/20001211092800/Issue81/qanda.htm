<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are level 12 with Bind and Bind yourself to let's say, Blackburrow. Then you die while inside and lose your level and go back to level 11 will you still be bound to Blackburrow? Or that last place that you where bound at level 11?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No.  You will always appear at the site of your last binding, regardless of who bound you, loss of level, or otherwise.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you happen to know the reason why when my barbarian shaman equips a shield it does not show up on my character?  I know this is minor but it irks me to not see my character wearing that new kite shield I bought when I have it equipped.

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an old old bug from the beta days.  I remember being quite as annoyed as you when I was playing my Barb Rogue.  Not quite sure why that is the way it is, but I'm sure that Verant will get around to fixing it one of these days.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm fairly new (lvl 4 magician, on the Veeshan server. I'm on Odis based in Erudin. What can I do apart from just wandering around aimlessly killing monsters to gain experience and money. I've only found one other place so far (other side of bridge against mountain range, but I can't enter it. Are there any other buildings (dungeons, towers, etc) to access, or quests to perform. How do I reach another continent? No ships appear in harbor in Erudin.
- Soulforge
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, ships DO appear in the harbor at Erudin, I've sailed on them myself.  Could be that when you were waiting for one, they were temporarily out of service.  Go and have another sit down at the docks.  Bring a fishing pole, and relax a bit.  I promise, a boat will show.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember reading in the Official EverQuest FAQ a long, long time ago that there would be player and guild owned houses available for purchase.  I have been playing EverQuest for a while now, and have neither heard of, nor seen any such structure. Say it isn't so, but was this feature removed?
- Falx
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Less removed than not implemented yet.  Hopefully we will see this in the near future.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the deal with Lore, Pending Lore items? What will happen when they patch these Pending Lore items? I have a Bloodclaw(Pending Lore) and a Dragoon Dirk(Lore), will I lose one? Will they tell us when this patch will take place? Thanks,
- Deoful
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd have to go back to the Vault archives to be absolutely sure, but I believe what Brad said was that duplicate "pending lore" items will be deleted in a patch at some point in the future.  So I'd get a new one if you'd like that Bloodclaw to be a permanent part of your equipment.
