<b><u>Prolog</b></u>
<br><br>
	Sinuous coils slowly unwrapped themselves from their obsidian perch.  The ponderous body, lifted erect by the reptilian motion, began to move forward.  Broad shoulders atop a barrel-like chest branched out into muscular arms which ended in sharp, raking talons.  Above the shoulders, a blank nothingness.  No facial features, no expression, no gleam of intellect or humor adorned that massive brow. The air, thick and moist with the stink of fear and despair, roiled about the gigantic form as it moved with a silent whisper across the stark landscape, for here, on the Plane of Terror, lived Cazic-Thule.  
<br><br>
	Terror was what he breathed, filling his lungs with the rank stench of horror and misery.  Terror was what he sought, especially now.  New terror, fresh from eyes made sightless, from tongues torn out with hot tongs, from throats burning from screams of agony, was what kept him alive and whetted his appetite for more.
<br><br>
	"Meldrath!"
<br><br>
	The thought, propelled through the planes to the world of Norrath, entered Meldrath's mind like a pile driver.
<br><br>
	"Yes, oh mighty one?"  Stars danced in Meldrath's head as Cazic-Thule's diabolic thoughts impacted his.  His mind felt as if an iron hand gripped it like a ripe fruit, ready to squeeze or release it at the slightest whim.
<br><br>
	"You may begin."
<br><br>
<hr color="black">	
	<p style="text-align: justify">
	Slipping between the hedge and the fence, Oghma dropped to the ground and slithered across on his stomach to the walls of the old dwarf's house.  As he flattened his back against the wall, preparing to peek into the window, he listened carefully to make sure the old priest had not returned.  Hearing nothing, he raised his eyes over the windowsill.
<br><br>
	The room inside was filled with books.  Books in shelves, books on tables, books on chairs.  To his young mind these books were objects of wonder and mystery, promises and fears, the complete recounting of life and dwarf and everything.  The old priest never let anyone into this room, always locking the classroom door at lunch time while the other children went home to their parents.  Oghma's parents were always in the mines, so the pastry baked by his mother served as lunch, and Oghma watched Fergus in his private study leaf through pages of musty (or so he imagined) tomes, learning of faraway places. 
<br><br>
	Like his father, Oghma was expected to work in the mines, and he had his fathers' strength. Able to swing a miner's pick one-handed at the age of eight, a feat his father boasted of around the tables at the taverns in town, Oghma was expected to join his father in the mines as soon as he was of the age of apprenticeship.  Oghma, however, had a fierce curiosity his father lacked, and instead of accompanying his father to the mines, spent his time in town asking his questions to all and sundry.  Quick-witted and charming, he made friends with all the craftsmen, and his special friend was the smith, Giobhniu. Many were the nights his father had to come to Giobhniu's smithy and drag Oghma away from the heat and sparks of the forge.
<br><br>
	In the far corner of the room, an old harp leaned against an overstuffed chair.  Oghma had never seen the old dwarf play it, but Oghma knew that Fergus had traveled much.
<br><br>
	Fergus wasn't there!  Oghma realized that the room was empty, and slipped over to the windowsill and gently pushed on the sash.  It gave!  Oghma pushed up the sash and slid into the room, looking around for the wisdom of the ages.
<br><br>
	On the table was a map.  Oghma peeked at it and saw it was a map of the world of Norrath, from the top.  Most maps Oghma had seen were maps that were from the dwarven perspective, the Undermountain view.  This map had a trail of lines going from the Butcherblock Mountains to all sorts of lands.  Could this be the journeys of Fergus?  Oghma traced his finger along the lines, and noticed dates written all along them. Oghma saw multiple journeys from the mountain, traced over 100 years.  Some of the places on the map looked like they were added later, as if when the map was originally written, they did not exist.
	<br><br>
"What do you think of my map, Oghma?" called a voice from the door.
<br><br>
	Oghma gasped and turned around.  Fergus! Now he was in trouble! Fergus was very strict about not letting anyone in here.  Excuses and evasions raced through Oghma's mind.
<br><br>
	"Uh, well, uh…", Oghma stammered.
<br><br>
	"It's alright, Ogh, I have seen you at my window for weeks.  I had been hoping your curiosity would get the best of you.  Now, what do you think of my map?"
	<br><br>
	Oghma met often with Fergus during lunchtime, and learned of his travels throughout Norrath.  Wild tales of adventurers, stories of elf lords and orc raids filled Oghma's mind.  On weekends, Fergus would teach him dwarven history and religion, saying it was a better companion than most on those cold nights. His parent's dreams for him fell by the wayside, and Oghma's scholarship drew him into the priesthood.
<br><br>
	On his 41st birthday, after Oghma had had years of study, and was a young priest of Brell Serelis, Fergus fell ill.  The dwarven clerics could not find a reason, nor a cure for his illness.  Oghma spent many hours with Fergus, watching as he got weaker, singing songs to cheer him, arguing fine points of history with him, and learning as much as Fergus could teach him.
<br><br>
	After the long wasting sickness, Fergus called for Oghma late one night.
<br><br>
	"Ogh," Fergus said, "I want you to have my harp.  I hope it is as good a companion for you as it was for me."
<br><br>
	Oghma shook his head, "No, please I couldn't."
<br><br>
	Fergus coughed heavily, a damp sound issuing from his throat. "Yes, you will, because I said so.  You wouldn't want to go against the wishes of a dying dwarf, would you?"
<br><br>
	Oghma smiled wanly at his teacher's attempt at humor.  "I will cherish it, and I promise to be sure to change the strings often, I know you think I don't change them enough!"
<br><br>
	"And Ogh, I want you to leave the Undermountain.", Fergus said.  "I want you to leave tomorrow.  I have already spoken to your father, and he agrees. If you truly wish to come to an understanding of who you are, and why you have the gifts you have, you must go, and wander Norrath.  You must go above ground and meet the elves, see the ogres and trolls, and meet the humans."
<br><br>
	Oghma sat in thought for a while.  He had often contemplated leaving, not knowing if he should interrupt his studies, yearning to see what he was learning about.  He had saved up few gold pieces to go to Odus and visit Paneel, the Erudite city of scholars.  There he could study with the great minds of the age, and learn tales of places unknown to him.
<br><br>
	"When you come back, Oghma, you need to tell the dwarves what you have seen.  Norrath is changing, and we must change with it.  You must do this." Fergus' raspy voice broke Oghma's thoughts.  "We dwarves think that as long as we stay in the Undermountain, we will be safe.  That is no longer true.  There are forces gathering, some malevolent, some chaotic, that could change the face of Norrath forever.  Seek out good companions.  Don't fall into slovenly habits.  And one more thing… go to the Traveler's Home in Felwithe first. Remember, Oghma, you are my best student, and our best hope."
<br><br>
	With this, Fergus closed his eyes, and put his head back on the pillow. Carrying a new and heavy burden, Oghma left the room… 
<br><br>
	And later that day, left Kaladim.
<br><br>

<br>
<b>Oghma says farewell to the guards, and to Kaladim</b></center>
<br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	"So I left the place.  I call it the house of rain, because of the moisture that was always dripping from the ceiling.  My last work was to melt down my sword.  The dwarf to whom I was apprenticed bid me farewell.  Funny thing is, no matter who I ask, nobody has ever seen that house."
<br><br>
Now he shook my hand.  Seemed a bit backwards to me that he would do it now, but like many elven customs, it was a means for sizing people up.  Not in a dwarven way, with two folks squeezing the daylights out of each other's fingers.  The guildmaster gripped my hand lightly.  High elven handshakes are typically a matter of subtlety.  I could see in his eyes that there was some puzzlement, as if he was having trouble discerning anything about me from my handshake.
<br><br>
	"Warrior," he muttered,  "Where are your blisters?"
<br><br>
	"I haven't swung a sword in seven years.  That's how long I was in the house of rain."
<br><br>
	"A most… original story.  Many come here to pledge this guild, from many walks of life.  As I recall, your father was a guard here in Felwithe."
<br><br>
	"Yes sir.  He died just a few weeks before my return.  I plan to visit his grave, but not until I am wearing a guild robe.  I was young and angry when I left.  I'd like his impression of me to be that I have grown and even changed a little."
<br><br>
	He nodded, lightly as his handshake.
<br><br>
	"With your seven years of work in the arts I find it odd then that you would pledge the Wizard's guild.  Typically artists lean toward enchantment."
<br><br>
	"I will be an enchanter some day.  I don't feel that calling now."
<br><br>
	He was masking surprise.
<br><br>
	"What do you mean?"
<br><br>
	"I stood beside the stone that would transport me to the Enchanter's guild and I had all the intentions in the world of going there.  This is going to sound strange, and I am loath to say it as it will certainly show badly on me…"
<br><br>
	The guildmaster crossed his arms and cocked his head just a few degrees; unmistakably the 'sign' which means 'get on with it'.
<br><br>

<br>

<br>
	"The color was wrong."
<br><br>
	"The… color?"
<br><br>
	"When I was a child my Aunt used to describe how she saw things as bright or dark.  I never understood exactly what she was talking about, but mark her words--If she said that something was dark then it was something to be avoided."
<br><br>
	"You see patterns of color."
<br><br>
	I'm sure I smiled at this.  In the years since I had first learned to speak, no one had understood what I was talking about when I referred to seeing the colors.  The very possibility that he knew what I was talking about gave me more pleasure than I could describe.
<br><br>
	"Yes!  Yes.  It's like things radiate color.  The banner on your guild shown so brightly to me."
<br><br>
	This caused another look on his face.  This one I couldn't comprehend.
<br><br>
	He turned and went to a table and picked up a freshly cleaned robe and tossed it to me.
<br><br>
	"That… that's it?" I said incredulously, "Well, thank you, sir."
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Magic theory is something you begin to study in youth, and as new theories develop you try and size them up to see where they fit into the puzzle.  Now here's the trick-the puzzle is infinite in size.  Magic is as unending, ever-changing, as life itself.  The reason there is no master is because it evolves and the master again becomes a novice.
<br><br>
	So imagine starting in the endeavor late, as I did.  All the symbols, signs, bits of old Erudin script, texts, grimoires, tomes, journals… all there to point you in opposite directions.
<br><br>
	I was half grateful, half panicked to see my things packed and sitting behind the door when I awoke in the library after a night of deciphering glyphs.
<br><br>
	"Is it something I did?"
<br><br>
	The guildmaster shook his head, "No, it's something you should do.  There is a traveler on his way here.  His name is Oghma.  He will be your guide."
<br><br>
	"He's a mentor?"
<br><br>
	"He's a dwarf.  You shall travel together.  Actually, there will be a group of you, of which you shall be the only wizard."
<br><br>
	"I'm hardly a wizard yet, sir," I offered.
<br><br>
	"There's only one place to practice offensive and defensive spells, and it isn't in the library."
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Oghma seemed friendly enough. I didn't gather much of a surface expression except that he had a good knowledge of the path between Felwithe and Kaladim, as he managed to journey all the way to me so that he could guide me back.
<br><br>
	I did my best to squeeze his hand back, alas with dwarves all you can do is hope the feeling comes back to your fingers to the full extent you had before the handshake.
<br><br>
	He also brought me a bit of a gift, which was quite beneficial later on.  My merely introductory knowledge of magic left me with one attack and one defensive spell.  So I was somewhat relieved when he handed me a rapier.  It was rusted and a bit dull comparatively, but it was certainly up to the task.
<br><br>
	For most of the journey I could only do my best to keep up.  For such a little fellow he was fleet of feet.  I trotted along and we were in Kaladim before dark.  The gates of Kaladim were fantastic.  The dwarven masons sculpted a spectacular statue of a dwarven warrior there.
<br><br>
	Oghma and I decided that while we waited for the others we would prowl the woods just a bit.  Turns out that there was no shortage of activity.
<br><br>
	He started by dispatching a goblin who charged us, shouting something about defiling his homeland.  Oghma made quick work of him.  He reached down and flipped the body over and took the sack off of it and handed it to me to carry my goods.
<br><br>
	We were beset by a rather large beetle, and Oghma's experience took over as he waded into the fray against the thing.  I assisted, but before the thing was dispatched another came along and began to attack from behind Oghma.  No sooner had we dispatched the first beetle and turned our attention to the second one then shambling out of the darkness came a skeleton.  It was rather short in stature, surely having risen from some dwarven battlefield not far off.  As soon as I struck it the ghastly thing turned its attentions toward me.
<br><br>
	Then there was another!  I was seeing double.  Two skeletons set upon me, their sockets dark, joints clinging to the bits of flesh that was once the signature of life.  Oghma took on the large and ungainly beetle while I dispatched the two skeletons with a speed and accuracy I'd thought left behind on a battlefield seven years earlier, to Oghma's exclamation, "Go, Arch!"
<br><br>
	We laid out an array of beasts and corpses there on the blanket of grass, in the shadows of the oak and evergreen.  When the fray was ended the blade was wet in my hand.  Oghma and I took a rest and awaited the others after scavenging the bodies for anything of use.
<br><br>
	As much as I enjoyed the fight, it frightened me.  I left a part of myself behind; the part that was anger filled and fueled by battle rage, yet here it resurfaced.  I put my hands beneath the bag I carried so that their shaking could not be seen by Oghma, and if he indeed noticed, he made no mention.
	<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Freegaze had run and maintained the Traveler's Home for as long as he could remember.  This morning as he opened up, he thought about the many patrons who had passed through, members of all races, some who had become regulars for a while, some who just passed through.  One of the many benefits to owning an inn was the many tales and lands he had heard of, without having to step from his hometown of Felwithe.
<br><br>
	 This morning so far had been a quiet one.  Sleepy travelers had yawned over the simple breakfasts they had ordered, and went out into the Greater Faydark to their travels to Kelethin and beyond, or stayed in Felwithe.  A bunch of wizards had come into town for some sort of conclave, and they had all left to the guild together, making the noisy common room suddenly silent.
<br><br>
	Freegaze drew himself a glass of wine, and sat down at his desk to look over the house accounts.  It was looking as though he'd have to take on another cleaning maid, because traffic had been so high lately.
<br><br>
	"Do you think they have anything besides that thin elven wine?"
<br><br>
	"What, the elf wine is thin?  I don't know, I've never had elf wine, but wine makes my head spin, just a little, like if I'd been sitting on the spindle of a windmill, spin-spin-spin, but I've never actually done that, maybe it'd be fun.  But not like drinking wine is fun, a different fun."
<br><br>
	Freegaze looked around but didn't see anyone.  He hadn't heard the door open, but he had recently oiled them, since common room patrons had complained about being woken up by the squeaking.  The first voice and been rumble-y and deep, the second an excitable reedy tenor.
<br><br>
	A stool scraped the floor and a young gnome in a bright yellow robe clambered up to stand on the stool.  Though young, the gnome's face had a slightly worried look, as if he had recently dropped something of value, or perhaps misplaced something.
<br><br>
	"Oghma wants to know if you have anything thicker than elven wine, I mean, not that elven wine is thin, I wouldn't know, but he's awfully thirsty and we've traveled quite far, and is elven wine thin?"
<br><br>
	Another stool scraped the floor and a young dwarf with a luxurious brown beard and a merry gleam in his eye appeared next to the gnome.
<br><br>
	"Hail innkeeper!" said the dwarf, who must be the one named Oghma, "What Mundas is saying, with his many words in an apparent random order, is this: do you have any thick, stout, dwarven ale for me?  Perhaps a little wine for Mundas, too, to assuage his curiosity about windmill spinning."
<br><br>
	Freegaze nodded and went over to a cask of ale nearby. "We get this from the Pub Kal in Kaladim, would that do?", Freegaze asked. 
<br><br>
	"Wonderful!" said Oghma.
<br><br>
	"So what brings you here, Oghma and Mundas?" asked Freegaze after he had poured out the drinks.
<br><br>
	"Well, I went to my guild master, who's really nice, though kind of strict, but he means well, but one time I had to copy a book three times because of a little spell I cast, just a little one, and how was I to know that his clothes would all turn purple, not a pretty pretty purple, but a purple that makes you feel sort of queasy, you know, like you had too many soft fruits all at once, yuck, that happened to me once…"
<br><br>
	"Mundas! Did you ever find that magical spider that you told me about?"
<br><br>
	Mundas climbed down the stool to his bag, where he upended it on the floor.  "It's in here somewhere, he said, I really need to be more organized…"
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<br><p style="text-align: justify">
Sometimes things that happen are pretty funny.  I mean, take this journal for example.  I never was very good at keeping track of things.  And now Mistress Urncaller wants me to write down all the details of my life!  I'm only good at details when it comes to my work, but I'll do my best.  Heck, it might even be fun.
<br><br>
	Ak'Anon is where I was born...  Am I supposed to go this far back?  Well, I will anyhow.  My parents are still my best friends.  They never forced me into their work.  They let me do whatever I wanted.  And I wanted to learn to make things.  I love to make things that haven't been made before. That's how I came to join the Enchanters.  I'm not so keen on the idea of enchanting people.  But they tell me that it's important to learn it.  I want to enchant my creations.  That's why I made that little spider as my final project.  I keep it here in my bag.
<br><br>
The rest of this story was transcribed by Oghma.
<br><br>
	"You want to know about me?  About my life?  I've kept a journal!  I have it here..."
<br><br>
	After several minutes of searching through his pockets Mundas handed me a single piece of parchment.
<br><br>
	"Do you like this robe?  It was given to me three years ago when I was accepted into the Enchanters Guild.  I know, it has some holes in it.  It's not all that colorful.  I mean, I like yellow, but one day I will have a robe made for me that has some purple in it too.  And some green.  I like green.  And I want to trim it with gold.  Not real gold, but gold colored fringe.  Nothing lacy, though.  Fluffy stuff gets caught in my work."
<br><br>
	"Oh, my trip?  It was very interesting.  Lots of fun!  I mean, it was my first real trip.  I've been too busy learning my craft to travel.  Did I tell you?  I just learned how to make people stronger!  Not that I really need to know how to do that.  Except when I have to kill something.  I don't particularly like to kill things.  But sometimes you just have to. Just to earn enough money to get here I had to go hunt skeletons.  Somehow there are a bunch of animated bones outside Ak'Anon.  Someone is making undead out of my kinfolk!  Shocking!  But have you seen them walk?  It's amazing that they can do that!  They are a bit clumsy, but then you would be too, if you had no flesh.  At least I think you would..."
<br><br>
	"So I killed a few of these skeletons.  Can they be killed?  Is that the right word?  Well, one of them had a sword.  It must have been buried with him it was so rusty.  Why would anyone bury a sword with a corpse?  Isn't that a bit silly?  I'm sure it was a fine weapon before they buried it. Even rusty I was able to trade it with the guild merchant for a scroll. That's the one that showed me how to make people stronger.  But like I said, I'm not all that interested in enchanting people.  I want to make my creations magical.  Hey!  Let me show you my spider!"
<br><br>
	Again several minutes passed while Mundas searched his pockets and pouches for the item in question.  By now many interesting things had spilled from his pockets onto the table and floor.
<br><br>
	"I gotta organize this stuff better.  I can't find the spider.  What?  Oh, sure, I'll show you later.  Oh, yea, my trip.  Well, I was given a note and told to meet with some people in Felwithe.  At first I was a bit scared. Felwithe is a long way from Ak'Anon.  And these High Elves are a strange bunch.  I mean, they're nice and all.  But they don't seem to trust me. They seem to think that I'm here to cause some sort of trouble.  Like I was some meddlesome Halfling.  Not that I don't like Halflings.  In fact, I've never met one.  But I hear that they are troublesome.  But then, I suppose there aren't too many Halflings in Felwithe.  Not any Gnomes that I've seen either.  But with a trip like that I can see why."
<br><br>
	"I never would have made it myself if a kindly and worldly fellow hadn't given me some tips.  I can't 'member his name.  Sorry.  But he gave me some useful directions.  I can't hardly tell North from East, so I had to have him tell me in left and right terms.  He was a handsome fellow too.  His hair was gray, not a stylish color like mine.  With a bit of work I think I could change yours to match mine.  Or if you don't like green, perhaps I can make it purple.  I don't know of any other colors that are safe for hair.  But orange would only sting for a short time.  And the hair grows back.  It's just that the chemicals in the dye are...  Oh, sure.  Lots of folks are attached to their original hair color."
<br><br>
	"So I said goodbye to the gate guards, Prenn and Prynn.  Twins.  They stand guard over the gates of Ak'Anon most of the days and nights.  Sturdy fellows.  There are lots of stories about what they've done to protect us. I figured that there was a chance I'd never see them again.  But the idea of the trip made me laugh.  The twins didn't laugh with me though.  Lots of people don't.  But I waved at them anyway, and walked out into the rain.  It rains a lot there.  I'm surprised that the carrier spiders don't rust!  I followed one for a while towards the entrance to Lesser Faydark. It was pretty dry under its belly.  And the way it works!  Fascinating.  If you stood more than a few feet from one you would never know that it wasn't a real spider!  Well, except that it's so big.  Spiders never get that big.  I mean, you don't believe those stories about giant black widow spiders in Lesser Faydark, do you?  I figure they're just runaway carriers."
<br><br>
	"Well, I guess I'm not supposed to make a big deal out of it.  I'm probably not even supposed to talk about it.  But sometimes the clockworks go mad. They run away sometimes.  I saw a few on my way here.  I was told to stay away from them.  Some of them hate those that made them.  Imagine it!  They hate their parents!  Makes no sense.  I love my parents.  They made me who I am.  You love your parents, right?  Who doesn't!  I guess that's why they say those runaways are crazy."
<br><br>
<center><a href="spider6.htm"><img src="spider61.jpg"></a>
<br>
<b>Mundas scrambles along underneath the clockwork spider</b></center>
<br>
	"Oh, well, after I left the cover of the carrier I turned left.  The rain was pretty heavy.  So heavy that I never saw the puma until I was almost touching it!  It was a beautiful thing!  It's fur was a bit dull.  Sort of tan.  But it kept the water off it.  And its underside was white.  A pure white like you see in rabbits.  We sometimes keep rabbits.  They make good test subjects.  How do you think that I found out about that orange dye? Well, the puma growled at me.  I slowly backed away, and it left me alone. I was chuckling out loud when it bounded off.  Those things move smoothly. I think that's probably why I've never seen a clockwork puma.  Or any cat for that matter.  Some day I hope to make one.  I would love to figure out how to give that kind of grace to a clockwork.  Not that I've ever even made a clockwork.  The spider is just a toy.  It doesn't move or anything. Let me find it and show it to..."
<br><br>
	"Okay, later.  Just after the cat left I found the entrance to Lesser Faydark.  It was a tall canyon cut into the hills.  I went inside a bit nervous.  Folks tell me that I tend to laugh when I'm nervous.  Maybe.  But at least I can see the fun parts of things that others don't like.  I mean, when we had that small fire in class I thought it was funny!  You should have seen everyone running around!  And Pertiga will probably never grow his beard back!  So I suppose I was giggling a lot when I came out on the other side of the pass."
<br><br>
	"It's dark in Lesser Faydark!  I guess that's why they call it that.  I wondered if I would be able to see at all once I got to Greater Faydark. There was fog there all the time.  Well, all the time that I was there.  But the first thing that I saw when I stepped into Lesser Faydark was Happ Dremblenod and his shop!  Not that I knew who he was.  I still don't, really.  He wasn't interested in talking to me much.  I pestered him and his clockworks.  But I guess I wasn't welcome.  But it sure was nice to see a Gnome out there.  Made me feel safer."
<br><br>
	"In fact, he was the only thing that I saw there.  Except for the fog.  I was glad that I had those directions.  Lesser Faydark is not the kind of place for a Gnome like me.  It wasn't all that long until I found the valley that lead to Greater Faydark.  But I couldn't tell that I was in a new place.  It looked as dark and foggy as Lesser Faydark.  Trouble was, by then I was lost.  Very lost.  At least in Ak'Anon we have tunnels and guides to let you know which way to go.  Nobody gets lost in Ak'Anon."
<br><br>
	"But I got lucky!  I ran into a High Elf.  He was very nice.  His name was Midari.  He led me to the entrance to the city.  Have you seen it!  It's beautiful!  All gold and marble.  Tall towers.  Battlements.  Just beautiful.  But a bit sterile, really.  I mean, nothing moves.  I sorta figured it would be all trees and stuff.  I always thought Elves liked trees.  Well, anyway, that's how I got here.  How was your trip?  What does that mean, a word in edgewise?  Is that some Dwarfish saying?  Never heard it before..."

Deft as a finely sliced dagger.  Agile as the blue-hued moon. Quick as a feathery rose petal.  All very good descriptions for one very unique wood elf.  Squire danced across the wooden platform, a common sight in his treetop home of Kelethin, and hummed merrily a tune he had never heard.   The words did not come to him, but he was certain that they told of his swift sword and quick wit.  Confidence, above all else, propelled this young bard to seek out the most important of tasks.  This trait did not go unnoticed by his guildmaster.
<br><br>
	"Oh, Squiiiiirre," Sylia Windlehand sang to him from inside the guild hall. "Could you come in here for a moment?"
<br><br>
	Naturally, Squire noticed the urgency in his voice, which could only mean one thing.  There was an important matter to attend to, and he was the only one who could handle it.  He threw open the doors and dashed into the room with a spring in his step.
<br><br>
	"What can I do you for, big guy?"   Squire's jovial, informal manner grated on Sylia's nerves, but he hid his gritting teeth behind a forced smile.  
<br><br>
	"I have an important job for you.  Meet up with a group at the Traveler's Home in Felwithe.  And," he added, "be discreet."   
<br><br>
	"Ahhhh.  I understand completely," Squire said with a wink.  "I'll be there in a jiffy!"  With that, he bounded out of the building and kicked his heels into the air.  As soon as the doors closed behind him, he took a full breath of the forest air and shouted, "I'm on a mission, and I'm headed to Felwithe!" 
<br><br>

<br>
<b>Sylia, happy to see Squire go</b></center>
<br>
	"I said, BE DISCREET," a voice called from behind the door.
<br><br>
	And so, very quietly and nearly a whisper, Squire said to himself, "I'm on a mission, and I'm headed to Felwithe."
<br><br>
	Behind him, a man loudly cleared his throat. Squire looked a little startled and quickly went on his way.  
<br><br>
	Across one bridge, down one ramp, from platform to platform, Squire raced through the treetops.  He felt completely safe, although one wrong step would lead to making a good impression on the forest floor below.  He thought to himself as he headed for the bottom that he needn't take the long way.  True to form, he came up with a quick plan to cut his time.  Reaching in his backpack, he removed a length of rope and quickly tied a knot around the railing.  
<br><br>
	He paused.  How would he be able to retrieve the rope when he reached the bottom?  He acted.  A slip knot would allow him to tug the rope and collect it safely from the ground level.  After the quick alteration he leapt smoothly over the railing, clutching the rope for an easy climb down.  Needless to say, as the slip knot slipped, the rope offered no support, and Squire's descent was much quicker than planned.  His intelligence had once again gotten the better of him.  
<br><br>
	Through a cluster of trees, a passing cleric heard the shout of, "I'm flyiiinnngg," followed by a soft thud.  Upon investigating, she found our hero semi-conscious on the ground with a messy coil of rope laying across his chest.  The cleric sighed, realizing that this one will be needing help quite often.  
<br><br>
	She did not think twice about summoning her magical energies, however, as her vows to aid the wounded and help those in need made the decision a quick and easy one.  Around her billowed globes of bluish light, as she focused her thoughts upon Squire.  In a flash the globes circled him and collapsed into his body.
<br><br>
	Squire instantly felt better, and got to his feet saying, "Thank you, my lady."  He did not make eye contact as he gathered his belongings and scurried away.  Safely out of sight, he giggled to himself, and thought, "All according to plan!"
<br><br>
	The trip to Felwithe was rather uneventful.  He saw an occasional black wolf or decaying skeleton, but he easily avoided these encounters. There were more important things to do.  
<br><br>
	Finally, he saw the white stone entrance to Felwithe.  The high elves here got along well with their woodland kin, but naturally each race considered themselves to be the superior.  
<br><br>
	"How ya doin?" Squire asked the guard at the gate.  The guard's eyes shifted to look at him, then rolled upwards before shifting back to look straight ahead.
<br><br>
	"Okay, catch you later."  Squire gave the guard a friendly slap on the shoulder and passed into the city beyond.  
<br><br>
	It was a beautiful city, if you liked living on the ground.  A stream of water flowed through it, offering plenty of fishing spots and a serene atmosphere.  The white stone buildings gave it a bright feel, and everything seemed to have a mild glow to it.  To Squire, it seemed that the city was built with the aid of magic.
<br><br>
	He quickly made his way to the Traveler's Home, an inn near the entrance of the city.  Although he had never been there, he had passed by it many times.  The door opened easily, and he stepped inside saying, "I'm here! Who wants me?"
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Getting ready for the lunchtime customers took up most of the late morning.  Freegaze had had trouble recently finding enough royal jelly from the giant wasp drones that roamed the Greater Faydark, but a recent influx of adventurers had enabled him to stockpile enough so that he could make his royal jelly waybreads.  He needed to remember to send one of the tavern boys out to cry it in the streets, because the traveling folks thought highly of it.  He was sure to have a big demand.
<br><br>
	The doors suddenly swung open and a young wood elf strode through, loudly "I'm here! Who wants me?" The mostly empty common room echoed back a disinterested silence as the door hit the wall and rebounded back, almost hitting the young elf.  Nimbly dodging the door, the elf looked around, unabashed, and strode to the bar where Freegaze was washing some of the morning's breakfast dishes.
<br><br>
	"Innkeeper!", the elf exclaimed. "I am Squire, the bard, and someone here has need of my excellent services.  I have been sent by my master to fulfill an important task, a noble deed, a feat none other than myself could attempt!  I ask you, do you know who has come to seek me out?"
<br><br>
	Freegaze had difficulty retaining a laugh.  This young elf certainly had a high opinion of himself.  Freegaze put down the earthenware plate he was washing and put a puzzled look on his face.
<br><br>
	"Young sir, no, I have not heard of someone seeking you."  Freegaze replied. "Perhaps your party has not arrived yet?"
<br><br>
	Squire looked around.  All he saw was a dwarf, an elf, and a gnome sitting at one of the tables, engaged in some conversation, and not really paying attention to him.  Scattered throughout the bar, were various elves preparing to leave.  Whoever was waiting for him wouldn't be leaving, so he strode over to the table where the dwarf and gnome sat. Squire pulled a chair back and turned it around, straddling it as he sat down facing the two.  "I am Squire, and I hear you have need of me!"
<br><br>
	The elf, wrapped up in some book, ignored him.
<br><br>
	Oghma looked up from the notes he was jotting down.  Glancing up at him, he held up a finger in admonishment. "Please wait," Oghma said. "I've finally got Mundas on a relevant topic, and I need to get this down before he gets distracted."
<br><br>
	Mundas looked at Squire. "Oghma, look! I didn't see any wood elves in the Lesser Faydark when I went through it, it's was too foggy, and do you think wood elves are afraid of the fog, that might be why?  Hey, are you afraid of fog, friend elf, or do you just sleep late, and that's why you weren't out and about?  Is that what all wood elves wear, by the way, that sort of dark brown tunic-thing with the neat green arrows on the front?  It's not bright enough, really, though I guess it doesn't look that bad, I'd brighten it up with some purple embroidery, I like purple."
<br><br>
	"Brell's teeth!" Oghma scowled.  "Now look what you did!"
<br><br>
	Squire looked a bit dazzled, as if he had asked for a drink of water and received a waterfall instead. "Um, no, I don't know why you haven't seen any wood elves yet.  And thanks, everyone thinks I dress well.  It's how I attract so many admirers."
<br><br>
	Oghma snorted.  "Right.  So, what was your question?"
<br><br>
	"My guild master sent me here to meet somebody for an important mission.  Are you the ones I'm supposed to meet?
<br><br>
	Oghma looked thoughtful.  "You know, Mundas, Archanalia and I were also asked to be here by our masters."
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Oghma looked at Freegaze. "It's odd, really, when you come to think of it.  We have very little in common - I'm a dwarf, a priest of Brell, and storyteller.  Mundas is an enchanter, Squire a bard, and Archanalia a wizard.  We have different professions and races, but there is no unifying link - except that all of our guildmasters asked us to come meet someone here.  It's almost as if we are being tested.  Is there, perhaps a note or a message here for any one of us?"
<br><br>
	Freegaze nodded.  "I received a note yesterday, with some money to hire a room for a few days for all of you.  I wasn't really sure who the note applied to, but now I see that your group fits the bill."
<br><br>
	"Could  I see the note?" Oghma asked.
<br><br>
	"Sure." The innkeeper reached over to the message board, then stopped, puzzled.  "It was just here yesterday.  That's odd."  He frowned.
<br><br>
	"Do you remember the text?  What was written on it?"
<br><br>
	"It said something like:  When the group sent by their masters arrives, give them the key to your best room."
<br><br>
	"Was it signed?"  Oghma leaned farther forward, over the counter.
<br><br>
	"It was, but I can't remember the name.  I'll have to think on it." Freegaze looked pensive.  "I think that it was an elfish name, but I'm not sure."
<br><br>
	"Well, at least we'll get a good nights' sleep!  Could I have the key?"  After receiving the key to the room, Oghma walked over to the assembled group "Squire, Mundas, and Archanalia.  The innkeeper said that whoever sent us here wanted us to have the best room, and here's the key.  Anyone ready to go?"
	<br><br>
Everyone agreed that it was time to get a good nights sleep, so they gathered their belongings and trooped down the hall.  Unlocking the door to the right revealed a large room with several beds, some tables and a fireplace with a warm fire crackling merrily against the east wall.  The south wall had a window which looked out over the open courtyard, with the north wall being the wall which had the entry door in it.  The ceilings were hung with middle-quality tapestries which were more of insulation value than decorative.  
<br><br>
	"Wow", Squire exclaimed, "This is a great room! I hope we can say here all week! Dibs on this bed!  No! This one…   Maybe… yes! This is the one!"
