<p style="text-align: justify">
	
	The young bard cautiously walked up to the tavern door.  He had been there before, but the last time he was there he had run into an old "friend" who he wished to avoid.  He was thirsty, however, so he chanced coming to the tavern once again.  Quietly, he peeked inside.  "No sign of him," he thought.  "It's safe."
<br><br>
	The young bard looked around for a while, observing the tavern and its inhabitants.  After a while, he figured he had seen enough and casually made his way up to the bar.  
<br><br>
	"Your strongest ale, please, kind sir," he said to the barkeep.
<br><br>
	Looking back at the bard with a calm face, the bartender replied, "Are ye sure yuir even old enough ta be drinkin' lad?  Besides, even if ye were, I don't know ye.  So, ye'll be paying up front if ye want a drink from me."
<br><br>
	"As for your questions, yes, I am young, but I assure you that I am plenty old enough to be drinking.  You say that you do not know me, but soon you will.  My name is Shandar, the wandering bard.  As for payment, that, sir may be a problem, for I am terribly short on cash," replied the bard, for he never paid for anything if he could find some way around it.  "Perhaps I could pay with what I do best.  How about a good story to earn your ale?"
<br><br>
	"Aye, all right.  And if I don't like your story, I'll put ye ta work to pay off yuir tab."
<br><br>
	"Alright," replied the bard.  "Although I am admittedly young, I have heard many stories in my time in this land.  I think, perhaps, you will appreciate this one most, however.  This is the story of Mordare the necromancer.  It is a story full of tragedy and loss, and hopefully, if you ever see this poor soul in your travels, it will help you to understand why he turned to the black arts.  And so I begin..."
<br><br>

	"Hurry up Mordare!" yelled Jazpha.  "We're supposed to meet Vordraz at sunset."
<br><br>
	"I'm coming, I'm coming, but its still hours until sunset, and even if we are late, Vordraz will wait.  What's the big deal?"
<br><br>
	"Oh, come on Mordare!  What's the big deal!?  We're about to set off on the journey of our lives, and you have the nerve to ask 'What's the big deal!?'"
<br><br>
	Mordare moved closer to Jazpha and gently touched her on the cheek, "You know I didn't mean it like that Jazpha.  It's just that once we set off, we may be gone for months; I was really hoping we could spend some time together.  You know, go for a walk and <em>other things</em>.
<br><br>
	"Well, if we're going for a walk, let's go," she replied.  "As for '<em>other things</em>,' we'll just have to see if you deserve that."
<br><br>
	So, they gathered a few belongings and left to walk in the privacy outside of Neriak.  They gradually made their way to the surface.  Mordare babbled on about their future life, and they wandered farther and farther from the entrance to Neriak.
<br><br>
	"Just think," said Mordare.  "After today, we'll be out exploring the world, seeing new things.  Then, when we've seen all there is to see and done all there is to do, we will settle down in Neriak.  I will be the greatest enchanter in all of Neriak, and you, of course, will be raising our children to become the finest little warriors and wizards Neriak has ever seen."
<br><br>
	"Whoa there!" exclaimed Jazpha.  "I'm not ready to be a mother just yet."  Then more seriously, she turned to Mordare and asked, "Mordare?  Where are we?  I can't see Neriak."
<br><br>
	"Oh not to worry," he said.  "It's that way, just over that hill."
<br><br>
	So, the two lovers began making their way back.  Then Mordare heard a noise, a twig snapping.  Normally, he would have ignored it, but this far from home, it was dangerous.  He turned to look only to be laid out by a fast-moving fist.  Down he went, at the hands of a wood elf ranger.
<br><br>
	"Run!" Mordare shouted. "Run, Jazpha run!!"
<br><br>
	But she would not leave him, and the two lovers were quickly overtaken by an elven war party.
<br><br>
	Mordare awoke and saw that they had been dragged out of sight.  The party was composed mainly of high elves, with a single wood elf ranger as their guide.  They had seen combat before, for they had the scars and armor to prove it.  Mordare finally managed to sputter out some words.
<br><br>
	"How... How did you get so close?" he asked.
<br><br>
	"That's not for you to know you, stinking Teir'dal bastard!" shouted a high elf cleric.  "Your race is an abomination to all elves."
<br><br>
	Just then a voice spoke up from the back of the crowd.  A wizard and two paladins stepped forward, carrying three more  dark elf captives.  Mordare looked to Jazpha.  A single tear rolled down her left cheek.  He could tell from the look in her eyes that she would like nothing more than to spit in the face of their captors, but she didn't dare do that.
<br><br>
	Then, the wizard spoke.  "Now, now," he said.  "Let him have a few words.  After all, they will be his last."  Despite his slight frame, the wizard was very imposing and was obviously the leader of this party.
<br><br>
	In the background, Mordare could hear whisperings of a good hunt, but he ignored them and replied directly to the wizard.  "But sir, we have done nothing; I am merely an enchanter, and Jazpha...she is merely a healer.  We've never even seen real combat."
<br><br>
	"You have done nothing... YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING!?" boomed the wizard in disbelief.  "Your kind have killed hundreds upon hundreds of our kind.  You practice necromancy and defile our dead.  You teach your children hate and lies.  Yet, you have the audacity to claim that you have done NOTHING!?  You fool!  Your people killed my daughter; she was little more than a baby, and they killed her!  Now you must pay the price!"
<br><br>
	The wizard's voice was a mixture of hatred and sorrow, but Mordare had to reply.  "No!  How can you condemn me for the crimes of others?  I have done none of the things you speak of!  Today is the first time I have even seen a high elf!"
<br><br>
	"Aye, but you will...they all do, eventually.  It is time friends.  I am sorry young one, but last week your kind killed several high elves.  There must be vengeance."  With this the wizard receded backwards and the others moved in.
<br><br>
	"Gods forgive me," muttered the wizard.  "Kill them...kill them all, except him.  Leave him.  Let him tell the Teir'dal what happens when you mess with the high elves of Felwithe."
<br><br>
	Just then, Jazpha spat in the face of one of the high elf paladins; she was promptly sent backwards with a backhand.  Seeing this, Mordare pointed to Jazpha and cried "No!  Spare her!  Spare her and take me!"
<br><br>
	"Shut up you worthless piece of filth!" shouted a cleric.  Mordare then went down with a thud.  A sharp pain shot through his neck to his spine.  Then, barely, just barely, Mordare heard Jazpha scream his name one last time before he was engulfed in an all-consuming nothingness.
<br><br>
	Mordare awoke with a sharp pain in his chest.  Every breath he took was pure agony.  His eyes were swollen shut.  His head was pounding, and his neck was sore.  It seemed like he hurt all over.  He could feel the dried blood caked on his face.  He had been beaten badly, but he was alive.  Then without warning all of the pain disappeared.  He forced his eyes open, searching frantically for any sign of Jazpha.  Then he found her.  Despite his condition he forced his way over to her body.  She had been stabbed and beaten badly, but Mordare still thought she was the most beautiful creature in all of Norrath.
<br><br>
	"Please Innoruuk," he prayed. "I will show you the greatest hate ever.  I have been your devoted servant; you cannot fail me now."
<br><br>
	He reached for Jazpha despite the obvious.  Then, all hope died.  Mordare felt her dark ebony skin, and it was cold and without life.  Mordare began to sob hysterically until finally his sorrow changed to hate and anger.  "NOOOOOOOOO!  Innoruuk, bring her back!  Bring her back now!" but there was no response.
<br><br>
	"DAMN YOU INNORUUK, AND DAMN THE HIGH ELVES! DAMN THEM ALL!" half-crying, Mordare forced the words into a powerful cry for all of Norrath to hear.
<br><br>
	Then Mordare gathered himself.  Ignoring the pain, he gently picked up Jazpha's lifeless shell, and he began the long slow walk back to Neriak.
<br><br>
	As he neared the entrance, Vordraz and several others greeted him.  He told them what had happened and shouted at the top of his lungs, "Vengeance!  Who goes with me to slaughter the high elf bastards?"
<br><br>
	But his friend, Vordraz, calmly replied, "You are in no condition for battle my friend.  Even if you were, a direct confrontation in their own homeland would be suicide.  No, we must wait for the perfect moment.  Only then do we strike."
<br><br>
	"But Vordraz, they killed Jazpha," pleaded Mordare.
<br><br>
	"I know my friend... I know, but you can't doom our race to bring back the dead."
<br><br>
	Disgusted Mordare spoke, "Cowards... all of you."
<br><br>
	Then Vordraz spoke once again, "No Mordare, rest.  Regain your strength and perfect your magicks.  Then one day, when the time is right, you shall march with us against the high elves."
<br><br>
	"Bah!  What good was my enchantment today?  None.  No, I will find another way.  Vordraz, I thought that you would understand.  I have believed in Innoruuk all my life, and today he could not help me, and neither can you old friend.  I have only one last favor to ask of you friend."
<br><br>
	"Anything my friend.  I only wish that you would understand," replied Vordraz calmly.
<br><br>
	"Take me to Oggok.  I hear they discourage cowards there," snapped Mordare.
<br><br>
	Although the words stung, Vordraz would not be shaken and replied once again, "As you wish, my friend."
<br><br>
	So that night, the village healers took care of Mordare as best they could, and the next day, escorted by Vordraz, he left out for Oggok, the city of ogres, where he stayed for several years.  He stayed there and learned the basics of the black art of necromancy.  Some say he even managed to befriend a young ogre while there.  Try as he might, however, he could not learn any more; he needed the help of a master.  So, after years, he contacted Vordraz and told him that he was ready to once again return home...
<br><br>

	"You know kind sir, that I still hear stories of him from time to time.  His whole life has become a never-ending quest for vengeance.  He wanders the land seeking mastery over death, and the destruction of the high elves, and with each passing day he becomes more and more evil," said Shandar to the barkeep.
<br><br>
	As the Bard finished his story, he looked at the empty glass and asked the bartender about the drink.
<br><br>
	"Aye, ye can have it, but don't ye be makin' a habit o' this."
<br><br>
	And with that, the young bard left the tavern, sincerely hoping to return one day soon.
