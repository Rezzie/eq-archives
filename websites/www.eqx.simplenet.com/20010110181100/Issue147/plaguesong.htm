  <p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prologue</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma idly toyed 
    with his empty mug. Age-old rings of purplish wine from the bottom of mugs 
    made haphazard designs on the scarred oak tabletop. The tavern was quiet, 
    and the muted sounds of those who had decided to stay in the common room and 
    were settling down for a night&#146;s rest made a murmuring backdrop to his 
    thoughts. Oghma carefully rolled the bottom of his mug around the rings, making 
    it travel forward and back, and side to side, all without lifting the mug 
    or have the edge stray from a ring. With an odd, yet deep satisfaction at 
    a job well done he put the mug down on a circle in front of him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Yet another 
    tavern table circumscribed by drink,&#148; he thought. Somewhere in that thought 
    was an idea, or a song, or even an ironic metaphor, but he was too tired to 
    push his creativity to find it. He had ridden a borrowed pony all the way 
    from Two Ford to reach this small village. Five Oaks was deep in the Gnarley 
    Forest, a village of about one hundred farmers, hunters, and the odd craftsman 
    - not the large, urban centers he was used to frequenting. Sometime tonight 
    someone was supposed to contact him, and tell him news of yet another village, 
    Skorane, which, decimated by plague a decade ago, had suddenly become newsworthy 
    again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He hated riding 
    ponies. It was not far below sea voyages on his list of bad ways to get from 
    one place to another - his backside ached, his legs felt stretchy-soft and 
    leaden, and he was unable to rid his nose of the smell of horse.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Oghma, 
    another round? Semaj and Pilfer have already hit the sack.&#148;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tiredly Oghma 
    looked over at his friend Elec. The tall, slim elf was looking at him with 
    a grin that contained about equal parts compassion and mischief. Elec had 
    ridden along side him from Two Ford, but he was much more used to the saddle, 
    and Oghma&#146;s obvious discomfort was giving him no end of mirthful satisfaction. 
    How like an elf! Oghma hoped that someday they&#146;d find themselves in a 
    nice dwarf city, with ceilings as tall as the crown of Elec&#146;s head, and 
    doorsills with endless forehead-smashing opportunities. Oghma smiled at the 
    thought.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I think 
    this one is your turn,&#148; Oghma said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elec nodded, 
    and retrieved the pitcher of red wine he&#146;d concealed behind him. &#147;I 
    thought you&#146;d be ready,&#148; he grinned.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;So, Semaj 
    and Pilfer are horse-waddling too?&#148; Oghma chuckled. If it wasn&#146;t 
    for his tough dwarven constitution, he may have been stretched out next to 
    the two humans. It had been a long, hard ride, and Elec was the only one who&#146;d 
    ridden lately. As it was he was very sore, but not as tired as he might have 
    been. He looked over at Semaj and Pilfer settling down for the night and raised 
    his mug to their sleepy wave.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Semaj just 
    quietly lay down, but Pilfer was full of querulous complaints,&#148; Elec 
    smiled. &#145;Why did we have to do this anyway?&#146; &#145;Who is it we 
    are supposed to meet?&#146; &#145;Couldn&#146;t we have taken a couple days 
    to get here?&#146;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elec sat down 
    and filled both their mugs, frowning. &#147;Anyone look your way, give you 
    a nod, anything?&#148; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma shook his 
    head. &#147;Not yet.&#148; Oghma said, &#147;I&#146;m about ready to call 
    it a night, though I think I&#146;ll ask the innkeeper if he&#146;s got a 
    room with a bed. I&#146;m not sure I can sleep on the common room floor tonight. 
    Semaj and Pilfer are comfortable there, but I think I could use the extra 
    padding.&#148; Oghma winced.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elec nodded. 
    They sat in silence a while, two friends who, though they came from wildly 
    differing backgrounds, were able to fill a silence together without discomfort. 
    Semaj and Pilfer were friends of theirs also, though these two humans felt 
    more comfortable in each other&#146;s company, as Oghma and Elec did with 
    each other. Oghma and Elec were the &#147;strangers&#148; in Five Oaks, as 
    dwarves and, to a lesser extent elves were uncommon even in this part of the 
    Gnarley Forest, which probably explained their initial friendship. Semaj and 
    Pilfer rounded out their group, but they had been in Five Oaks already, preparing 
    a house for the four adventurers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma turned 
    to his right and removed the oilskin cover from his harp, which he had rested 
    on the bench next to him. &#147;Perhaps I still have a little left in me for 
    a lullaby.&#148;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma struck 
    a few chords to check the tuning on his harp. He winked at Elec as he turned 
    a few pegs to get his harp in tune. &#147;Let&#146;s see if this innkeeper 
    favors us entertainers.&#148;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He began to softly 
    play, his fingers a bit stiff and tentative at first, then warming up to his 
    task. The soft notes of an old lullaby gradually increased in volume until 
    it was a gentle undercurrent in the room. Common room sleepers quieted down 
    to listen and the talking became a low murmur. Instead of singing the lyrics, 
    Oghma hummed along, using his deep bass resonance to calm and soothe his listeners. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elec relaxed 
    back into the booth and poured another mug of the red wine. He had been raised 
    in an elvish village, full of laughter, gaiety, and singing. Elvish music 
    was light, soft, like rain falling on leaves, or birdsong. He had never even 
    suspected there could be dwarven bards, thinking them too serious, too full 
    of the craftsman&#146;s ethic and the love of battle to be skilled in song. 
    The few months he had known Oghma had shown him a new appreciation of dwarves, 
    their dry humor, their deep love of stone and metal. Oghma&#146;s music was, 
    admittedly, sometimes ponderous - but there was a strength of purpose like 
    the deep sighs of mountains which moved the listener like nothing he had ever 
    heard before.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma began a 
    second lullaby, this one a tune Elec had heard as child. Elec looked over 
    at Oghma in surprise and saw him grinning. The music cascaded from Oghma&#146;s 
    fingertips, the lighter elvish melody slowed and deepened, with dwarven harmonics 
    thrown over the melody. The music seemed more soothing and at the same time 
    sadder, as if it was taking the sprightly melody and turning it into a more 
    meaningful sort of dance. It fit Elec&#146;s mood almost exactly. Elec smiled 
    in acknowledgement and shook his head as if to clear his thoughts when the 
    song ended.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma waved to 
    the innkeeper as he walked by with some spare blankets. &#147;Do you have 
    a spare room upstairs for a tired bard?&#148; Oghma smiled and struck a playful 
    chord.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The innkeeper 
    smiled and reached his hand from the pile of blankets. &#147;Rhenn, at your 
    service,&#148; he said tiredly. &#147;I do have a spare room. Would you honor 
    me and stay a few nights? You&#146;ll get the room free with meals for some 
    entertainment for my patrons?&#148; His sentence ended on a questioning note, 
    and Oghma smiled and nodded in response.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I&#146;ll 
    play a little longer, quietly, then head upstairs,&#148; Oghma said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Third door 
    on the right,&#148; said Rhenn, and walked off with the blankets to distribute 
    them to the common room patrons.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After a few more 
    songs Oghma nodded at Elec. Elec sketched a wave with a yawn and went to sit 
    down next to Semaj and Pilfer. Oghma headed up the stairs and was asleep as 
    soon as he had taken off his boots.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Chapter 
    1</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma awoke suddenly. 
    With a sudden sense of apprehension, he quietly rolled off the right side 
    of the bed. Looking into the unlit room with his darkvision he could see that 
    the window, closed when he entered the room, was now open. Creeping around 
    the bed to get a clearer look at the room, he could see a huddled form below 
    the windowsill.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Who are 
    you?&#148; he whispered. &#147;What do you want?&#148; There was no reply. 
    Oghma moved carefully toward the figure, which he could see was a human male 
    of middle age. As he came closer he realized the man wasn&#146;t reacting, 
    wasn&#146;t even&#133; breathing. He rushed to the window to look outside, 
    and saw a figure running towards the tree line, already about two hundred 
    yards away and moving quickly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Damn!&#148; 
    Oghma cursed. If he were fleet of foot like Elec, or had Elec&#146;s skill 
    with a bow, perhaps he could chase down the figure. He looked down at the 
    man and saw that he&#146;d had a dagger shoved through his back and had been 
    leaned up or had fallen against the wall below the window.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma set himself 
    to seeing if he could bind the man&#146;s wounds, but it was quickly apparent 
    that although strongly built and hardy, the man had suffered a mortal wound.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma quickly 
    went to the door and listened. Hearing no one, he crept quietly down the darkened 
    hall of the slumbering inn. Arriving at the foot of the stairs, he looked 
    across the common room. In the flickering light of a single oil lamp, he saw 
    that his nearest companion, Pilfer, was about four sleeping bodies away, across 
    the floor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Carefully tiptoeing 
    over the sleeping travelers, he shook Pilfer&#146;s shoulder and, when he 
    woke, made shushing gestures and pointed to the other two sleeping friends. 
    &#147;Bring them upstairs,&#148; Oghma breathed quietly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pilfer nodded 
    and gathered himself together. Oghma tiptoed back across the sleeping people 
    and waited for Pilfer to wake Elec and Semaj and waved them upstairs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When in the room, 
    Oghma told the group what had happened and Elec, a cleric of Fharlanghn, god 
    of wanderers, checked the man&#146;s body.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Looks like 
    he didn&#146;t even see it coming,&#148; said Elec softly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pilfer&#146;s 
    eyes glanced from side to side nervously, and his feet began the quick tap-dance 
    of imminent flight. &#147;We didn&#146;t do it! We need to get rid of the 
    body fast so we don&#146;t get caught!&#148;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Semaj grunted. 
    &#147;Relax, Pilf - running away will make us look guilty. Besides, we don&#146;t 
    know who he is or why he&#146;s here.&#148;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pilfer began 
    to rummage through the dead man&#146;s clothing, checking pockets and pouches. 
    After finding assorted coins and a nice-looking dagger, he pulled out a crumpled 
    note from an inside pocket.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Leralth 
    - the Staff of Incabulos - Skorane&#148;, he read aloud.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Incabulos? 
    God of disease?&#148; Elec shuddered. &#147;I don&#146;t know what the staff 
    does, but it sounds pretty bad.&#148;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma nodded. 
    &#147;There is an old legend about the staff of Incabulos, but it doesn&#146;t 
    have a lot of detail. It was created in the Greyhawk Wars, at a point when 
    his clergy was at it&#146;s strongest. Supposedly it contains rot that actually 
    dropped from the god&#146;s body when the High Priest summoned him. The clergy 
    was defeated later in the Battle of Garnor Ford and no one knows what happened 
    to the staff after that.&#148;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;So what 
    does it do?&#148; Semaj asked.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elec shrugged 
    worriedly. &#147;No one really knows, but any item consecrated to Incabulos 
    would deal with increasing his power on Oerth. Since Incabulos is god of disease, 
    it could be anything from a simple staff that causes disease with a touch 
    or that can control disease causing undead to something more insidious, like 
    something that can increase incidence of disease over a large area, like a 
    city.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Even worse, 
    it could do all of that. Cause disease, create and control diseased undead, 
    and create a large area where disease overwhelms the population&#146;s capacity 
    to deal with it. Once that happens, disease would spread quickly throughout 
    the city. Enough disease in an area like that could create a nexus point to 
    bring Incabulos to Oerth.&#148;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The thought of 
    such a horrible artifact loose momentarily left the party without words.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma was the 
    first to break the silence. &#147;Look, I&#146;m going down to rouse the Rhenn 
    the innkeeper, so this gets taken care of before the village awakens. Hopefully 
    he&#146;ll believe me when I say we had nothing to do with his death. Maybe 
    he&#146;ll be able to tell us who this dead man is, too.&#148;</font></p>
