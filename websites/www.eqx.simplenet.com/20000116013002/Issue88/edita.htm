Imagine spending all of your spare time working a second job.  Picture using a headset for your phone so that you can do dishes and handle customers or fellow employee questions.  Picture taking a vacation from your first job so that you can make a business trip for your second job.  Imagine living a life where you are scraping together every spar moment of your life just to meet deadlines for this extra job.
<br><br>
And imagine not getting paid for it.
<br><br>
Yup, I'm completely insane, you guys already knew that.  But I'm not as insane as the Elder Guides for EverQuest.  While I only dream up these silly scenarios, they live them.  These folks work harder at EverQuest then I do at the job that pays me (all right, that's not saying much…).  I had the pleasure of meeting with four of them over the weekend.  It seems that they had a meeting in San Diego with the Verant folks, and I don't live all that far from San Diego.  So I grabbed Arc by the scruff of his neck and dragged him with me.
<br><br>
First off let me tell you that they turned away any questions about anything really interesting, like 'LET US SEE THE NEW EXPANSION!  NOW!', so there won't be any spoilers this week.  Heck, they wouldn't even spill any of the interesting quotes from their time with Verant.  They claimed to have forgotten all the good ones…  teases that they were.  And I wasn't there long enough to sneak into their hotel rooms and copy information off of their laptops.  That… and I couldn't rely on Arc to keep them busy while I try to crawl through this bathroom window.  It's more likely that he'd wait until I was halfway in and then tie something heavy to my feet and close the window on me.
<br><br>
But I was able to get a better understanding of what it is that they go through while working for Verant for free.  For example; I haven't even had my ICQ on at all, except for a few hours last week, in maybe two months.  It's bothersome to me to try to write or read or surf for porn when that little message thing is flashing.  Years of working in an office have me trained like one of Pavlov's dogs, and I get nervous when I don't answer it.  Don't get me wrong, I actually have enjoyed most of the conversations I have on ICQ.  I just prefer the chance to put off answering (like e-mail and voice messages) for as long as I need to think up something witty to say.  With ICQ if you're on, they know it.  I just can't take the pressure.
<br><br>
Well if one of these guides goes off ICQ for a day, or even a few hours, alarms go off.  Everyone that is anyone in the EQ world panics.  They get a dozen phone calls, tons of e-mails, the National Guard is called out and the nation goes to DefCon 3.  And I'm only exaggerating a little bit.  The Elder Guides are the security blanket for the hundreds of guides, and they are the first point of contact for the staff at Verant.  I got the impression that all four of these folks spend every waking moment thinking and doing guide work for Verant, literally.  One of them related having found an elaborate way to use three keyboards at the same time…
<br><br>
Despite their obvious exhaustion from a week of ironing out guide and game details with Verant and with each other, they were all very friendly and very enthusiastic about EverQuest and where it's headed.  They hinted at increased dynamic quests.  They were blank-faced when I made suggestions about how to better implement GM and guide run quests, and about my suggested improvements in general.  It wasn't until the drive home that night that it occurred to me that they were probably tired of talking about that stuff, and that my ideas were probably nothing new to them.  The blank face approach was probably best, a sort of 'we can neither confirm nor deny' stance, one that a smarter person than me would have picked up on right away… sorry 'bout that.
<br><br>
They were even nice enough to say that, if they had the time, they would read EQX.
<br><br>
Oddly enough, most of our conversation ended up being a sort of reminiscing.  You know, telling tales about what it was like to first see Norrath, talking about the first time you saw the bridges in Karana, stuff like that.  I was a bit surprised, really.  These guides have been there since the beginning, early beta.  They've logged a bazillion hours testing and helping other players and guides.  And they still smile and laugh when talking about the game or about Norrath.  Some of them get so little time to actually play that their highest level characters are 5th or 7th level.  That's dedicated!
<br><br>
They also mentioned something else that I found amazing.  They told me that for the entire time that they were there they witnessed GMs working for twelve or thirteen hours a day.  They were putting in a lot of overtime every day trying to keep up with the needs of thousands of us needy players.  And they seemed happy to do it.  Another great, dedicated bunch of people.
<br><br>
I'm dedicating this editorial to these hard working guides, and all those like them.  I'm hoping that everyone realizes what these people give up to help you out.  I want Verant to know that it's true, you couldn't afford these people if you had to pay them what they are worth to you.  And to the players, you don't know how lucky you are to have them.  They organize herds (I guess that's one way of putting it) of guides for you.  They are fighting for your rights as much as they are for their own.  They want this game to be fun for all of us, and they expend all of their free time to make it so.  And to you regular ol' guides out there, don't forget them.  When they ask you to send in a report, please do so on time.  When they teach you the way to handle the customer, please listen.  These folks are very smart and they've been at it a long time.  We all owe them as much respect and praise as we can find it in our hearts to muster.
