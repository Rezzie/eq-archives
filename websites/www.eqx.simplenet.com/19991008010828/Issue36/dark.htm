Trynlor landed quietly on the rooftop. He was up and running the moment his feet touched the roof. He ran to the edge of the building and leapt onto the roof of the neighboring building, his thick black cloak fluttered behind him as he flew threw the air. It was long past midnight, and those that were out were either guards or drunks who couldn't find their way back to their homes. Trynlor paid little attention to any of them. He was on a mission, 4,000 platinum were riding on Trynlor's success tonight. His destination was the lone tower that stood out in the night sky. A young mage resided there. He was becoming very powerful, and many in neighboring cities wanted the threat eliminated before he could do any damage.
<br><br>
Trynlor was a hired dagger in the backs of those who others wanted dead. The cloak Trynlor wore hid many devices that would bring certain death to those unsuspecting. The cloak itself was magical. Any spell that is cast at the wearer is absorbed into the cloak. The magical energy is converted to healing energy and then past onto the wearer, at the wearers will, renewing their strength and healing any wounds. Though, that all depends on the power of the spell.
<br><br>
Trynlor was nearing the tower now. There came a loud crack as a rotting wooden shingle snapped as he landed on it. His knee buckled awkwardly as he landed. Trynlor kept in a yelp of pain. The broken pieces tumbled down the roof and clattered on the cobble stone street below. This caught the attention of a passing guard, which brought him running over. Trynlor scrambled up the roof and dextrally jumped over the opposite side of the roof, away from the street.
<br><br>
"Hello? Who's up there?" the guard called out, unsheathing his sword. The guard squinted into the darkness, trying to see anything that broke the shingle. "Hmm, must have been a cat. Ah well" the guard said disappointedly, sheathing his sword again. The guard mustn't have seen a lot of action lately, and was hoping for anything, even if he had to fight with the cat for some action.
<br><br>
The guard continued on his way, and so did Trynlor.
<br><br>
Trynlor now came to the last building nearest the tower. Trynlor leapt onto the outer wall surrounding the tower. Trynlor climbed down and walked over to the main tower. He visibly limped as he walked.
<br><br>
He came to the tower and stopped. The walls of the tower were sheer up to about 100 feet, there were no hand holds. Trynlor reached behind him and pulled a grappling hook from his belt. The three hooks were folded down at the sides.  He pulled each one up to his desired position, each hook being kept up by a spring and clasp. The ends of each hook were padded with cloth so they would not make a sound when they hit their objective.
<br><br>
Trynlor stepped back from the tower and began swinging the grapple. He looked up, trying to judge the height, then let the grapple fly. The top end of the grapple was weighted and it easily flew the distance. It landed quietly on a windowsill. Trynlor gingerly pulled on the rope until the grapple came to the edge of the sill. Then, with expertise born of years of experience, Trynlor gave the rope a yank, bringing one of the grapple hooks into the sill. He pulled harder until the hook ripped though the cloth and began chipping at the sill.
<br><br>
	Trynlor made sure it was secure then began climbing hand over hand until he came to the sill. He peaked into the window. It wasn't the room he was looking for. He then pulled himself up onto the sill and began looking around. He saw what he was looking for, a statue of a dragons head poked out of the side of the tower, around twenty feet above and to the left.
	<br><br>
Trynlor had studied the architectural plans of the tower his contracts had provided him with, and he knew almost every detail of this tower. He also knew that the mage would most likely be in his private study right now. Trynlor was on the right level just the wrong side.
<br><br>
Trynlor bent and picked up his grappling hook and got a good grip on the end of the rope. His other hand took the rope several feet from the head of the grappling and began swinging it. He let it loose and the grappling hook went straight up and came down in a wide arch, Trynlor pulled the rope tight just as it passed the statue on the other side, causing it too swing around and hook onto the dragons head.
<br><br>
Trynlor grabbed onto the rope with both his hands and jumped, raising his feet. He swung off the ledge and halfway around the tower. He came up to the opposite window and caught the sill with his foot. He pulled himself up then reached into a pouch and took out a square piece of metal. He placed the metal on top of the rope to keep it from swinging back.
<br><br>
Trynlor now looked in the window and found what he pursued. In the room, a young man sat at a luxurious oak desk scribing into a book. The man put down the pen, paused for a moment reviewing what he had just written then stood up and left the room. Trynlor pushed open the window and slipped inside. He then shut the window and went into a dark corner, which was beside a curtained bed. Just as he did so the man came back and sat at the desk again.
<br><br>
Trynlor waited and few moments before he stood, quietly unsheathing his poisoned dagger, and crept towards the man. Just as Trynlor was half way to him, the man stood up and turned to leave again but stopped as he saw Trynlor.
<br><br>
Just then a man wearing a bronze breastplate stepped through the door. "I just received…What in the…?" the man stopped abruptly as he noticed Trynlor as well. Trynlor silently cursed his bad luck as he tried to assess the situation. Trynlor's attention was fully on the mage, so he only knew by sound that the newcomer had unsheathed his sword. The mage then spoke out.
<br><br>
	"I knew they'd send an assassin after me eventually. Oh well. I guess you won't be getting your bounty." He then looked over to the newcomer, "Do not worry, this situation is well under control." The man with the sword relaxed visibly as the mage then began the workings of a spell. A sneer crossed the mages face as fire began to dance in his hands, it grew larger and larger. Trynlor did not flinch, knowing full well that he could protect himself with his cloak. And he did just that. As the mage let loose his fireball, Trynlor pulled his cloak up over his head and turned his back towards the incoming spell. The fireball dissipated into a puff of smoke as it was absorbed into his cloak. The mage stood with his mouth gapping open as Trynlor used part of the energy to heal his knee then threw the rest of the energy at the mage in its original form, he also sent his dagger right behind the fireball. The mage quickly cast a dispel magic at the fireball and it disappeared entirely, though he hadn't not notice the dagger. It sunk into his shoulder and the mage fell to the ground writhing in agony as the poison pumped through his body, slowly shutting down his organs, then he was dead.
	<br><br>
The soldier hadn't moved an inch through all this, surprised by the turn of events and the sudden death of his master. Trynlor did not waste a second, he pulled his cutlass from its sheath and ran over to the soldier with a downward chop. The soldier brought his sword up in time to block it. Trynlor pulled his cutlass back and pretended to try and cut lower though quickly reversed it and went high again. The soldier saw this and was able to block it again. Trynlor saw he was fighting somebody with experience and he quickly pulled out his dirk. Trynlor blocked the swings the soldier threw at him with his dirk while his cutlass fought for an opening. Trynlor then went for an overhead chop with his cutlass and swung his dirk aimed at the soldier's armpit. The soldier didn't have a chance. The soldier went high to block his cutlass, though Trynlor's dirk stabbed into the soldier's armpit of his sword arm. The soldier's sword fell to the ground and Trynlor quickly kicked it away. Trynlor then kicked the man's legs out beneath him. He grabbed the man's arm and lifted it up, he then slipped his blade into his armpit and into his heart. The man's body then went limp. Trynlor retrieved his dirk and cleaned the blood of with a cloth from his pocket. 
<br><br>	
	He then pulled out a small metal vial from one of his many pockets. He uncorked it and poured a few of its contents onto each of the armpit wounds and the wounds closed up and all blood disappeared. He then pulled out a thread and needle from another pocket and sewed up the torn holes in the man's tunic. He dragged him near the bed and dropped him there. Trynlor walked over to the mage, retrieved his dagger and did the same with this mans wounds and shirt. He then picked up the mage and placed him under the covers of his bed. After he did that he went over to the soldier and removed his breastplate and boots as well as his tunic and pants. He placed the man in the bed beside the mage and did the same with the mages clothes. He took the clothes and armor and strew them about the room. He closed the book on the mages desk and replaced the pen in the inkwell. He walked over to the mage then and took a ring that sat upon one of his fingers, he slipped the ring into one of his pockets. He then blew out the lamp and walked over to the window, where he stepped out into the night.
