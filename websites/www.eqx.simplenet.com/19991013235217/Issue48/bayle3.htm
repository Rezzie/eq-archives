In what has to be the most beautiful city in all of Norrath, she sat. Surly, unkempt, and sour of mood, she sat on the catwalk, her feet dangling over the edge.  Over a hundred feet below, the forest floor spread out beneath her, but she cared not.  Instead, her attention was inward, her mind full of worry and concern and, though she would never admit it to anyone... fear.
<br><br>
"I do not know what he sees in you" stated a voice immediately behind her.
<br><br>
Growling low in her throat, she whipped around, sword at the ready, prepared to gut anyone that would bother her now.  Her eyes met those of the wizard behind her and she somewhat relaxed her posture, though did not put her sword away.  "What do you want, wizard?"
<br><br>
"Why, only to check up on you and see that you are doing well.  You are pivotal in the events in the world right now and it would not do for you to come to an early demise."  The wizard stepped forward and carefully picked a branch out of the half-elf's short cropped hair.
<br><br>
Winter slapped his hand away, glaring up into his eyes "Pivotal to what? Why?  This is nonsense.  I'm no one of import.  Why must I stay here?"
<br><br>
"Because it's safer.  Vashaar has no foothold on Faydwer... yet.  His power is weakest here, so here you stay until we understand more about his intentions.  However, what little I can glean from the texts and prophecies is not good, I'm afraid."  Ozymandius continued to pick leaves and twigs from her hair and armor and she continued to bat his hands away.  "You know, you would be a very lovely young lady, if you simply took a bath, brushed your hair, and perhaps wore nicer clothing.  I should fetch you a gown."
<br><br>
The sound that issued from her throat was not one normally heard from a person, but more often from a wolf or large cat.  The wizard raised his hands in mock surrender, taking a step back and smiling innocently.  "I'm just trying to help.  You are in dire straights and I thought all women enjoyed getting new things when they were upset."  Ozymandius knew he should not be baiting her, but it was so easy and quite amusing.  Besides, given all she was going through, she needed an enemy she could see and fight.
<br><br>
The string of expletives that Winter spat at him were most certainly in Elven, though in all his years he was not aware that such brutal concepts could be conveyed using such a graceful language.   Nor did he believe he was capable of assuming the positions she was indicating, especially with the domestic animals she suggested.
<br><br>
Ozymandius chuckled and shook his head "Ok, Ok, I surrender.  I'll stop trying to civilize you.  I'd sooner cage a beast of the wild then strap you into a bustle."
<br><br>
"What prophesy?  What have you found?"  Winter returned to her seat on the catwalk, though with only one leg dangling off, the other tucked beneath her as she regarded the Erudite with pale blue eyes colder than her namesake, her face set like ice.
<br><br>
"You will not like it." He intoned, then nodded in response to her glare.  "Very well.  From the texts I have been able to dig up...no easy task, I must say... I found the following passage in the scriptures of Innoruuk, 'When My favored child chooses his bride, the new age shall begin.  In this age, the Loathsome Age, the favored shall spread Hate across the land, bringing chaos where there is order, and order where chaos reigns.  And the bride shall be brought, and broken, and branded with the mark of the Prince, and shall live her life loathing the thing that she has become in the purest form of Hate... the Hate of self.  On that day, Norrath shall be Mine.'"  Ozymandius paused, watching the color drain from Winter's normally pale skin.  "Keep in mind, the scriptures are the rantings of a mad God, so not much credence can be given to them.  But... Vashaar seems to have a more-than-passing interest in you, such that he is willing to kill by the thousand to get at you.  So, whether they are true or not, he believes them to be and that is all he needs."
<br><br>
For the first time since he met her, Winter's composure eroded slightly, and he could see the fear that lie beneath.  Not wishing to injure her pride, he said nothing of it, but knowing it existed simply firmed his resolve to keep this young lady alive and safe.
<br><br>
Then it was gone, and all light faded from her eyes, leaving only a cold resolve to not be taken... by anyone.  "What do I do?"
<br><br>
Ozymandius nodded.  "We wait.  We watch.  We gather information and we make sure we know what is going on where.  That is all we can do.  Vashaar holds all the cards at this point, and all we can do is see how he chooses to play them."  The wizard paused, "And you be careful.  I know you long to hunt and to run.  To feel the wind in your face the grass against your skin.  But being alone is the last thing that you need right now.  Alone he can come to you, and you are not strong enough to resist him alone.  No mortal is."
<br><br>
Winter dropped her head and closed her eyes, nodding dejectedly.  This was her home, though she rarely spent time here.  The wood elves marginally accepted her, if only through deeds and not birth.  The Rangers here were of a different breed as well.  Prouder, stronger, and from a long line of Rangers, leading back into the centuries.  She glanced out into the woods, her true home, and sighed.  That is where she belonged, where she felt at peace...and where "He" waits to take her.  Every bone in her body cried out to run out there and face him to get this over with, feeling she could resist him for she felt no one could take her against her will.
<br><br>
But she knew better.  The wizard was right, damn him.  Alone, he would have his way and she would be lost.  Winter shuddered at the thought.  Then she glanced up at the Erudite standing over her.  He was not smiling, which was good.  He just stood there, his gaze unreadable.
<br><br>
She sighed.  "I shall stay."
<br><br>
"You promise?  I can assign someone to stay with you and watch over you if you feel you can not stay.  I can not control you, nor would I try.  That is not my way.  But you are too important to allow your selfish instincts to take over.  You must stay in the arms of Tunare, as he dare not come here alone."  Ozymandius reached down and gently stroked her hair comfortingly.
<br><br>
Winter tolerated the touch, knowing it comforted him though it annoyed her.  Then she stood and brushed herself off.  "I shall be all right, and shall not leave.  I promise.  Do not 'assign' anyone to me."
<br><br>
Ozymandius regarded her levelly, then nodded.  "Very well.  I must return to Qeynos.  I've a promise to keep.  Be well and stay safe.  I shall return to you."  With that, the wizard invoked his magic and vanished in a glowing globe.
<br><br>
Winter turned and walked up the catwalk.  As she passed by, the Elves greeted her noncommittally.  Not hostile, not welcome, just there.  Winter sighed and made her way to her lodge.  She was staying in the lodge of a friend of Ozymandius.  An Elven Ranger named Maclir, that was out on an errand for the wizard and his home sat empty.
<br><br>
She walked into the small lodge and once again noted it's spartan furnishings.  "He never sleeps here" she mumbled to herself, realizing that he may spend but a few moments here every month or so at the most.  The bed coverings were not only made and tucked when she arrived, but dusty as well.  She had yet to meet this Maclir, and doubted she wanted too if he was anything like the other Rangers here.
<br><br>
She sat on the edge of the bed and put her head into her hands.  Sleeping was out of the question... the dreams would come.  She hated the dreams.  The beautiful, ebon-skinned figure that came to her and tried to lure her soul away.  Preying upon her hate of him, feeding it.
<br><br>
She shuddered and stood up.  "Enough" she stated to no one in particular.
<br><br>
She grabbed her swords and bow and headed for the door.  She needed to run.  Not far, but she needed to run.
<br><br>
She strode out the door, across the platform, and down the catwalk.  Shinnying down the tree she found herself on the forest floor.  Picking a direction at random, she took off with a distance eating stride, Kelethin falling far behind.  Immediately, she felt better.  She stopped and took a deep breath, feeling her soul heal by leaps and she felt the animal within her awaken.  She crouched low and began scanning the ground, looking for traces of prey.
<br><br>
As she moved about, she crossed a trail and stopped, studying the ground intently.  Orc tracks.  Footmen by the look of it.  Winter's pulse surged as she felt the rush of blood lust at the thought of her enemy.  "Just what I needed" she muttered and took off following the tracks, staying low to the ground.
<br><br>
Soon her keen hearing picked up the guttural sounds of the Orc language ahead of her.  She slowed down and became one with the foliage, moving silently forward.  Soon she could see them, three of them, standing in a circle and talking.  She could not understand what they were saying, but they appeared to be nervous as they kept glancing about.  Rightfully so, as these were Elven woods and Orcs were not particularly welcome here.
<br><br>
Silently she sheathed her sword, pulled her bow, and nocked an arrow.  Drawing the string and sighting down the shaft, she took deep breath, held it, and released.  The look of surprise on the Footman's face was appropriate as his forehead sprouted a feathered shaft.  He toppled backwards into the grass as the other two turned to see the source of the arrow, rage showing clear on their faces.
<br><br>
Winter leapt from her cover, drawing her blades and charging down upon the remaining two, savage glee shining in her crystal eyes.  One of the Orcs drew a vicious looking axe and charged to meet her while the other turned and ran.  Winter cursed the coward, blocked the downward swinging axe, and impaled the Footman with her longsword, continuing her forward momentum with a spin, almost dancing her way past the Orc who was dead but not yet aware of it.  She then turned and ran after the fleeing Orc.
<br><br>
He was rushing head long through the foliage, not making any efforts to conceal his passage, so following him was not a problem.  Slowly she gained upon him, then saw him stop and turn, but not draw a weapon.  As she closed the distance, she got a sense that something was wrong.  Then she felt the Shaman's magic crawling across her skin, slowing her down.  The grass beneath her feet reached up and pulled at her, tree limbs warping and reaching down to hold her, tearing at her hair and skin.  She screamed in rage and frustration, snarling like a trapped beast.
<br><br>
From the trees, almost a dozen Orcs stepped out, lead by the Shaman.  He was huge, well over 6' tall, and massively muscled.  Around his neck were the dried ears of a dozen elves.  He stepped closer, reaching out and taking Winter's chin in his hand and turned her head to face him.  She snapped at his hand, trying to bite it, but he tightened his grip, near crushing her jaw.
<br><br>
The Shaman smiled ferally, his pointed yellowed teeth and fetid breath inches from her face as he leaned down.  In a guttural violation of the tongue, he spoke in Elvish "The Teir'dal will be most pleased we've captured his prize so easily.  I shall have to raise your price, given how lovely you are."
<br><br>
Winter spit at him but he only wiped it away and laughed.  Then he half-turned to give an order to his men, cried out, and flopped backwards onto the ground, an arrow protruding form the center of his chest.  The other Orcs looked around in terror, not seeing the source of the arrows as another Orc cartwheeled to the ground, an arrow shot completely through his head.
<br><br>
The vines and grasses began relaxing their grip when the Shaman's life fled, and Winter wasted no time in wriggling free, drawing her weapons, and leaping into the fray.  As she cut one down, two more fell to arrows and the Orcs routed, running in all directions, fleeing for their lives.  Winter took one step to follow and heard an unmistakably male voice say "Stop".  He did not shout, but spoke it, yet she heard it as clear as if he were standing next to her.
<br><br>
She turned and saw an Elven Ranger step from the woods, his long bow in his hand, arrow nocked but at rest.  Clad in Elven chain from head to toe, longswords upon his back, and a stern, disapproving expression on his face, he regarded Winter levelly.  Then he gestured with his head and said, "Kelethin is that way."
<br><br>
Winter bit off a retort, chafing at being told what to do, but realizing that this stranger may have saved her soul, if not her life.  She simply nodded and trotted off in the direction indicated.  After a few moments, she stopped and turned around.  She saw no sign of him, but heard behind her, "Yes?"
<br><br>
She spun and faced him, not knowing how the Ranger had gotten ahead of her, nor how he had sneaked up on her, and glared at him.  "Are you following me?"
<br><br>
"Of course not.  I'm leading you.  That way." And the Ranger turned and extended an arm, indicating a direction and that Winter should proceed him.
<br><br>
"Who are you?" she snapped irritably as she stepped past him.
<br><br>
"Maclir.  Ozymandius sent me."
<br><br>
"So you are my 'keeper', is that it?" she grumbled.
<br><br>
"Your watcher, actually.  No one keeps an animal, they simply watch and protect it.  And you, it appears, are in need of protection."  Maclir's voice was low and gravelly, as if he rarely spoke.
<br><br>
When they finally walked beneath the trees of Kelethin, she turned again.
<br><br>
"Will you be needing your house back?  I'm NOT sleeping with you."
<br><br>
He smiled slightly and said, "I think not.  I'll be out here, somewhere.  If you can see me, you can avoid me.  This way, you never know when I'm around. It's easier to watch you that way."  With that, he turned and vanished into the trees.
<br><br>
Winter quietly swore and ascended the tree.  Once atop it, she turned and unceremoniously sunk down onto the catwalk again.  She gazed out into the woods, trying to catch a glimpse of her 'protector', but knew it was pointless as he would only be seen when he wanted too.  Then she sighed, rested her chin in her hands, and muttered, "It's going to be a long night."
