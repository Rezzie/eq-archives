Even though only a quarter of the world is created right now, it still takes
about 45 minutes to travel from Qeynos eastward to the mountain range.  This
gives you a good idea of how enormously huge the world really is, and how 
much time you'll have to spend just to be able to go adventure somewhere.

<b> Magic </b>
<br><br>
There are over 100 spells completed already, with more being added all 
the time.  Every magic class begins with one spell.
<br><BR>
Bard: Hymn of Restoration  (heal self)<BR>
Cleric: Minor Healing <BR>
Druid: Minor Healing <BR>
Enchanter: Shallow Breath <BR>
Magician: Burst of Flame <BR>
Necromancer: Lifetap <BR>
Shaman: Minor Healing <BR>
Wizard: Shock of Frost <BR>

You begin with a scroll of your starting spell.  You then "scribe" it into
your spell book, by simply dragging the scroll to an open slot in your book.
This process currently takes about 45 seconds.  It is then permanently in
your spellbook.  Now you can memorize the spell, which makes it an active
spell you can cast.  You do this by dragging from the spell book to one of
the notches in the left side of your view, as we've seen in some screenshots.
This process takes another 40 seconds.  These times are modified by certain
skills, and they will also be shortened before it is released anyway.  During
the scribing and memorization process, your spellbook covers the screen.  
Brad described this as intentional, explaining you have to concentrate on
learning your spells.  If someone or something attacks you, you will be
told this and it will abort your procedure.

Now you can click on the icon that appears in the notch to cast the spell.
Spells can fizzle or be interrupted if you are attacked, and there is a 
chance you will forget the spell in the middle of combat.  If that happens,
the icon disappears and you have to memorize the spell again.

Other spells that I saw include Quickness, Shield of Fire, Frost Bolt,
Complete Healing, Holy Armor, and Skin Like Wood.
