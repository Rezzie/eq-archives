I really liked <a href="../Issue41/mig.htm">The Grassy Gnoll</a>.  Are there any more tales of Mig Hammerer?  If not, does Archanalia does plan on writing more?  Great story.  Please send my compliments to the author.

<em>Thanks, Sun.
 
It was one of those spur of the moment ideas.  Actually I'd had the play on words "Grassy Gnoll" since a post in the Avault newsgroup Forum.Everquest.  It just came to a head two days before submission deadline when the phrase "Accurate as a dwarven archer" popped into my head.
 
The fun part about writing that one was coming up with a lot of droll similes ("about as cohesive to me as Ogre Poetry").  Essentially, when I get another batch of these I'll write another tale.  Thanks for the kind words!

Just a note to you sir.   I loved your article in issue 41 on "<a href="../Issue41/manners.htm">Mind Your Manners</a>".
If only more of the gamers would treat others with 1/10 of the respect that they would like shown to them...we would all be happy.
