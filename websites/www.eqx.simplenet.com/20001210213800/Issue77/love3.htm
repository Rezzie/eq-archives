<b>Part Three</b>
<br><br>
	"I have it!" Hargor's excitement could be felt throughout the room.  His apprentices all glanced at him unobtrusively, they all knew what would happen if any of them showed the slightest sign that they had heard.  The man was brilliant, but a tyrant.  As one, they quickly returned to their studies when Hargor swept the room with his gaze.  They all breathed a sigh of relief, again as one, when he stormed out, up the tower steps, and into his work room, slamming the door with a resounding thud.    A few seconds later the door opened and he bellowed for Lysinda to the top.  The students knew then that it was nothing to fear for Lysinda was the youngest and therefor was the one chosen for menial tasks, message running, component collections and so forth.  As she rose to climb the steps to her Master her fellow apprentices smiled in encouragement.
<br><br>
"I need you to deliver this to the Paladin Diane at this very moment, if not sooner child!"  Hargor handed her a tightly rolled and sealed scroll.  <i>It's probably spelled as well</i> -- thought Lysinda as she bowed and made her way down the steps, out the door and across the courtyard at a sharp clip.
<br><br>
When she arrived at the Temple to Mithaniel Marr she bowed low before the Sentries there, "I have an important message for Paladin Diane!"  Lysinda announced in a firm voice.
<br><br>
"Your in luck then," The Sentry Mahgan smiled down at the girl, "she is in residence and speaking with the Master.  I'll send someone to fetch her for you."
<br><br>
As Lysinda waited, she marveled again at the majesty and beauty of the Temple and it's grounds. The temple itself a marvel of architecture.  The tall and empyreal tower with balconies for the Sentries to watch for the evil creatures of Lies and Darkness overlooked the courtyard like the benevolent twin God and Goddess it represented.  She wondered, never stepping foot inside, what marvels the huge, golden entrance door hid.  The courtyard itself was a wonder of beauty,  so white and sparkling, a magnificent spring fed fountain, and huge glassy white paving stones.  One felt impious when walking upon them.  Three sets of steps marching down from the causeway into the courtyard with the temple looming protectively on the forth side.  Only one arching entrance into the courtyard and one entrance into the temple.  So beautiful in it's majestic simplicity.  Lysinda was broken abruptly from her ruminations by Diane's arrival.
<br><br>
"Oh!"  The startled girl's eyes went wide as Diane appeared by her side.  Twisting around to catch a glimpse of the interior, only seeing a darkened hall with the flickering of a flame to one side, she looked up guiltily at the woman.  "I have a message for you from Master Wizard Hargor."  She blushed red as her voice squeaked forth.  She handed the scroll to the tall Paladin.
<br><br>
	"Why thank you, girl, your fortitude shall be rewarded forthwith.  Just as soon as I read the message."  Diane calmly broke the seal, with out any words, motions or incantations, much to Lysinda's heart-stopping fear.  And then, to Lysinda's embarrassment, nothing happened when the scroll unrolled quite normally.  Remembering to breathe again, Lysinda waited patiently while Diane's eyes scanned the message.
<br><br>
	"Tell your Master that I will be arriving within the hour."  Diane smiled at the girl and pressed a silver into her hands, suppressing a laugh as Lysinda's eyes glowed and a delighted grin slowly curved her lips.
<br><br>
	"Thank you, Ma'am.  And I will deliver your message immediately."  And off she ran.  Not a half-hour later Diane arrived at the Wizards tower and Lysinda grinned as she watch Paladin and Wizard secret themselves within Hargor's private chambers and slipped, unnoticed, from her chair and into the store room.
<br><br>
	Looking around to see if anyone was in the little closet, Lysinda squeezed behind one of the cabinets and into a dark, narrow tunnel.  Quietly winding her way up the well traveled incline she eased into place to peek out the hole and spy on Master's meeting with the Paladin.  Hearing the voices and what was said floating through the hidey hall, Lysinda caught her breath!  The other's would have to know about this and soon!
<br><br>
	"...and I need you to bring the couple here tomorrow night, so I can bestow my gift upon them."  The Wizards smile seemed entirely sincere as he spoke to Diane, but Lysinda knew better.  This <i>couple</i> of which he spoke were in deep trouble.
<br><br>
	"Oh, my friend, my very dear friend...." Diane gushed, "Your generosity exceeds itself in this gift you wish to bestow!  You have hitherto been very helpful in our righteous cause, but this... this... THIS is beyond and above!"  Diane positively glowed with pleasure.
<br><br>
Lysinda knew what Hargor did with all the creatures that had used his and Diane's so called  <i><b>underground trail</b></i>.  <i>All those poor people</i>--thought Lysinda--<i>eyes all aglow with hope, only to find themselves shipped off to the Deathfist Clans to become slaves.</i>  Lysinda and some of the other apprentices had saved some of, but not all, the creatures trying to find freedom in a new place.  They snuck through anyway they could, Diane would find them, and bring them to Hargor.  Then they would all disappear and the Paladin thought she was doing good works for the other races, but didn't know what Lysinda and the others knew.  Now, Hargor was going to get two more slaves out of the deal.  Tears began to streak Lysina's cheeks as she felt the deepest pity for whoever t'Ceira and Darvinn were.
<br><br>
The next night, a delighted Diane brought t'Ceira and Darvinn the secret ways to Hargor's tower and presented them to the Wizard's private chambers.  "And may you're lives be full of joy, my very dear friends!"  Diane hugged t'Ceira and shook Darvinn's huge hand.   t'Ceira's eyes glowed with joy as she hugged Diane with real warmth and friendship, not knowing that on the other side of the wall sat at crying child named Lysinda watching with honor and pity for these two unknown people. 
<br><br>
Beaming up at her love and life, Darvinn,  t'Ceira whispered, "I can't believe it, my love!  We're finally going to go to Neriak!  And you with me!  And then we can be mated!" Impulsively she grabbed his arm and hugged as hard as she could.   Feeling that all his, and her dreams, were about to come true, he gently picked up the Dark Elf and kissed her with total love, adoration, and passion, hugging her lithe body to him.  Which, to his delight, she returned by snuggling into his embrace and trying to wrap her arms around him.  Hargor slipped into the room just in time to witness the tender scene and only Lysinda saw the look of total unreasoning rage and jealousy cross his face.   <i>Goddess Erolisi save us!</i>--Lysinda thought--<i>He's insane!</i>
<br><br>
	"Uchuummmm... well, well... now..." Hargor cleared his throat after arranging his features into a benevolent smile, "... now, there'll be plenty of time for that you two!  Have you got everything you want to take?"  At their mutual nods, he continued, "Ok... I need you to stand here t'Ceira, and you to stand over there Darvinn!"  Hargor pointed to two circles with arcane marks etched inside them.  Lysinda noticed these marks as the couple stepped into them and her brows furrowed with puzzlement.  <i>This is different</i>--She thought to herself, and watch now with more concentration.
<br><br>
	"Now you two... I'll be casting a few spells and will be very tired after words.  But, you deserve it." Hargor's cold blue eyes gazed steadily at t'Ceira. "But, have no fear, my dear, when I'm done you'll be in Neriak and be free to be with the one you truly deserve!"  t'Ceira's heart began to flutter with the words so obviously directed to her, she began to feel a bit of fear.  If it had not of been for Diane assuring them that Hargor had helped her with all those people, t'Ceira would have bolted right then.  Every nerve in t'Ceira told her to RUNNNN!
<br><br>
	"Well, now...." Hargor turned to regard both of them, "Ready?"
<br><br>
	The lovers looked at each other and nodded.  t'Ceira resisted the sudden urge to run to Darvinn and kiss and hold him one more time as Hargor began his casting.  An evil green light began to rise from his fingertips and engulf her lover, but before she could react the light began to tingle along her skin.  She felt breathless, changed somehow, and a little unsteady on her feet.  A tiny sound caught her attention and she turned her head suddenly toward the sound, catching a glimpse of Lysinda through the peek hole.  <i>I wonder why she's looks so scared?</i>--t'Ceira thought as Hargor began another spell this time with a blue light to accompany the words and gestures.  t'Ceira saw the girls eyes widen and a silent "NO!" shape her lips as the world dissolved around the Elf.
<br><br>
	The gasping, whispered "NO!"  echoed through the suddenly silent chamber as first Darvinn and then t'Ceira disappeared from Hargor's sight.   His head suddenly turned to the sound and he laughed as he noticed Lysinda through the hole.  He had known about the hidey place for a very, very long time, and it had served its purpose, but now, he needed no witnesses.
<br><br>
	"Well, my dear, JOIN ME!"  His hand again moved into a spell and shortly Lysinda arrived, moving with jerks and halts.  Hargor waved his hand again.  Suddenly released, Lysinda fell to the ground in a sobbing heap of hair and cloth.
<br><br>
	"You've cursed them, Master!"  She sobbed.
<br><br>
	"Yes, my dear, and now it's your turn!"  This time red light issued from his hands and thunder cracked the air as the light engulfed the girl.  Her hands flew to her throat as she uselessly gasped for air.  Another crack ripped through the air and the red light squeezed even more of her breath from her.  She felt herself weaken, her limbs falling to the floor as if too heavy to lift.  Once more thunder cracked and the red light shot out, and it was over.  Lysinda a dead and burning mess of scorched cloth lying in the floor and the echo of Hargor's laughter floated through the tower.
