<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;From an RP standpoint, what is the best race and class to roleplay?  
<br>
Ardel
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can you ask?  My goodness, everyone knows that a halfelf bard is the MOST marvelous race and class for roleplay -- charm, wit, beauty, talent, imagination, creativity, you name it -- halfelf bards claim it!  Now as soon as you have stopped giggling, I'll get real.  In Everquest, every race and class has roleplay appeal.  Personally, I think human might be the hardest race to rp because dialect to help establish a personality is rare plus the human psyche is the most familiar to us all (or at least most of us unless Everquest has is now sold beyond the Solar Systemg and space aliens have joined the game).  I honestly think warriors might be the hardest class to roleplay because their true personality is most apparent in melee which is only part of the life of Norrath.  Of course, I am constantly amused by the ogres and trolls with their barshing speak, and I am usually irritated by the haughty glances the high elves allow to slide down their long thin noses.  Oh, it's not possible to choose the best among all these possibilities.  However, since we are now at nearly the darkest night of the year, I can tell you that if I really did have to choose the best race and class to roleplay, I'd choose a halfling druid with a snug living room, a roaring fire, branches of cedar decking the walls and my friends all grouped around for stories and winter wine.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; As is well known the creatures of Tunare are friends of Rangers and Druids and as such we respect and protect them, but on those rare occasions when killing one is necessary does it reduce their affection for you?  Can killing many of Tunare's creatures make them try to kill you like they kill non rangers and druids?  Wondering,
<br>
Frackenor, Ranger of the 8th Season, Follower of Karana
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is good reason for all who follow Tunare to respect and protect her creatures as you have said.  However, Tunare cares about all life, including yours, so my guess is that she understands if necessity causes you to take the life of a creature that shares the world with you in a kindly way.   Thus, I think you can figure that should you kill a rabid wolf or a bear from whose hide you need to make clothing, that the action will not be held against you.   Even if you kill many, if your intent as a follower of Tunare is pure, your standing with her animals should remain as it was before.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I love the Q&A --- Please Please and Pretty Please add a search section :)   My question is about spell casting.  First off I am a Druid of the 20th season.  I have noticed that sometimes when I cast the spell is interrupted and yet I have not moved or been struck how is this possible?  Second when a spell fizzles does it still use that spells cost for mana or some percentage?  And just my 2cp about Bards:  what is not to like about them they are always happy because they are singing :)

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now a search engine installed with Everquest Express and I hope you enjoy using it to find out about topics that interest you.    Moving on to your spell interruption questions, I must tell you that a wizard Pillar of Wisdom insists that all problems people write to me about are simply a matter of faction.  Now, he often does have insight into the invisible world of magic that bards know so little of, but somehow I think the more mundane explanations I have come across will apply better.  First of all, if you miss a "roll" your spell can be interrupted.  Also, some druids and other casters have said that it seems like having a tree or a rock or even another person too close can also cause your spell to be interrupted.  Casters also seem to need to wait a short period after moving before casting as even if they see themselves stopped, it is possible that the spell  will be interrupted if it is cast too soon.  There may be others factors not covered here.  If anyone knows additional reasons that spells are interrupted, please let me know.  Fizzles, however, are directly related to your skill and level.  While they do take mana, they take only a percentage of the normal amount of mana required for a successful spell.  Thanks for writing and I'm glad you like bards!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail!  I have a question that has been brewing for several weeks.  When I first started my Rogue, I learned that if I pick pocketed the creature, that the loot shared by the party was not affected.  Perhaps my skill located loot in those hard to reach folds of clothing.  Anyway, several people now think that Rogues pick pocket skill does reduce the cash loot for the party on the shills, er I mean monsters.  So which is it, does Rogues pick pocket skill actually allow him to take a bigger share of the pie by reducing the party's share?  Or does the Rogue simply find loot stashed in places that the party never thinks to loot?

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be one of those debates that won't be settled until the mighty Aradune himself descends into the pit of argument and declares the truth.  As I haven't seen any flashing swords on the horizon nor glints of green armor, I'm going to go with the best answer I know.  Originally, back in beta, the loot a rogue stole by pickpocketing was separate from the loot available to a group that killed the mob.  However, it is my understanding that after release that system was changed and while now a rogue may not be able to pickpocket all the loot on a mob, any loot taken by the rogue will reduce the amount available for the group to split if they kill the npc after the rogue has attempted to empty its purse.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I am a recent newbie of Everquest and I love the game.  I would like to know how to do a couple minor things that would enhance and speed up my game play.  For one, how can I find out the specs on inventory items, such as spell scrolls, weapons or clothing items?  I know there is a way to find out how much damage my weapons can produce, I just haven't found it!  Secondly, when looting a dead corpse, is there a speedy way to move things from the corpse over to my inventory rather then clicking each bat wing and moving them one-by-one???  Lastly, how do I know which spells and at which levels I, as a Ranger, can use?  Your answers will be appreciated! Thank you,
<br>
Sylo, Ponderer of Nature and foe to the Orcs...
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the community of Norrath and I hope you continue to love the game.  I think you'll be delighted with the ease you can obtain the information you inquired about.  First, if you want to know the specs on inventory items, you need to right click on the item and hold it down.  A description window will pop up that will give you basic information on the item, including (usually) which races and classes may use it.  Be aware that while the information is accurate, it may not give you a complete description of all that the item does or is used for (especially quests).   Rightclicking and holding on the icon of your weapons will give you the basic stats for that weapon.  If you are not familiar with the measurement system for speed and damage, you might want to use the /ooc channel and ask  others in the zone if they can explain it to you.   Rightclicking is also used for looting your corpse and speeds up the process considerably.  When you rightclick on an item in your corpse, it is automatically transferred to your inventory.  Watch your inventory carefully, though, as if it is full and you right click on an item in your corpse, the item will fall to the ground and quite likely disappear.  If I'm starting with an empty inventory when I loot, I usually start with clothing items, click 8 of them and then move them up to equipment slots before looting the next 8 items.  Wouldn't it be nice if we had a "loot all" command that returned everything to the spot it belonged?  As for your spells, the best place to find ingame information is your guild.  If you go to your guild and find the vendor that sells spells, you can click on each of his wares and it will give you the name of the spell and at what level you can use it.  You'll also often find a friendly high level ranger that will be willing to answer your questions and offer advice on how best to proceed along your way.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;G'day Nep, time for a lil question...do certain effects stack?  I was thinking, having Journeyman's Boots, a bard singing the speedsong and also having a SOW..will all of them contribute to your speed?? If not which one will??  I was also thinking of the haste effect...I think there are 3 items with haste (or maybe more) but will I hit faster with all than if I only had 1 item??
<br>
Avathar Daikana
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigh, as much as I would love to answer your question by bobbing a very happy "yes", I'm afraid my head is nodding a very sad "no".  SOW will be cancelled by the bard travel song and neither the song nor SOW will stack with journeymen boots.  Haste, however, works a bit differently.  While you may not stack haste equipment for additional effect, you can stack an item and a haste buff quite nicely.   I'm not sure if a bard song with an occasional haste (i.e., like in anthem of arms) will stack in addition to an item and a buff but it would be interesting to figure out.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Nep, My question is regarding the "Lay Hands" skill that we paladins have. I understand that it can only be used once per game day, and that's fair. Also, if one dies, then the "lay hands" skill can be used again... What I don't understand, is why, after logging out, and coming back, say, 10 game days later, I still can't use Lay Hands! So, say it's 3AM game time, Jan 15, and I Lay Hands, and log back in at 4PM, Jan 25... why must I wait until 3AM, Jan 26?   Thanks,
<br>
Caalie
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, I think I see why you are wondering about this.  To start with, it's important to know that the game clock is completely separate from the real life clock.  Thus, when you log off the server your game clock stops.  Mana regeneration, lay hands, etc. -- in fact any skill or spell that is affected by time -- will simply stay at the point on the clock where it was when you logged.  Thus, regardless of how long you have been away from Everquest, the game clock does not recognize the passage of time.  There is one important exception to this with corpses.  From level 6 on up, corpses are measured by both game clock and real time clock.  A corpse will last up to 24 hours of game play (measured from the time you hit the chat server I believe), but if you are not on Everquest, the corpse will last up to 7 days real time.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I remember reading somewhere that one can gain skill in melee abilities or other skills by dueling someone else or fighting a PC in the arena.  I tested this out myself the other day but nothing went up for 5 minutes...  can you confirm if this is true or not? My mage would certainly like to avoid battle as much as possible and raising lagging skills in his spare time would be helpful. Thanks! 
<br>
Dhaeyn Daronol
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common answer I could find to your question was that melee and casting skills will not improve via duels or pc fights in the arena.  However, one of my Pillars of Wisdom recalls recently hearing a monk state that he was able to handily raise his skill in intimidation by duelling.  I'm sorry I don't have a more definite answer for you.  I'd be really interested in hearing what experiences other players have had with this situation.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;#1. Is there a site that shows the prices for the spells that are used in the game.  #2. Is there a guide that helps a "newbie" as to where he gets his extra spell, equipment, and anything else he needs?
<br>
Katelia
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't really know of any site that lists prices for game spells and if it did, it might be inaccurate as your charisma will affect the price that is quoted for you.  The best way to plan for buying spells is to find the spell vendor in your guild house, note the names of the spells and the price he or she is charging for it as well as the level at which the spell is useable by you and then start banking the coins you will need.   As for "newbie" guides, you actually have several different options, each of which will give a different perspective.  First you have the manual that comes with the game, then the online manual which is located in your EQ  folder and is updated by patches from time to time.  There is also an excellent graphic tutorial which I urge you to use if you haven't done so already.  It is SUCH a good introduction to playing.  The major game news sites online, such as EQ Vault (http://eqvault.ign.com/), also include newbie guides which offer advice on how to get started.  Finally, I want to suggest that the most fun way to find out about spells, equipment and smiting is to find a friendly face (or a gruesome one if you happen to be an ogre or a troll) and ask for some help getting started in the newbie zones.  Should you have a question you can't answer, you may also try using /petition.  The GM's and Everquest Guides  cannot tell you game secrets but often they can steer you in the right direction and give you a little moral support along the way.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Love the column:)  A quick question : What is alt.everquest?!  On eqvault.com and eq.stratics, they always post messages from alt.everquest.  Is this the official EQ board on the EQ website?  Is it a newsgroup?  How do I find this mystical place?:)  Thanks!
<br>
Lurkin
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering that myself actually, so I went to the Pillars of Wisdom who unanimously told me that alt.everquest is a newsgroup, accessible by a newsgroup program.  If you are using later versions of IE or Netscape, they should have built in programs to get you there.  I don't believe alt.everquest is an "official" site, but it is one that is visited by developers from Verant.  The only official site I am aware of for Everquest is at www.everquest.com  where you will find mostly up-to-date information on the game, technical issues and support.  There is also a message board set up there for posting on general and specific matters having to do with Everquest.  
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am the quest and riddle master for my guild, Sanctus Covenir on the Povar server.  As such I dish out tasty riddles to my guildmates, and construct wild quests for them to complete to win their luscious prizes like crested helms and Chitin breast plates.  They are allowed to get help from others in solving riddles, and help to accomplish the quest (as long as it people within 5 levels of them).  Now they have turned the tables on me.  I must return to my friend Helter Skelter, Enchanter 44, "The earthen matter found only on the Orange, the cast metal carried by Paul, and the serrated shackle."  My first attempts were fire elementals ("the Orange") and a Serrated Bone Dirk in Guk (casts Engulfing Darkness, which is a "shackle" of sorts) but I have since found these leads to be fruitless.  Any thoughts as to where I might go to pursue this fiendish quest?

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my goodness, I could find no one who even wanted to take a stab at answering your riddle.  It sounds like your guildmates have given you a worthy challenge indeed and I am hopeful you will be able to solve it.    Good luck!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Nep, allow me to add my own voice to the plethora of responses I know you'll be getting on this issue.  I'm a level 15 cleric on Rallos Zek, and I can personally attest that melee combat is allowed on boats (or at least it has been in the past).  It's regrettable, because I am unable to fulfill my calling as a healer in that situation.  Instead, I am forced to watch, powerless, as people are brutally slaughtered left and right before my very eyes!  Well, okay, it's not quite *that* bad.  But still...
<br>
Tiegan - Cleric of Tunare &lt;Knights of Brightblade&gt;
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously, you were the only person who wrote me on the boat melee situation.  I'm wondering how long it has been since you experienced the pvp melee on boats and whether a change has occurred since then.  Let's hope some others write in to clarify this so we may all be assured of the safest sea journeys  possible.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My last name is Kinory. Kinory is a rare last name. I am wonder as to how it became the name of a character in your stories.
<br>
Adam
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm Kinory is indeed used by Aklar in <em>Rogue: A Tale of Treachery</em>.  I just used the new handy-dandy search engine and discovered he appeared in many of the installments.  I don't know how the name came to be used by Aklar but let's ask the editor if perhaps he could forward a message to the author to find out.  Who knows, maybe there is an intriguing reason for immortalizing the last name of Kinory.
<br><br>
<em>[It's me, Absor!  Hi!  I love inserting myself in here.  Anyhow...  Kinory was the lead character in the Rogue stories, and it was her first name, not her last.  I'll send Aklar the question about how she came up with the name, if she's not too busy becoming a </em>real<em> author.]</em>
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Neppy, my questions is: When are you going to honour your fellow guildmates with your presence and smite mightily with us? As a comment, I've been following your column and I have to say you're doing an excellent job with providing intelligent answers to the questions of our fellow Norrathians (there such a thing?). I read your column when I get the chance and am entertained by it. Just thought you should know. =)

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah you tricky wizard you!  I went to the other Pillars of Wisdom for an answer to your question and they all replied, "Come smite!"  Which, I might add, I proceeded to go do (ridding the world of at least a handful of sulfurous goblins) and which is also the reason I am sitting, quill in hand in the wee hours of the morning answering your letter instead of sleeping in the cozy bed here in the upstairs of the inn.  Adelrune, of course, claims that I will smite regularly when my faction issues are resolved.  Tagad, the cleric, asserts in his usual mystical fashion that I will be smiting with you the next time the moon is in alignment with Pluto.  Regardless of who is correct, I thank you for reading the Q&A and for delighting me with your enjoyment of it.



<br><br><br>
Thanks to you all for writing in with your questions.  I look forward to hearing from you again.
