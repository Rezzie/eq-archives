<b><em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
I am only young Ogre, but I hear your wisdom legendary and I hope you can help me with problem.  Maybe is all because Ma & Pa used ta bash me silly, regardless of if I been a good ogre-pup, or not.  This may sound demented, coming from grownup Ogre, but how can I become 'good'?
<br><br>
I am Shaman, an eduk...  edyuc... a Smart Ogre and old Zek has been pretty good ta me so far, but I want ta make Love, not War.  Oh, I still like ta bash things, lizards and frogs, spiders and bugs, skeletons and such.  Even bashing those funny dog-boys and walking-shrooms is fun and I expect there are Lots of other fun things ta bash out there in the world.
<br><br>
However, there's all those 'Little People' out there too.  I meet them here and there.  Some call me 'Cute' and embarrass me, and I think they're kinda cute too, in a funny-looking way.  Others just bash me, even when I'm friendly.
<br><br>
Anyway, I hear that there are Lots More of them out there.  Not just Trolls, but 'Hummies' and 'Inkies' and other kinds of 'Elfies' and different kinds of 'ankle-biting Squatties', many, many more than all the Ogres I've ever seen, put together.
<br><br>
This makes me think, which is not as hard as Ma & Pa said, and I wonder if I can't do something ta make all these 'Littles' like me?  I don't want ta bash them, but it is hard ta be nice when they are bashing you good.  I think they not like old Zek much either and, although he's been okay ta me, maybe if I follow some other 'Great Spirit' they'll like me more?
<br><br>
I hope you are not confused now, because I sure am.  Help me Auntie Moog, you're my only hope!
<br><br>

<b>Dear MogUr
<br><br>
You embarrass Moog!  I just old troll who likes to help.  Not so wise!  But Moog tink that you gots to do what make you happy.  For most troll/ogre dis means lotsa barshing!  If you not like barshing, den you kinda weird…but dat ok!  Take all kinds, I always say.  What you gots do is do good stuff, like kill de enemies of the "Littles" and odder stuff that makes em happy.  Some will never like you much, but after long time, dey will let you come to dere cities and such.
