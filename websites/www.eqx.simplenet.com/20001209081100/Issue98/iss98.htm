Furlespit cackled with glee as the bookkeeper pushed out a cart of material that was soon to be burnt. Much was fit for nothing more than such, but occasionally she would find fine reading material in these piles. She suspected the bookkeeper knew of her exploits in his trash, but feared questioning her about it. She was a rather strange Tier'dal after all.

The troll had the halfling<br>
Hung over his fire<br>
Trussed up like a turkey<br>
And wrapped in steel wire

"You am what you am<br>
And you is what I seek<br>
A fill for my belly<br>
Then a doze for a week"

With a resounding clatter the whirlwind crumbled to the ground dispersing all that it had once held firmly in its grasp.  Rocks, loose coins, bone fragments all were cast across the ground.  With a few minutes search I managed to locate the items that were worthwhile.  Amid the few gold and silver coins was a hunk of ore, as yet unrefined, that could be used to make metal, had I the skill to do so.  Regardless, it was worth plenty on the market.

This weekend should be fun.  I get to run a game for the holiday.  It's become a tradition amongst us that I run this game on Halloween.  Not a real great tradition, since it's been years since I've run it.  And I had a heck of a time locating it.  It's called 'The Mansion of Mad Professor Ludlow', and if you can find yourself a copy, I recommend it.  It's a great little short adventure.

Let us pray.
<br><br>
No, really, let us pray.  Maybe what I mean is let us worship.  EverQuest has twenty-three gods, fifteen which have been defined on the EverQuest website and nine which have been added as server names.  When I read community posts about clerics, or I look at the cleric handbooks and the cleric websites, the gods are never mentioned<b>...</b>

I just wanted to give some feedback on the website and in particular one of the authors, Nepenthia. I think the site is very well put together and the ease of which you can find things and the links between them well connected. I read what was listed for Nepenthia and wanted to just express my appreciation for her writing.
