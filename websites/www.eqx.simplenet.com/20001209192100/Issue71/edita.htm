Two wrongs do not make a right.  This is one of those 'truisms' that I actually believe in.  There are a lot of them that I don't.  That whole thing about death and taxes is a crock.  There are a whole bunch more inevitable things in life, many of them much less pleasant than those two.  And if I'm what I eat, then I'm the ugliest Quarter Pounder I've ever seen.  Or maybe I'm confusing truisms with cliches.  Oh well, I've got bigger fish to fry in this editorial.
<br><br>
I've been lucky so far in EverQuest.  I've only been 'trained' once on purpose since retail that I am aware of.  The guy thought that I swiped his kill, and I thought he was trying to take it from me.  Messy thing.  He decided to dump three skeletons on me in revenge.  The first time I thought he was just overwhelmed, so I helped him out.  The second time I knew he was doing it on purpose.  We had a short argument about it, and then I moved on.  The worst part about this was that he decided to dump those skeletons on me while I was talking to a brand new player, trying to give him a few pointers.  That poor guy got killed during both 'trains'.  I haven't seen him since.
<br><br>
So here's a hypothetical for you.  You're a magician (or a necromancer) on, say, Bristlebane.  You're camping at your favorite spot with your necromancer (or magician) friend, waiting for the next spawn.  Another group shows up.  You ask them if they want to share the spawns, each taking turn.  They don't respond.  The enemy suddenly appears and the other group lays into them.  You figure that you'll take the next spawn, since you were resting anyway, and you tell your new neighbors that exact thing.  They don't respond.
<br><br>
Then the next bunch of nasties appear and you engage them with your pet.  So does your friend.  Then, suddenly, your pet calls you nasty names and commits suicide.  A few seconds later your friend's skeleton (or elemental) does the same.  You look over to see that your friend is also gone!  He appears seconds later when he is forced to defend himself as the monsters charge him and begin taking him apart.  You worry about him, but not so much as you worry about yourself as you are also torn limb from limb.
<br><br>
You're baffled.  So is your friend.  But you've had a good day so far, and you trot back to your mangled corpse to recover your precious items and get a snack.  All that running naked through the woods makes you hungry.  You arrive to note that the other group is still there, mopping up the enemy.  After your friend finally returns (he's from one of those far off places, you know), you again wait for your turn at the enemy.
<br><br>
Again you disappear, your pets kill themselves (and you're starting to think that new ones are gonna turn down the job when you summon them), and you run off with the whole camp of enemies behind you.  You barely make it to the guards, who kindly save you from another unpleasant death.  Your friend isn't so lucky, however.  You rest while he jogs back to meet you and recover his stuff.
<br><br>
Now you're no fool.  You know what happened.  The wretched enchanter in that other group turned you and your friend invisible, causing your pet to go insane with grief at losing you and commit suicide.  You know that this is considered by the lawmakers of the land to be harassment and unfair use of a bug to cause you undue pain.  So you send out a /petition to the Guides of Norrath with the hope that they will explain this to the other group, and so that you can go back to hunting in your favorite spot.  You wait a while and there is no response.  You check and discover that there are no GMs in the world right now.  In fact, you have never seen a Guide or a GM on line.  You know that these folks will again destroy your pets if you go back.  You also suspect that they would do this horrible thing to others, given even the slightest provocation.
<br><br>
So what do you do?
<br><br>
I have recently been involved in a somewhat heated debate over this very issue.  I have been told that it is perfectly reasonable to stand up for your rights in this case, especially when you know that no official aid will be arriving any time soon.  Therefore it is acceptable to treat these abusive folks as they treated you.  Most suggest that you find yourself a really big giant (not one of those little ones) and get its attention.  Then run over to talk to the folks that treated you so poorly.  While you talk to them, the giant will be teaching them the lessons of life.
<br><br>
I don't agree.  Purposefully dragging nasty creatures onto other characters with the sole purpose of killing them (thus circumventing the switch) is considered harassment.  Certainly hard to prove, and I'm sure that you would have to be seen doing so by a Guide more than once to be banned for it.  And heck, in the scenario above you know that you're not going to get caught.  So why not?
<br><br>
I don't disagree with retaliation like that just because it is a violation of the rules.  I disagree with it because it is a violation of the rules, and because it doesn't solve anything.  It only teaches the other guy that you're as nasty as they are, and that, in a way, justifies their actions.  It makes you just another thug.  EverQuest has enough in-character thugs (PCs and NPCs), we don't need to turn this into a battle that goes beyond the characters.
<br><br>
At least that was the editorial that I was planning on writing.  But last night I heard about the killings at the school in Colorado (yes, I'm actually writing this one early this week).  It occurred to me this morning, while driving in to work and listening to people talk about this tragedy, that maybe I knew those kids.  Not those exact kids, but maybe someone just like them.  Think about it.  We hang out in a community where we have no idea of the age of the person we are talking to.  We don't' know where they live.  We don't know what they do in when they are not on line.  We don't know how hard life has treated them, or how well they are dealing with it.
<br><br>
Now I've been in some heated discussions with folks in newsgroups before.  I usually try to keep in mind that there is a real person behind the text.  I try not to get out of hand when responding, no matter how offensive and just-plain-wrong the other person is.  But I've lost my temper and flamed my fair share of people.  I have rarely felt guilty about it.  By the time I get mad enough to go after someone, I figure they've earned it.
<br><br>
But then I think about others out there.  What if (and I'm fully aware how far-fetched this is) I push that button, the final insult that makes someone lose it.  Maybe we're not talking about someone going on a killing spree.  Maybe one act of EQ revenge makes gets one innocent character killed.  What if this ruins that person's day (I've known people to get very upset when losing all of their items).  What if this person wasn't too stable to begin with and takes it out on his wife later that night.
<br><br>
For me it's not really the possibility of an isolated incident that bothers me.  We can't possibly expect to be perfect, and isolated fits of anger will happen with all of us.  It's the atmosphere that we create in our community that matters to me.  If we start to become vigilantes we sour the game.  A sour game will make for sour players.  Now I'm pretty good at separating my gaming world from the real world.  I've had lots of practice.  But if I have a bad game, for whatever reason, it tends to carry over into my life.  If my favorite character dies, I'm going to be a bit upset for a while (I got over it…).  So it would be pretty reasonable for me to think that others might have emotional reactions to what happens in EverQuest.  Some of you will say that it makes no sense to get emotional over a game.  It is, after all, only a game.  And I agree, to a point.  But at some point it also becomes an investment.  You invest time and effort into your characters.  Even if you don't have any emotional investment (and I would argue that this is where power gamers and roleplayers diverge) in your character, you will still feel a loss when something happens to it.
<br><br>
And it goes beyond just what happens to characters.  Taking revenge on 'cheaters' or abusive people is, really, attacking the person behind the screen.  You're not doing it to get back at their character.  Your character isn't taking revenge on their character.  It's you going after them.  It real people getting angry at other real people.  If you say otherwise, I think you're either lying or just not looking at it closely enough.
<br><br>
Please, let's not make it a personal issue.  Not that anger part anyhow.  Take the friendships, the challenge, the fun.  Take all that with you, make that personal.  But don't make Norrath a sour place.  I don't make this plea to those that are going to hassle people.  They won't listen to me anyway.  I'm talking to those of you that think revenge is a good tool.  Just think about it for a while.
