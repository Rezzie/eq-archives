<b>Lesser Faydark - Gilerrin</b>
<br><br>
	He heard something, but he ignored it.  Probably the wind.  Or an animal passing.  He reflected on his life again, thinking of his adventures and journeys.  All the battles.  All the wars.  All his youth.  All his life.
<br><br>
	He heard an unnatural rustle and immediately opened his eyes.  A young Elf gleamed at him with pride.  Only then did Gilerrin see his own sword's point at his throat.  He smiled fondly at the boy, concealing his surprise.
<br><br>
	He knew the boy knew that he was surprised and was expecting a little verbal praise from him.  But today he just smiled.  Inside, he criticized his unawareness.  I should've noticed.  I heard that sound.  I didn't get up.  Why didn't I get up?  Lack of sleep, no doubt.  Stop rambling on Gilerrin, you're getting too old for this.  Oh well, time for a lesson.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin casually moved his arms and rubbed his eyes, letting down the boy's guard.  Suddenly, he quickly but carefully grabbed the blade, avoiding the edges, swerved it away, and gave a powerful kick on the boy's chest.  The sword flew and Gilerrin grabbed its handle while jumping up to his feet, leaving his left foot on the boy's chest.  He pointed the sword at the boy's neck.
<br><br>
	He noticed he wasn't panting when he saw the boy's disappointment.  The boy knew he couldn't beat Gilerrin, but he took pride in making Gilerrin pant.
<br><br>
	"Get up," Gilerrin said.
<br><br>
	The sword was still at the boy's neck, and the boy was confused.
<br><br>
	"Get up."
<br><br>
	Then the boy seemed to understand.  He kicked out with his legs at Gilerrin's.  Gilerrin dodged nimbly, but the sword remained.
<br><br>
	"Never do that.  If you had succeeded, I would have fallen toward you."
<br><br>
	He saw that the boy understood that meant death.  The boy tried to kick the sword, but Gilerrin met his foot with his own.
<br><br>
	"It will go up, not away."
<br><br>
	Again, the boy knew that if accomplished, death if not serious injury.  He paused, thinking of new ideas.
<br><br>
	"Best you submit if you aren't very skilled."
<br><br>
	The boy relaxed, and the sword left.
<br><br>
	Why do I keep thinking he's a boy?  He's almost fourteen.  Gilerrin silently laughed.
<br><br>
	"Why don't you have a wife?" the boy asked.
<br><br>
	"Too busy."
<br><br>
	Gilerrin smiled; they talked about this every day.
<br><br>
	"When then?" said the boy.
<br><br>
	"Perhaps in a couple thousand years."  When I'm dead.
<br><br>
	"You're nice and handsome and intelligent…" trailed the boy.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin pointed his sword at the boy.  "Learn that lesson."
<br><br>
	The boy knew Gilerrin often changed subjects when uncomfortable and he was proud for "manipulating" Gilerrin.  Gilerrin knew the boy and his pride and was glad.  Let him have a life of accomplishments.  For each mistake I teach, he will gain a boon.
<br><br>
	"You're kind and brave," the boy continued.  "You never cry."
<br><br>
	"Even the bravest cry."
<br><br>
	"You never did.  I can imagine you throughout your life.  Brave, courageous, friendly to all.  Your list off accomplishments and deeds…"
<br><br>
	"Don't try to flatter me... and yes, I have cried before.  Often in fact."
<br><br>
	The boy wasn't surprised; he learned to expect the unexpected.  Gilerrin went on.
<br><br>
	"Did you ever weep when you were younger?  When you depended on your parents for life?  Did you ever weep with you mother, depending on her for love and comfort?"
<br><br>
	"As a baby."
<br><br>
	"You see then."
<br><br>
	"I see.  Tell me about your youth."
<br><br>
	"We must get moving."
<br><br>
	"Tell me, then we'll go."
<br><br>
	Gilerrin looked deep into the youth's amazingly curious eyes and sighed.  "You ask me so many things.  You should be more quiet."
<br><br>
	"Why did you let me go with you?"
<br><br>
	"Very well, I'll tell you, but we must get moving.  It's nearing dusk and we must find a good place to camp."
<br><br><br>

<b>Kelethin - Young Gilerrin</b>
<br><br>
	He was born on a beautiful day.  The trees seemed to bend toward the baby.  Amidst the diminishing screams of his mother, druids outside performed a quick ritual of good fortune.  They knew Gilerrin was special that day.  Tunare seemed to immediately accept him, and life flourished at her joy.  Birds and butterflies flew in and out of the little house.  The morning calls of the wolves seemed clearer.  It was like music.  The rich harmony flew through Kelethin, the deep bass vibrating the wood, the soprano flowing sweetly through the air, tingling the hearts.
<br><br>
	As Gilerrin's mother finally received the chance to hold her baby, the forest seemed to brighten and the music reached a high-pitched crescendo.  Gilerrin's father proudly watched his wife while accepting congratulations from the growing crowd of spectators.
<br><br>
	The Heartwood Master burst in and began communicating with Tunare.  After a few moments of impatience, the Master opened his eyes and said, "A pure ranger."
<br><br>
	Dill Fireshine and the other ranger guild leaders fell to their knees, thanking Tunare and asking how they could help Gilerrin become successful.  The spectators began murmuring excitedly.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin's father kissed the baby, then the mother.  He looked beseechingly at his wife and after much reluctance, she painfully handed Gilerrin to him.  The father held Gilerrin for the first time.  His eyes glinted with tears of joy and he wanted to kiss his wife again.  He wanted to cry.  He wanted to shout.  He wanted to sing the music of happiness.  He had received the gift of Tunare, the Mother!
<br><br>
	Kelethin was filled with joy and festivity that day for a little but wonderful child.

<br><br><br>
<b>Lesser Faydark - Gilerrin</b>
<br><br>
	"My father somehow knew my mother would give birth to a son and named me Gilerrin.  Another gift of Tunare I suppose."
<br><br>
	"Why have you never told me that you were special child?"
<br><br>
	"I didn't know you too well at first; I was afraid that you would start worshiping me, but you're not like that, right?"
<br><br>
	"Well, I -"
<br><br>
	The boy looked over at Gilerrin, but Gilerrin wasn't there.  He looked around silently and was about to call his name, but he realized they may have encountered danger.
<br><br>
	He heard something behind him.  Just as he turned around, he heard a roar and saw an large Orc diving for him.  The face was of pure evil, eyes glinting blood red.  The teeth were yellow and sharp, the smile definitely unnatural.  He wanted to run, but something held him.  His fear?
<br><br>
	A split second later, a well-thrown axe appeared on the Orc's forehead.  It produced a grunt of surprise, then fell, landing a few inches from the boy.
<br><br>
	"'Twixt the eyes," said Gilerrin as the boy whirled around to discover his hiding place.
<br><br>
	The boy refused to submit to his cheerful eyes, but Gilerrin pressured him.  "Admit it, you were scared."
<br><br>
	The boy denied it, even though he himself knew it was obvious he was lying
<br><br>
	Gilerrin grinned fiendishly.  "It's seemed like ages since I had this type of fun.  Come, let's find a place to camp and I'll tell you more."
