2)  The defendants claimed that the game could be played in real time.  The plaintiffs say that it cannot due to "lag".
<br><br>
<em>As to that not being real-time, I think you got it right in your
definition of what real-time is. Lag is a big problem, but they are
working on it.

Lag is a bad thing.  But real-time has a strict meaning in the realm of gaming.  Real-time = the opposite of turn based, instead of taking turns at being active, all players play concurrently. That’s all I have to say about that!

<em>26. The Defendants falsely and fraudulently represented that Ultima Online did not require a $10 monthly subscription fee separate from a players Internet connection fees. The Ultima Online packaging stated only as follows: "Internet connectivity required to set up your Ultima Online player account. A monthly service charge is applicable after your free trial period ends. If you do not have Internet access, AT&T Worldnet service is included with 30 days free Internet access." These statements are
false, and the true facts are that ORIGIN did not indicate that there would be a monthly subscription fee to use the game and a monthly fee for Internet use. Nor did they indicate that the monthly subscription fee would be $10 per month.</em>
