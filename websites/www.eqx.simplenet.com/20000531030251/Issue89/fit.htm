<b>Neriak -</b>
<br><br>
This week the Neriak tourist bureau decided to unveil its new advertising campaign aimed at drawing in tourism.
<br><br>
"We've long been ignored as one of the great tourist attractions of Norrath," said city father Eklian F'lok. "And all those tourist platinum go straight into the coffers of those stumpy Rivervale types."
<br><br>
F'lok then showed us a number of the new advertising slogans intended to showcase their nightlife (Which is 24 hours a day since Neriak is a cave), hunting in the forest of Nektulos, and the deadly hell-hole called Lavastorm, which they've referred to in their ads as a "Hot spring".
<br><br>
"Of all our ads, I prefer this one," Said F'lok, as he unveiled, 'Forget Rivervale--You'll get neckstrain'.
<br><br>
Slogans that were rejected as not being in line with the new "pro-tourism" policy included, "Come for the nightlife, stay for the carnage" and "Come to Neriak: Isn't it time you got your ass kicked?"
