In a few weeks EverQuest Express will be two.  Yup, our lil' baby will be two years old.  And we thought that for Issue 104 we should do a <em>best of</em> issue.  This serves a few purposes, really.  First, it gives new readers a chance to see what we've done that people think is worth reading, without forcing them to plow through a hundred issues to find it.  It also serves as a chance for long time readers to re-read some of the stuff that they liked.  And, maybe more importantly, it means a sort of vacation for the staff.  They don't have to pound their heads on their keyboards trying to be clever for that week.

Journal Entry - October 12, 3178
<br><br>
Mirodem has approached me today in my cubicle.  I was working on a translation from Elder Dragon into Erudin at the time that supposedly the Enchanters Guild thinks has possibilities.  Mirodem and I have never been close.  Though as the Director for the library he does command a certain amount of respect, I can't help but to feel that it is only his position that causes my fellow scribes to give any<b>...</b>

I know 50 cartoon strips is not a career of work.  But for a guy with the attention span of a gnat, that's like saying I wrote a novel!  Actually it's more like 55 strips now, but I figured issue 100 is a good time to babble.  (It's my second language!)

We used to discuss in IRC chat meetings what would make our little periodical seem more like a print magazine.  "I always think of the cover art on a magazine or the photo on the front page of a newspaper," I said.

In forgotten ages the stones were laid,<br>
And no one knows who built these halls<br>

I was thinking about MCD (Multiple Character Disorder) and how playing many characters can, at times, be exceptionally frustrating.  Sometimes I sit down at my computer to play EverQuest, manage to get to the character option screen, and get stuck.  When I sat down I was planning on playing my catch-up character<b>...</b>

During a recent visit home my father gave me a slim volume of philosophy entitled  <em>Finite and Infinite Games: A vision of Life as Play and Possibility, by James P. Carse (Ballantine, 1986)</em>.  In it are a list of principles of what the author believes are the two kinds of games that exist, and rules and conclusions about them.  I was so struck by these and their application to EverQuest and our styles of play that I decided that it would be perfect for our 100th Issue<b>...</b>

The artwork featured in Issue 99 has inspired me to write in and give the artist my highest regards, along with my hopes that he/she continues with their work.  The sketch exudes such feeling, I was really quite moved when I saw it.  A pity the artist has chosen to be anonymous, as I would be most interested in contacting them regarding a story I'm writing that could use such illustration.
