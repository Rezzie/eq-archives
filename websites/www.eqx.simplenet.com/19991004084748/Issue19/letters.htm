Dear Editor,
<br><br>
I am writing this letter in response to Ian Ash's <a href="../Issue18/mage.htm">Mage Combat</a> editorial.  While
it was an excellent editorial on Mage combat I do disagree with Ian on several
points.  While Wizards will be able to do the most amount of damage in the least
amount of time I do not think they will be the masters of the Arena.  Enchanters,
Necromancers, and Magicians have the potential to just as powerful if not more so.
<br><br>
<em>[Ed. Dorians letter was so long and well written that I've turned it into an
<a href="dorian.htm">article</a>.  So I've snipped out the middle, kept the beginning and end, and added Ian's response.
It's cool being the editor!  :) ]</em>

Great work on your site. Keep the articles and stories rolling I can't wait till the
next week to see what new wonders you have created for us fans.
<br><br>
Sincerely,

Wow, this is awesome, great points made here. I am happy that the
arguments took the form of group combat and cooperation, since that has
been a key bragging point of EverQuest's vs other games as well. Thanks
for the feedback and the comments. You made my day.
<br><br>
<em>Ian</em>
