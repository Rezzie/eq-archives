<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
This isn't really a question but a thank you to a great Troll Shaman by the name of Ooga Booga.  I am a Dark Elf Shadow Knight and as you may know it is difficult for us to get better at what we do...  But thanks to the efforts of the Shaman Ooga Booga many young Dark Elves were able to grow more quickly through the powerful enhancements that Ooga cast upon us.  Ooga stood at the entrance to Neriak and cast the enhancements free of charge to all who asked. May Innouruk guide Ooga. Once again, I just wanted to thank Ooga for his efforts.
