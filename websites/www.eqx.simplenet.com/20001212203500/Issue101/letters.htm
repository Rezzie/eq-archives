<em>Hello.
<br><br>
To be perfectly honest I was concerned that people might not like my main character in Norrath, Oxesiess, coming in on the heels of Auntie Moog.  Those that either don't know me, nor my character, I assumed they would jump to extremely fast conclusions which honestly they can't be blamed for.  That people might think perhaps I was ripping off or trying to upstage Auntie Moog.  However, I do read EQX and have since June of 1998.  I have also been fortunate enough on occasion to contribute to the newspaper in the past.  I only mention this to validate what I am about to explain.  If you look at my past submissions there is one where I speak about Oxes drawing people into RP, her style of speech/persona.  Oxesiess is an actual in game character persona that existed with the speech patterns and behavior you see today since beta.  The "Lingo" I use for Oxesiess was a lingo that became developed into the almost completely different dialect you see today by a good friend of mine and I when we started playing another game called Drakkar about six years ago.  In text speech, it can be rather hard to communicate a different *sound* of speech.
<br><br>
Down to the basics.  My characters are based on initial personality creation and then on statistics. I try to keep their persona's true to the statistics you would see if you could look at them in pure numbers. Oxes does have a slang style of speech.  I cannot, without writing at length, say anything else except that if you watch closely this week's column you will see good examples of the difference between the way Oxesiess speaks and an Ogre does.
<br><br>
No, she does not speak in proper English like an Erudin Wizard or even a human Wizard.  In fact, if you check around Halas you can find a few NPC's speaking slang close to hers.  The difference being, Oxesiess is a Warrior and has a heavier dialect. She is not a vendor in the trade of having to speak to people FOR a living, her business is standing in front of anything wanting to inflict mortal pain and death.  To take that infliction first before all others and making sure the Shaman, "Holy Ones", of her tribe live.
<br><br>
To address Oxesiess level of "smarts" which I think is completely different from her slang speech....  an Ogre Warriors starting Intelligence and Wisdom is exactly the same as a Barb Warriors.  *Exactly*.  Trolls are UNDER 9 points lower on both stats.  I do not know why it's assumed that someone with an intl. of 60, just because they grew up in the snow, should have a better grip on the world than an ogre with the same intl. just because the ogre grew up in the jungle.  Perhaps a lot of barb warriors put points into their intl.  I don't know.  I do know that 60 for Intl. is pretty dang dumb compared to the rest of the world.  Which Oxes is.
<br><br>
She's a *very* visual creature and has always desperately tried to understand the world.  Unfortunately, it's completely beyond her abilities to do so.  Her attempts end up, unless she gives up, in bringing the world down to her level.  From there, she usually tries to make herself feel better by putting it into a context that's familiar.  Hence she's pretty violent, likes to break things, believes the Tribunal is the supreme power in this world because eventually everything comes under "More Bashy", but has kind of a good heart.  She's not always sure she's doing the right thing, not to many She-barbs win the "Slam Rites" in Halas.  To do so is a great honor, she'd prolly also make a horrible full time tailor anyway, so she's careful to make sure what she is doing is right.  I guess the best description of Oxes I can give is the one I gave in <a href="../Issue75/where.htm">the article almost 6 months back</a>.  Oxesiess is a cuddly Great Dane with a blood lust problem.
<br><br>
I understand that you're missing, and probably a great many readers, Auntie Moog.  Honestly, I hope that in the time I spend writing Oxes I can bring a few laughs to those who haven't known her in Norrath or those who haven't known her in the NG I frequent.  For it's readers like you, and the gamers in Norrath not on Karana or during the times I play, I had hoped to bring the same amusement that others seem to have when they bump into her and /tell OOC, hehe!

After reading through your editorial in issue 98, and
seeing your call for Norrathian mythology, I thought
of something many people may have missed.
<br><br>
On the history section of the EverQuest website, it
says that
<br><br>
"The last of the old races to decline was the empire
of the Elves. The Elddar Forest spread across the
entire southeastern quarter of Tunaria. Cities and
villages built high into the trees housed thousands of
Wood Elves, and the marble cities of the High Elves
were built in the forest's clearings and meadows,
their white towers and spires climbing out of the
forest, higher than the tallest tree. But then came
the last curse of the gods, as Solusek Ro, Lord of
Flame, arched the spine of the serpent mountains,
bringing heat from the burning sun to the ancient
forest. The rivers ran dry, it rained less each year,
and while the great elven druids fought long and hard,
using their powerful magics to combat the change, they
could only delay the inevitable. Slowly the forest
gave way to desert, and eventually even great
Takish-Hiz crumbled and the elves were forced to flee
Tunaria, leaving much of their greatness behind."
<br><br>
A quick glance at the map that Verant provided with
EverQuest reveals that the Oasis of Marr and the
Desert of Ro now occupy the southeastern edge of
Tunaria, or 'Antonica' as we now call it. The Serpent
Mountains are a short distance to the northwest. This
indicates that what is now a barren desert was once
the forest home of a great many Elves. Think about
that, next time you decide to hunt Lockjaw.
<br><br>
Also, it was noticed that "even great Takish-Hiz
crumbled." I once heard that the nearby dungeon
Befallen was once an Elven city (dont' ask me where I
heard this, it was a long time ago) -- Is it possible
that the restless dead inhabiting this place are the
long-dead residents of this fair Elven capital?
<br><br>
So remember, Antonica was not always the realm of
humans. Back in the days when the world was new, a
glorious Elven empire spread across the land. It can
only be hoped that one day we will reclaim our old
lands.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<em>	Yes!  Befallen was an Elven city, and I believe that this information is
discovered through quests.  (If I'm wrong, someone write in and correct
me!)  I think that this is a fascinating way to uncover historical facts
about Norrath.  Did you know that the fountain in Neriak Foreign Quarter is
in honor of the first human to convince the Tier'dal to open part of their
city to commerce?
<br><br>
	I want to commend you on your analysis of the data available to us to
reach conclusions about Norrath and it's history.  It brings to mind
scholars poring over dusty tomes, trying to unearth facts about the Combine
Empire or lost Gnomish Secrets.  I would love to see books in Norrath, both
player-created and available to read in libraries (Such as Erudin's or
Neriak's).  In fact, I once wrote a proposal for a book skill on the EQSS
forums i'll have to dig up, because I think it would be a FASCINATING thing
to do to add depth to Norrath.
<br><br>
Maybe there is an article in this...

Dear Oghma:
<br><br>
	I just read the article were one of your readers blamed the Knights 
Templar for raping, and pillaging during the crusades in issue 39. You are 
entirely right about them not having a hand in any of that. The Knights 
main purpose, although it is said to have been to protect the travelers 
from bandits, was to search for sacred spiritual artifacts under the Temple 
of Solomon as well. The artifacts were then to be brought back to France 
for whatever reason. And yes they were true warriors, but only in the true 
sense of chivalry. There are a few examples of the church ordering a group 
of "Non-Believers" to be executed and they locked themselves in a castle 
with a small group of Templar Knights who were trying to protect them from 
the Churches evil scheme. So if they were willing to protect "Unbelievers" 
why would they scourge the countrywide raping and pillaging? Also the 
Knights order was so strict on sexuality that the men were not to face each 
other when sleeping in the same room, and most definitely not allowed to 
bath near one another, so as to keep from homosexual acts that usually 
would take place between monks who were committed to staying away from 
women. Mainly they were an order that upheld Chivalry to the fullest 
extent. Your information here is very descriptive and true to the point 
about that order. Thanks for sticking up for them. A book I have been 
recommending that some have found to be exceptionally interesting is Steven 
Sora's "The Lost Treasure of the Knights Templar" which has some 
interesting truths about the order as well as what happened to them after 
their demise in France/England. There are as you know several books along 
with the above mentioned that can give a person an overall TRUE story of 
their adventures and defeats. Thanks for your time.

<em>I'm glad you wrote, because we are heading into our retrospective issue and I wrote that article long ago!  The <a href="../Issue36/paladin.htm">article was Issue 36</a>, and that letter and reply did not come around until <a href="../Issue39/letters.htm">Issue #39</a>, both more than a year ago!  I have since read more about the Templars, looking for more information about this fascinating group, and I learned that the Templars were instrumental in the  rise of international banking in the Middle Ages.  So trusted and wealthy were the Templars that a merchant could deposit money at one temple and retrieve the same amount from another across the known world.  A fascinating organization, and it is unfortunate that it was their wealth that turned the greedy eyes of kings upon them.
<br><br>
Thanks for your letter, and keep reading EQX!

	I just finished reading the article by Archanalia and felt the need to
ensure that the fan base is far more than two. Every issue the first
item that my co-workers and I jump to is Lil' Archy and his friends. We
think that the strip is unique and entertaining. So keep em coming and
we'll keep laughing

Is this going to become a regular feature in Everquest Express? I hope so, it looks like it's gonna be awesome. Anyway, I loved the two postcard type artworks previously shown in EQX, and I can't wait to see more!

Grouping in EQ
<br><br>
I just read the articles in your magazine and agree totally. The point of EQ I think is to have fun with your friends you make, not see how many levels you can make in a week or who has the better armour in your group. I play EQ not for the fighting or graphics but for the extreme satisfaction you get from knowing your group is counting on you and you are counting on them. I have been in groups which are totally devoid of fun and role-playing. I have been in groups where no-one takes any responsibility for making sure everyone gets a chance to fight and loot and have a good time. Some of the best times I've had on EQ is after a huge battle with my friends regenerating and we talk. We talk about our characters, our gods, our other friends and we laugh. Some groups have no sense of this camaraderie. I have simply walked away from groups who's only purpose in the game is to make it to the next level. They are missing the whole point of the game. Thanks for letting me talk about how I feel. Great job on your 100th issue by the way.
