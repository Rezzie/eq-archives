<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, time for a hard question...I'm a follower of Veeshan (Well, only in my heart...My Wizard Guildmaster wouldn't let me attend the church..Could be why his lab vanished in that fire...), and would like to visit Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen, WITHOUT being eaten... Do you know of any way to convince either of these mighty Dragons that I truly wish them no harm, and would be happy to add to their treasury, if allowed to leave with the same number of bodyparts I began the day with?
<br>
Poofe Farsteppe Champion of Chaos,   Defender of Dragonkind,     Officer of the Keepers of the Blood
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, have tried to elicit a friendly response from Lady Vox now and again as personally I think it could be quite interesting to spend an afternoon taking tea with her and would jump at the opportunity.   My notes, unfortunately, were all returned to me as ashes!  Thus, as far as I know,  none of these evil dragons is the least bit interested in any visitors except as welcome opportunities to expend a little extra steam on tidbits for dinner.  For now, I think it's best to plan on keeping your coins in your bank and your body parts where they belong.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to know how does it work on the pvp server and the pvp team server. What are the rules, how does it work? Is it a good simulation of reality or is it just a competition server and not a real Everquest server?  Also if I want to play in a world where almost everything is possible (like being ambushed by a group of thief when I would be traveling through the woods), what server should I take? And does role playing actually exist on the pvp server? 
<br>
Bragador
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential difference between the pvp servers and the pvp team servers is that on the first, each player can kill any other player, and on the second, each race  team can kill members of any other team but their own.   All three of the pvp servers are definitely full Everquest servers but with added possibilities.  The essential rules of play for the pvp servers are similar to the other servers but carry special provisions for corpse retrievals, corpse looting, pvp tactics, etc.  I'm not sure what you mean by a good simulation of reality though.  All EQ servers have the same npc interaction so the essential framework of the world doesn't change from server to server.  However, because guilds and groups of friends or teams on the pvp servers can create situations like thieves jumping out from behind trees in a way that the players on the non-pvp servers cannot, it seems like a fair answer to your question about which server you should play on to point to the pvp or pvp teams servers as the most likely to satisfy your interests.  I have heard of an enormous amount of roleplay occurring on Rallos Zek, the pvp server.  My guess is that the team servers would  have similar opportunities but I haven't heard as much about them.   However, I wouldn't give up on roleplay on the regular servers either.  Even with the littlest newbie, roleplaying can occur anytime people meet up who are really "being" their characters.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, I'm new to this sort of thing but I just have a favor more than a question. I was just wondering what server you play in or if you  could give me a good server name. I'm also looking to group quickly in EQ. Please help!  
<br>
Kallon
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry you had to wait an entire week but I'll try to give a helpful answer here.  First, I play on Veeshan mostly although I have a couple of baby characters on other servers for fun too.  Second, I can suggest several servers but sometimes its good to create newbie characters on more than one server and just see if you feel a different atmosphere or not.  Also, if you are from a non-English speaking country you might want to go to the server that has a high population of players that speak the same language you do.  For instance, Veeshan has a lot of Japanese players and Solusek Ro has a lot of German speaking players.  The above factors aside, however, I would suggest that you consider playing on the newest servers, The Nameless and The Tribunal, as I think you would find more people at lower levels to group with.  As for grouping in general, I'd suggest you go to the newbie area of whichever race/class combination you choose and simply shout for a group.  It helps to be a friendly and fair player.  Also, find some nice higher levels to bug for information and advice as they may have suggestions on where to go to find groups too.  I wish you luck and hope you have a great time playing.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I  have the game but don't know where to go to play the game.  Please help!! 
<br>
Ark Knight
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm, ok I'm not entirely sure what you are asking so if I give too much information (a bardly habit by the way), please forgive me.  I'll start by assuming you have the box open and have the game installed and there is now an Everquest shield icon on your desktop.  Before you do anything else, go into the Everquest folder and find the tutorial file and do it.  It will make playing the game soooooo much easier when you actually get there.  After you do the tutorial, keep your number key from the box in front of you as you log into Everquest.  Once you have clicked play online and you  "agree" to the rules, you should find yourself at a screen that has an accounts button on it.  You click on the accounts button and then on the button that says "Create New Account"  -- this should take you through the steps to get your number key recognized, give your credit card information and get set up.  Once you are all set up and confirmed, then you log onto Everquest, give your password on the connect screen and you'll find yourself at a screen with a bunch of options at the bottom.  You can check out chat if you wish, but if you want to get playing, click on "play" and it will take you to a scroll-down list of the servers you can play on.  The "Zek" servers are player killing servers (see explanation in the answer above and earlier issues of EQ Express) while all the others are regular servers.   (See the question above for more information on servers too!)  You then click on the server you would like to play on (each has exactly the same game world), and then when your choice is highlighted, you click on "Enter Everquest".  Very shortly you should see the Everquest lady appear, hear some music, and soon be on the character creation screen.  Click on create a character, pick your race and face, your class, select your stats  and a name and maybe a god, and you're on your way into your first play session.  Once you are in the game, begin to explore and don't hesitate to ask for help from passersby.  I hope I didn't misunderstand your question and that you find this helpful.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was trying to make some pickled gator and pickled lizard after a long stay at Cazic Thule but I couldn't find the necessary jar to make them. Can you give me any clue as to what jar I need to use? Thanks 
<br>
Lest Levinor
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I'm not averse to gourmet oddities on occasion, what in heaven's name would anyone want with pickled gator and pickled lizard?   I would hope you are not considering them as comestibles?  Well, regardless of what you may or may not be choosing to eat, I have only been able to ascertain that there is a possibility that the ogre merchant near the gates of Freeport has the pickles for sale which might save you some effort in trying to make them.  However, if you are still pursuing a jar, you might want to find a friendly potter and see if pickling jars are in his or her repertoire.  I'm sorry I don't really have more information for you.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Faboo need help, me wonder if u kno of eny troll shadowknights dat follow Cazic Thule ever make it in dat city of Qeynos?  Me got 50 gnoll tooths and got nathin to do wit dem :(  Hope u say yes so dat me kan barsh GNoll puppies till me kan get in city.  Dankie for help! 
<br>
Faboo
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Pillars of Wisdom were unanimous in stating that there is definitely hope that some day you will find yourself within the walls of Qeynos and still alive.  However, in order to travel inside the gates of that great city, you'll need to first spend an enormously long time in Blackburrow ridding the area of gnolls.  While it might seem that 50 gnoll tooths are plenty, you'll have to practice counting a lot higher than the teachers in troll counting school had you go.  As one of the Pillars said, "He'll have to have more like 300 gnoll teeth to think about going to Qeynos."  If counting that high is hard for trolls, just keep barshing those gnolls, not worrying about the numbers, and eventually one day you too will see the wonders of Qeynos.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a poor magician wandering the lands of Norrath and in my early years, I try to beg some coppers to people of my kind, but the Dark Elves don't seem to appreciate my efforts. I gain some skill from my guild trainer, but never managed to gain some money. And lately, my practice didn't seem to improve anymore. I was in Befallen and tried to beg some coppers from the necro neophytes who roam in the place. My skill increase at last, but I still can't gain some money from the people I meet. The kingdom of Vallon Zek is a place of war, blood and need, so I'd like to get some advice about how I can make a living as a beggar.
<br>
Sooron - Magician of Neriak - Follower of Innoruuk
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What Innoruuk might say about one of his own begging, I'm not sure.  I do know I wouldn't want to be around if he decided to comment on the process.  I suppose it is possible that his evil energies hinder your way but as I really know little of the Hated One, I won't try to guess.  However, you did ask me how you could make a living as a beggar and I can only say that I think probably at best you are unwise to try and at worst, stark raving mad maybe.  Hmmm, my goodness I am being judgmental there and that's not very bardly.  Ok, ahem, cough cough, truthfully, I think if you could follow your begging calling among pc's of your own race team (avoiding all others who would be much more interested in killing you than helping you), that adequate wealth might be more easily won than from begging from the npcs.  I'm so very sorry to discourage you but as far as I know, every copper won by even a skilled beggar is a rarity.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail Ox....whatever, I am Dwan the Paladin of Veeshan...I'm a dwarf and I'm wondering WHO of the small races (gnomes, Dwarves, Halflngs) are the best, smartest, best looking, quickest....etc....?? 
<br>
Dwan of Veeshan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ummm is this a trick question or one merely to get me bombarded with letters from lobbying representatives of all the races I didn't choose as best, smartest, best looking or quickest?  I will tell you what I like best about each of them though.  Gnomes move in the cutest way and those little bald heads, quirky ears, and questioning eyes make them irresistible to me.  Dwarves, of course, have the most beautiful beards, stocky round warm arms, and endearing deep eyes that melt my heart like the Kaladim fires melt gold.  Halflings definitely have their own earthy charm and I have never met one I didn't like instantly.  Despite their smallishness, halflings have a gift of friendship and a spirit of curious adventure that sets them apart from the other little ones.  So, there, you see?  I can't choose which are best or smartest, etc.; they're all great and the world of Norrath is richer for them all.  Now, about those warm dwarvish arms . . . . !  (Winks at you as she runs on to the next question and points out that her name is Nepenthia.  Nep for short! ) 
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I recently found this nice little millinery shop outside the gates of Freeport...  It's run by a gnome named Ping Fuzzlecutter out of his wagon.  Anyway, he sells wigs there, and I bought a "Wild One Wig," just for the sake of splurging.  But, he's also got something called Fuzzlecutter Formula 5000, and I can't for the life of my figure out what it does.  It's stackable, comes in bottles...  Would you happen to know?  Thanks.
<br>
Shilososhi Sidhe, Ranger of Tunare of the Perpetual Ninth Circle, Erollisi Marr
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the Pillars of Wisdom, particularly Sylvos, came through with an answer for you.  The Fuzzlecutter Formula 5000 is for the rain caller quest and if you intend to do it, you might want to ask Ping to make sure he has plenty of bottles in store.  I'm just thankful it didn't turn out to be some bardic guzzle for wornout throats or something.  From its name, I can only imagine that the Formula tastes really really bad.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the best pet for a mage?  And what are the stats of the elementals at different levels?  And which is the best elemental to use when: traveling; in dungeons; general.  I think this info will help mages everywhere. Thanks. 
<br>
Soladiel
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This took a bit of searching but somewhere out there I did come across a piece written by the Archmage of Norrath, himself, about magicians, with some very clear comments on their pets. (I apologize for not noting the site cite for you, but I don't have it now.)  The best pet for a mage will depend on what you want to accomplish with your pet, what kind of a fight you are in, and what kind of a group you have.  The Archmage pointed out (if I got this right out of all the magical mumbojumbo) that the earth elemental can take a lot of damage because of high hitpoints but cannot deal much out, the fire elemental will do the most damage but will need major defense as it doesn't have as many hitpoints; the air elemental is useful in certain situations but usually will die fast; and the water elemental is the most balanced of all four.  Moving on to the stats -- basically as the magician advances to each new circle, his or her elementals will increase in abilities as well.  I believe the lower level elementals even have diminutive names like elementalkin or some such, so you can distinguish among them.  As to which elemental to use when, well, hmm, even the Pillars of Wisdom didn't want to touch this one.   I think the best answer is to choose the one that can best accomplish your goals for that place.  Which takes us back to the beginning of this exercise in circular thinking.  Giggle, wish I was of more help but really, you might want to charm a high level magician and get more detailed and helpful advice.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi there, I must say that I enjoy reading your Q & A very much. I find your writing style to be very unique, intelligent, and witty.   Now, onto the question. Is double attack and dual wield not capped liked other skills. By that I mean, with most skills they only go up 5 or sometimes 3 or 4 per level. So a level 20 Necro could not have their meditate skill past 105. I've noticed that dual wield and double attack don't cap like this and that a level 20 Warrior could possibly have both skills at 120. Am I imagining things or is this true? I am also curious as to what level you are.  Thanks, Keep up the great work!
<br>
Kahr Crimsonblood
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh thank you for your kind words and encouragement.  I'm really glad you enjoy EQ Express and the Q&A.  Now to your questions, of which I will answer the last first.  I'm level 24 bard, better at chatting than at smiting at the moment, but hoping to begin increasing my bardly skills again soon.  As for your double attack and dual wield skills, here is the explanation some of the Pillars of Wisdom have passed along:  All the melee classes do have a cap on their skills in double attack and dual wield and all can gain a limited number of skill points per level.  However the number of skill points per level gained will vary among the melee classes with rangers getting the fewest and monks getting the most.  I believe, but am not sure that these skills are gained at an even rate, so at level 25 a warrior would have about half the skill points of a level 50.   Thus if a warrior could have 250 skill points, you'd expect to see a level 25 warrior with 125 points.  Since I know more about tavern songs than about warrior skills, I'm afraid this answer is a little sketchy, but still, I hope it helps.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings!  I was wondering if you know whether or not we will be able to create a Lizard Man Bard on Kunark when the expansion pack becomes available? 
<br>
Gnik
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, there has been no announcement as to any classes that the Lizzies can play except for monk.  However, go take a look at the <a href="../credits/shots.htm">screenshot</a> of the lizard man we have on EQ Express and tell me honestly if you can see him with a mandolin singing of a lost true love.  Hmmm, well bards don't only have to play genteel instruments.  Maybe he would  play an enormous kettle drum and bombard the area with musically oriented hisses about lost true dinners?  Hmm, thinking about it, a lizard one-man-band might be quite successful on tour.  I guess we'll have to wait and see whether such an artist will exist.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;HI!  First a request.  I wish that a search engine was implemented so one could wade through the TON of great information here.  And a question.  I constantly see the great damage done to those evil monsters by my fellow adventurers.  I witnessed the great warrior Jena dish out a tasty 107 damage last night.  I'm humbled and troubled by this, since my damage is a tiny fraction of this.  Over time, my weapons have certainly improved. I wield Short Sword of Morin (YES, I'm a RANGER, 24th circle), and PGT. My strength is a natural 83 and is enhanced at 96.  Yet, my damage per hit is still 13-15, slice, dice , or kick.   Also, I miss often which is very frustrating.   What is the problem!  How can one improve on damage done, and chance to hit?  Thanks!
<br>
Naeen, E'ci.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your idea of a search engine is a good one and while I don't think we can do that here yet, our beloved editors have asked me to come up with a FAQ-type article that could be continuously posted to answer the most commonly asked questions.  I will try to do that reasonably soon.  In the meantime, let's talk about you!  I did take the information you gave me to the Pillars of Wisdom, particularly Tagad and Sylvos, who narrowed the answer to your question about improvement down to two words:  dexterity and strength.  They both felt that for your level and the weapons you have you are doing about average and could improve if you concentrate on increasing your damage and your strength until you get higher levels and higher damage weapons.  Sylvos recommended that you also get a trueshot bow and get your archery skill up as he says you'll be amazed with what you can do with it.   Finally, my recommendation is to take a bard along and get some music going to help too!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna know some name and effect of rare magician spells.  I thank thee. 
<br>
Eldhar
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm very sorry not to be able to answer your question here.  Sometimes it is a very fine line to walk between giving answers that are spoilers and answers that are helpful but don't give away too much information.  So I'm going to suggest two possibilities for you depending on which style of play you like best.  If you really want to know all the details before you play a magician and level him or her up to high levels, then there are spoiler sites out there on the net you can go to visit.  You'll find the sites have charts and articles on all aspects of being a magician including spell information.  However, if you want to discover the world as you go along, as would a magician who only existed in Norrath, then I'd recommend becoming sociable with others of your class who are maybe 5 or 10 levels ahead of you.  That way, as you gain circles, you can ask for advice on which spells are most useful and also gain a better understanding of how and when to use them.  Who knows?   You might even be invited to join groups and work with higher level magicians to learn both the zones and the mage skills.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In reference to your comment about binding. I am a 35 necro and have been playing, as you, since beta. Any class that has the spell "bind affinity" can cast it either on themselves OR on other players. There is no bind spell that only works on the caster. This spell can be cast on the caster in ANY location. This spell can only be cast on others within a group AND only in "town zones" of which Highhold and Gr. Faydark are considered "town zones". Both of these zones are "open" zones for binding due to 1. Kelethin and 2. HighKeep. The message you receive with a successful binding is....you feel yourself bind to the area"....for a unsuccessful binding you receive following message....."you do not feel an affinity for this area"...  If you are not grouped with the person binding/being bound you will see the statement "so and so tries to cast a spell on you but you are protected". As you state there IS a very rare bug that a bind will not actually hold even though you received the proper confirmation message.  As for wisdom...Wisdom is primary for mana for hybrid types (Pal, Cler, Druid etc.) Wisdom also reduces failures with trade skills, lowers spell fizzles, it does not affect the npc's spell resistance nor does it affect your resisting a spell cast on you.  You people are doing an OUTSTANDING job with this wonderful parchment. Adding great variety to the drab life in Norrath since the (yuck) bards who deliver the mail just can't seem to stay alive long enough to do so. (sorry :( But I am a Necro and darkelf to boot :P  )I would like to thank you for posting that tidbit about the corpses not affecting the reappearance of their others. Once again, I wish ye well and pleasant journeys, though ye be a bard. Sincerely,
<br>
Zuriak
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your clear and step-by-step explanation of binding.  I found it really helpful and appreciate your taking the time to write in with it.  I'm glad you like EQ Express and thank you for reading and responding with such helpful information and insights.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as to bindable non-cities, it could be argued that HighHold Pass is a non-city area. Also, the Keep itself is unique in that you can bind in there, and there is an intense amount of fighting do be done in there as well.
<br>
Malakh
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing in about HighHold Pass.  I'd totally forgotten about it being a bind spot.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the "When do monk's hit magical" question in EQX 100 the answer is this:  never.  A monk's hand-to-hand hits do not become magical at any level.  On the other hand, the "special" attacks like round kick, tiger claw and the rest are always magical, so it is possible that a level 12 monk would have enough hps to kill a wisp with tiger claw only.  This is unnecessary, though, because monk attacks can become magical with the right equipment.  Any magical gloves render the normal monk attacks magical attacks.  Netted, mesh, woven and wu's (there may be more) gloves all render monk punches magical.  Netted are the cheapest, but any magic gloves will pay for themselves with the first greater lightstone, and then continue paying hundreds of times over, literally.
<br>
Jim Eckert
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm tired of this. I'm going to clear this up once and for all to the best of my ability. Here goes: First, monks do NOT get magical punches until higher levels. What level? I don't know. I also point out the word PUNCH. Strike is a secondary attack. Not considered a punch. All secondary attacks (for monks, anyway) after kick are magical. I'm not sure about round kick. Ask someone else. Until higher levels, magic gloves are needed for magical punches. I once again point out the word PUNCH. Magical secondary attacks do not require magical gloves. Thank you. I hope this clarifies any other misconceptions 
<br>
Inquis
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to you both for clarifying the different types of attacks and which ones are naturally magic and which are not.  I appreciate your letters.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is sorta a question and clarification.  In issue 101, you had a question from a sk ogre, complaining about paladin Holy Swords. Well, to set everyone straight, paladin only swords are the TOUGHEST weapons to get (Send flames to : rkosbab@wcnet.org).  If you think you sks get your butts whipped by froggies and doggies, you should put up with what we paladins have to go thru. Yeah, you may not like going deep into dungeons, but it sure beats running from one side of a continent to the other side of another continent.  Heck, for the Soulfire alone, we have to travel to Mistmoore, kill a lvl 45+ spawn there, back to Freeport, kill the lvl 45+ guard (which btw makes us KOS to all Freeport guards),  and then head to the newly revamped paw, and find a fellow trapped paladin in there. And that's only the soulfire quest. I could go on and on, hell, there is a holy sword that you have to be low to mid 20s to get, and for that level it sucks, but its hell to get.  Hehe, I guess the paladins' quests are not all the glorious fun they are cracked up to be.  :)  Ah, now that I got that off my chest, I have a question about lvls of 2 spawns ( go figure, its to the Holy Parsan of the underfoot quest ( the mid 20 blade I mentioned above) ) the 2 spawns are the druids in Rathe Mtns. and the second is the final part of the quest a Undead orc skelly called Captain Kupla ( I think that's his name) thanks for your help :) 
<br>
Rombus Skyblade
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks so much for the paladin perspective.  You need to find a nice speedy bard to help you race from place to place!  As to the levels of the spawns you mention, I'm sorry but I don't know them and didn't find anyone who knew their levels.  You might want to check around and talk to players who have done the quest and see if they can help there.  Good luck and thanks again for writing.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail and well met, half-breed, In regard to the Mother-loving cleric that wrote in about clerics and the different races aptitude for the cleric, there were a few things I noted that seemed...out of place.  Firstly, you said if you were one of the Chosen Children of the Father to be prepared to be encumbered greatly... The Children of the Father are stronger naturally then your race, and I myself have yet to be encumbered. (Bronze everything, Steel Breastplate, Skull shaped barbute (no I didn't twink, someone gave me this cleaning out their bank account cause they were quitting the game))  AS for your "excessive mana" again your impotent Mother-goddess has left you blind, as from what I've found Wisdom doesn't affect mana all that much, and even with less Wisdom, if you cast wisely, you'll find you have all the mana you need with a 118 Wisdom like myself.  Thank you for your "important" time half-breed.  I needed to clear things up for that Pale skinned surface dwelling Mother-lover. 
<br>
Vaeryl D'Toroth
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My goodness, I thank you for writing to clear things up but find I must disagree with you quite a bit.  Of course, given our relative vantage points, I suppose it would be exceedingly strange if I agreed with you!  However, I think despite your abilities to wear heavy accoutrements, you'll find that half-elves are still generally stronger than those of your tint.  Also, I think someone steered you down the wrong river on the wisdom issue.  One of my Pillars of Wisdom, a cleric now at the 49th level, simply shrugged and suggested that if you think wisdom is of little use you will never be able to experience the beauty of casting a resurrect spell and using only one bubble of mana to do so.  I think you might find that even pale skinned surface dwelling mother-lovers have some err wisdom to offer you.  (Ohhh bad pun!)
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess who, Nep.  It's me again, Aalon.  This is like the 10th week in a row I have sent something in.  First off, I applied for a guide at that website that Aenaneb mentioned.  It took them 2 months to reply.  Although this was about the 10th week of EverQuest, you get the point :)
Also, this is a question not related to the game, but to this website.  Do I, or anyone else, have permission to use the graphics published on this website?  For example, on the front page under "Fit to print", could I use that lizard screenshot for something else?  Thanks!-

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah my friend Ardel, that is high praise indeed from you and I appreciate you taking the time to write.  To anyone on Veeshan who has yet to meet Ardel, rest assured you are in for a treat when you do as she is one of the most charming wizards I have ever met and is always ready to listen to a bard's story or song and then maybe exchange one of her own.  Thank you for writing.
