But Orm got out of my sight and I had to rest.  As soon as I stopped I heard it
behind me.  All I could do was pray and cast a quick spell.  I never even turned
around to face it.  I didn’t have the time.  I guess my spell scared it off, or it
did not like the way I taste," her smile hurt me, for I knew that she would never
smile again.
<br><br>
"I saw the creature, I know what it is.  Please, tell him that I know the secret.
I know how to destroy it.  Tell him.  He’ll be at the inn, the Red…"

And so it was her last wish that I tell her brother, Orm, how to defeat the beast.
Yet she had not managed to tell me how.  She did not live long enough to tell me what
it was.  But I suspected that I knew.  There were rumors amongst the bards that there
was a man-wolf in town.  And tonight the moon was full.  If the lore was correct, I
might know how to defeat it.  So I would carry out her wish.
<br><br>
I was terrified the entire time that I traveled the well lit streets to the Red
Ferret.  The meager lamps would not keep this creature at bay.  And I had her blood
on me, it would recognize the scent.

There he was, standing in front of the inn, under the lamp.  Perhaps he thought the
light might keep him safe.  Or perhaps he had just given up.  Perhaps he already knew
that his sister lay dead in an alley and that he had no reason to further battle the
Wolf.  I knew that it was within me to inspire him to fight, as was his sisters wish.
<br><br>
I strode closer, finally feeling that I had a chance to help that poor girl, even if
I could not save her life.  Even though I never knew her name.  But my stride
faltered as I drew near enough to see his face clearly in the lamplight.  Had she not
said that her brother had green eyes?  I stopped walking.  And as I did so, the man
grinned, a feral and toothy grin.
<br><br>
And the entire city would hear him howling.
