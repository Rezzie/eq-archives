Hoi there! Lrets D'pearl here and finally back from vacation. Boy, do I have some stories for ye! But first lemme bring ye up to speed on the newest craze that seems to be sweeping across the lands lately. With the turn of the millennium just around the corner it seems that stories of apocalyptic catastrophes and other beliefs have become a dime a dozen lately. As most of you may know the most popular theory bouncing around lately is that Innoruuk has somehow managed to ally himself with a Demonic Insect Monster known as Waa-yee TOO Kay who will come to ravage the lands at midnight of the last night of this year. Now we know this is patently ridiculous, yet the ever diligent and careful priests of Tunare have made sure, just in case, and left kegs of bug spray on every corner of every major street in every major population center ... just in case :) 
<br><br>
In any case .. back to me story! It seems that a new theory has popped up out in the wilds and is gathering great popularity for reasons unknown. It seems that some followers of Karana have received a vision that holy fires and lightning will cleanse the lands at the turn of the millennium and the only way to protect oneself from this is to purify the body of all unclean and worldly influences and become ONE with nature.

<em>A new pseudo-religion believes that all creatures must purify themselves of all impurities by LITERALLY becoming one with nature</em>
<br><br>
What this means .. I have no idea, but you may have seen these fanatics in ye'r travels and observed as people and creatures try to LITERALLY become one with nature by embedding themselves into trees and boulders and what not. To date, Karana has not been available to comment. HOWEVER, further investigation has turned up information that this may all be some sort of colossal prank started by the unkempt druids, and was started with judicious use of a Treeform spell.

<em>Amazingly this truly bizarre belief has created a large and strong following of fanatics</em>
