<b>Part Nineteen</b>


<br><br>


      After all the time Gwyn had spent staring at the gates and wondering how he was to get out of Freeport, all it took was a mild disguise and an escort of Paladins to get him through the ranks of the Militia on duty at the West Gate.  They went through with nothing more than a few growled curses directed at them.  The Paladins rode past the grubby Militiamen with heads held high, plate armor clanking, and eyes forward.  Gwyn, encased in full Paladin plate, did his best to imitate their hauteur and poise.  Still, he was sweating rivers by the time the Gate was left behind.
<br><br>
   His sister's trail was four days cold by the time they left the city, but nonetheless, they were able to track her progress.  A much better sketch, drawn from Gwyn's description, and the goodwill toward Paladins that abounded around Freeport got them as far as an inn called The Long Man.  People there were vague in the extreme, but Gwyn gathered that Kinory, now accompanied by two other Rogues, the half-elf that had left the city with her, and a full Wood elf man, had been attacked by a party of men, and had fled in the middle of the night.  From there, though the Rogues had been gone less than two days, the trail went dead.  
<br><br>
   They spent the night at The Long Man, eating in a private dining room and discussing how best to proceed.   The Paladins wanted to press on, figuring that they could pick up the trail later.  
<br><br>
   "Everything seems to point to them running to the western coast.  We should keep on as we have.  Perhaps go through Highhold instead of Rivervale.  Rogues would be more likely to take that route, would they not?"
<br><br>
   Gwyn dragged a hand through his hair in frustration.
<br><br>
   "Highhold is a bandit stronghold, Katryn," he explained patiently to the young woman.  "They have no great liking for city Rogues, and less still for Paladins.  The shoestring of Volunteers may be willing to help us, but they have no real power.  They barely control Highpass Hold, much less the Pass itself.  Not to mention orcs, gnolls, and who knows what else that has taken up residence there.  No," he shook his head,  "if my sister and her party go through there, we must give them up for lost.  The best we can do is try to cut them off before they gain Kithikor pass.  If they are going cross country, they may still be slogging through the forests."  He turned his gaze to the darkened window.  "These are not the forests she is used to.  I remember them well."  He paused, lost in thought.
<br><br>
   "Perhaps, then, our best course is to keep to the road until Unrest, then cut across to Lynemere Lake.  From there, it is mostly open to the Pass.  We can make better time, and hopefully beat them…"
<br><br>
   Gwyn slammed his hand down on the table.  The other three jumped, and Dareed snatched at his overturned wine cup, giving Gwyn a sour look.  He paid no attention.
<br><br>
   "The forest!" he exclaimed.  "Of course.  They must have been found by the Woodward, if they went cross-country from here.  Their path would cut directly across her territory."
<br><br>
   "The…Woodward, Gwyn?"  Sevael kept her voice carefully neutral.  "You mean Druids."
<br><br>
   "Yes.  We can ask them for help.  Detain Kin and the others, maybe."
<br><br>
   "Gwyn," said Dareed, "the Druids of these woods are unlikely to help anyone do anything.  Tunare has become a most cautious god of late.  If anything, Kinory is hanging by the heels somewhere, on trial for burning unfallen wood."
<br><br>
   Gwyn's lips thinned.  "Don't repeat those spurious rumors to me.  I lived among the Woodward for three months.  Besides which, Kinory knows too much to disrespect the Mother in her lands.  My worry is that the Druids may help them steal a march on us.  We have to contact them."
<br><br>
   "You are the leader of this expedition, Gwyn," said Dareed stiffly.  "But I must formally protest."
<br><br>
    "Noted," said Gwyn, equally polite.  "And ignored.  We will leave the road tomorrow and strike into the woods.  It won't be necessary to find the Druids.  They'll find us, I'm sure.  Dismissed."
