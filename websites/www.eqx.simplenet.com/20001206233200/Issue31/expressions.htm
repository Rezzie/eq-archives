<em>"I have been amazed at the anti-anti-power gaming sentiment that has been floating around EQ. I read guild pages (Orc guild pages mind you) that stated killing someone is not permitted without extreme provocation.  Isn't that strange? Are we, as role-players, going to throw ourselves so far from the PK/Powergamer side that we lose well....for lack of a better word...our nuts?  Orc are mean SOBs, and they hate humans to the point of K.O.S. (if JRR Tolkein is your bible..) But now it seems there's no way to justify anything evil anymore.....Well, just a thought :)"</em>

To the best of my knowledge, orcs are not a race available for players to play, but the point still stands.  In the wake of Ultima Online there has been a great movement by those who were disappointed in UO's roleplaying-lite, slaughter-heavy environment.  This movement is generally a belief that a PKer is someone who can not roleplay.  Now that I've tossed out a bunch of terms which may be unfamiliar to some, let me put some of my own definitions to them, as well as to some terms I have not yet mentioned.
<br><br>
PK (Player Killer):  An individual who attacks other players.  That's the polite and very general definition.  What you'll find most people referring to when they say PKer, is this… An individual who preys on weaker beginning characters in order to bolster his own statistics and prove his manhood to himself (Because the world could care less).
<br><br>
UO (Ultima Online):  Predecessor of EverQuest, generally expected to be a good roleplaying environment.  Also known as *cough* and as "that other game".  The tremendous quantity of PKers waiting for the newbies to appear so they could slaughter said newbies brought expectations crashing back to earth.
<br><br>
Role-Playing:  To play the part of a fictional character, reacting to the environment and stimuli as if you were that character.  My definition.  Simple, really.
<br><br>
The Switch:  Ah, the switch.  Sony's EverQuest allows one to define if other Players are able to attack the character or not.  Referred to here as "switch protected" or "switch unprotected".
<br><br>
PC (Player Character):  A character which is operated by a player.
<br><br>
NPC (Non-Player Character):  Any character not operated by a player.
<br><br>
Our terminology in place, let the diatribe begin!
<br><br>
Essentially, there are many arguments about the "realism" of the switch and its effect of the continuity of the game, but I will do my best to stay away from this.  For this is a discussion of Role-playing.
<br><br>
What has essentially happened in some cases, as pointed out by Danyael above, is that the community of roleplayers who became disenchanted with Ultima Online have come clamoring for EverQuest, and in creation of their guilds, have decided to declare that they are "Non-PVP", "Non-PK" or Switch Protected.  They intend that their guild members do not run about the countryside preying on the weak, but instead dedicate themselves to being the most realistic Trolls, Ogres, etc., that they can be!
<br><br>
Do you see the problem yet?
<br><br>
What essentially is a Troll?  We'll ignore the Websters definition this time, since they are non-roleplayers.  Essentially Trolls have come to be large, ugly, often stupid humanoid creatures who are ruthlessly aggressive or effortlessly cruel.
<br><br>
So now you've founded a league of Switch-Protected folks.  You decide the membership should only be trolls.  I could understand a passive troll or two, but an entire guild?  The same thought should be put into deciding whether your individual character is switch protected.  Some good determining factors in choosing and "unprotected" character are these:
<br><br>
1) You are playing a typically brutal race and prefer your character follow some of its racial stereotypes. The racial descriptions for the game are there for a reason…basically it's so that we can all get a feel for what we'll be encountering.  But if you want to play a character that is somewhat of a fluke, there's no crime in that.
<br><br>
2) You intend to travel with other un-switched individuals.  Now this is the reason that guilds list their preference for PK and Non-PK members.  It has been stated that there are certain actions that will alter the status of one's switch.  An example given of this is when you an unswitched character heals a switched character.  He subsequently becomes switched as well.  Else you could have one character stand back and be safe from attack and simply heal his allies while they fight, yet he himself could not be hurt because he's protected by the switch.
<br><br>
Worse yet.  You are protected, you are a healer, yet you won't heal your allies because if you do your switch will change.  So they die.  This I think is the nightmare of some guilds.
<br><br>
I'm not saying that it is not a good thing to state up front to potential members of a guild that you will only accept characters of a particular switch status.  Quite the contrary.
<br><br>
The switch is not only particular to some races, but professions as well.  Ever heard of a barbarian that wouldn't fight another individual in a bar?  Or a Shadow Knight who wasn't willing to kill just about anything he came across?
<br><br>
What I am saying is that it is necessary to take into account the racial and class biases of the type of character you are making when it comes time to set its switch position.
