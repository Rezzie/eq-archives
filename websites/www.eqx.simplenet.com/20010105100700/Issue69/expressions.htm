Immersiveness. Complete conscious and subconscious immersiveness. I often have dreams about games about which I'm currently obsessing. Diablo, Baldur's Gate and Starcraft have been recently invading my sleep. However, none of those games were more than pixellated recreations of what appeared on the screen in front of me hours before falling into slumber. 
<br><br>
With EverQuest, things are different. Almost every night I have wonderful, realistic fantasy dreams, very colorful and full of adventure, interesting and exciting characters and, of course, me. Funny, I'm never sure exactly WHAT character I'm supposed to be. I'm just me, the first-person, experiencing numerous adventures. My journeys take me to Norrath and beyond. I am sometimes the master of arcane lore and elemental powers, and sometimes I am the shadows' friend, sneaking my way around countless enemies to discover key information to help save the world... or at least further my cause. 
<br><br>
The wild & amazing thing about these dreams is that they're not at all what I see on the screen as I'm playing The Game and most certainly developing some new kind of repetitive stress disorder, bashing and casting spells upon numerous enemy creatures in my 15" version of the World. In my dreams, the world of Norrath is created in my imagination. Textures and colors, creatures and fellow travelers have an even greater complexity and depth than current technology can bring to my computer screen. In my dreams, my adventures in Norrath ARE real life! 
<br><br>
Everyone who has played the game from its fledgling stages to the end of beta, and everyone who will pick it up again or for the first time after release will understand how wonderful Norrath is within the confines of a 300 MHz computer with even a medium-quality monitor and perhaps middle-of-the-road audio. We'll know the joys and perhaps the ennui of fighting tons of bats and rats to achieve 5th level Yet Again. But what makes this a truly unique, fascinating, compelling game for me is the place it has helped me carve in my own imagination, a place I return to night after night in dreams I'd love to keep forever, dreams that take me back to the time when I was a student and had the luxury of hours to spend in books of fantastical worlds. And, once the books were read, I would enjoy hours of contemplation of those places. Hours when I would write about my own secret magick and hidden lands full of heroes. 
<br><br>
Thank Brell (Mellia the Gnome's adoptive parents are Dwarves!) for Verant, Red Eye, Sony... For Brad and everyone else who has been so committed to opening up this portal to their world. They have shown me a path to a world of my own!</em>
<br><br>
Thank you for this wonderful testament to one of the primary reasons EverQuest is so fun. There is no doubt that the world of Norrath is quite immersive. The detailed 3D environment and the interaction between scores of different PCs and NPCs makes this a very believable atmosphere. There isn't much more I can say in addition to what Mellia has said. However, I would like to use this to support a response to another submission:

I'm afraid I must disagree with the EQ community's opposition to spoilers. Yes, UO where everything was mapped by the end of Beta had its problems, but opposing spoilers neglects a basic element of human nature. Mainly to explore new territory and then share your findings with others. It should come as no surprise that a game like EQ will result in spoilers real life has given us many spoilers. From medieval bestiaries to maps of the globe man seeks to brake new ground and then share his story with others. Something can only be done the first time by one person. As the act gets repeated it WILL be recorded. It is information people want to know and it is human nature to give it to them. No static world can ever sate the human desire for knowledge. If like UO everything at release is basically the way it will always be it is only a matter of time before every corner of the world is explored, every sight seen by many people and every piece of information recorded. Online games have such a short history behind them but it clearly shows that players will band together and pool their knowledge to understand their world. How many of you remember the Halloween quest in UO where the riddle was solved not by one person but by hundred of people traveling the world, gathering data, posting it to the UO Vault and finally putting their heads together to interpret what they found. This is the true face of online gaming, giving up a small part of your knowledge to gain a view of the whole. There may be more minor quests then can ever be recorded but I assure you that the great mysteries of the world will draw a group of cooperative seekers and when they find truth the whole world will know it.</em>
<br><br>
I would be willing to bet that if players had traveled the world of UO and met each other in the villages, towns, and other gathering spots to share knowledge while in-character, that the solution to the quest would have been a much more enjoyable and heralded event. Recall that, after an online protest in UO involving masses of players storming the castle, that Origin lauded it as a testament to their online world. They were happy that their environment provided the mechanisms for people to act (and resolve?) conflicts and challenges completely within the game itself. 
<br><br>
Spoiler sites are completely out of character, no doubt about it. Any time you need to leave the game and surf the web, you lose the immersive aspect of the game. If it merely becomes an "online game" rather than a "virtual world", then you have already degraded the potential of EverQuest. EverQuest Express, along with a handful of other founding EQ web sites, were asked to cooperate with Verant to maintain this aspect of the game by not posting spoilers and turning it into a powergaming community. Instead, we chose to promote role playing and personal exploration of all things that can be discovered. The world of Norrath is very rich in history, background, quests, and events. It would be a shame to spoil the enjoyment a player can get out of an event by posting it on the web and demonstrating that their discovery was known by millions before they ever logged on. 
<br><br>
However, you bring up a great issue about gaining fame for being the first to accomplish a task. It is a valid, interesting, and fun aspect of role playing and adventuring to boast about your feats. Heroes should be made of the first players to slay the famed red dragon. How can this be accomplished without posting detailed step-by-step instructions with screenshots? The answer to the question is surprisingly obvious. How was this accomplished in the days of yore? Bards would travel the land, telling stories that they had heard and embellishing things to sound even better than they were. Books were written, copied, and transcribed to be stored in libraries, where those who truly wished to duplicate their actions would spend hours poring over tomes to extract clues and details. 
<br><br>
You can do much of the same. Tell your tales to passing bards, and hopefully they will role play their class and pass the stories along to others they meet. In early development, Brad mentioned there were plans to allow writing books in the game, and allowing these to be stored in libraries. If this is possible, or being worked on, this would be a wonderful way of making our accomplishments known to everyone in a permanent fashion, and ensure that we would live in the history of the game itself. If this was not implemented, then the developers should take heed and realize this can be an important feature that will greatly benefit us. 
<br><br>
No one should need the specific details about how to solve a quest or where to find particular items, but if they do, they should find an in game method of doing so. I would welcome the day when a player asks the location of a magic suit of armor, and we can tell them to research it in the Erudin library. As Mellia has eloquently demonstrated, one of EverQuest's primary strengths is that it is very immersive. I for one would not want to ruin that.
