<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heyas Nep!  Question for you, why are there no bunnies in EverQuest? 
<br>
Ganlron
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you quite certain there are no bunnies peaking out around the corners of Norrath, testing the air with their cute little noses?   I think there is a good chance that bunnies might be hiding somewhere and, to open your perspective, I will tell you of a very strange experience I had when I went from continent to continent trying to find the elusive little critters.   After I had tracked and searched the lands, seeking to prove or disprove the presence of bunnies, I fell exhausted onto the banks of the river by the stone bridge.  To this day I can't tell you if there really was a superbunny hopping by that stopped to speak with me or if he was simply a figment of an alternate reality playing out in my imagination.  However, before he continued on and then flashed out of sight, I was able to make out the words, "damagicbunny" being repeated over and over in his soft wispy voice.  So, after this experience, my question to you is, "why are you sure there are no bunnies in EverQuest?"   Surely, somewhere in the many manisfestations of the world of Norrath, bunnies are to be found.  Don't give up hope!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Nep, I was wandering through Greater Faydark the other day. I often like to take a stroll through my beautiful home. On this particular day, however, I was treated to a sight that always pains me. I came upon a young lady in the process of butchering one of our fine wolves. While attempting to lull the fine animal, I repeatedly healed both the wolf and the lady. Alas, the fine creature eventually succumbed to the brutal beating. Surprisingly, the lady appreciated my attempts. She claimed to not want to kill the wolves, but they attack her on sight. I have never heard of anything that would increase her standing in the eyes of these majestic creatures. Have you? Any advice would be most graciously appreciated. 
<br>
Lluolin,  Ranger of Kelethin, Champion of Faydark, Servant of Tunare
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, indeed!  I too have suffered unprovoked attacks of the beautiful wolves in the Faydark and even in the Qeynos Hills.  Truthfully, although I have sung my songs many places now, and have often tried to help them by ridding the world of nasties such as the gnolls, the wolves only ceased to bother me when it became apparent to them that I finally had the skill and the power to best them if they attacked.  The lady you met should soon, with perseverance and practice lopping off orc heads, be able to travel among the wolves after she has grown stronger.  However, I must add something here.  Despite your desire to save the "magnificent creatures" from death at the hands of travelers, there are those in the realms of power that would object highly to you aiding the wolf against the lady by healing it or buffing it in any way.  I know from my travels that their remonstrances can be intense.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you put spells in your hotkey bank?  I have heard of this being done many times, but I personally have no idea how its done.
<br>
Sadce
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To put spells in your hotkey bank is a reasonably simple matter.  Make sure all the spells you wish to use have been memmed.  Then make sure your hotkey bank is ready for them.  Left click on the spell icon for the spell you wish to move and hold down the clicker until a second icon in a box appears.  Slide the box to your hotkey bank with your mouse and click it into place.  Sometimes, if you don't have it positioned just right to click into the hotkey bank it will disappear.  Just repeat the process until you have the spell in the correct slot.  Remember, however, you don't click on the spell in your spellbook.  You must click on the spell icons lined up vertically at the left side of your window in order to get the boxes to appear and move them to your hot keys.  Hope this helps.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I send comments to the "Ask" column?  I have clicked on the link at the top of the page MANY times and sent in a question, but nothing ever gets published.  Is this because there is no room, or am I doing something wrong?
<br>
Kiratesl
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiratesl, I'm so sorry that we apparently have not received your previous questions.  (Although, come to think of it, I don't keep a log of player names so I can't really go back to check to see if something did make it through.)  However, be assured that I try to include every question I receive in the very next column.  No mail gets carried over and I haven't yet excluded any mail either.  Thank goodness this question of yours got through ok, so maybe the problem is solved.  Please do resend the questions you had and I'll try to get answers for you.
<br><br>
<em>[Ed. - Absor - for some unknown reason some people receive an error message after they click on the button to send their question off the form.  This error only means that it could not display the "Thank You" page.  Every time that I have checked, the question has been in the file.  So don't worry.]</em>

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would first like to say that I just started reading your site when I saw a link on a web page that led to the article called "Can role-playing be defined?" by Russell Linton. That led me to other stories by following the link and I can only say Wow!  I was very sad to have the "Birth of Evil" story end.  What a fantastic plot. So, my first question is...Is he a "real" writer as in author of novels or such or are you just teasing us with one short story?  And my second questions is about Warriors.  Why is it that any other profession needs to rest for only a short time after a good fight, as for the magi type all is needed about 3 or 4 minutes of meditation and they are ready for battle, or the weaker fighters who can totally heal themselves in a minute and make up the mana in the next fight, But the true warriors, the masters of mayhem and might must sit on our behinds wiggling about for 20 minutes or more if we happen to be without healing support?  Why aren't we able to be up and about in 3-4 minutes like everyone else?  Please help! And take yer time in responding as I have much time between battles.  Thank you! 
<br>
Azariah
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your compliments to Russell Linton.  I'll be sure to ask my editor if he can pass them along as I don't have any way to do so.  As for warriors, well you have asked the very same question I have heard from the bored lips of warriors everywhere I go.  However, I promise you it is NOT a bardic plot to make warriors into captive audiences.  While we bards can be entertaining at times, I can certainly understand that warriors would much prefer the fray to poetry.   That said, I think the real reason warriors do not have a quick regeneration period is that if they could heal up quickly on their own, every healer in the realms would be cooling their heels (ohhh bad pun) in an inn somewhere, bemoaning the lack of adventure.  It is important to remember that Norrath, especially at high levels, is designed with groups in mind and is balanced so that ideally no class is a "killer class" able to survive on its own without major cost to it.  I would suggest that rather than sitting by yourself between battles to heal, you find a friendly bard or druid or shaman or cleric to head down the road with you.  Members of all those classes can offer at least some assistance in getting you back to the fray as soon as possible.
<br><br>
<em>[Ed. - Absor - Me again!  As far as I know, Russell is not a professional writer.  He is, however, a very smart fellow, and puts a lot of effort into what he does.  I'll let him know that you think so highly of him.  Thanks!]</em>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;how long does it take the people at http://guideapp.989studios.com to look at your application.  I applied two weeks ago and they still haven't checked it.  Please help
<br>
Aenaneb
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have an exact answer for you because I think you need to go to the guides themselves by using /petition on your server.  If I were in your shoes, I'd politely ask the guide for help finding out how the checking was coming along and also ask if there is a guide in charge of the applications that you could contact to make sure your application had made it through ok.   I've heard rumors, although I don't know how true they are, that it often takes a month or so before the application is completed.  Also, I'm not sure whether all applicants receive a message as to whether or not they have been accepted as a guide.  You might want to check on that through petition too.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I a Ogre. I was da wunderin' what be da best way to leave da outside of oggok. You an see me get crazy outside of oggok and helpin' kill many bouncers with a Leeper of the Flake! Now ah my own guild likes ta smash my noggin' when i go ta say hi. Me need ta leave Feerot and travel ta da little meats lands sosa i can be nice! But me know fer sure it bein' a long long way! Which way be most fast! Now den me very young but un havin a big sword!  
<br>
Cringer
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Cringer let me congratulate you on your literary accomplishment.  It is rare for me to get letters from Ogres and I do appreciate you writing.  Since, unfortunately, your guild likes to smash my noggin even more than yours, I couldn't make the trip to ask them why they were so harsh on a young ogre.  Instead, I looked over my map of Norrath to see where I think you might try to seek improvement in your guild status.  From what I can see you have many roads open to you but they each bring a full measure of danger and hard travel.  You can of course go from Feerrott into the Rathe Mountains and thus to the western lands.  I don't recommend this unless you have a friend to accompany you, preferably one that can cast sow to speed your journey and a camouflage of some sort to protect you from some very nasty monsters that wouldn't say no to a bite of ogre.  The other option I can see is that of sloshing your way into the Innothule Swamp, perhaps checking to see if the Frogloks might be creatures your guild members would appreciate seeing fewer of in the world.  From the swamp you could of course, head up into the other eastern lands of Norrath, but again, beware of giants and other nasties that might suddenly make the noggin bashing guildmasters seem as gentle as a halfelf.  Whichever way you go, if you can find other ogres as verbally secure as you are, be sure to have a conversation now and then and see what advice you can persuade them to share with you.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been reading your Q&A section and find it extremely useful-- there are answers to questions I didn't even know enough to ask!  My question is about camping.  Not exiting the game camping, but the practice of hanging around (crowded) spawn points, waiting for special npcs to spawn so they can be killed for their items.  I remember reading something about anti-camping code and yielding.  What exactly do these things refer to and how are they enforced?  Thanks!---
<br>
Rilkean, Monk, Tribunal Server
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa, this is a hard one and I will try to put the pieces of the puzzle together for you as much as I can.  Camping so far seems to be a necessary part of play in Norrath that has also created enormous issues as to who gets to kill what when.  The current rules in effect I believe are best discovered by going to the official Everquest Website and looking under Support at the Guide FAQ where it explains the rules the guides use to assist in camping disputes.  A month or two ago, however, the people at Verant started publicly mentioning  the work on developing a "play nice" policy to deal with camping and killstealing issues.    Among the solutions Verant said it was considering were hardcoded anti-camping measures, including moving items around, changing quests and introducing anticamping npcs.  Some of the more recent patches have implemented some of the proposed changes.  Verant also said that they were considering ideas like level limits on who could kill an npc and like the yield rule which would provide that if higher levels wished to camp a spawn, they could only do so if no groups at the level of the spawn wanted to do so.   As far as I can tell, other than the actual hard coding that has taken place, the camping rules in effect are those posted on the official website, not the propositions put forth for discussion.  I do remember a post from Verant that said although the new play nice policy was being considered, that Verant would tell everyone, players and guides and GM's alike when any changes were actually implemented.  As far as I know, there have been no official posts on changing the rules yet.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail Sire! I have recently completed a simple quest (illegible scroll) at Felwithe, and as a reward received a "Potion of Sustenance". Now, I may be a little slow, but I cannot figure out what I am to do with this. I cannot 'use' it by either right or left clicking on it, and when I try to place it in my hand slot, it returns to the general slot. Is this meant to be a food supplement (i.e., will I not get a "you're low on food and drink" message when the potion is present)? Any assistance would be appreciated. 
<br>
Alterer
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to my Pillars of Wisdom, especially Gesler, and to that charming gnome who always seems willing to take a moment away from his latest invention to answer my questions.  Sadly, none could tell me what the Potion of Sustenance really is.  My guess is that the potion may need some additional work on the recipe before it does much of anything.   In this instance, I think you might want to try writing to questhelp@verant.com and asking them if the potion is part of an incomplete quest or whether it is supposed to do something but is bugged or broken.  I do hope you can find some answers.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just wondering what i do with the Skull of Meldrath? i don't want a spoiler or anything just a direction that somebody could point me in. I simply can't figure out what to do with it. the description says it is a magical, lore , and no drop item. so i can't trade it. it has no magical bonuses and so far i can't find any quest that would take a no drop item.  Any help would be muchly appreciated. thanks) 
<br>
Anonymous
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah thank goodness for Casandra and Crav and Gesler, who all were able to shed some light on the uses of the Skull of Meldrath.  The skull is indeed a quest item being part of a quest for rangers, and maybe one for shamans as well.  You might check around to seek if a friendly member of either class would be able to direct you further along the path of the quest.  All I can say is that if I were a ranger, I sure wouldn't destroy the skull without trying to see how to employ it.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;:  Please explain to all those ignorant light races out there that I am proud of the face I chose when I was created. I think my red eyes suit my personality as a visionary, ladies man, and all around evil Teir'dal quite well. And I DO NOT appreciate all of the pink eye jokes I constantly get. I have never contracted pink eye and I don't plan on it and I don't use contacts either. Red is my natural eye color, thank you very much! Do you see me asking ogres and trolls if they are "going to the ballgame"? No (well not very often anyway). I hope that my letter has served to enlighten all of you readers out there.
<br>
Dravic
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is always interesting to receive letters from the Teir'dal and  yours is certainly one of the  politer ones especially considering the duress under which you have suffered.  I am printing your letter so that anyone out there open to considering the enlightenment  you have offered may come to understand your view more clearly.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I don't have a question but want to let you know that i am deeply hurt by what i have been reading in your column about gnomish clerics. Some people in Norrath unfortunately don't understand the meaning of spending good time. This game is not about having the best class and crashing everything. It is about having good time. I am a Gnomish Cleric and proud of being the most intelligent cleric in the whole Norrath. Lower wisdom, so what? Lower mana, so what? If you are smart enough, you can be successful. I have been with many groups so far and never heard anyone complaining about my mana producing ability. In fact i am quite popular in the areas i am hunting. And I enjoy BEING A GNOME, unlike some other people who play the game only to kill and loot.
<br>
Lokman, Gnomish Cleric of 10th Circle
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh dear, there was no intention in my column to cast any aspersions on gnomish clerics, especially the cute little ones I have known.  The discussions were merely centered on the valuation of races by their statistics, not their charm.  Let it be known that I, Nepenthia, adore gnomes and think that you are quite right about gnomes being popular figures for those who wish to most thoroughly enjoy all of what Norrath offers, not just killing and looting.  Thank you for writing so I could have an opportunity to clarify my thoughts on this.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inquis, I have got to disagree with you.  I, being a monk, have been able to strike since level 12..... even with no magical gloves.  For instance, I was in Befallen, with no equipment, and I had to help someone with a nearly dead Iced bone skeleton (I think that's the name).  Anyway, I could not punch him yet could strike him.  I think this was level 15 or 16.  Anyway, my point is, monks DO get magical attacks at level 12.  Also, Nep, 'twas a pleasure to meet you on Veeshan.  But one thing........ Greater Faydark is not a bindable area because it's an extension of Felwithe, it's bindable because Kelethin is in that zone.  There is no separate zone for Kelethin, so they put it in GFay.  So it's bindable.  Also, I think about the only non-city zone that's bindable is Arena.  Not sure if there are any others, though.  Thanks!-
<br>
Aalon, 19 monk (well, just lost 19, dumb Clerics), Veeshan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing on the monk issues and the binding places.  I'm always glad to see your letters.  We do agree on the reason all of Greater Faydark is bindable, however.  Check the previous issue and you'll see.  I had forgotten about Arena.  You're right on that one.  If you find any other non-cities where all can bind, let me know.  
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really a question, just want to clarify the question on monk magical attacks.  Monks' fists become magical after reaching lvl 30, but they receive their first magical attack, round kick, at lvl 5.  Monks then receive a new extra attack every 5 or 10 lvls. (order of attacks are: kick, round kick, tiger claw, eagle strike, dragon punch, and flying kick).   Also, I can think of only one use for the vials of mana produced by the "thicken mana" spell.  They can be used to create the enchanted silk gloves, Wu's fighting gauntlets (monk only). Unfortunately, the gauntlets are the only armor I know of that can be enchanted, hopefully more will be added.  I hope this clarifies everything! 
<br>

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for taking the time to write.  I appreciate your clarifications on the thicken mana spell and your information on monks.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question, but a response.  As far as Monks doing magical attacks go, it works as following: all of a monk's special attacks, aside from the basic kick, are considered magical (i.e., Round Kick, Tiger Claw, Eagle Claw, etc.)  A monk's basic punch is only magical if the monk is wearing some sort of magical glove (netted, woven, mesh, lupine claw gauntlets, etc.)  At 30th level, a monk's basic punch becomes magical, even if he is not wearing any sort of magical glove.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing.  I'm glad you took the time to add to this discussion.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To Clarify your question on Monks and attacks :  1) Normal Attacks (punching) - If a monk wears magic gloves (like Mesh), then their punches can hit magic only monsters at any level. I am given to understand that at L30, monks have the ability to hit magic only monsters with their bare hands.  2) Special Attacks : All the monks special attacks (except possibly kick, I have heard it both ways and have not tested it myself) are able to hit magic only monsters.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for writing in on this.  It's really nice that you took the time to add to the conversation on monks.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question but an answer.  There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding a monk's ability to hit magical creatures.  A monk, through long training and dedication to the perfection of the body as well as the spirit is able to master more forms of unarmed combat than are available to others.  The first of these, revealed at the tenth level of perfection, is the art of the Tiger Claw.  A monk so dedicated as to learn Tiger Claw will have perfected himself to the point where this attack will hit a magical creature.  The Tiger Claw is not a replacement for the simple punch but an addition, much as a simple kick is to a warrior (or to a lower level monk).  The punch, seemingly simpler, is more difficult to master.  It is not until the thirtieth level of perfection that this simple form is able to hit magical creatures as well.  Until then the monk must rely on crutches such as magical gloves to fully realize his potential against magical opponents.

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dearest Nepenthia, I write to you today to help to clarify some question that were asked of you in EQX 100.  As far as the looting of corpse to allow for the fallen beasts of Norrath to respawn -- An unlooted corpse will not effect the spawning of subsequent monster, it will only cause additional strain on the players systems as it is more information for their computer and processors to deal with.  As for the ability of monks to strike wisps -- Until level 30 the most viable options for monk are netted, woven, or mesh gloves.  These will allow us to strike enchanted creatures such as will o wisps.  Beginning with the round kick at level 5 (and ending with the flying kick at level 30) all monk 'special' attacks are considered magical.  Finally, at level 30, a monks fists are magical by nature, and we no longer require special gloves to strike enchanted creatures.  Hope I was helpful, and thank you for a wonderful column.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel like I'm at a feast hosted by monks, each passing along additional morsels of information for all to enjoy.  Thank you for taking the time to write.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning Monks: I have been a Monk for quite some time now and I can tell you so much: Monks can hit magical creatures with their bare fists as soon as they get magical gloves! Their special attacks are always magical with the exception of the mundane Kick that gets replaced on level 5 by Round Kick.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your comments and help on clarifying the situation about monks' magical attacks.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Greetings Nepenthia, first of all I'd like to thank you for a nice column. I really don't have any questions although I have some answers tome issues in #100.1. To once and for all clarify the monk problem about magical punches, a monk's punches become magical when he/she reaches lvl 30. Before that the punches may be magical if the monk wear magical gloves. Monks do however have special attacks which are magical in nature. Lvl 5 = Round kick, Lvl 10 = Tiger Claw, Lvl 20 = Eagle Strike, Lvl 25 = Dragon Punch, Lvl 30 = Flying Kick. Hope this will help  :)Now over to the poor Shadow Knight who felt neglected even tho I have a hard time picturing a huge troll sitting on the ground crying over the injustice  :)  When looking thru different sites I only found 2 which were SHD only weapons. Both were 2H slashing, Dark Reaver & Reaper of the Dead. There are +250 weapons a shadow knight is able to use and a lot of the named weapons are WAR/SHD only..therefore my conclusion is there are quite a lot of weapons shadow knights are able to wield and still not having to see a lot of players with the same kind of weapon...maybe an occasional warrior or 2  :)

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well me heard da other sk whining and crying about da weepans dat we gots and he right, we gots only 2 dat i knows of da dark reaver, and da reaper of da dead.  Sure we gots da fleshripper, da razing sword of skarlon and da soulleach but how many peeps you know got a soulleacher, probly not too many of dem.  Not only dat but dey is warrior and sk. What really make me mad is dat da sissy boy paladins gots about 4 or 5 ones dat are very gud and only dem can use and dey come from da fun questin and such and we just gotta go get are behinds whupped to get ours in some deep dark dungeons filled with doggies or froggies.  Me tink verant shud put in high quality 1 handed slasher or basher for dat sk's might have somethin to compete with da ghoulbaner, and dey shud also put in a very high quality 2 hand slasher dat cud compete with da soulburnder and da firey avenger

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing.  As a half elf, I'm not sure I echo your sentiments on the paladins, but of course, we bards try to help all stories get told and all opinions get heard.  I'm so sorry to hear about your uncomfortable skin condition under your drawers.   Do you think you could find a shaman willing to stop barshing long enough to make you some ointment so you can scratch less?
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, one last correction.  The question about multiple /auc's is a tricky one as the macro will allow multiple /gsays, /tells, /guildsay's etc, but /auc is limited to one for some reason.  The person who replied with the following is correct:

I think I have figured out how players are using multiple lines in auctions without having the text command at the beginning of every sentence. Just fill the custom box with text and switch your chat to auction. Thanks for the info,
