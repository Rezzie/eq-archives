A prophet came from far off land <br>
and Darkmoon took her by the hand. <br>
Its Patriarch, both strict yet kind, <br>
had welcomed her with food and wine, <br>
for he had "seen" she was the one. <br>
The prophecy had just begun. 
<br><br>
Her gift was from the Prince of Hate <br>
and Darkmoon was to be her fate. <br>
She knows she's young and not so strong <br>
but Darkmoon helps her, right or wrong. <br>
They know the prophecy fulfilled <br>
requires her to be in their guild. 
<br><br>
As days go by she learns to fight <br>
and studies hard both day and night. <br>
She shares her sight. She cooks and scribes <br>
while siblings guard her with their lives. <br>
Oh Innoruuk, she does her best <br>
to serve her "family" is her quest. 
<br><br>
Hail Darkmoon!
