	Blistering cold seeps into my bones. The darkness that shrouds my thoughts ebbs and flows as the tides of the ocean. Through this darkness, I hear screams. I hear voices.
<br><br>
	"You must help her Elder Shaman. I have had dreams of this one."
<br><br>
	"What was she doing in Blackburrow? People like her come from far past the mountains and seldom venture into the peaks of Everfrost."
<br><br>
	"Regardless, do your best to aid her. She is much needed."
<br><br>
	"Darnack, I never doubt your words, and know your honor as a Wolf of the North. I will do my best."
<br><br>

	The voices faded. The light sound of ritual drumming filled my head. Chanting echoed throughout my ears and the horrible chill faded. I slept soundly.
<br><br>

	When I awoke from my slumber, I was disoriented to say the least. I sat up to find myself in a wood paneled room. The décor was rustic and homey. There was a large fireplace on the wall before me, the hearth of which was broad and slightly dusty. There was a cauldron hanging over the fire, and the wonderful aroma of stewed meat wafted from within. My head was aching terribly and there was a dull pain coming from my right leg. I looked down and realized that I was clad only in a simple shirt. It was made of a wonderfully soft material, and extended well past my knees, similar to a nightgown. I tried to remember exactly what had happened, but when I did my headache became worse and my head seemed to fill with intensifying wails. 
<br><br>
	I pulled the bear skin blanket that had kept me covered away from my legs to see that there was now a mottled scar around my calf.  The scar was roughly the length of the palm of my hand and about as wide as three fingers.
<br><br>
	"What happened to me?" I said to myself as I examined the rest of my leg for any other developments.
<br><br>
	"You took quite a nasty spill in Blackburrow" said a voice from my right. 
	<br><br>
	
	I looked over to see an extremely tall, rough cut man wearing a shirt similar to the one I found myself in, only against his broad shoulders the shirt seemed a bit small.
<br><br>
	"Greetings, Dark One. I am Darnack Plainswalker, warrior of the Wolves of the North."
<br><br>
	I covered myself rapidly with the bearskin and said, "I would normally be a bit more cordial, but it seems that I am quite unaware of how I came to be here."
<br><br>
	Darnack merely smirked at my modesty and said. "I found you in the gorge in Blackburrow, den of the foul Sabretooh Gnolls.  Someone had started a stampede of the nasty bastards, and I was preparing myself for the flood when you … dropped in. You seemed badly hurt, so when I dispatched with the foul beasts I hefted you over my shoulder and slashed my way back to Everfrost. I then convinced my clan shaman to tend to your wounds. You were as good as dead when you landed, but the spark of life stays in you."
<br><br>
	"Everfrost?" I said hesitantly. "Everfrost is where I was heading. I was to come here to collect the necklaces of the Ice Goblins." 
<br><br>
	"The unmelting ice?" the barbarian inquired, "Those cowardly gobs fall before me daily. I collect those beads for fun."
<br><br>
	With that he walked across the room and opened a small locker that was in the corner by the hearth. When he lifted the lid of that box, light sparkled from the inside and danced in the chaotic rhythm of the hearth fire. I attempted to get out of bed, quite astounded that I could walk on my scarred leg with little to no effort.  I looked into the box and saw scores of the reflective beads glittering happily in their resting-place. 
<br><br>
	I looked at the bear of a man who had helped me so narrowly escape death. He seemed quite proud of his collection of trinkets. 
<br><br>
	"Of course," he said with a widening grin. "These things are as common as ice in Permafrost, but they are nice to look at and show quite well how many gobs I can kill when given the chance."
<br><br>
	"The fact that I am alive and out of that horrid place is proof enough of that for me," I said as the memories of what he called "Blackburrow" rushed full force into my mind. "You were most valiant in saving my life. Is there any way that I might repay you."
<br><br>
	He looked upon me with a solemn expression. 
	<br><br>
	"I do have one request, and it may seem somewhat strange to you." He said as he rose to his feet.
<br><br>
	"Anything I can provide."
<br><br>
	"I have long been a protector of Halas. As a Wolf of the North, it is one of my responsibilities, but as of late my mind has been wandering. I seek the sights of the world past the den of Blackburrow. I ask only that you allow me to travel with you. I shall earn my keep by serving as a bodyguard, and would assist you in any way necessary."
<br><br>
	"I must admit that my heart has felt the same wanderlust. Company of course would be welcomed on the road, and I see from my … mishap in Blackburrow that you would be a most worthy companion. I would be honored to travel with you, but I would like to know why you are so willing for your companion to be me."
<br><br>
	"I have my motivations." He said in a tone that indicated that he was not about to divulge them. "In due time they will be made known"
<br><br>
	"You have saved my life, I will grant you the privacy of your thoughts."
<br><br>

	There was an uncomfortable silence as the warrior sat in thought. I had not seen a barbarian up until now, and was under the impression that they were much… hairier than the contemplative man before me was. He was relatively clean given the living conditions, but his clothes seemed rather old and dingy. His lodgings were spartan to say the least. It appeared that his home consisted of only a bed, a fireplace, and the chests that he kept his belongings in.  His face was marked with an intricate blue design, and I was about to ask the meaning of these marking when he tuned to me and said, 
<br><br>
"How is your leg feeling? It was broken quite badly by the fall. I was afraid you would lose it before I got you back here to Halas."
<br><br>
	"There is some pain, albeit mild." I said as I looked down at my legs. I quickly realized that I had let my modestly slip and felt blood rush to my face in embarrassment.  
<br><br>
	"That is an impressive scar." Said Darnack as he strode to the opposite corner of the room. "A warrior would only hope to learn from a scar like that."
<br><br>
	He opened another chest that sat on a small table and pulled out some more familiar garments. He brought them over to where I was standing and said, "Bloodstained clothes aren't the most comfortable. Blood gets itchy when it dries. I did the best I could to get the stains out in the Nest, but there was only so much I could do."
<br><br>
	I looked at the robes that had been given to me by the Crimson Hand. I never realized just how dark blood was until I saw it in contrast to my already crimson robe.  There was a large patch of deep red near the bottom of the garment, where my leg was, of course. Other than that there were only a few tears and rips where the rocks had ground into my back. I accepted the clothing and looked around for a place to change. Darnack looked at me rather strangely and asked, "What are you looking for?"
<br><br>
	"A place to change clothes." I said, slightly annoyed that he expected me to change right here.
<br><br>
	"I don't exactly have much room here," he said with a smirk. "But if you really want me to leave I will."
<br><br>

	Now I see the barbarian. 
<br><br>
	"No, I will do it here." I said as I slipped the robe over my head. I left my arms inside the body of the robe and slipped them out of the shirt. I then lifted the shirt past my arms and slipped fully into the robe. 
<br><br>
	Darnack was nearly in tears from trying to refrain from laughing at my attempts at modesty.
<br><br>
	I pulled the shirt from the neck of the robe and tossed it in the barbarian's direction.
<br><br>
	"Bravo!" he said, clapping his hands appreciatively. "Any other tricks up your sleeves?"
<br><br>
	I eyed Darnack and said, "There are more, but I would rather get the rest of my equipment."
<br><br>
	He reached back into the chest again and produced the rest of my belongings. I took the backpack that my guild gave me and filled it from the chest in the corner. 
	<br><br>
	"I guess that saves us the trouble of having to hunt down the goblins," I said with a slight smile. 
<br><br>
	I looked again at the stew that was bubbling on the fire. It smelled wonderful.
<br><br>
	"Are you hungry?" He said, seeing that I was looking at the cauldron. "I made that for when you awoke. It's stewed polar bear, a local specialty."
<br><br>
	"I am starving." I said gratefully. 
<br><br>
	He went over to the cauldron and pulled a couple of earthen bowls from the mantle. He pulled a large ladle from the pot and dipped up a couple of bowls full. He handed me mine and proceeded to drink the thick stock straight from the bowl. I looked around and realized that there was not a single utensil anywhere to be seen. I was not about to give him the opportunity to laugh at my civility again, and followed suit. The smell from the bowl was heavenly. The stock was well thickened and seasoned wonderfully. As I drank the stew warmth spread throughout my body, and I felt revitalized. 
<br><br>
	"This is wonderful," I said over my bowl. "Where did you learn to cook like this?" 
<br><br>
	"When you are out in the tundra for a while you realize quickly that you have to eat what you find. I decided that I might as well at least enjoy it. I learned from one of the innkeepers in town what herbs grow in the peaks of Everfrost and harvested them for him. In return, he taught me some of the best recipes."
<br><br>
	"If you fight as well as you cook, I believe I will be well cared for."
<br><br>
	I looked around the room and realized there were no windows. In my haze of memories and disorientation, I had no idea what day it was.
<br><br>
	"Night is falling if that is what you are wondering." Darnack remarked. "Your loss of time is familiar to me. I have been near death many times. It is something you don't get used to."
<br><br>
	"We will need to leave in the morning," I said. "I need to get back home, my family will be worried sick."
<br><br>
	"Get some rest, we will have to go back through Blackburrow again tomorrow. You will need your wits about you. And please, this time avoid the gorge."
<br><br>
	I cast a defensive look at Darnack, then averted my eyes. "It was a mistake. It will not happen again."
<br><br>
	"Don't get so upset. You lived, and learned. Just be aware of your mistakes and do not make them again. That is the only way to stay alive out there."
<br><br>
	 I finished the last of the wonderfully tender meat in the bottom of my bowl and decided that I still had a little sleep left in me. Darnack had prepared himself a bedroll on the floor, and was already situating himself for the night.
<br><br>
	"We will gather some supplies in the morning," He said with a yawn. "Then we will cross the peaks and cut through Blackburrow. Until then, sleep well."
<br><br>
	I got back into the bed still wearing my robes. No need to change, I wouldn't want to go through the torment of changing in front of him again. He had a kind soul and seemed earnest about his belief that he needed to travel with me. His brawn would definitely be necessary in the end, but he also impressed me with the depth of his intelligence. I was under the impression that barbarians were ill mannered unwashed brutes who valued nothing more than death and destruction. Here was an apparently deep and giving soul who pulled me out of the depths of a beast infested cavern for a truly noble reason… because I needed help.
<br><br>
	I lay my head down and covered myself with the bear hide. The cold north winds howled outside as though they had a life of their own. I closed my eyes and began to drift to sleep. 
<br><br>
	My dreams were painfully familiar, and troubled. Death loomed over my thoughts like blight. Darkness gave way to flame. Fear washed over me.
