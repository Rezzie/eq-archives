<em>[Ed. - I figure I'll post the entire string of e-mails that made up this conversation.]</em>
<br><br>
Absor,
<br><br>
Just read your latest editorial and I was going to bore you at length with a
rebuttal of why I feel that you are SO wrong (regarding the pothole vs. pot
analogies). But I realized that there was a greater chance of me winning the
lottery than you reading a critical email with an open mind.  So I'm just
going to exercise my method of "voting" on the validity of your e-zine.
<br><br>
I'm "canceling" my subscription - i.e., removing the "favorites" link, not
visiting the web site anymore, eliminating my hits from you counter.

It's hard for me to argue my point if you don't think I can be open about a discussion.  I'm sorry that you feel that way.  I'd hate to think that you'd give up Archy just because you don't like his editor...
<br><br>

I re-read my email and realized that it sounds like a personal attack, it is
not (or, at least, was not meant to be).  Here's what I was thinking at the
time of writing; 
<br><br>
		But I realized that there was a greater chance of me winning
the lottery than you reading a critical EMAIL (FROM SOMEONE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW)
with an open mind.
<br><br>
The difference being that I could not expect you to act with an open mind,
when I myself would not most likely not have an open mind were I in the same
position.  That said, I have disagreed with so many of your editorials that
I felt as if I was supporting view points that I disagreed with if I
continued visiting the site.
<br><br>
Pathing bug - While pot vs pot-hole is a somewhat clever play on words, I
feel that the similarity between the arguments ends with the word pot.  The
major flaw I found in your pot argument is this, the US government doesn't
make the pot, Verant HAS made the pot-hole.  In my opinion the rule should
state more clearly, "due to limitations in the design and hardware, we are
forced to live with an NPCs inability to correctly navigate around certain
environmental obstacles.  Unfortunately we must enforce a strict policy to
prevent players from taking advantage of these environmental quirks."  
<br><br>
I don't cheat.  I obey the rules as written because I have respect for the
product and I want my character to succeed with honor.  That doesn't mean
that I blindly follow them without questioning their validity.  It also
doesn't mean that I don't have sympathy for those people who stray into an
area that breaks these rules, especially when the rules are created to cover
up a design deficiency (and an unapologetic deficiency at that).
<br><br>
Roleplaying switch - I felt that it was a first step in the right direction.
Add filters too /ooc and /shout and the /roleplayer is playing a game that
is free from Blackhawksfan shouts "how bout that game last night", but can
still here Blackhawksfan say "please move, d00d".
<br><br>
Experience loss for dying - this is a game with many, many unforeseen
circumstances that can cause near instant death.  At the same time,
exploration is encouraged (rightly so, I feel that exploration is the most
entertaining part of this game).  If I can lose 2 hours of carefully thought
out play to an unexpected link death, then I'm no longer having fun.  Your
answer - "you should have been aware of the situation" is a slap in the face
of the "get out and see the world" encouragement that Verant espouses.
<br><br>
Roleplaying in general - I just feel that your tone is constantly of a "this
is how you should play the game" instead of "this is how I like to play the
game".  I don't feel it's a subtle difference (perhaps we disagree on this
point as well).  Verant said - we feel that roleplaying cannot be defined.
Verant should have said - we cannot force people to roleplay, we can only
encourage it.  We make it a high priority to, within the limitations of time
and the game design, encourage roleplaying as much as possible.  Hollywood
manages to churn out extremely poor movies year after year, yet you seem to
expect a large part of the populace to get the roleplaying part of MMORPG in
exactly the same way that you get.  That seems to me hugely arrogant.
<br><br>
SEE! You've probably jumped to this part in the letter because you got bored
when you realized what a huge blow-hard I am.  The first letter was much
probably much easier on the both of us.

Every issue seems to be chock full of tales, but I've never been interested in them.  I've always read for the articles, yet you seem to be slowly phasing them out!
 <br><br>
I still enjoy your editorial though ;)

Hail from the icy peaks of Everfrost!
 <br><br>
I recently started a character about a week ago on the mysterious plane of Tallon Zek, the first Racewar server.  My character, Galedor Icewind, has already survived nine seasons in the harsh frozen wastes of Everfrost and battle against the fierce dogs of Blackburrow.  Eventually, he intends to travel to the far east where the fellow denzines of Freeport constantly battle with the dark scourge of the Tier'Dial and bring glory and honor to his people.  (Perhaps when the Tribunal finally grants him the name 'Icewind' on the beginning of this 20th season.)
 <br><br>
Have you ever played on the PvP-teams servers?  It doesn't seem like there really is much about that portion of our game on EQX.
 <br><br>
Alot of people have declared that the Racewar is a lost cause; a sort of "organized Rallos Zek."  However, I've seen some of the best roleplaying in all of EQ on this server.  Perhaps you should check it out.

<em>[Ed. - Most of us had already hunkered down onto certain servers before the racewar servers came up.  We've popped in there, but I don't think any
of us play there extensively, so it wouldn't be too fair to write about them.  However, as I noted above,
we gladly accept and read submissions from readers.]</em>

EQX,
<br><br>
I've just read Absor's editorial on exploitation which was written as a
response to a letter. I think Absor has missed the original author's
point. His point is not "I think exploitation is ok", rather its "If
Verant wants to stop exploitation then FIX THE BUGS!"  The punishment is
a side issue. The point is if the problems were patched then there would
be no exploiters to punish.
<br><br>
The pathing problem in particular is a sore point with me and has been
the subject of much discussion recently between myself and a friend. I
know of two locations where casters can stand back and safely unleash
damage spells with no fear of being attacked.  They can even stop and
meditate!  Both of these bugs have been reported to Verant.  In the case
of the Cazic-Thule bug a Guide even came down to lay down the law. 
That's fine.  But these bugs are not new. Yet they remain unpatched. 
Why? This is particularly frustrating as there would seem to be a simple
solution. Implement some variant of the following.
<br><br>
If a target is trying to move toward you but is unable to make any
progress in your direction (presumably stuck by the local geometry)
then, after some small delay, it simply teleports to your location. This
stops people from medding while their red-level targets try in vain to
attack. It also fixes all known and unknown pathing bugs everywhere in
the game at once.
<br><br>
My friend Highline has recently sent a similar suggestion to Verant and
I expect that it will be read and at least considered by someone.  Is it
a good idea?  I don't know.  But I do think that Verant should work to
get these and other exploits fixed as quickly as possible.  Banning
exploiters addresses the symptom.  Fix the problem and the symptom goes
away.
<br><br>

With best regards,

<em>[Ed. - I agree that it may have sounded like I missed the point, but I really didn't.
I agree, the pathing bugs need to be fixed and doing so would stop the exploiting.  We talked 
about it a bit by e-mail.  Here's an excerpt from one of Tolil's messages:
<br><br>
</em>Your right to petition and my right not to is not what I was trying to
address. What I was trying to point out is that the finger is being pointed
in the wrong direction. Instead of petitioning with "There are 20 people
abusing the cents/hermit, fix the bug!" people petition with "Ban this
player!"<em>
<br><br>
I understand and agree.  I don't encourage finger pointing, and I hope I didn't sound that way
last week.  There's blame enough on both sides, the exploiters and Verant.  It's probably
best if we lay off pointing fingers at either.]</em>

  Just wanted to say good job for all the work all of you do.  I love a lot of the artwork you have, and I read the Fit to Print sections every time =) .  Anyway, just a quick comment, keep up the great work (PS:  Where has Lrets D'pearl gone??)
