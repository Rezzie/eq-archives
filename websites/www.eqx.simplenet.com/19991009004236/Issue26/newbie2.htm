My grades started to suffer so I took a break.  <em>I was at least living in
reality enough to realize I needed a break.</em>  So I cut my playing time to a
few times a week.    Sometime during my absence, the Gods on the MUD started
changing things around.  They became very bossy, and annoying, constantly
playing tricks on players, or taking control of MOBS and making them do
unpredictable things to get players killed.

The MUDS creators had been working on a second world on another server for
several years and were nearing a beta.  They threatened often to replace the
original MUD and force everyone to play the new one.  Threats of purges
became an everyday thing.  A lot of people started quitting.  Most of my
friends had left, and the game had become very boring.  I left the game
altogether.  It was a year later I decided to go back to that same MUD.
To my disbelieve they still had not finished the second world, and were still
using the original code.  Everyone that I knew was gone, and replaced with
all new names.   I think I played for about two weeks becoming very bored,
and left again.  I have never played there since.

I still find time to play on a few other MUDS.  I have written several levels
for them in my spare time.  I love building.  It has become a nice way to
relax when I'm stressed out.

My son now plays, and its interesting to watch him go through a lot of the
same things I went through.  Including the drop in grades, which I had to
ground him for, thus taking away his computer (grin).  I'm happy to report
however, that his grades have since improved.  
<br><br>
I'm looking forward to getting that newbie feeling back with the release of
EverQuest.  Where I can once again be a "Newbie".
