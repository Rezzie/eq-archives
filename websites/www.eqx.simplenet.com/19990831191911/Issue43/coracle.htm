The air was still damp from the mist that blew relentlessly inland from the coast.   Pas glanced up at the lightening sky and dreaded the day to come.  Another night spent researching relentlessly only to be rewarded with tired eyes and cramped muscles. Her master, Cork, would want to drill endlessly on the dry topic of rune etymologies as he had every third day for the last two years.  It seemed to be a never-ending topic and unfortunately one of his favorites. 
<br><br>
With a resigned sigh Pas hefted her Journeyman's staff and moved purposefully down the deserted street.  Four turns and two alleys later She found herself on the narrow lane that lead to the Silver Spindle, a quiet inn that was popular with apprentices and journeymen in the south quarter of Quinos. 
<br><br>
Under the signboard she stopped to browse the public postings.  There were several ads seeking specialized enchantments and one ad seeking a battle wizard for a traveling caravan. She toyed with the ideal of responding to the add seeking a crystal light rod, as the construction materials were inexpensive and the cost in manna would not affect her upcoming journeyman's trial. 
<br><br>
Pas was nearing the end of her journeyman training and knew that the time to finish her journeyman's work was at hand.  It was traditional, and required, that she develop a specialized enchantment to finish her rank and start her career as a Quinos trained Enchantress. It was this spell that Pas had been researching and she was satisfied that she had the correct formula for her creation.
<br><br>
Glancing up she notice the senior apprentice of Orimdal, Nequetec, hurrying towards her.
<br><br>
"Pas!" he cried as he spotted her in front of the message board. "Have you heard? The Circle has moved the schedule for the journeyman trial ahead two days. Orimdal is furious as Tulkique has not finished his preparations for the test."
<br><br>
"Oh damn" Pas replied "I really have to get a leg up. I have finished mine but I have not finished the inscription. Thanks for the update Nequetec. I had planned to take a nap before I had to listen to Cork drone but I guess I will be mapping the spell instead." 
<br><br>
With a wave she turned and ran the rest of the way to Cork's house on Cobblers Street.  She planned to debut the spell for Cork before the trial but it seemed as though it would not be possible with the advancement of the test schedule. 
<br><br>
Cork was still snoring loudly as she crept up the stairs to he alcove.  Digging into her pouch she withdrew the velum scroll on which the majority of her journeyman's spell was inscribed. Silver lines lay dully on the page waiting for the shaping rune to close the inscription. It was this rune that she had been searching for at the Library. Weeks of searching had lead her to one obscure possibility. The rune of closure was unusual and she had found it by accident while she was searching for spell to enchant water.  She had been itching to try it but, as with all runes of this type, it would only reveal its specialized effect when used as the end construct of a spell. 
<br><br>
Carefully Pas opened her bottle of silver ink and began her focusing mantra. Setting her stylus at the closure points of the spell she carefully linked the last lines of power with the rune of Yid. Manna flowed from the pen tip and she could feel the leaching quality of the spell as it drained her magical energies through the nib and into the ink on the page. Luminescent mist began to boil up from the scroll and she waited expectantly as it began to gather velum.  Here, in this moment she would have an inkling of the final form of her enchantment. Her focus moved deeper into the mist above the page and then she saw it.  A shell, scalloped and as white as the Sands of Erdu floated lightly in the mist. It was framed in tentacles which ungulated aimlessly as though it was trying to gather the ethereal mists to itself. She sighed as the lines of power faded and the vision evaporated.
<br><br>
"It is beautiful" rumbled Cork.
<br><br>
She turned and realized that the draw of manna must have disturbed his sleep and he had come silently to watch the work in progress.
<br><br>
"I have never seen the Coracle of Praxus so elegantly done, and never with any visible means of locomotion. Pas you have done well with this journeyman's endeavor." He glanced over her shoulder and smiled, "It is also an excellent choice of enchantment for someone that despises walking as much as you." Scratching unashamedly he shambled back down the stairs. Pas smiled, it was rare that Cork offered praise and it served well to settle the writhing of her stomach.  Stretching her tired shoulders she pulled the curtain on her dormer window and settled into her bed to catch a catnap. Cork would be fully awake soon and begin whining for his morning tea. 
<br><br>
"Now" she thought, " if only there is a much mist as there is this morning I will be set". Cork had been kind enough not to mention how foolish she had been to tie her enchantment to a condition of the weather.
