My thanks to Absor for keeping the newspaper going so well while I was away.  Absor has agreed to take on the title of general editor for an indefinite period, and we have every confidence in his abilities seeing as how great a job he has done while I was away.  I will take on the title of head editor, which will leave me free to organise new features for EQX and to potentially dissapear for short periods of time for job interviews etc.<br><br>The section format will be changing, the Rose and Blade section will not necessarily appear every issue, and new sections may start springing up.  We will start taking an increasing interest in the EverQuest guilds and EQ dedicated web sites, and there may be a new EQX section starting up soon that reflects this.<br><br>Due to Absor’s far more lenient stance of accepting articles from non-staff members, I have decided to reduce the staff to just those members that are at least fairly active.<br><br>EQX seems to have secured a regular weekly readership of around 175 people, and we expect to see a steady growth of readership numbers as we approach beta.  Thanks to all our regular readers for supporting our publication, and keep watching for all the exciting new developments to come.<br><br>Kit  ^..^</p><br><hr><br><p align="justify">Hello all.  And welcome back Kit!<br><br>And with Kit comes some much needed enthusiasm.  You may have noticed that I have fiddled a bit with some of the graphics and such.  Well, we are thinking of making some sweeping changes to the format of EQX and I was just experimenting with some stuff.  Don't let it bother you.  :)  <br><br>I am itching for the beta to start.  Even if I can't play (cross my fingers, knock on wood, where's thatfour leaf clover!), I hope to drag some stories out of those that do.  Keep that in mind.  I will soon be hounding you all like, well, like Kit to tell me the tales of Norrath.  Then all I will need is to find the chink in the armor of the great beast NDA!<br><br>Absor</p><br><hr><br><font size="+1">Please enjoy this issue of EQX!</font></p></font><br><p>The current list of all EQX staff is as follows (displayed in first name alphabeticalorder):<br><br><strong>Absor, Arawn, Ian Ash, Jaga the Wise, Kit&nbsp;&nbsp;^..^, Magi, Malaclypse, Rogue Mord, Starspyre.</strong></p></body></html>
