The famed Alarik proudly strode up to the arena. Clad in golden
platemail, his green cape waved with every step he took.  He was the
first warrior to arive at the tournament it would seem. The only other
person there was a mage by the look of him. Brown robed, wearing only a
somber expression on his face.
<br><br>
"Hail. I am here to test my mettle with the best of them" Alarik stated,
with a quick glance at the sharped halberd he was carrying.
<br><br>
"Warriors sit to the south" the mage told him.
<br><br>
 Alarik walked around the arena to the seats to the south and waiting
for the rest to arrive. One by one, warriors arrived, along with others
coming to watch the small tournament. About 25 people in all, 12 of them
there to fight. People quickly sat around the arena as Alarik waited for
his name to be called.
<br><br>
"Once they fight, we kill both fighters." Alarik overheard from an odd
group of 3 standing outside the arena.
<br><br>
"wont we lose noto?" One of them asked.
<br><br>
"No, they will both be flagged criminal for fighting".
<br><br>
"Oh..I C" said the second man.
<br><br>
 From another one of the seats, there was a man who must have had a
mental problem.
<br><br>
"MORTAL KOMBAT!" He would repeatedly say over and over. the noise was so
loud Alarik could not hear what anyone else was saying, and barely see
anything going on either.
<br><br>
 The tournament was able to be organized after 45 minutes of trying to
get people under control. The first two fighters stepped into the ring
and went to battle.  It was a back and forth battle, with neither of
them having the upper hand. They had crippled each other to near death.
The next hit by either of them would end the fight. Alarik watched,
enthralled by the great match. Then, all of  a sudden, there was the
sound of two arrows, and both men dropped to the floor. The 3 men that
had been talking before the tournament laughed and took off running.

 If you have tried to attend or put on a roleplayed even in Ultima
Online, you probably have had a similar experience to that. This is what
happened when I attempted to fight in a tournament, just the other day
in UO (Yes, I'm playing UO, but just because I'm not in the 1st phase of
EQ beta) . That story isn't even a quarter of what went on to disrupt
the event. We had spammers filling up the screen with "@@@@" just trying
to lag people, others trying to loot the warriors as they lost matches,
and other people talking about the Simpson's, Baseball, South Park, or
anything else completely unrelated.
<br><br>
 As hard as it is to understand, people will intentionally try to
disrupt a roleplayed event simply for the sake of doing it. There was an
old argument, probably still occuring on message boards, about if random
player killers are trying to ruin the game. Of course the PKs say they
are simply playing their style and not trying to hurt anyone else's fun,
and the other side screams bloody murder at them (literaly). Well, I
can't get into that discussion but, it is a fact that there are a lot of
people that do intentionally try to disrupt things and ruin other
people's fun.  We, in the Everquest community seem to be pushing for a
better environment for roleplying than past experiences, but we can't
expect that we won't get our share of assholes. The fact that many of us
have stopped going to the irc channel, #everquest, or checking the
EQVault message board (No offense to WarDragon) show this. Even the
monthly chats.."Breast size" and "Beer Helmets"? Although, they have
stated they will be trying to get some deterents to that behavior in the
game, can it really even be done?
<br><br>
There are a ton of ways to be obnoxious, and the irritators will find a
way.  SISA has promised to be quicker to ban people than UO for bug
abuse, but I don't see any evidence to show they will do the same for
people that aren't allowing others to roleplay effectively. And there
are lots of ways for people to cause enough disruption to keep other
people from getting into character.
<br><br>
 The mentality of these people is hard to understand. A lot of them are
young kids, and there is no way to keep them out of the game. They are
playing on Daddy's powerful computer and paying with his credit card,
and SONY will take their money as readily as they will take ours. There
is no point in trying to talk sense into them, as I remember being that
age myself, and the good it would have done. And that isn't meant as a
knock at kids. I know there are quite a few good roleplaying ones out
there. Yet, I can't imagine many grown men or women running around in
the game, calling each other "Nigga", and "Byatch", or spamming the
screen just for the sake of ruining a roleplayed event.
<br><br>
 And I have seen the other end of the spectrum. I once played on a MUD
based on Tolkien's Middle Earth, that did enforce roleplaying. When you
created a character, you chose to be an Elf, Hobbit, Goblin, Good Human,
or Evil Human. You started in the headquarters for your race, and you
were instructed to first go to your superiour and do a task for him. I
started out patroling an area for goblins. It was fun, yet quite a bit
restrictive as your role was really set for you from the start. If you
were a disruptive person, you were simply banned from the game. Of
course, that MUD was free, so they didn't lose your business by banning
you, but oh how I wish for that type of response to a disruptive person.
<br><br>
 One thing I don't understand at all, is the reluctance to have any kind
of seperate servers. The idea has been tossed around a lot, but game
designers always say " No way". Setting a side a few servers for people
that plan to seriously roleplay, or at least sign an agreement not to
disrupt roleplaying in any way makes sense to me. If they break the
agreement, then SONY would not have to lose their money, they could
simply ban them from those servers. Many of us truely wish to experience
what an Online RPG could provide in the way of roleplaying. Please allow
us to do so.
