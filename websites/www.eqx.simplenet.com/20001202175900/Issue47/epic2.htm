<i>A FAR FATED VOYAGE, AN OLD THREAT, AND A BLADE IN HAND...</i>
<br><br>

Moon and star seemed to hang over the dreamy expanse of night that rimmed the sleeping lands of Antonica. The moon followed star in path, cascading silvery drizzle through thick cracks in the night clouds hanging low over a platinum sea.  Quiet, not a sound above the sea swells could be heard. Loneliness, as though nature itself slumbered under the cotton silver canopy of moonbeam sky. Stealing through the ice liquid plain, lending her gentle swish to the ocean waves, sped the <i>Fawn</i> like an exiled whale. Her sail adorned with the standard of Lord Marion, a moon circumscribed in a diamond representing the main virtues; her hull stout and heavy, as if bulging from the cargoes she was built to carry, and a lone figure standing resolutely at her bow, feminine undoubtedly, her white gossamer blowing in the gentle sea breeze as if the ivory moon had lent a modicum of her lunar flesh. Quite an unlikely sight in that part of the sea.
<br><br>
The deck of the <i>Fawn</i> was barren except for a young freckled boy at the helm and a sailor keeping watch in the crows nest, and the lady keeping vigil at the bow. The night was more a silver twilight, the twin moons and the hive of stars above casting everything in a strange eldritch glow. The lady's silk robes glowed like <i>arcana</i>, and the eyes of the night watches wandered involuntarily toward her diligent figure, poorly hidden under the flowing cloak. The eyes snapped back to their duties in a blink as the heavy footstep of the captain shattered the spell of silence. Lord Beleron appeared from his cabin, hands cupped behind him in the typical dignity of a noble, surveyed the scene on the deck, pondering briefly at his unique passenger standing alone above the figurehead. He straightened his tunic and approached her curiously. She did not stir or speak, or give any indication that she was aware of his presence.  Beleron stood behind her, briefly joining her in the view of the Great Sea, before he felt the need to speak.
<br><br>
"We are ten leagues out of port Lady Marietta, taking the safest route we should arrive in Kaladim a day and a noon from now." His report was meant to assure her, but Beleron realized as he barked it that it was a fruitless gesture. Gently putting his huge, sea callused hand on her shoulder, he softened his voice in assurance, "Fear not milady, all will go as planned. I stake my honor on that."
<br><br>
Marietta put her soft hand on his, and Beleron saw the fleshing of a smile in her cheeks.  "I stare out there Beleron, at this ocean, those stars, and do you know what I see?" At Beleron's silence she continued, her smile slowly fading, "I see a dream, a foreshadowing. The sea, just as it is now. Peaceful and shimmering, almost like a world unto it's own. And in the dream I see something else. I look up at the sky and see clouds... staring at them as they slowly blow east, toward me. Slowly they change shape, forming something. I cannot tell at first. But as the image becomes clearer, I can see it's a face." 
<br><br>
"A face?" Beleron asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, yes. But it's more than that... or less perhaps, it seems to be... a skull approaching." Marietta stopped, rubbing her arms and shoulders as a cold breeze swept past. Beleron felt her shivering.
<br><br>
"Your imagination is one to be reckoned with Marietta, always was. Since you were a child. See? Standing out here like this has got you dreaming again, let us go inside, you need rest anyhow."
<br><br>
At Beleron's prompting Marietta nodded in agreement, then replied, "You are quite right captain. Yet before either of us can rest, we must read the signs of tomorrow."
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<br>
As the door to Beleron's den rapped shut, he blurted, "Damn this mysticism Ahm has you hooked on! These dark rituals have no place aboard my ship!" His frustrated glare followed Marietta as she gathered various paraphernalia from her dresser. Marietta regarded his ranting as a mundanes ignorance.
<br><br>
"Lord Beleron, may I candidly remind you that this ships deed is held by my father Marion as well as your contract as it's captain."  Marietta replied nonchalantly as she set five red candles in a circle on the floor.
<br><br>
"Aye milady, a contract that Lord Marion will no doubt rescind when he discovers I've stolen you away without his consent."
<br><br>
The candles set, Marietta rose to collect some reagents. She snapped her fingers absently as she rummaged through her drawers, igniting the candles and appalling Beleron. She found what she was looking for, a rather heavy looking pouch of something.
<br><br>
"Can you hold this Beleron, just for a moment?" Beleron folded his arms in dogmatic stubbornness, "I'll not participate in any of thy dark rituals."
<br><br>
"Milord, please."  Marietta said as she tossed him the bag. Beleron, shocked, braced for the weight of the satchel as it landed in his arms, only to discover it was almost weightless. Bewildered, he glanced inside at the contents. The sack was filled with multitudes of glistening ebon orbs.
<br><br>
"Black diamonds?" he asked to no one in particular.
<br><br>
"Yes, a thousand." Marietta replied, flipping through a journal, "But not for spell casting. Please try not to drop any." Beleron sighed and sat in his chair. Breeze from the porthole flickered the blue flames of the candles as it rolled gently past.  Waiting for Marietta to get situated for whatever she was about to do, Beleron's apprehension slowly dwindled. He realized from the time Marietta and that mage Ahm had confronted him with their dilemma that he would have to put up with such frivolity. Still, when thinking about it, he was surprised he agreed to Marietta's pleading request to take her to Britain. He suspected ruefully that Ahm must have charmed him somehow.
<br><br>
"If these pearls are not for spell casting, then what by the virtues are they for? And why so many of them?" he expected his inquiries to go unanswered, and he was partially right for the reply was, "You'll see in just a moment." Marietta finally rested on a page in the ragged tome. Chewing her lip, her eyes peered down the flaking pages, "Ah, here it is. Let me have the bag." Beleron gladly gave it away. Marietta stood just outside the circle of five candles, closing her eyes and mouthing words alien to the stalwart captain. This episode went on for a few minutes, before she opened her eyes. Clutching the bag tightly, she suddenly exclaimed <i>"El lohir Illianth el lahi!"</i> throwing the contents of the pouch onto the floor harshly. The tiny black orbs scattered in all directions upon impact, but Beleron noted they did not spread outside the confines of the circle. Through the apparent chaos, order seemed to take grasp of the pearls as they obeyed some unheard command. In a fantastic display of cohesion the black pearls came together like ants into a formation, an image appearing.
<br><br>
As Marietta and Beleron looked on, the pearls spelled the name <i>D-R-U-S-U-S</i>.
<br><br>
Beleron stroked his mustachios, "That name, I've heard it somewhere before. What does it mean?" Marietta knelt down, thinking, "These stones tell of the future. Ahm said that only I could use them. No one can say what it means now, until fate brings it to us."
<br><br>
"Or us to it." Beleron replied. A strong gust bellowed in through the porthole and extinguished the candles. With that, the magic binding the pearls together evaporated and they began to roll apart.
<br><br>
"Quick! Catch them! We mustn't lose one!" Marietta exclaimed as she began gathering them. Beleron helped, but secretly wished the cursed stones would roll into the all-consuming sea.
<br><br>
"Now," he said firmly, "you go to bed."
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<br>
The light of dawn broke through the porthole of Beleron's cabin, resting it's orange glow on the sleeping figure of Lady Marietta.  Beleron, pausing from his map work, looked at the sight. Yes, she was beautiful, as if carved by a sculptor's hand, and Beleron marveled at how quickly the girl had grown up. He remembered her as a rambunctious child, always pestering him with questions or attention when he was called to audience by Marion. Over the years she had come to regard Beleron as an uncle, though he was actually a privateer under the service of Marion, duke of King Shaderell of Qeynos. In all the years he had known Marion's daughter, this was the first time he saw her as more than just a girl. For a moment, he saw a woman. Beleron realized he was staring, shook his head in disgust, and returned to his plotting. Just as he was beginning to concentrate, a gentle knock interrupted him. So not to disturb Marietta, he went to the door and opened. It was Jihar, his first mate.
<br><br>
"Captain, you're needed immediately," the tone in his voice was strung with tension. Beleron stepped out and closed the cabin door.
<br><br>
"Yes Jihar, what is it?" Beleron asked.
<br><br>
Jihar bit his lip and rubbed his bald head, he gestured for the captain to follow.  "Captain, we're off course." he stated simply.
<br><br>
Beleron's brow furled, "Eh?"
<br><br>
"Aye sir," he glared at the stern, the freckle faced boy who manned it the night before looked down in nervous shame, "We sailed over a cross stream, took us fifteen leagues south of our original course. Flint was at the helm last night, he should have seen that the bloody ship was moving sideways! He said he was distracted by your... passenger."
<br><br>
Beleron's eyes widened in fury, "Dammit! I'll keel haul him for this!" he grabbed his baton and began to storm up to the poop deck, Flint sprung over the railing and onto the main deck, ranting apologies and erratic pleads for forgiveness. Beleron was just a quick though, and with a long, hairy arm seized the boy by his collar. He raised the boy until he was on his toes, and posed his baton angrily to strike across Flint's back.  Jihar held him fast.
<br><br>
"Not now captain, we have other problems."
<br><br>
Beleron paused, then released boy, who scurried away like a street rat, "Explain." his tone was apprehensive.
<br><br>
"I've checked the sextant for our coordinates, we're five leagues north of the Buried Sea."
<br><br>
All motion on the ship halted. Voices stilled. All was quiet as the Fawn held her breath, awaiting the captain's next order. Beleron cursed silently, running fingers through his graying hair.
<br><br>
"Hoist every sail we have. Set a course north by northwest, hard and by on the starboard tack."  His command was echoed throughout the vessel, his crew skittering across the deck and up the masts like excited ants.  Beleron folded his arms and dropped his head worrisome thought.  The sun had risen bright over the horizon.
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<br>
"Something unexpected has happened."
<br><br>
Marietta rose, rubbing the grogginess out of her eyes. Yawning, she asked, "What is it?"
<br><br>
Beleron sighed as he planted a boot on the seat of his chair.  "We are off course. We have wandered into the realm of sea claimed by the League of Pirates."
<br><br>
Marietta gave a brief gasp, "How did this happen?"
<br><br>
"It matters not at this time. We are not in danger as of yet.  Jihar estimates we'll be out of the area within the hour. After that, all shall be well."
<br><br>
Marietta nodded, as much out of ignorance as assurance. Beleron bowed his head and left the cabin. Marietta rose from bed. She knew she would simply be in the way if she went on deck, so she brushed the splinters left by Beleron's boot off the chair and put a cushion on the seat. She sat, and thought. Her eyes wondered to the circle of candles she placed on the floor the night before. They had not been removed. Marietta pursed her lips in thought, dark hazel eyes squinted as an idea formed behind them. She grabbed her pouch of black stones, chanted a mantra under her breath and punctuated the spell with a snap of her fingers. The candles lit. Marietta stood, holding the bag. She again closed her eyes, concentrated. The words of power Ahm taught her formed on her lips.
<br><br>
"El lohir Illianth el lahi!" she exclaimed and sent the stones cascading like black rain onto the floor. They swirled in the confines of the circle, like a swarm of wasps, and coagulated into a single dark mass. Then the image took shape. It was not a name or a word this time, but a symbol. Marietta gave a deep gasp, dread filling in her eyes.
<br><br>
Upon the floor before her lay the image of a skull above crossed axes...
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<br>
"Ship ahoy! Vessel off the port stern!" The cry of the lookout reverberated throughout the ship. Everyone stopped for a moment.  Beleron looked to the crow's nest and replied, "What is it Mondi! Friend or foe!"
<br><br>
The lookout peered through his scope at the dot on the east horizon. His jaw dropped as he lowered the scope, then gave a second look before crying, "A black sail, pirates captain!" Beleron gave the signal to trim the sails.
<br><br>
"Aye, we're undone now. That blasted speck will be upon us before morning's out." Jihar and a crewmate went below to the arms lockers. Soon, everyone aboard was wielding a saber, and a few perched on the forecastle and stern sported crossbows. Beleron had gone to tell Marietta of the situation, but when he saw her he sensed she already knew. The pirates would most likely raid his cabin in search of hoarded antiques, so he hid the girl in the cargo bay amongst some empty crates. When he was back on deck, he saw that the black sail was much larger.
<br><br>
"A frigate captain, from what I can tell a crew of twenty odd."
<br><br>
"At least that places numbers on our side." Beleron replied, Jihar nodding grimly.
<br><br>
"If they don't fight for two, which is what I hear," the first mate retorted. It was almost useless to try to run.  The pirate ship sped upon them, rocking back and forth as it cut a white foam wake through the Opal Sea. As it approached, the swoosh of an arrow whipped over the deck, and the missile thunked in the center of the main mast of the <i>Fawn</i>.
<br><br>
"There's a note attached." Jihar said, snatching off a scroll tied to the arrow shaft. He handed it to Beleron. The captain grimly unrolled it and read, eyes slowly thinning to peering slits:
<br><br>
<i>Salutations from the Caspian!
<br><br>
Good day dear sea-fellows. I see that thou bear the standard of good Duke Marion. He has employed our aid in the past. Because of this, I shall give you the option of surrender. If you choose otherwise, please inform the good Duke that I was not responsible for the result of your pride.
<br><br>
Lord Cie~</i>
<br><br>
Beleron crumpled the parchment in his leathery fist and cast it on the deck angrily.
<br><br>
"Damn them! They'll not have my ship!" he shouted angrily, waving his sword at the approaching vessel and then planting it in the railing. At this, the pirates cheered a battle cry, and the <i>Caspian</i> swerved toward the <i>Fawn</i>. Beleron ordered all bulkheads locked and bolted, and set a contingent down below to guard Marietta. When he returned to the deck, the ship was peppered with arrows, and the gangplank of the <i>Caspian</i> was ready to crash into their hull. With a creak and a deep thunk the teeth of the gangplank bit into the <i>Fawn's</i> deck. With the bridge between the two ships set, a dozen pirates poured in like a herd of running bulls. Others swung on board from grapples. Beleron's crew raced to meet them, and the fight was on.
<br><br>
Down below, Marietta heard the trampling of footsteps. She stood ankle deep in freezing sea water, the chittering of rats all around keeping her company. She had attempted to sit on a crate when she first arrived in the hold, but at Beleron's prompting she saw that most of the wood was rotten and worm infested. The smell was ghastly. She would rather face pirates then languish down here, but Beleron had posted sailors in the upper hold to guard her. The trampling above was superceded by shouting, hollers, and a splash in water. The musical twanging of arrows leaping off bowstrings, the ringing of swords clashing. The orchestra of battle played on the deck. Marietta only hoped its conductor would not be struck down by the symphony. She looked around desperately, searching for some form of weapon in case the pirates made it down there. Her eyes rested on a rusty iron pot discarded in one of the crates. As Marietta reluctantly grabbed the rotten handle, tiny barnacles flaked off. The decrepit thing must have been underwater for years. She sighed, unsure of what to do next.
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<br>
<i>WHAP!</i> The sickening crack of a mace landing home danced in Beleron's ears. His opponent's knees buckled like cut wheat and he dropped straight down in a heap. Beleron wiped sweat and blood from his swelling forehead. For a moment he just stared at the dead pirate. Since the battle began, the captain surmised that this was the first enemy casualty. He retrieved his sword, which had be knocked out of his hand during the fight and briefly surveyed the scene. The rumors were right, these buccaneers did fight for two. His crew was dropping like goose during a Magincian hunting season, but that was not the worst of it. As his crew fought for dear life, the pirates seemed to battle for <i>fun</i>. Maniacs. Beleron bated his breath and leaped back into the fray. Jihar and Mondi were battling a single youthful whelp, hair wild like a raccoon's. Apparently the boy had more than his years share of battle, for he was keeping them almost on the defense. Mondi sliced at him laterally, meaning to clip the lad of his head, but the boy ducked before his attacker's blow even came close. Spinning on his knee, the youth swept out Mondi's feet and the lookout's head hit the deck with a thud. Jihar took advantage of the boy's distraction to run him through the back, but again the young pirates reflexes were quicker.
<br><br>
With a lightning flash of steel he parried Jihar's attack, spinning again to land a sharp kick to the first mate's temple. Jihar sprawled from the blow, careening across the deck and over the port railing. Before he could hear the splash of his first mate hitting the water, Beleron leaped at the boy. The pirate turned at the last moment to see Beleron's fist crack him in the center of his forehead. The youth was knocked off his feet and slid a short distance on his back. He shook his head in disorientation, squinting up to see a brawny, muscular shape of a man almost crush him under foot. The lad rolled out of the way as Belerons boot crashed on the deck. The pirate gave a swift kick to the back of Beleron's knee, toppling him. He grabbed his scimitar and hopped on his feet. Beleron struggled back up, and poised his weapon. The youth smiled mockingly as he assumed a cocky battle stance, gesturing for his enemy to attack.
<br><br>
<i>A Wood Elf</i>, Beleron thought, marking the sharp brows and pointed ears. That was why he looked so young. As the fighting around raged on, Beleron again leaped forward, meaning teach this little thief a lesson.
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<br>
Marietta pressed herself against the wall, holding the old pot like a hammer ready to strike. The commotion above had broken its way into the upper hold, and Marietta surmised it would not be long before she was discovered. The four sailors assigned to guard her left to join the fray. She was alone, the sound of incessant dripping accentuating the solitude. The pot was heavy and she lowered her guard slightly. The noise grew louder, her guards must be trying to fight the pirates back up the gangway, to no avail. A series of crashes and groans hinted that she was now unprotected. The rattling of footfalls approached. Marietta's heart went at full gallop as she raised the kitchenware to strike. A pirate busted in, knocking the door halfway off the hinges. He leaped into the middle of the room, only three feet in front of Marietta. In his apparent excitement he did not care to check behind the door or near the threshold, and Marietta pounced with a shriek. The pirate whipped around in alarm, just in time to witness Marietta's pot kiss hard on the top of his head. <I>THUNK</I>, and the buccaneer dropped like a sack of rye. Marietta, panting from fear, just stared at her victim. He was young, about her age. He sported a red bandana wrapped over his scalp, a swelling lump now protruding from the top of it. He was out cold. As the girl stared dumbfounded, two more pirates entered. Jaws dropped when they saw what the girl had done.  The shorter of the two stared at Marietta incredulously, then went to check on his fallen comrade. He grabbed the downed pirate by the chin and shook him to stir consciousness.
<br><br>
"Get up! You're embarrassing yourself!" he whispered harshly, then shouted to the other, "Secure that girl, she looks important.
<br><br>
"She's a wild one Ithaqua," the other replied, grabbing the girl by the wrist and playfully disarming her when she tried to whack him with the pot.
<br><br>
"What about Kobold?" The kneeling pirate grabbed Marietta's pot and dipped it in the large puddle, "He's not dead, I'll get him up."
<br><br>
He peered at Marietta, frowning, then poured the water over the sleeping pirate's face. Kobold started frantically, sputtering and cursing. The one called Ithaqua then discarded the pot, stood and said, "Tie her up. We have a prisoner."
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<br>
Beleron circled around his opponent clockwise, nursing an oozing weal on his right shoulder. The pirate opposing him stayed his ground, keeping face. The youth had skill, but Mondi and Jihar were not seasoned warriors, Beleron was. Though speed and agility were with the young warrior, Beleron had strength and stamina. The battle had been a near stalemate, with the stalwart captain suffering most of the wounds. But Beleron used strategy more than prowess, and he carefully gauged his opponent's moves. The boy was tired. Beleron, noting this, skidded forward in a feint. The pirate leaped back, his rear foot landing in puddle of blood and slipping out. His feet shot out from under him and he landed flat on his back. Beleron gave a war cry and pounced, his heavy cowhide boot landing squarely in the boy's chest. "Ooof..." the pirate's lungs emptied with the force of the blow. Beleron held his weapon at the boy's neck, ready for the death blow.
<br><br>
"Excellent young whelp," the captain said, "but arrogance is the boon of gods and the bane of men." The youth frowned and closed his eyes, waiting for the end. As Beleron poised his sword to strike, a bellow from the poop deck interrupted him.
<br><br>
"Prisoner!" The captain, sensing his worst fear, looked up. Sure enough, flanked by two reavers, stood a bound Lady Marietta. The crew of the Fawn, seeing the girl held captive, almost stopped fighting, unsure of what to do next. Beleron looked down at his would-be victim, the pirate smiled devilishly and pushed the sword away, "Not this time old man."
<br><br>
Beleron, glaring with anger, backed away. He threw his sword overboard, shouting, "Lower thy swords! Surrender!"
<br><br>
The fighting paused, Beleron's crew reluctant to drop their weapons. Beleron shouted again, and the swords dropped simultaneously. Breathing heavily, he looked up at Marietta, who returned his stare with eyes that betrayed her fear and sorrow.
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<br>
Most of the crew of the <i>Fawn</i>, were wiped out in the fray. The first mate had been fished out of the water shortly after the battle and sat dripping near the capstan.  Those that could stand were gathered with the rest of the captive sailors on the deck of the <i>Fawn</i>. They were bound and held under sword, but otherwise were not treated harshly. Beleron stood near the gangplank, Marietta was behind him. No one spoke... it seemed as if no one breathed. The rippling sea broke against the hull with a soft swish.  Gulls chirped in the distance. The clamor of battle had evaporated, leaving only silence. Fear trodden silence. The air was cut by a sharp footfall. A boot, and a dignified step. The step only a captain could make on the gangplank. The steps were rhythmic, musical: <i>bap... bap... bap</i>. A long serpent skin boot stepped on the deck, leathery black with a gold tip. Beleron looked up at the figure now standing before him. The captain observed Beleron flatly, betraying no expression. He was a tall, athletic affair with a red cloak draped from one shoulder, while the other was bare save a black pauldron, matching his boots. His hair was long, braided in a tail that snaked over his shoulder and dangled from his chest. Beleron studied the man.
<br><br>
He was young for a captain, his sharp goatee still crisp from youth. The pirate's placid expression broke into a sudden smile, Beleron retained his static scowl. The captain glanced over Beleron's shoulder at Marietta's fear struck expression. He ominously winked at the girl and then focused his attention on Beleron. "Greetings sir," the pirate said, bowing his head slightly, "You may call me Lord Cie."
<br><br>
Beleron smirked defiantly, "Lord? Lord of what?" The captain arched his brow, amused at the slight. He returned Beleron's smirk with one of his own, "Lord of your ship it seems, captain of the frigate <i>The Mighty Caspian</i>, lord of an estate and council member of the confederation on the Buried Sea, the League of Pirates."  Lord Cie sized Beleron up and down, stroking his chin, "I here you gave a few of my crew quite a scuffle captain, eh Tarquin?." he glanced at the pirate Beleron had battled, who was now leaning crassly against the <I>Fawn's</I> railing.
<br><br>
Young blood pursed his lips in a slight frown, "That he did." the pirate replied, stroking his shallow beard. Beleron saw from Tarquin's muscular frame that he was not a boy, but a man betrayed by a youthful face. His voice carried as far as Beleron's.
<br><br>
"But it is not of disdain or delight that I look upon him," Tarquin remarked, "just wary respect."
<br><br>
Cie nodded, "Well I smell only disdain from this noble. And I see not why, for his vessel carried no cargo, save this gentle lady," the pirate leader smiled.
<br><br>
"What will you have of us?" Beleron asked in a muttering tone.
<br><br>
"We will have you as guests," Lord Cie replied.  "Your ship will be payment for our hospitality, your ransom will be amends for our losses." The pirate stepped back onto the gangplank.
<br><br>
"We sail to the Den!"
