    tried to stop myself, I really did. But..I..just..can&#146;t..help..it. This 
    week&#146;s clue is going out on the topic of, you guessed it, gazongas. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
    was a 42-car pileup over at Lum&#146;s this week, and like every other moron 
    on the road, I had to slow down to look. The accident started out innocently 
    enough, but before it ended, it had involved 6 bald guys in hot sports cars, 
    2 cattle trucks full of dairy cows with enormous udders, twenty-six teenaged 
    boys driving without a license, half the cast of Cirque de Soleil, eight big-haired 
    bimbos headed out for some hot two-stepping action, and a Shriner car full 
    of evil midget clowns. I skipped around the threads reading various posts 
    and groaning, laughing or dozing off in all the appropriate places. I thought 
    the accident was over and the towtrucks were moving in. I was wrong. The official 
    emergency vehicle finally showed up, but the driver just couldn&#146;t stop 
    in time. He crashed into 18 of the other cars, starting a domino reaction. 
    The guy is currently in stable, but serious condition. Here it is in all its 
    <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/forums/read.php?f=95&amp;t=8616&amp;i=8616&amp;p=0">gory 
    splendor</a>. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    Here&#146;s what happened. Apparently Asheron&#146;s Call added a new piece 
    of woman&#146;s clothing to the game, and it was a real cowsuit - something 
    you have to tuck yourself back into every time you bend down to loot a critter. 
    Some woman named Lietgardis wrote a rant about it for Lum&#146;s site. And 
    then the world exploded. Just kidding. Kinda. Lietgardis&#146; issue is at 
    least worth a mention&#133;I dunno if it&#146;s worth a whole rant, but at 
    least I understand her issue, which is more than I can say for the majority 
    of the posters. What IS worth a rant, however, is the official response to 
    it, which has to be the WORST official response to any gaming issue I&#146;ve 
    seen in at least 10 years. Barely anyone understood the rant for the first 
    15 pages of posts, because when it comes to computer games, people tend to 
    get their knickers so twisted up that it cuts off the supply of blood to their 
    brain, so here&#146;s the rant, paraphrased and shortened, in non-game terms. 
    Everyone remain calm and stand behind the yellow line till the short bus comes 
    to a full stop.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    happen to be a woman, and one of my favorite recreational things to do is 
    to go out for dinner. I go out for dinner with my friends maybe 4 times a 
    week because I like not having to cook or do dishes after working all day. 
    But I live in a VERY small town and there are only three restaurants here. 
    One of them is Hooters, where all the waitresses wear horrible bright orange 
    polyester hot pants and t-shirts that are 3 sizes too small and bounce energetically 
    up to your table. (I think the Jell-O company owns a major share in this chain). 
    One of them is a theme restaurant based on Comedy Central&#146;s The Man Show, 
    and features &#147;Juggies&#148; jumping up and down on trampolines as entertainment. 
    The third one is a nudie bar, but they&#146;ve got a pretty decent chef there. 
    I&#146;m not crazy about these places. Oh, they&#146;re ok once in a while, 
    but hell, what&#146;s the attraction for women in a restaurant featuring naked 
    women? There&#146;s nothing there for ME to ogle, and there&#146;s little 
    chance for decent dinner conversation in a place like that. But because the 
    food is ok, and because I like to go out to dinner, I go to them. I&#146;ve 
    got no choice. I guess the majority of the customers must like them pretty 
    well, because they seem to do a good amount of business. I notice that most 
    of the customers are young guys, some of whom are really loud and rude, but 
    there are some other people there like me, just eating dinner and trying to 
    ignore the comments and the occasional interruption in their meal when one 
    of the main attractions slips its halter and flops into the soup.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
    day a new restaurant opens up in my town and my friends and I go in for dinner, 
    and I&#146;m surprised to see that the place doesn&#146;t feature scantily 
    clad staff of either sex, and the d&eacute;cor is interesting, and well, it 
    seems to actually be about food and conversation. I think this is great, it&#146;s 
    a huge relief and I begin to patronize this restaurant almost exclusively. 
    The food&#146;s not quite as good, and the place doesn&#146;t have as many 
    patrons as the other ones, but the regular crowd there likes it quite a bit. 
    The manager tells me that he thinks it&#146;s important that people have a 
    place to go eat dinner that doesn&#146;t have tatas on the menu, and I&#146;m 
    glad to hear it. One night my friends and I go in to dinner, and the place 
    has changed. Most of the female staff members are now wearing babydoll t-shirts, 
    and they&#146;ve started selling them as well, up near the cash register. 
    My reaction might be best described as - &#147;Awwww, crap. Here we go again.&#148; 
    I ask to speak to the manager and voice my complaint and my concern that he&#146;s 
    blown it, he&#146;s sold out, that there is no longer one restaurant in town 
    where a woman can go for dinner that isn&#146;t a boobfest. Here&#146;s what 
    the manager says to me in reply:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    (Note: The manager in this case is Sean Huxter, the artist who designed the 
    infamous Daemondress. Translation of his reply into the restaurant analogy 
    is courtesy of yours truly.)</font></p>

    <i>I understand Leitgardis' original post, its entire intent, and her feelings 
    about the dress' addition into her safe environment. </i></font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    I understand your point, and I know you really looked forward to eating in 
    a restaurant without someone shoving her knockers in your face every 10 minutes.</font></div>

    do NOT agree with it. </i></font></p>

    play almost exclusively female characters. Yes. It's true. I just happen to 
    LIKE women more than men. Playing a female character is NOT some bizarre manifestation 
    of some latent homosexuality, nor some cry of need for a mother I never knew 
    or any such nonsense. I just like women better than I like men. (Sorry guys!)

    like to pretend that I&#146;m a woman sometimes. This does NOT make me gay, 
    not that there&#146;s anything WRONG with being gay, some of my best friends 
    are gay. I like women better than men. This means that I&#146;m qualified 
    to tell you what women are entitled to get pissed off about.</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="center"> 
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>So 
    we designed four dresses. We did three conservative dresses for the women 
    who, while wanting to look female and feminine, did NOT want to look overtly 
    sexual. Then we tossed one in for those who did. </i></font></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
    let me make this clear. THERE ARE THOSE WHO DID! </font></i></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
    eliminate this choice from them made no sense to me, just to ensure that the 
    women playing who did NOT want to be taunted were secure in their non-sexual 
    roles. Please. Go ahead and continue to be secure in your non-sexual roles 
    by not wearing that particular dress. </font></i></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
    hired some waitresses from those other places and they complained that their 
    tit..err..their TIPS weren&#146;t as good here. They wanted to dance naked 
    on the tables so people would give them more money. The waitresses WANTED 
    this. If you are against this change, you are depriving them of their CHOICE 
    to shove their tits in patrons&#146; faces. If you don&#146;t want to buy 
    the T-shirt at the register, then DON&#146;T buy it and then you won&#146;t 
    have to worry about anyone making rude remarks about YOUR tits.</font></div>

  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I 
    also highly suspect that BECAUSE of this thread and its uproar, more people 
    in-game are now more likely to approach someone in that dress and say &quot;Hey, 
    nice tits.&quot; I seriously do. Because they know they will be upsetting 
    someone. Those people exist. Sad but true. Any hint of controversy brings 
    them out. And this is one STINKER of a controversy - over nothing. </i></font></p>

    them! We added a LOT of tits to our d&eacute;cor so all you women would feel 
    right at home, cause you have tits too. We COULD have made the restaurant 
    appeal more towards women by having it professionally decorated, and some 
    people have had a lot of luck with this approach, but since I dress up as 
    a woman, I know what you women really want and that&#146;s jugs, and lots

    four of the choices are titty bars? Nobody&#146;s saying you can&#146;t have 
    a choice.</font></div>

    as I see it. And as others are apparently seeing it. Your original intent 
    is lost within your reasoning and follow-ups. As I stated before, I fully 
    undersand your original intent, but your words have belied it. There seems 
    to be something far more deep and emotional about this dress that distresses 
    you, not just the fact that you think it's going to pollute your safe environment.

    all her time in a place that&#146;s wall-to-wall tits. And all these other 
    people agree with me so I must be right. So we&#146;re going to try to make 
    you explain to us why women get tired of hanging around with tits, which is 
    a clever move on our part because then we can call you a selfish fat bitch, 
    a lesbian, and a commienazipinko, and then make fun of you when you complain 
    about it. In fact, I&#146;ll go so far as to say that women who DON&#146;T 
    like to spend their leisure time in a place filled with other naked women 
    must have something terribly WRONG with them. I think you need psychoanalysis, 
    or maybe a double dose of Midol.</font></div>
