          Perched comfortably in a tree, Ziff watched the goblins work. They disgusted 
          him. Slouching green humanoids with potbellies, their entire wardrobe 
          consisted of revealing loincloths and gaudy brass jewelry. Even from 
          his hiding place some yards away, he was sure he could smell their vile 
          stench.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ziff 
          had arrived in Rivervale barely six months ago, exhausted from his travels 
          as a journeyman enchanter. Moving from town to town, he had earned a 
          modest living enchanting farmer tools, blacksmith metals, and, on occasion, 
          weapons. But rigorous travel, though ripe with its own rewards, takes 
          its toll on the body. When he at last stumbled into the comfortable 
          hamlet of Rivervale, he needed a break.</font></p>

          past week a friend send me an icq message with a link to an article 
          on a new lawsuit filed in Colorado against Ultima Online on behalf of 
          its volunteers who supposedly were enslaved in a virtual sweatshop, 
          laboring unpaid on behalf of Electronic Arts&#146; bottom line. Not 
          long ago, I also followed the links on the Vault to articles about a 
          similar suit against AOL alleging it too had mistreated its volunteers 
          by not paying them in order to pad its already fabulous bottom line.

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently 
          I had an event happen in my life. Perhaps not so recently as it was 
          actually shortly following the Vegas EQ trip in July. My hubby&#146;s 
          family had a crisis and I have had to be in another city except for 
          three or four days out of a month. This sojourn has provided me with 
          a step back from EverQuest, and one I didn&#146;t particularly want. 
          When the crisis came I was becoming even more heavily involved in the 
          community than ever before and enjoying the heck out of the interaction 
          it provided with all of you. In fact one of my last logged times on 
          Oxesiess can easily be ranked as one of the highlights of playing her 
          (the &#147;fans&#148; were just too dang cute and great role-players 
          that I met at the bank {waves}).</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
          a brief time in my life I was responsible for managing people. I worked 
          as an assistant manager for a Crown Books store. Posted in the bathroom, 
          right over the back of the toilet, was a poster that we had been given 
          and told that we had to post where all employees could see it. It&#146;s 
          been ten years or more since I read that poster. But it was printed 
          by the U.S. Government and it, basically, outlined some of the rights 
          of employees in the United States.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes 
          isn't it quite entertaining to see how real-life events change the game 
          from time to time? Sometimes I wish all those people who use EverQuest 
          for making other's life harder would encounter a real-life problem, 
          to open their eyes and to see what it's all about. Paradise is, when 
          all players finally see that EverQuest is something, that can help you 
          to maintain your sanity. I have made many friends since I play it and 
          they already helped me to get over my real-life problems. It doesnt 
          help me to close my eyes and ignore reality, but it helps to deal with 
          it.</font></p>
