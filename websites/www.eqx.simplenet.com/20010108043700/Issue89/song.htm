From beneath the free city <br>
   comes a dark maiden of elven beauty <br>
   She walks in the shadows with such grace <br>
   an impish smile she keeps on her face 
<br><br>
   She met an ogre warrior <br>
   that made his way past her heart's barrier <br>
   She fell in love with his soul <br>
   for countless ages foretold 
<br><br>
   But another also loved the maiden <br>
   a human wizard whose expressions harden <br>
   He would not accept that she'd love another <br>
   his jealousy pushed him even further 
<br><br>
   He cursed the ogre and the elf <br>
   so for all time, in sickness and health <br>
   Never would they touch, embrace or kiss <br>
   so their physical emotions she would miss 
<br><br>
   But their love for each other, their gentle stare <br>
   Their eyes held the flame that always would flare <br>
   She would not give the wizard what he wants <br>
   for her heart belongs to a man he couldn't taunt 
<br><br>
   Today their love grows even more <br>
   As they search for a cure among the lore <br>
   As they exchange their vows and their rings.... <br>
   At this wedding I wish you both all the happiness the gods can bring. 
<br><br>
 "Your love is deep. How could we ignore it?  We should all help you find the way to finally hold each other."
