The following is a little known passage from the New Testament, found recently by scholars. The contents are astounding:
<br><br>
<em>Teirlap, 3:12</em>
<br><br>
In the beginning, there was Aradune. Aradune was almighty, at least in his own mind, and he set out to create a beautiful 3D rendered land. It had plains, deserts, oceans, caves, mountains, and dungeons. He decided to name the land Norrath.

&quot;Followers of Bristlebane believe in having fun, at the expense of nearly all else. Bards, rogues, jesters, gamblers and gypsies are all typical followers. They are almost always very charming, clever, and witty, traits which all Bristlebane followers should strive to have. Mischief in all its forms is encouraged. Practical jokes are performed as if they are the highest of rituals. Very few of Bristlebane's followers are outright wicked in their desires but it is best to keep at least one eye on your purse if they are about. And never let one deal you a hand of King's Court.&quot;

There is a point beyond exhaustion, where you know that your feet can hurt no longer and where your lungs simply fulfill their obligation to the rest of your body, unable to do anything but push and pull at the icy air again and again.  That's not to say that if you run long and far enough you can keep running forever; Quite the opposite.  I knew that once I'd reached that point that it wasn't much longer before I'd collapse and that one of my pursuers would find me.

It's a tough week to write an editorial.  Two weeks ago I had a problem downloading patches, and couldn't play.  All this week I've been in classes, and my head has been far too full of... stuff... to think of playing EverQuest.  Actually, maybe that's something worth talking about...

Some quick thoughts that came up this week:
<br><br>
I created another new character.  I wanted to test out how many rude or greedy people I ran across in the course of creating a character.  After about 6 hours of play, My character is 5th level, and has been given outright 4 pieces of bronze armor, bought a crysknife for only 5pp, and has been buffed to the gills several times by helpful players <em>unasked</em><b>...</b>

This is in regards to the Straylight Saga happening on the realm known as 
Rallos Zek.  My name is Kallystra and many of you may know me from my 
weekly articles in this very site.  I am also a participant of the 
Straylight Saga on Rallos Zek and I am the child in question who was (and 
still is) the Daughter of Innoruuk (although the storyline in this has yet 
to show that).  Let me basically tell what happened before, during, and 
after this issue.
