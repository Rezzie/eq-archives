          is the only way I can describe my desire to re-create the circumstances 
          of my father&#146;s death. Since my near demise in the clutches of bad 
          weather, the Spirit of Wolves has dogged my steps. After learning from 
          my mother that the Wolf Spirit appeared on the day of my father&#146;s 
          death, I became convinced that she bore some unhealthy interest in my 
          family. This notion eventually led me to the Surefall Glade, where I 
          hoped to make more sense of my involvement with the spirit.</i></font></p>

          far my efforts had been in vain. No one left alive knows why Robert 
          Ross went to Surefall, when his family was imperiled by plague. My father&#146;s 
          death still seems to be the work of illness.</font></i></p>

          had been staring at it for quite some time. She couldn't tell how long 
          it had been, and she didn't care. It hypnotized her, the delicate cuts; 
          someone had spent a long time on it. The blood was still fresh. She 
          leaned closer and smelled. The wonderful smell of death filled her nostrils, 
          oh yes this had been done recently. It was a corpse, or what was left 
          of one. The eyes were gouged out, the tongue removed from the mouth, 
          the throat slit, and the arms and legs were nowhere to be found. It 
          was the remains of what appeared to be a priest of life. But what made 
          this particular carcass so appealing was the incisions made on the chest. 
          It was writing, carved into the rotting flesh.</font></p>

          players on Brell Serilis and from my (and my husband's) own observations, 
          what he's looking for would be very difficult.</font></p>

          time does indeed stop whenever the servers go down. So, any program
