I know some of my articles are way off the mark regarding the theme of this
magazine, but sometimes I feel compelled to let you know just what a geek I
am, or share some experiences that I have had, you might benefit from.  Some
of you are getting ready to graduate high school, or graduate from college.
I want to share with you some techniques I used to find a job.

<em>The focus will be on a job as a MIS or Network profession, but you could
really apply this to any trade.</em>

<b>Creating Your Resume</b>
<br><br>
The first impression I have of you will come from your application / resume.
Your resume should be short, no more than one page.  Most of you will not
have much experience to write about, so I recommend you stick to this
format.
<br><br>
1. Your personal info<br>
2. Your goal statement<br>
3. Skills<br>
4. Hobbies<br>

Your <u>goal statement</u> (#2) is very important.  This is a one-paragraph
explanation of what you want to accomplish by working for my company.
Below is my goal statement.   Notice the use of  "growth".   Use phrases
like "high growth", "high profits", "maximize value", innovative and
entrepreneurial".
<br><br>
<b><em>Goal Statement</b></em>
<br><br>
<em>To find a position that promotes continual growth in Intranet networking,
so that I may support that position with my growing networking experience.</em>
