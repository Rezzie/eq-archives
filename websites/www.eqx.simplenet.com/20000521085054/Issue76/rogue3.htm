<b>Part Three</b>
     <br><br>
Kinory was 17, a silent and bitterly mature girl, when the final letter came.  It was not written by Gwyn, nor delivered by the battered messengers that always brought his words to their door.  Kinory was not home when it arrived, but she knew, from the moment she saw the human sitting awkwardly in their parlor, that her hope that she would see Gwyn again had died.
<br><br>
The Human was dressed in a travel-worn but still impressive uniform, and on his breastplate, the emblem of the Freeport Militia shone in bright color.  Maya sat opposite him, her body stiff, her eyes gazing unseeingly into the distance, and her father stood uncomfortably beside her.  Both he and the soldier looked up at Kinory's entrance.  She stopped in the door, eyes going from the Human to her mother to Holyd.
<br><br>
   "Kinory," Holyd began.
<br><br>
   "I think I know," she said, before her throat closed over her tears.  She swallowed, her eyes going to her mother again.  Her father put a hand on Maya's shoulder, and she moved finally, to shrug it away.  Her eyes closed.  One tear ran down her cheek.
<br><br>
   "Well," said the Human.  "I'm very sorry for your loss.  If I can do anything more…"  
<br><br>
   "You've done enough," Holyd cut him off.  He nodded, and stood.
<br><br>
   "I will be going then.  Again, I do apologize for being the bearer of such bad news.  He was a fine, brave warrior.  Good day to you."
<br><br>
   The front door closed gently.  Holyd came over to Kinory, holding out a folded white parchment.
<br><br>
   "The letter," he said brusquely.  She reached out a numb hand and took it.  He went past her and left the room.
<br><br>
   Kinory closed her burning eyes for a moment, and then opened the letter.  
<br><br>
<center>"We regret to inform you...."</center>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   The words blurred, but she could not look away, could not help reading it through to the end.   Gwyn was dead.
<br><br>
   "I'm leaving," she said.  Her voice sounded rough and foreign to her.  "Today.  Now."  She dropped the letter on the floor.  Her mother never looked up.  
<br><br>
    Kinory left the house, blindly running away, her tears coming freely now.  She looked up to find herself in front of the tavern where she'd met Daryth two years before.  A dream-like feeling swept over her, as if she could open the door and escape into the past.  Daryth would be there, and Gwyn would still be alive, and... she pushed at the swinging door and entered.  When she saw the familiar form slumped against the bar in that particular pose, she thought for a brief second that she <em>had</em> stepped backward in time.  Then Daryth looked up at her.  His eyes widened and then crinkled in a grin. 
<br><br>
   "Well, hello again, M'lady," he said.  His voice was that same rasp.  She paused in the doorway, struggling with the unexpected fulfillment of two years worth of dreaming.  "What, no welcome for an old friend?"  He straightened slightly, and nodded to the seat next to him.  She came forward.  He leaned toward her and brushed at a tear with the ball of his thumb.  "Still believing in stories, I see," he said quietly.  She only stared mutely at him.  He lifted a finger to the innkeep, who brought her a cup of wine.  "What's up, my dear?  What cherished dream of yours got crushed today?"
<br><br>
   "No dream," she answered, her voice husky.  "My brother..." Unable to finish, she laid her head on her arms and sobbed.
<br><br>
   "Hey, now," said Daryth.  He stroked her hair.  "This would be the Militia man you were so proud of then would it?"  She nodded wordlessly.  "Dangerous profession, that."
<br><br>
   "He... the letter said lost in action, no body found... but they know he's dead.  They found parts of his uniform, and..."  She turned her face away.  
<br><br>
   "I see," said Daryth.  She looked at him, an idea forming in her head.  He drew back slightly, a wary expression on his face.  "What does that unholy light in your emerald eyes forebode?" he asked.
<br><br>
   "Take me with you," she demanded.
<br><br>
   "Pardon me?"  he asked, tilting his head.
<br><br>
   "When you go.  I am finished here.  Take me with you!"
<br><br>
   "You are crazed with grief," he said, crossing his arms. "You don't know what you're saying.  Take you with me?"
<br><br>
   "Yes!  I want... I want to be a Rogue, to join your gang.  What did you train me for if not for this?"
<br><br>
   "I was bored, and playing idly with an impressionable young hellion," he said coolly.  "You haven't got the slightest comprehension of what it is you are asking."  He leaned forward.  "All you know is that you are unhappy, and you think that you can leave it behind as easily as you shuck a pair of shoes.  Life doesn't work that way, my dear.  Wherever you go, you will still just be yourself."
<br><br>
   "I know that.  It isn't me I want to leave behind." Her gaze challenged him.  He looked indecisive for an instant, and then shook his head firmly.
<br><br>
   "No."  She opened her mouth in protest, and he silenced her.  "No!"  She glared at him for a long silent moment, and then spun and ran out.  
<br><br>
   Daryth watched her go, shaking his head.  
<br><br>
   Kinory went home, and climbed up the wall to her bedroom window.  She slipped inside, and hauling a backpack out of her wardrobe, she threw clothing and a few of her more prized possessions into it.  Her lockpicks.  A small bag containing a few gold pieces.  She crept quietly downstairs and opened her father's chest silently.  She lifted the packet of Gwyn's unread letters and tucked it away.   Her hand hovered over her mother's Ranger guild tunic for a long moment before she swept it into the bag.  A small wash-leather sack in the corner of the trunk caught her eye, and lifted it.  Coins clinked heavily within.  She loosened the drawstrings and gasped.  It was full to the brim with platinum.  She weighed it in her hand, heart pounding.  Where had her father gotten so much money?  It was a fortune.  She didn't dare take it all.  At last, she took twenty, and stuffed them hurriedly on top of her gold.  She slung her pack over her shoulder, and without a look back, went out into the night.  
<br><br>
   Above, watching from a second story window, Maya watched her daughter leave as she had watched on many a night.  Her heart ached within her, and her eyes followed Kinory as she faded into the night.  When she was at last gone, and Maya's straining sight could no longer pick out her slight form, she turned from the window and went back to bed.  Holyd shifted as she slipped between the covers.  Her eyes stared dryly into the darkness.  She envied Kinory's courage and will to leave, and knew that once, she could have done the same.  That woman seemed dead now, buried under shame and fear.  Maya watched the dark long into the night.
<br><br>
   She skulked on top of the warehouse attached to the inn, watching the place with hawk eyes.  Late that night, when the dark was just beginning to give way in the east to the pale glow of dawn, she was roused from an uneasy slumber by the scrape of a boot in the street below.  Cursing herself for her inattention, she leaned over and saw a shadowy figure move stealthily along the side of the inn.  She rose silently to her feet, and followed him, tracking him from the rooftops.  He led her to a secluded spot on the western edge of the city, where he flung a rope over the side and slid quickly down to the forest floor.  She dropped down to the ramp below and cautiously approached the edge.  She did a slow count of twenty, and looked over to see him vanishing into the forest.  As he entered the trees, he glanced back.  She had no real doubt that she was following the Rogue, but his face showed clearly for a second and she smiled to herself.  Daryth disappeared into the trees.  His rope was still tied to the low fence at the edge of the platform.  She regarded it with suspicion, and then gave it a gentle tug just below the knot.  It came loose easily, falling through the air with a soft whisper and coiling on the ground below.  She shook her head.
<br><br>
   "Did you think I would fall for that one?"  she murmured.  She judged the distance to the ground and licked her lips.  She'd practiced her safefall religiously, but it was farther than she had ever tried to leap before.  "Nothing ventured..." she told herself, and grasping the wooden edge, lowered herself slowly to hang from it.  Her breath coming in short pants, she closed her eyes and imagined her entire body limp, relaxed her muscles and then let go.  Her stomach leapt up inside her, there was a brief sensation of wind, and then she hit the ground.  She bent her knees, absorbing the impact, and rolled.  She came up grinning triumphantly.  Her ankles stung, and her stomach seemed suspended in the air above her head, but she was otherwise unhurt.  Bending to the ground, she quickly picked up the traces of Daryth's tracks.  They were faint, almost unreadable, but she was not the daughter of a Ranger for nothing.
<br><br>  
   She left Kelethin behind, and followed the Rogue into the shadowed woods.
