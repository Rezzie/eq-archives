Level 2
<br><br>
Skill: start% / max %
<br><br>
Swordsmanship: 25% / 50%<br>
Polearms skill: 25% / 40%<br>
Archery: 10% / 25%<br>
Shield parry: 45% / 65%<br>
Tracking: 0% / 15%<br>
Riding: 0% / 30%
<br><br>
Note that the start % would go up for some skills.  Even if you had not used your pole arm skill and improved it that way, the gaining of the level would push it up a little.
<br><br>
Level 5
<br><br>
Skill: start% / max %
<br><br>
Swordsmanship: 35% / 70%<br>
Polearms skill: 35% / 60%<br>
Archery: 10% / 45%<br>
Shield parry: 55% / 75%<br>
Tracking: 0% / 35%<br>
Riding: 0% / 50%
<br><br>
Disarm: 0% / 20%<br>
Endurance:  0% / 30%
<br><br>
Note that by level 5 the skill caps would raise more slowly, while some of the minimums might raise at the same rate.  Also at this level a few more skills become available.  Upon reaching 5th level the player can choose one new skill (they also got one at 3rd) from the now expanded list of optional skills.

Etc.  This system should allow for a variety of character types within the classes while still holding each class to its nature.  With careful tweaking it should be balanced as well.
<br><br>
<em>[FL_Ingwe]</em>  What (if any) innate abilities does the ogre have besides pure strength and stamina?
<br><br>
<em>[DrBunny]</em>  I'll give you two -- the ability to body slam their opponent, and also bash doors. 
<br><br>
<em>Me:</em>  I guess I had never really thought about racial abilities.  I guess I just assumed that elves would see in the dark and halflings would be able to fit into small places.  But there are some implications in the way Brad answers this one.  I get an impression that there will be a lot more of these things than we might have expected.  Just think of the coolness of a big fat Ogre being able to toss you across the street with a belly slam!  Think even further about the idea that a Troll could actually smell an approaching Elf.  A Dwarf might be able to literally walk for hours without stopping.  I guess this one struck me because it implies a lot of things that I never really thought about.

<em>*FL_Zealot*</em> How severe will the NDA be? For example, can we maintain journals of our beta adventures if we do not make specific technical references or include pictures? 
<br><br>
<em>[DrBunny]</em>  The NDA for the first few phases will have to be very strict, which means no information regarding the game can be published.
<br>
<em>Me:</em>  Drats!  That’s it, just drats.  :)

<br><br>

<em>*EoNXaphoo*</em> Mr. McQuaid: Will EverQuest allow rogues or perhaps other classes to use aliases or change their names or appearance? Perhaps through a skill?
<br><br>
<em>[DrBunny]</em>  We're working on something like that, but aren't sure if it will make it in the first release.
<br><br>
<em>Me:</em>  The disguise concept is a huge one, and one of my pet ideas.  It really requires a lot of stuff be in place before it can be implemented and has a lot of great implications.  First there will need to be ways to peek through the disguises.  Spells and skills.  Then there will likely need to be some sort of "skins" for this skill.  And of course there will be spells to duplicate this ability…  I could do several pages on this skill alone.  I am glad to see that they are working on it.
<br><br>
Heck, there were many more interesting questions and answers during that chat.  I wonder what 
the chat formats will be like <em>after</em> the beta starts...
