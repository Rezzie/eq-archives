<em>Residents were shocked by an experiment gone awry that literally shook the foundations of their homes</em>
<br><br>
Hoi there all ... Lrets D'pearl here with a report from far away Felwithe. Residents of this quiet community were shocked and scared literally out of their homes and beds, or whatever they were doing, when a magical experiment went severely out of control. Sources within the Nexus of the Art tell us that researchers in the Hall of Magic were engaging in magical experiments to determine whether it may be possible to communicate with the spirits that reside deep within the city. These magic users got much more than they bargained for. Apparently, a bippity boo, instead of a bippity bop, was slipped into the incantation involved and ended up amplifying the power of the spell. What was the result of this seemingly harmless slip ye ask? Well, upon completion of the corrupted spell, the city spirit was indeed awakened. However, the error in the spell did not remove the discorporate portion of the spirit from the city. Thus ... for lack of a better term to use the poor citizens of Felwithe had to deal with the sudden ... errr .. transformation of the city into a great humanoid golem.

                    <em>Citizens of Felwithe were astounded when their beautiful city suddenly transformed into a gargantuan humanoid Golem</em>
					<br><br>
Sources also reveal that the backlash of the spell awoke spirits in other inanimate objects. One local resident even witnessed a wagon cart "transform" into a strange humanoid golem and cry out a wierd incantation to the city. 
<br><br>
    "I could not make out exactly what the wagon cried out .. but it sounded something like ... 'Omega Supreme follow me! This must be a Deceptagon trick! Transformers .. roll 'em out!!! ' , and then a bunch of the golems changed back into wagons and rolled after the city as it lumbered off into the ButcherBlock Mountians!"
When approached for questioning, the leaders of the Nexus of the Art were not available for comment. In the meantime, local residents try to piece back their severely disrupted lives and get back to the chore of cleaning up the mess and rebuilding the city.
