The location of the cave did not change since Yari had left, but its 
inhabitants had. Although eerily quiet, Raylend sensed a strong evil presence 
that could only come from an entire horde of creatures. He cautiously made 
his way inside, and as his eyes adjusted to the light, he stopped in his 
tracks. Along the walls, and shadowing both exits of the cave, he saw gnolls. 
Dozens of the doglike humanoids were frozen in place. Raylend guessed 
correctly that the Gnolls had made a home here, but somehow had come under an 
enchantment of their own. Krysthanir, he thought. Taking a careful breath, 
he proceeded into the cavern.

The caves certainly smelled like a doghouse, and everywhere he went, 
the gnolls lined the way. The constant evil presence not only made Raylend 
uneasy, but also made it difficult to find his way. However, the gnolls had 
constructed quite a home for themselves, and so he stuck to the main path. 
A chill went through his spine every time he had to brush against one of 
the frozen guards to pass by it. Upon the walls, he saw symbols made of 
circles, and decided they must be paw prints to denote the Gnoll home. 
<br><br>
His thought was abruptly shaken as he saw movement before him. The 
snake! It was approaching him with unusual speed. He raised his sword and 
took a defensive stance, letting it come to him. This was what he was here 
for.

Suddenly, a new thought occurred to him. Perhaps it was Krysthanir 
implanting this thought into his mind, or perhaps his own paranoia finally 
caught up with him. The hundreds of Gnolls he had passed were between him 
and the exit. If the snake had caused their paralysis, its death would 
surely release them of their eternal prisons. If he killed the snake, 
Raylend knew he would be trapped with no chance of escape. He could run, 
and maybe plot some way to attack the snake in the open, but somehow he 
knew that he would not get that chance. Krysthanir grew more powerful with 
each passing day.  The paralysis it maintained on the gnolls would not be
necessary for much longer, but while it was active, it sapped most of the 
snakes power.  He had to fight now, or forever let it be. The choice was 
easy.

Every man has a test of greatness, he thought, and this was his...
