"Oh where oh where has the role-playing gone?"  This is a common heard Lament of the role-player in EverQuest.  To answer the question, I do not know.  Many say it's the lack of others role-playing.  Fair enough.  However if that is the case, why haven't I seen it?
<br><br>
I have seen certain servers have more role-playing encounter for encounter, but I find it incredibly ODD that it's the role-players using such a determined no-question-about-it voice when saying this.  The other grumble often heard is how hard it is for role-players to meet other role-players.  Again, why haven't I seen this?
<br><br>
A statement was made to me awhile ago when I asked a friend this very same question.  The answer I received took me back.  "It's kind of hard NOT to role-play with your character Onnie."  I had to stop and really think about that.
<br><br>
For reference, let me explain my main character "Oxesiess".  I play a She-Barb Warrior who's not too bright.  She is in complete awe of her tribe's "Holy Ones" for they make things go "Boom" and can do the "Purrty Sparkles dat feel good" after she's finished "Bashy".  One of her quirks is that she loves "Lil uns".  Despite the Holy Ones explanation's, she is still confused why "Lil uns gots ta sit down when dey so close ta da ground".  She's kind of like a cuddly Great Dane.  Well, a Great Dane with a Blood Lust problem.  Her two purposes are "Bashy" or "MORE BASHY!" and "Protect da Holy One!"  Even with these two very ingrained views, Oxes desperately wants to understand the world, but probably never will.  She is unable to rise up and view it.  Instead she brings things she doesn't understand, which is just about everything that doesn't involve a weapon, down to her level.  In short, she makes very absurd, but well meant, statements.
<br><br>
The first approach I took to understanding the view expressed by my friend was the make up of my character.  I don't mean Oxes being a barb warrior.  I looked at what makes the character tick.  Personality, conversation, and opinions might make it easy for Non role-players to just naturally fall into character when responding to statements from Oxes.  I quickly tossed that aside.  Most people don't enjoy conversations with the less-than-bright.  Also, Oxes has her own lingo. So when she opens her mouth and people hear her, they should come to some very fast conclusions.  Either I am the WORST speller alive, I am foreign with very very very little english training, or I am role-playing.  Obviously since I have no problem understanding their statements, I could easily copy their spelling of "They" vs. my "dey", and Oxes very absurd statements, I find it hard to believe that people don't realize that role-playing is involved.  Yet, I have had only two bad encounters on my server.
<br><br>
One was a Shaman who kill stole two monsters from me and became very rude to my question of, "Why da Holy One do dat?".  I believe it was an accident. This was back during the super bad packet loss days.  A week later I zoned into Black Burrow to see him walking towards the zone line with an Elite on his back. I jumped right in and pulled it off him with a hit and a taunt, and asked "Iffen da Holy One okay dokay".  He got out a "help" and I killed it.  I sat down to heal and said nothing more.  He then started healing and buffing me.  Now I KNOW he had to have recognized me. During our previous exchange, he had done several tells cussing at me. Oxesiess isn't something, as I am told by my friends, that's typed out on the fly.  I of course thanked the Holy One for healing me.  This player just stood there in front of me.  I think he didn't know what to type but felt he should as he would have never have made it to the zone line if I hadn't jumped in.  Instead of rehash, I just said "No Holy One deserves ta die ta da dog face. Not while Oxes is round!"  His response was "I shall make sure when I am back in Halas to tell the Tribunal of your deeds."
<br><br>
I have no doubt in my mind, this guy was NOT a role-player.  Our argument before on his end had been completely OOC and even involved him using /shout to yell at me when he got sick of typing in my name.  Yet, there it was before me in white letters from him, a role-playing statement.  I bumped into several times after that.  He would always speak to me in character.
<br><br>
I am ALMOST sure there has to be someone out there reading thinking "Your nuts lady for saving a player who cussed you out!".  Actually, I don't think so.  I'd like to point out a few things:
<br><br>
<ol>
	<li>I could have just run by him as I was just passing through Black  Burrow.  Yes, I COULD have done that, despite the smaller barbs fixing to zone in behind me.<br><br>
	<li>I could have stood and watched him die to it, and warned the smaller barbs.  OH! what wonderful revenge right?  Not my feeling.  If he truly was the rude jerk I first encountered, he would have NEVER of understood such an action.  Rather he would have felt more justified in his first action of verbal abuse. In fact, I get the odd feeling this player now felt like a smuck for his previous behavior.  I honestly didn't expect anything from him. Not heals, buffing, or even a thank you. The action was only for my own personal satisfaction on several levels.  My actions also happened to be COMPLETELY in character.  Lucky me.
</ol>

The next thought I had on the "it's not hard to role-play with you" was, Oxes is friendly.  Well there's a lot of friendly people.  There's a lot of just darn NICE people.  That doesn't mean they will role-play.  Yet at 5:00 am CST, I can fire up Oxes, walk into Qeynos bank, see a half-elf bard standing behind the counter, ask him if he's a new banker and:
<br><br>
 Half-Elf:  Honest it's only part time until I can afford a new lute.<br>
 Half-Elf:  Next person please.
<br><br>
I stuck around for about 15 minutes just to wake my hubby up from laughing out loud.  The Half-Elf tried to serve player after player that came in.  I couldn't figure out which had me rolling the most.  Him or the other players walking in and role-playing back with him.
<br><br>
With the encounters from the bank, to some place as hectic as Black Burrow, to sitting for healing on the white bridge in North Karana and getting up to move next to the only other person in the zone saying, "I's scarit. Da place empty and dat's when all da creepys comes out", my playing time consists of role-playing with people I have never met every time Oxes opens her mouth.  Another example I have is with a player some definitely would call a Non role-player.
<br><br>
Oxes was sitting, again, on the White Bridge in North Karana to heal.  She was near the zone in/out point to South Karana.  In pops this barb that looked absolutely beaut to her in chain.  Beautiful not in the sense of attraction, but in the sense of sheer power and walking death.  Oxes says "Hi ya's! it's good ta see home folk!".  The barb replied "Hello Lassie!".  Oxes' head swam with thoughts of snow and how there never seems to be flea problem with her skins back home.  She told the barb her thoughts and he laughed, agreeing with her.  Later Oxes started hunting with this barb on a regular basis.  I went on vacation to come back to a new sight.  My barb friend now looked like a golden gwad with a horned helm. Many people would stop and remark over him.  To all of these remarks Oxes would say "One day I's gonna grow up in ta a true Bashy Barb!  Jist like him!"  He's become sort of a hero to her.
<br><br>
However, here's why I say some would definitely call him a non role-player.  He does use the dreaded u's.  Personally I shudder at it, but then again I make concessions that not everyone types all day long like I do.  He does mention places that would be "Best for u at this time".  In short without listing them all, he DOES do some things that I know the very hard-core role-player would write him off.  To me however, he is TRYING.  He is doing the best he knows how or perhaps he's never encountered anything more than what he already does.  There's no doubt he knows I would fall into the "heavy" role-player category, and we both adjust to each other accordingly. Examples:
<br><br>
I introduced him to the "Holy One" just recently.  After my introduction he replied "Hello Cousin!"
<br><br>
We have a war about him helping me, or him doing things I think would put him out.  I had to leave the group, we were in the middle of South Karana.  Even though there was no danger to me to find my way back to the bridge, he and I got into a shouting match about him escorting me vs. them just keeping hunting and bashing.  In the end he won by really using /shout "I AM ESCORTING!  I AM STUBBORN AND MY HELM HARDER THAN YOURS!"  which after making this claim, he stuffed his looted raw hide gloved into my mouth and wouldn't remove them until I promised to allow him to help me from there after.
<br><br>
In RiverVale where I introduced him to my "Holy One", he promptly set about buying my barb chain mail pieces I was missing.  Oxes got very angry.  I mean VERY!  She demanded to know if  "Ya's thinky I's a still a barb-cub dat's needed da sled doggies ta even gets round da Everfrost"  [clears throat]  I then did a very stupid, but IC thing.  I challenged him to a duel. HAHAH!  I am sorry, I can't help but laugh. It would have been a slaughter, he was a good 5 levels above me, carrying a combined halberd, and in a horned helm with bronze plate. While I, on the other hand, was in various pieces of patch work with assorted pieces of chain mail, and wielding two Mino Axes.  He starts telling me in /tell he is going to run, I laughing in /say, say that it will most likely be me first but I am going to teach him a scratch of respect.  He then accepts, we stand for a second... and then I swung.  I swung only to be killed by five deputies before I can even get a second kick off with my double swing or respond to his "RUN LASS!!!" when he saw the deputy behind me move in.
<br><br>
I came to, a little away from where I died in the town's center, only to tell my group and him that I was "roflmao".  He won by default and the Holy One presented me with a fish to ease my pain of loosing because a few "lil uns" interfered.  In other words, this non role-player slips more and more into role-playing. Honestly, I don't think he cares about all that.  Role-playing I mean.  I think he wants to be good at the game for one reason.  To help others because he likes helping.  If I have to OOC: I have to feed the dogs you go ahead nothing will hurt me here... he stands and protects me.  He doesn't run on, he doesn't ever stop watch, he's being very IC in reality.  A barb warrior doesn't leave a barb warrior to be slaughtered.  But, he's not DOING THAT for that reason.  It just happens to be IC.  If I zone out, and all of a sudden can't move, he tells me sit then stand.  I can move again!  "Yer so smart!" If it's just us, he'll laugh, if there's a barb or non-barb with us he'll be crest fallen I said so. I'll say "Sorry doll, fergetted we's in company!"
<br><br>
This player I mention, he's the perfect cross example of a power gamer that role-plays with a role-player because of one reason...  It's FUN!
<br><br>
I cannot believe it's just my character that causes all these in-character responses. There have just been to many of them with almost ALL players I encounter.  The only thing I can possibly contribute on my own end is my personal approach to it all.  I try to make it FUN for other people to TALK to Oxes.  For me, she's an incredible comic.  Here's this HUGE personage with war paint on, carrying a massive weapon, screaming "KILL KILL KILL BASH BASH BASH" in a fight one second, the next as blood and guts are still flying, she's sighing fondly remembering how she got "Bittle" eyes for a present when she was a Barb-Cub.
<br><br>
I should say at this point, I am not a 100% pure role-player.  There seems to be this big myth that if you role-play you then must not be able to play or "can't play well".  I do not play Oxes dumb.  I see playing her in character as a challenge that someone who doesn't role-play, but says they "play smart", will never face.  They will use any method regardless of class/race to get an item.  I will use every possible method restricted to my race/class and STILL get that same item. I'll do it for "Good Bashy" or because "Da Holy One gots more Majik's now!". They will do it because now they can kill Super-Nasty-Mean-Gross-Monster-of-Massive-Damage who gives out Nifty-Keen-Armour-of-Gwad-Walking.  Well, so will I.  But while I am doing it, Oxes will probably reminisce about the days when she was a Barb-Cub.
<br><br>
The difference? I think my way creates a small bubble of atmosphere that didn't exist before. Only atmosphere can give that feeling of true conflict, legendary battles and fire-side stories to brag to friends about. We have been given this incredible world to go run around in. It has more props and reasons for clashing race against race than any other MORPG created.  How hard is it to stop, stare, and start chuckling at "Da snotty man in da Pink DRESS!  Looky EVERYONE!".  How is someone going to respond to that?  Unless the person is completely DETERMINED not to make an in character response, they will make one.  Even if they turn around and insult Oxes for being a stupid barb wearing unwashed animal skins.  Well, it's true!  She IS!
<br><br>
I enjoy helping those that want to try role-playing or showing others it REALLY isn't hard. Nor do you have to sacrifice being good at the game to do it. Again, I don't think it's just social Oxes. Though I admit, I did create her with being easy to like vs. difficult.  I did this with the mind that I do like to teach, help, or just interact.  Except, I have a Dark Elf Thief.  She's very twisted, sick, sarcastic, and also doesn't want for role-playing.  Do not ask me, those that are lacking in meeting lots of or any role-players, how it is I have met so many in two opposite roles.  All can say is I talk to people. I talk to lots of people.  Doesn't matter if it's the Oxes "HI ya's!" or the dark elf's rude comment or snide remark downing some other race.  Nine out of ten times, my comments in character directed clearly towards a character get an in character response.
<br><br>
Maybe it's just my perception of people responding to me.  If so, I wish everyone who says they are lacking a role-playing environment could share my perception.
