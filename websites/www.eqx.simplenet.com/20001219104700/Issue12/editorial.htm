<p align="justify">
Well, well, well.  Darned if the beta applications aren't on their way.  Some of our anxiety 
has been relieved!  Now there is the worry about getting accepted to deal with.  :)
<br><br>
I am trying to mentally brace myself for the start of the beta.  You can expect things to start
jumpin' around here once the beta begins.  There will be an interesting dillema for 
us once the beta begins.  We, like many other EQ sites, will be forced to deal with the NDA.  
Now it will be a simple thing for sites that have no affiliation with the beta.  Those folks 
will not have signed any Non-Disclosure Agreement.  So maybe it is best for EQX if I don't 
get into the beta...  Sheesh, that sucks.  Hopefully I will be in the difficult position of 
having to work within the NDA.
<br><br>
This will cause some serious concerns for EQX.  Should we publish things that 
we are pretty sure break the NDA?  Is it our job to police our articles in this regard?  Or 
is that the duty of those that send us the articles, including our own staff?
<br><br>
I ask this here in the hopes that a few web masters out there might send me e-mail 
regarding their stance on this issue.  I would love to know how others plan to handle this.
<br><br>
Thanks for reading.
