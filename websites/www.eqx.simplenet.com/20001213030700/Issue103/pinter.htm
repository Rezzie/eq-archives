Ivar picked up the small, retractable telescope. It quivered in his hand 
slightly as he held it to his eye. "This is almost as ingenious as your 
underwater breathing apparatus, Pinter."
<br><br>
"Aye the greatest friend of a hermit is his mind." Pinter shifted his feet back and forth methodically.
<br><br>
Ivar nodded, "There is the beast," he whispered. "Remember, the calm defeats the 
storm."
<br><br>
"And your pockets defeat your allegiance," he chuckled. "I have your 
finger darts in my pouch. As soon as we bring it down, the reward is..." Ivar 
stopped him in mid sentence with a wave of his finger. They stared into the 
animal's grey hide. Pinter blinked slowly. Ivar began to summon his trusted 
poison tipped dagger, Riend. The sickle shaped blade drew an almost inaudible 
shudder from the nervous gnome. Ivar smiled. Pinter, awakening from his 
trance, drew  two star rubies from his pouch. He handed one to Pinter. They 
cracked them simultaneously, so as to create the least possible disturbance. 
A mystical creature of Earth formed in front of Ivar. A water elemental 
formed almost crashing into a tree. The pets gave a hands up, meaning that 
they were ready to fight. Ivar manuevered his way through the thick 
underbrush. As soon as he could hear the rhino breathing he unsheathed 
Riend, in plain view of the rhino. With a reflex of years of training, Ivar drove his blade into the white part of the eye of the bewildered beast. He twisted it quickly, and only the tip of the horn slashed through his arm. He 
retreated to the shadows. The two elementals raced forward with a surge of 
courage toward the rhino. The roots of the trees began to engulf the rhino's 
feet. Ice pounded down from the water elemental, as the ground shook with a 
tremendous force. Ivar placed his hands in a semi-circle and uttered one soft 
word, "fire". A blazing gust raced forward. Soon after, the elementals found 
themselves beating on a charcoal-like corpse. Adding up the costs of the 
battle, he noted the earth elemental was badly wounded. He put it out of its 
misery swiftly, without pain. He suddenly realized Pinter wasn't there. 
<br><br>
"Pinter, the battles over. Pinter!" He began to search the surronding area 
and eventually came across small footprints looking as though he had taken 
off at a hurried pace. They were still fresh. Further down the trail, he came 
across a deep chasm. On the edge was the telescope. Peering down, he saw 
nothing but dirt and rocks. He raised his arms above his head and quickly 
found himself back in Freeport. He tried not to put a second thought on 
Pinter's fate, but the dreams... they might haunt him.
