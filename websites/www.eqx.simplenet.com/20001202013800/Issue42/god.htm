EQ evolution begins before the open beta begins.
<br><br>
Recently there was notification that the original EQ newsgroup "Forum.Everquest" which was maintained by AVAULT would be shut down.  There was an Eleventh-hour reprieve and the group brought back.  Mind you, everyone who used to frequent it has made a new home elsewhere (More commonly in alt.games.everquest).  An act of God spared the group, but it didn't bring back the teething masses yearning to play.
<br><br>
"Act of God" is an interesting turn of phrase here.  Interesting because a discussion recently erupted in the newsgroup which was about the very subject of God.
<br><br>
The big cheese, the head honcho, etc., etc.
<br><br>
The two primary participants in the discussion used bible passages to reinforce their positions.  While I am not normally interested in such discussions, and indeed I only glanced over it at first, the subject was something worthy of note.
<br><br>
The central question seemed to deal with worship of gods in Norrath.  Essentially, could one play the game and still remain faithful to their own real-life God.  There are many ways to approach this sort of argument, with discussion of worshipping false idols, with the idea that the game itself is a creation of God, or even the Devil, if you like (see D&D circa 1984).
<br><br>
Being a non-Christianity based environ, the developers (989 studios) have decided to base their game around a unique group of gods created to offset each other.  Many games have used pantheons.  It's been a staple of fantasy for many, many decades.
<br><br>
Fantasy games are essentially segments of Earth's own history, given the magic and myth that was believed to be there by the people who lived during that period.  It's Greek warriors fearing the tales of sirens who lure men to their doom.  It's Roman Legionnaires trotting through Europe and sacking everything, but always retaining that fear of Mars and lust for Venus.  Its people believing that the sun is a creation of good forces, put in the sky to warm mankind.  In order to undo the modern world of cellular phones, Lunar Rover and Mars Explorer photos, and instant news by satellite TV, we must take a step back to simpler times and in the absence of science accept what people accept when they have no other explanation of things:  Conjecture and Legend.
<br><br>
Essentially, pantheons of gods are much more meaningful to fantasy environments than monotheistic religious systems because they create a whole bunch of dissimilar motivations for quests.  The will(s) of gods as opposed to the will of God.
<br><br>
There's another reason too, and it's for the political correctness of such environments.  Let's say that developers chose to make God and the Devil the focus of their game.  So then when something happens and a character speaks to God, the developers are put in the unfortunate position of speaking as if they were God.  Now that is bound to create a furor among Christians; a human being role-playing the role of God, speaking as if he were God.
<br><br>
So then what's a Christian to do?  You want to play this great game, but the world is based around "false idols".  How can you do this and remain faithful?
<br><br>
An argument I used in the newsgroup is this:  Let's say you are an actor and you are given the role of a heretic.  Are you betraying God by saying the words the writer gave you?
<br><br>
Essentially, as someone who's done absolutely NO study of religion, I would have to say that you are not.  Reading words doesn't change what's in your heart.  If what you read from the script changed your faith then perhaps there's a problem with your strength of belief.  You either believe and worship, or you don't.
<br><br>
When one plays Grimnal, the dark elf cleric, he worships a god dissimilar to the one we all are familiar with.  Does this mean that by merely saying things like "Innoruuk curse you!" you are indeed saying something against Christ?  Role-playing is a process during which you take on the personae of a fictional character.  Fiction.
<br><br>
Playing a character worshipping a god is not nearly the same as yourself worshipping God. And this is where this argument always gets bogged down.  If I say "Innoruuk curse you!" am I indeed worshipping a false god?  Do I honestly and truly, sitting here in front of my computer, someday playing EverQuest, worship Innoruuk?
<br><br>
It would be different if you truly believed that Innoruuk were a god.  That's when you should be afraid for yourself.  Not because you have angered the God you have followed all this time, but because you've slipped out of reality and started believing the game.
