I'm not sure it can be done.  I just do not think that my roleplaying needs can be met by EverQuest or any other multiplayer online game.  There is no way that a game like this can do what I need it to.
<br><br>
Consider this scene from our D&D game this Saturday.  We are offered the key to removing the curse from the only 'monster' owned keep in the land.  If we can free the keep from its curse we will become famous, wealthy, and our tribes will have a place from which to battle the Elves and Humans that are encroaching on our hunting grounds (the bastards!  :P)  But to earn this information we have to retrieve a skeleton key from the grave of a human merchant.  This merchant is burred only a few miles from the largest Human settlement in our known world.  And we have to pass through probably one hundred miles of Human and Elven territory to get there.  A daunting task, but certainly one that a computer game could have sent us on as well.
<br><br>
And the trip was torturous.  A seven or eight day journey is primarily a challenge to us monsters because we have trouble preserving food.  So we can carry enough for about five days.  More than that is too bulky, and likely to spoil anyway.  So many of us are hungry the whole time.  Grendel, my bird man bard, is heard to say, "If you all weren't slowing me down so much…" so many times that the others are prepared to kill him.  Not that they aren't anyway.  Add to the food shortage the fear of Elves (they scare the piss outta us), the fact that we are travelling along a Human infested river, the local beasts (as opposed to monster, 'cause monsters can think and talk!), and the fact that a lot of us hate each other, and you have an eventful journey.  Again, still something that a computer game could offer.
<br><br>
We arrive at the cemetery and find the huge mausoleum of the dead merchant.  We enter to find ourselves faced with a ghost.  She appears to us much like the ones from Raiders of the Lost Ark, you know; "It's so beautiful!"  Well, most of us run away.  After many attempts and much shame at all the running away, we manage to engage the thing in battle and defeat it!  We entered the mausoleum and found, after much trekking and terror (poor Grendel is claustrophobic, and the Goblin is terribly superstitious) we find the ghost of the merchant and his two bony guards.  It was a very close fight, but we defeated them all and retrieved the skeletal key.  As we pulled it from the dusty remains on the cold stone floor, the tomb began to shake and we heard the sound of many coffin lids being tossed aside.  We ran like the cowardly monsters we are.  We barely made it out before all the souls in the merchant's family mausoleum could arise and teach us the penalty for robbing the dead.  Again, a computer game could give us that as well.
<br><br>
When we finally saw the sun, err… moon, again we were relieved.  But we had to pause in our back-patting party.  Outside waiting for us were eleven Goblins.  Usually not a problem for us.  But one of us was carried out, and two others were limping.  And the goblins had archers.  We recognized their leader as the one that was attempting to lead the Goblin tribe back into power amongst the other tribes.  He had recently challenged our Minotaur to a duel and won.  A bad scene.  We decided that there was no way we were going to give up, though, and decided to try to take them out.  Grendel was going to flee with the key.  But we never got a chance.  The fast acting leader of the Goblins, the mighty Kozak, disabled three of us with a cloud of stench so vile that we, including Grendel, were unable to move.  The other two were forced to surrender.  And so the Goblins made off with our key!  The one that we fought so hard and long to get.  The one that would make each of us kings of our own little worlds!  Well, I suppose that a computer game could do that too, with a GM playing Kozak and perhaps others as the host of Goblins.
<br><br>
But we did not let them go.  Grendel decided to follow them.  He could fly out of range of their small bows and at least discover where they would camp for the day.  Goblins hate to travel in the sun.  So he followed them.  At dawn they killed a farm family and took up residence for the day in their home.  Grendel went back to his allies and told them.  There was no way that they were going to be able to defeat the Goblins, but the Humans could.  We might lose the key, but at least the Goblins would die.  So Grendel, who can actually write the Human language, wrote three crude notes that said that Goblins had killed Human farmers and with a crude map to their location.  He then dropped them onto Humans, two on farmers nearby and one on some patrolling guards.  He then went to the farm and hid on the roof to see what happened.
<br><br>
Shortly six Humans in armor arrived.  Grendel hoped that they would be strong enough to just barely defeat Kozak and his riders, and that Grendel could swoop in and steal the key back after the dust settled.  Well, it turns out that Humans are stupid.  While four of them circled the house on their horses, two approached the door.  Stupid.  Goblins attack in mobs, two humans would fall fast.  But even I didn't think that Kozak would use his Shaman spells on them.  The two collapsed instantly.  Two other humans (still being stupid as they are), rode up to see what had happened.  It was then that I discovered that Kozak is much more powerful than we had suspected.  A great ball of fire erupted, engulfing the two Humans that approached as well as the two that were already collapsed at the door.  The remaining two Humans, finally showing some brains, rode away.  The Goblins also packed up and moved out.  Grendel followed, stopping to leave a note telling the Humans which way they went, and stopping every hour or so to tear a big arrow in the grass, pointing toward the Goblins.  That's where we ended.
<br><br>
I just can't see how a computer game can allow for anywhere near that much interaction with the environment.  It can't possibly account for that kind of free flowing action.  It just can't absorb creative input like that.  I know for a fact that our GM never intended for us to try to turn the Humans against the Goblins.  But he could adapt to that idea on the fly and make the game a blast because of it.  No computer game, even with in-game GMs, could do that.  It's just not going to be a real roleplaying game for me.
<br><br>
So I need to decide if it can be enough of a roleplaying game for me.  Folks that know me on the net know that I do not spend my time in IRC and I never turn on ICQ.  I am nearly impossible to find on line in a 'chat' atmosphere.  It's not really my thing.  I don't really do small talk.  I get distracted and bored pretty easily.  I can talk all day on a topic that interests me.  But I can't do chatter.  And that's a lot of what folks see as roleplaying in an online game.  I don't.  I need more.  I need to be in character and directly involved in the things that happen around me.  I hate the idea of trying to talk to a computer run NPC looking for the key word that will finally get him to tell me what I need to know.
<br><br>
"Hello, can you sell me a boat?"<br>
"Hello, can I purcase a boat from you?"<br>
Crap…<br>
"Hello, can I purchase a boat from you?"
<br><br>
You know what I mean.  Especially in a world where conversation is severely limited by our ability to type.  I have no idea what my typing speed is, but it's not as good as my speaking speed.  And one of the things that makes roleplaying fun for me is the banter.  By the time I've typed up my witty but long winded reply, the topic has turned to something else.  And that stupid merchant that doesn't know that I mean 'purchase' not 'purcase' just pisses me off.
<br><br>
Not only will I not have the unlimited options from my pen and paper games, but I won't even be able to engage in the same level of witty conversation.  So will I be able to enjoy EverQuest with all these limitations?  I hope so.  There will be some compensation for my loss.  I'll get to play with people that I never get to play with, folks from all over the place.  I can play any time I want.  I'll get to explore a world created by different GMs than I am used to.  And I'll get to play with some really hi-tech software.
<br><br>
I'm as hyped about EverQuest as any two of you reading this.  But I can't go into it without considering what I want out of it, and what I will get.  I suggest that you all do the same.  This will allow us to avoid disappointment (think of the last movie you went to that everyone told you was great that turned out to be a huge disappointment because of it).  It will also allow us to enjoy what we <u>are</u> getting in EverQuest.
