The party had penetrated two levels of caverns before they ran across the Gnolls.  It
had first been a couple of sentries, then a room full of drunken Gnoll warriors, and
finally had culminated in a pitched battle in a large cavern which had looked to be a
training ground.  During the battle, Arthedain had been separated from his
companions, and had to flee for his life.  Unable to find a way up towards the
surface, he had gotten lost trying to find some way to leave this hell-hole which may
very well soon be his tomb.

Rounding the corner, he came to a huge cavern with tattered hanging banners and a
bridge over a small stream.  As he entered, he decided to pause for breath and check
behind him.  Panting, he rested against the wall and looked down the corridor he had
just came from.  As his breathing slowed, Arthedain was able to listen and hear the
barking growls the Gnolls made as they searched for him.  It seemed like they were
getting farther away, the baying call of the hunt receded as if they had taken
another way, perhaps even lost the track.

Looking across the cavern, he saw a pair of blue posts which looked like a gate of
some sort.  The same sort of posts were part of the bridge which went over the
stream.  Perhaps the "gate" was some sort of exit of significance, maybe leading to
stairs or a corridor which led up.  Arthedain jogged over the bridge towards the
gate.
