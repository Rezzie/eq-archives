Greetings! 
<br><br>
I am known as Faylina, aspiring Bard of Kelethin; and this is my tale. 
 <br><br>
Many months ago while supping with my father, a messenger arrived at our tree-hut.  He gave news that one Sta'vius had requested my presence in the gnomish city of Ak'Anon.  It seems that Sta'vius' father and my adventuring mother had traveled together many years before and the slight tinkerer desired our families remain close.  I personally had never been far beyond our own tree village, much less leagues to south beyond the mountains, and suddenly I found in me the awakened wanderlust of my mother.  Pleading with my father I begged to be allowed to make the journey.  Seeing the glint in my eyes, he knew there was no denying my passion. 
<br><br>
"My daughter Faylina," he said, "your lilting voice will carry in my ears while you travel.  But I will not have you travel unprepared.  There are many dangers and hazards unknown to us in the lands beyond the Feydark.  Take your mother's sword and gather with the initiates on the forest floor.  Learn from them and from me the skills you will need to make your trek."
<br><br>
My blood coursing, I belted the ancient weapon at my side and scurried to the nearest elevator.  On the forest floor I found many young elves hunting the bats, rats, and spiders that constantly breed in the Feydark.  I gleefully joined them and traded the carcasses in for pennies.  The guards who oversaw us and protected us from the orc raids gave a sense of security to the area and, in spite of the occasional poisoning from spider bites; I suffered little more than scratches and bruises.  My father always said I learned quickly, and after a month the guards proclaimed me ready to tackle the black wolves that graced our forestlands.
<br><br>
Finally, one day, my father approached me after supper; holding in his arms a worn book.  
<br><br>
"Faylina, I have saved the coppers you have earned and bought for you your own score book.  I have written for you a song in it's first pages; an ancient hymn of battle that empowers the muscles, and strengthens the heart.  Learn it well, and fare thee well on your journey."
<br><br>
I hugged my father's neck, barely holding back the tears.  On the morn, I set out for the Steamfont Mountains.  My father could not tell me the way, only that he knew it lay south of the Feydark.  I purchased rations for the journey and followed the southerly path from my home.  Before long the distant sounds of the forest filled my ears, and murky green that was daylight began to fade.
<br><br>
Ahead of me the path lay dark, lit only by the occasional pixie who curiously followed or teased my long hair.  A saw other travelers, jogging at a steady pace toward Kelethin with little more than a hello.  I walked over a rise and was faced with the biggest quandary of my short adventure.  The path forked.  From the left there was soft glow in the distance.  To the right lay the cold night mist of the forest.  
<br><br>
Turning left I cried out in fright and stopped still.  Before me was a spider, huge and menacing, it's mandibles leaking fluid.  I stared into its myriad pattern of eyes and wondered at my fate.  With a squeal and a hiss, the spider turned away from me!  A sharp cut had been gouged into its body and green ichor leaked to the ground.  On the far side of the spider was an elf, but like no elf I had ever seen!  Tall and beautiful, pale and terrible, he was.  His blonde locks swayed in the air as he chopped at the great beast before him.  Before long, it was nothing more than guts and goo seeping into the ground.  I hailed him and thanked him for saving me.  He looked long in my direction, then turned and wordlessly ran off into the night.  I followed him as best as I could, down the path and towards the warm glow, but to no avail.  My savior was gone into the dark.
<br><br>
I continued down the path a short ways and in the distance appeared to burn torches.  Hurrying forward a grand structure appeared before me.  I knew it at once from my mother's stories: Felwithe!  Home of high elves!  I wondered at the great walls before me, and the noble creatures that milled around the entrance.  I was enthralled, fascinated at my first glimpse of another race.  
<br><br>
I have never been shy; my bardic father would never have allowed it, so I approached many of the pale and beautiful elves.  It was then that I learned my first lesson of the wilderness, for though they appeared beautiful, they were also haughty and arrogant.  None would speak to me but one.  He was sitting on the ground in front of the gate, nursing a gash in his arm.  His hair was the same color as mine and he seemed to be pleased to have a companion while he tended his wound.  We talked shortly and I asked him the way to Ak'Anon.  Alas he did not know, only that it was south.  I thanked him, and sat with him until the morning sun broke through the forest mist.
<br><br>
I ate a biscuit and quenched my thirst from my flagon.  Brushing off my tunic of leaves I turned to say farewell to the noble, but he was gone, returning to the Felwithe gates.  I waved and set off on my own journey.
<br><br>
My experience with the great spider had taught me a lesson and I tuned my eyes to quickly spot their orange and brown bodies that I might avoid them.  But another challenge lie before me, as the path began to twist and turn until my sense of direction was totally confounded.  Other creatures I saw as well, wolves and forest creatures, eerily clattering skeletons, ill at ease with their own deaths and seeking others on which to prey.
<br><br>
The path forked again, and I took the right pass, dusk was coming and I would need to decide whether to rest, or push on.  I circled a giant tree, and my decision was suddenly easier.  Before me were two tents with a fire being started between them.  The creature starting the fire grunted, his armor creaking in the silent air.  I stopped suddenly, and it looked up, the fangs exposed in a snarl.  Orc!
<br><br>
The orc charged me; it's claws glistening in the mist.  I turned to run, but it was too late, I fell, the fangs driving into my back!  I ripped my sword from its sheath as I rolled out from under the vile creature and the battle chant my father taught me sprang to my lips.  I slashed at the thing, my blows striking harder than they ever had before, and it cried out in agony.  The fire left it's black eyes and turned to escape my steel, but my song had enabled me with courage and with one final stroke I plunged the blade into its black heart.  As the death rattled in its throat I heard another distant roar.  There were more orcs in the distance!  I quickly ran off down the path, leaving a trail of my own blood behind.  I knew they would follow.
<br><br>
Blinded in my pain and fear I stumbled along the path until by some miracle, I happened upon a great mountain pass, the lush vegetation growing on the sides of the mountain were little comfort with the sounds of orc howls at my heels.  To my fortune, there was camp made at base of the pass.  Squat and fat they were with long hair growing from the bottoms of their heads.  Dwarves!  At my approach, they stood, and almost as one, drew huge axes and hefted them to ready.  My momentum carried me towards them, and I expected my own death.  As I neared them, I heard the axe-blades whistling through the air.  I stumbled and fell, turning to face my danger.  A cry of agony reached my ears and my eyes witnessed the dual axes bury into the orc warrior.  It quivered in spasms of death, soaking the two fighters with spurts of black blood.  I fell to the ground, sweating and bleeding.
<br><br>
As the two withdrew their axes and looted the foul body, another of their kind approached me.  His voice was gruff, but soothing and he asked me what my condition was.  Still panting and out of breath I was unable to answer.  He firmly placed his paw on my shoulder and examined my wound.  His dark eyes were kind as he muttered words of a strange tongue and waved signs over my cuts.  One by one, they healed, and I felt strength return to my body.  I thanked them all for saving me.
<br><br>
"You were lucky!" one of the fighters growled at me.  "There was only one.  Normally there are more and you would have endangered all our lives.  Next time, shout a warning before you lead rampaging orcs through someone's camp!"
<br><br>
"I'mm sorry," I stammered, "I was surprised by them.  I managed to kill one before the other gave chase."
<br><br>
He seemed shocked, "You!  Killing orcs?  Ha!"   He began muttering under his breath, "Elf maidens killing orcs; that'll be the day."  His speech was rough, but I felt beneath it a touch of kindness and smiled.  
<br><br>
I camped with them that night, regaining the rest of my strength, and queried as the whereabouts of Ak'Anon.
<br><br>
"Through this pass.  Follow the path to the outpost, then right into Steamfont.  Good journey, slayer.  Harumph!"
<br><br>
I thanked them again, and started off on my journey.
<br><br>
On the other side of the mountains the mist had lightened, and the sun shone through the trees in some areas.
<br><br>
"Lesser Feydark!" I exclaimed aloud.
<br><br>
I easily found the path and began a comfortable pace down.  For almost a day I traveled, stopping for lunch near a fork in the road.  I saw no other travelers that day, and eventually found a series of small huts on the horizon.  Without my noticing, the mountains had risen on my right, and these huts appeared to be at their very foot.
<br><br>
As I neared the shacks I was startled to see an explosion of strange light, accompanied by the most unnatural sounds!  I quickened my pace and rounded the bend to see two dwarven guards battling some horrid creature!  Another short creature with wispy hair of white was growing fire from his hands!  With a gesture he threw it at the monster and it exploded in flame!  I was so flabbergasted all I could do was watch as the creature's skin boiled under the magician's touch, and its flesh was hacked by the dwarves until it was dead.
<br><br>
With the corpse still smoking, the magician turned to look at me.  The guards returned silently to their posts.
<br><br>
"You must be a gnome!" I exclaimed.
<br><br>
"Aye!" he replied.
<br><br>
I waited, uncomfortable, for a moment.
<br><br>
"Is this the path to Ak'Anon?" I asked.
<br><br>
He looked around a second, "Which path?"
<br><br>
I pointed and he turned to look.
<br><br>
"Aye, I believe it is."
<br><br>
I found it strange that a gnome would not know where his own city was!  But I resolved that they must be a funny folk, as my father had often told me, and resumed my pace down the path.
<br><br>
Almost immediately I ran into the pass through the mountains.  The trees gave way to open blue skies and lush green hills.  My breath left me!  The hills were alive, belching great bouts of steam and smoke into the air!
<br><br>
"Steamfont!" I said to myself.
<br><br>
I quickly followed the path and soon came to a funny little guard dressed all in plate mail.  He stood at the fork of the road.  I addressed him, and was shown the path to Ak'Anon.  Around a bend and in the distance I could see two great green torches burning in the side of hill.  My destination was at hand!
<br><br>
I neared the gates and called out for my contact.
<br><br>
"Sta'vius! Sta'vius!  Faylina has arrived!"
<br><br>
I heard a shout and turned to see a gnome, standing on the hill above the gates waving to me.  He gaily hopped down and approached, a smile creasing his leathery face.
<br><br>
Our hands were clasped in a gesture of friendship when we heard the cry.  Screams echoed in the distance.  A gnome fleeted past us and shouted a word I had only heard in legend.
<br><br>
"Minotaur!"
<br><br>
Sta'vius' eyes grew wide and he turned to look out across the hills.
<br><br>
Without warning, the minotaur was upon us and the giant axe crashed into his skull, showering me with his blood.  I looked up and saw the giant beast turn to glare at me!  His horns were covered in gore; his muzzle snorted steam into the air.  Murderous rage burned behind his black and evil eyes.
<br><br>
The axe fell again.
<br><br>
I see my mother now, long dead, playing her harp, high above in the misty trees of the Greater Feydark; singing a lullaby.
