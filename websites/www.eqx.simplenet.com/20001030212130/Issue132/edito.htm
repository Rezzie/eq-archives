  I was reading the boards this week and came across <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059489.html">this 
  comment</a>, and it got me to thinking&#133;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#0000CC">i 
  know you can cite the number of accounts verant currently has. but what are 
  you going to do when EQ finally has competition? you do realize how many customers 
  you are going to lose dont you? is the company policy &quot;rake it in while 
  we can&quot;? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>How many are 
  we going to lose? That's hard to say. We all know that EQ has a finite life. 
  Newer games will come along that will grab peoples attention, just like we've 
  grabbed the attention of the current players. This is how the gaming industry 
  works. You grab their attention and keep it as long as you can.</i></font></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don't think 
  that this qualifies as a &quot;rake it in while we can&quot; policy, at least 
  not in a negative sense. We provide a service offering and people decide whether 
  or not they want to be our subscribers. This service offering is flexible, but 
  only to the point that it remains the same offering. Given infinite resources, 
  sure, we have tons of things that we could do for EQ, but will only do those 
  things that make the game &quot;EQ&quot;. We won't risk completely changing 
  gameplay to the point that we'd lose the magic that is responsible for EQ's 
  success.</font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But as for us 
  not having &quot;competition&quot;, we currently enjoy about half of the marketshare 
  among those playing the 3 MMORPGs out there. That's fairly indicative of some 
  current competition. If you recall, EQ was supposed to &quot;Kill&quot; the 
  top MMORPG of the time (UO), and was supposed to be &quot;Killed&quot; by the 
  next (AC). Neither of those things happened, as we all continue to co-exist 
  peacefully. We each provide a niche that a varying and increasing number of 
  subscribers enjoy.</font></i></p>

  Having been around the EQ community for about three years, I&#146;ve often wondered 
  about the life-span of the game. When the Team PvP servers were opened, first 
  as one then as multiple servers, I was curious as to how long the servers would 
  have a population spike and then settle down even to the point of extinction. 
  Now, having been on a server that split (Karana) due to overcrowding, and watching 
  servers be split and added - well, I thought I&#146;d do some looking ahead 
  from behind. (Yes, I really just said that.) I&#146;m wondering about the life 
  of EQ - I&#146;m wondering what comes next. What could Verant improve as the 
  market&#146;s attention span shifts elsewhere, to re-attract the player-base 
  they are currently enjoying?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I&#146;ve been 
  involved in MUDs since about 1988. As MUD programming evolved, MUDs would either 
  stay running the same code or try to move into better gameplay by upgrading 
  or changing to another code. Many MUD creators heavily modified existing code 
  to bring their mud more in line with their Vision&#153; of what they wanted 
  in a role-playing experience. <a href="http://www.mudconnector.com/">The MUDconnector</a> 
  currently lists 1670 MUDs, a faintly accurate peek at how many MORPG Vision&#153;&#146;s 
  there are out there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Games where many 
  people share a reality are typically challenged by several issues. Player interaction, 
  gameplay (including graphics), game balance, in-game rewards, and setting/storyline/immersion 
  all interact to make a game enjoyable or not to each individual player. How 
  a game addresses these issues helps determine the player base, the level of 
  enjoyment, and the duration of the game on the market. Currently, EQ enjoys 
  the largest market share in this field because, overall, it does the majority 
  of these things better than the other current games on the market. In some areas 
  EQ could be better, and it&#146;s these areas I&#146;m going to focus on. I&#146;m 
  sure my Vision&#153; may be different than many, but bear with me. I won&#146;t 
  cover everything in this editorial, but I&#146;ll start with camping, one of 
  the downsides of EQ play. Camping is an important issue because it causes some 
  of the worst player behaviors in the game - kill-stealing, the &#147;owning&#148; 
  of a spawn or even a whole zone, and numerous violations of the &#147;Play nice&#148; 
  policy, which wouldn&#146;t exist if camping wasn&#146;t an issue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think EQ developers 
  were surprised at how many players decided to play by camping. Many of the Game 
  developers were MUDders, and many played PnP RPGs, so they came from an &#147;adventuring&#148; 
  background. In the interaction between fun, experience awards, and item rewards, 
  Verant unintentionally tipped the scales towards experience and item rewards, 
  and made it easier by having static spawns. MUD&#146;s had nothing but static 
  spawns - if you knew a room that had good loot you&#146;d always see players 
  there, but when translated into a rich graphics environment I think it was hoped 
  that players would move about more. With Kunark they moved the items around 
  a lot more, making for less static camping, but it&#146;s still an issue. If 
  I asked: &#147;You will have a great time, risk death frequently and get 3.9 
  bubbles of experience and a minor magic item, or you can sit in one spot and 
  get 4 bubbles of experience and one or two minor magic items, take your pick&#148;, 
  I think that most EQ players would go for the 4 bubs experience. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recent post on 
  the Stratics Westwood Tavern illustrated this. The poster had looked back at 
  some of the polls run on Allakhazam&#146;s http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ 
  site, and discovered this fact:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the poll that 
  asked the question &quot;What will you do when Kunark comes out?&quot;, the 
  most popular answer was:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Head to the current 
  popular zones hoping the crowds are gone 2686 30%</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So this month's 
  question is &quot;How much time do you spend in Kunark?&quot; The top two answers 
  are:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I rarely go to 
  Kunark 1964 33% <br>
  I spend some time in Kunark, but mostly play elsewhere 999 17% </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interestingly enough, 
  this contrasts with an earlier poll, which asks:<br>
  Typically speaking, what type of player are you? <br>
  (1) 33.8% Explorer; <br>
  (2) 22.7% Role Player; <br>
  (3) 22.6% Power Leveler; <br>
  (4) 14.1% Chat/Socializer; <br>
  (5) 4.7% Newbie; <br>
  (6) 1.8% Kill Stealer (be honest). <br>
  Total Votes: 12375</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What it comes down 
  to is this: never underestimate the desire for players to take the easy route 
  to success. With a whole new area to explore, new items, decent experience, 
  etc most folks want to go where they have already been, despite that most people 
  consider themselves explorers. (Yes, I know these polls are not necessarily 
  accurate, but it&#146;s better than guessing.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The idea that an 
  item is &#147;necessary&#148; is another odd fixation with players. Pure casters 
  <b>require</b> a Flowing Black Robe, or warriors <b>must</b> have a Polished 
  Granite Tomahawk (with the corollary being &#147;if you don&#146;t have these 
  items you might as well not play&#148;). If an item is viewed as essential you 
  can dilute the issue by having many similar items spread out more, which is 
  what Verant did with Kunark. It doesn&#146;t completely fix this issue, because, 
  on occasion there are (and should be) very rare, highly useful items which add 
  to a player&#146;s status, allowing all to marvel at his/her prowess in acquiring 
  such a cool item. Quest items are another issue, too, but I&#146;ll deal with 
  that in a quest editorial.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What if a desired 
  item was actually carried by several spawns in an area? To use an example: The 
  Goblin King&#146;s crown could be on the Goblin King, the Goblin king's page, 
  his wife, his Champion, or the goblin crown polisher. Each may have it at varying 
  moments during the goblin day or night. Each area would have modifiable story 
  line, and the item would never be static. A rogue could, conceivably, enter 
  and steal the crown for the page at the right moment, winning the item camp 
  lottery. A warrior may pop in and best the Goblin King&#146;s Champion, winning 
  the item in a glorious battle. The key is to make it part of a storyline, not 
  too predictable, even allowing for hints to be given out by other NPC&#146;s 
  elsewhere. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goblin King: Page, 
  take my crown to the crown polisher.<br>
  Page: Yes, my Lord King.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Page: The King 
  wants his crown polished!<br>
  Crown polisher: Aye, send for it in two hours.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mistress: Oooh 
  Mr. Crown polisher, how does it look on me? I&#146;m going to go look in my 
  mirror!<br>
  Crown polisher: (mutters) Ok, but bring it right back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Crown polisher: 
  (screams) where is it? I need it back!<br>
  Mistress: Ooopsie! (giggle) I must have left it on the queen&#146;s bedspread</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goblin Queen: What 
  the? What&#146;s this doing here?<br>
  Goblin&#146;s Champion: (rolling over) Yeah, ow! It stabbed me in the backside.<br>
  Goblin Queen: Put on your pants and give it to the page outside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Champion: Uh, give 
  this to the King<br>
  Page: Yes sir!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Page: here you 
  are, Lord King!<br>
  Goblin King: (wonders to himself) How come I smell goblin backside? I took a 
  bath last month! (sniffs)<br>
  Goblin King: Page, take my crown to the crown polisher.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Etc, etc. (Let 
  me apologize for this brief look inside the court of the Goblin King. It&#146;s 
  not pretty.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AI in EverQuest 
  could even address monster behavior when groups were in the area - Would you 
  sit quietly on your throne if a party of 50+ players were sitting around waiting 
  for you to show up? I&#146;ll bet the Goblin King would at least beef up his 
  guards. I think a Goblin King raid would be much more exciting if you rushed 
  into his lair, reached the king, and slew him as more guards appeared to force 
  you to retreat away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When EQ was first 
  being planned, the average bandwidth was 14.4, the average texture memory was 
  2M, and the processor speed was around (slightly less than) 200Mhz. What they 
  could do graphics and game/combat mechanics-wise was limited not necessarily 
  by the Vision&#153; but also by the constraints put on them by hardware. It 
  is part of the reason why there aren&#146;t more character faces, and may well 
  be why static spawns were necessary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This brings me 
  to my point: From the quote above, Abashi shows that Verant is aware of the 
  birth and death cycle of MMORPGs. If you had the most popular MMORPG out there, 
  and you knew it would die out eventually, what would you do? If I were Verant, 
  I&#146;d take all the lessons learned from EQ, and put them into making a new 
  EQ, with the increased flexibility allowed by high bandwidths, faster graphics 
  cards with more Texture memory, higher processor speed. I&#146;d also make expansions 
  (Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious) to push the envelope a little bit more, 
  and to test some emerging technologies. This editorial is one of the possible 
  solutions to the EverCamp phenomenon - it might not be possible to fix EQ this 
  way, but EQ- the Next Generation?</font></p>
