<em>Dear Expressions,
<br><br>
I recently married, in a mud ceremony online, and got married to a woman I had met last year online.  We really hit it off from the start, and have been together since.  My problem is I feel guilty as hell because in real life I'm married!  What should I do?
<br><br>

<br><br>
You know having played Mud's over the years, I have witnessed this many times.  If you're human at all you can't help but fall in love online.  Not just love the way a husband loves a wife, but love and respect for your friends.  Some of my best friends have been cyber friends online.  I've trusted those friends with information I would never have had the courage to tell someone in real life.  I have found that just about any emotion you experience in real life can also be experienced online.
<br><br>
Let's say you're new to a MUD, and you just logged in for the first time.  You might not be too familiar with the commands so the first command you figure out is /say.  This gives you the ability to communicate with those that are near you, so you begin to ask questions.
<br><br>
"<em>How do I do this, and how do I do that</em>." You say.
<br><br>
Usually (but not always) it's someone of the opposite sex that notices, and takes interest in you, and helps you with basic commands on the MUD.  This person might also take you to a donation room.  In a mud this is a place where equipment is spawned or is there because players donated it from distant dungeons by typing /donate item.  So you get some basic armament to keep you alive while you're on the hunt (killing those vicious cats and dogs around the city).
<br><br>
Now you have just had your first encounter with someone else online.  From now on when you log on to the game you might look for this person.  Maybe greet them, telling them thanks for the help.  One day this new friend you have acquired sees you smashing mean kitty cats in town.  He/she asks you if you want to gain a few levels.  Of course you can't refuse their offer so you follow them.  They whirl you off to some far off place, where you have no clue how to get back from.  Basically you trust them with your life.
<br><br>
Once you arrive at the hunting spot, he/she sits you down and instructs you to wait there.  After a short time they return with a creature beating on them, but not really doing any damage.  He/she weakens the creature until it's about ready to die from fatal wounds.  They order you to kill the creature, as they switch to a weapon that obviously is dong no damage.  You wack at the creature for what seems like an hour, hitting the creature about one in twenty swings, until it finally dies.  You see the message "<em>You gained 100,000 experience points</em>."  You cheer with glee because you have just gained three levels with one kill.  This was incredible since the last three days, in town, have brought you only one level.
<br><br>
After a few hours of this you have gained over fifteen levels, and you are filled with joy because you no longer look like a newbie on the mud.  But you have gained more than just levels.  While sitting between kills, waiting for your tank (someone who takes all the damage from a creature) to heal, through conversation, have learned a lot about this person.  You talked about everything under the sun.  You hug your friend.
<br><br>
After a few weeks of traveling with this person, you find yourself logging on the mud just to check to see if your friend is there.  If you don't find them, you usually just log off.   Even others on the MUD take notice when you are not together, and often ask you where the other is.  The whole MUD knows you two are a couple.  After months of playing with this person online, knowing much about the person's personality, both online and possibly offline, he/she asks you to marry them.   Having seen others wed online it didn't really seem like that silly idea, so you accept the proposal, and the two of you are married.
<br><br>
The God's online scribe items in the spirit of the marriage.  Wedding rings and other named items are created for the bride and groom to exchange with their vows.  On the day of the wedding, most of the dedicated roleplayers show up to witness the ritual, and eat cake and drink ale.  At the days end everyone is happy, drunk, and filled with joy in your solemnization.  From then on the whole mud knows you two as husband and wife.  
<br><br>
My two closest friends were husband and wife online, and decided to marry in real life.  I wasn't there to witness their online wedding, but I was the best man at the wedding in real life.  The love they shared online was very REAL to them, and actually, I think when asked how long they have been married, they add the total real life years to years married online.
<br><br>
I guess the answer to your question is this.  How real does your life online seem to you?
