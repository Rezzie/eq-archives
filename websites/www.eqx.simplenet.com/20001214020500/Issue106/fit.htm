Hoi there... Lrets D'pearl here back from me short hiatus .. whew! I hope the bright shiny things that I used to distract me long lost twin Ogre brother... errr actually I mean brudda... kept ye occupied while I was away :) In any case... I don't have so much a scoop as it may be a question for all ye devoted readers ... 
 <br><br>
Now I must say... in me travels across the lands of Norrath I've come across some VERY interesting things... many of which I have shared with ye... but I've noticed a disturbing trend of stange couplings taking place lately... For instance, here I am minding me own business, trundling through Beholder Gorge... when Lo and Behold I come across.... blech! Well take a look at the picture... Oh!!!! Gah!!!! Before ye go on... a warning to all ye parents out there... the rest of this article may contain subject matter of a... errr... um &lt;blush&gt;... errrr... delicate matter... Please use ye'r discretion before letting the young'ns read on :) Blech! I came across a muddite minotaur!!! Now WHAT in the blazes could motivate these creatures to do something like that?!?!?! I think we need more hunters in this area... those creatures have FAR too much time on their hands to come up with something like this!

Yeesh! I dunno WHAT'S going on in the Gorge but these Mino's and Muddites have FAR too much time on their hands... how does such a thing come into existence I ask! C'mon ye adventurers let's get out there and give these creatures something to do besides... uh... errrr... well the picture can explain.
 <br><br>
To make matters worse ... here I am taking me lil cousin for a walk in the grassy area around East Freeport and Northern Ro... when we stumble across this!!!!

<em>Now how in the blazes do I explain this when me lil cousin asks me what are those fire beetles doin' Unca Lrets?</em>
</center><p style="text-align: justify">

Gah!!! All I know is that I've just GOT to send a wake up call to ye adventurers out there... to get up off ye'r arses and do some killin'! I know all ye'v got ye'r PGT's and BBC's and BLT'S and ASAP's and whatever the heck it is all ye power hungry 246 levelers out there got :) ... but yeesh! There's no excuse for letting these kinds of images play out in front of our impressionable youth.

This is Lrets D'pearl Aspiring Bard Extraordinaire and Cub Reporter who will gladly take suggestions as to what to tell his lil cousin what the beetles were doin' off to go hunt down those pervo muddites and Minotaurs... oh! And someone go tell those Fire Beetles to go rent a room!
