When you hear most people speak of EQ it pretty much boils down to game play and graphics. Most forget why UO was such a terrible game to participate in. The community or the lack thereof. Sure great graphics and game play are needed, but if everyone playing is rude and impertinent, the fun quickly fades.
<br><br>
A game of this size is going to incorporate thousands of people, all of varying backgrounds and demeanors. This is going to cause conflicts here and there. No way of getting around it. Even if you try hard to maintain a peaceful disposition at all times, there are some people out there that will ruffle your feathers.
<br><br>
So what can keep EQ from falling to the same demise as UO? If the problem is focused around the people, and their inability to cooperate how do we remedy it? Brad has mentioned such features as /ignore and such, but how do you ignore someone running around you in circles? Or even better, trying to get you killed by blocking you in an area, or dropping off beasts that you can't handle right in front of you. These are things that can't be stopped.
<br><br>
EQ customer support is supposed to be wonderful, and I am sure they will not allow these things, but that does not mean people won't try to make them happen. What can a peaceful individual that just wants a good gaming experience for them and the people surrounding them do to help? This is a question that has yet to be answered.
<br><br>
No matter how hard an individual tries, he cannot move the world by himself. This goes back to "community" again. It will take MANY individuals working together to keep a safe environment for all. We, as dedicated gamers and role-players, need to work together to stop this. We cannot run and hide at the first sign of people abusing the system to hurt others, or even just to annoy them. You would be amazed at how many people there are out there that get their kicks off of others displeasure.
<br><br>
I have had the pleasure of meeting with some of the finest people planning on making a life in Norrath, and hopefully we can all be on the same server. That may or may not be a dream, but if we were to accomplish it, imagine the possibilities. A server filled with like-minded individuals. Who cares if they want to be a Troll Shadow Knight, because you know if you run into them in game, they will be role-playing. My Half-Elf Paladin would have to duel him, screaming battle cries to Erollisi the whole time. Afterwards, we may speak out of character saying how wonderful that was.
<br><br>
Now, not every Troll ShadowKnight you run into on a server full of people of different mind-sets will react like that. In fact very few probably would. They would mock you, completely out of character, and proceed to try to get their friends to come annoy you. I have nothing against people who don't want to role-play or nothing against people who are pure power-gamers, but I do find people who go out of their way to make other's lives miserable to be sad human beings.
<br><br>
This will destroy EQ. If there isn't a community feeling, the game will fall apart and get ridiculed, as did UO. The solutions are easy, but not foolproof. Designated servers, which 989 have already declined, would be the simplest solution. Banning people who act in an inappropriate manner is another, but UO didn't have the gall to do it, and EQ promises, but who knows? This is a business after all; paying customers are hard to get rid of. 	
<br><br>
Basically, only through hard work by those that wish to have a good gaming experience will the community succeed. We need to take the reigns and charge forth into a new gaming experience. We cannot allow the unruly ones to destroy something that promises as much as EQ does. Our future is in our hands, not anyone else's. Remember that we may be in 989's world, but we are the ones that shape it.
