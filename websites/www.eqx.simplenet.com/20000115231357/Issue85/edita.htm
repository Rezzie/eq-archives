Another first for me this week.  After a fairly good day in EverQuest where Absor obtained his first piece of shiny armor (he was getting tired of the dull foresty greens and browns of leather), I managed to log out unhappy.  Not overly so, because I knew this day would come, but unhappy nonetheless.  This week I added the first name to my ignore list.
<br><br>
I was really happy about the way my new ring mail coat looked on me, gold and silver and all shiny.  I got it for a price that made me happy (who cares if it was or wasn't a great deal, I could afford it and it was something that I really wanted).  And my partner in crime and I had been reasonably successful at overcoming somewhat unpleasant odds on the battlefield (where the hell did that OTHER grizzly come from!) with minimal deaths.
<br><br>
The sun was setting in game, and had set ages ago outside my window.  I was tired.  And after a weeks vacation I had to go to work the next day.  So I wanted to get to bed.  But, as always is the case when I'm about to log out, someone shouted that they needed help.  Instead of just letting the camping timer finish up, I clicked 'stand' and shouted my response:  "I can help you find your corpse, where are you?"
<br><br>
By now you'd think I would know better.
<br><br>
So I find the lost soul and ask him where his corpse is.  He says it's two zones away.  Well, we're at the Qeynos gates, so I figure Blackburrow and don't ask further.  Off we go.  Once in the hills my new friend stops off to kill a Gnoll scout.  I sigh.  I decide not to help him.  We were not grouped, and I was just not in the mood to stop and kill everything that might yield loot.  Besides, he was anonymous but conned green to me, so I wanted to get an idea of his level.  I knew that those scouts gave Absor trouble up until about 6th level.  This Erudite caster handled it easily enough.
<br><br>
I told him that I was tired and didn't really want to stop and watch him kill things on route.  I really didn't want to see him stop to toast every scrawny gnoll in BB on the way when I was already looking at a 5 hour nap before work the next day.  But I was still happy, cause I had my shiny coat on.
<br><br>
He then turns right at the signpost.  We're headed to Karana…  Oh poop.  This could be a long trip.  But I'm still happy.
<br><br>
Once we enter the zone I use my song to locate his corpse.  It's not there.  No corpse.  Sigh.
<br><br>
Now he had been shouting about losing his corpse due to a bug, and that the GMs refused to help him out.  So I figured that when he asked for my help he at least knew that there was a corpse, after all, the GMs had told him that they weren't going to help him retrieve it.  So I figured it was in a dangerous place (can you say Ogre?).  But no, there just wasn't one.
<br><br>
So I tell him that there is no corpse in this zone with his name on it.   I ask him if he knew about the /corpse command.  No response.  I then get him to tell me that he's fifth level.  Sigh.  I'm not at all adverse to helping out a low level character in a bind.  On the contrary, I get a bit upset at the high level folks that can't be bothered to actually look for their corpses (one's that ask me to travel for five minutes to meet them so that I can find a corpse that is a twenty second run from where we meet, laying in plain sight on the flat grounds of South Karana).  The low level folks are often new players, and I like helping new players out.  But this guy's corpse has decayed.  There's nothing I can do.
<br><br>
He then starts asking me something about food and water or some such thing.  I don't read the text carefully (dang bard songs make things scroll off screen pretty fast sometimes), and figure that he just needs some food and water for his continued adventuring.  So I hand him ten rations and waters.  He takes them, then tells me, no, he wanted to know if I would buy some food or water (or bandages) from him to help him get started.
<br><br>
I say, "Oh, and yet you took my food and water anyway…"
<br><br>
I was getting the feeling that I was being mooched.  I was feeling put upon now, so I told him that I needed to go to town to purchase some supplies for myself (I gave him all I had left) and ran off back to town.
<br><br>
I hit the bank, buy more food and water (because I KNOW I'll forget next time I log in and I hate leaving unprepared for the next adventure).  As soon as I get back into the zone where I first heard this guy shouting about his misfortune, I hear him at it again.  During the five minutes it takes me to get my supplies from Galliways I see no fewer then five messages asking for donations to help him get started.  Well heck, I just gave him a few gold worth of food, even if he sells it back to the merchants.  I was probably overreacting when I shouted back something about how he could easily have earned his lost equipment back in the time he's spent begging.  I was tired…
<br><br>
He responded with a /tell that wasn't unreasonable, asking me why I had a problem with him asking, and that if generous souls wanted to help him, why should I care.  I responded telling him that he would be better prepared for his future if he were to learn to earn his own way rather than relying on others for his survival.
<br><br>
At this time I got involved in another tell conversation with someone else about something completely unrelated, and considered the matter closed.
<br><br>
But the guy wouldn't stop.  He actually started getting rude, comments about twisting my nipples and others that need not be repeated.  All the while making it impossible for me to use /reply because his unwanted and flat out rude commentary would pop up while I was typing the reply.
<br><br>
So he went onto my ignore list.  *sighs*  I've never felt the need to ignore any other player in EverQuest.  It's easy enough to just move away from people that are too busy /saying things that I'm not interested in, like discussing the best ways to level their characters.  It's easy to avoid or not pay attention to folks that /shout things that are annoying or ooc (though I sometimes give a /tell to people that are being rude or offensive).  But this guy was disturbing my conversation, and being offensive in such a way that I had no other choice.
<br><br>
My Tanarus /ignore file was one of the largest that I knew of.  Only a few people could actually talk to me in that game.  I've even turned chat off a few times when playing.  It was the incessant foul and abusive language that was one of the main reasons that I quit.
<br><br>
I just wanted to thank the 99,999 EverQuest players that are not on my ignore list.
