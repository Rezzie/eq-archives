"<em>Hail m'lady, would you be so kind as to direct me to the nearest inn," asked a rather bedraggled looking gentleman, as I passed him on the street.  "Well met, sir, and I'd be glad to direct ye.  Turn left at the next street, and you shall see the Traveler's Inn," I replied.</em>

Ah, how I love a man who can roleplay.  I am one of the few female characters on EQ who is actually a woman in real life, and nothing makes my little elven heart pitter patter faster than a charming rogue, or a chivalrous paladin.  But by the same coin, someone attempting to talk in character (otherwise known as 'IC'), but doing a bad job of it, can get annoying quickly.  
<br><br>
I think perhaps the Bad Guys (power gamers who have no interest in RPing or staying in character)  won't stay IC because they believe it's all 'Thou art in my way' instead of 'Pardon me'.  Personally, I think talking in character isn't about <b>adding</b> affected speech to my conversation (thee, thou, etc.) so much as it is <b>keeping out</b> modern expressions, like 'cool' or 'What's up?' or a host of other things that draw away from the fantasy setting.  I think that's a mistake too many people new to roleplaying make.
<br><br>
It was difficult for me to get used to modifying what I said in the beginning.  I type pretty darned fast, and particularly if I just sat down to play and I hadn't quite 'gotten into' the game yet, modern expressions would pop out before I had time to censor myself.  But once I got into the habit of doing it, it became easier and easier - and it made EverQuest so much more fun.  Now that I have a few different characters, I have begun to experiment with different dialects and accents.  It's added even more depth to the characters I play.  
<br><br>
As a newbie roleplayer, I felt very self conscious trying to speak in character to complete strangers.  Invariably I seemed to meet some meathead who replied completely OOC, or I was ignored.  Not very encouraging.  I, for one, like the roleplay switch.  I don't feel the least bit self conscious about approaching someone who's name is in purple and speaking completely in character. Being able to toggle my RP status gave me an escape from performance anxiety if I felt intimidated or a bit embarrassed.  (I will point out that I now play IC from the moment I log in to the moment I log off.  I don't toggle my RP flag - I leave it on all the time, and I hope that encourages fledgling RPers to speak to me IC.)
<br><br>
So my advice is this, if you're new to talking in character, don't get too fancy.  A well placed old-fashioned word such as 'I shall' instead of 'I will', or an occasional ye coupled with a complete lack of modern expressions will make your speech seem more in character - and you won't have to sweat all the thee's and thou art's.  Also, try turning on your RP switch.  You may get to know more experienced RPers that way, and get a feel for the way they talk in character.  And that's not to say a 'thou art' here and there is out of line, but 'Thou art a cool chick' will always make me cringe.
