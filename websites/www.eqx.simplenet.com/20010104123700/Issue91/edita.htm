Whew.  I got a lot of mail on that last editorial.  I forgot how much mail a strongly worded opinion can generate, especially when it's about a topic that generates emotion as strongly as the term 'twink'.  I want to thank everyone that wrote in, even if you hated what I wrote.  I really do want to hear all the opinions on things.  But this week I think I'll talk about something less likely to stuff my mailbox.
<br><br>
Last weekend we gathered at a friends house to play RuneQuest (play it, you'll like it!).  The game was a blast, as usual.  But there were some interesting circumstances surrounding the game that had me thinking.  And I hate it when that happens.
<br><br>
And I've got to write this one carefully, so as not to offend people that I have to put up with…  make that people that I get the great pleasure of hanging out with on a regular basis.
<br><br>
Last Saturday we were lucky enough to have one of our friends available, one that we don't see often.  But in order for her to play, we had to go to her place.  This is good for me, since the sofa and loveseat that my aunt gave me when I moved in to my current apartment have become shreds of their former selves since we started playing regularly at my place.  I rarely sit on the things myself, folks, so maybe you guys can pitch in and help me purchase new ones for you to destroy…
<br><br>
My good fortune and the continued survival of my furniture, for one weekend at least, was brought about by the fact that my friend has a boy-child (other than her husband) to take care of.  This is not only why we never see her anymore, but also why we play at her place on those rare weekends that she's available.
<br><br>
Sitting around that table were a full load of long time gamers.  Nine of us.  All but one of us have known each other since high school.  And we've been playing games together that whole time.  This fact became a tool for our derision.  This just happened to be the same weekend that most of our hostess' family decided to drop by and poke fun at us.  You see, we used to play at her father's house often, way back when.  I got in the habit of sarcastically calling him Dad for all those years.  And we were all a bit slack-jawed when the old man walked in that afternoon and wondered aloud about how we were still doing the same thing that we were doing in high school.  I think he was at least pleased that we weren't still doing it at his house.  His son, our hostess' brother (a pest then, a pest now) commented with a bit more sting on the same matter.  I think he may have used the term loser.
<br><br>
Really?
<br><br>
I had to think about that a bit.  I guess as a gamer I've grown a bit accustomed to being considered a geek and a loser.  I've always just chalked that up to the ignorance of the one that thought that.  But he wasn't talking about what we were doing as much as he was talking about the fact that we'd been doing the same thing for close to twenty years.  Doesn't an adult find different hobbies than the ones he had in high school to spend his adult life pursuing?  Shouldn't we have moved on from playing games and found a real hobby?
<br><br>
Well, obviously not.  Role-playing is really a hobby that matures with the player, unlike many other hobbies.  When I first started playing D&D we were mostly all about getting stuff, gaining levels, building castles for our characters, raising armies of followers.  We've changed a lot since then, and so have our games.  It's now just as likely that we'll be exploring a political intrigue as a dungeon.  Our characters tend to suffer at least one moral dilemma each game.  And the power level that we tend to play with has gone down rather than up over the years.  That's the nice thing about a hobby of the imagination, it grows with you.  I suppose that's why a lot of us that had coin collections as kids don't anymore (unless we're keeping them to pass on to our own kids).  I guess as adults we want to collect bigger things than coins, like cars or stock certificates.  Coins aren't enough anymore, the old coin collection couldn't keep pace with us.
<br><br>
Some of us discussed this during our dinner break.  The Evil one defended us the easy way.  He noted that we were all gainfully employed, some of us even do socially enlightening things.  The Evil GM is a teacher (hide your children).  Admittedly, most of the rest of us work directly in the computer area, so maybe we earn the title geek.  But loser?  No, I don't think so.
<br><br>
I probably don't need to say this, since most of you have been playing games on your computers or with pen and paper for long enough to already know this.  But maybe some of you are new to this whole gaming thing.  Whatever you do, don't listen to the people that tell you to 'get a life' or anything like that.  For the most part role-players are very well adjusted.  They learn early on what a moral dilemma is.  They are, surprisingly, usually very good at social situations (against the stereotype).  Role-playing, as well as other gaming like board games and card games, teaches and entertains.  It's a hell of a lot of fun.
<br><br>
I suspect that the folks that feel the need to tell a role-player that he's a loser is, well, projecting.  When people see a bunch of other people having fun doing something incomprehensible (think back and remember how totally crazy the gamer lingo sounded when you first heard it) they can react in so many ways.  The best, of course, is with curiosity.  But some react with name calling, and that's no reflection on those having fun, it's a comment about the one doing the name calling.
<br><br>
I guess my point is simple, any hobby that entertains you (without hurting others) is a good hobby.
<br><br>
Oh, and to Dad (as if he's gonna read this…), for twenty years he's been wondering who's winning.  He used to stand behind
