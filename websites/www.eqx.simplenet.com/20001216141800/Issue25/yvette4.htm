The Mist blew along the coast of Qeynos that next morning as a small crowd
gathered to hear the shocking tale of what had happened on the ship. When the
ship reached shore Yvette, the undead and the treasure were no where to be
found. The carnage of the battle was very evident even to the casual
observer; bodies scattered about the deck of the ship and scorch marks across
the hull. As the city guards listened patiently to the two sailors and four
magic users telling the tale, all present heard a new version of what had
occurred that night.

 There was a great deal of talk of a powerful necromancer
who controlled the very threads of magic, calling fire and lightning from the
air and raising the fallen, striking out at the warrior captains ship to loot
him of his treasure before sinking the ship and killing all on board, then
turning on her own shipmates, casting vile magic and commanding the fallen
warriors to do the work of evil and greed. There was even mention that the
necromancer could change her form to that of the mist or a bat and fly away
with the treasure, leading her vile servants to her underworld home.

As more and more people gathered at the docks, even a Bard stood by to listen
to the events that he would later that day tell as a tale in the local
tavern, inspiring men with tales of the riches that were in the treasure
chest, and the valor of the helpless passengers, and most of all calling
for a great hero to put the necromancers soul to rest.
