<b>FELWITHE -</b>
<br><br> 
This week the merchants council of Felwithe reluctantly admitted that a thief gained access to their lost and found and made off with two dozen coats of assorted sizes, several combs, various looted bits of bat fur, and approximately 72 copper in spare change.
 <br><br>
"Not exactly the royal Jewels, but that's not the point," Said High-Elven spokesperson Divinia Brightstone, "Someone actually got through our impenetrable security and made off with the items."
 <br><br>
A curfew has been imposed in Felwithe for the next week while they determine if this was an inside job.  But some claim they saw a human climbing the outside walls right behind the gaurd's backs.  If this is true, this would be the most wanted man in Faydwer.
