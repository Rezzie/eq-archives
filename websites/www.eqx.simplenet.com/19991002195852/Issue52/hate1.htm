The sun had just set behind the peaks of Lavastorm, leaving behind the last traces of daylight in a blaze of purples and reds.  Perched on a small boulder just outside of the city's entrance, Veikara watched the final rays disappear, and the moon slowly creep up to light the night sky. The rise of the moon was perhaps the only thing she found to be beautiful in this world she so hated. She remained unmoved until the moon had reached it's height atop the towering peaks. Slowly she stood, stretching her back , then grabbed her boar-spear and the small backpack she had packed before leaving her home and was on her way. She did not know where she was headed but that she was just headed.  Her brother and father were both experienced Necromancers, and when they had found that she had taken up the sword and sworn the oath of the shadow warriors, they immediately disowned her and stripped her of her name and citizenship. Neither of them meaning much of anything, she left with no remorse, but her heart filled with more hatred than any dark being could have imagined its capabilities.
<br><br>
Stopping in the middle of Nektulos forest, she pulled out her dagger and sliced deep into her palm. Watching the rich, dark blood flow down her wrist and arm as she balled her hand into a tight fist, her nails digging deeper into the wound increasing the pain. She began to chant, calling to her creator and true father, Innoruuk. Chanting faster and faster, she felt her entire being ache from deep within. Faster and faster she chanted, all the while the pain increasing with each syllable. A faint dark purple aura surrounding the wounded hand, still balled in the tight fist. By this time the chant was almost involuntary and the pain beyond unbearable, but still she chanted, feeling the dark powers invading her every pore. Faster and faster until the pain was too much and she screamed, "ENOUGH!" The sound echoing throughout the forest of Nektulos. Finally it was over, her casting complete. Panting, she opened her wounded palm to find the wound healed, but instead of scar tissue being the dark ashen blue of her skin, it was an almost phosphorescent bright red strip across the palm of her hand. Perching the wound was a small white star-like symbol, four points wider and longer than the other four points that radiated out from a hollow circle. Below the red scar were two more symbols, alike to the first. Licking the blood from her dagger she hissed, "A plague upon your dreams father and dear, dear brother, till I return and fulfill those nightmares with true pain, blood and fire!" 
<br><br>
With that, she headed south towards the human inhabited East Common Lands. The moon was well into the sky by the time she had crossed the pass into the east lands. She stopped at the edge of the pass and put on her red and black velvet cloak, as so that the human guards would not recognize the dark being they were allowing to cross through their homelands. Adjusting the hood so that it concealed her dark face, she headed down the path at the edge of the pass. With spear in hand and throwing darts prepared she approached the inn that was stationed outside the city of Freeport. The guard on watch did not even glance in her direction as she sneaked passed him and entered the inn. 
<br><br>
At the front desk stood a human male, no more than thirty years in age, and all the more vile and putrid to her than that of the creatures that crawled in the wastes of  the commonlands. She glanced down at the floor, knowing that if she glanced at his face, she would be more than tempted to thrust her spear into his stomach just on the account of him being human. 
<br><br>
She threw several coins down on the table, "However much food and water this will buy me."
<br><br>
Without hesitation, he picked up the coins and exited through the door behind the counter. A few seconds later he returned with six rations of stale bread and a large bottle of Kalish. "Anything else, m'lady?" his tone was as harsh and inviting to her as a death warrant. 
<br><br>
"This will be all." She spat at him, head still bowed down towards the dirty wooden floor. She turned and headed out the door, leaving it propped open as it had been before she entered. The guard standing post was leaning against the light pole, head bowed as he slept. This was almost irresistible to her, how easy it would have been to just snap his neck. Just a quick motion, bringing death instantly. The one thought that stopped her was that he would not know her face, his dreams of human women would comfort him in his last moments. No, she would rather have him die an old, decrepit waste of a man than have him die in his peaceful slumber. She moved on towards the deserts of Ro.
<br><br>
As she stepped towards the cave, a low-toned growl sounded from behind her. She began to turn then was knocked over by a heavy blow. The puma had her pinned by the shoulders to the cold desert ground. It breathed heavily on her, smelling the excitement and small burst of fear that emitted from her pores. As it opened it's mouth, ready to tear out her throat, she swerved to the left, but not completely avoiding the puma's jaws. She let out a shriek of pain as it sunk it's razor sharp teeth into her right shoulder. With the puma preoccupied with the taste of her flesh and blood, Veikara drew out her dagger from it's sheath and plunged the blade into the puma's stomach. The puma growled in pain, but instead of letting go as she had expected, the puma tore deeper into her shoulder, almost down to the bone. She turned the dagger clockwise in the beast's stomach, causing it to bite down harder. She yelled in pain and with all her strength, thrust it upwards towards the chest, and striking the first bone of the rib cage. The beast released it's grip, weakening from the loss of blood. "Get off of me BEAST!" she whispered, the pain making it difficult to raise her voice. She pulled out the dagger and quickly thrust it into the puma's right eye, piercing the brain. 
<br><br>
Toppling the lifeless corpse off of her and to the ground, she turned and straddled it. Pulling the dagger from the eye socket, she thrust it into the rib cage of the deceased animal as hard as she could, letting out a moan of pain from the bitten shoulder, ripping a gap through the chest large enough to fit her small hand through. 
<br><br>
She reached in, searching for the heart of her lifeless attacker. Standing as she found the object of her desire, hand still implanted in the wound and wrapped tightly around the organ, she placed the free, blood soaked hand on the puma's torn belly and pulled back as hard as she could, tearing out the heart as she toppled to the ground. Sitting on the cold desert floor, she began to wring the heart, like a wet rag, into her mouth. The blood was sweet and almost relaxing. Once dried of all the arterial blood, she thrust the crushed heart aside and proceeded to clean herself of the blood that stained her left arm and hands with the dirty guild tunic she had received from the shadow knights in Neriak. She tore off a large piece of the tunic to bind her wounded shoulderand then placed the rest of the blood soaked tunic back in her bag and pulled out the bottle of Kalish and gulped almost half of the large bottle's contents.  After catching her breath, she took another mouthful of the Kalish and spit it on the wounded shoulder. At first, she winced at the sting of the alcohol on the open flesh, then found the pain reassuring of the cleansing powers of a bit of alcohol.
<br><br>

She wound the torn piece of cloth around her chest and up across the shoulder tightly so that the bleeding would slow till she was able to receive proper medical attention. After the wound was bandaged, she sat back and kicked the puma's corpse further away from her. "Wretched beast." These words were calm as if she were talking to an old friend, "Bet you didn't see that coming from a frail member of the house of Teir'Dal, errr….Ex-member. Still, you took quite a large chunk out of me, kitty" She laughed quietly to herself at the thought of how ridiculous she must look, talking to the corpse of a puma then the pain surged through her shoulder and down her neck and arm. 
<br><br>
"YOU TOOK A CHUNK OUT OF MY SHOULDER! You little son of a….." She kicked the corpse harder than the last time and then let out a sigh when she realized that it wouldn't do any good to get angry at an enemy she had already defeated. 
<br><br>
She glanced at the sky, and saw the moon hanging over the hills of the western lands and decided it was time she had best be on her way. Grabbing her backpack and putting the dagger back in it's sheath attached to her thigh, she set towards the cave. The walk seemed to last forever and the air was getting colder. It took a half an hour to cross the caves into the deserts of Ro, by that time the loss of blood was beginning to take a toll on her. She felt a little dizzy, but still she moved on through the desert sands.  The air was cold here, and when she stumbled to the ground, she felt that the sand was even colder. She picked herself up, brushed the sand off of her and pressed on. By now the moon was beginning to set into the waters that made up the oasis of Marr.
<br><br>
She kept going, passing a camp of 4 or 5 humans. They glanced in her direction and offered her a seat next to the small camp fire they were gathered around. She paid no attention their invitation, as enticing as it sounded, and kept moving along the water's edge. It was near sunrise by the time she had passed through the desert of Ro and was slowly climbing her way through the dunes of Oasis. The bleeding had finally stopped in her wounded shoulder and her head was beginning to clear up. She stopped for a minute to watch the sun arise from the waters and have a drink of what little Kalish she had left. The sun rise never really appealed to her. It's first rays were almost too much for her light sensitive eyes to bear, being that she had lived in dark caves all her life. At first she hesitated, thinking that she was in a hurry, but then realized that she had no where to be.
<br><br>
She took off the dirty cloak and laid it down on the sand, as so she would not have to deal with the itching from the tiny grains. Wincing to see all the magnificence of the morning, she sat down on the cloak, already warm from the sand below it. She fiddled in her bag for one of the rations of bread and the bloody tunic. She set the tunic beside her, on the cloak so that it would not pick up any sand and then closely inspected the bread for mold or any other foreign objects she had no desire to consume. Once satisfied with the bread, she picked up the tunic and wrung out as much blood as she could onto the ration, so she would not gag from the taste of human food. She took one bite of the bread, then one sip of the Kalish to quickly wash down the food she despised so much. Repeating this action three times, she found herself ready to vomit and then tossed the rest of the ration into the water. She licked what blood she had on her hands from ringing the tunic and then stuffed it back into the bag, drank what little was left of the Kalish and set it down beside her on the cloak. 
<br><br>
The sun felt good on her dark skin. Warmth was one thing she had never really had a care for "A petty human pleasure" as she called it. Despite what she had originally perceived, she actually began to think about other pleasures she had scorned. As her mind began to wander, she became oblivious to the outside world.  As she sat, in deep thought and relaxed by the sun, thoughts raced through her mind of all the new pleasures that she was concealed from in the caves of Neriak. Consumed with thought, she did not notice the stranger come from behind.
<br><br>
"Well, well, well. Lookie here ladies and gentlemen! A sewer rat! Now why would you guess that a sewer rat would be in our deserts and so far from it's 'ome?" A man's voice, toned with the accent of a seaman and hoarse like that of a man who spent too much time at the smoke houses in his younger days. Veikara quickly came back to reality and readied her dagger in case this fool dared to begin a battle.
<br><br>
Before she could act, she found herself restrained and disarmed. She squirmed a little, to test the restrainer's strength and found that he was too powerful for her to overtake in a hand to hand battle as he tightened his grip around her neck and forced her arm up from behind the back. 
<br><br>
"Now little rat, are you going to be a good little lass and answer me question, or shall I 'ave to force that tongue o' your's to speak?" He breathed heavily on her neck and ear and tightened his grip and quickly jerked the restrained arm higher towards the neck. She grunted in pain, but still did not answer. 
<br><br>
"Lass, I will nae ask again. Please, go a'ead and answer and don't be shy." The smell of alcohol reeked from his breath as he drew closer, almost causing her to vomit from the stench. She felt his grip tighten and knew that if he pulled her arm any higher, it would break. 
<br><br>
"You did not make the question clear." She quickly spat in a low growl. 
<br><br>
"Oh I didn't m'rat lady? Forgive me then… shall I repeat it so that those little pointed rat ears may 'ear correctly and that that little rat mouth may answer?" His tone was quiet and gentle as if he were speaking to a child.
<br><br>
"Please, do." She whispered. The man's grip on her neck made it difficult to to breathe.
<br><br>
He loosened his grip a little on her arm and allowed her to breathe freely again. She gasped and relaxed into this man's arms, for she knew she was not going anywhere. 
<br><br>
"Per'apse we should just forget about the questions for now, little rat…" he drew closer so that his jaw was brushing against her cheek as he spoke, "and throw away all perceived prejudices." He bit her gently on the jaw line, sliding his tongue along the flesh between his teeth. She closed her eyes and for one moment, the man's actions excited her. Affection of any kind was never expressed to her in all of the eighteen years she had been alive. 
<br><br>
Breathing heavily and heart racing, she tilted her head back and onto the man's large shoulder. He released his grip from her neck and grazed the back of his fingers along her throat. He whispered in her ear, "My invitation entices you, yes?" He ran his lips across the cartilage and up her pointed ear. His actions greatly sparked her curiosity and at the same time, disgusted her. 
<br><br>
She turned her face so that her mouth was near his ear, noticing that it had a slight point as hers did, "What interests would you have in 'a little rat' that would cause such actions?" Her voice was extremely feminine with slightly high tones and gentle syllables. 
<br><br>
He laughed quietly. "Little rats have their uses."
<br><br>
Quickly, she jerked away from him, testing his convictions and motives. Whether he would kill her or pursue his intentions. He grabbed hold of her arm once again. thrusting it back towards her spine and held her own dagger to her throat. "Or per'apse I should just slit that beautiful little throat o' yours now…" His voice was still calm and erotic, "but 'tis a shame to let it go to waste, little rat." 
<br><br>
She winced as he cut gently into her neck, not deep enough to do any real harm. "Believe me little rat, you will die one way or another, but some ways are more," he jerked the blade a little deeper into the small cut in her throat "painful and 'orrible than others, w'ile some can be," he moaned and ran his lips across her ear again, "a little less brutal."
<br><br>

Un-tensing and more excited than before, she turned her head back towards his face and sat up so that she was no longer leaning into his chest. He released her arm and ran his fingers up her spine and neck and through her long, white curly hair. He took the blade away from her throat and slid it down her face, leaving a small stripe of blood down her cheek. 
<br><br>
"You are not one for choosing times and places to commit such actions." She ran her eyes across him. He was knelt down with one knee in the sand and the other leg was bent so that the knee was forward, hovering above the sand. His clothes were very old and tattered. The leggings were a faded black leather and boots were made of the same fading leather, but tan in color and had wolf skin crowning them just below his knees. The shirt he wore was stained in blood and sweat from previous days spent fighting. She glanced quickly in his face, just to see who her seducer was. Not terribly handsome, but not terribly grotesque in her eyes. His face showed human features, but they were a little sharper and more elf-like than that of a human. His eyes were brilliant shade of greens and blues which starred at her from behind locks of wavy, matted black hair, hanging just above his shoulders. His face was unshaven and boar a large crescent-shaped scar from below his right eye down to the crack of his thin lips. In his entirety, he was not large of frame, but larger than that of the largest elf and slightly leaner than the average human.
<br><br>
"Are you pleased with what you see, rat?" He flashed a crooked smile and tilted his head slightly towards the left. She began to stand, but he quickly grabbed her by the collar of her low, revealing shirt. "Where do you think are 'eaded, little rat?" 
<br><br>
She smiled gently and reached up to touch his matted hair. He quickly glanced at the blue hand that was reaching to touch him, then quickly shifted his eyes back to hers. "My, my, my, little rat! If I didn't know w'ich end was up, I would suspect that you were trying to seduce me." He chuckled quietly at this thought, then quickly pulled her forward by the shirt he still had his hand tightly griped on so that their noses gently touched.
<br><br>
Veikara wrinkled her nose and smiled wildly. "Keil'kad dorem mai'eela raen nor d'mic leiee modari!". She gently pulled closer to his right ear and whispered, " I thought it was the other way around."
<br><br>
Veikara turned her eyes towards her spear, which her attacker had failed to notice. His eyes followed, noticing the spear as well. "Tsk tsk tsk. I can only imagine what is going through you little rat brain. Go a'ead," he released his grip, "go get your weapon." Veikara stood and quickly darted for her spear. Before she could grab it, he quickly picked it up and then thrust the blunt end of her dagger, which he was still in possession of, into the back of her head. The force of the blow alone knocked her to the ground, unconscious. 
<br><br>
Pleased with his actions, he tucked Veikara's dagger into his belt and then knelt down towards her unconscious body. He turned her over so that her face was no longer buried in the sand, wiped the sand off of her face and then covered her in the cloak, placing the hood over her face. Quickly he tossed her body over his shoulder and began to run along the coast towards the southern end of the desert.
