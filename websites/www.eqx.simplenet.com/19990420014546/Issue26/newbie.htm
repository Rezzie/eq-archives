Remember when you were a newbie?
<br><br>
The first time someone gave you a few gold coins, or a morsel of bread, how
grateful you were. You would thank that person repeatedly.   Hanging out in
donation waiting for gifts from the gods to drop down.  Standing for hours at
the fountain begging everyone in sight to take you leveling.  Remember
playing with socials for the first time?  Fart, Burp, greet, sneeze, pout,
just to name a few.

I can remember when I started playing my first MUD.  It was my first
experience with multiplayer games.  I was in college and a friend of mine
took me to the computer lab on a Saturday afternoon.  He said he had been
playing this game for several months, and that I should give it a try.  We
arrived at the lab and logged on the server.  First we rolled me up a
character, and then entered the game.  After a few minutes in donation,
loading up with newbie equipment, we took off for some island.  Grouped with
him, we started killing things for experience.  I maxed out in experience and
we headed back to town for leveling.  I trained with my instructor and gained
my levels I had earned.  Then I was able to practice a few new spells.   Holy
cow!  I could now create food, and water.  We continued to adventure.

All I remember is looking at my watch sometime later, and it was Sunday
afternoon.   We had been playing for 19 hours straight.  
<br><br>
I played that MUD almost every day for the next year, and I was still only
half way from maxing out in abilities and levels.   I can remember living
that MUD for that year.  It was usually on my mind throughout the day at
school.  I'd plan what I was going to do that night when I got online.
It was very addictive.
