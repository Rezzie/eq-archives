There are moments in Halas where I am sure that I am in the home of the gods, despite what all the myths may say.  Even here amid the igloos, the evening sky turned ashen gray by the thick blanket of clouds, that even these miserable goblin homes can seem almost sainted.

Inariis paced back and forth in her small, private meeting-chamber, her soft leather boots making hardly any sound at all on the thick, purple rug that covered the floor. An octagonal table stood by the far wall, but she had removed three chairs and put them together for the informal gathering. She looked at her two brothers. Aunrar sat in a high-backed chair to her right, his back straight and wearing an openly irritated expression; she had probably interrupted him in some experiment, which would make him stingy for quite a while<b>...</b>

	Was it worth it? Was it worth spending almost my entire existence learning the Art? Some may say that I have wasted my life, that I have thrown it away in pursuit of something that can not be mastered, something that can never be obtained; magic.

The sun was just rising over the horizon when Aklar, Druid of the 9th level, struck camp.  Her belongings neatly stowed in her backpack, she performed her daily ritual of thanks to Tunare, and was on her way.  The flat plains of Western Karana stretched out around her for miles. In the distance she saw a pride of lions bounding along, and altered her path to skirt wide around them.  Druids lived in harmony with all of nature, but she had been forced to kill a young lioness that had attacked her yesterday, and feared the smell of its blood would enrage these<b>...</b>
