The tunnels beneath were as deserted as the ground above.  Aklar, Anthiel and Greygar descended slowly into the fetid depths of the Burrow, their dim lights flickering on the rounded walls.  Nauseating smells rose up at them as they made their cautious way deeper.  The uneven planks were choked with dirt and the occasional bone.  The place was as silent as the grave.
<br><br>
The tunnel finally opened into a wide room, far below the surface.  The dirt and planks gave way to rock, and there was sound at last.  The distant lapping of water made the cavern a whispering, murmuring echo chamber.  Every boot scrape against the floor rippled away into the endless dark, and came back transformed into a susurration of sound. The three companions stood close by one another, taking comfort in the contact.
<br><br>
"Where now, my friend," asked Freygar, and immediately wished he hadn't.  END…End…end…came back at them from the gloom, and Anthiel shivered.  She shook her head, and then stepped away from the other two.  They followed, wary eyes opened as wide as possible.
<br><br>
"Can you see?" she asked Anthiel quietly.  Eee…eee…the dark sighed back.
<br><br>
"No, there is something…" The Elf shook his head in confusion.  "It is like spider webs, gray mist over everything.  I can see no further than the lights allow."
<br><br>
"I'll wager the Gnolls can see in this…muck," snarled Freygar.
<br><br>
"We must keep moving.  The water seems to be that way," she nodded off to the right.  Aklar felt her way forward. 
<br><br>
The water grew louder and louder, until they were standing at the edge of a great clear lake, dimly lit from within.  The rocky bottom itself seemed to have an eldritch glow, and strange fish flickered to and fro.  Across, the other side was just visible.  A doorway, cut into the living rock, was outlined by the firelight beyond.
<br><br>
"There," said Aklar.  "It must be the way into the Deeper Burrow."  She spoke quietly. The echoes were only a distant muttering on the outside edge of hearing.
<br><br>
"There is no easy way across," said Freygar uneasily, looking up and down the shoreline.  "Maybe if we went further left…"
<br><br>
"We can swim," said Anthiel, pulling off his boots.
<br><br>
"Agreed," said Aklar, and set down her pack to imitate him.
<br><br>
"Swim?" Freygar sounded appalled at the very notion.
<br><br>
"Swim," answered Anthiel, tying his boots to his pack.  "Surely you know how to swim?"  Freygar looked at the water and then at Aklar, who sat on the edge of the pool, with one boot in her hand and one still on her foot.  Anthiel followed his gaze.  "You don't." It wasn't a question.
<br><br>
"The water is not deep, Freygar.  I'm sure you can wade."  Aklar patted his foot comfortingly and pulled off her other boot.
<br><br>
"Wade. Of course.  Why did I not think of that?" he muttered as he reluctantly tugged off his chain mail.
<br><br>
Slightly damp, and in Freygar's case, a trifle wild-eyed, the three made it safely to the other shore.  The doorway was over ten feet high, and as wide, the door within it rough hewn wood.  Golden light spilled through cracks in long fading ribbons across the stone.  Aklar crept silently to the door and put her eye to a narrow gap.  Anthiel and Freygar crouched near her, keeping lookout as best they could in the encroaching dark.
<br><br>
The chamber was lit by several roaring torches, their unnatural flames rising in straight unwavering lines.  An enormous slab of stone served as a table, a heavy wooden chair squatting at each end.  The room was filled with Gnolls, standing guard in lines along the walls. In the chair facing the door, the High Shaman himself sat, glowering at the occupant of the other chair.  Its back rose a good five paces from the floor, and Aklar could see nothing of who sat there.
<br><br>
"So it is agreed?" the voice of the unseen person was a smooth and mellifluous baritone.  It sent shivers down Aklar's back.  It was… cold. Evil.
<br><br>
The High Shaman leaned forward, muzzle writhing with suppressed snarls.
<br><br>
"It is agreed if you provide the Ritual of Azgoreth, as was promised!  I have gathered my people, prepared the way, and still I see nothing <em>but</em> promises.  My preparations cannot go unnoticed much longer.  I need assurances.  I need something solid and real."  The Commander standing behind him shifted, eyes fixed coldly on the unseen speaker.
<br><br>
"As agreed, then." An arm came into Aklar's view, clad in deep purple. The slim gloved hand tossed a heavy leather-bound tome carelessly on the table.  The Shaman leaned forward eagerly to pull in toward him.  He opened it, scanning the pages quickly.  A smile crossed his face.
<br><br>
"Agreed… my worthy ally.  What of the Avatar?"
<br><br>
"She will appear.  She will be unable to stay away, once the Ritual is begun and Mammoth's blood stains the altar."  Aklar felt as if she'd been kicked in the stomach.  Her breath left her in a rush, and she wavered on the edge of a thoughtless rage, wanting to rip the door open and rid the world of the evil within.  She loosened her aching, white-knuckled grip on her warhammer with an effort.
<br><br>
"Then we are both satisfied."  The Shaman closed the book and laid it on the table before him, caressing it with hooked claws.
<br><br>
"Good."  The Gnolls seemed unaware of the barely veiled contempt in his voice, but Aklar shivered again.  He rose, and she barely suppressed a gasp.  The unseen speaker was a Dark Elf.  Pale silver hair spilled down his back and as he turned, she could see that it framed a dusky face so beautiful that it was an effort to see the cruel twist to his sensual lips, the frozen cold of his blue eyes.  He came toward the door, but before Aklar could think to pull away, he paused and faced the Shaman once again.
<br><br>
"My father will expect to see the agreed upon forces arrive within two months time," he told the Shaman.
<br><br>
"Two months!" the Shaman sputtered.  "That is barely enough time to secure Surefall, much less finish the assault on Qeynos.  It cannot be done!"
<br><br>
"Cannot?"  The Elf seemed to be tasting the word.  "Cannot."
<br><br>
Despite the massed Gnolls, despite the looming presence of the Commander behind him, the Shaman shrank back in his seat as the Elf leaned forward, spreading his hands delicately on the table.  "Once the Ritual has been performed, you will have no need for assaults on anything.  Simply sit back and watch.  If that's not too much risk for you."  The contempt in was clear in his voice this time, crystalline and cutting.
<br><br>
The Commander stepped forward, snarling openly, and the Shaman barked an order at him in the gutteral Gnoll tongue.
<br><br>
"It will be as you say.  My Lord."
<br><br>
"Much better."  The Elf straightened slowly.  The Gnolls shifted and muttered, but the Shaman dropped his gaze and clutched at the book. 
<br><br>
The Elf turned to leave and Aklar jerked back with a gasp.
<br><br>
"Time to go," she whispered urgently.  Her companions were on their feet in an instant, and they fled along the shore of the lake, concealing their lights and searching for cover.  They reached a small overhang of rock just as the door creaked loudly open behind them.  Aklar leaned cautiously out.  The Dark Elf stepped out, his shadow bisecting the wash of light that spilled across the rock.  He paused, and his head turned slowly toward their hiding place.  His eyes seemed to fix directly on hers.  Aklar pulled back, pressing herself against the stone, heart thumping.  Anthiel laid a hand on her shoulder.  Freygar looked at her with wide eyes, and pulled his sword partly free of the scabbard.
<br><br>
"High Shaman," the beautiful voice was distinctly amused.  "I think you may have uninvited guests."
<br><br>
"Damn," growled Freygar, and wrenched his sword free. The ring of steel filled the air with a thousand shivering echoes.  Anthiel's grip became painfully tight.
<br><br>
"They are plotting to murder Mammoth, despoil Surefall and invade Qeynos.  They were talking of the Ritual of Azgareth, and the Avatar," Aklat told them urgently, stumbling over the unfamiliar words.  A howl rose in the room, punctuated by the rising voice of the commander ordering his troops.  Gnolls poured out of the door in a grey tide.  "One of us must live to get the message through! Run and do not stop for any reason!"  Aklar leapt out of hiding and dived into the lake.  Anthiel followed with quick grace, and Freygar paused only to bellow defiance at the charging Gnolls before following.
<br><br>
They floundered through the water, stumbling on the uneven footing, Freygar heavy and clumsy in his chainmail.  The other side grew steadily closer, but faster still they could hear the Gnolls gaining on them.  In the darkness to either side the sounds of pursuit were already parallel.
<br><br>
"They are herding us!" gasped Anthiel.
<br><br>
"I know," Aklar said grimly.  Freygar spared no breath for speech.
<br><br>
They scrambled out onto dry rock and Anthiel darted in front of Aklar.  "Follow," he said tersely, and they ran after him.  Gnolls were on both sides, somewhere in the dark, and Aklar's darting eyes painted their swift shapes in every shifting shadow.  Anthiel, elven sight now apparently finding a way where before he'd been blind, led them unerringly across the vast chamber.
<br><br>
Freygar cried out behind Aklar, and she spun, freeing her warhammer.  Two Gnolls had come up behind them unseen and Freygar was fighting them desperately.  One circled him, cutting him off from escape.  Anthiel disappeared into the darkness ahead, unaware of Freygar's plight.  Aklar ran back, engaged one of the Gnolls, and prayed that they could find one another again in the endless night.  With his attention no longer split between two adversaries, Freygar easily took down one Gnoll, and then fell on Aklar's opponent.  He was soon dead, and Aklar slung her hammer and prepared to cast healing magic on her stalwart friend.
<br><br>
Freygar grabbed her arm and flung her on ahead of him.  She broke into a run again, her cheeks burning with shame.  She had jeopardized their chances.  No going back she'd said, for whatever reason, and then proved herself to be without the discipline to follow her own orders.  Slight wounds from the Gnoll's teeth and claws burned with her sweat.  Howls rose from every direction now.  Freygar's wounds had to be worse than her own, but they could not, dared not stop to treat them.  She prayed fervently that they were travelling in the right direction.
<br><br>
Then, ahead of them, a pale shape took form in the dark.  Anthiel was facing them, face anxious.  As he saw them, he stepped toward them, and then spun and ran on, leading once again.  Aklar glanced over her shoulder, and adrenaline lent wings to her feet.  30 or more Gnolls were directly behind them, running in frightening silence.
<br><br>
They hit the far wall and ran left, following Anthiel's lead.  Suddenly he seemed to vanish, and Aklar's heart contracted, before she realised that he had found the entrance.  She fled up the narrow tunnel, her breath sobbing in her ears, Freygar's wide back in front of her.  She could feel the hot breath of the lead Gnoll on her neck.
<br><br>
Claws caught in her leather leggings and she fell, breath jolting out of her lungs, weapon spinning away against the wall.  She struggled to breathe, to stand, to cast a spell.  Rough paws hauled her to her feet, thrust her face first against the wall.  The rank smell of Gnoll filled her nostrils.  A dirty gag was shoved at her mouth, and she twisted her head to avoid it, forced air into her lungs.
<br><br>
"Run! They are behind you!" she screamed up the tunnel.  The gag was thrust in her mouth, muffling her cry.  Her arm was twisted behind her, raising her to her toes in pain.  Three Gnolls dragged her back down the tunnel, and the rest went up after her friends.  Tears of frustration and pain welled in her eyes.
<br><br>
The Dark Elf waited at the bottom of the tunnel with the High Shaman beside him.  She was forced to her knees before them, and held there by her captors.  The Elf looked down at her, a small smile plying about his mouth.
<br><br>
"Interesting…" he murmured, pursing his lips.  "And who might you be?"  He stripped one glove off, and lifted her chin with a slender finger.  His touch was as cold as death.  Aklar tried to still the trembling of her limbs.  The Shaman snarled, flexing his claws.  She wrenched her eyes away from the Elf's.  He laughed musically and turned away.  "Keep her alive for now.  I will want to question her later.  Perhaps after that I will let you…play."  The Commander snapped an order, and her world went black as something crashed heavily down on her head.
