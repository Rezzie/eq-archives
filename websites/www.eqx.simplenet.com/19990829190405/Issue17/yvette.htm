The dust billowed forth in thick, choking clouds. Curtains of spider silk swayed gently at the disturbance in the corridor. No one had been in this tower for centuries and the stagnant air pushed away from Yvette, as if it shunned the presence of the living. The sand that was everywhere seemed to absorb all sound, and it muffled even the light in the room. The Tower has been buried for over a hundred years, and lost to mankind for even longer. It was tipped in the earth, making the climb up the main tower stairs very interesting and some rooms were very inaccessible, being now overhead instead of upright. No natural light would ever find its way into this place, at least not in anyone's lifetime. Yvette's lantern cast long shadows into the main library ruins at the top of the stairs.

All of the books lay scattered about in piles at one end of the room from when the tower was cast into the earth. Shattered remains of the tables as shelves obstructed much of the room. One could note small remains of vials and other alchemy tools mixed in the heaps of wood and stone. The occasional bone or skull of a former resident jutted out of the rubble. Yvette noted that a good deal of the bones were mostly worn away, and she examined one closely to see the gnaw marks of a rodent. Looking now around the room again she noted more signs of the rodents, an she decided that it was indeed the rats that led her here. Silly that the vermin are so often dismissed as pests. She let out a sigh, which echoed throughout the tower in a frightening manner. It sounded like a breath of unholy life within the deep earth.

Looking at the huge pile of books she knew that there was years of research to do, and the sooner she started the better. Carefully she selected a table top from the pile, looking for one not too warped or broken. She found the proper supports to make a table in the unevenly tipped room. Then she began separating the books, digging through ages of lost tomes, journals, records and tales. Yvette wondered what lost arcane spells she would find here, and thought back on the folk lore of who was supposed to have lived during the time of this tower. The first of the Erudites, still full of the blood of Qeynos nobles and striving for the truth found in the great mathematics and weights of the arcane. They lived a life that symbolized a higher meaning than bloodshed and war. Living to prove the Barbarians far primitive and the nomadic ways of the other men inferior.
