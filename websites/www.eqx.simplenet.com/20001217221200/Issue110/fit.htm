Hoi there! Lrets D'pearl here with the latest an' greatest in news across the lands of Norrath! First up a follow up with further confirmation of the dreaded landshark! Apparently ... this fearsome predator has pretty much wiped out all munchies in the Qeynos sewers and has decided to strike above ground. Beware, as it seems this fiendish creature has now taken to ambushing people just outside of their rooms on board cruise boats and other maritime vehicles. Rumor has it that he entices people out of their rooms by calling himself Isaac an' offering free drinks at the ships barge... or posing as the captain an' inviting the hapless victim to dine at the captain's table.  
<br><br>
Note to all readers who plan on taking pleasure cruises in the future!  There is NO such name as a Captain Steubing registered in the maritime records of cruise captains in Qeynos, nor is their such thing as "Special Fantasy Island Giveaway". Do NOT... I repeat DO NOT open ye'r doors if'n ye'r offered any of these things!

In other news on the other side of the world... racial tensions flare as wood elves refuse to observe National Elevator Operators day. Wood elves of Kelethin were faced with picket lines and rioters who did all they could to prevent people from using the elevators this past week, when Kelethin government officials decided to go ahead and run their elevators last Tuesday; A day that is universally recognized as the birthday of the creator of the elevators of Kelethin. When asked as to what he felt about the High Elves insistence on observing this holiday, an anonymous wood elf responded.... "&lt;Snort&gt; Now WHY should we observe the holidays for some high up mucky muck types! Yeah yeah... so they helped us make our elevators! But WE'RE the ones that maintain an' operate 'em... and yeesh! WE don't go around makin' our cities <a href="../Issue77/fit.htm">walk off into the horizon</a>!!!!
