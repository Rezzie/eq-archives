EverQuest Express's Fans Speak
<br><br>
A few days ago I met with a huge EverQuest supporter / fan for the first time.  I have seen his picture in photos taken from E3, and observed him many times online in #Everquest, but never really took the time to talk.   It is with great pleasure that I bring you my interview with SeVeN also know as SeV.  I asked him if he minded being interviewed, which he quickly accepted.  He brought to my attention the fact that he had had zeros sleep, and was up all night working on his new and upcoming web site. 
<br><br>
Here is what SeV had to say.
<br><br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Seven tell our readers, who you are, what you do, and what you like."
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <em>[Laughs]</em> "Well I'm currently an under grad at Harvard, doing some entrepreneur business right now, which I can't talk about.   I do some writing for a new gaming site, which will come online in the next few weeks." 
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Site?  What's this new site?"
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "The site is <a href="http://www.wewp.com">http://www.wewp.com</a> and you can expect it in about 2 weeks, maybe less if we can work out the kinks in our backend.  It's coming along quite nicely."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "What are you doing with this game site to make it different from the rest?
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Well the site was started by a bunch of old friends, mostly dedicated gamers, and the question of how we are going to differentiate ourselves from the other sites is a major topic among our discussions.  We have all the typical stuff you'll find in a professional site.  We have a couple of industry insiders doing columns for us, of which I can't reveal.  We will not be doing good reviews for bad games.  Unlike some other sites or magazines might do.   The game companies have nothing to threaten us with."
<br><br>
<em>[Laughter]</em>
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   There are certain game companies out there that have policies set to not release press kits to sites or mags that do a bad reviews.  I don't want to name those companies, but they exist.  What we strive to achieve with this site is unbiased reviews.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "What does it take to run a major site like that?"
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Well first off all it'll require is the dedication of a group of people.  We have around 15 people doing different genres.  You also need a commitment on everyone's part to meet deadlines.  A nice backend to automate posting of stuff.  This is especially important since most of us are in different parts of the country.  The next and most important thing is a relationship with the game companies, know the people working on the games, know the PR dept and how to handle the marketing types.  Then there is travelling to visit the companies."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many hours would you say you work on this site per day? 
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "I put in about 3-5 hours a day into this site."  
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Getting back to your question about hobbies"  
<br><br>
<em>[He thinks a minute and adds]</em>
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  " I like to watch beautiful women."&nbsp;&nbsp;  <em>[Laughter]</em>
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Like the two at E3?"&nbsp;&nbsp;   <em>[I grin]</em>
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Well yeah, I actually took two pictures with them.  I only posted one of them."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <em>[Snicker]</em> I wont ask what happen in the other photo.  I picture some nude scene, in a hot tub, at the Hyatt.  
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Tell me about your first experience with an Online Multiplayer game.  Did you get addicted?"
<br><br>      
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "I think it was probably quake.  I was still living in the dorms then, so I had a nice connection and ran a server for most of the old #ultima ops.  I remember playing so much of it that I almost went on academic probation."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Yup that's what id call addiction."&nbsp;&nbsp;  <em>[I laugh]</em>
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "In your opinion, where do you think online gaming is heading?  Is this a short-lived fad, or is this just the beginning?   Do you think the Holodeck is just around the corner for us?"
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Well we all want the holodeck, but let me be brief and straight forward with this.  Massive online games is way ahead of its time.  The infrastructure of the net isn't capable of handling it, thus all the lag problems.  In my humble option, the PC servers aren't capable of handling the load either.  Specifically the ones using Intel chips.   UO has lots of server lag because they are using Intel based servers.  There was a time when they were considering using a Sparc server.  I guess the hardware was too expensive, or it'll take too much time to port the server code over to Solaris.  Either way the PC servers are proving that they can't handle the load.  Couple that with the way TCP/IP was designed and the over utilizing of the net."  
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You think IPV6 will improve gaming?"
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "IPV6 will alleviate some problems, but then IPV6 is still on paper.  We'll find out when it's standard."
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "But to continue, massive online RPGs are the wave of the future, and I wouldn't rule them out as just a short lived fad.  EverQuest, so far, is the most impressive attempt that's actually come close to providing what they claim.  UO was a great experiment gone sour."  
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "I talk a lot about my wife and family, and the way my computer habits/addiction effects our lives at home.  How about you?  Are you married?"
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "No I'm not married, actually I'm currently single, so I don't have anyone complaining that I spend too much time gaming.  I just broke up early this year, and I'm enjoying single life for now.  At least I can go to strip clubs without worrying about being shot when I get home.   When the EverQuest site was started over at scorched I spent a lot of time on EQ related stuff, and even more so when I quit scorched and moved to Moongates.  Now I spend about fifteen minutes a day catching up on EQ news.  I try to give Shon Damron an email or phone call at least twice a month to see how EQ is doing.  I'm planning a visit to 989 sometime in august when I do a massive PR related trip for this gaming site I'm working on right now.  More details will be announced when my plans are finalized."  
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "So what's 'news' at Moongates?"
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "At this point in time I'm too busy with this new gaming news site to give attention to the EverQuest site at Moongates, which is why the site hasn't been updated aggressively.  Also I don't believe in generating pointless stuff just to be able to update the site. The site gets updated when I feel that there is sufficient new stuff, or that something is important enough to justify a post.  I don't want to run a site that reports everything that happens under the sun."                                                               
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Speaking of EQ again.  You turned down the beta.   Why?
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "When I met the 989 Studios people at E3 they wanted the whole bunch of us to help them out with beta testing since we actually took the time and money to go see them at E3.  I guess we sort of showed them that we are serious gamers.  I think that impressed them.  The big reason I declined to be in the beta, at least in the early stages, was the fact that I don't have the time to be a serious tester.  I care enough for this game to want only the best gamers and testers to be in the early phases."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "I don't think you would have been just wasting space."  <em>[I smiled]</em>
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Well I did have a little chat with Brad about the beta.  I told him what I thought about how they were proceeding with the beta test, NDA and all.  I think he agrees with me for the most part that having a good bunch of early testers was essential to making this game all that it can be.  The results wouldn't be as productive with just a small group of very dedicated testers.  It'll become more of a server stress test than anything else, testing and not so much on playing.  I think they took their time to select a good group of testers."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "There always seems to be hundreds of guilds that pop up before the release of an online multiplayer game.  How do you feel about guilds?"
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Well I feel that guilds contribute greatly to the role playing experience, if done right.  However there are too many guilds out there that just pop up overnight without much planning.  This has given guilds a bad reputation.  Sometimes it might be hard to meet up with your fellow guild mates, especially if you live in different time zones.  Also it often becomes a moot point to join a guild.  On the whole, I think guilds are a good compliment to the gaming experience."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Will SeV the Great, be joining or creating a guild for EverQuest?"
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Well I'm not great, and actually I've been with a guild since the early UO days."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok magnificent SeV?
<br><br>
<em>[I snicker]</em>
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "How about just plain SeVeN?"
<br><br>
<em>[I laugh]</em>
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Ravens of Fate is my guild. We keep a pretty low profile."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Ok on a serious note.  I have to ask everyone this question.  If you came across Razor in your in-game travels, would you give him money and possessions?"
<br><br>
<em>[SeV Laughs]</em>
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Well if you asked nicely.  Actually it will depend on what your character is.  Role-playing is an important part of the EverQuest experience for me.  So if I'm playing a paladin, don't expect me to give a shadow knight money."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Oh.  I'm a little wood elf.  
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Harmless."
<br><br>
<em>[We laugh]</em>
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "On a serious note, do you feel EverQuest will live up to the name its fans are creating for it? 
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Did you read the preview I wrote up at Moongates? The one that was done in collaboration with you guys at EverQuest Express and Gamewise."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "I did but please refresh my old memory."
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "I think I pretty much summed up my feelings about it.  I didn't have high expectations for EverQuest.  Especially after the Ultima Online fiasco, but what I saw at E3 changed my mind, especially during some idle conversation with Brad.  So to make a long story short, I think if it continues on the path it is on, barring any accidents, it will live up to the hype."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking about gaming companies as a whole, not just multiplayer games, do you think the quality Vs quantity is getting out of hand with most of these game companies?"
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "I think this quality vs. quantity is getting out of hand with the explosion of the net.  The computer gaming industry exploded in potential profits, and thus many game companies are releasing tons of lousy games to give themselves more presence.  If you look at the number of game companies out there and look at the number of good games, you can see a huge discrepancy.  I don't think I can count past ten companies who haven't released a really bad game. In my humble opinion, it only hurts us gamers in the long run.  If more companies could be like Blizzard or id, it would be heaven for us gamers."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Last question.  If you had just one wish, one thing you would like to see included in EverQuest, what would it be, and why?"
<br><br>
<em>[Pause]</em>
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Hmm."
<br><br>
<em>[Pause]</em>
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "You like to ask hard ones don't you."
<br><br>
<em>[I laugh]</em>
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Well I guess it would have to be a software mode for two reasons.  One, I can play EverQuest while I'm travelling using my laptop, and two, more people would be able to enjoy EverQuest."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "SeVeN.   I have one request."
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Sure I'd be glad to help out."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "When you become famous, and you will, remember old Razor ok?"
<br><br>
<em>[He Laughs]</em>
<br><br>
<b>SeV:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "If I become famous, which I doubt, even if the wewp.com site becomes famous, nobody would know me.  I'm the backend guy."
<br><br>
<em>Always the humble guys.</em>
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Thanks again for the interview.  I look forward to seeing you online."
