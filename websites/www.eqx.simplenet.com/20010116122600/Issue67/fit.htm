Qeynos - 
<br><br>
The young bard shivered and wondered again why he was doing this, but shrugged as he knew there was no way he was going to let this juicy bit of information get away from him without checking it out. Lrets D'pearl, aspiring Bard extraordinaire and cub reporter for Fit to Print, crouched into the dark corner looking into the subterranean hall he had snuck into. He had heard vague whisperings of a dark cult or group who may have been hiding in the sewers beneath Qeynos. Tales of disappearing people and horrific acts were said to occur down in the bowels of the city. It was just too much of a story for the bard to let go, so now he found himself crouching in the damp and slimy passageways berating himself for his incorrigible curiosity. 
<br><br>
<em>*Sigh*</em> "Well... I better get on with this, the sooner I find out what's going on the sooner I can leave ..." With that, he stepped lightly out into the passageway and hurried along it towards a chamber from which he had heard a strange clanking sound that would soon be followed by a high pitched scream that relayed, in no uncertain terms, some form of unimaginable pain. 
<br><br>
As he approached the chamber, the process happened again ... <em>CLANK! SLAM! SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</em> This time followed by the triumphant cry of a man .... "Hah! It worked! It worked! Now we'll finally be able to put one up on those filthy Gnomes! We shall overcome them with this creation! AHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAH!" The man broke off into mad cackling, and Lrets did all he could to keep from loosing his dinner as he looked in on a scene of utter horror!

The man cried out again, "Horace! Look! I've perfected the giant rat trap! it works beautifully! With automation and streamlined manufacturing processes we'll be able to undercut the pricing on those gnomes and outsell them in days! They'll never know what hit them!  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAAA!" 
<br><br>
Lrets convulsed and ran from the chamber and out of the sewers, he needed to escape the claustrophobic confines of this place. Upon climbing out of the sewers he promptly planted his rump at a table at Crows and proceeded to get himself drunk beyond comprehension. Curious bystanders and customers would ask Crow what was the matter with the bard in the corner, but he could only reply, telling them, "I don't know! He keeps babbling about some horror, the horror, entrepreneurial and competitive marketing has arrived in Qeynos". He shrugged, "Don't mind 'im tho', Ye know how them artsy fartsy bards can get" As the young bard continued to shake his head in drunken stupor and babble about such arcane terms as "First price fixing, then labor unions, and then medical benefits and worker's comp! Ohhhhh!" Thankfully he passed out into the bliss of unconsciousness, hopefully to forget the horrors of what he had just witnessed

From Lrets D'pearl, Hungover with no idea what he did last night, but still aspiring Bard extraordinaire and self titled Cub Reporter :)
