I got a smile last week.  I had occasion to send Brad McQuaid an e-mail of a reasonably urgent type, and he responded.  Sure, that made me happy, but it's not what made me smile.  It was a question that he asked me at the end of his response.  He asked me, simply, if I had forgiven him for the RP switch…
<br><br>
Now I don't smile readily, as anyone that knows me will tell you.  But I smiled when I read that.  Thanks Brad, for understanding.  I had to tell him that I had, indeed, forgiven him for the evil that could have been the RP switch.  I know I wasn't looking when that forgiveness happened, or it wouldn't have.  I mean, how could I possibly forgive him for adding something to EverQuest that caused me to rant and rave like a lunatic?
<br><br>
Alright, I overreacted.  The switch seems to have been a ripple, not a tidal wave.  I've heard a few tales from people that say that the switch has helped them find other role-players, and that they are glad it's there.  I've heard somewhat fewer stories of people that have been confronted with the "I haven't got my switch on, so I don't have to role-play" thing.  Most importantly, it's not affected me one bit, except for the minor disappointment when I hear a character with a purple name say something like "Yo, what lvl r u?"  So I guess I have to admit that the role-playing switch wasn't a bad thing.  And I forgive Brad for allowing it.  <em>[Ed. - hmm… can I add editors notes to my own material?  Anyhow, I want to point out for the sarcastically impaired that this was a joke.  I know full well that nobody needs my forgiveness to get on with their lives and be productive and happy members of our society…]</em>
<br><br>
Once in a while at work I get a project that requires that I design something for a group of people to use.  Nothing on the scale of EverQuest, mind you, but bothersome enough.  I have some idea what it's like to be required to listen to as many people as I can, consider all of their ideas and opinions, and build something based on those ideas.  At the same time I have to keep in mind what will and won't work in the context in question.  Access just can't turn on the office coffeepot in the morning, no matter how useful that would be for the folks that will need to enter information into the database.  And, most of the time, I may be the only one there that actually knows that Access can't do that (or did I miss something in those classes I took?)
<br><br>
It's not an easy job, sorting good ideas from bad, practical from impossible from just-might-be-doable.  Imagine doing that on the scale of EverQuest.  Not only do they have to deal with all of the concepts that come up in-house (those must have be the most fun brainstorming sessions in the early days), but they get to deal with people like me too.  You know the type.  I know enough about games to have a ton of ideas (most of which are pretty stupid once someone reads them back to me).  I have access to the web (and in my case I also have access to a web site that a few people actually read).  And I have no fears about making my ideas and opinions heard.  And there are a lot of me out there.  If you're reading this, you're probably one too.  With a flood of ideas, commentary and rants rolling over them like the proverbial floodwaters, I am very impressed with what EverQuest is.
<br><br>
They've added things that I know have been suggested by players (including the RP switch…).  They've also discarded ideas that we've suggested.  And so far they've done a fantastic job of parsing the good suggestions from the bad.  Right now I can't think of a single player suggested idea that they have implemented that I've got a complaint about.  Adding a little something for warriors is an idea that I like.  Admittedly, most of the changes that have been implemented since beta that were suggested by the players were fairly minor.  But that's as it must be.  Sweeping changes aren't a great idea after release.
<br><br>
But I was also involved in the beta, back when sweeping ideas were fair game.  I know that they listened very carefully to the testers.  I know that they had a lot of ideas to sort out from us.  And they did it well there too.  The classes are balanced (really, they are, if you don't think so, then my opinion is that you haven't a clue what unbalanced means) and the system works.  I've some idea what balancing the magic system was like, at least from the outside, and I'm impressed that it worked out so well.  Sure, I've got some new spell ideas, things that I'd like to see changed (ShadowKnights shouldn't get pets, they should get slightly better drain spells…).  But maybe, just maybe, they've already thought of it.  Maybe, just maybe, my ideas would unbalance something that I'm not even aware of.  Maybe by taking away pets from shadowknights they would lose too much defensive ability (pets are mini-tanks, after all), or maybe it would reduce their damage dealing too much (even with the addition of drain spells), or maybe…  Heck, I can only start to imagine the depths of change that such a simple sounding thing could cause.  And I think I know the way the game works pretty well.
<br><br>
I think where I'm heading is this: Good work Brad.  You ignored me.  You heard what I said (I didn't know you read EQX anymore), and ignored it.  And you were right, I was wrong.  And if you know when I'm wrong, I'm willing to believe that you know when I'm right.  And that means that you can probably decipher most of the suggestions from the rest of us out there.  To me, that's probably the most important skill you guys could have, the ability to tell what works from what doesn't.
<br><br>
Now, when will we be able to write in Norrath?  You know, scrolls and books, things that we can pass around and use as plot devices and such.  I really want to have someone sell me a treatise written by Oghma on the ways of the ancient Dwarves.  And I really want to be able to write notes asking for help, or become someone's secret admirer, or be a courier for mail across Norrath.  I mean, how could such a great idea be wrong?
