  Uneasy Symbiosis</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several years ago, 
  when I first began to mud, only a few months went by before I realized that 
  the online world where I played was continually supported and enhanced by volunteers. 
  Even the owners and main creators of the mud who paid to run it online and make 
  it open and accessible to its players, were volunteers, building the world and 
  creating a platform, a place, where people who came to play could also contribute 
  to the community. Some players became coders, or worldbuilders themselves. Others 
  were invited to become god administrators, watching over the players, enforcing 
  the rules, helping with problems. I remember Bimble whose amazing talent was 
  quest creation -- from writing the plot to developing the quest and running 
  it. Yet other players prepared contests, wrote stories and poems, or even acted 
  as teachers (thank goodness for Noke and Tagad for their tintin++ lessons) and 
  mentors. The community was richly grown through the efforts of its members and 
  the time they volunteered to it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a way, I suppose, 
  it was inevitable that the online roleplay gaming environments would initially 
  feel comfortable with and draw heavily from rpg volunteers. The Internet itself 
  blossomed with donated time and energy -- freeware, cheap shareware -- people 
  teaching others how to use the tools, people sharing their knowledge with those 
  they encountered, people encouraging and assisting others in developing yet 
  more permutations of game environments. Real life pen and paper roleplaying 
  games have also always relied on the efforts of volunteers for actual play. 
  A book full of descriptions of classes and races and spells and weapons is merely 
  paper with illustrations and lists. It is only when the GM develops the campaign 
  and players flesh out their characters, all volunteering their time to each 
  other, that the game lives and is played out. Thus, it seems an ethic of volunteer 
  energy has naturally evolved from both the efforts of players in the online 
  environment and the roleplaying communities in real life. From the first pen 
  and paper games through the muds and mushes and on to the graphical online rpgs, 
  the games themselves have grown beyond the boundaries of their initial play 
  structures to become platforms or stages on which the players often revise the 
  scenery and costumes, write the scripts and songs and enact the plays -- all 
  as volunteers whether a game itself is free or for a fee. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until the emergence 
  of the pay-to-play games, however, most issues involving volunteer recognition 
  and ownership of creative product were relatively uncomplicated. If a mud was 
  built using open source code and well-known literary worlds, for instance the 
  Diku mud code and a Forgotten Realms environment, the creators needed to be 
  sure to give acknowledgement to the mud code developers and needed to follow 
  approved guidelines from the owners of the Forgotten Realms copyright but few 
  other issues of ownership arose with only the most egregious of copyright violations 
  bringing desist letters. As their worlds grew and became perceptibly unique, 
  some mud creators did go on to try to establish ownership of this combination 
  of borrowed material and personal and volunteer additions and enhancements. 
  Some encrypted their code, requiring non-disclosure agreements from their volunteer 
  coders, and some claimed that anything published on the site of the mud (or 
  mush for that matter) was covered by an umbrella copyright and owned by the 
  mud creators. Other games, however, maintained open code and open use (while 
  most often maintaining a copyright), allowing anyone to use what they had developed 
  as long as credit was given. Money, however, rarely changed hands and the volunteers 
  didn&#146;t see the mud owners as financially benefiting from their labor in 
  these cooperative efforts. So, despite the occasional disputes over ownership 
  and copyright, the volunteer ethic was solid, trusted and respected and ownership 
  for profit was rarely an issue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pay-to-play 
  games that first came out seemed to simply layer this established volunteer 
  ethic and energy on top of their gameplay structures. The Realms, for example, 
  like many games, used volunteers to help run the game and assist players just 
  as the free muds did. Probably none of the games came into existence without 
  the efforts of volunteers, from testers to those who have offered all kinds 
  of creative input on game development, storylines and entertainment additions 
  such as contests, quests and fan sites. It was a natural assumption of game 
  developers and the player community alike that the offerings of the testers 
  and players were for both the benefit of the community and the profitability 
  of the company. Thus the not-for-profit models of volunteer involvement continued 
  to be used to build flourishing and creative games even when a company would 
  financially benefit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EverQuest certainly, 
  and from what I have heard, Asheron&#146;s Call and UO too, have all availed 
  themselves of the energies released by this volunteer ethic. From the input 
  of the earliest beta testers through the continuing suggestions of players of 
  today, for instance, the producers of EQ have relied heavily on volunteers to 
  help flesh out the world and the classes, test the spells and weapons and suggest 
  and help develop the more social/less technical elements of the game. I remember 
  even, way back in beta one, wandering the road with a game developer asking 
  me, Nep, how I imagined bards, what I thought they should be able to do and 
  how I could imagine playing one, all at a time when the guildmaster at the bard&#146;s 
  guild hadn&#146;t even learned how to sing yet, much less strum a lute. My experience 
  with this opportunity to provide ideas and suggestions certainly wasn&#146;t 
  unusual. Thousands of testers and players volunteered their time, the use of 
  their own equipment, their ideas and their detailed examination of gameplay 
  to help make EverQuest what it is today. Of course, all that effort wasn&#146;t 
  entirely altruistic -- I mean, the testers and players do get to play and be 
  part of an eagerly sought growing community. Regardless of the motives for donating 
  time and energy, however, and given the platform of the game provided by EverQuest 
  which rests solidly on a foundational ethic of including this volunteer energy, 
  the testers and players have been able to develop and present thousands of ideas 
  (superb through quite dreadful) to enrich the world of Norrath and build a connective 
  web of ongoing player/volunteer enhancements and improvements.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So far then, this 
  symbiosis of the volunteer ethic and for-profit game development seems to mutual 
  benefit. Thousands of players have a world to which they can contribute their 
  talents and skills and the game companies are profitable enough to ensure that 
  these imaginal world platforms will survive for the enjoyment and benefit of 
  the players as well as the stockholders. However, along with such profitability 
  often come those who neither develop a game directly nor enrich it for free. 
  While some may describe the newcomers as dark shadows of suits lurking in the 
  boardroom (although others may be more charitable), it seems to me that this 
  business/financial/legal intrusion raises several questions about the longterm 
  effect of financial issues on the thus far fruitful and creative volunteer presence. 
  Will the mesh of volunteer ethic and for-profit focus continue to hold? Will 
  the increasing profitability of on-lines games create battles over ownership 
  of ideas and recognition or recompense for volunteer donations? Will legal disputes 
  arise that will tear apart this increasingly uneasy partnership of capital and 
  volunteers?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is, already, 
  a court case of volunteer online chat helpers suing AOL. It is practically inevitable 
  that some day a story line written by a player and adapted and used by an online 
  rpg will end up in litigation over copyright. And what about the use of volunteer 
  beta testers, a vital resource needed especially by start-up companies? Will 
  they be seen as volunteers or will they eventually be perceived as free and 
  illegal workers? Will volunteer gods and guides blow down before the legal onslaught 
  of the winds of financial responsibility and taxation? There is even the possibility 
  of questions of ownership of a character. What if, for instance, a character 
  became so well known in a virtual world that it became a living part of the 
  environment that players talked about and wrote stories about? And then, what 
  if a scriptwriter came along and said, &#147;Wow, cool character and cool story 
  - I&#146;m going to write it up and sell it.&#148; Would the ensuing disputes 
  eventually destroy the very heart of the volunteer efforts?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Already, I&#146;m 
  sure, corporate meetings are fraught with warnings from the legal teams, and 
  already volunteers have begun to question whether their offerings are recognized 
  as being a true and unique portion of the development of the game worlds or 
  whether their ideas are ploughed and exploited by game corporations for additional 
  profit without recognition or reward for those volunteering. The Internet has 
  fostered practices of free and open speech and expectations of involvement. 
  Will there be a balance between what people want to give and what companies 
  may safely take? Will new ways of recognition and appreciation arise that will 
  satisfy both sides and maintain the partnership between the player communities 
  and the game developers?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is going to 
  be one of those slightly messy essays that end in a slew of questions and a 
  paucity of answers. It would be a great pity to close off the creative platforms 
  of online games from the volunteers, leaving players few, if any, places to 
  share their skills and talents and leaving them little way of benefiting themselves 
  and their fellow players. It would also be a grave pity to place such heavy 
  liability and tax burdens on the game companies that the volunteer ethic and 
  presence would be severely suppressed leaving the game with only a small and 
  probably way overworked contingent of helpers unable to replace the thousands 
  of human hours that had so freely enhanced the game for all of its players. 
  Is it possible to have a for-profit site that operates to both foster and use 
  the fruitfulness of the creativity of its players in a cooperative way that 
  is perceived as beneficial to all? I hope so.</font></p>
