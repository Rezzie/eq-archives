A sliver of light slid across the night sky.  Phinehas smiled wryly as the star
winked out of existence.  Funny thing about omens – one could never figure out
whether they bode good or ill.  Nevertheless, he could not shake the feeling that
his entire life revolved around the events of this particular night.  If recent
experience was any indication, he didn’t think his premonition too far-fetched.

Phinehas reached into the small scrip at his side, slung crossways around his neck
by a thin leather strap, and fingered the rough parchment that was its only
occupant.  He shivered and hurried along the narrow street, moving further into the
shadows to avoid the light cast from nearby windows.  It was only a crude drawing
that he had hastily sketched with a piece of charcoal, but… <em>the Cross of Elwin</em>.  He
shook his head in wonder.  The sage had seemed certain.  <em>If Durgon or his knaves even
suspected…</em>  He left the thought unfinished.

 Portents aside, his best hope was to return to his room at the <em>Hind’s Foot</em>, retrieve
 the priceless artifact and catch the first ship for Freeport before the sage started
 wagging his tongue.  Phinehas knew that, in spite of the carefully crafted tale he
 had spun about finding the drawing buried in the dusty boxes that passed for the
 library of a shrine just outside of <em>Haggada</em>, the sage had been suspicious.  He had
 stuck with the truth for the most part when relating his discovery of the cross,
 only omitting his discovery of the actual artifact wrapped in the large piece of
 parchment he now carried in his scrip.  Experience proved that the best fiction was
 based mostly on fact.  He frowned as he reminded himself again that his visit with
 the sage had been a necessary risk.
