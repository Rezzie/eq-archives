<p align="justify">Welcome to Issue 5.  Kit is still in limbo someplace.  I hope he didn't get lost.  :)
<br><br>
First let me welcome a new member of the EQX crew, Malaclypse.  She tells me that we might be hearing a lot from 
her in the near future.  I'm looking forward to it.
<br><br>
I also wanted to appologize for the lack of content this issue in the 
Tales section.  As you all know the closed beta is not out yet.  That makes it somewhat difficult to 
produce interesting stories about EverQuest.  But we will not give up our efforts.  And if 
any of our readers wants to submit something, please do!
<br>
<br>
Well, please enjoy this issue of EQX!
