        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
          There has been a crime perpetrated against the artistic community this 
          week. I am speaking, of course, about the incident where a player was 
          banned from EQ for fiction written to one of the fan message boards.<br>
          Guilt and poor judgement were in abundance this week. No surprise there. 
          As usual, and as is appropriate, it&#146;s impossible to get the entire 
          story. Verant does not publicize details of their dealings with individuals, 
          and in my opinion, that&#146;s good policy, as long as they hold the 
          proper communications with the person actually involved. </font></p>

            far away, even though both had been here in the shadows of the lavastorm

            as she had for hours, staring in disbelief at what she had just heard 
            her companion say. The battle-hardened Sister of the Indigo towered 
            over the frail necromancer, with a gaze nearly as gloomy as the news 
            she had brought. </font></p>

              I stated in my last article, I have had lots of surfing time but

              reading that revolves around literature and writing, there was an 
              exercise going on which so funny that I couldn&#146;t resist joining 
              in at the first opportunity. The exercise was to warp a scene from 
              Star Wars to appear as if it had been written by one of your favorite 
              authors. I choose to write a scene from Stars Wars based off of 
              Robert Jordan. Here&#146;s a copy of the post:</font></p>

          I started this essay writing in character as Nepenthia, it&#146;s quite 
          likely I&#146;d describe her as frequenting an inn in Freeport, or searching 
          for scrolls about Tunare, or perhaps even (as set out last week in that 
          rather silly poem about dresses) as initiating a quest to marry Aradune. 
          It would seem entirely natural to place Nep in Norrath, using the possibilities 
          of that huge and fascinating world for her stories because that is where 
          Nep now spends her time, meets her friends and experiences adventures. 
          Even though Nep wasn&#146;t born in Norrath, the place of her birth 
          actually having been a ship that sailed far, far away and long, long 
          ago, she has traveled through a variety of realms on her way there.
