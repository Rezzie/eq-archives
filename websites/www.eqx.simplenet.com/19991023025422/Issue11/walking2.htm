	<big><big>T</big></big>he booming sound of thunder overhead let him know that a storm was coming,
	but the flash of light a few yards to right let him know that it was close.
	Very close.  Indreju cursed at the torrential rain that immediately followed,
	counting his luck even worse for a night that had already gone bad.  His pursuers
	had yet to leave him; mounting horses themselves, and now if he managed to escape
	these men he would need to sleep outside in this rain.
<br><br>
	Slowly he was managing to gain more distance because his pursuers had had too much
	to drink this night, but surely they knew the area around their home town better
	drunk then he did sober.  To top it all off, he must return and for his crystal
	figurine of Fennin Ro.  He could not risk loosing his new abilities just after he
	gained them.  To be the first Elven Paladin in all of known history had not been an
	easy task, and he vowed not to let a group of drunkards get him in a bad standing with
	his god.  While contemplating how on Norrath he was going to get back into the
	Wayward Traveler to get his figure, he realized that he had not paid enough
	attention to where he was going, and was lost in a small clearing.

  Looking up would do him no good, the heavy clouds prevented him from seeing the
	stars, and the rain kept his sight to a very limited range, even for an elf.
	Another deafening thunderclap overhead made it so that he did not hear his
	pursuers on the other side of the trees, and a small group broke out.  There were
	only three of them, and they were drunk, but he did not want to give the others a
	chance to find them and help. They all drew a weapon of some sort, one had a mace,
	another an axe, and the third a sword.  They did not wait for a formal introduction
	as two of them moved off to the sides to try to get at Indreju from three different
	angles.  Resigning himself to a fight, he drew out his long sword, and made a
	prayer to his god Fennin Ro.
	<br><br>  
	Trying to decide if it was better to try to flee on horseback, or get down so he
	could fight, he had a strange feeling to close his eyes.  Just after closing them,
	lightning struck the ground all around.  From the screams coming from his left and
	right, and the smell of burnt flesh, Indreju knew that two of his combatants had
	died to the hands of lightning.  He opened his eyes to see the third attacker, the
	one with the sword, was rubbing his eyes to try getting his vision back.  He spurred
	his horse forward, past the attacker, and slapped the swordsman’s horse on the rump
	to get it to move.

	Taking advantage of his newfound luck, Indreju ran his horse past another group of
	attackers, back towards town.  If the storm would only hold up, he might just be
	able to get back to the Inn and get his figure of Fennin Ro tonight.
	<br><br>
	With the help of the wild storm that was throwing lightning bolts out of the sky
	every few seconds, he managed to make it back to the Inn with only one other minor
	incident.  Coming around to the front of the inn he leapt off his horse and crashed
	through the front doors.
	<br><br>
	"Sir you can’t bring your sword into my Inn!"  Screamed the innkeeper, as he
	started to come out from behind the bar.
	<br><br>
	Indreju drew his sword and turned on the man; "I shall wear this sword where I
	choose!  I let you take it off of me, to find that you do not keep your Inn’s rules
	consistent with all of your customers.  Besides I only came to retrieve something
	of mine."  Either from the fire in his eyes, or the sharp ringing of the steel
	coming free of it’s scabbard, the innkeeper backed down.
