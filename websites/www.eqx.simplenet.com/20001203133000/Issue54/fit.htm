NERIAK FOREIGN QUARTER
<br><br>
Cynically describing themselves as "ambassador's of Teir'Dal goodwill" a group known as the F'leurs DuMal ripped through the Foreign Quarter yesterday, enslaving several human and erudite visitors, and destroying a new merchant shop run by humans.  As flames licked up the walls of the shop, spokesman and infamous poet and shadowknight T'daven H'yonith stated, "Neriak has begun to stink of the lesser animals.  Let all know that they are no longer welcome here." Unverified was the rumor that the human vendor had tried to sell the group brandy at inflated prices.

AND IN BUTCHERBLOCK
<br><br>
Mr. and Mrs. Nosebone, survivors of their goblin son Pik, wish to announce a viewing at 9:00 am Sunday, with the funeral following at 10:00 am.  Those wishing to give gifts should make donations to the "Halt Dwarf Agression" campaign at the Chief's hut.
