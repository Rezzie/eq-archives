<center><big><b>My Forth of July Vacation</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
My wife had planned out a wonderful vacation over the Fourth of July weekend.  She decided to take me to a town in Pennsylvania where her father had grown up, a town where no one has any secrets and everyone knows everyone.  This was a town in which no household has an air-conditioner, no Worlds Gym to workout in for a week.   This is a place where everyone in the town gets together on Friday night and gathers at the American Legion to play bingo and other card games.   I mean EVERYONE goes.  It was like being trapped in a bad episode of The Andy Griffith Show.  I found myself whistling that tune several times during the trip.
<br><br>
My wife didn't know it but I had hid my laptop in the tons of luggage she had packed for the trip. 
<br><br>
After a seven hour road trip we arrived at her aunt's house.  About two hours had passed and all the greetings were over.   I left the room and dug out my laptop, and played a little StarCraft.  My wife came into the room.  "Just what do you think your doing?"
<br><br>
"Huh?" I answered, not wanting to break my TCF (you remember my earlier article about Total Concentration Factor right?).
<br><br>
"I can't believe you're in here playing on your computer.  Part of the reason I took you on this trip was to get you away from your computer."
<br><br>
I then made mistake number one.
<br><br>
"Well you failed then didn't you."  I said with a half grin half laugh.
<br><br>
She stormed out of the room.  Damn I thought to myself, and then continued to finish the level I was playing and turned the laptop off.  I wanted to be able to sleep that night on a comfortable bed, and not some lumpy couch. 
<br><br>
I walked back into the kitchen where the group of Mayberryittes were talking about anything from the weather to feeding farm animals.  I sat and listened, bored to tears, occasionally shooting smiles in my wife's direction to assure her I was having a great time!
<br><br>
At about eleven o'clock I was relived of my punishment.  My wife suggested we go to bed.  Day one was over.  She was getting the bed ready, and started to talk about the upcoming "day two" events.  "Tomorrow we are going to travel to "Some stupid Creek" for a canoe trip.  Wont that been fun?"  She said, her face full of excitement.
<br><br>
"Oh my, I'm full of joy honey." I relied.
<br><br>
"You had a good time tonight admit it."  She said as she continued to ready the bed.
<br><br>
I didn't know how to answer that question without incriminating myself, so I didn't.
<br><br>
"You mean to tell me you'd have rather played on that laptop than visit with my family?"
<br><br>
"Of course not." I lied.
<br><br>
"Your unbelievable." She said, paused, looked at me sternly and added, " I have this strange feeling your going to ruin this trip."
<br><br>
Then I made mistake number two.
<br><br>
"Then why did you bring me?" I asked.
<br><br>
She shot me a look, appearing more like a Zerg than my wife and said, "Why don't you sleep downstairs on the couch." And she tossed me a pillow.  "Maybe you'll have more fun there!"
<br><br>
Tossing and turning all night on a couch isn't exactly what I would call a good night sleep.  I think I got about four hours of rest before the sounds of Mayberry coming to life, floated into the window.  It was my early five a.m. wakeup call.
<br><br>
I rolled out of my bed and walked into the kitchen.  Two of the Mayberryittes are drinking coffee, and talking about who was going to feed the farm animals.  I grabbed a cup of coffee and tried to wakeup.  At that moment my wife walked into the kitchen.  "Have a wonderful sleep honey?" She snickered.
<br><br>
"Yea great." I mumbled.  I took a drink of my coffee and burned my tongue.
<br><br>
"I told Auntie you would help them with the livestock so we can get an early start on the canoe trip.  I figured you would like that." Another snicker.
<br><br>
Her uncle added "Oh great I get some help today from the big guy."
<br><br>
We headed up to the barn.  He instructed me how to feed the pigs.  I was to pour these buckets of crap into these long wooden things called troughs.  It was a stinky disgusting job let me tell you.   After about an hour and a half of work, we headed back to the house to get ready for the canoe trip.  I tried to shower off the farm smell from my skin without success.  I was already dead tired and really didn't want to go on this trip, which was supposed to last eight hours.
<br><br>
Well a lucky man has his fortune.   I got sick (from either smelling the pigs or eating Mayberry food) and told my wife I couldn't make the trip.  I'm sure she didn't believe me but for some strange reason she let me stay at the house.  I don't think it was out of generosity.  I think she was more worried that I would ruin the trip.  I'll admit I would not have been much fun.  Canoeing in a creek bed does nothing for me.  Now give me some white water rafting, and I'll show you some fun.
<br><br>
So here I am.  Still in "Day Two".  Its like two thirty and they are still gone.  Its pouring down rain out there (laughter), and I'm sitting here writing this story and watching a Star Trek marathon.  I don't have to go to work and I'm resting my tired bones.  Now that's what I call a vacation!
<br><br>
Happy Fourth of July, everyone.  Be safe and don't drink and drive.
