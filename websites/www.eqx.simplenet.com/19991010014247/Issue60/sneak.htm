The unusually quiet night did not bode well for our plans.  Every step the three of us took seemed to announce our movements across the plains spread out in the darkness ahead us.  
<br><br>
	"How much are we getting paid for this?" I whispered over my left shoulder to the half-elf and barbarian that crouched there.  I winced, the sound of my voice was too sharp, too high and too loud.
	<br><br>
The barbarian shushed me with a wave of his huge hand and a low grunt.  A great stack of a man, tall as a grizzly, he was clothed in bear hide armor made by his own hand.  Looking at him hunkered down there behind a spindly pine that afforded him no camouflage, I realized how much he did look like a great grizzly in search of a meal.  I'm afraid of very little (or so I like to think, though I know I have much to see of the world yet, as young as I am), but to face this man as a foe would quail even my fool's courage.  He was not merely a solid combatant, but also a practiced wielder of the shamanic mysticism of his people.  His name was Jildaen, and we were fast becoming good friends.
<br><br>
	Baerdon was my other companion.  Very different from Jildaen physically, Baerdon had the mixed blood of elves and humans in him.  He exhibited the finer traits of both of the races.  Slightly shorter than I, he moved with the sharpness and precision of a knife that was undoubtedly a skill he learned from the stage.  I thought it unusual that a bard would take a job such as this.  His charismatic and attractive presence lent itself more fittingly to a place among kings and entertainers than out here this night with the prairie dogs and beetles.  But Baerdon was no stranger here.  He knew the land and led us confidently toward our goal.
<br><br>
"The camp is just ahead, there, in the distance," he whispered, much quieter than I had.  Jildaen and I peered into the blackness across the plain ahead.  We could see nothing more than a bright pinprick of the bandit's campfire at this range.  "There are three," he continued, his half-elven eyes a marvel of accuracy.  "All three are human I believe.  I doubt they could spot our approach.  Let's move closer."
<br><br>
We had been relatively hidden in the line of pines, but now we moved out of safety into the openness of the plains.  I felt suddenly like a great blundering mammoth.  They don't teach wizards how to sneak around in the schools in Erudin.  I grabbed up my robe in a bunch in one hand and crept forward after Baerdon, Jildaen following me.  Jildaen was certainly good at this; even in daylight I would have dismissed him as an animal.  I was completely out of my element.  I wiped the sweat from my palms on my robe.
<br><br>
	We were close enough that I could hear the bandits talking now.  One of the two still awake was taking guard duty; the other was going to sleep.  The druid had been a tough kill, the bandit lying down was saying, and he was bushed.  
<br><br>
If there's one skill I do have, it is a good sense of hearing.  
<br><br>
I still wanted to know how much we were being paid for this job.  Baerdon had recruited us.  Hired by an official in Qeynos, as he had explained earlier, he was to deal with the worsening problem of highwaymen in this area.  However, the problem had a darker root; there were rumors of bribes.  The stories of guards turning a blind eye to attacks on innocent travelers were becoming commonplace.  No one was sure how far up the corruption went, the official had told Baerdon.  The bribery would be addressed, but the bandits must be dealt with immediately.
	<br><br>
Baerdon signaled me.  Now, it was my job to try and attract a single bandit away from the camp, far enough that we could strike him down before the other two could assist.  We were sure we could deal with the remaining two in turn.  A simple cantrip should do the trick.  I inched closer then lay flat on the ground, and waited until the breathing of the two sleeping men became steady with sleep.
<br><br>
The cantrip did not require any verbal components; it was very simple as I said.  I wove the sound of a rustling in underbrush a good fifteen feet to my left and behind.  It wasn't the most authentic rustling sound I had ever created with the spell, but I wasn't trying to pass a casting test for my old master.  It would suffice.  I watched with a satisfied smile the bandit on guard perk up immediately and stare out toward the sound.  It was working.  My heart hammered so hard, I knew I would find a dent in the earth beneath me when I moved.  I tried to steady my breathing.  The guard stood and peered more intently into the night.  <em>Come on</em>, I thought as if to urge him mentally to take the next action and step out from the safety of the light of their campfire.  I turned my head to see if I could catch a glimpse of Jildaen.
<br><br>
What happened next occurred much too fast.
<br><br>
	"Glaern!" the guy on watch said sharply.  "Glaern, get up.  I need your eyes."  I heard both sleeping men stir then sit up immediately.
<br><br>
	"What is it?"
<br><br>
	"Something… Not an animal.  I can't see though.  Can you see anything out there?"
<br><br>
	At that moment I knew my heart was going to pound a hole straight to the Underfoot.  I was frozen to my spot.  Glaern had infravision.
<br><br>
	I turned my head back toward the camp in time to see all three shapes rushing straight for me.  I tried to stand, but tripped and fell on the hem of my robe.  Mental note:  stealth and wizard's robes do not mix.  I sucked a nose full of dust as I gasped.  A boot lodged itself in my side and fully flipped me onto my back.  For a moment I felt like a turtle and could do nothing but hold my hands up in defense.  All three bandits were on me.
<br><br>
	Suddenly there was a roar, like that of an animal, from somewhere, and one of the bandits pitched forward, slammed up and over me.  The hulking form of Jildaen sailed through the air on the back of the bandit.  They crashed into the ground, the bandit crushed beneath Jildaen.  For an instant the other two bandits were startled.  I took the opportunity and sprang to my feet.
<br><br>
	Their momentary shock passed quickly and I was hit with a blade.  The eldritch shield surrounding me flared a dull green for an instant and took the brunt of the stab.  At the same time I caught an elbow right in the face from the other.  I reeled, and for a moment, I could not see.
<br><br>
	Things were just not going well at all.  I stumbled into a blind run.
<br><br>
	At that moment, I heard music.  It's strange the things you think you see and hear when you're being murdered.  But I wasn't hearing things; the music was coming from nearby.  Baerdon was singing a battle song.  His voice possessed a richness and power that rang of war drums and knights, with a chorus like the rolling thunder of a cavalry.  Amazingly I felt my muscles swell and my legs begin pumping faster than they ever have.
<br><br>
Between lyrics, Baerdon shouted, "Run!"  I wasn't sure if the bandits were still behind me, but I was not about to leave my companions to die.  I remembered a trick I used on a lion once, near this very area.  Not a trick really, just a common sense use of the skills I had been taught.  I had been traveling back to Qeynos, when the lion attacked me while I rested beneath a tree off the road.  There was no chance of me outrunning the animal, and no chance of me killing it.  So, I turned to face it, calling to mind the spell I needed.  It was a relatively quick cast, and it caused the lion's paws to become bound to the earth.  I had lived that day.
<br><br>
	I ran as hard as I could and put what I figured would be a fair distance between myself and my pursuers, with the help of Baerdon's song.  I stopped abruptly, and pivoted to face the bandits.
<br><br>
	There was no one behind me.  I could not see Jildaen or Baerdon.  All around me was darkness.  I thought I could still hear Baerdon's song, but the blood pounding through my ears made it impossible to tell.  The Bandits had broken off their chase, and were after the others.  Or so I had thought.
<br><br>
	I leaned a moment against a pine tree to catch my breath, then took a step back toward the direction of the camp.  My magical shield flared its dull green again, but this time it was of little defense from behind.  My shoulder blade broke like a crust of dry bread beneath the bandit's dagger.  The other man struck the side of my head with his fist.  It felt like a hammer, and my head ricocheted against the trunk of the pine.  Blood filled my eyes.  I felt my mortality then, like a feather bed, inviting me to rest, finally.  
<br><br>
	But I would not.  Though the mages training on Erudin had not taught me how to skulk about in the dark very well, it had taught me how to master pain and think clearly, particularly under extreme circumstances like this one.  I hadn't a moment.  They would strike again in an instant, and that would surely doom me.
<br><br>
	I whirled quickly, wiping blood from one eye with my right hand, and beginning the weave of the spell with my left.  The pain of lifting my arm and grinding my shattered shoulder blade nearly broke my concentration.  Through my cleared eye I marked my target in front of me.  Light sprung from around me, and I drew energy to a point in the palm of my hand.  I flung out my left hand in an arc at the attacker I could see.  He lurched and fell off balance as his leather boots stuck to the ground.
<br><br>
	Again, I whirled, in hopes of finding my other assailant, the one with the weapon.  In doing so, I dodged his next jab.  He lunged past me, and I took off toward, what I hoped, was the direction of the road.  
<br><br>
	I heard the music again.  Baerdon was closing with me, and once more my legs lightened.  The pain in my shoulder dulled, and I swear I felt the very flesh of my shoulder begin knitting itself together as I ran.  With renewed strength, I filled my lungs and shouted into the darkness Jildaen's name.  In response, a blue haze surrounded me.  The wound in my shoulder closed completely with the shaman's spell.  
<br><br>
	"Run, Menoch, you fool!" Jildaen bellowed from somewhere.  My eyes were filled with blood again, and though I wiped at them repeatedly, I still could not see.
<br><br>
	"Left!"  Baerdon's command came out as a perfectly sensible lyric in the song he was singing, but I knew it was meant for me.  I was running in the wrong direction.  
<br><br>
	I twisted around, and again wiped at my eye.  I caught sight of Baerdon.  I veered toward him, then lost sight under a gush of blood.  The gash in my forehead was deep and tore up into my scalp.  In a moment though, I felt the hard packed earth of the road beneath my steps.
<br><br>
	Baerdon's lyrics told the story of travelers, merchants who traveled safely and quickly along good roads, wizards whose spells carried them aloft with grace and speed, and plainsmen upon mighty horses.  I could hardly feel the weight of my body on my legs, and they moved as if they ran for themselves alone.  We were well into the area under the control of Qeynos now, and out of danger.  At least I hoped.  This part of the road was patrolled often by the town guards.
<br><br>
	But then, there were the rumors.
<br><br>
	"I think we're safe," said Baerdon, who handed me a cloth when we stopped.  I dabbed at my face with it.  It was a very nice cloth, and I looked up at him.  "A gift from the sheriff of Rivervale," he said.  I looked apologetically at him.  It was ruined with blood and dirt.  "It's okay," he answered.  "He gave me a whole set."  Baerdon smiled.
<br><br>	
Jildaen was not among us, however.  We were reasonably certain the bandits had called off their pursuit.  Jildaen was tough, and we were equally certain he had escaped as well.  After a brief rest, we turned back out towards the plains to find our friend.
