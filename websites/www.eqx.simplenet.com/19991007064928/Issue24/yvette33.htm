The cries of the lone sailor thrashing in the water were muffled by the
sounds of the ocean and the noisy pirate crew. The five of them had snuck onto
the deck and hid at the rear of the ship behind the boxes. They whispered to
each other as to what they could do to retake control of the ship without
destroying it or the box. Never before had such a rushed argument about
battle tactics passed the lips of any of the participants save one, the
older man, who's name turned out to be Morgan.

Yvette could only hear the sounds of the man in the water, and heard none of
the argument. She stared out through the gap in the railing at the sailor who
was swimming back to the ship with what looked like his last ounce of
strength. She recognized him as the larger of the cargo crew men, she smiled

his for a short moment, and a final sound came from him before he sunk
beneath the surface, thrashing for a moment.

She reached out for him, tears flowing from her cheeks. Her lips moved as she
sent a prayer for his soul, and then she began to cast her spell.

Montgomery gently nudged her, asking if she was ready to attack the pirate
group, but she continued to stare out at the black sea, crying silently to
herself. Montgomery shrugged and murmured to the others "she must not have
been as ready for this conflict as she made up to be, she is lost to us."
The others then gave a two-count before moving for the attack.
