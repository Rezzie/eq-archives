<big><big>A</big></big>s time and EverQuest progresses, many gamers have become afflicted with a mysterious ailment known as "EverRage".  Considered similar to Road Rage, EverRage seems to be contracted by many easily stressed gamers eagerly anticipating the closed beta of EverQuest.  Many of these gamers, remembering the 6-odd-hour window for sign-ups for the <a href="http://www.trilance.com">Trilance's</a> closed beta, frantically check <a href="http://www.everquest.com">www.EverQuest.com</a> many times daily to see if the closed beta's sign-ups are open.   Now, closed beta was announced to be open "soon" every since... at least November.  Three months of this behavior have caused many gamers, even hardened veterans of this phenomenon, to go in to a state of EverRage.

One woman was seen approaching the EverQuest Team's San Diego headquarters holding a protest sign on high and chanting "Stop dragon discrimination in Everquest!  Stop dragon discrimination in EverQuest!  The EQ Team is Dragonist! (Except maybe that Bill Trost... he's kind of cute)".  The EQ team immediately went into a state of panic; most were convinced that Satan had arrived to stop their holy mission to better online multiplayer gaming everywhere.  Mike Hutchins even tried to feed livestock to the EverRage afflicted gamer.  The sheep and cows were promptly devoured and the gamer kept on coming.  Bill fled to the EQ team's fallout shelter, and was heard muttering "not _again_..." under his breath as he sprinted through the halls.  Rosie Cosgrove tried to sick the team's guards dogs, fifi and Veeshan on the gamer, but instead they chased ^..^ out from behind a nearby fern where he was hiding in hopes of get the latest on EverQuest for EQX.

Luckily, Brad knew what to do.  Before the woman could attempt entry into the building, Brad assumed a safe position at a window, and pulling out his trusty cigarette lighter, and hurled it at the gamer. The lighter flashed and exploded into a spectacular particle effect that slayed the EverRaged gamer instantly.   She was later identified as the notorious B.S.G., known better online as Bloodly Stumps.

You could write EverQuest stories, make up backgrounds for the characters you'll play in the game.   Join an EverQuest shared story group, a la <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/fowles/15/running.htm" target>^..^ 's page</a>.  Even write articles for EQX.  Control your EverRage, and pray for the Closed Beta app to open up, or at least a definite date.
