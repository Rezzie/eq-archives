The High Men are rumored to be one of the brightest races in all the lands of Norrath.  
Have you ever wondered what their city looks like?  Well, we have a shot of that city, 
and it includes their most precious building.

As is our custom here at EverQuest Express, we want to see what stories crop
up based on our newest EverQuest <a href="../Issue42/eqxclusiv2.htm">screen shot</a>.
Those of us at EQX will be writing some, but we also want to hear your stories.
So take your inspiration from the screen shot and write a story about it, then
send that story to us.  We'll be publishing the good ones in our next issue.
If you want to read the tales that were written last time, follow these links:
<a href="../Issue17/shotstory.htm">Staff stories</a> based on our last screen shot, and <a href="../Issue20/shotstory2.htm">Staff and Reader tales</a> based on a shot taken from the Official EverQuest site.
<br><br>
Our 46th Issue will be coming out on October 31st.
<font color="#ff6600"><b>HALLOWEEN!</b></font>  So we have decided to dedicate
that issue to tales of horror from Norrath.  If you have any terrifying stories
to tell, articles about the dead, or any artwork 
suitable to frighten, send them in!

Rale shivered as something dry and rough slid across his face.  He opened his eyes, straining to focus through a shadowy haze.  He was lying on his back, at least he thought he was.  His blurred vision gave no clue as to his orientation.  He squinted and tried to lean forward.  Instantly, he fell back, his motions accompanied	by a familiar rustling sound.  The sound of dry leaves.  With a grunt he rolled onto his side and again forced his eyes open to examine his surroundings.  He was lying on the floor of the royal antechamber.  All around him, the floor was covered in a blanket of broad Wildwood leaves.  The pile continued to grow as the leaves fell almost eagerly from the tree.  The tree itself seemed beyond old now.  It look nearly hollow and brittle to the touch; nothing like the vibrant life that had sprung from it earlier at Galarin's command.  He started to reach out to it.  He had felt its life with his druidic powers when Galarin had first cast the spell.  Now it was cold and lifeless.  No, not quite dead but wasting away from the inside.  He shuddered and scanned the room.

   "Honey come watch this.   I can't believe this.  I FINISHED it!" my wife screamed at me from the downstairs computer room.

I ran down the stairs to see what all the excitement was.

EQ evolution begins before the open beta begins.
<br><br>
Recently there was notification that the original EQ newsgroup "Forum.Everquest" which was maintained by AVAULT would be shut down.  There was an Eleventh-hour reprieve and the group brought back.  Mind you, everyone who used to frequent it has made a new home elsewhere (More commonly in alt.games.everquest).  An act of God spared the group, but it didn't bring back the teething masses yearning to play.

Bulgar reached for the nearest clover sapling and pulled himself up the steep hill.  His large legs were growing painfully tired and he considered resting before he approached the top.  Bulgar realized that ten years ago this climb would have been much easier, but now his body was beginning to feel each aching step.  After a quick glance upward, Bulgar knew that he was almost there and continued with renewed progress.  With no other vegetation in sight, he continued at a severe slouch to balance his weight up the arduous hillside.  Bulgar's legs alone couldn't carry the burden so he finished the last few feet in a crawling position.

Well, this week we certainly did get to see a lot of new screen shots.  It seems
that all of the bigger fan sites were included in the frenzy.  We've now seen
shots of what look like lizard men, bee-Halflings, views of the Elven tree
city...  All sorts of stuff to whet our appetites.  Many of us are looking
forward to the chance to start a new adventure in Norrath.  And as the frenzy
heightens for new adventure in EverQuest, I notice that a lot of the fan sites
that I visited have gone away.  Plat dropped his a while ago, at least until
later.  EverQuest Extreme has ceased to update.  Valderen stopped updating over
a year ago.  I haven't even looked at my own page, Tales of Rose and Blade, in several months...

I really liked <a href="../Issue41/mig.htm">The Grassy Gnoll</a>.  Are there any more tales of Mig Hammerer?  If not, does Archanalia does plan on writing more?  Great story.  Please send my compliments to the author.

<em>Player driven events. GM's should definitely run RP events, but do
the players have a similar obligation to improve the whole community?
Should guilds in particular host such events?  Dare I even ask if this
should be a requirement for recognized guild standing in EQ?
