Soon the world of Norrath will be full of people who play.  Who adventure.  Who seek out excitement and unique accomplishment in a new realm of fantasy.  Why, then, would name choices include characters from Robert Jordan novels or from books by other au courant writers?  Why use anime idols, or even the names of well known mythological adventurers?  Not to mention names that are derivatives of a favorite wine or the name borne by a real life person.  Why not play when choosing a name?  Apply some imagination, some creativity, some humor and some sense of the persona of the character to be brought into the world.  Then mix up the ideas, let them stew a bit.  Think of honors to be earned and how the name chosen will ring in the ears of friends.  Find the name that fits.
<br><br>
It's not really that hard to play, even with names.  Take down the atlas, open a dictionary, find a reference book of word derivations.  You could even go to the web and find sites full of names and their meanings in many of the world's languages.  (Use a name generator in REAL desperation, but some of the fun will be missing.)    Parents have their crack at naming.  Some cultures even have naming ceremonies at the different stages of life.  But this is your chance to adventure into the world of naming a character.  Consider that this character with this name may go on for years, growing and changing, gaining fame or notoriety.  Does the name fit that which the character is fated to be and do?
<br><br>
A word of caution here:  there are some common patterns that may attract you.  Ignore them.  A siren may be singing a song of a) favorite brews as names; b) wildest sexual innuendoes as names; c) stupidest political scandals as names; and d) goriest disembowelments as names.  Earplugs against the sirens might be necessary here.  Wit is good, people may laugh.  They might even delight in knowing smiles among each other as they decipher the wit.  (There was a game once where words from foreign languages were not allowed as names.  Someone managed, despite these rules to have the name Rien approved.  After all, if the named desired isn't allowed, might as well have nothing for a name.)  Even the best humor and wit can cause a player to miss a great opportunity. Names carry a lot of energy; people react to them.  People respond to the connotations of a name.  Search for, adventure after, and play with the name that will end up best fitting the character, so that no one could ever imagine that character with a different name.
<br><br>
Some other things to consider:
<ol>
	<li>Real world vs fantasy world  -- should one intrude on the other?  Yes, the very best band just played the local theatre, but they didn't play Norrath.  Why include their name?
	<li>Class -- incorporating words that represent attributes of the class sometimes works, but why settle for Beethoven or Sonata, when a bard in Norrath can invent a new composer or a new musical form.  Also a druid probably would be kicked out of a guild with a name like Treesmasher.
	<li>Race -- pretty evident here.  The races are each rich with their own sounds and speech patterns.  How could an elf be saddled with the heaviness of a name like Chomptoes or a troll with lyrical roll of Stelliana.  Doesn't make sense.
	<li>Offensiveness -- Ok, mom's soap-in-the-mouth treatment of dirty words doesn't mean revenge here.  Names that offend realworld sensibilities, race, ethnicity, etc. don't belong.
	<li>Gender -- be prepared.  If you choose the name Hugmealotcausei'mcute  (ignoring all the foregoing suggestions about names), be ready for the responses that may come your way.
	<li>Typing  -- despite the advantages of names like xxitheleormszzasicl in a pkmud, the player in Norrath will enjoy certain advantages with a typeable name.   Choosing a 15 syllable name will probably evoke the following tell from a group mate:  "I tried to type RUN 8 times but I couldn't spell the name.  Need help with a corpse retrieval?"
</ol>

Does this leave every player with only the word "rutabaga" for a name choice?  No, it doesn't.
<br><br>
	Imagine an enormous bulging muscled barbarian.  First delete "Conan" and "Barbarella" from the word list.  Then imagine who the character is;  imagine the barbarian culture and religions and way of life.  Natural elements, animals, shamanistic practices.  Check word derivations of a favorite animal or element and play with its sounds and its spellings.  Play word games in your mind, taking words that seem almost right apart and putting them back together in new ways.  Use the sounds that seem to fit.  
<br><br>
That is not to say that characters have not been named after literary, historical or mythological beings to good effect.  But before naming, consider carefully whether a real life car named after a real life winter wind is the right choice.  Or, if a word from religious dogma is going to adequately convey personality?  Will the character named after a literary figure ever be able to establish a unique identity?  
<br><br>
With that, happy playday with names.  And in thinking about it, a halfling just might like the name Rutabaga.
