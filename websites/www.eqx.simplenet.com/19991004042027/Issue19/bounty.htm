First off, some background on the participants of this story (myself and
my roommate).  We both play the Realm currently and have been playing it
since it was 2.x.  Now the realm has a Pk switch that works like the one
EQ is supposedly going to have. It turns on by willingly choosing to
kill another player, or by picking someone's pocket.  It's pretty rough,
but it works to keep newbies relatively safe.  But originally there was
a bounty system that was supposed to go into effect so that the people
that felt they were wronged could place a bounty on someone. It was a
good thought but not a simple one to implement because what happens when
a bored superpowerfull player decides to randomly place bounties on
newbies "just for laughs". Those players would soon find themselves
being attacked by the NPC bounty hunters in the game (Funny, but not
right).

I bring this up because I was explaining to him some of the
things that drive people to PK when he says "Wouldn't it be cool if..."
and I noticed that dark gleam in his eyes I associate with an idea
"...if you could get like a scalp off a person you killed".  I looked at
him awhile, not sure if I heard that right and he continued. "Then you'd
have something to show for killing someone"  Quite disturbed by this I
jumped up and capered about with my arms out like I was displaying the
inside of my trenchcoat on a dark New York street corner and said "Hey
look, I've got 300 scalps everbody. Of course they're mostly newbies,
but look at 'em all"

Having seen my misinterpretation of what he was
trying to say he expanded on the idea of scalps.  "Maybe not for like
everyone, but you should get like a bounty and a trophy for killing
wanted people"  Not wanting to go into how to determine "wanted" with
him, I left the helpful thought as it was. I think that Pking is part of
the realism of the game, I don't think that naming your character
Charles Manson, or Jack T. R. and going around killing people you know
you can kill just to confirm that you can kill them is any fun when I'm
the person you kill. I could have my Pk switch on because I finally got
sick of the little 1st level theif following me around picking my
pockets and I finally killed him/her.  Well I've got some thoughts out
so I'll leave it at that.
