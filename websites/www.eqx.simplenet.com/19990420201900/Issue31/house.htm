It is considered to be a failing of the soul when one can not believe in Gods or miracles.  By the same point one is thought to be weak of heart if they don't believe in love or when they lack courage in their own abilities.  But what about when one can not believe their own eyes?  What has failed them then if they can't bring themselves to acknowledge what they've beheld?
<br><br>
I saw the house of miracles.
<br><br>
I wandered 12 nights and 13 days, with nothing to stare at but the sun as it crawled across the sky with dreadful sluggishness, as if burdened by some unseen weight
<br><br>
Somewhere on the plains I wandered, I'd grown complacent with the scenery and was concentrating more on what lay at my feet than what was ahead.  Imagine my panic when suddenly I was beneath a hulking shadow, as if some great beast had reared up before me and caught me unaware.
<br><br>
Its face was etched gray stone, composed of blocks the size of a human torso aligned in precision fashion atop one another.  I was at the house's corner and could therefore see the complexity and perfection of two planes:  The front and the north facing Side.  Its surface was rough, like volcanic rock, but so evenly cut and arrayed that there was barely the space for mortar to sluice between the stones.  The trim was a dark wood, turned a bit greenish with age, making the frames of the windows appear to have the façade of ancient tarnished bronze.
<br><br>
And the windows, Oh they were something to behold.  There was nary a clear pane of glass or a simple solid hue.  Each window was a divine tale told in shards of colored glass.  Some craftsman had spent decades creating and placing these wonders of stained glass, and for what?  There was not a person around to be seen.  They had made a work of art that was too remote to gather appreciative viewers.
<br><br>
As it was getting to twilight, the place was becoming more sinister with the adoption of shadows.  The darkness welled in its edges and its doorways, as if coming home to roost after a long day's absence.  Dark predatory forms gathered, or so my mind told me, in the alcoves beneath windows and behind the low shrubs which lined the side of the house.   
<br><br>
And the darkness had grown so thick at points that I made no notice of the figure at the front stoop until it spoke.  And the sudden start was enough to make me ponder fleeing back from my appointed path.
<br><br>
"Are you a soldier?"
<br><br>
I peered into the dark spot that was the house's door, currently open.  Within I could see rows of white pillars  like ivory teeth lining it's black maw.  The figure there was all but invisible.  She might have gone on wholly ignored if not for the white dress which caught a bit of the reflected sun.
<br><br>
"No.  Not really… I mean… I'm… I don't know what I am," I stammered, aware that this statement of uncertainty was the only thing that I was certain about at that moment.
<br><br>
"But you've shed blood recently," she asked, her voice non-judgmental, inquiring the way one might ask if I'd like a drink or if I had ever tasted roast boar.
<br><br>
"Yes.  I was in a skirmish nearly a fortnight ago," I replied.
<br><br>
She must have heard the weariness of death in my voice, for she paused a moment then said, "Come in."
<br><br>
I was not going to argue.  I stood there staring at the changing face of the house long enough that I had not bared witness to the passing of the sun.  Behind me it had gone into that darkest of graves, the ocean beyond the great smoky gray peaks to the west.
<br><br>
I mention the sun's passing as a type of death.  Lately I often think of it that way.  This is something that had never really occurred to me before my participation in that battle.  And since then I had each night stopped my travels just in time to stand and watch the sun's fire be smothered.  It never died in quite the same manner twice.  Sometimes it trailed lavish pinks and deep ochres other times it was infinite shades of blue and purple.  And it seems death had become a preoccupation of mine.  But this night was the first night in weeks where I would not witness something passing to oblivion, be it sun or man.
<br><br>
I took to the stoop and entered the doorway.  The woman in white had withdrawn far enough to make way for me, then she closed the door.  Inside here there was little light, but for below.  While there was a set of stairs going upwards, there was a much larger, wider set of stairs descending into the earth.  And down there somewhere was a fire, for the light moved in an exaggerated rolling motion.  Perhaps there was water too down there, to reflect the light in such a way.
<br><br>
Something touched my face. Water.  In fact, as I came to a halt I could hear droplets touch down all about me, rapping out a random rhythm on the stone of the ground and steel of my few armaments.
<br><br>
"You are in time for our meal," she said, and led me to the dining hall below.  And the rain inside the house felt hot on my flesh, like a deep sultry breath.
<br><br>

<br>
I sat at the table in the company of the artist Eschendon and several other of his guests.
<br><br>
Mirak was a priest turned sculptor.  I had seen but one of his works, but came to realize that Eschendon had indeed spied a true talent in him.  Mirak was the member of a dead order of martyrs; One of those cults that dabbled in necromancy with the naïve belief that they could use evil to fight evil.  That of course is why the order was disbanded.  Its other members were dead or undead.  Mirak being the exception.
<br><br>
Aklose was a servant I suppose.  Nobody called him such, and none of the guests, or Eschendon for that matter, put any demands on him as such, but he busied himself by cleaning the halls and cooking meals.  I believe Durill mentioned he wandered in one day, several years prior, began fussing about, and never left.
<br><br>
Ah, Durill.  Sweet, beautiful Durill.  I confess that I am a slave for Elvish women.  It's my major failing that they can bend me to their will.  I believe that there has rarely been an elvish woman who I did not feel had some subtle sensuality; Like they held exotic secrets in the stores of their mind and in the shadowed places between their knees.  And Durill was a red haired beauty with eyes the hue of flickering lanterns; Orange one moment, gold the next.
<br><br>
Eschendon himself was a dwarf.  And like all dwarves I had met, he was larger than life.  They had this lust for life that you don't as often encounter in humans, elves, or other sentients.  I had at first mistaken this as some attempt to compensate for their size; To project themselves as mighty men so as to compete with humans, but I realized they are like this also when only in the company of each other.  It's a trait I admire.
<br><br>
"So what do you say," Mirak questioned me.  I couldn't recall the question.  He called me by my birth name, which I was still using at that point in time.
<br><br>
"Your battle.  Who won?" He asked, realizing I had lost my train of thought.
<br><br>
"I don't know."
<br><br>
"You mean you deserted before the fight was done?"
<br><br>
"I mean… I don't know what side I was on."
<br><br>
This elicited a laugh from Mirak.  Durill just seemed to contemplate me.
<br><br>
"I walked on the battlefield, picked up a sword and started fighting," I said, feeling I owed only truth to my benefactors.  After all, they were founders of this feast.
<br><br>
"When one fights for ideology or for purpose, this is war, correct?" he paused, prepared to make his point with the acknowledgement from the assembled group.  He then continued, "So what is it then when on simply walks up to a stranger and lops off their head?  Where I come from, they call this murder."
<br><br>
I had a hard time arguing with this.  Nonetheless, it bothered me to be put on the spot in this way.
<br><br>
I retorted, "Except that those who stepped onto a battlefield realized that their lives were in danger and could expect to be killed or at the very least, wounded."
<br><br>
"Really," he said, "I'm sure they didn't view it as murder.  I'm just wondering if you do.  After all, you were not motivated by money or by power.  You had no stake in the fight  So why did you do it?… Was it the blood?  Was it the dismay on their faces as they fell?"
<br><br>
With this he took large gulp of wine from the goblet in front of him, but his eyes never left me.  His face which had once seemed friendly was now taut; Sharp as an arrow, and pointed straight at me in accusatory fashion.
<br><br>
I don't know from where within me the next comments came.
<br><br>
"Is that your opinion as clergy?  I imagine you've seen to rites; Given instruction to the dead as their soul departed.  Is that your opinion as an official representative of the gods?"
<br><br>
I could see that this tact had unbalanced him.  He was neutralized by a combination of shock and anger; Both were visible in the curve of his brow and the squint of his eyes.  He was here as an artist, but it was obvious he was hiding from his priesthood.  So I continued.
<br><br>
"Tell me father, have you ever done more than wave goodbye?  Have you ever stood in the sun, your hands shaking from the rush of combat.  The exhilaration of fear, the anticipation of pain, the knowledge that as much as you held that weapon in your hand, you were in fact a weapon held in the hands of the gods?"
<br><br>
I paused for dramatic effect then continued, "I thought not.  Passivity and martyrdom are your domain.  Hide behind your relics and your 'hallowed be thy's.  Leave the fight to those with the courage to confront the animal and the man within themselves."
<br><br>
He tossed the goblet across the table.  It was easy enough to deflect.  It was as if it came at me in slow motion.  I simply raised a hand and brushed it aside form the air as if swatting a gnat.  He then reached to the roast beef on the table and picked up the knife and without hesitation lunged across the table.  The others had leaped back at this point, surprised by the display.  I had fought dozens on that field, and while I was but a fledgling in the ways of combat, I was still more experienced than this taker of oaths and hearer of sins.   The knife did indeed find me, but only as a flesh wound.  It cut through my right bicep.  I simply grabbed his arm and pulled him forward across the table, flipping him onto the floor.
<br><br>
When he came to rest, he was not completely still, nor was he still enraged.  Instead his motions were short, erratic spasms.  I reached down and turned him face up, already knowing what had happened.  The blade he held had found its way into his rib cage.
<br><br>
The look on his face will not be forgotten soon.  He was a man who had at last found the animal within, but who did not like what he'd found.  He was with us only a few more seconds before he let out a small death rattle and lay still.
<br><br>
Durill put her hand on my wounded arm, pressing some dinner linen against it.
<br><br>
She looked at me inquisitively, as if pondering my nature.  We were face to face, her eyes flickering gold.
<br><br>
If she voiced her unspoken question about why death seemed to be following me, I couldn't explain it.  Not at that moment.
<br><br>
Aklose was already throwing down linen to absorb the blood from his clean floor.
<br><br>
Eschendon at last spoke, "When Durill has finished tending you, come up to the workshop and I'll put you to work."
<br><br>
"Work?" I asked, "Sir, I'm no artist."
<br><br>
"We are all artists," he said, moving toward the door but glancing back to the body on the floor, "But we must find you a better medium in which to work."
<br><br>
End of Part 2.
