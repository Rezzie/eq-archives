Even though they were alone in the room and Lozanth was wide awake, Argossa's scream was enough to cause him to pull his sword and leap up.
<br><br>
The scream was unearthly, torturous; A scream of mortal terror.
<br><br>
He lit the candle and could see that she was bolt upright in bed, her eyes swimming with a remembered dream.  She was looking at him, but seeing something else.
<br><br>
Lozanth sat down beside her and  set the candle on the stand beside the bed.  He rested one hand behind her head and could feel the sweat that had accumulated there.
<br><br>
The door burst open and in came Norvath, the innkeeper, his hammer in one hand and his passkey in the other.
<br><br>
"Erudite bastard," came from Norvath's lips in a quick growl.  He moved toward Lozanth, who vacated his position on the bed and took up a defensive posture.
<br><br>
"Stop!"
<br><br>
Argossa came out of her mild stupor long enough to stop the wrong about to be committed before her.
<br><br>
"It was a dream," she said to Norvath, "I… I had a dream."
<br><br>
Norvath squinted at the much taller man.  A squint that seemed to say <em>I'd bust you like a twig</em>.  Lozanth actually voice his response.
<br><br>
"Any time, little man."
<br><br>
Norvath looked back to Argossa and said, "Can I bring you anything?"
<br><br>
"No," Argossa shook her head, "Thank you.  No."
<br><br>
Norvath left and Lozanth finally lay down his blade and again sat beside her.
<br><br>
"What is it?  What did your sleeping mind recall?"
<br><br>
"It was not a memory."
<br><br>
He pulled his sack from beneath the bed and withdrew some brandy from a jug therein, then handed it to her.
<br><br>
"It was a glimpse of something I'm sure has come to pass; Something I could not have witnessed."
<br><br>
He returned to the chair beside the bed where he had been sleeping.  If he acted more casual perhaps this would coax the story from her.
<br><br>
"Do you… want to tell me about it?"
<br><br>
Argossa looked at the cup of brandy she had gripped in both hands.
<br><br>
"Tomorrow."
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
"Cracks in the sky," she mused.  Lozanth looked at the horizon and saw what she meant.  There were clouds the texture of granite, buffeting each other and letting out a slight groan every once in a while.  Amid their ritual of friction were strange dark lines made perhaps by smoke swirling upward.  It gave the outward impression of a cracked stone battlement.
<br><br>
"Are the gods coming out," Lozanth asked with a slight tone of bemusement, "or are we breaking in?"
<br><br>
Argossa who had stared at the horizon since they left Norvath's Inn on the highway suddenly dropped her eyes back to the road.
<br><br>
She wondered if she could say the words.  She glanced at Lozanth and he was studying her in his casual way.  She could tell him.  Who else would care?
<br><br>
She stopped in the road and stopped only one step later.  The sky groaned a little.
<br><br>
"I saw him."
<br><br>
"Who," asked Lozanth, wondering if she meant her god and simultaneously trying to remember if she had a god she worshipped.
<br><br>
"Alakirr… my husband."
<br><br>
Lozanth felt the cold fingers of truth tapping at his spine.  Perhaps what he had been told was true.  To hear the answer to something you were loath to ask was a disturbing thing.
<br><br>
They stood face to face on the path beneath the grinding sky.
<br><br>
"I went to his grave and stood over it.  I  was seeing myself as if from outside my body.  I reached out to lay a flower on his grave.  A hand reached up.  A woman's hand.  I could then see from overhead that the grave was open and that the body… his body… was exposed.  But he was not alone.  There were dozens of people in there, their bodies overlapping and wrapping about one another.  All were writhing, and in the middle of it was Alkirr.  His face was so blank.  So, so blank…"
<br><br>
Her voice trailed off and her head began to shake with this last statement.  Then she cleared her throat and continued.
<br><br>
"The hands were moving and beckoning me.  I looked around and could see that all the ground had become a grave.  I was in a sea of moving bodies… torsos, limbs, no faces except that of Alkirr.  I think most disturbing of all was something that I think I simply interpreted from the dream."
<br><br>
"You are the only one who can know what the dream was about.  What you think about the dream is the only opinion that matters.  What did you interpret?"
<br><br>
"I got the impression… that those limbs and hands… that they were all his.  That they were acting in unison because they were just extensions of him.  He would think 'wave to her' and they would do it."
<br><br>
The Erudite put his arm around her.
<br><br>
"We don't go to Kelethin, do we," he said.
<br><br>
She looked back up the fork in the road, to the horizon and the fissures of smoke that had grown more pronounced.  And they both began to walk toward that horizon of moving stone, both thinking that it was as if they were putting themselves against the grinding wheels of heaven.  They would sharpen or break.
<br><br>
And if what Lozanth was told was correct, then this would be his last walk.  That grinding of stone that he imagined was the sarcophagus lid being lowered over his grave.  For now with the story of Argossa's dream laid out before him, there could be little doubt.  He had come this far disbelieving the story he had been told about the dark magics, about the dead and their need to revenge themselves on the living.  And most disturbingly of all, if the prophecies were correct, this would be the last day of his life.
