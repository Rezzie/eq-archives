<b>Part Two</b>
<br><br>
	"Ah, But you do not know, as of yet, the wisdoms spoken in M'Lord's words.  Not many are there that can fathom the depths of what IS truth and light.  I believe, though some of my brethren may not agree with me, that in order to embrace that which IS the truth is to embrace all that is!"  t'Ceira's head swam with all the twists and turns in Diane's logic.
<br><br>
	"Yes, yes, yes.  But, my dear Paladin and most gracious Diane... What IS the truth?  What IS it that all must embrace... 'All that is?', you say?  Well, well... What, exactly, IS?"  Hargor replied, a thoughtful smile on his face.  
<br><br>
	"What is... IS that all races were created by the Gods... known by the Gods... AND... they BELONG to THIS WORLD!"  Diane emphasized her words with slight tilts to her head and small waves of her hands, "THEREFORE!", She raised her finger to make yet another point, "ALL races must be accepted as they are and we, as a race created ourselves, must embrace them as part of the truth and light!"
<br><br>
	"Ah yes, but by using your own logic, my dear friend, you MUST see that some races were made to be evil, and therefore... if we all are to embrace the truth and light... must accept them as who the Gods made them, and... being who the Gods made us... hate them."  With a satisfied grin the Wizard, Hargor, winked at t'Ceira as she sat upon the moonlit beach with the debaters, nibbling on a bit of cheese, trying to keep up with the meaning of all this discussion.
<br><br>
	"Well, yes, you do have a point there.  But, as I have stated many times both in this discussion and in past debates as well, if one is to be a true follower of Truth and Light then one must look at the microcosm, not the macrocosm of such that the Gods have done, insomuch that one should look at the individual heart and not the heart of the race."  t'Ceira's eyes glazed over a bit trying to keep up with Diane's words, but found her attention wandering.
<br><br>
	Wishing Darvinn was here and not off foraging, t'Ceira let the voices of Diane and her new friend, Hargor drift over her as soothing background noise.  She smiled to herself thinking that it was odd, here she was, a Teir'Dal (as Hargor had informed her), sitting with two humans.  Humans, I might add to remind the reader that she had sworn to hate.  Remembering this caused t'Ceira's head to swim once again.  By the Gods they claim existed--t'Ceira thought to herself--I'm going to drown in all this Enlightenment!  Oh well, I suppose that not all human's are that bad, it's just that most are evil, she let her thoughts drift.  She had come to trust both Diane and Hargor in the last few months, completely unaware that Hargor was preaching the hating of her race simply because they were who they were.  She was, however, aware that Hargor had taken an intense liking to her, a problem which she had yet to rectify.  She was flattered that the man was interested in her, and he wasn't all that bad looking... long flowing yellow hair tied back into a ponytail, crystalline blue eyes that seemed to see into your very soul, sharp chiseled features that were dignified by the character of the man, with a tanned muscular body that belied the indoor type he claimed to be... but, t'Ceira's heart belonged totally to Darvinn.  Her thoughts snapped back to the conversation as she heard her name spoken.
<br><br>
	"... and Darvinn are my proof, my dear friend.  They, two from radically differing races, have come together and found TRUE love and they are each the LIGHT of each others life."  Diane set back and crossed her arms, breathing a bit heavily as if she had exhausted herself on that last point.
<br><br>
	"Oh... well... uh... yes, yes, yes...  But, and forgive me, my dear t'Ceira..." Hargor smiled softly at her, "... how does one know that their love is true?  This fellow..." He held his hand up to forestall any argument, "... and he is quite a formidable and trustworthy fellow... SAVED t'Ceira's life.  Not, only from the bouncers in that bar... harrowing time, I'm sure, my dear," he said as an aside to the dark elf, "... but, from countless monsters and most probably from the very bandits that razed her foster-mother's home.  So, is it true love or is it an intense gratefulness that one feels for the other."  And they were off again.  But, t'Ceira really didn't mind as she had just caught a glimpse of something BIG bounding down the beach with his backpack.
<br><br>
	Hargor saw Darvinn plop down in the sand in front of t'Ceira and felt the searing stab of almost physical pain as he caught her look upon her lover.  HOW--the Wizard thought to himself--can she find such a stinky gangling Oaf attractive!?  Hargor had used his spells to keep his physical mystique in top form, he was intelligent, very intelligent, and wise, yet she only looked upon him as a friend.  He was also willing to accept that, even though the other dark ones were evil, t'Ceira was not by virtue of being raised so near humans, the best race in all the worlds, as he had just pointed out to Diane.   He felt that if, just once, he could feel those beautiful lavender eyes resting upon him with the same love and devotion, his life would be complete.  But, in order to do so, he'd have to get rid of Darvinn for good.  How?  He thought, how could he do that? Death was out of the question as that would only cause t'Ceira to scorn the killer and, being the beautiful person she is, she would feel it her duty to avenge her lovers death.  Hargor would have to think of something, and soon, the two were talking about petitioning to get mated... and if that happened, Hargor would lose her forever.  Perhaps, he thought, I could use her passion to get to Neriak to get rid of him... hmmm...
<br><br>
	The conversation continued around t'Ceira and Darvinn as he dumped the contents of the backpack.  He had several pelts and a few rusty weapons, some odds and ends to sell and some meat too.  What a haul, t'Ceira thought and smiled up at her love.
<br><br>
	"Can you do anything with these pelts hon?" Darvinn asked with hope.  He really did need some better armor. 
<br><br>
	"I'll try" She answered, but had little hope of success.  The first two pelts she ruined in the process, they were just too big for her skill, but the third she was able to fashion into a hat to protect his head.  She proudly presented it to him with a laugh and a smile.
<br><br>
	"Wow, you're getting better at that hon."  He smiled back at her with pure adoration as he donned his new hat.  
<br><br>
	"Ooooo!  You look very handsome in your new hat!"  She admired him proudly.  Every piece of armor he wore was made by her hand.  There wasn't very much as she was still learning, but at least the tunic, pants, and hat were from her.  She'd really have to learn to do more stuff.  She reached up and pulled him down too her, softly kissing him.  As the kiss broke they gazed lovingly at each other, feeling the natural responses of two who love as deeply as they do.  Glancing at Diane and Hargor, they slipped into the night heading back to their shack.
<br><br>
	Their departure did not go unnoticed however, as Hargor turned to witness the kiss and watched them disappear.  Yes, he thought, I think I've got it now.  I know how to get Darvinn out of t'Ceira's life so she will be free to love me and I can grant her wish in the process.  Hargor felt that a trip to Neriak and back, knowing who had sent her, coupled with the fact that Darvinn was out of her life, then her love would naturally be transferred to where it belonged, him.  Yes--he mused--I have the perfect spells, and I will accomplish the feat within a fortnight, he vowed to himself as his eyes slitted evilly.  I will have t'Ceira as my own, or no one will have her!
