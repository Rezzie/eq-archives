By the time he managed to get himself back up the ladder to the poop deck, the sailors were all finished with their ritual sacrifices.  They had all climbed back into their various positions among the rigging, where they could continue to watch the proceedings without overcrowding the poop deck.  Glind was already at the railing.
<br><br>
"Ocean Lord, I give to you my father's hammer.  Rumor has it that his soul resides within.  If that is true, I ask you to take good care of him.  And beware of him, he never was much for the water...
<br><br>
I have come with these dear friends to ask that you allow us passage on your ocean so that we might be able to prevent a terrible war.  I have come to stop the birth of a terrible evil."
<br><br>
Glind looked down at the silver embellished brass hammer for a long moment.  Galm felt like calling out to him, one last plea that he come to his senses.  But Galm was no longer sure that Glind was out of his mind.  He was nagged by the feeling that this was an important quest.  He just wasn't clear why it had to be his family that paid the price for saving the world.  Then Glind gently tossed the hammer over the rail and into the calm ocean.  He thought he saw Glind shake a little as the hammer dropped out of his sight.  It seemed that even the stoic hero could have regrets.
<br><br>
Glind walked back to his place in the circle of onlookers to stand to the left of his wife.  She grasped his hand briefly, and then stepped forward to give her own sacrifice to Prexus.  She paused a moment as her husband had, and then tossed her small gift into the ocean.
<br><br>
"I have come to aid my husband."
<br><br>
Her speech was much more brief than Galm had expected.  But, in a way, it told far more of her reason for being here than anything longer could have.  She was here to stop the evil, certainly.  But that was not her true reason.  Perhaps she was as reluctant as Galm felt, but she was here to help Glind.  He watched her walk back to the circle, amazed at how little he had known about both Glind and Fealwin.  He decided to pay attention to the sacrifices that the others made.  It wouldn't hurt to learn something more about his new travelling companions.
<br><br>
As everyone on board watched with obvious intensity, the Human bard took the short walk to the rail hesitantly.  If there was any grace to him in the taverns of Freeport, there was certainly none of it still in him this far out to sea.  He fumbled as he unslung a beautiful lyre from his back.  From his place in the circle of watchers Galm was hard-pressed to see any details, but it had at least a few jewels on its face.  They flashed him in the bright afternoon sun.  Hautin, as Galm would learn was his name, faced the sea as he played his lyre.  The music that he played for the Ocean Lord was haunting.  It sounded to Galm like a melody of loss, and a song of longing.  He played for several minutes before he began to sing.  The sound of his voice flowed so seamlessly into the song of his instrument that for a moment Galm was unaware that he had actually begun singing.  Wordlessly he sang, using his voice as a wind instrument to accompany the strings he played.  It added a depth that tugged at Galm's heart.  All of the losses that he had suffered, the death of his father, the murder of his little sister, the day his young love had left him for another...  all the losses of his life swelled his heart and made it heavy.
<br><br>
But slowly the tune changed.  The sound of loss remained, Hautin's voice continued as it had, but the lyre became the voice of hope.  It sublimated the bard's voice, used it as a stepping stone to bring the music to a higher, happier place.  Without the sad voice of loss the voice of the lyre wouldn't have been as strong, nor as potent.  From the depth of loss came the song of hope.  Galm began to slowly raise his head with the change in the tune.  Only then had he realized that he had lowered it.
<br><br>
And suddenly it stopped.  Abruptly the lyre ceased to sing and only the voice of sorrow remained.  For a long moment Hautin continued to sing, his voice slowly fading out only after Galm had become fully depressed again.  Damn all these people and their ability to pull on his emotions.
<br><br>
"To you, Prexus, Lord of the Ocean, I give my finest friend.  The companion that I have traveled with for the last five years.  The voice that guides me."  With that the bard tossed his lyre over the rail.  "I have come simply because someone must record what happens here.  Someone must teach others the tale, so that the loss and risk that these fine people take is not forgotten by their relatives, their children and their ancestors."
<br><br>
Hautin did not walk with any more certainty as he returned to his spot in the circle than he had when he left it.  Again several tears fell from his cheeks.  Galm wondered at the emotional attachment that this Human had for everything.  In the last ten years he could only remember seeing anyone cry once, not counting the several dozen men that he had seen crying due to lost limbs or some sort of terrible internal injury.  Now he's seen the same man cry twice in the course of an hour.  For some reason he didn't think that he'd feel safe with that man standing guard at his back in a pressing battle.  He'd stick close to the holy warriors.
<br><br>
For a long moment after the bard had merged back into the circle, no one moved.  Galm started to panic.  It was probably his turn to go to the railing and give up something to the Ocean Lord.  Not only did he not want to do that, he had no idea what to toss overboard.  He wasn't in the habit of becoming attached to things.  He traveled a lot, and anything that he valued he inevitably lost.  When he had rushed off to catch this ship he had grabbed his backpack, which was always packed, and a large sack of hard bread from the kitchen.  He didn't own any jewelry.  He tended to pick up weapons as he went.  If the last guy he killed had a sharper axe, he'd use that one rather than sharpening his old one.  What was it that he had that was of value to him?
<br><br>
With all of the grace that the bard had lacked added to all of his own, the High Elf stepped up to the railing.  Tall and straight as the mast, his golden hair waved freely behind him.  He was pale and gaunt, but he was still pretty.  And also in direct contrast to the Human that had preceded him, he was completely emotionless.  He wore the long robes of a wizard.  Galm had little experience with spell casters, but if this fellow was researching cross-continental teleportation he had to have a tremendous amount of power.  That was probably the reason for his arrogant look.  Not that Galm had seen many High Elves that didn't look arrogant.
<br><br>
"I am Roawed, wizard of Felwithe and master the seven circles.  I have come to gather the information that I need so that I might travel to Kunark through my magics..."  Roawed paused.  He glanced at Omonero.  The priest nodded.  Roawed's brow creased, he looked distinctly unhappy.  He turned back to the rail.  "It is my intention to travel frequently to Kunark, once I am able to do so without traversing the surface of your ocean.  I offer you this, the efforts of many years of labor.  Something that I may never be able to replace."  The Elf reached into a large sack that hung at is waist from a long strap over his shoulder.  He pulled out an oversized book, its cover intricately tooled leather.  The simple leather strap and lock made it look almost like a young girl's diary, but they held the pages firmly together as the tome arched over the railing.
<br><br>
When Roawed returned to his spot, Galm felt himself walking toward the rail.  He withdrew his longest knife, just last week the proud possession of an Orc King of some sort.  He stood at the railing, only just tall enough to see over.  "Lord of the Ocean, I am here..." he took a deep breath to steady himself.  His life was about to change in ways that he could not predict.  "I am here to protect Fealwin."  He then reached toward his throat with the long curved blade.  He paused with the blade at his neck, thinking that for all of this he deserved a dramatic moment.  And then he began cutting off his beard.  The symbol of his status as a man among his people, and it cut away from his face with surprising ease.  With each handful of red hair that he tossed over the side of the ship his eyes grew wetter.  By the time he was done he was crying like a baby.  Or like a bard.
