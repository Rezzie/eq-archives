"Backs toward center!" Edarian commanded.  
<br><br>
Edarion had instructed us previously, that if each of us positioning our backs towards each other, covering a ninety degree firing zone, would prevent us from being out flanked during an attack with multiple aggressors.  The three of us, now facing in opposite directions, readied for attack as the three remaining Ogres approached us.  Before Edarion could issue a second command they were on us.  The first Ogre swung his club upward and then downward with a vigorous thrust towards Edarion's head.  Edarion raised his shield to parry the attack, and was immediately knocked backwards from the force of the blow.  
<br><br>
With my target now in front of me, I adjusted for his attack.  He raised his club and swung.   I erected both my long swords in an "X" to block the force of the blow.  I was instantaneously knocked to the ground.  Just as I hit the ground, my attacker swung his weapon for a second strike, this time aiming for my head.  I rolled on the ground as the club hit the ground with a dull pounding sound.  While climbing to my feet I was challenged with yet another blow, this one striking me in the arm.  I winced in pain, releasing the sword I had clutched in that hand.  Quickly recovering before my aggressor could finish me off, I swung my sword with my now one good arm.  I scored a slashing blow to the Ogre's throat.  It was then that I discovered the Ogre's anatomy must be very close to the human anatomy, judging by the amount of blood that was gushing from the jugular vein in its neck.  He clutched his throat with both hands, and turned to run.  Before he could take two more steps I finished him off with a fatal pierce to the head.  The Ogre dropped to the ground.  
<br><br>
My body screamed in agony as a stabbing pain in my back interrupted my victory celebration.  I collapsed to the ground.  As I hit the ground I looked up to see both Edarion and Jalen fighting their targets, and a fourth Ogre now towering over me.  He was obviously pissed at me for killing his cousin.  Again my body screamed in agony as a second blow from his club struck me in the leg.  The Ogre was incredibly quick as he applied yet a third blow, this one striking me in the head.  My mind started to cloud over, as everything seemed to white out.  I tried to focus on the Ogre to avoid his next thrust when, to my amazement, he stopped his attack.  He heaved both his arms into the air and screamed.  His body began to glitter in effulgent red, and in that instant his chest cavity exploded, expelling his innards onto the ground.
<br><br>
From out of the shadows behind the Ogre's corpse stepped out a small dark, robed figure.  His face remained shadowed even in direct light from the Ogre's campfire.  
<br><br>
"Thank you for saving my life." It was all I could do to get those words out. 
<br><br>
I turned to observe Jalen and Edarion defeat their assailants.  They rummaged the corpses, and then turned towards the foreigner.  
<br><br>
"Hello stranger" Edarion called out.
<br><br>
"Most people call me Toora." Toora said with a laugh.  
<br><br>
I tried to stand on my feet and became woozy and fell back to the ground.  I looked up to see Toora's hands beginning to glow as he waved them in unison.  A warm feeling then came over my entire body, and the pain I once felt seemed to vanish.   
<br><br>
"How long have you been here?" Jalen questioned.
<br><br>
"Just got here this morning." Toora answered.  "I was traveling to Freeport to do some trading, and decided to go off trail for a bit of exploring.  I stumbled on the broken gates outside and decided to poke around a bit."  He added.
<br><br>
"How far did you go back?"  Edarion asked.
<br><br>
"Well not far.  If you walk back that way you'll find several chambers, but each of them was full of creatures I didn't care to tangle with.  I was heading back out when I stumbled onto these four Ogres.  I was afraid to leave.  Actually you guys saved me."  He said and then chuckled.
<br><br>
"Wait!" Jalen interupted.  "I hear something."
<br><br>
We all stood there straining our ears to hear what the Barbarian was tuning in too.  
<br><br>
"I don't hear anything." I scuffed.  
<br><br>
"Listen" 
<br><br>
After a few minutes of straining I was able to make out the sound of feet shuffling, and the sounds of grunting.  It must have been the Ogre that ran in the beginning of our combat, coming back with his friends.  
<br><br>
"We better get out of here." I advised.
<br><br>
The sound was growing louder.  
<br><br>
We headed for the exit.  My heart was pounding, as I ran as fast as my legs could carry me.  Jalen scanned for a hiding place suitable for our party as we exited the cave.  Edarion was the first to spot a small cove, molded by two stalagmites, formed by the earth's crust.   We dove under cover.  After a few seconds several large figures appeared from out of the cavern.  There must have been thirty Ogres, all armed for battle.  Last to exit the cave, and commanding orders to his minions, was their commander.  A large Ogre wearing chain mail armor.  He wielded a huge two-handed bastard sword.  
<br><br>
"Octok snalt!" He barked.  
<br><br>
One of the soldiers appeared to be articulating with the officer and pointing out in our general direction.  The officer appeared to be very angered at the soldier's words, and began to demonstrate his power. With one swing, he slapped the soldier unconscious.  As the soldier dropped to the ground it was obvious that the commander was disappointed in his men's performance.  After a few minutes of searching they aborted in frustration, and entered the cave.  It was much later when Jalen finally spoke.  
<br><br>
"Ok.  I think its safe now."  He said as he climbed out of the hole, and onto his feet.  
<br><br>
We followed him.  
<br><br>
"Man I wonder what those men are guarding in there!" Edarion said with a sparkle in his eyes.  "Ogre's are known to hoard treasure from ambushing travelers.  
<br><br>
"I hate Ogres.  Death to them all" Jalen spoke.  
<br><br>
A band of Ogres had killed Jalen's parents when he was a child. His parents had been traveling from Halas to Freeport on a trade route, when the party became lost.  They searched for hours until it became dark, and the commander decided they should make camp until daylight.  Being lost and in the dark was much too dangerous, as the party was not as strong as he would like it to be.   That night, while sleeping, a clan of Ogres ambushed their party, killing everyone.  When Jalen became a man, he vowed to avenge his parents death.  
<br><br>
"We need more men Edarion.  We cannot handle thirty Ogres."
<br><br>
"Your damn right we cant!  Did you see that commander!!??"   I added.
<br><br>
"Lets head back to Freeport and round up a party." Edarion said.
<br><br>
"I know an old man who can help us.  His magic is much more powerful than mine!" Toora spoke.  "It's on the way to Freeport." He added with a smile.  
<br><br>
Jalen smiled.  "Great then you'll travel with us Toora.  We could always use a good cleric."
<br><br>
"Yes but the price for my service is high." Toora grinned.
<br><br>
"Don't worry.  The Ogre's will being paying for your service this trip." Edarion said.
<br><br>
They laughed.
<br><br>
We started back for Freeport.  As we traveled I was thinking about the idea of declaring war on the Ogre camp.  I couldn't help but wonder just how many of them were really in there.   I had a bad feeling about the adventure that lay ahead.
