<b> The Good Things </b>
<br><br>
There are plenty of nifty features that are pretty cool.  When you go down
to 0 HP, you are knocked unconscious.  You still have time for your party
to heal you up or get that monster to quit attacking you.  While you lay
there staring at your helpless body, its lifeforce slowly drains away as
you bleed to death.  If you are healed, then you will wake back up and can
retreat and go heal up.

There are various menus for skills, socials, inventories, and so on.  You
can take any icon or any inventory slot and drag it into a macro box.  This
box is always available, even in full screen mode, so you can have easy 
access to your inventory, skills, or anything else without having to search
through the menus.

Of course, the graphics are stunning.  We've all seen the screenshots and
had to mop the drool off our keyboards.  Well, even the movies don't do 
it justice.  To see the smoothness of the animation and response to your
movements is truly amazing.  The graphical artists deserve a commendation.
