<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Nep, is there a place in this large world of Norrath that a little undersized gnome can find higher quality wolf pelts to make studded and reinforced armor? Or is it just a lie in the tailor's handbook that you can make small armor using medium and high quality wolf pelts? I have traveled almost all low to medium levels in Norrath but never seen any wolf good enough to drop anything other than ruined pelt. Nobody seems to know if the higher quality wolf pelts ever exist.  If they don't, and if one of your pillars of wisdom has a relation to the rulers of our world, can you ask them why we smaller races are being punished? I mean I have 3 backpacks full of medium quality cat and bear skin. Yet, although as a little fella I need more armor than that mighty barbarian warrior, I just cant sew anything for myself.  Thank you, and just remember: Gnome is beautiful...
<br><br>

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile, I can only agree with you that gnomes are beautiful.  Not to mention, cute, adorable and absolutely marvelously funny when they run.  It would be a pity indeed if there were no wolves to clothe you properly.  However, the good news is that you can find wolves in the Qeynos Hills and, I believe, perhaps in West Karana and Greater Faydark that will drop medium and high quality pelts.  It will take some perserverance but if you can travel to those areas, you may find the skins you need.  Another option though would be to find some players looking for skins to make large sized clothing who have wolf pelts and arrange a swap for your mutual benefit.  I wish you luck finding your clothing of choice and perhaps you'll send some good thoughts my way that someday, somehow, half elf bards can wear dresses.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Songsmith, I hope you can advise me.  I have noticed dark elves attacking guards and other locals in my home area.  Would it be considered a "bad thing" to aid the guards with healing spells and whatever else I can do.  I dislike sitting by, unable to stop these cowardly intruders.  But, there are so many things that seem to anger the powers that be...  Almost enough to make me want to play on a PvP server!  Thank you.  May Karana leave your lute-strings dry.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often the habit of those who no longer concern themselves with the protective function of guards to turn on the protectors of the young in the various homelands.  Sadly, however, despite your natural instincts to protect the locals of your home, it is illegal to buff the guards with healing or any other assistance against those who are fighting them.   It is also considered a circumvention of the pvp switch to train other npc's to those who are fighting guards.   Sometimes, the alien fighters will listen to some diplomacy as, of course, they are aware that the young of their own lands might suffer under similar circumstances, but often efforts at finding a peaceful solution will not be fruitful.  Then, unfortunately, in that instance you will have to leave it up to your deity to wreak vengeance on those who destroy the peace of  your community.   Thank you for your kind wishes about my lutestrings.  I can protect those pretty well with my cloak, but Karana always manages to get my hair wet.  Do you think she'd consider leaving it dry sometimes?

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings! Just recently I began what I hope is to become a long and fruitful career as a master jeweler but I still have much to learn. As I have not as of yet been able to purchase the enchant silver spell I have not been able to dabble around and learn about its inner workings. Therefore I am a little dumbfounded as to how this most wonderful spell actually works. I know for it to work initially one must have in his possession a bar of the purest silver. After a successful cast, that silver is now enchanted. But what happens if he has multiple bars in his possession? Do they all become enchanted with one cast or must the spell be recast for each bar? Also if the bars are stacked how can we tell which is the enchanted bar? Please, I am to be sure a person of only moderate means and have recently just spent my meager cache of funds in order to raise my skill level so I no longer possess the means to experiment on my own to learn this pertinent knowledge. I would be most grateful to you if you would be able to assist me in this small quest for knowledge.   Sincerely yours,
<br><br>
Rimuldar, Enchanter of the Eighth Tier and would-be Jeweler Extraordinier
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh I admire you for taking on the task of training in the exacting field of jewelry making.  Let me know when you have moved through your apprenticeship and perhaps I can custom order rings or a necklace from you.  In the meantime, it's my understanding from a new Pillar of Wisdom named Rosethorne that you must cast a separate spell on each bar of silver in order to enchant it.  A single spell will not cover an entire group of stacked silver.  If you have chosen to enchant only one bar of silver and it is stacked with others you have not altered, you should be able to right click on the bars and the message will show  you which is enchanted and which are not.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a very perturbing question which has caused my dear friends and "un"-friends if you get my meaning to scratch their flesh off their head. I am approaching the 3rd circle of spells and am in a bind as whether or not to attempt to purchase Vampiric Embrace. It seems like a wonderfully delicious proposition to suck the life out of those nasty little gnolls is Blackburrow, but is the spell really worth having, and casting? Does it work a lot, or just last a long time, so you get those delicious tidbits of lifeforce here and there?    
<br><br>
Aranauk, Gnomish Necro Extraordinaire
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vampiric Embrace may well prove to be a boon to you through the next few circles, up to about level 20.  However, it's important to understand that in order to use the spell, you must be in melee with the npc and while you will find yourself in such circumstances early on, you will also find as you grow in necro abilities that you need to avoid melee altogether, at which point the Vampiric Embrace may be retired to the back pages of your spellbook.   All of those I queried stated that they believed you would benefit from buying the spell and using it for awhile.  As far as working a lot or how long it lasts, the effect of the spell would probably be somewhat dependent on your dexterity and skill.   My information is that the spell works in a random manner.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail and well met.  I have a quick question that plagues a lot of people I have spoken with.  Weight.  I have almost a full suit of Bronze and try to keep both 1hs and 2hs up to max so I need to carry both weapons and a shield around with me plus loot.  Any suggestions for getting this under control?
<br><br>
Cormorant, Paladin of Marr, 15th Circle
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As the great Pillar of Wisdom, Tagad, pointed out, the fastest solution to your weight problem would be to earn or purchase a weightless bag to carry all the equipment you are not currently using or wielding.  I believe there is one such available in Highhold Keep or Pass, but asking around will probably get you the information you need to obtain such a bag.  Beyond that, you will probably wish to start replacing your bronze armor with magical armor which will weigh less and in some instances may give you a strength bonus.  (I'm not sure on that one though.)  You can also add jewelry and other items with plus strength statistics to boost your carrying power.  Finally, there are strength buffs available and, of course, you can always invite a bard along if they happen to know the tune to the strength song.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What are all the  pet commands?   I need to know so when my pet attacks my party members I can tell it to stop and it will.  Thanks.
<br><br>
Lelin
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The pet commands are mostly found in the online manual in your Everquest folder.  However, some additional pet commands have been added since the last time it was updated.  The pet commands I could find are:
<blockquote>
/pet (command) - gives orders to a charmed or summoned pet.  Sample pet commands:<br>
/pet guard here - tells the pet to guard its current location.<br>
/pet guard me - tells the pet to attack anyone that attacks it's master, or that it's master attacks.<br>
/pet follow me - tells the pet to follow you, but ends when you cross a zone line.<br>
/pet attack &lt;target&gt; - tells the pet to attack the designated target.<br>
/pet back off - tells the pet to stop its attack.<br>
/pet as you were - returns the pet to neutral, belaying all prior orders.<br>
	/pet get lost - Pet will suicide<br>
	/pet whos the leader - Pet will report who summoned it<br>
	/pet report health - Pet will tell you hit point status<br>
	/pet sit down - Pet will sit on one place and rest<br>
	/pet target - Will target Pet (or double click F1)</blockquote>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a problem it seems. I have played EQ since it was released, at least since April, and have failed miserably. I have never passed lvl 13 as my favorite character, a DE wizard. This is partly because I am on Rallos Zek, where killing humans is my favorite pasttime. Well, actually, Rallos Zek isn't much of a roleplaying place anymore, so I will not be on there anymore.  I have been playing for months and the decline of roleplaying has become obvious. The server is full of PKs (not murderers, vagabonds, bandits, but true killing-you-for-stuff-while-talking-to someone-else-about-football PKs).  This slows down leveling and even grouping, as members are killed off and looted frequently. It also affects small things. A lvl 6 shadowknight is knocked unconscious by a bear in Nektulos, the bear slain by a guard.  A passing lvl 4 necromancer kills him and takes his tunic. Or the shadowknight is killed by the necromancer while fighting a shadow wolf.  It has become unbearable.  *wow that was a rant*  Back on topic, I realize being a wizard is not good for leveling either. But many people can put in less than half the time I have and are lvl 50.  Vakor has well over 10 DAYS of time put in him. It isn't stats, I did start my wizard over after realizing the higher the intelligence the better, so Vak's intelligence is maxed at 134, with rings making it up to 138. I am desperately in need of help! 
<br><br>
Vakor
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me for playing on a pvp server like Rallos Zek that getting level 13 in 10 days of playing is not all that bad.  Just think how much time is spent retrieving corpses and planning retribution rather than in just smiting to level.   If, though, you have decided you want to play a wizard on a non-pvp server and would like to put some energy into leveling more quickly, here are suggestions from the Pillars of Wisdom.  First, you may wish to consider the possibility of playing a non-evil race as the potential for groups is generally higher.  Next, be patient and find a good group.  Remember, a wizard is only as powerful as his or her protectors, so you'll want to make sure your group values your services and takes good care of you.  A corollary to this is to avoid solo blasting away on npcs unless  you want to end up dead more often.  Finally, use the knowledge you have gained on your dark elf wizard to speed  you along your way with a new character and make sure to keep the door open to mentoring from other wizards above you in level.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I need ta know if the Kaglari Mana Doll Quest is operating correctly on the Erollisi-Mar Server.  Tanx
<br><br>
Ghater
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my goodness, utter silence from the Pillars of Wisdom and my own knowledge here is sadly lacking; in fact, it's nil.  I'd suggest that you send an email to questhelp@verant.com and ask someone there to let you know if the quest is working on your server.  You might also try a petition and see if a GM is available to confirm whether the quest is operational or not.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;About the beggar, while sitting around a kobold camp, I decided to pester my pet (us enchanters are silly like that sometimes).  In the midst of dancing, waving, and general nonsense, I begged from it, and got better. So if the writer was a mage, they can practice their begging skills on their pet.  I don't know if this will top out after a time, but I got my skill past 20 I believe. The pet never attacks like those darn cranky gnomish merchants did that once... grrr... =)
<br><br>
Leenee
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You must have presented an amusing sight to onlookers, what with your dancing and waving and general nonsense.  I wish I had been there to add some music to the proceedings.  It sounds like you have indeed happened upon an effective way to increase your begging skill.  It will be interesting to see if your future attempts at begging from npc's will  be fruitful.
<br><br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the question/answer of Olight on begging in issue 103, I'd like to know the places, conditions, skill needed, NPCs and about every precision on how one can get anything else but copper or silver from NPCs. Because (don't laugh) I am now a master beggar with 105 and NEVER got anything else. 
<br><br>
Farore on The Tribunal
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm truly sorry but I don't have the information you seek.  In some earlier columns, I did include other correspondence about begging and you might wish to check on that by using the search engine now included on EQ EXpress.  There were instances, if I remember right, of beggars being slightly more successful and there was some rumor that begging might possible reveal a quest or two, but I have no details for you on that.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I created my second character, I thought of something disturbing.  Here it is : I think (correct me if I' m wrong there) that if you equip, for example, a +2 sta ring, you only get 1 (or maybe 2) extra hp, but if you put 2 points more in sta when you create your character, you get 1 extra hp PER LEVEL.  That's a huge difference. The same observation should be applied to wis and int for mana.  On the other hand, when you equip for example a +2 str ring, you get (I think) the same bonus as if you put 2 extra points in str when you create your character.  Again, the same should apply for agi, dex and cha.  Now tell me if this statement if true or false, and, if it's true, why people keep saying you must boost agi or str when you can equip items and get the same result. Thanks for answering.
<br><br>
PS 1 : I am French so if you see mistakes, please correct them.  PS 2 : If you don't publish my question, could you send an answer on my e-mail? Thanks a lot. Your paper is wonderful, especially the Q&A, the bard's log and Archie's adventures ! 
<br><br>
Ophir, cleric from The Tribunal
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, I'm going to attempt an answer for you but I am by no means certain I'm right.  I think if I understand your question, the correct answer would be that I believe the statements you puzzled out are not true.  I hope others more skilled than I am will help out here, but there are so many factors affecting the rate of development of your basic stats and their eventual cap, that narrowing the discussion down to equipment vs. initial application of bonus points would not give you an accurate picture of what was happening.  It seems like perhaps the best way to develop the stats of a character would be to first decide upon how you wish to play the character.  For instance, as a bard, I know that I enjoy a certain amount of melee although it will always take a backseat to singing when song/instrument combinations are more important to the success of my group than the damage I can wreak wield weapons.  Thus I would probably add a few points more to dexterity and agility and maybe strength than if I simply was going to stand back and sing.  Once you have decided how you'd like to play the character, then you can choose how to apply your bonus points.  The deal here is that it seems to me that it is the combination of your bonus points plus the skills you develop and the equipment you acquire is a better way to plan your character development than thinking of either bonus points or equipment.  Thus, I'd throw all the points possible at character creation in those areas I wanted to max out at high level and then I'd go after the equipment that would help me get from my base stats to the level I wanted to secure.  I'm sorry if this doesn't adequately address your concerns but I do hope it helps.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I know many classes have complaints about some aspect of their class' perceived deficiency.  Knowing this, I hate to bring up a gripe, but what the heck!  As a Cleric, I am satisfied with the class.  I feel the Cleric is portrayed very well and is quite useful to a party (nevermind soloing, that defeats the purpose of EQ!).  However, I must complain vehemently about the Cleric-only armor quest(s).  From all I hear, only Paladins have it worse and I wonder if there was some anti-religious sentiments going on when the quest designers thought of what to do with Clerics / Paladins.   I shant bore you all with the details of the 7 hour respawn of an item necessary for the quest (and I won't remind everyone that the spawn point is in KITHICOR - the forest from hell) - nor will I rant and rave about how sitting in one spot waiting for 7 hours for the item to respawn COMPLETELY defeats the purpose of a MULTI-PLAYER online dungeon.  Nor will I complain too much about the apparent LOW STATS / BONUSES the Cleric armor has when compared to all other class-specific armor.  What I will complain about is that I have yet to see a SINGLE PIECE of this armor worn by any Cleric on my server (Tunare)!!!  Perhaps because of the listed reasons above, no one wants it?  Eh?  Does ANYONE know what it looks like, or where a picture might be posted on the web that I might look at??
<br><br>
I'll certainly never waste 7 hours (twice) waiting for a respawn in Kith, but it would be nice to at least know what it looks like!!  The rangers have nice green armor.  The warriors have the bluish crated armor - what do we Clerics have to (not) aspire to??  Is it radiant?  Is it dull?  What ARE the stats anyway?  Perhaps SOMEDAY Verant will rebalance the armor quests to help put some QUESTING back in EverQuest.  While I'm at it, what is the extent of the Cleric quest anyway?  Who, where and why do it?  Thanks for letting me ponder.
<br><br>
Coventina, Cleric of Karana's 20th Secret. Tunare's Server
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tagad and Garvok, both Pillars of Wisdom, have explained to me that the reason you have not yet seen a set of cleric armor on your server is precisely due to the reasons you have listed, i.e., the stats on the cleric armor are usually inferior to other pieces of equipment that clerics can wear (with the possible exception of the plus wisdom bracers), the effort required to get the equipment is immense, and there is essentially no point in spending that much time going after the cleric only armor.   I understand that the cleric armor is gold colored and that a few clerics have chosen to quest for it as a "dress uniform" for roleplay only.  I hope this helps some.  You might want to see if you could get a friendly cleric to set aside a few minutes to go over the quest with you if you decide this is an addition to your wardrobe worth having.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't really a question, but an answer to the mage Dhayn Daronol's question about raising skills outside of fighting.  I am a wizard, and have found that a way to raise my skills is to cast spells on myself.  Doing this will raise your skill level, but you must be careful not to kill yourself with direct damage or to root yourself in a bad area.  
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;None of you play on Rallos Zek do you??  Pooh... guess that means I'll never get to meet that cute little bard, Kyodai, in person... =(

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Grin, as a bard who definitely prefers to keep her head attached to her shoulders if at all possible, I must admit that the chances of me being seen on Rallos Zek are small.  Now, if Kyodai decides to give RZ a try, at perhaps you'll receive a greeting.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question but an answer about dueling and raising skill.  As far as Instill Doubt goes the duel had nothing to do with the skill going up. You can practice this on a rats corpse when you are at 40th level and it will go up just as if you where battling a red, yellow, (black/white),blue or green live mob.  Now Verant can get rid of that useless skill and make monks even more useless.  Dueling will not raise skills because it is seen as an exploit.  Instill Doubt you can even raise by targeting the ships while on them and practicing....go figure. 
<br><br>

<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing in about Instill Doubt.  I do understand the Instill Doubt is indeed nearly useless and in fact, might be quite dangerous in dungeons, so perhaps it will be a skill only the most compulsive of monks will choose to master.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In regards to multi-line auctions tis no wonder to me that most of the infer...eerr lesser learned races cannot figure it out. Simply do a /auction &lt;long list of items&gt; and hit enter. Then to resend, it hold down shift and hit the up arrow until you see the last bit of the &lt;long list of items&gt; release shift and hit enter.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am highly offended by your view on high elves.  EVERYONE knows that we are the only real race in Norrath.  Who else but a high elf wizard, especially the female ones, can stand face to face with a hill giant and melee and cast?  No one can stand up to us.  We are simply the best race.   All the others need to fall on their knees and admit to this soon.  It upsets me that I have to remind you about this.  I thought you, with all your great wisdom, would have realized this a long time ago.

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah Ardel, for heaven's sake allow me a bit of artistic license to amuse myself.  Smile, of course high elves are the best race, in their own estimation, and it is understandable that you'd take issue with my comments to the contrary.   Perhaps you ascribe too high a level of great wisdom to this simple bard?  Why not let bygones be bygones and buy me a drink next time we meet in Freeport?  I think we'd both enjoy it a lot more than the smell of rancid breath from a hill giant if we had to stand face to face with one.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings,  Once again I have noticed a question which many refute.  Pickpocketing does in no way affect the amount of loot for the party.  When a rogue pickpockets he "accesses" an "area" of loot which is
purposely set aside for this action. The amount of loot which is dropped is the same regardless of whether a pickpocket was at work or not.  Hopefully that cleared that up :)  Continue with the fantastic work you have been doing for the last years.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your letter.  I believe your information was correct at an earlier stage of the game (certainly at least  in parts of beta).   However, this past week, Abashi, the new internet spokesperson from Verant, did address this debate and I'm copying his statement as posted on EQ Vault so that we can all be  up-to-date on the status of pickpocketing.
<br><br>
<em><font color="blue">Reading EQVault, Abashi says:</font color> 
<br><br>
Could we have an official statement as to the history and current state of pickpocket?   Most believe that pickpocket now takes from the lootable "pocket" and that this is relatively new. If this is true, could you also explain why it was changed?   Pickpocket is one of my favorite rogue abilities, and I would hate to see it make me an outcast to other players. Many groups are wary of allowing a rogue in who may steal from the group. 
<br><br>
<b>Pickpocket takes from the same loot pool as if you killed the creature. There are some exceptions however. <br>
1) Magic items cannot be pickpocketed. <br>
2) The last coin of any type (plat, gold, silver, copper) cannot be pickpocketed. <br>
The only change to pickpocket since release was to prevent someone from taking magic items. <br><br>
Hope this clears things up. <br><br>
