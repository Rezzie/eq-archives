The rain fell heavily outside the tavern, reflecting the mood of the wizard standing before the window.  Preferring to use mundane forms of travel whenever possible, he was forced to wait until the rain let up before boarding the SeaKing and travelling to Kerra.  Sipping from his glass and glaring out the window, Ozymandius was lost in introspection.
<br><br>
Then someone goosed his behind.
<br><br>
"Boo" whispered an impish voice from behind him.
<br><br>
"Ack!" the mage jumped and whirled about, glaring down at the person that had accosted him in such an undignified manner... and met the gaze of the greenest eyes in all of Norrath.  Forcing himself to remain outraged, despite the overwhelming urge to smile into those mischievous eyes, he growled "Nepenthia! How many times have I told you NEVER to sneak up on me? Do you realize how dangerous that is?"
<br><br>
"Mmm... but I LIKE danger.  What, exactly, would you do to me, and would it cost extra if I enjoyed it?" purred the young bard, striking a suggestive pose and batting her eyelashes innocently.
<br><br>
"Bah!" grumbled the wizard, then set down his glass and swooped the small half-elf into his arms, hugging her.  "You can light my darkest days, my young friend.  How have you been?"
<br><br>
Burying her face in his chest and returning the hug, she giggled and said "I'm amazing, old friend.  But I thought everyone knew that."  She then stepped back from him and proceeded to open and examine a pouch she did not have before she hugged him.  "Hmm... what's in this?"
<br><br>
"Give me that!" snapped the old wizard as he snatched the bag back.  "You know better than to pick my pockets, child.  There is no telling what you'll find hiding in my robes."
<br><br>
Nepenthia grinned slyly "Well, I remember one time I found..." and stopped in response to Ozymandius wagging finger and stern expression.  "Oh pooh, why are you such a grump today?  I just came over to give you a warm hello when you get all fatherly on me.  If I wanted a daddy, I'd steal one."
<br><br>
Nepenthia turned and walked over to a table, then turned back around and smiled winningly at the old wizard.  "Come sit so I have a lap to perch on."
<br><br>
Sighing in resignation, Ozymandius walked over to the proffered chair and had a seat.  The bard then proceeded to nestle herself comfortably into his lap with a great deal of wiggling and fidgeting.
<br><br>
"Do you have ANY idea how... distracting that is?" growled the wizard quietly, having to fidget a bit himself.
<br><br>
"Hmmm?  Distracting?  Why would you say that?" she asked, her emerald eyes huge and innocent.
<br><br>
"Harumph.  What brings you to Qeynos, child?" Ozymandius reached for his wine while the bard grabbed her own goblet and sipped delicately, her gaze utterly adoring of the wizard.  He growled warningly and she giggled and took a more serious expression.
<br><br>
"Things got ugly in Freeport, so I left.  And no, before you ask, I was not chased."
<br><br>
"Have you ever been chaste?" asked the wizard slyly.
<br><br>
Nepenthia rather nobly stuck her tongue out, then continued her report.  As she spoke, her voice lowered and all traces of girlishness vanished.  Anyone happening to glance that way would have seen a pretty young bard flirting with the old wizard, not an experienced bard reporting her concerns on the state of the world. "Teir'dal activity in the Commons area has dropped to almost nothing, and Orc movements are on the rise.  I found it odd to see Orcs so far from Faydwer but was unable to gather any more specific information in the time I had.  What do you suppose they are up too?"
<br><br>
Ozymandius frowned in thought, idly taking one of Nepenthia's hands and removing it once again from within his robes as she giggled.  "Things are moving too quickly.  My old adversary is not normally this quick in his movements, nor this sloppy.  I'm missing something and that troubles me."
<br><br>
"Oh, another thing.  They are looking for HER again," she said as she speared a piece of cheese from a plate on the table with Ozymandius' dagger and nibbled on it delicately.
<br><br>
The wizard frowned, recognizing the dagger as the one he kept deep inside his robes, then shook his head.  "Are they now?  Hmmm...do they have any idea where she might be?"
<br><br>
"Nope.  The are quite put out with you by the sound of it.  Vashaar must want her REAL badly to be whipping his flunkies such as he is.  Why do you suppose that is?"
<br><br>
"One can never truly know the mind of a madman, my friend, much less the mind of a madman in the thrall of the Prince of Hate.  But whatever it is he wants with her, Winter is the key and she must be kept away from him.  If Vashaar is willing to tear the world apart to have her, it behooves me to keep her from him, even if I do not know why." Ozymandius turned and gazed back out the window again, grey eyes lost in thought.
<br><br>
Nepenthia set down her goblet, leaned very close, and nibbled upon his ear, whispering  "So, old man...how long are you in town for?"
<br><br>
The wizard took a deep breath and endeavored to stave off his body's very un-wizened reaction.  "Ahem...not THAT long, unfortunately.  I must make haste to Faydwer and check the preparations there."  With that he gently extricated himself from beneath the bard and got to his feet, his companion nimbly sliding to the floor.
<br><br>
She then stepped up onto the chair, leaned close, threw her arms around his neck, and kissed him upon the tip of his nose.  Leaning back a bit and gazing into his eyes, she whispered  "Be careful, old friend.  I do not understand all that is going on, but I do know that Vashaar does not like you very much and would enjoy nothing more than to see you come to a bitter end.  That is one song I would hate to sing."
<br><br>
Ozymandius kissed her on the cheek, hugging her tightly, then stepped back.  "Me?  I'm always careful," chuckled the wizard.  "Seriously, I'll be fine. Vashaar can not directly act against me because of the pact, and I have no fear of his minions.  My concern is for the rest of the world.  Stay around Qeynos and gather information.  I shall return for you shortly."
<br><br>
The familiar glowing sphere grew from his hands to encompass all of him, then flashed and vanished, taking the wizard with it.
<br><br>
Nepenthia gazed at the empty air for a moment, then turned to the window, watching the rain fall.  "Please do" she whispered to no one in particular, then shook herself, resumed her frivolous guise, and sauntered from the tavern.
