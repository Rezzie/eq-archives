The two Rangers ran along the game trail, leaving little indication of their passage.  Taking long, distance-eating strides through the forests of Lesser Faydark, they hunted.  They had hunted for several hours with no sign of prey, and Maclir was becoming concerned.  This area should be teeming with animals, as far from civilization as it was.  The only city near here was that of the Gnomes, Ak'Anon, and they were not the hunting type.

Dying has always had its drawbacks. 
<br><br>
I learned the hard way on a fateful day recently when I emerged into the world of EverQuest anticipating some fine hunting with a few friends. I had hoped to gather them for the purpose of ridding the barren, haunted plains of Western Karanas of that damned plague of giant spiders that has been crawling around harassing the natives recently.

As I was wandring to and fro, I spied a soaring sight,<br>
A wood elf maid with hair of gold engage-ed in a fight.<br>
A Deathfist Foot, its lips snarled back, did press her hard and fast,<br>
And brave, brave Ambi showed no lack with sword in her hands clasped.<br>
On hillside did the swords ring high-- Foot massive, Ambi small,<br>
But, oh, her smalling frame was spry, and blow by blow did fall.<br>
<em>Ambi elf, your soul is brave! Your spirit made of fire.<br>
You did not run, nor ground you gave as you leapt into death's pyre.</em>

<em>It has been over twenty years since the young Leif was thrown into the flames of mourning by the passing of his master Brendelson. He wanders without a cause hoping that one day he will be able to rid himself of the grief he feels. He has seen much of Norrath, gaining knowledge and experience in his travels. Despite his travels and encounters he has only acquired three true friends. Tieon, a young female elf, adept in the ways of the paladin, Yeoul, a large troll with, surprisingly, a heart of gold, and Frok, a mischievous, rogue halfling, who gets in more trouble than he's worth. None of Leif's friend know his true past and are not brave enough to ask.</em>

Overhead, the stars glittered across the night sky like a mural made of a million flickering candles. The artist, identity unknown, had woven intricate patterns into his work, stringing the stars along in various shapes and forms: the bear, the serpent, the wolf, and so on. The ancient elven mystics named them constellations and recorded their movements across the great obsidian stage above. For these ancient ones, the patterns offered much wisdom and foretold events great and small.  And while that age had passed centuries ago, much of the old wisdom was passed down through generations and across oceans. There were still a few magus across Norrath who could gaze up and read the signs, though their numbers dwindled every year.

  In Halas, at my favorite tavern, and sitting at a largest table, I can often be found telling stories to my fellow brothers, while eating bread and drinking.  Today was no different than any other.

Thank god someone finally spoke up!! I have to admit I myself am a powergamer!
I agree completely, and utterly with Jeff Olmstead. I have been wishing to say
that for the past several months when people constantly insult us..But I did
not know how to phrase it..You know? Well, Jeff did not leave his email
address in the article that he wrote, otherwise I would have sent it to him as

<em>How can you make sure that the game does not quickly become polarized, having more evil characters or people playing a character in a rude, selfish, and or obnoxious way all the time. In UO, it was silly. There were no "GOOD" people.

	Swirls of shadows formed in the underground room beside Meldrath.  As they coalesced, two pinpricks of light formed within the darkening form about to take shape.  A brooding presence added to the already menacing bulk of shadow that became the messenger Meldrath desired.  As the small light of the eyes gradually grew, an unearthly blue-red shimmer gave the impression of a slumbering intellect, wakened but not aroused.
