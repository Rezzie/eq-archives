The small, clumsy ship scudded along before the breeze, travelling along the sandy shore of the Desert of Ro.  The stars above reflected in the waters of the Ocean of Tears, giving the illusion of endless sky and making the Orcs in the ship very uncomfortable.

It was cool inside the hollow of the Great Tree.  Druids lined the walls, casting spells and talking quietly, a few with shaggy wolves panting amiably at their feet.  The ceiling rose up into the tree, disappearing  into darkness over Aklar's head.  The sap of the living tree pulsed in the walls, a flickering light that filled the place with a soft wavering glow.  As always, when she came here, Aklar could feel the harmony of nature, the loving gaze of Tunare like a palpable touch on her skin.  Here, it never seemed hard to live in peace, to do no harm.  Here, she could remember what it had felt like the first time she heard the Tunare's call, that soft surging like the wind, like tree sap in spring, like the flow of a stream over rounded pebbles.   It was impossible not to feel humbled and awed.

   Jim looked over his shoulder to see his wife running up the stairs.  They had both had a hard day at work and needed to let off some frustration.  
<br><br>
"Hey wait up" she said was she climbed the last stair to reach him.   "You know I can't run that fast."

Six giants roamed the western commons<br>
Wreaking fear and wrath.<br>
Till a mage named Garreth<br>
Stepped clear into one's path.<br>
Garreth summoned fiery doom<br>
Wrought from Solusek Ro,<br>
And into burning ashes<br>
Did he flame the larger foe.

Kelethin had always been quiet this time of the year. The
Crushbone orcs would stop their raids for their ritualistic
autumn ceremonies. The forest and the elves were at peace for a
short time. It was during this safe part of the year that the
Soldiers of Tunare would spend most of their time researching the
nature that surrounded them. Young apprentices learned more from
their mentors, and the more skilled druids would take the time to
research new spells to keep Kelethin and the Faydark safe.

Ohaobol, deciding his rest time was over, picked up his poor attempt at setting a camp and continued on with his journey through the Feerrott. His sense of direction was very poor, so his progress was slow, walking around in circles a lot, and using the same rock as a landmark. This didn't stop him from trying to find a way out of the thick vegetation.

Well, it's been an interesting week.  There have been a few newsworthy items that I want to mention.  The UO lawsuit was settled.  The plaintiffs are dropping their case against EA. As part of that settlement, EA will donate $15,000 to the <a herf="http://www.thetech.org/">San Jose Tech Museum</a>.  You know what, I no longer care whether or not the lawsuit was a good thing.  And heck, with a result like this, I doubt that it will have much impact on EA, much less on the entire industry.

	When I read about the PK situation in UO and the complaints of role-players and those who want to be able to enjoy the game without fear of rampant killing, I also remember that those who are true PvP warriors are not those who run around killing newbies, they are the mighty bunch who relish a challenge only provided by defeating a human opponent.  Running around <a href=http://www.pk-hq.com/> PK-HQ</a>, I found there are varying levels of feeling on that, ranging from a "survival of the fittest take no prisoners and kill anyone around you" mindset to hard core Role-playing PK's.

The Travelers Tales were I believe one of the best things about this
newspaper! I have read all the stories but none have kept me coming back
waiting on the edge for the next issue. I really have to hand it to
Ozymandius they are great stories. I find myself now sitting in the
middle of the week thinking about what will happen next to Winter,
Maclir, Ozy, and the rest of the gang. Each tale has kept me in great
suspense. Each time you think you know what will happen there is a new
twist and you go back to guessing.

Ok, I'm not asking for any serious spoilers here or anything, but I would 
like some information on a topic that I have found to be previously untouched 
by people.  I was wondering about the noteriety (or whatever its called in EQ) 
system in EverQuest.  Just some basic details, like some titles, or causes to 
change reputation, and stuff like that.  That is, if there is a system like 
that implemented in the game yet.  Thanks in advance for responding!</em>
