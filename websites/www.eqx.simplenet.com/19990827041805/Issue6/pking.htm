<big><b>D</b></big>ach seems to think one cannot have too much PK control.  No offense
intended, I disagree.  As Brad and many gamers have stated on many occasions, the focus here is
adventuring.  Things need to be set up so players don't <u>want</u> to PKill.  Now look,
you're making me quote Anne McCaffrey =P   In her books, there was no
crime and or warring because the threat was too much to worry about already.
AT LEAST NEAR THE BEGINNING, THEIR SHOULD BE A NEARLY INDOMITABLE CHALLENGE THAT WILL
UNITE THE PLAYERS.   That's the premise in many games today.  The world is going to be destroyed
by EvilForce, so all warring sides band together to fight for their own existence.  
Also, PKilling is a product of boredom.  I am against making towns a big element of the game;
they are one of the major causes of boredom.  One should never should too long in towns.  Look
back to your roots, people.  What did you have fun playing?

Think of Final Fantasy, Dragon Warrior, Landstalker, Alundra...  it goes
on.    These games kept the straight up towns to a minimum.  Most of your
time was spent in dungeons.  Epecially in the Landstalker and Alundra games.
Now those kept us in the dungeons, adventuring, thinking and actually *gasp*
using our brains for many hours on end.  That was fun.  I hope the EverQuest
team takes a look at these awesome RPG adventures somewhere in their travels.
<br><br>
Back to community.   Look to "The Realm" and "Ultima Online".   They sought to
keep players coming back by establishing "online communities".  In this I think they
failed miserably, and was their primary failing that lead to this breadbaking 
and suchaught.   It was so contrived, it just wasn't fun.   What really brings
people together is the adventure aspect.  If the design teams would just go back
to basics and concentrate on making the actual ADVENTURE fun, they would find 
the online community they had hoped to create in the first place sprouting up under
their noses.

After all, isn't that what draws us all in the first place?  Save the mystical
MagicLand from destruction! We need your help! Quite simply, as Quest for Glory
(Sierra) put it, "Wanted:  A hero."  That the premise for the game.  That was 
the goal;  to save the MagicLand.    Not bake bread.
<br><br>
Dach, Ai'm wit'ya baby.  The quality of the adventure is everything.
<br><br>
Now, if a such a truly awesome adventure exists, people won't WANT to pkill.
They'll be an adventure that's far better.  Summation: 
PKILLING IS A SYMPTOM OF A POOR GAME.  TRUE COMMUNITY IS CREATED IN THE FACE OF
CHALLENGE AND ADVENTURE AND <u>FUN</u>.
