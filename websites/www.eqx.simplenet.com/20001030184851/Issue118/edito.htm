  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
    thing I wanted to address on my topic of Norrath evolution was what is already 
    out there and exists. It would be remiss of me to state that Verant is doing 
    nothing as far as historical background, because they are doing a lot, and 
    adding quests all the time. I’d like to bring your attention to a thread on 
    EQSS called <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/forums/showthreaded.pl?Cat=7&Board=eqwestwood&Number=17473&Search=true&Forum=eqwestwood&Words=Norrathian%20Mythology&Match=Entire%20Phrase&Searchpage=0&Limit=25&Old=1month">Norrathian 
    Mythology</a>. In it, many players contributed what they have gleaned from 
    in the game, discussions with GM’s, and from experiences in Beta. It's not 
    official, but it’s an awesome compilation of information, and I hope we will 
    be able to organize it in some way and present it to you. Take a second to 
    look through it, (or more than a second, it’s rather long) and then come back.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    I’m going to change my stance on information like this being available in 
    only game, because I think that this information is not being found enough 
    in game, or not being found in the correct way. There are too many people 
    willing to trot through quests and post the bare minimum and spoil it for 
    others, and not enough folks who find the lore and study it. Does this mean 
    that the spoilers miss out? Yep, and it means we all miss out. This is fascinating 
    stuff! It shows many directions to go with multiple story lines. We all know 
    there is something called a Ring of Scale, but what does it do? Who are they? 
    What is their goal, and what does that mean to us? I also like how that thread 
    contained conflicting facts, such as the origin of dark elves and Innoruuk’s 
    relationship to elves. Rebel elf factions? WOW. The high elves, those snooty 
    palefaces, are actually rebels? Bill Trost mentioned that vagueness specifically 
    in <a href=../Issue105/letters.htm>his letter to us</a> in Issue 105 - how 
    important conflicting stories are, and how they add depth to the history.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    EQ is focused on items and classes right now. For a while, it was necessary. 
    Class balance is essential, it will make or break a game. The fact that there 
    is no dominant race/class combination chosen by gamers means that the game’s 
    balance is essentially finished by now, with minor tweaks needed every once 
    and a while. (I believe this strongly, so responses to this statement will 
    be ignored. If you have a complaint about your class, don’t bring it to me. 
    )</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Now it’s time to refocus. Pull some of those item creators and balance wizards 
    out and take a look at how to take the storylines that exist and turn them 
    into history. Kunark is a sweeping change in what is available to players, 
    and I hope that the impact of a new land is not only felt on Kunark itself. 
    Perhaps a new port will open on Antonica? Let’s not have an immutable history, 
    unchanging, but a story, which sweeps us into an evolving world and leaves 
    us enthralled once again with the tapestry that is Norrathian history.</font></p>
