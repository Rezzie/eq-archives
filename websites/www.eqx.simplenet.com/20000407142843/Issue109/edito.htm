I've been reading the boards again, and reading the posts by Abashi in response to players' questions.  First of all, I want to commend Verant for hiring Abashi and giving him the discretion to comment and respond to players concerns.  He is doing an excellent job, and I hope he is here with us for a long time.  If you get a chance, check out EQSS or EQV and look at what he has been saying, and the questions your fellow players have been asking.
<br><br>
There was a long letter this week written by a player who played a paladin while his wife played a ranger.  He had done an excellent analysis of AC and damage potential of both classes across their levels to support the argument that paladins were under-powered in combat, and he made some very good points, analyzing the skills caps for paladins and rangers and examining the effect of having dual wield and double attack for the rangers vs the paladin's double attack only.  His numbers were good, and had the desired effect of making me believe that paladins were not as good in melee as rangers.  Neither class is one I have played above 20th level, so I can't pretend to be an expert on it.  But I felt there was something missing.
<br><br>
What was missing? The author didn't write about the feel of being a paladin, or the feel of being a ranger.  Nowhere was there a mention of a paladin's holiness or a rangers love of nature.  I'm not one who chooses my class on what I want them to do as much as who they are, and the blizzard of numbers sort of depressed me.  Why do you choose <b>your</b> class?  The boards seem to show that druids are one of the most popular classes because they are the most "powerful" - but I doubt that.  I think druids have certain advantages over other classes (Spirit of Wolf being one of the main things, along with travel spells) but they take some hits in armor class, and weapon choices, and …
<br><br>
And that's exactly how I don't choose my class.  I chose Oghma in part because of who I saw him as (a dwarven repository of culture and history) and how I like to play - a helping class.  Oghma is a dwarven cleric because of who he is and not because he has a high starting strength for a cleric.  I chose Posy because the idea of a little gnome female tossing around fire and lightning was irresistible to me, and it still is.  Fighting the giant aviak guards at a height of two and a half feet is an experience not to be missed.  You can look right up their kilts and... er never mind. But you know what I mean.
<br><br>
I know it's important to have players who love the statistics and look at ac and damage per round and comparisons of magical items available by class and race - but I can't help but think they are missing the point.  If you want to do math, what are you doing in a fantasy world?  Do you gaze in wonder at the sunrise over the Flame Tower Island in Lake Rathe?  Do you find yourself distracted in battle because you chose a long camera view and can't believe how awesome the various spells and attacks look from afar?
<br><br>
Why are you playing? Are you convinced that your character will become an Uber-tank after you get that one magic weapon, and without it the character is worthless? Are you spending time arguing at camp spots over who should get more of the spawns and why?  Exactly how horrible is it to give up a camp spot and maybe get a ¼ bar less experience that day? Did you pick your race because of their stats or their outlook on life?
<br><br>
The more I play the more I am convinced that I am not a temporary visitor to Norrath. I can see myself playing EverQuest next year at this time. I hope Oghma and Posy will both be 50th level, but if they aren't, I will still love them for who they are and where they've been, and who they have met along the way.
<br><br>
Watch a sunrise.  Believe that all Paladins are good, and all rangers love nature.  Feel nervous around dark elves, for they are treacherous. Watch your purse near a halfling, and tease a dwarf - they take it so well.  Bonk gnomes on the head if they mouth off to you, and above all, <b>play</b>.  Keep your sense of wonder. /gasp when Norrath astounds you.
