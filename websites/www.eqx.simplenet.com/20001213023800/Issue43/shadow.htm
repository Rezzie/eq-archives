Brammin sat up sharply, and glanced at his surroundings. The mysterious room he was in soon laid down an air of recognition. He stood up and glanced out the window. The magnificent rooftops of the high city of Erudin sprouted upwards, vying for their positions in the bright sky. The shallow sun floated merrily above the city, streaking warmth and providing light.
<br><br>
As his conscious thought washed away his sleepiness, Brammin realized he had much work to do. He quickly got dressed and prepared for the day ahead. He slipped on a comfortable brown robe and hurried to the door and out of his room. He stepped into a small corridor that was flanked by a staircase. He ran through his head the floor plan of the tower, then walked downstairs.
<br><br>
The stairs wound around the interior wall of the tower, as was typical of mage towers. Brammin arrived at the second floor, and opened a large, extravagant door. He stepped in the room and was filled with a potent feeling of excitement.
<br><br>
The large room spanned the second and the third floors. Books stacked up the wall, lined up erratically on shelf upon shelf. Their colors carried the whole rainbow, and their content the whole universe. A nearby table had a large stack of books on it. One of the books was open, its fresh ink and crisp pages contrasting to the pile of decayed books by it. A quill and inkwell sat nearby, waiting for their next composer. Nearby a large window overlooked the city. Looking up he saw the above catwalk that clung to the wall of the second floor, countless more books asking to be studied.
<br><br>
<em>Where is she?</em> Brammin thought. He was surprised that she hadn't awakened yet. Dismissing the thought, he walked over to the desk. As he walked the light layer of dust that hung in the air parted as if to grant him passage to his destination. Most disliked the smell of dust, to Brammin it was the smell of enlightenment and learning.
<br><br>
He stood by the desk for a minute, half waiting for her to walk in. After waiting for a minute, he surrendered and sat down. He picked up the quill and opened a nearby book. He began the slow process of decoding the ancient pages. The youthful book thirsted for the knowledge that the other contained, and eagerly accepted the cool ink on it.
<br><br>
The door slammed and Brammin jumped up. He looked over and saw her. Her robes flowed gracefully onto the ground. Her eyes were bright with genius, her dark brown blue skin shined in the daylight. Her sandy hair fell about her shoulders, partially hidden by the helmet she wore. She glared at him and spoke.
<br><br>
"Finally you have awakened, don't allow me to halt your work," her voice was that of an angel's. She took off the robe, underneath she wore colorful attire. He nodded and sat back down. She took leave of the room. She spoke again, "I must leave now. Farewell."
<br><br>
Brammin continued his work. As he worked his mind wandered elsewhere. It had taken an eternity to scribe this book, but he would be finished by today. He so eagerly wanted to be a spellcaster, like his master was. She had told him that, because he was human he could never reach the full potential, but he so wanted to learn.
<br><br>
The scribing stretched on for hours but Brammin never ceased to work. He wrote carefully into the new book. It was hard work for him to scribe in languages he didn't understand. He knew how to write in Erudite, but the books she had him scribe the last few months were foreign to him. He finally transferred the last sentence, and smiled triumphantly. She had promised him that it was the last book in a foreign language that he would have to scribe.
<br><br>
He decided to take a break. He deserved it, or at least that is how he justified it. After staring out the window for a while, he leaned back in the chair and put his feet on the desk. He smiled a relaxed smile, rest was rare to him. He shifted his feet slightly on the desk, trying to get more comfortable.
<br><br>
Then his foot brushed up against the ink well. It tipped over and spilled its expensive contents on the table. Brammin jumped up. He had no idea what to do first. He put the ink well back up and hurried to push the old pile of books aside, but knocked a couple of old books he had finished scribing off the table. They broke on the ground, their ancient pages succumbing to age. He moved the new books out of the way of the expanding lake of ink. If she found out he did this he would be in deep trouble, he knew that. She was down to the last straw with him.
<br><br>
Not wanting to lose his apprenticeship he knew he must conceal the foolish events that had just transpired. He first disposed of the ink well. Then he set to the tedious process of  cleaning up the ink spill. First he had to get a bucket of water at the nearby well. Then he had to get a cloth and dig out the old soap. After he finished cleaning up the ink, he moved the books to let the table dry and removed the remains of the broken ones.
<br><br>
Brammin carelessly picked up the newly scribed book by its pages, and heard the most dreaded thing that could enter an apprentice scribe's ears, a tear. The book clattered to the floor, parts of torn pages resting in his hand. Brammin let out a cry of frustration.
<br><br>
Swiftly thinking of what to do, he went off to find the Pasa Bark. The Pasa Bark is a sappy substance used to bind pages. He had hardly ever had to use it, except when he first arrived in her tower. He walked over to a nearby shelf and shuffled through some flasks containing a variety of liquids. He reached the bottle labeled Pasa bark and sighed, it was empty. 
<br><br>
Now Brammin was lost, she would expel him from her tower if she found out. He had worked so much and he couldn't let it happen. She would most probably be back in a few hours, so he had plenty of time to figure a way through his dilemma.
<br><br>
Brammin walked over and sat back down at the desk. He had no money, and didn't know where he could buy Pasa Bark anyway. It was one of the many strange things she possessed, and he knew not where she got it.
<br><br>
<em>What other place might have Pasa Bark?</em> Brammin wondered. <em>Hmm, books.</em> All of a sudden it became obvious to him. He left immediately, taking with him the book.
<br><br>
He stepped out on the clear streets of Erudin, the tiled ground stretching on into the distance. Various brightly clad people walked about, each with their own destinations. The city itself was elaborate and abstract, as was the way of the Erudites. Brammin had trouble navigating the town, for its' streets twisted about the buildings. The region was beautiful and the town was a work of art in itself.
<br><br>
He usually appreciated the opportunity to get out of the tower, to breathe in the fresh air of Erudin. But today it was different, he was rushed and serious. Finally he made his way to the large building which was his destination, the Library of Erudin.
<br><br>
Glancing around as if to make sure she hadn't followed him, he entered. Inside the beautiful building lay the ultimate library. Nearby a clerk sat looking through some books.  He seemed to ignore Brammin intentionally, as opposed to offering help. Brammin usually faced light prejudice but it was no matter to him now. He stood in awe, looking up to the second floor, and down at the first. He finally remembered his purpose and walked up to the clerk.
<br><br>
"Excuse me . . ." Brammin said in heavily accented Erudite.
<br><br>
"Yes?" The clerk looked up, as if first noticing him.
<br><br>
"Do you have any Pasa Bark I could use?" Brammin asked, pleading slightly.
<br><br>
"For you?  It's very expensive." The clerk replied.
<br><br>
"Hear me out. I just finished this book I've been working on scribing forever, it is very important. Only a few pages came out of it." Brammin begged.
<br><br>
"I suppose, yet only once." The clerk said.
<br><br>
The clerk reached out and took the book and the fallen pages. He reached under his desk and produced some Pasa Bark. He opened the book slowly, as he was accustomed to with books. Brammin knew it was to not break the binding. The clerks' eyes opened wide at the sight of the book.
<br><br>
"I'll, return soon. Don't move!" The clerk demanded.
<br><br>
Mystified, Brammin complied. He was used to being ordered around. He was happy that he had solved the problem on his own. It made him feel proud. She would be none the wiser to what had happened today and he would still have his apprenticeship.
<br><br>
A few minutes later the clerk returned, but accompanying him was an old man who looked angered. The man walked up to him, his deep brown eyes meeting Brammin's.
<br><br>
"Where did this . . . Book . . . Come from?" the man demanded.
<br><br>
"It's mine. Partially, well I just finished it," Brammin replied, proudly.
<br><br>
"You . . . Finished it?!" the man seemed disgusted.
<br><br>
"Yes, is there a problem?" Brammin replied, confused.
<br><br>
"Wait here!" the clerk ordered then he left the building in a hurry, and the old man began studying over the book.  He looked over the pages, his motions carried a demeanor of hatred. He finally shut the book, and looked up at Brammin.
<br><br>
Brammin was entirely confused. The man walked away, and Brammin watched as he left. Brammin started applying Pasa bark to the pages, mending what he had so foolishly undone. A while later he saw the clerk walking down the street with a couple guards. Brammin let out a startled yelp and grabbed the book.
<br><br>
He ran out the entrance of the library and saw the clerk point at him and shout. Brammin started to run, but caught his foot on the ground and tripped. The guards tackled him. Brammin coughed, having the wind knocked out of him. They picked him up and dragged him back into the library, setting him down in a chair.
<br><br>
Over the next hour he told them all he knew about the books. He kept asking them what was wrong, but they ignored his pleas. They decided to take him back to the tower to see who this lady was that he told them about.
<br><br>
People stared at Brammin as he was dragged through the streets by the guards. Of course, he knew that was the kind of thing they expected to happen to a human. They arrived at the tower and knocked on it's large door.
<br><br>
She opened it up, and looked startled. Brammin heard them conversing in low tones. She seemed alien now, he could hear her saying things that weren't true. Brammin was deeply afraid. She walked inside and emerged a couple minutes later wearing her cloak and her most prized staff. It was odd she would wear a cloak and carry her staff on such a warm day, Brammin thought. Of course, more important things were going on now.
<br><br>
As they returned to the library the still sun hung high in the air, it began to make its descent for the day. They entered the library and she looked at the book. She shuffled through it and then looked up at the guards.
<br><br>
"I've never seen it before." she said simply.
<br><br>
"What?!" Brammin cried. She had spent hours examining his work. She knew the book almost as well as he. He tried to speak but the guard's heavy hand muffled his attempt at speech.
<br><br>
"Well I think it's clear enough what happened here. This young man took advantage of her hospitality. He used it as a cover for his examining of the . . . Dark arts." the clerk said this with a tone of spite. Brammin yelled at this. They were all lies! Why would she betray him, why did she lie to the guards.
<br><br>
"I'll take the task of ridding Erudin of it. I am partially responsible for being so ignorant to this." she turned and hunched over the book. Out of the corner of his eye Brammin saw her pull out a book from beneath her robe.
<br><br>
The ripping sound resonated in his ears, and ancient papers fluttered to the floor. She looked happy with herself, and glanced at him. The glance was her goodbye, for his years of service. The guards told her she was free to leave. He knew his own fate. It was all clear to him now.
<br><br>
As she left the building he watched her. Her eyes would never meet his again. She threw off her robe and he saw the book strapped to her back. She pulled out a torch, struck some kindling, and lit it. She readied the torch as if to prepare for her journey.
<br><br>
In the distance he saw her remove her helmet. He saw long, slender ears emerge. Ears typical of the elves. He could barely hear the opening of the book, the cracking of a fresh book being opened.
