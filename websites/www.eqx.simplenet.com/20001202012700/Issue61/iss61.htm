A voice.  A voice in the darkness, speaking her name...Aklar fled that sound, fled the two familiar syllables, drawn out and grotesque on that tongue.  She fell into the dark, deeper, seeking light, seeking hope...
<br><br>
Blue light invaded her mind, a thousand needles pricking her skin, drawing her back to the surface. She broke through, emerged into consciousness.

<P>What is religion?  One can say that religion is the organized structure of worship.  A religion in that sense would include the hierarchy of the priesthood, the rituals and sacred texts, the edifices in which worship took place, and the lay worshippers.  It does not, however, speak about the purpose behind all that structure.  Why do people worship?  Why are there priesthoods and churches and odd rituals that appear quasi-magical in nature?</P>

Russell did a <a href="../Issue59/definition.htm">sum up</a> on what roleplaying was.  Now let's look at why it's so impossible to do, or why more gaming companies don't try to honestly achieve it.

<b>Money</b>
<br><br>
If I can quote one game, I can quote them all.  They are out for money and the developer is out to see his dream.  The developer's dream discussion another time.  But let's really look at the market and it's history.

The tale you are about to hear is not my own, nor in truth that of any friend of mine, it is a tale I heard once a long while ago while I was still plying my wares along the old trade routes between Qeynos and the mountains of Rathe.  
<br><br> 
It was a crisp autumn day and I still had a full cart and at least three weeks on the road to look forward to when I happened by a small town that looked as if it was on its last legs or just beginning to walk.  Rather than spend another wretched night camping along side the road I decided to call my day early and spend the night here.  It was with no difficulty that I determined the Tavern to be the moderate sized building next to the town's well<b>...</b>

	EverQuest is going to be a great social game. Because of the differences in 
communications, it will be much more social then UO ever was. Meridian 59 was very 
social and although EQ's  shout and ooc channels are not as global as the broadcast in 
M59, it will be much more effective in helping people to get to know more people then 
nothing at all.

And so it begins anew.
<br><br>
Chat boards are flooded.  Newsgroups overflow.  The torrent of questions just keeps coming, and there is no damn large enough or sturdy enough to withstand the pressure.  All across our community our thoughts and comments, our hopes and dreams, are being drown.  Several net citizens have gone missing.  Though hopes are high for their recovery, no search for them can be made until after the flood recedes and the skies clear.  And until then most of us are heading for higher ground, though even those places are starting to leak.

I have been a fantasy fan of things like Tolkein and Jordon, etc.  Coming from a limited fantasy background then, I don't have a basis by which to Role Play a Dark Elf, or Drow but they seem interesting.  Maybe a description of these "evil" creatures and hints about RPing them?</em>
