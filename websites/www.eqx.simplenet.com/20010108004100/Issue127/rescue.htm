  Rescue</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Igag 
  woke wearily in a place vaguely familiar, his sword lying in front of him on 
  the ground. As he grabbed his sword and felt the comfort of its grip, he saw 
  the bottles of kalish, mead, ale, brandy and wine line one wall behind a counter. 
  He knew he was in a familiar place&#133; except&#133; a strange red haze was 
  everywhere. The air was putrid as he gasped for a breath. He grabbed a bottle 
  of Brandy and took a swig when he heard strange sounds behind him, he turned 
  suddenly and thrust his sword totally by instinct. It was just in time as his 
  blade went deep into the belly of a goblin wizard. After taking another drink 
  of brandy and cleaning his blade with a mug of ale and a rag from the bar, he 
  remembered where he was and what he was doing there. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
  few months ago, Igag and his wife Laldaena had been in the Mountains of Rathe 
  on a hunting expedition with some friends and fellow adventurers, Askaria, Jalladar 
  and Avidon among others. They had been hunting Giants for the honor of the tribunal, 
  but this is another story. His friends had mentioned in passing that they had 
  heard of some Goblins that made their home in some fiery caves in a place called 
  Lavastorm and they had planned to venture there. Igag bid them good fortune 
  and hoped to meet up with them again.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
  a brief stint in the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule, Igag and his holy wife Laldaena 
  ventured to Freeport for some R&amp;R and to replenish their supplies as well 
  as knock back several ales in the local pubs. One morning after a hearty breakfast 
  Laldaena and Igag ventured out to the East Commons to sell the rare items they 
  had gotten on their journeys to the collectors that seemed to frequent there, 
  when suddenly a hand grasped at Igag&#146;s arm&#133; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
  was Jalladar, a fine barbarian warrior. He was stripped to his loincloth and 
  was without any weapons other than his fists and in obvious pain. While Laldaena 
  called upon the spirits to help the poor lad, Igag demanded answers to what 
  had happened to him.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Gah.. 
  Gah&#133; Gobbys Igag! Gobbys&#133; Avidon! Askaria!&#133; Gobbys!&#148; he 
  sputtered. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Igag 
  shouted.&#147;WHERE ARE ASKARIA AND AVIDON NOW?!&#148; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Igag! 
  Let him be! He needs rest!&#148; Laldaena demanded.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Give 
  the boy some Ale and he will be fine woman!&#148; Igag responded</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Go 
  drink some Ale then and let me tend to him! By the Hammers, you are so stubborn 
  sometimes!&#148; said Laldaena.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Igag 
  grumbled to her about the others, but it was no use and he knew it. She was 
  a holy shaman and a woman, let alone his wife. He knew that arguments with her 
  were futile, especially when someone needed healing. So many times had he argued 
  with her about tending to the wounded Trolls and Ogres that they had seen in 
  the travels to the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule and lost. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
  a few days of rest and the healing from the holy, Jalladar was ready to speak. 
  He told Igag and Laldaena of their adventures into the lair of the Goblins and 
  how they had become captured and incapacitated. They had stripped him and the 
  others of all their gear and were preparing them for some sort of sacrifice 
  to something called Nagafen. Jalladar said this is what Askaria had told him, 
  she was a holy also and had learned a bit of the gobbyspeak from hunting the 
  caves of permafrost. Jalladar managed to escape with help from the warrior named 
  as Avidon. Avidon instructed Jalladar to find help while he stayed to try and 
  keep Askaria from harm. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
  Jalladar was far from being ready to venture back to this vile place but he 
  insisted in going along as Igag prepared for the journey. Laldaena pleaded with 
  Igag to gather a party to free their friends, but Igag insisted there was no 
  time. He had dealt with many goblins in the past and knew he would be extremely 
  lucky if his friends were still alive. Laldaena conceded to her husband as she 
  could tell when his stubborn mind was made up, and she too knew that time was 
  of the essence as she also knew the horrible ways of the gobbys. Arming Jalladar 
  with the equipment they could, the three set off to Lavastorm with Jalladar 
  as their guide. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laldaena 
  called upon the gods for assistance in the journey. Giving them great speed 
  they made it through the Home of the dark elves and to the entrance of the cave 
  in Lavastorm in less than a day. As they prepared to enter the caves Igag gave 
  specific instructions to both Jalladar and Laldaena. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Once 
  we get to where they are holding Avidon and Askaria they will surely know of 
  our presence. These gobbys tend to run for help instead of standing and fighting. 
  Their strength is in their numbers. We cannot take a stand until we have Avidon 
  and Askaria out and equipped. We will find them first then their equipment and 
  make our retreat for regrouping. We cannot fail to get them out&#133; we can 
  always come back for the equipment or even buy them new. So that said&#133; 
  listen to me, if I say run&#133; you run. I will be right behind you. Now take 
  some Ale, it will clear your mind and give your steel strength.&#148;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Igag 
  felt as if this were his chance to prove himself to the Tribunal. A true warriors 
  heart with a plan of action. He would save his friends and vanquish his enemy 
  with one swing. He was truly sure that it was his destiny. With this in mind 
  the three entered the caves. A thick red haze was everywhere as lava poured 
  from crevices everywhere. Small bridges built over flowing rivers of lava, the 
  heat and stench was almost unbearable. Igag thought to himself about how strong 
  a race had to be able to survive such extremes as the freezing cold of Permafrost 
  and the blazing heat of this forsaken place. He truly had respect for them in 
  their strength. As they followed Jalladar deeper and deeper into the caves, 
  avoiding patrols and killing sentries swiftly and quietly when needed, making 
  as little noise as possible wanting not to be discovered, they came across a 
  holy man named Yenen. Yenen, a High Elf cleric, recognized Jalladar right off. 
  Turned out that Yenen was a part of the party that was captured. He was one 
  of two that was able to avoid capture, the other had disappeared. Yenen had 
  spent the last week cowering around avoiding patrols trying to formulate a safe 
  plan to rescue the three captured adventurers. He was very happy to see that 
  Jalladar was still alive as he had not seen him in days. Yenen had been keeping 
  track of where the prisoners where being held as well as he could. Turned out 
  Jalladar had escaped while Yenen slept. At least the other two were still alive 
  and Yenen knew where they were. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;They 
  are in the Wizard&#146;s chamber on the far side of the bar&#133;&#148; Yenen 
  told the group. &#147;He is preparing them for a sacrifice it seems&#133; they 
  have been covered in the blood of the gobbys we killed. I have heard rumblings 
  about someone or something named Nagafen. I believe they have put their equipment 
  in a room near there.&#148;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Show 
  me&#148; Igag said to Yenen</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  group, now four, moved inwards and downwards as deftly as possible to where 
  the prisoners were being held. They came to the bar and as Igag peered in through 
  a hole in the door. He saw Gobbys drinking and celebrating like he had never 
  seen before. Seemed as though something big was going to happen. A sinking feeling 
  came over Igag as he felt it had something to do with his friends&#133; Yenen 
  motioned them to follow him around the bar too a back room. They had found them!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 
  quickly undid the restraints on both Askaria and Avidon. They were both badly 
  beaten and were in dire need of help. Laldaena and Yenen did what they could 
  right away but they needed time and someplace safe to get it done correctly. 
  Igag told them to get out as fast as they could&#133; he and Jalladar would 
  find the equipment and be out soon.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yenen, 
  Laldaena, Avidon and Askaria all rushed quietly and safely to the exit of the 
  caves while Jalladar and Igag searched for the equipment. Room after room they 
  searched, avoiding the bar as all those Gobbys were there. When Igag realized 
  that would be exactly where they would be&#133; like trophies from a hunt&#133; 
  like the mammoth heads and leopard heads that lined his own hometown bar. He 
  would have to get them out of there, but how? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Suddenly 
  the gobbys were yelling and screaming&#133; evidently they had found out that 
  the prisoners had escaped. Igag knew at this point they would be leaving the 
  bar. This was their chance. He and Jalladar would have to stay where they were 
  hidden until the right time when they could dart over to the bar and grab the 
  equipment then get out. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  time was at hand. Igag saw ten, perhaps fifteen, gobbys rush past away from 
  the bar&#133; this was the moment they had been waiting for. He and Jalladar 
  rushed into the bar. They found the equipment just like he had thought&#133; 
  mounted like trophies. They got the gear down and got Jalladar equipped. They 
  gathered Askaria and Avidon&#146;s gear, Jalladar with weapons and armor, Igag 
  with the supplies. Igag grabbed a bottle of brandy and took a swig... when he 
  was struck from behind, his sword and the brandy tumbling to the floor in front 
  of him. Before Igag fell into unconsciousness he yelled for Jalladar to run 
  to the others, protect them, he turned to look at his attacker and saw a young 
  goblin with a club standing over him.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Ahhh, 
  the wizard and Nagafen will be pleased I got you. Don&#146;t worry, after I 
  tell the wizard about you I will get your friend then the prisoners you helped 
  to escape. They think I am a kid but this will show them I am worthy.&#148;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Igag 
  woke wearily in a place vaguely familiar, his sword lying in front of him on 
  the ground. As he grabbed his sword and felt the comfort of its grip, he saw 
  the bottles of kalish, mead, ale, brandy and wine line one wall behind a counter. 
  He knew he was in a familiar place&#133; except&#133; a strange red haze was 
  everywhere. The air was putrid as he gasped for a breath. He grabbed a bottle 
  of Brandy and took a swig when he heard strange sounds behind him, he turned 
  suddenly and thrust his sword totally by instinct. It was just in time as his 
  blade went deep into the belly of a goblin wizard. After taking another drink 
  of brandy and cleaning his blade with a mug of ale and a rag from the bar, he 
  remembered where he was and what he was doing there. He turned to the exit, 
  hoping Jalladar had made it out. He opened the door to find more gobbys than 
  he could count. He backed into the room until his back hit the bar. The gobbys 
  fanned out, surrounding him, no escape. He would not be a sacrifice to this 
  so-called Nagafen! He would fight until the last drop of blood pumped from his 
  warrior&#146;s heart! </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I 
  AM IGAG! BARBARIAN SON OF HALAS! FEEL MY STEEL AND MEET THY MAKER!&#148; Igag 
  roared.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
  first two swipes of his blade were lucky ones, the first decapitating a goblin 
  the next penetrating deep into the chest of another. Two fatal blows. A brief 
  remembrance of his father, Igag thanked him for the training. Igag then stumbled 
  as he felt a blade hit him on his shoulder, taking a nice chunk of his armor 
  away and exposing a bleeding arm. It was far from a fatal blow but enough for 
  Igag to realize death was not far. His only solace would be as many of these 
  foul beasts as he could take with him to the grave.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;YOU 
  MAY KILL ME YOU BASTARDS! BUT I WILL DO MY DAMAGE! FOR THE GLORY OF THE TRIBUNAL 
  YOUR BLOOD WILL STAIN MY BLADE! HANG THAT IN YOUR TROPHY ROOM!&#148;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Slamming 
  a gobby with a forearm to the face, knocking him unconscious, then slamming 
  his sword into his skull was kill number four, and five came on a riposte as 
  a gobby left his sword wide and an open backside which Igag took full advantage 
  of... lunging his blade into the gobby&#146;s kidney area. This was unfortunate 
  at the same time as Igag was left vulnerable and a gobby shaman clubbed him 
  to the head, taking Igag to the ground. They swarmed at this point, surrounding 
  him&#133; pummeling him with their fists and kicks to the face and body. No 
  they did not want him dead&#133; they wanted him for sacrifice. Igag fought 
  off the darkness that was surrounding him, he felt nothing but numbness. His 
  ears were ringing and everything flashed white. He opened his eyes one last 
  time&#133; he saw the goblins we no long pummeling him. He saw a flash of blue 
  from the corner of his eye. His wounds began to heal&#133; he felt much better. 
  IT WAS HIS HOLY WIFE! OH MY! Igag cursed her in his mind&#133; &#147;Damn her! 
  I did not want her to have the same fate as me&#133; now she is here&#133;. 
  The Hammers have lead her astray as I don&#146;t have the power to protect her 
  now&#133;&#148; Igag reached for his sword and got up. Blood pouring over his 
  face. A figure had its back turned to him. Igag took a deep drink of brandy 
  and lunged for the figure, only to have his sword stopped by an axe! It was 
  Avidon! He had almost killed one that he had come to save! Swinging his mighty 
  axe back to the battle, Avidon buried it into the leg of a goblin shaman. Too 
  his right Jalladar was kicking a goblin in the head while his axe, swinging 
  wildly, caught another in the midsection. Askaria and Yenen were casting their 
  mighty healing and protective spells over the warriors and Laldaena was healing 
  Igag. Igag washed the blood from his face temporarily with a splash from the 
  Ale on the bar, when he suddenly fell to his knees dropping his sword once more 
  and grasping for his back. Behind him was the wizard. It was not a fatal blow 
  that Igag had dealt, but blood was pouring from the wizard as he removed the 
  dagger from Igag&#146;s back and began to cast. The wizard cast a spell upon 
  Laldaena knocking her back against the wall and rendering her unconscious. Igag, 
  lying in a mixture of his crimson colored blood, the black vicious goblin blood, 
  ale and brandy, saw his holy wife lying across the room, eyes glazed as if dead. 
  Igag felt a surge of anger and power. Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! is the only 
  thing that runs through his mind. Igag looked up to see the wizard standing 
  over him and grabbed his sword once more. The wizard was fast. Seeing that Igag 
  was up and able, he blocked his first swing of the mighty sword. But the first 
  swing was the setup for Igag, as was the second&#133; the third swing was the 
  crippling blow that Igag had learned from his father many moons ago. A high 
  arc starting at his feet to full extension over his head, Igag&#146;s blade 
  went into the wizards skull and stopped just below his waist. Igag fell to his 
  knees and then on his face as Laldaena awoke. She immediately began healing 
  her husband but she was weak as well.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Avidon, 
  Jalladar, Yenen and Askaria quickly dispensed of the remaining goblins and carried 
  Igag and Laldaena safely to the cave entrance. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  people he had come to save had saved him&#133;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
  was supposed to be the chosen one&#133; He was the one to save others&#133; 
  He was the one to bring honor to the Tribunal&#133; Igag had failed in his heart. 
  He had fallen in battle. He should be dead. But the Tribunal did not wish him 
  dead. He may have failed today but there must be something in his future.</font></p>
