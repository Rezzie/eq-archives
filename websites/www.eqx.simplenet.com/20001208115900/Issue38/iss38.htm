Groal awoke to find himself lying on a worn and dirty mattress. A hush of subdued yet insistent voices filtered through his still aching brain but the agony he had felt before had settled down to a dull throb. He sat up and looked about his surroundings. In the dim light of a single large candle he saw a group of ogres sitting around a large table, deep in a heated argument. He sat silently and listened.

"It's time, I tell you. We have waited long enough. With Kinlack and Barbergan dead Thrack will move quickly. We must take action now or never."

<em><b>Part I - They are But Gods</b></em>
<br><br>
They are but Gods, and Gods aren't perfect.  There is no question about that.  The only proof required is to look at Norrath.  How could they treat us this way, they have little mercy and only truly care for themselves and the power that they can exert on their devoted of followers.

Hot red lava boiled up from the open sores in the earth.  The fumes from the burning sulfur tickled my nose.   I paid close attention to my footing, as to not end up a victim to this display of the earth's power.  Each of our party's footsteps made a crunching sound as we walked on the crust of the once hot lava.  We were not very stealthy in our movement.

The winds blew fiercely over the cold, snow covered plains of the
Northlands.  One cold wind would collide with the next and together they would dance away into the night; away from presence of sight.  Their laughter, mocking those unfortunate (or foolish) enough to be wandering the land at such a time, pierced the silence with a sound mistaken by the unlearned as merely howls of the wind.  It was indeed more than that, and in fact not simply laughter, but conversation as well<b>...</b>

	"Yes, my pet. Yes, you'll be all right, just calm down." Brendelson whispered, "It will all right." He reached down and touched the wounded animal, rubbing gently while he evoked a spell of healing. He looked around furiously for any signs of the party. "When I find them…" 
	<br><br>
	"Brendelson?" 
	<br><br>
"What do you want, Leif?" Brendelson said, barely containing his fury.

First off, I wanted to say that I am aware that my last editorial sounded a bit harsh.  I received a few letters and comments telling me just how harsh.  The following short snippet was from Delphaeus, and is pretty typical of what I heard:

I decided to stick with the "EverQuest exp" theme on my first editorial, so bear with me if you cant's stand the pun :).
