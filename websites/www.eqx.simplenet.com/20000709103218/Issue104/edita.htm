Two years...
<br><br>
Dang!
<br><br>
Well, this is my chance to actually sit back and look at what EverQuest Express has been and what it's done over the last two years.  And I have to be bold and say that I'm impressed.  From what started as a bit of a lark on a newsgroup has become a pretty good little publication.  I'm proud to say that if you search the web for EverQuest related sites, you won't find one anywhere like it.
<br><br>
When I finally realized that it was up to me to do something with this publication, I set out to accomplish only a few goals, things that I thought were important.  I wanted to give the community something that they didn't have yet.  Back then, as now, there were plenty of news sites.  You can go to several dozen places to find out what the latest announcement about the game was.  You can go to even more places to engage in a lively and even sometimes intelligent discussion about EverQuest on a web board.  I didn't want to spend any of my time making something that looked like everything else.
<br><br>
And I wanted, more than anything else, for EverQuest to be as close as possible to my pen and paper games.  Sitting over here behind my computer there didn't seem to be a lot that I could do about that.  But there were some things.  I could, like everyone else, make suggestions to the developers.  But I could also try to influence people and hopefully convince them to want what I want.  Making EverQuest into a more complete role-playing game requires role-players.  I wanted to appeal to existing role-players, and maybe show some people that weren't role-players how much fun it is.
<br><br>
And I think we've done that.  I like EQX, and I would read it every week, even if I didn't have to read it every week.
<br><br>
I can sit here at my computer and tell you how wonderful EQX is and not feel at all like I'm bragging.  Folks, it's not me.  All I do here is tap out mindless editorials and cut and past into my HTML editor.  What makes EQX is the staff and the readers that send in their work.  EverQuest Express is lucky to have some of the best minds in a community of great minds.  Every time I think that we've done it all, that there's nothing new or useful for us to do, they come up with something great.
<br><br>
Me, I just ride the wave.  I soak up the praise, and that's where I feel guilty.
<br><br>
So I want to take the chance to thank everyone that's sent us a story or article.  I want to thank the staff, the folks that work so hard every week to make this thing work.  And I'm not forgetting the artists.  When I was trying to choose my favorite thing about EQX for the article this week, I was very tempted to choose some of the art.  Jason Chan comes to mind first, as does Archanalia.   Some of the art that we've had on this site has been of the highest quality.  And touches of real class like that make us look almost professional.  I also want to thank Verant and the folks there for making us feel welcome.  And I want to thank the readers for making it seem like we've done some good and entertained some people.
<br><br>
Hell, I can't wait to see what happens over the next 104 issues...
