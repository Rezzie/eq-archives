Hoi there! Lrets D'pearl here just back from an exhausting undercover report to bring ye he latest in happenings across the lands of Norrath. Me latest investigation bring me to sunny Northern Ro just off the border of fair [coughcough] Freeport. For many weeks denizens of this bustling port town have been trying to discover the source of the strange lights that flash across the skies of Northern Ro. 
<br><br>
The Dean of Freeport Academy of Arcane Science offered this little tidbit of information:
<br><br>
"We have engaged in extensive studies to discover that the lights are being caused by .. uh .... well ...uh ... magic ...uh ... carpets .... yeah, yeah!!! That's the ticket .. uh ... magic carpets ... and the .. uh .... lights ... are caused ...by .... reflections off of ... the .... uh .... stratometric opterometronical ..uh ... doo wahh diddy .... zizgamine emnations when they fly at high altitudes .. yeeeeahhh ... That's the ticket!"
<br><br>
What this means ... we have no idea. Furthermore, we have found that magic carpet zizga whatever you call 'ems are NOT the cause of the lights ... [snort] Just goes to show what mages REALLY know :P. 
<br><br>
No folks, the cause of the light is nothing other than your average everyday pest ... the fire beetle ...

<em><b>(People have wondered what the cause behind the strange lights in the sky above Northern Ro may be... until now)</b></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Yes folks, the lights are caused by nothing other than your average everyday, getting in ye'r corn flakes, fire beetle. Apparently something in the hot air creates a high pressure jet stream of air just strong enough rocket the lil buggers high into the sky ... also explaining why the lights shine in the sky. ALSO explaining why ye can find fire beetle eyes lying all over the desert :). This amazing discovery has caused quite a stir in the local population as can be evidenced by a former mage who once tried to communicate mentally with the lights ..."Damn my eyes but they AREN'T an illusion!"
