<b>Combat</b>
<br><br>
First, you select a target by clicking on it with your mouse.  It displays
your current target on the right margin.  Pressing 'z' will toggle attack
mode.  Now all you need to do is move into range of your target, and combat
will begin.  When fighting woodland monsters such as snakes and bats you
may have to chase them for a short time in order to get close enough to
start combat.  I would like to see that a rear attack gives you a free 
attack round, but currently the monster instantly turns around and fights
back the same round.  Now all you do is sit and watch your HPs to make sure
you don't die.  If you get low, you may have to run back towards the town,
where the guards destroy any monsters that wander too close.  Then after
healing, you can strike out and try a different monster.

There are some combat skills, such as Kick and Bash that give you an extra
attack during combat.  With an external camera, you will be able to see 
your character swing his foot into the monster to kick it.  This means 
there are things you can do during battle, so it is not as boring as it
sounds.

<b>Archery</b>
<br><br>
Bows are pretty expensive, so newbies do not have the chance to try them
out.  But, I was able to get a demonstration of how archery works.  Bows 
do not currently fire in attack mode, which means you need to click to 
shoot an arrow.  I expect this will change.  You do see the arrow fly
through the air, but it is pretty quick.  That means you wont be able to
manually dodge an arrow just by seeing it in time to react.  It will be
based upon your skill at dodging, just like a normal attack.  However, a
moving target is harder to hit.  The better the archer's skill, the better
he will be at leading the target.  I'm guessing that to be safe from archers,
it is best to keep moving side to side and changing directions.
