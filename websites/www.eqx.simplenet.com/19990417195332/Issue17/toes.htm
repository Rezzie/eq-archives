It wasn’t until he had insulted their leader that Fich noticed the odd way they
walked.  It then occurred to him to look down.  Their feet were wrapped, unlike most
of their kind.  He could see at the edges of the cloth that there were indeed
spatters of blood, long ago dried.
<br><br>
They were members of the three-toed clan.  The most feared group of dwellers in this
part of the underneath.  But standing there face to fuzzy face with them it was hard
to imagine why.  Had he not just slain one of them with but a flick of his wrist?

Fich looked back up to their leader.  In his eyes was now a certain amount of
expectancy; In fact, there was a demand for respect there.  This little blue furred
man was thinking that Fich would cower in fear of him because he was one of these
imbeciles who ceremonially cuts off a toe in sacrifice.
<br><br>
Fich drew his blade again.  If he came from the underneath with a handful of toes
sliced from the warriors of the three-toed clan then he’d certainly garner plenty of
respect, and he could name his price on the mercenary circuit.
<br><br>
The little blue thing’s face became pinched with hatred, his eyes receding to two red
pinpoints.  He spoke something in a guttural language.  Forguscu…. Or maybe
Fergesque… something like that.

Fich smiled and raised his sword arm.  The little man didn’t even flinch.
<br><br>
And pain wracked Fich’s body, starting at his arm and within seconds reaching his
heart.  A cold numbness came over him.  His body seemed to lift from the ground.
The world shook a bit, or perhaps he was the one shaking.  That was when the last of
his senses made some final sense of the world.  He saw the enormous snake’s fang
plunged into his shoulder as his eyes closed for good.  And he could smell it’s stale
and fetid breath as he inhaled for his last time.
<br><br>
In the dark numbness of paralysis he realized that the little blue thing had not
spoken a language so foreign.  He had said "Forte squese"… The eastern dialect phrase
meaning "Snake farmer".
