I'm sorry to write to EQX, but was unable to find Foxglove's email address.
Foxglove,
<br><br>
    Your article "<a href="../Issue69/parttime.htm">Part Time</a>" was wonderful. You described my evenings, right
down to the snoozing husband. I have been struggling with the feeling of
"missing out" because I don't have a lot of playing time, either. I also
have children (2) and one of them, my 11 yr. old son, plays EQ,too, so I
have to give up afternoon play time to him (he keeps his grades up so he can
play EQ or UO). I just wanted to let you know you aren't alone. I know *I*
thought I was the only part-time player who struggles to reach levels. I'm
still only level 2 (monk) and it just irks me I have no more time (I go to
University,also). Anyway, great article. It was greatly appreciated!

I just wanted to thank Foxglove for the wonderful article written about
<a href="../Issue69/parttime.htm">part-time gamers</a>.  It's the basic stop and smell the roses that we all need
to hear from time to time.  I can relate.  With two small children and a
wife that also loves EQ, I don't usually start playing until after 10:30pm.
My friend an I were complaining about "still" being around 8th level when
our fellow guild members are around 17th, and we got into one of those "I'm
not going to bed until I level!" moods.  And after peaking at the cheat
sites to find all the best quests (which I had vowed I would never do) I
needed the "encouragement" to hang in there.  Well written, timely, and
appreciated.  Please pass on my thanks and compliments to the writer

Just wanted to drop a note to add my cudos to the many others I'm sure
you have received about the Everquest Express site.  I thoroughly enjoy
reading it and have gotten much useful information by reading it.
<br><br>
Hats off to you and the EQX Staff.
