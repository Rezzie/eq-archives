I've begun my life as a scholar in the past few months spurred on by the activities of my beloved Ezmend.  A Tier'dal born into the current world can find waiting for him or her little in the way of assistance toward becoming a functioning member of the underground society.  There are no Tier'dal schools, only apprenticeships; Their helpfulness to the student varying widely with the skill of the teacher.  There are no epics to read and understand and model ones self after; Instead we have those sermons spoken aloud in church but which are not carried far.  Few Tier'dal faithfully attend church these days.  Me included.

<font size="-1">
I've had some experience running auctions, and I wanted to share some of the things I've learned.  It's often better to be organized in an auction than to be constantly spamming the auction channel with twelve items in a single message, along with every other auctioneer in the zone.  A good auction will get higher prices for the people selling, and more items out for those interested in buying.

As a long time pen and paper role-player, and an occasional game master, I was intrigued by a description of a Verant run event in EverQuest.  The description came from a friend of mine that, as I just recently discovered, is a guide, and participated as an NPC in the event.  There were several interesting things that this guide mentioned in his re-telling of the event that got me thinking about what, exactly, does it take to make an event work in EverQuest<b>...</b>

I'm back in EverQuest.  Back in full swing.  I wanted to take a second here to thank everyone that sent me an e-mail telling me that they've experienced the same sort of short-term burnout.  I think it's important that we all understand that it's the nature of things.  Even the happiest couples like to spend some time apart.

	This past week I went to Chicago to visit my family and watch a Bears game.  I took my step-daughter, and we had a great time, even though the Bears lost.  I've been thinking lately about why I like EQ so much, and the game sort of brought up a point.

I just wanted to give some feedback on the website and in particular one
of the authors, Nepenthia. I think the site is very well put together
and the ease of which you can find things and the links between them
well connected.  I read what was listed for Nepenthia and wanted to just
express my appreciation for her writing.  Her essays and articles are
well thought out, and provoke thought about alot of the roleplaying
aspects of Everquest.  I wish the best for your site, and hope the good
work continues.
