Hey, I was looking at your site, and something I think would be cool is if you added a search, like search for article titles. because there aresome continuing articles that come in episodes in diferent issues. with a search someone could browse and locate every instilation of that story line.
<br><br>
Just a thought

<em>[Ed. Well, we aren't so sophisticated as all that.  But we might have this problem
solved already.  Our About Us section also includes an index of all the items in EQX listed by
author or artist.  We also list all the regular features.  Take a look, it's there on the left.]</em>

Absor you nut!  It's not hell!  It's Baator!  Get with the times!  And they're not devils- they're baatezu!  Your GM needs to make up his mind whether he wants to live in the past with the monstrous manual or leep into the future with Planescape ;)   The adventure you're playing is from a collection of adventures entitled "well of worlds."  I led my gaming group through every adventure through that book as well (although we're solely dedicated to the planescape setting).
 <br><br>
You want some fun have your GM run you through the "love letter" adventure- that's a good one.  And, just as a suggestion to your DM if he wants it, while you're in Sigil he might want to pick up the Adventure module called "Harbinger House."  I don't know how well he does with pre-made adventures (I know I mostly like to run self manufactured) but that is probably the best module you'll ever play for AD&D.  My players still talk about their experiences with that one.  Good Gaming!

P.S.........PS (Planescape) is the best setting ever!  Watch out for the lady of pain during your visit.

<em>[Ed. Okay, I'll admit it.  I've never adjusted to the new stuff.  I'm getting there,
really I am.  Our GM loves it.  And he is using all the new fangled terminology.  It's
just that I don't use them, so it doesn't come through in my editorials.  And he
has all the stuff ever printed for Planescape, so I'm sure we'll run into "love letter". 
And Ravenloft is the best setting yet...  :P]</em>
