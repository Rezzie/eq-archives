Something truly odd is going on in Norrath over the last few days, and it's all due to the upcoming holiday dedicated to Erollisi Marr.  This holiday, called Ardor Day, was described to us this way by a female Human paladin who herself was dedicated to Erollisi.
<br><br>
<em>"This is the day where love is recognized by all the people of Norrath.  A day of peace, harmony and devotion.  It is especially dedicated to lovers.  It is a time for us to show those that we love how we feel.  For some of you </em>men<em> this seems to be a difficult thing to do.  That is why paladins such as myself will be available to help you to see how important love truly is.  The temple and its servants are available to all to help express your love, help you find appropriate gifts, and to help you see the light that is love.  Tell me, young bard, have </em>you<em> found it within yourself to dedicate yourself to love?  Have you found a proper gift for your loved one?  Have </em>you<em> visited the temple this fine day?  I shall aid you to express yourself..."</em>
<br><br>
It is a good thing that bards have fast tongues, and even faster feet.  A man can only stand so much stress, and the glare of a powerful female paladin who thinks that you have been shirking your duties as a man, or perhaps acting far too much like a man in the first place, is more stress than any man needs.

<p style="text-align: justify">
This stress has brought some men, and perhaps a few women, up to and beyond their breaking point.  All throughout Norrath unusual scenes are being played out.  Things that have caused this bard to shiver more than a few times.

Along with the attention to love, sermons from the temple (or so I heard while hiding in an alley near such a temple) also emphasize commitment.  Commitment to your lover and commitment to Erollisi Marr.  While it is certainly understandable that people love this beautiful goddess of love, during these times preparation for Ardor Day, well, sometimes the power of love becomes frightening.

Good luck to all the lovers out there.  Me, I'm locking my door and waiting until the storm is over.  I hear that Karana has also been smitten by the love goddess...
