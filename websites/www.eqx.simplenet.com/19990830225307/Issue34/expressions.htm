   <em>I would like to you start covering how to role play different races and class. For example I am a troll shadowknight. So the information how to role play a troll and how to role a shadow knight would be very helpful. Thank you

No, thank you Kane for this opportunity to share my view on Trolls and Shadow Knights. Let me start with a bit on power gamers and the belief that Shadow Knights will be the ultimate "Tank Mage" conversion from Ultima Online. There is much to be kept in mind when developing a role in order to keep yourself from becoming outwardly just like any other Player Killer, aside from the PvP Switch.
<br><br>
	Many players see that the mixture of strong necromancy spells mixed with the plate mail armor and heavy weapons will be a perfect combination for player vs. player combat, as well as those that believe that this combination would be perfect for solo play. Neither of these elements that have been tagged to the shadow knight are healthy in a role playing environment if abused, specially if they are also stigmas of non role players as well. It would be difficult to stay in character when you are approached more often as a power gamer or Player Killer. Thus we have to take a different approach to your style from the beginning to escape the stigma.
<br><br>
	I see shadow knights as the Lord Soth and Darth Vadar of EverQuest, deep pools of forbidden pasts and wisdom from beyond the void. The first step to getting away from the chaotic existence of a "kill anything" knight is to choose and study your evil god of worship. From what we have seen on the web page for gods, evil gods seem to focus on negative emotions, as the good gods focus more on positive emotions. A few of them focus on prime elements as well like fire, which could be fun to work into a knight's role.
<br><br>
	Think about a knight, and his oaths and honor and tasks. Either you are a knight or a lordless "ronin" knight; there is not much in-between. If you are lordless, you might as well be a plain warrior without a cause other than greed, for your role would forever be an empty one as compared to serving a dark lord of some sort. What lords do evil knights serve and why?
<br><br>
	While there are many oaths so remember, the most important ones to a computer game role would be related to everyday tasks, like combat. An oath to never retreat in combat could build a very interesting role, and an oath to never attack an unarmed opponent could also. If your god is one of hate, you could make a task of never slipping from that role, always seething with despise for your archenemy. 
<br><br>
Obsession is a very easy element to work into a very entertaining role as well. If you were a follower of a Dark God of disease you could be nearly fanatical about the desecration of clean places and the killing of healers and shamans. Or you could take it one step further to avoid places that were not rotting and decayed, or seek solstice in the dark wet dungeons. Obsession is my favorite dark element, favorite next to flair with words and games of the mind.
<br><br>
Moving on to Trolls and their place in Shadow knight roles, we have been told that they are anarchists and utterly evil. Thinking back on some classic trolls might help evolve your role a bit. Many trolls from faerie tales spoke insults and war cries in rhymes. Go to a library (not on the net) and pick up some old ghost story books and books about trolls. Many of the poems in them are a lot like Golem's dark riddles and usually have dark intent in them. Half of them would easily fit into a macro for text, and the others would be easy to memorize or borrow short parts from. My example would be the line "Flies Flies Eat out his eyes", which is only one line from a much longer poem but sounds awesome as threat or war cry.
<br><br>
Think about anarchists as trolls. Not only do they seek to destroy and main authority, they thrive on "the strongest make the rules" lives. This alone is perfect for the average player killer to adapt a lazy role and not be overly criticized in, yet it also provides a place for you to be different from the others as well. 
<br><br>
Trolls are smarter than Ogres, but still dumb enough to be afraid of many things they do not understand. Of course their reactions will be to kill what they fear. When a group of relatively weak creatures are up against something they fear even anarchists look for a leader to make the decisions and take the fall if necessary. Usually this leader, if he lives, becomes somewhat of an icon. He no longer fears whatever it was, and would then be somewhat of a legend in his group.
<br><br>
When you put the two roles together you can come up with numerous combinations of roles within the normal roles of each. A Troll who worships a god of hate, living his sworn oaths to destroy all that is weak like love and peace and obsessed with something fitting is a good start. Add in his primitive want to smash all that is smarter than he, or to kill anything he might fear and to obtain a leadership role through power and deeds. Mix in the troll's evil rhymes and poetry and a bit of sly humor, and a touch of wisdom. What you have is a multi role character with different aspects you can act out in day to day play.
<br><br>
Remember that it is not the great quests that make you different when you role-play, but the very simple acts in day to day playing. It is safe to say that ninety percent of your role will be shown in the first sixty seconds of meeting someone, after that the conversation will already be underway or too late to start. Keep in mind the very first things that are happening when you meet someone when thinking how your character would act. First impressions are not only important in role playing but in the role itself.
<br><br>
What is a troll's first impression of meeting an outsider? What is a troll's first thought when seeing someone in combat that needs help? What does a troll have to say or think when meeting in a shop to sell loot and buy items? Your role will develop from these few very common meetings, and shine from them as well. Keep this in mind while making your character bio, perhaps even write one of each into a story or just think it out in your head. 
<br><br>
Good Luck,
<br><br>
