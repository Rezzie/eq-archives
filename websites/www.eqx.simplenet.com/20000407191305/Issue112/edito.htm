It's been a busy week for me, both in Norrath and in real life.  Posy is now almost to the taxi level, where she can shuttle people around Norrath.  My huge burst of leveling momentum is dropping, though, even with the end in sight.  I took some time out with Posy just to relax and goof off, and met some new people, and this got me to thinking about what I like and dislike most about EverQuest.
<br><br>
It's not class balance, because to me that winds up being a non-issue. I'm just not that power-conscious.  It's not lack of quests, because I think there are plenty, nor is it the economy, although I see a definite trickle-down which is disturbing - it's a rare character that doesn't have full bronze by level 10, if they can wear it.  My favorite and least favorite part of EverQuest is the players.
<br><br>
Why are they my favorite part?  The kindness and good nature of players that I meet while playing astound me. I'd like to tell you about some of my favorite people in Karana.  
<br><br>
The noble paladin Cairbre in his dusty armor, seeking out both adventure and to triumph over evil.  I first met him through a friend, and watched him climb from the mid-40's to level 50 - as a paladin, before the patch.  It must have taken an incredible amount of work.  He often plays in character, and we also chat about Norrath and Norrath's people while he's running around the Plane of Hate and I'm running around South Karana.  He is a kind and generous player, and a good friend.
<br><br>
Pheyn the druid. While playing a druid character in Misty thicket, he ran by and gave me some of those incredible druid buffs, and we wound up chatting while I raced through Misty thicket inviting red monsters to impale themselves on the thorns he gave me.  A former beta tester, he is good natured and thoughtful, and kind to others he meets.
<br><br>
Sadrya the dark elf wizard. One of the more motivated people I've ever seen, this woman raced to level 50 in the time it took me to level three characters to 12 J.  Full of wizardly advice and with a sarcastic edge to her humor, I always say hello when I see her on.
<br><br>
Oxesiess, the barbarian bashy.  Our own Oxesiess is one of the most fun people to play with, whose character is both a great character concept, well-played and a ferocious group leader.  We've hunted in Cazic Thule together and the interaction between Posy, the Kaboommaker, and the 7-foot tall warrior has me in stitches.  This brings me to:
<br><br>
Morgaelin, the wood elf ranger, another funny, fun person, quiet in his humor but ferocious in battle.  Morgy will risk everything to save the party, and best of all, he refuses to kill a mermaid to get the great bow Raincaller. Why should you have to kill certain creatures to do quests, which seem like against your own class?
<br><br>
Chrysis the bard, whom I haven't seen in a while.  She is the funniest, most mouthy-obnoxious character I have ever met.
<br><br>
There are many others I'd like to list, and I will, with the general comment that these are all good companions and people I see as an asset to Norrath, and make me want to come back over and over.  Loril, Danubus, Erazimus, and the rest of the Storm Wolves, Grubbin, Dravic, Cattinea, the best run Gnome warrioress I've ever played with. Bigsrot, Trindle, and the Incanescere players I've met. Scoop, the power-leveling paladin - he and Posy were 17th together, now he's 38 and I'm 27th. Dimtry, who quoted poetry to Posy over tells for 15 minutes.  What a bard!
<br><br>
And finally, those who respond with good humor when I enter a zone and shout "I am Posy, hear me ROAR!"
<br><br>
On the opposite side of the story, we have the "other" players.  The reason I sometimes gnash my teeth while typing furiously.
<br><br>
Those that come up to my gnome wizard and say "Can u sow plz?" (What's up with that? Gnomes don't have sow, never will) 
<br><br>
 The Kill Stealers, who lift the sweat and blood of the groups efforts and run off with the benefits. 
<br><br>
Those who refuse to play within accepted practices, like camp stealers or poachers, who pick fights or run to get higher level characters of theirs to make a camp unlivable and then bring back their weaker characters to take the camp.
<br><br>
Beggars.   From people coming up and saying "Do u have spare plat plz?", those who run shouting from zone to zone for money, sow's, reses, or clarities.  What is so hard about /who 29 35 enchanter, or /who 35 50 cleric?  One day I was joking around in ooc with a character, and they accidentally hit a hotkey, which resulted in a big "ooc looking for spare plat or wiz items plz".  Instant turn off.
<br><br>
Anyone who inflicts the zone with their hate or bile. I've seen players reduced to tears from harassment, and I take every opportunity to report those players who do.  I've taken to keeping the profanity filter on, just to reduce the impact they have on my enjoyment of the game.
<br><br>
It's important to note that the negatives are FAR outweighed by the positives.  After a while I guess I get a little immune to them, or on occasion, do a little in character belittling of them. It doesn't bother me too much because even though I play many different characters, I am still able to find folks who are fun to play with and group with them consistently.
<br><br>
Many of us now have played EverQuest almost a year, and some more.  Those that get bored with the game might want to look around - not for new adventures, not for new items or zones, but new people.   It is the good people you meet that elevate the game beyond a console or PC game and make it a true world.
