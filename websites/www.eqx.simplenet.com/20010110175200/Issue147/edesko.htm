    seemed to leap up and snag this issue. I spent half the week with a fouled-up

    on Saturday! Then Morgaelin had trouble with his e-mail! My apologies if anyone 
    sent me mail in the middle of the week, please send it again and hopefully 
    I&#146;ll have no problems.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&#146;ve 
    gotten a few letters like the one below and wanted to address them for those 
    of you writing stories and articles about EQ or role-playing.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hello,</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    am an avid EQ player (along with several other games, this is my only online 
    game). I started playing rpg's back in the late 70's. D&amp;D and the later 
    AD&amp;D were my games of choice in my youth.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently 
    I have spent a lot of time with Warhammer and Magic, the Gathering.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm 
    sure that since Absor's move to VI you've received a lot of letters like this... 
    I'm distressed that it took me this long to find you... I follow quite a few 
    boards but somehow EQX didn't make my radar.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    reason I am writing is that while reviewing some of Absor's prior work I came 
    across a letter suggesting that you would accept contributing articles and 
    editorials...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    would be very interested in contributing some articles and was wondering what 
    I should do; just send you unsolicited work? I used to write for a daily newspaper 
    in my home state of NH, the Daily Telegraph. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yours 
    truly,</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greyfin 
    Twiceborn</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take 
    a look at our <a href="../credits/submit.htm">submissions guidelines</a>. 
    Many of our current and former staffers were folks who just started out sending 
    stuff in. We&#146;ll take a look at it and put it up if it's good. If you 
    contribute good material on a steady basis, we'd definitely consider adding 
    you to the staff. With Absor&#146;s Ab-sence we are definitely looking to 
    add quality writing to our staff.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Experience 
    with different gaming systems helps, as does experience writing for other 
    sites or employers. Keeping up with current issues in EQ or online gaming 
    by reading the message boards or watching gaming sites helps also. The ability 
    to look at the &#147;big picture&#148; and not focus narrowly on a pet topic 
    helps.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    began writing for EQX back in Issue 7, by just sending in an article on a 
    topic that I hadn&#146;t seen anyone cover and I thought was important. I 
    continued to send in articles over the next weeks, and now, almost three years 
    later, I&#146;ve somehow wound up with a rather large body of content. It&#146;s 
    amazing to think that we are fast approaching our 150th, and shortly after, 
    our 156th or third year of publishing. We have been blessed with many talented 
    contributors, some who have moved on to write or draw professionally based 
    on the experience obtained through writing for us.</font></p>

    Enjoy this issue!</font></p>
