This is our last issue for a few weeks.  We will be back on the 25th of March.  We are not going away.  We are just taking a break.
<br><br>
When we started EverQuest Express we made ourselves several promises.  We would present things that were not available on other sites, and not repeat things that were.  We would always prize quality over quantity.  We would speak to the role-player and the storyteller.  And we would quit when it became more work than fun, or when we were no longer providing anything useful to the public.
<br><br>
Well, lately for some of us, though by no means for all of us, these goals are not being met.  This break will allow us to regain our mental and physical strength.  We will probably also be considering a few changes for EverQuest Express.  There are only so many worthwhile articles to write about one game.  We will be looking into ways to make our publication a bit more vibrant and worthwhile for our readers.
<br><br>
Now, if you are a contributor, this is not a vacation for you!  We'll still need your great input when we come back.  So keep writing while we're resting.  That's fair, isn't it?  <b>:)</b>
<br><br>
In any case, we will return.  We are not closing down.  We'll post reminders to any site that will print it upon our return.
<br><br>
Thanks for your patience.
