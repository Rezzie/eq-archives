<b>Magic or other special abilities</b>
<br><br>
I really love magic.  I love experimenting with magic, but how about a magic system
that does not have you mastering a spell after one attempt?  Magic should strengthen
with experience.  How about a teleport spell.  When you first learn the spell you
find yourself transporting players into uncharted areas, and in the middle of oceans,
or worse you stick them in the side of a wall, severing their leg.  
<br><br>
<b>Huge Maps!!</b>
A good game has to have lots of areas.  Areas that don’t look alike!  I would like to
spend days trying to get to a secluded location that I heard about in a tavern.
Traveling across oceans should also be fun.  Climbing aboard a huge freighter and
wandering the lengths of the ship.  Just please do a better job than SSI did!

And first person views:  Nuff said!

<b>Multi Player</b>
<br><br>
You know if I’m telling you about a game, it has to support multi player.  I just
can’t find solitaire games that keep me interested longer than a few days.  That’s
why I gave up on MM6 so fast.  Just wasn’t there, you know?  Online games are the way
of the future.  You just can’t create a game that can replace human nature and
error.

So here I sit.  Its four PM on Friday, and I have just finished this article.  I
have four more days, all to myself, and not a damn thing to do.  (I hear Unreal is
out.  Wonder if EB has it yet)
