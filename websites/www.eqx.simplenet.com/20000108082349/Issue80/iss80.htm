It was a very nervous and subdued Kinory who climbed the steep and narrow steps to the roof of the Guildhouse the next night.  The air was hot and still, heavy with moisture.  She emerged onto the rooftop and walked to the edge.  Five stories down, the hard-packed dirt of the street was dark and shadowed.  No sound broke the night at all.

<em>In a smoky room of the dark Inn of Freeport, the soft music of the lute fades to a lingering note as the Bard unfolds three faded parchments.  The patrons can see the scrawling words written on them.  He stands and pulls out the first reading in a soft spellbinding voice...</em>

I've been mulling about the whole issue of roleplaying for, well, it seems like forever.  But mostly since EverQuest came out.  In that time I have been contemplating the differences between player types, trying to see if roleplaying has some sort of definition and attempting to discover what it would take to make a really solid online RPG.

Kerys fidgeted uncomfortably as he stood in the marble hallway.  The door in front of him led to trouble.  He knew that, with as much certainty as he knew the sun would rise the next day.  Being a wood elf, he didn't like being cooped up in any building, but the marble city of Felwithe was especially unpleasant for him.  He could feel the weight of the heavy stone walls and ceilings upon him, and longed to be out in the Greater Faydark forest again.  Given a choice he would be there at that moment, but he had been summoned to the white city, and he didn't dare refuse the one who had summoned him.

Razor removed a small thin metal rod from his black leather leg pouch.   There was not a lock made in all of Norrath that he couldn't pick.  He took pride in his work.  He carefully and quietly worked the intricacies of the lock mechanism and within seconds a slight metallic "click" could be heard.  From his leather pouch he removed a second item, a small jar of gnome grease.  After rubbing the grease on the hinges, Razor quietly opened the door.

Hmmm…  I have been drawing most of my inspiration lately from the things that have upset me in the EverQuest community.  Having vented all of that, with no apparent effect on the world at large, I find myself at a loss for something to discuss this week.  I see this as a good thing, and a bad thing.  Good because I'm not angry about anything.  Bad because I'm not inspired by anything wonderful either.

This e-mail is in response to the article <em><a href="../Issue78/switch.htm">Switch off, brain off</a></em> in EQX issue 78. Specifically this short-sighted quote from that article:
"<em>[Verant is] a corporation, and as such will always lean toward the way that gives them the widest audience and the most cash. It's not in their interest to eliminate players, and thus is born the RP switch</em>."
