  <b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commentary - 
  Bard's Log</font></b> 
</center>
<p style="text-align: justify"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  Wow&#133; 50 pages of a comic that I thought wouldn&#146;t be any good. That&#146;s 
  right. Bard&#146;s Log&#146;s first pages were somewhat of a &#147;pilot&#148; 
  I sent it in to see how the reader would like it. I had no idea how popular 
  my mixed up comic would become! Mixed up may be an understatement, writing Bard&#146;s 
  Log was quite the roller coaster ride, if you noticed no inconsistencies in 
  the plot, I must be the master of improvisation! ^_^</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But where to begin&#133; 
  the characters I suppose. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Kyodai</b>: 
  The name is from the Batman cartoon. Kyodai was Bruce Wayne&#146;s ninja adversary. 
  What does this have to do with a bard? Nothing, Kyodai was the name of my monk, 
  then my ranger, and it stuck with my Bard. His character development was rather 
  shaky. He started off as loving Lanys, then wanting nothing to do with her (to 
  the point where I wrote him as the self serving, selfish type). Once I had an 
  idea of where I was going, he flowed a lot better. His heroics later are sort 
  of a redeeming factor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Gargatox</b>: 
  The big hilarious troll that doesn&#146;t get much on time because he takes 
  up a lot of room (No joke!). With every good hero comes a dumb troll to lighten 
  the mood. Garg is the only character that I&#146;m happy with. He&#146;s simple, 
  hides nothing, and says what&#146;s on his mind, even if it is just &#147;Eet 
  bugz&#148;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lanys</b>: Another 
  shaky character, she went from Evil Princess to cute, fun-loving girlfriend 
  pretty quickly. She&#146;s probably the smartest of the three. She&#146;s some 
  sort of mage/wizard/necro combo, but classes really don&#146;t matter in this 
  comic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Guard and 
  the Guard Who Loses His Helmet</b>: &#145;Nuff said really. Just guards. Why 
  do I include them here? I don&#146;t know, they were fun to work with, especially 
  the one that keeps his helmet. He&#146;s sarcastic, and probably a bit disgruntled 
  with his job.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Innoruuk</b>: 
  Ah the God of Hate. He actually was gonna play a big role in this. Too bad for 
  him. ^_^</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dorn B&#146;dynn</b>: 
  I actually had somebody ask who he was. I didn&#146;t think anybody didn&#146;t 
  know. For those who don&#146;t, Dorn is the scourge of North Ro. I put him in 
  there because my bard was able to kite him to death at level 12 (and we haven&#146;t 
  been nerfed yet! GO BARDS)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Warrior 
  Lady with the Scar</b>: Just a filler character, expect to see her sometime 
  later, though ;)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Charmed 
  Froglok</b>: Also originally had a lot to do in the plot. Keep your eyes peeled. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Damos B&#146;vrnn 
  and the Smiley Faced Orcs</b>: I liked these guys. Damos was my scary, incompetent 
  general who ran around with a band of orcs. Yes, he only has one arm. I have 
  no idea what spawned that, actually. He too originally was going to play a huge 
  part in the comic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Donkey Face 
  and the Crazy Troll</b>: Just more filler characters. Probably knew Garg at 
  some time or another.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Auntie Moog</b>: 
  I loved Auntie Moog. I was saddened to see her go, and this was my tribute. 
  I personally like the &#147;AUNTIE MOOG!&#148; intro she gets whenever she appears.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Gnomes</b>: 
  They&#146;re only in there because I liked the way &#147;Kiss the gnome, Lanys! 
  Kiss the gnome!&#148; sounded. Really! :D</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Garg in the 
  Deputy Mask</b>: Fans loved it, I loved it, Garg at his best.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mooto and Fatty</b>: 
  The Runny Nosed Goblins. Mooto is an actual goblin that spawns in Misty Thicket. 
  Fatty is my own creation, always wanted to know what a fat goblin looked like.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Nosy Evil 
  Eye</b>: He got his own interview, that&#146;s enough for him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fury T&#146;vyl 
  and Zeruel N&#146;tok</b>: Fury is Lanys&#146; jealous older sister. I thought 
  the long-range morning star thing was cool. Wish I had more time to do cooler 
  stuff with that. Zeruel was supposed to be the kind of handsome bad guy that 
  you wanted to hate but couldn&#146;t because of his charm&#133; that didn&#146;t 
  happen. Time constraints made it hard to develop characters like him. His name 
  comes from one of the Angels in <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i>. Expect to see 
  more of Zeruel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Qeynos Guards</b>: 
  I haven&#146;t been to Qeynos in a while so I had no idea what their guards 
  looked like. Oh well. All I can remember are those goofy shields.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Council</b>: 
  Cameo&#146;s galore. I love cameos, there are a lot in Bard&#146;s Log, but 
  you&#146;ll probably never catch them.<br>
  The Cleric: Just a high elf, thought it fitting.<br>
  The Magician: Slayn from <i>Record of Loddoss War</i><br>
  The Enchanter: Didn&#146;t get any lines because I don&#146;t like enchanters, 
  haha.<br>
  The Necro: Scull, an old character of mine.<br>
  The Shaman: Just some crazy barb. I should&#146;ve made it Oxie&#133;<br>
  The Druid: I love doggies&#133;<br>
  The Wizzie: I love <i>Lil&#146; Archy</i> even more. He will be sorely missed 
  (sob)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other fun things: 
  <br>
  -Kyodai&#146;s clothes are based on what my Bard on Rodcet Nife is wearing (Banded)<br>
  -Zeruel&#146;s clothes and weapon choice are heavily based on that of Kenshin 
  from <i>Rurouni Kenshin</i><br>
  -Lanys&#146; party dress is based on the one Deedlit wears in <i>Record of Lodoss 
  War</i>. Kyodai&#146;s tux is totally original.<br>
  -Lanys, despite being a caster, uses magic twice in the whole comic. <br>
  -Kyodai, despite being a bard, sings twice.<br>
  -Gargatox, despite being a shaman, never casts anything.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Well, I hope you 
  sorta enjoyed my rambling. I&#146;ll probably think of more stuff to write later, 
  hahahahahahaha&#133; nah. Anyway, I&#146;m taking a break for a bit. Don&#146;t 
  worry, Bard&#146;s Log is gonna keep going for a while!</font></p>
