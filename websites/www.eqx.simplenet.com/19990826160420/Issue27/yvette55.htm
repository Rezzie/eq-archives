The Ogres and Warriors of Qeynos collided like mountains, thick mists
shrouding the battle. Arrows were fired into the ranks of the powerful
Ogres, and the Ogres stormed into the Warriors, Rangers and Paladins like
a wave of the ocean. Blood ran like rivers into the pools of rain and many
of the men died, laying next to fallen Ogres. Porthios slew many in pursuit
of the leader Gromlyko, to fail in vain as the Ogres disappeared into the
mists leaving the four surviving men to count the fallen. The ogres were
driven back by the powerful magics of the human Archmage Mathius, aid to
Porthios. The other two, Alan Pikeman the Warrior and Bren Oakstaff the
Ranger surveyed the losses with sorrow. Missing were the priestess and
Bastion.

"There is something wrong with a woman that is not willing to stay at home
while the men do their jobs," the Paladin proclaimed, making note of the
missing horses and treasure. "I should have trusted my gut on her, she should
have not come along. Now we have two more outlaws to bring to justice
tomorrow." He stormed away, preparing the burial.
<br><br>
"We don't have this kind of time, Sir. The Necromancer must have led the
Ogres to us, and is no doubt already with the half elf and the treasure."
the Archmage sighed. "The Cardinal was foolish to have sent that letter. I
do not see how he could expect a known enemy of the church to deliver his
quest."

The burial was held and the four men continued on, tracking the outlaws well
into the night. They knew that the main group of their opponents were on
foot, and they would have the advantage of speed. They might not get to the
treasure if it was sent forward on horse, but they would catch several of the
criminals that would be left on foot.
<br><br>
A false dawn laid upon them as they spotted the tiny camp of the group,
pleased to count both horses in the distance. By their path they seemed to be
heading into the southern swamps. The Paladin had no worry, knowing that they
would not leave dry land alive if they ran. The Archmage studied his most
powerful magics preparing for the battle that would soon happen. The sun
would bring the light of justice.
