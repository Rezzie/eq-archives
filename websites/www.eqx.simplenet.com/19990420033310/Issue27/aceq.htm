As editor of EverQuest Express I have printed a few articles that have caused
a bit of a stir.  I've written a few as well.  While EQX will never shy away
from a controversial issue, I also do not intend to allow such things to
become the norm here.  We are here to inform and entertain, not to host a
print version of Jerry Springer. A while back I came up with an unwritten
rule.  Now I'm going to write it: no "controversy" will ever go on for more
than two issues.  So unless you just want me to know your opinion, please
refrain from sending letters to me about this.

I also received quite a few letters from readers that wanted to tell me how
poor Wynns article, <a href="../Issue26/e33.htm">EverQuest vs Asheron's Call</a>, had been.  Some were, well,
unpleasant.  And while I am usually willing to print such letters
(I know my staff can handle it), I
decided on a different tact this time.  I also received letters from Brad
McQuaid, producer of EverQuest, and Jason Booth, Lead Technical Artist on
Asheron's Call.  Those are the letters that I decided to publish.  This may
seem unfair to our readers.  I admit that it is.  But as the editor around
here I have to make these sorts of decisions each week, which letters to
print and which letters to leave out.

It would be easy to print them all.
But then EQX would not be anything more than a sort of moderated news
group.
<br><br>
So I hope that I am not discouraging our readers from sending us letters.  I
certainly will keep printing them.  And I apologize to anyone that sends me a
letter that I don't print.  I hope you understand why.
