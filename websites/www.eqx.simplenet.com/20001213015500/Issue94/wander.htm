The night was young and I was about, enhancing my physical training. For hours before I stayed within the Church, reading old tomes and studying them intensely. But mostly, my mind was upon recent events.  It appears as if my mother Mahlyce has returned to the land of the living.  Her former master… but I would label him more her tormenter, made a deal with the Mistmoor Vampires to have her returned.  I fear his only bargaining chip, though, was his own soul.  From what I hear, he no longer serves the Father.
<br><br>
Also, the attacks by the Minions of Pain, Thepa's own, have spread all across Norrath.  The God of Pain has been busy indeed converting many to his will.  One of the factors in this is his Wanderer known as Zifeer.  Before his conversion, Zifeer was a child of Tunare, a wood elf druid.  He roamed the lands, recording everything he saw, and would retell the tale to all he saw.  But then, on one of his travels, he came upon the monk Amano…  the puppet of Thepa.  At that point, Zifeer no longer existed and the Wanderer stood in his place.  His new mission in life was to roam the lands and collect bodies for his master.
<br><br>
As of late, I have been brought to the Wanderer's attention.  It is almost daily he assaults my mind with telepathic shouts.  I have faced a few of these Minions of Pain and sent them running back to their master… but they were of lesser power than I.  Were I to ever face the Wanderer… I am unsure if I would live.
<br><br>
After spending the entire day in the Library, I needed a break from the monotony.
<br><br>
I grabbed my staff and walked outside the gates of Neriak into Nektulos. The cold wind swept through me and chilled me to the bone. I felt alive. I started walking towards the undead monolith, healing and "buffing" my brothers and sisters on the way there, when the winds brought me an even colder chill.
<br><br>
At first I was unsure of what it was. My body was tense, my senses more alert than I can remember. Power began to circulate through my very being. I looked all around, my eyes peering into the darkness. There was a great evil about in the Nektulos and I knew it belonged to the Deceiver. A minion of Thepa.
<br><br>
Immediately, I cast spells of protection on myself and moved from the road into the woods. A hunter was in our woods and would now become the hunted. I was unsure of who I would be facing but I felt its power and it was immense. If I could not best the creature, I could at least relay the information to my brothers and sisters so they could save their lives.
<br><br>
Thoughts invaded my mind... thought that were not my own... 
<br><br>
 'Master, she is close now, very close. I shall salvage this day for you!'
<br><br>
Immediately, I knew who it was. The Wanderer, Minion of Pain, puppet of the Deceiver. He must be nearby indeed for his thoughts were very strong and very... putrid.
<br><br>
 'Master, she comes! Hah, she is but a child!'
<br><br>
His thoughts invade my mind again! He must see me! Immediately, I run behind some trees, moving very slowly through them. Finally, I could see Zifeer as I peered from my spot. I dropped to the ground and snuck up on the Wanderer.
<br><br>
"What business do you have in the Nektulos, Wanderer?"
<br><br>
He looks around, searching for me as he hears my voice. His eyes peering through every brush nearby. But, still he could not find me.
<br><br>
"I have business with you... which I do not quite understand. You are just a child and no match for myself much less for the God of Pain."
<br><br>
"Then leave these woods now, Wanderer."
<br><br>
"Are you scared of me, child? Do you fear your betters? Do you fear that your god cannot protect you from the might of Thepa?"
<br><br>
Rage surged through my very being. How dare he speak of the Father so! I moved from my hiding spot, just feet from the Wanderer. Perhaps I would die, but I would not sulk in the shadows like a scared child. I would do the Father and my mother proud. If I die, I would die as a Teir'Dal.
<br><br>
"Watch your blasphemous tongue lest I be forced to pull it from your lying mouth!" I shouted at him.
<br><br>
The Wanderer jumped back, not realizing I was so close. He reached out to touch me but I quickly called upon the power of furor... its mana seeping at my fingertips, just waiting to be released.
<br><br>
"Do not touch me!" I commanded.
<br><br>
The Wanderer's eyes flashed blue as he let loose a long and hard laugh.
<br><br>
"A mere child... telling me what to do... as if you could resist the power of Thepa!"
<br><br>
But I said nothing. I stood there, my eyes peering into his eyes... into his very soul. I could see the true face of Zifeer behind the puppet. He was scared. He was fearful of the things done with his body. He wished to be released or to be killed.
<br><br>
"Where are your words of bravado now, child?" The puppet says as his eyes come aglow with flames. "Perhaps if I seek out your mother, I would hear your cries of pain."
<br><br>
I became engulfed with rage and hatred! I warned Thepa and his minions about threatening my mother in the past... she has been through enough hardships just because of me! I would not let her be harmed again!
<br><br>
"You are about to see the true light, child."
<br><br>
"Light, you wish to see light?!" I more snarl than say. "Let the light blind you!" With that, I unleash the spell Blinding Light and temporarily take the puppet's vision. With him in that state, I begin to unleash a barrage of furor, striking him over and over. When I ran out of mana, I ran upon him just as his vision returned and began to hit him with my staff.
<br><br>
The Wanderer just laughed, though. I gave him some of my best shots and he was barely even half dead. The Wanderer began hitting me with his own staff. I could parry some of his blows but he was more skilled than me in the ways of physical weapons. Every time I could strike him, though, he just laughed. The pain seemed to make him weaker... yet stronger.
<br><br>
Finally, his blows were harming me than I could hurt him. He brought his staff down, sweeping my legs and knocking me to the ground. He stood over me, his staff in my face, his eyes a deep blue.
<br><br>
"Now you shall be the master's!" he shouts in victory. As he said the words, I could feel the power of Thepa invading my mind... his pull strong indeed. And all the while, Zifeer just stood over me, laughing. That is when he made his mistake.
<br><br>
"Your god is weak, child. Innoruuk is but a child compared to Thepa. And he can no more protect you than he will save your mother!"
<br><br>
"Do not take the Father's name in vain!" I exclaim, grasping my staff and knocking the Wanderer down just as he had done to me. And that is when I felt the change. I could feel the power building inside me. Power I have only felt once before... when I had killed the human in the Commons. Hatred seeped through my every pore, hatred against Thepa.
<br><br>
"I hope you brought more than that staff or this will be over before it has begun," Zifeer says, his hands aflame. He brings his hands up to eye level, aiming at my head, trying to make an effect. And he sees the change in my eyes. As his glow blue, mine are a dark black. He sees my eyes are like his. That of a cold, merciless killer.
<br><br>
"I have the Father Innoruuk on my side!" I rush at the Deceiver, my staff moving in my hands. "He is all that I need... now or ever!"
<br><br>
Zifeer's hands shoot out the flames he was holding back, the fire rushing through the air. I dash to the right, being missed altogether. I hit the tree, kicking off it and propelling myself towards my quarry.
<br><br>
"His strength is greater than any weapon forged by man or elf!" My foot squarely hits Zifeer in the chest. The Wanderer's back hits a tree but before he can recover, I follow up with a double-handed upper cut, sending his head into the tree.
<br><br>
"Who are you?!" Zifeer lets lose another barrage from his hands.
<br><br>
"I am the Mouth of Innoruuk, Deceiver of the Teir'Dal!" I yell as I drop to the ground, getting underneath the flames. "And it is time for you to pay for all the Teir'Dal blood you have spilled!"
<br><br>
I sweep Zifeer's legs again, sending him crashing to the ground. He, in turn, sprays the floor trying to take out my legs. At the last moment, I do a back flip, barely being missed again.
<br><br>
"Do you think you are a god?!" Zifeer jumps to his feet, too. Yet again we face off.
<br><br>
"No, I do not, Blasphemous One." We stare into each other's eyes, our souls locked in battle. "Gods would be merciful."
<br><br>
 "You must be made to suffer as you have made others suffer!" The trees around us explode, none of the shards touching me. All that was visible to Zifeer now was two slivers of shining black in the darkness. "You must feel their pain!"
<br><br>
"You must have mistaken me for someone who cares," Zifeer says, slowly backing up and unleashes with yet another barrage of flames.
<br><br>
For a moment... nothing. Then the two specks of red reappear. "And you have obviously mistaken me for a mortal."
<br><br>
"How could you...?" Fury explodes in Zifeer, his berserker rage swelling up inside of him, trying to break free. He can feel the power surging inside of him, intensifying. "I am going to destroy you!"
<br><br>
"You cannot destroy that which cannot be stopped."
<br><br>
The eyes move closer and closer until Zifeer could make out my shape. No fear shown in those eyes, only an indisputable will.
<br><br>
 "Listen here, Miss Holier Than Thou, I will destroy you!"
<br><br>
 "Then we shall destroy each other and walk hand in hand..." I walk forth from the shadows, hands aglow at my sides, "through the gates of Heceldamar!"
<br><br>
I keep coming forth until I stood directly in front of Zifeer, our faces only inches apart.
<br><br>
Zifeer tries to strike me but I move with unbelievable speed. My fists are upon him, each time I strike him, furor unleashes with my blows. I continue striking him, hit after hit, making him stagger back. Then I hear the voice inside my head...
<br><br>
 'MASTER, SHE IS…NO! HELP MEEEE!'
<br><br>
I smiled as I heard it. My hands aglow, I struck him again and again until he fell before me. My hands stayed aglow but I did not strike. I just looked at the body.
<br><br>
"Finishhhh it!" Zifeer screamed with his last ounce of strength.
<br><br>
I looked into this eyes, into his soul again, and I could see the true Zifeer behind it. He wishes to be freed from this hell he was placed in.
<br><br>
I stood before his fallen body and said my prayer, hoping to release his soul from the Deceiver's grasp.
<br><br>
"My mouth is the Mouth of Innoruuk.<br>
The Children shall not stray,<br>
The body shall not fail in His service."
<br><br>
And with that, I let loose my final strike, slaying the Wanderer. As I did so, I could feel the change. Zifeer would be reborn, but not into the service of the Deceiver. He had been freed and he would return to Tunare, still a foe of the Teir'Dal but no longer the minion of the greater evil Thepa. 
<br><br>
I felt the power leaving me... my bones became weary. Even my mind was sore.  I began my walk back towards Neriak. I had to rest and I knew this night I would not have the dreams. The voices would not invade me. I had earned my night of sleep.
