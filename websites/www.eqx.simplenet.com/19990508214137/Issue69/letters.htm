I have been reading EQ Express for several months now.  I do not know why
you do what you do here, but you are extremely good at it.  In addition to
stories that are brilliant and fun to read I think that in a strange way,
you have helped bring us an experience that may be unique.  Before the
release of Ever Quest, your articles grabbed my interest and held it.  I
couldn't wait to see the game.  Now that I have been able to play the game,
the richness of your tales has become not just interesting, but there is
also a sense that I have met some of those same people and have traveled the
same lands you write about.  It is an experience that you cannot obtain by
just reading fiction or just playing a game.
<br><br>
In other words, how cool is this?  
<br><br>
Thanks, hope to you meet you out there someday.  <br>
Murdok, apprentice Bard

I enjoyed Bauhaus's article "<a href="../Issue68/rallos.htm">Two Weeks in Rallos Zek</a>".  I think he nailed the advantages and disadvantages of the PvP environment right on.
 <br><br>
I chose to play on the PvP server, not because I was a big fan of PK play, but that I felt it offered more latitude for RP (especially for the dark races).  But Sunday I quit and abandoned my level 7 Ogre Shaman, Grimjakk, because I  could no longer deal with the incessant looting that goes on.  
 <br><br>
If I am killed by a player, I don't mind it so much... they earn it, and I know who to call vendetta upon.  But as things stand now, WHENEVER you die, your corpse is open to loot, just as if you had been killed by a player.  The first vulture that comes along can wipe out of work by taking your armor or best weapon. AND YOU WILL NEVER KNOW WHO DID IT!  That's the part that burns me.
 <br><br>
I have heard rumors that Verant might fix this by locking corpses killed by monsters.  If this ever happens, I'll go back to Rallos Zek, and take up "da work o' da Warlord" again.  
 <br><br>
Thanks for listening,
 <br><br>
(a slightly discouraged) Grimjakk, late of Rallos Zek
