What an extremely silly <a href="../Issue80/line.htm">article</a> by Russel Linton last issue. He seems to
claim that 'powergamers' and 'roleplayers' simply can't co-exist in the
same game, and that they will in every possibly way ruin the game for
one another. Something which cleary isn't true.
<br><br>
Powergamers (most, really) are people who pretend to be themselves in a
fantasy world. Roleplayers are people who pretend to be someone else.
You can't really say that one thing is *better* or more enjoyable than
the other, or why people should prefer one of them as that is the
'right' one.
<br><br>
<em>I totally agree you can't say which is better.  In fact I don't think I ever said one was better than the other, or that one is right and one is wrong.  If I implied that I must apologize. 
<br><br>
Continuing an analogy I started; for instance I don't think country music as a form of music is 'better' in some objective way than rap music.  I do think they attract different listeners and these different groups in many cases don't share the same philosophy of life or enjoy even the same things on a whole.  Not that they wont and can' be friendly to each other either, however preference will dictate that they will naturally gravitate to more lasting relations with those with similar interests.
<br><br>
Powergaming and roleplaying aren't copecetic.  I'm reminded of this everyday I log on as Deloth, Cleric of Innoruuk in my hometown of Neriak.  Here I find Powergamers training and slaughtering guards using the zone boundary for their 'quick escape' route on a fairly regular basis.  
<br><br>
As a Tier'Dal, roleplaying a somewhat important position to Tier'Dal culture; the conduit between Dark Elf and their God, I find it completely irreconcilable that I can do nothing about this incursion and that the answer I receive from these individuals is along the lines of 'They have good equipment dude.' Or in other words: We have no interest in roleplaying so ignore this slaughter of your countrymen and endangering of young Tier'Dal and go about your own business.
<br><br>
Many times I have witnessed members of my own race participating in the endeavor.  Being careful not to directly attack the guards so that they ruin their hometown faction, but healing and buffing the humans, elves, halflings, and dwarves that attack.  Again something as I roleplayer I just have to ignore. But it leaves me feeling a certain loss when my loud mouth cleric is left to ignore such treachery to his people.
<br><br>
I can't fault their methodology; they are doing things right along the lines of the way someone who calls themself a powergamer should.  They are taking the most efficient route to numerical superiority.  
<br><br>
And I'm sure they find people like me annoying who just wont leave them alone to kill what they want with whomever they want and let them treat the environment in whatever way they feel brings them the most numerical reward.
<br><br>
I can think of hundreds of similar examples from just incredibly friendly relations between sworn racial enemies which powergamers wish to ignore to group compositions that see Paladins teamed with Shadow Knights and the like.  All of this serves to degrade the chances of someone interested in RPing being able to immerse themselves in a virtual world.
<br><br>
These two play styles, albeit non-superior to one another, do not mesh well to create a seamless environment. And no, they don't co-exist very well.  If they do it is in a very awkward manner.

Regarding the column "<a href="../Issue79/role.htm">What do you mean you can't define Role playing?</a>" in #79. The writer misses the point completely.
<br><br>
Yes, you can look up the definition of role playing in everything from a dictionary to a Doctoral Dissertation in the Arts. But what Verant is saying is they will not sanction some group of players' definition of  "THE"  form of accepted role playing on a server.
<br><br>
Why does Verant take this stance? Why is it so hard for people like this writer to comprehend the logic behind it? Its really very simple. The moment you  give one player, or a group of players, the ability to dictate how others on the server must play in order to be accepted, you create an environment where abuse will take place, where players will be denied the ability to have fun, and where petty little immature egos will attempt to tell other people what to do.
<br><br>
Its really just that simple.
<br><br>
Anjelika
<br><br><br>
<em>
From the tone of your reply Anjelika I must assume you stopped reading my commentary after the first paragraph. If you had continued, you would have realized my thesis was that Verant has provided us with a definition of role playing in their universe, but has chosen not to encourage it.
<br><br>
In case you haven't noticed, Verant has given a segment of the population the ability to dictate to others how to play their game. How? By refusing to encourage any sort of role playing it has become a defacto haven for those who not only reject role playing, but actively hostile to the entire concept. Role players are repeatedly harassed, abused, ignored, or simply told 'deal with it, you can turn off the channels you don't like'.
<br><br>
Now I agree everyone should have a right to approach a game like this in a manner that entertains them. Unfortunately this freedom gives rise to those that will abuse their freedom by kill stealing, acting like gangsta's and generally trying to ruin others fun. This is not derived by giving "one player, or a group of players, the ability to dictate how others on the server must play in order to be accepted". This phenomenon is simply a by product of the online arena. The Online world seems to attract the best and the worst human behavior. This isn't a paradigm of the gaming environment, it is simply the way things are.
<br><br>
Where I differ with Verant is with their ability as Game Masters to influence the flavor of their game. I feel it is their responsiblilty as GM to encourage the type of environment they desire. Because they labeled EverQuest an RPG, I must assume that is what they were shooting for.
<br><br>
In short, I did not ask them to push my definition of role playing, I simply pointed out that they should be pushing theirs.

Dear EQX,
<br><br>
This is in direct response to Ahtenret's article, "<a href="../Issue78/flaw.htm">Are Massively Mulitplayer Online RPGs Inherently Flawed?</a>" and if you can't print it, could you please forward this to him?
<br><br>
First and foremost, I agree that the RP switch is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.  I don't know how many time's Darvinn and I have been running around playing....yelling for each other...so forth and so on and got several other's yelling at us to take it to /tell.  WELLL....we're roleplaying.  Furthermore, we're roleplaying in a game that is a ROLEPLAYING GAME!!  Not to even mention that we play on Fennon Ro, that HAS been dubbed.....(get this one!!)....THE ROLEPLAYING SERVER!!!!  *t'Ceira catches her breath and climbs off her soap box, dusting herself off*.  
<br><br>
Ok, that being said.  I'm sure you have a few questions.  Like, how did I get this information.  Well, most of it come from being a part of Beta.  Some from eqvault, but mostly from Roleplaying with other characters.  Verant has said that roleplaying really can't be defined.  I have to agree with you there.  What is roleplaying to one person will be different to another.  Here's an example......
<br><br>
Once, I was in the Oasis fighting Caimen and the like and this rude Barbarian came along and killed whatever it was that I was fighting, taking the experience and loot from me.  After he did this to me several times, it became clear that he was deliberately stealing my kills.  I called him a Barbarian Curr and what right had he to take what I had marked as my game!  That sort of roleplaying scene.  Wellll...I expected the same ol' nasty language and/or talk of "...cause I can..." crap, but this time I found another roleplayer.  Unexpected?  Yes!!  Who ever expects a kill thief to roleplay???  Well, this one did.  We ended up really liking each other....he had a  story...a perfectly IC explanation for stealing my kills.   Not a wimpy "I'm a Barb and your a Darky" explanation either.  It WAS roleplaying.  What he was doing was annoying, but it fit into the game!  
<br><br>
Then, another time, I was challenged by a greenie PK'er.  Huh??  What was he thinking?  He was not even 5th and here I am at 13th?  AND HE'S CHALLENGING ME!?!?!  Welll....I of course brushed it off and thought that he was just like all the other PK moron's that I'd met.  He just wanted to fight and had picked the wrong person.  (I ALWAYS stay on Anon for many many reason's...and don't give my level out lightly even in /tell.  But, that's another letter altogether)  Anyway, He dogged me, shadowed me. Talking and bugging.  I noticed that everything he said was totally IC.  This intrigued me.  I stay IC all the time.  Rarely speaking OOC anyway, so I was IC.  Finally, it came out that he had intended to Roleplay a PK'er all the time, and it just happened that my character's race/class  (no matter what the level) would be KOS to his persona.
<br><br>
I could go on.  I've met many roleplayers playing character's that most roleplayers wouldn't consider  as roleplaying characters.  But, I have a lot of respect for the PK roleplayer....or the powerplayer  roleplayer...or even the kill thief roleplayer.....why?  Because, that kind of roleplaying is a challenge!  Any ol' fool can be a warrior and just kill anything they see, but it takes someone with real imagination to kill everything they see for a GOOD reason that fit's into the world and into that character's persona and history!  These RP'ers have a hard time because of all the moron's running around making a bad name for the one's who want to roleplay.  Now, I reserve judgement until I am SURE that the person who's acting like this is a non-roleplayer.  Like the one's yelling at me and Darvinn to "...take it to /tell...."  I always get a laugh when I hear this....are they speaking in some weird lingo I've never heard before?  What is this strange /tell thing I keep hearing about?  *t'Ceira smiles impishly and giggles*
<br><br>
One more thing before I say my farewells.  Fennon Ro is SUPPOSED to be the roleplaying server!!!  THAT'S why it was set up back in Beta!!  I think that most of the Roleplayers have been intimidated and bullied by all the non-rp'ers so much that they've become afraid to speak up and take their server back!  I would not have put my character on a different server unless it was for the RP'ers.  And I refuse to allow the non-roleplayers to either run me off or force me to stop roleplaying.  You suggested that Verant create a server JUST for roleplayer's.  Why?  Isn't the entire game supposed to be FOR roleplayers?  Why not put up a server just for NON-roleplayers?  Make one for the moron's who want to talk in OOC all the time.  Give them a place to go so the rest of us can play the game the way it was supposed to be played in peace and quiet!!  And turn off that silly RP switch!!
<br><br>
Well, thanks for listening to me rant! *t'Ceira smiles softly and nods her head in farewell*
<br><br>
May your blade be swift and your wit swifter still,

Hello,
<br><br>
First, I'd like to say how much I enjoy each issue of EQX.  The Q&A section is always informative, the fiction ranges from good-hearted amateur to excellent professional quality stories.  And Archanalia's cartoons score consistently above average for professional publications, and are astounding for an amateur publication (and they're always amusing).
<br><br>
I'd like to say that the letter to the editor in Issue 80 from Philip/Troas is, if not perfect, an excellent and well-thought out suggestion.  The objections that Michael Walsh/Ahtenret voices seem to be dealt with quite well in the original letter -- he fears posses of jerks jerkifying the righteous, but the suggested limit of 1 per game day coupled with the suggestion that raising someone's JL raises your own would mean that such an association would be keeping their own levels high by such actions.
<br><br>
Now, I don't know if Jerk Levels should result in some sort of automatic punishment, but it could certainly be tracked and perhaps visible to other players.  GMs and Guides could investigate particularly high JLs by observing their behaviour anonymously and taking appropriate action for extreme cases.
<br><br>
I think it's an excellent mechanism for the players to police themselves with a minimum of GM or Guide intervention.  In any case, I believe it deserved more than the dismissive comment from Michael.
<br><br>
Just my opinion.

Dear Ahtenret,
<br><br>
I read your article about the day you almost quit Everquest, and while I haven't yet experienced an exchange quite that nasty, I've seen quite a bit of rude behavior.  I've thought about the problem, and have a proposal for a possible fix I'd like to bounce off of you before I send it off to Verant.
<br><br>
-------<br>
Summary:<br>
Institute a "jerk level" statistic that tracks how much other people complain about a character's behavior.  Have guides monitor the  behavior of jerks or have the server take direct action against people who are jerks.
<br><br>
Premise:<br>
Jerks are a minority of players that offend fairly large numbers people on a fairly regular basis.
<br><br>
Requirements:<br>
1) the solution must involve limited or no GM involvement<br>
2) it must not be incredibly difficult to program<br>
3) it must actively discourage "jerk" behavior, as defined by the majority of players witnessing or being affected by said behavior<br>
4) it must be resistant to abuse by said jerks
<br><br>
Proposal:<br>
Create a new statistic, the "jerk level" (hereafter abbreviated JL).  Players can declare someone to be "a jerk" once/EQ day.  Declaring someone to be a jerk increases their JL by one, and uses up your ability for the day.  Every day (at sunrise, perhaps?) your JL decreases by one, bottoming out at zero.  JL is preserved at logoff, but is slightly reduced upon death.
<br><br>
Discussion:<br>
The JL is a tool to be used to promote good manners and role-playing in EQ. If a player is behaving like a jerk, target him and identify him as a jerk.  Declarations are limited to one/EQ day to discourage abuse.  This will hopefully encourage people to save it for something truly offensive.  If a pack of d00ds fingers you, simply be elsewhere in an hour or two when they can declare again.  Similarly, your JL declines to zero by one/EQ day to allow the odd insult or the past of a reformed character to be forgotten.  When JL reaches a certain target, (50?) begin enforcement procedures.  Have all stats, skills, and/or faction ratings reduced by one for every JL over 50.  This should cause the jerk to lose the ability to do whatever it is that others found offensive (killstealer's spells fizzle, engineers can no longer outrun trains, etc).  Faction hits could eventually cause guards to "take out the trash" - making even cities hazardous for jerks. Alternatively, have guides monitor players with high JLs and take whatever action they deemed appropriate.  By having culprits identified by quite a few players at once, the guide's time can hopefully be conserved.  When you are fingered as a jerk, you should get a notification of this fact *without* the JL attached - keeping 'em guessing should keep 'em civil.
<br><br>
Tweaks:<br>
1) adjust the target JL for automatic action to make it easier or harder to be flagged<br>
2) adjust JL loss at death.  Blood should pay for sins, but how many?<br>
3) disallow use by and/or targeting of newbies (say, level 3 and under) who can't be expected to have learned the ropes yet.<br>
4) limit the max increase of JL to, say, 10/day.  Doing one incredibly stupid act (say, training DVinn, Crush, & co. into several lower level parties at the Faydark zone) shouldn't by itself make you a jerk.<br>
5) when you finger someone as a jerk, *your* JL raises by one to limit casual use.
<br><br>
-------<br>
Comments?  Suggestions?  Improvements?  I'm not sure how refined this idea should be before sending to Verant, or what exactly those proper channels would be.  Please let me know what you think...I look forward to your reply.

<em>Phillip,
<br><br>
While your ideas are interesting and have a certain degree of merit (a player policed society sounds like a good idea in may ways), your jerk rating has the unfortunate side effect of being open to abuse. Any time players can flag one another for negative purposes you open the door to those very same 'jerk' players forming associations and labeling everyone around them just out of sheer snottyness. This is one of the biggest problems in the Online world. Who does one 'police' the player base without opening the door to abuse? I certainly haven't figured it out. I don't think any of the companies have either.
<br><br>
Personally I'd love to see the noose in Freeport get used every so often. But as it stands now, I'll stick to one of the precepts of the U.S. legal system: it is better to let a hundred murderers go free than persecute one innocent. Unfortunately we have to take the same approach to online gaming. You think people complain now when they are effected by a bug? Imagine what would happen if an innocent was 'jerked'.
