    align="JUSTIFY"><big><big>I</big></big>t was Anarchalia, the horde&#146;s battle
    tactician. The grizzly old man had been plundering towns for nigh on fifty years, and his
    experience was invaluable in such battles. &#147;What do you advise old goat?&#148; asked
    Absor.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Anarchalia scratched his chin, and gazed into the distance, his head
    deep in thought. After a few minutes he seemed to come up with a solution, and he turned
    back to face his lord. &#147;I think the best way,&#148; he said, his words laden with a
    lifetimes experience. &#147;is to ride into the town, and then.... kill em.&#148;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Lord Absor nodded in agreement, amazed as always at the complex battle
    strategies the old man kept stored away in his head.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&#147;Mount up and ride.&#148; Absor screamed to his men and he swung
    up onto his horse. The men dropped what they had been doing, and jumped upon their mounts,
    spurring them into a charge, following their lord into the battle that lay ahead. </font></td>
    <td valign="top" style="text-align: justify" width="37%"><font face="boldPS" size="3"><p
    align="JUSTIFY">Arawn sat with his back against the town&#146;s defensive wall. Why did he
    have to perform guard duties today of all days? He was picked for guard duties every
    Christmas, it just wasn&#146;t fair. He heard a faint rumbling, and looked at his stomach,
    he could picture all the delicious foods that he should be eating right now. The rumbling
    got louder. Arawn looked puzzled, perhaps it wasn&#146;t his stomach making the noise,
    what was it then?</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">He slowly staggered to his feet, brushed off some snow, and turned to
    look over the wall. His eyes focused on a pack of wolves in the distance.... big wolves...
    no wait... horses. Those people on the horses looked like... b... b.... b...</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Arawn opened his mouth to scream, but nothing came out. His feet were
    glued to the floor. His eyes were locked on the barbarian horde charging towards the town.
    For a few moments the world seemed to grind to a halt. Suddenly the world sped up again
    and he was screaming panicked words at the top of his lungs.</font></td>
    <td valign="top" style="text-align: justify" width="30%"><font face="boldPS" size="3"><p
    align="JUSTIFY">Courageous looked up at the town walls to where a guard stood screaming
    and pointing outside the town. He heard the thunder of hooves approaching and his heart
    filled with dread.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&#147;Close the gates.&#148; he shouted at the gate tower. But the
    gates didn&#146;t move, there was no-one there to operate them, it was Christmas after
    all.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">There wasn&#146;t enough time to get to the gates and close them.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&#147;Alert the town.&#148; he screamed to Arawn, and then turned to
    his patrol. &#147;Defensive positions, form a line across the road.&#148;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The patrol hurried to form a defensive barrier, their pikes forming a
    wall of sharp steel.</font></td>
