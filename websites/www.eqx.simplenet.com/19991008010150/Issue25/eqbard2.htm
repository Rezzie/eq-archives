Since we don't have a list of songs that the EQ bard can learn I won't travel
too far with a song list.  But from recent posts on EQvault and Wynn Orill's
excellent article in Issue 24, we can look at some possibilities.  Songs will
likely be like spells: once found, a bard can learn them and scribe them in
his/her "songbook".   S/he can then memorize them for singing (which Wynn
reports takes about 40 seconds) and use mana to sing (cast) them.  Once
sung, a song would need to be re-memorized.  This system is pretty
unrealistic for what bards were really capable of  (one Irish bard could
sing over 500 songs and tell over 2000 stories, verbatim, each time, some
stories taking over a week to tell), it is likely a game balance issue.
Perhaps a high Intelligence would allow a bard or mage to memorize faster.

I very much like the idea of songs, like spells, being searched out.  While
you will learn certain songs at level gain, the truly wonderful/interesting
ones will be hard to find, rumors being tracked down, fierce guardians
defeated.  This gives the EQ team a chance to continue expanding the
song/spells list helping them balance a class with more songs, or weaken it
by releasing useless/highly specific songs/spells.

What determines a song's effects, besides the nature of the song? The skill
of the bard. Everquest lists some of the skills a bard uses on their site:
