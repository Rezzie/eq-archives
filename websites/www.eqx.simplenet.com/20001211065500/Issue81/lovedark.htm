Alhazred stepped back from the freshly killed skeleton. He took a breath and then bent down to salvage what he could from the corpse. Bone chips and a few copper pieces. <em>You will rise again my friend,</em> thought Alhazred, <em>but this time under my power</em>.
<br><br>
It had been only a few days since Alhazred had emerged from the Lodge of the Dead. His powers in necromancy were still weak, but he could feel them growing with every new kill. The bitterness and hate within him fuelled his passion. <em>They will pay for what they did</em>, he thought and he rose to his feet and strode off deeper into the Nektoulous Forest.
<br><br>
As he tracked his next kill Alhazred thought about those who he really wished to kill.  Those foul day-walking creatures he had seen when he was growing up. They had come when he and his childhood love X'zanne were playing in the hills above Neriak. They had cut her down as if she were bracken blocking their way and only the intervention of guards had spared him from a similar fate. Now, much stronger, he would seek out their kind and deliver the retribution they so richly deserved. His passion for revenge was so intense that it even disturbed his fellow brethren. For this reason he found it difficult to group up with others and thus painted the portrait of a lonely figure wandering amongst the sickly trees.
<br><br>
He did care for his own people and always stopped to help if any were lost or assailed by creatures that would overwhelm them. Therefore he stopped, on his way back through Neriak one day, when he heard a call for help. He turned in the direction of the voice and saw a young dark-elf woman. She was dressed in the barest rudiments of apparel. Obviously she was just starting out. Alhazred bowed before her and awaited her request.
<br><br>
"Help me I am lost," she said. Alhazred had seen this many times before. Indeed it was not long ago that we wandered around wide-eyed with no idea of where to go. He told her where she was and enquired where it was she wished to go. As it turned out she was seeking the Lodge of the Dead to see her guildmaster for the first time. Alhazred was also heading that way to buy spells and offered to show her the way.
<br><br>
As they walked through the dank passages and across bridges that spanned dark subterranean rivers, he learnt her name was Rafiki and she sought honour in the name of Neriak. Their journey was over before he gleamed much more and he bid her farewell as they reached the person she had come to see. He caught one more fleeting glance of her as he left and then put her to the back of his mind.
<br><br>
It was sometime later that their paths crossed again. Alhazred was fighting creatures deep in the forest and saw Rafiki go past. She wore armour and carried herself proudly into battle. As he saw her dispatch two creatures he could not fail to be impressed how much she had progressed since they had first met. As the battle ended he hailed her and told her how well she had fought. Her response took him by surprise. It was warm and very friendly. She called him 'My Lord' no one had ever called him that. The rapport was immediate. They talked for a while before the screams of an anguished dark-elf drew them into battle.
<br><br>
The next time that he saw Rafiki was whilst out hunting with two friends. He hadn't even noticed the transition he had undergone from solo voyager to sociable group member. He didn't realise that meeting Rafiki again had brought about this change. He asked the party leader to invite her to join, as she was good in battle. Join she did and soon they were chatting again, Alhazred almost blushing at Rafiki's complements as he grew more and more fond of her. He had been without warmth in his heart for so long that he didn't realise what was happening, didn't sense that he was falling in love. It was at the point of farewell as the hunt ended for the day, that he looked at her and for the first time thought just how beautiful she was. 
<br><br>
He didn't see Rafiki for some days after that. The stirrings in his heart continued and he carried on hunting and spell casting, still trying to understand the feelings that swirled and eddied throughout his very being. When he did see her she had yet more surprises for him. In fact what Rafiki has done was to lead Alhazred to the crossroads in his life….

While she had been away, Rafiki and done many noble acts. She had helped the weak and uncertain dark-elves to safety and to where they had wished to go in their journeys. She had saved them from certain death and had given them the guidance that they had so dearly needed. And she did this for no reward. She did it simply because it had been done for her and she wished to repay this kind act with kind deeds of her own. Her actions brought her to the attention of a guild, which did similar things for creatures all over Norrath. They had invited her to join and this she gladly did, even though it meant she might have to help races that were alien or even hostile to her. It was this news that she gave Alhazred which sent him into a turmoil of emotions.
<br><br>
Alhazred wrestled with Rafiki's news as they went off to hunt in the forest. He couldn't deny the way he felt about her any longer and had now realised from her kind words and physical touches that she felt the same way about him. This would be perfect, but he could still hear X'zanne, his childhood love screaming and reaching for him as she was slain by those which Rafiki now helped. How could he join such a guild? How could he be with the woman he so obviously loved when she might expect him to help her to help those for whom he only wished the cold of the grave?
<br><br>
He dismissed this turmoil, there were great dangers out in the woods and he needed to keep a clear mind. As the hunting progressed, Rafiki and he became closer and closer until all he could think of was taking her in his arms. He could stand this gamut of emotions no longer and as the party spread out in the woods, he quietly slipped away.
<br><br>
It was back at Neriak Commons that Rafiki finally caught up with him. She naturally was concerned and asked why he had left. Alhazred finally told her of everything that had happened in his life. Rafiki immediately took the blame upon herself, a noble act from one who would be expected to do no less. This what not the reaction Alhazred was expecting and he quickly forgot all his problems as the desire to comfort Rafiki dominated him. He told Rafiki that his heart belonged to her and she told him that her feelings towards him were the equal of his towards her. For the first time since it was ripped away from him all those years ago, Alhazred felt joy in his life and knew then things would never be the same again. At that moment he decided to join Rafiki in the guild and follow the path no matter where it might lead. Her way was the way of truth and love. She was the light in the darkness of his world. That was all he needed.
<br><br>
Rafiki's work took them far away from the safety of their homeland to meet two strangers who wished safe passage to Freeport. Alhazred came face to face with a halfling and a warrior. He found in their faces none of the rage and hatred he had seen years ago, only puzzlement tinged with distrust.
<br><br>
 The journey back to Freeport was fraught with danger and the party soon fought together as if they had been friends for years. Alhazred found trust and even affection for these two strange beings, but basking in the radiant glow of Rafiki's love he would have found goodness in the foulest ghoul . During one nasty encounter she was mortally wounded. Seeing this happen stirred up the old memories in Alhazred. This time however, he could act and Rafiki was saved. Seeing her nearly taken away from him, Alhazred felt the full force of the love between them. It was then and there, in that dangerous foreign land, in the presence of outsiders and that Alhazred went down on his knee and asked Rafiki to marry him. In that place far far away she accepted and their pact of love was sealed.
