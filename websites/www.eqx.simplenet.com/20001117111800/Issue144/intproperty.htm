    AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
    I started this essay writing in character as Nepenthia, it&#146;s quite likely 
    I&#146;d describe her as frequenting an inn in Freeport, or searching for 
    scrolls about Tunare, or perhaps even (as set out last week in that rather 
    silly poem about dresses) as initiating a quest to marry Aradune. It would 
    seem entirely natural to place Nep in Norrath, using the possibilities of 
    that huge and fascinating world for her stories because that is where Nep 
    now spends her time, meets her friends and experiences adventures. Even though 
    Nep wasn&#146;t born in Norrath, the place of her birth actually having been 
    a ship that sailed far, far away and long, long ago, she has traveled through 
    a variety of realms on her way there. In each of the places she has inhabited, 
    and currently in Everquest, it has always seemed natural to find her practicing 
    her bardic craft using the images, history, geography and characters she has 
    found. How else could she connect her ongoing history with others of the citizens 
    in the communities? How else could she grow and find a life and personality 
    of her own if not from the worlds she experienced and the relationships she 
    formed within them?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
    seen above, Neppie is obviously a role-playing character, developed to allow 
    her creator to participate in role-playing MUDs and games. However, the recent 
    banning from Everquest of a role-player who wrote background stories as a 
    means of trying to fully develop his characters, brings up some major issues 
    about where and when and how I (or others with their own role-play characters) 
    can role-play and/or publish stories or poems about Nepenthia and the world 
    she finds herself in right now, Norrath. After all, I, as the creator of Nep, 
    am in Norrath because Verant developed a role-playing game. They opened the 
    doors to the realms, inviting me and thousands of others to purchase their 
    Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game software and to come into their 
    world and role-play. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
    it is true that Verant partly enabled me to introduce Nep to Everquest by 
    using the computer code to decide on Nep&#146;s looks, her gender, her stats, 
    her race, her class and her religion, that really is only a limited start 
    to developing a character. In order to role-play my character, it is necessary 
    to flesh her out . Beyond the effects given by the software code, it&#146;s 
    up to me to figure out what to do with her. Of course, I could choose to narrow 
    my definition of role-play to simply the creation of the figure, Nep, and 
    I could choose to run her around Norrath focused on accumulating in-game computer-generated 
    rewards. The computer will actually accomplish that goal for me as long as 
    I press the right keys. What the computer will not and cannot do though is 
    create a role for Nep set in the Norrathian history and geography, nor can 
    it give her personality, speech, connections and relationships. I am her creator 
    and it is both my play and pleasure to develop those aspects for her in game 
    and to more thoroughly solidify her existence through the use of the traditional 
    role-play tools of background stories, current tales of adventures, art, poems, 
    etc., possibly published on non-Everquest-owned sites like this one. However, 
    the moment I write or draw anything that connects Nep with her current role-play 
    environment, i.e., Norrath, even if it is not posted on a Verant or Sony site, 
    I am potentially in danger of being found in violation of the EULA and the 
    Terms of Conduct (which maintain a contractual relationship between me as 
    a player and Verant/Sony as the game software provider) and copyright or other 
    intellectual property laws. I, as her creator, could suffer the repercussions 
    of this even though she is being role-played in a world created solely for 
    the purpose of inducing me and others to purchase entry into it to play our 
    characters and even though any publications I make (such as the ones here 
    on EQ Express) are not on any Sony-owned sites as specified in the Terms of 
    Conduct.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
    matters stand, it seems like role-players must either have a sophisticated 
    understanding of both intellectual property law and contract law in order 
    to publish any works about their characters and stay in good standing in Everquest, 
    or they must have reliable, clear and legal guidelines within which they may 
    choose to work. If they do not have either, then they must face the possibility 
    that anything they create that links their character with the world of Everquest, 
    whether by a few words or by many, might get them banned from play or worse. 
    Sadly, already some fan-sites are suspending publication simply because they 
    feel it is not worth sharing their role-play stories with others if it means 
    that they might be prevented from playing at all. Also and equally sadly, 
    players are deciding to remove their characters from Everquest because they 
    feel that the invitation to role-play there has, in essence, been rescinded 
    or weighted with such restrictions and tonalities of possible censorship that 
    it makes playing there an ethically untenable position. Role-players are perceiving 
    that the activities traditionally associated with their gaming, if used in 
    a virtual world created for profit, may endanger their ability to play in 
    that world. They are also finding that, in fact, the expression of the creativity 
    that is the mark of excellent role-playing may actually become a barrier excluding 
    them seeing themselves as a part of a game community. As the famed bard Jythri 
    stated in his goodbye message, &#147;It&#146;s clear to me now that it is 
    &#145;your world&#148;. I will never be able to call it mine.&#148;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beyond 
    the uniquely personal issues that role-players may experience from identifying 
    with the author&#146;s dilemma, the banning has raised a complexity of issues, 
    some of which are new to the courts as they arise out of what is an at-times 
    &#147;extra-legal&#148; environment on the internet. This incident began when 
    a person published a role-playing story, using a scant few references to Everquest 
    content, several months ago on a third-party server. At the time of publication, 
    the site did not object to the story&#146;s content, nor did they ever receive 
    any communication from Verant or Sony about it. Much later, apparently on 
    the basis of the story&#146;s content and then, later, on the basis of infringement 
    of intellectual property, the author through his player account was banned 
    from Everquest without notice. Out of this situation have arisen several major 
    issues and several difficult questions. The issues identified by player posts 
    so far include the following: breach of contract between Verant/Sony and the 
    player (governed by contract law in the civil courts); intellectual property 
    disputes applying both to this matter and to all those who write EQ related 
    articles or stories or who maintain EQ related websites (especially focused 
    on copyright law and the, as yet, unsettled position of fan fiction); discrimination 
    of a business against the content of writing by only one person while allowing 
    others unhindered publication (possibly laws controlling the ability of a 
    business to discriminate); and harassment (as in using the severing of a contractual 
    relationship as a means to retaliate against someone a company disagrees with 
    or doesn&#146;t like). There are questions too. Can a corporation face legal 
    challenges to its policing actions beyond its domain? Can a player&#146;s 
    behavior beyond the domain of Sony be grounds for ending a contractual business 
    relationship founded on a license to use software? Can Verant legally set 
    guidelines for or censor fan-fiction or even end it? Can Verant set rules 
    for acceptable ways to role-play when not in its domain? Can EQ fan fiction 
    published outside of Everquest/Sony sites be grounds for ending the contractual 
    software use relationship between it and the writer if the writer is a customer 
    of Sony? Should responses to reactions (such as a parent&#146;s) to a third-party 
    site publication that may invoke the world of Norrath be policed by Sony even 
    if Sony has no actual ability or legal responsibility to do so. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
    anyone might guess, I don&#146;t have answers to all these questions, nor 
    does Nep. In fact, she would prefer to retire to a nice soft bed about now 
    to dream sweetly and she isn&#146;t too fussy about what fantasy city the 
    inn is in. I intend to sleep on it too and think about it some more, hoping 
    to get a clearer view of whether or not it is safe for me to write about Nepenthia 
    or other characters and still remain a player in Norrath. In the meantime, 
    if Jythri has indeed left Everquest, I&#146;d like to simply say thanks for 
    the role-playing, the Soerbaird and the products of his creativity. He has 
    made my life richer and I deeply appreciate it. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    As a final note, there are some very helpful sites on the net to help each 
    of us try to muddle through the maze of legalities and fan-fiction problems. 
    Oghma has kindly furnished several site addresses for me and I pass them along 
    to you. Especially helpful were </font></p>
