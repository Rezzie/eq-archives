    <big><big>I</big></big>t was not easy to come up with something to write for this fine
    magazine. But recently I caught an undercurrent in the ebb and flow of the Avault
    EverQuest newsgroup. A subtle thing that maybe only I can feel, and therefore may not
    actually exist. But my nerves have been raw and exposed seeking something interesting to
    write about. I have sensed the potential for disaster in this great new endeavor called
    EverQuest. A ripple in the reality into which I hope to someday immerse myself. I seek in
    this writing to calm the ripples, ease the rocking concern in my mind, by exposing these
    nerves to the community that shares my wishes for a second home in Norrath.<br>
    <p>First be warned. I am going to talk about... THE SWITCH! I have chosen to call it the
    Universal Player Interaction switch (UPI) on the strength of a suggestion made in the
    newsgroup by someone very smart whose name I no longer remember. Sorry 'bout that.<br>
    </p>
    <p>However, I have no intention of discussing the virtues or disadvantages of such a
    switch &lt;reader&nbsp; sighs&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; relief&gt;.&nbsp;&nbsp; What
    &nbsp; I </td>
    <td style="text-align: justify" width="242"><br>
    want to tell you about is a sense that I have that we are setting ourselves up to rend
    Norrath. I expected to find Norrath a place divided. But divided among the many races,
    professions and desires of its inhabitants. Now I fear that it will be split by external
    forces, us, the players. <br>
    <p>The UPI switch will exist in our role-playing environment. By its very nature it will
    separate us into two groups. But that separation is mechanical and should be kept apart
    from the characters, left in our world and out of Norrath as much as possible. But I have
    sensed a trend. It seems that we are expecting our characters to treat each other based
    first on how their switch is set, not on their race, class, sex or point of view. I am not
    espousing any sort of &quot;ism&quot; in our role-playing. Nothing more than the roles
    require. But any sexism that a barbarian may feel is certainly more valid in the character
    than any sort of evaluation or bias that one character might feel toward another based on
    the setting of his/her switch.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In discussions about the potential of EverQuest,&nbsp; we&nbsp; have&nbsp; talked
    &nbsp; about </td>
    <td style="text-align: justify" width="242"><br>
    <br>
    justice and how it should apply to our characters. We have talked about racial solidarity.
    We have talked about many issues. In these discussions I have been hearing, or maybe
    sensing, something. It sounds like all of us, deep in our subconsciences, are envisioning
    a Norrath where the first thing we notice about another person is the position of his/her
    switch. I know that I just realized this in myself. Now this, by itself, is an acceptable
    price to pay for the potential good that this switch can bring. But what if it goes too
    far? Suppose that non-UPI characters refuse to hang around UPI characters? Suppose the
    reverse also happens? It could. Let's imagine that we are playing a dedicated non-UPI
    character.<br>
    <p>He/she may want to avoid traveling with UPI characters to avoid the risk of losing
    his/her non-UPI status by helping a UPI character. What if this becomes common? It could.
    What if UPI characters tended to avoid non-UPI characters because they would not be of any
    use against other PCs in a fight. Maybe this would feel unfair to the UPI character. It
    could happen.<br>
