Galm felt all sorts of tension between himself and the rest of the adventurers during the last leg of the sea voyage.  He heard the others laughing and joking, and could sense the way that they forced the jovial sounds from their lips.  Galm couldn't bring himself to act so happy.  And he couldn't shake the feeling that a lot of their laughter had something to do with him.  How could he admit a desire to protect Fealwin in front of all of those strangers?  How could he admit something that he wasn't even aware of until the moment he spoke?  How could he allow this journey to make such a change in his life?
<br><br>
Galm was overwhelmed to see land three days after the ceremony.  Sitting idly on the boat, avoiding everyone, was driving him mad.  He hoped that once they touched land again there would be enough work to keep him busy.
<br><br>
But there wasn't.  The sailors became porters and unloaded the supplies from the hold.  They glared at him when he carried one of the boxes of food to shore.  The load was easy for him, he was much stronger than the strongest of the Erudite sailors.  But he knew when he wasn't wanted, and he busied himself by unloading and then cleaning his personal equipment.  He climbed up on one of the large flat rocks that dotted the shoreline and performed his work in silence.  Occasionally he would stop to look at the landscape.  The was the same as it always was, and wasn't a sight that he savored.  So he turned himself inland and tried to peer deeply into the interior of Kunark.
<br><br>
The shoreline was marked by thirty to fifty feet of slowly rising sand.  The sand was dotted with boulders, many of them larger than a giant's head.  All of them were flat, as if they had been only soft clay when some heavenly force dropped them upon the beach.  Where the sand ended, rough pale grasses began. There was a bit of wind running along the beach, but the grass was so gnarly that it didn't even ruffle.  The long blades of grass curled like freakish fingers, clutching anything nearby.  Thick but dull, the grass seemed to be trying to push the sand into the water with its barely green fingers.  As the grass went inland it covered low, rolling hills.  Galm's perch was too flat to see much beyond those hills.  But when he stood up on his toes he was able to discern the tops of trees.  They seemed green enough, but with his non-existent forestry skills, he could not tell what type of tree they were.
<br><br>
"I'm anxious to see what's out there as well."  Galm turned to see the Human bard, Hautin, leaning against his perch.  The musician was darned quiet to have been able to creep up on him like that.  A distinct change from his lack of agility aboard the ship.  "This should be an interesting journey, not that it hasn't been already.  I can't believe that we've done it, we've crossed the ocean!  I've always had faith in Omonero, but I guess I had to see it to believe it..."
<br><br>
Hautin stopped talking, probably in response to Galm's scowl.  "You talk a lot, don'cha?"
<br><br>
"It is my job, after all."
<br><br>
"Listenin' to it ain't mine."
<br><br>
"True enough.  I'll leave you to your work."
<br><br>
"Wait..."  Again Galm wasn't really certain what he would say next.  He had hundreds of questions, about Kunark, about the Erudites and their motives, about the wizard Roawed, and bards are supposed to know a lot of things about people and places...  "What have I gotten myself into here?  What's out in that forest?"
<br><br>
Hautin smirked, "How the hell am I supposed to know?  Nobody has been here in thousands of years.  But I can tell you what Omonero and Roawed expect to find.  I've known them a long time.  In fact, I'm the one that brought them together for this.  Roawed, well, he expects to find ruins.  He talks about the wars that happened just before the continent was lost.  He talks about how all of the High Elven spell casters were destroyed, either by the power of a god, or by their own foolishness, he's not certain."
<br><br>
"High Elves?  Here?"
<br><br>
"Yes, back then anyway.  But most scholars, including myself up until recently, think they all died during that great war.  But Omonero thinks otherwise, and so does your brother.  The people that Tunare told Fealwin about, those that even now fight the evil that we are here to stop, they believe them to be High Elves descended from those ancient peoples.  That makes sense enough to me.  But what the evil is, nobody can guess."
<br><br>
Glam held up his hand to forestall any further wanderings.  "I'm more interested in what sorta monsters live here.  What am I gonna need to kill?"
<br><br>
Hautin shook his head.  "That, I really don't know."
<br><br>
They talked a while longer, about things that seemed meaningless to Galm.  When the bard left him to jog back to the group gathering around a fresh pit fire on the beach, Galm stared after him.  Why did he find himself trapped on a dangerous new continent with a bunch of people that had some sort of power over him.  Even drunk he'd never spent that long talking about nothing with anyone.  Small talk was not one of the skills that he had ever practiced.  It was usually something that he actively avoided.
<br><br>
He shook his head and hopped down from the rock.  It was getting late, and he was getting cold.  Despite his desire to avoid his companions, he wasn't going to sit out in the cold to do it.
<br><br>
Galm trudged up to the large circle of people gathered around the main fire.  There were several smaller fires springing to life around them.  The sailors slipped away from the main fire to gathering around these fires, leaving the adventurers by themselves after a few minutes.  The sailors were just like any others, and soon enough Galm could hear them telling tales, cursing and calling each other names.  It made for a comforting background noise to the conversation that was taking place near him.
<br><br>
"So, which way will we travel in the morning?"
<br><br>
"That's a fine question, Hautin.  One that we just don't have an answer to.  If all goes well, Tunare will guide us to our destination."  That was Fealwin.  Her faith was always her guide.
<br><br>
"Perhaps we should decide where we go on our own, just in case."  Roawed spoke with just a bit of humor in his voice.  Not that anything he said would anger Fealwin, nor shake her faith in the slightest.  She simply smiled.  "I suggest that we head into the forest.  <b>If</b> there are any of my people here, they'll be in the forest, someplace.  The least we should find there will be what is left of their cities.  Perhaps we can find their libraries, and their records."
<br><br>
"And maybe their magics..."  Glind muttered just loud enough for Galm to overhear.
<br><br>
"That seems a reasonable course of action.  I still think it is a shame that none of your fellow Elves with tracking skills could be convinced to come along."  This was the first words that Galm had heard from Foram, Omonero's student and also a priest to Prexus.  Foram was very tall, even for an Erudite.  And even though Omonero seemed arrogant beyond even his power as a high priest, Foram was twice as arrogant.
<br><br>
"The rangers felt that it was more important to continue the fight against the multitude of evil that we already have than to go looking for more of it," Fealwin responded.
<br><br>
"And they didn't trust us..."
<br><br>
"That's true as well.  But fear was not the deciding factor for them.  At least not fear of death.  They feared that they would be leaving behind the Mother in coming here.  And they have much work to do, trying to track down those wizards.  They may just be able to destroy this evil before we solve it here."  Galm refused to look at Fealwin as she spoke.
<br><br>
Omonero spoke up then, his voice quiet but insistent, "We've been over this before...  over and over it.  It seems that we will be heading into the forest in the morning.  Let's get some sleep for now."
<br><br>
Omonero, Foram and the female Erudite enchanter named Syan, actually went back to the boat to sleep.  Galm shook his head at their choice.  Something that he found himself doing a lot over the last week.  He was still shaking his head when he finally fell asleep on the beach, on the shores of Kunark.
