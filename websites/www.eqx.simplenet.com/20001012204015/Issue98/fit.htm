<b> -- Freeport</b>
<br><br>
Hoi there all... Lrets D'pearl here with the latest from Freeport. I must say scoops have been fairly difficult to come by lately (Darn Verant programmers are doing their jobs an' making hard for me :P) but fear not!!! I was able to scrape up SOMETHING to tide ye folks over for this week. First off... I was off to the Eastern quarter of Freeport to investigate a new, major breakthrough in preservation magics. Apparently those enchanters over at the Academy of Arcane Sciences have come up with a spell that will make any object impervious to rain, sleet, snow, lava, and even time. Sounds pretty incredible eh? Well as you would know it ... in the excitement of the moment while testing the spell out, the mage in charge of casting the spell missed the test subject for the spell and somehow sent the energy bolt flying OUT the Academy window. To date, the mages have no idea what was hit by the spell, and greatly fear the consequences of any unresearched side effects the spell may have. Freeport militia are on guard around the clock to discover any unusual occurrences within the city. I, on the other hand, using my exquisite scooping skills have come up with a potential candidate for what may have been the lucky recipient of that spell's effects. Next time ye'r walking around the Academy of Arcane Sciences make sure to take a gander at the lil' turd a lil' way down the road from the Academy ... have ye notice that the stinky lil' pile has been there for quite some time? :) Yeesh!!!

Well ... that's all for now ... we'll see what else I can dig up around Freeport for ye next time ... until then ... This is Lrets D'pearl Aspiring Bard Extraordinaire and Freelance Cub Reporter for EQ Express asking all those inkies on Vallon Zek to PLEASE leave me alone while I'm trying to get a scoop :P Yeesh! Can't tell ye how many times I was kilt while trying to line up for a nice shot :)
