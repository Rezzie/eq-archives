HALAS -
<br><br>
Long believe only a legend, earlier this week a group of barbarians travelling the Permafrost peaks claim to have come across the remains of the Abominable Ice Goblin.  According to reports, the bones of the goblin would put him at some six feet tall, making him the tallest and most fearsome ice goblin in existence.

OCEAN OF TEARS -
<br><br>
There have been rumors of a gigantic shark in the Ocean of Tears.  Not only is this shark supposed to be tremendously large, it is also rumored to fly.  It has been sighted by reliable and not too drunken sources hovering over the ocean.  When asked, Gnomish scholars would only laugh at the notion.  Erudin magicians, however, have tales of such a beast, though they would not share them with us.  The few that we spoke to left immediately for the Ocean of Tears.  They would not speak with us further.
