There is a point beyond exhaustion, where you know that your feet can hurt no longer and where your lungs simply fulfill their obligation to the rest of your body, unable to do anything but push and pull at the icy air again and again.  That's not to say that if you run long and far enough you can keep running forever; Quite the opposite.  I knew that once I'd reached that point that it wasn't much longer before I'd collapse and that one of my pursuers would find me.
<br><br>
For the past few miles I had considered that capture and execution might be preferable to the pains coming from the blisters on my bare feet or to the raging of the heart which pounded at the walls of my chest as if seeking escape.  The blessing of "tranquility" that exhaustion had wrought had removed those thoughts temporarily.
<br><br>
I was still far from home, but I couldn't tell exactly how far.  On the plains of Karana the trees and rocks begin to look the same, especially when you are nowhere near the path.  I had started out on the path, but the delusions that accompany my condition had set in a few times as I looked up to see massive wings fluttering in the distance.  Fearing one of the Karana's infamous Griffins I had turned off the path and become hopelessly lost.  Best as my senses could tell me, I was still headed in the general direction of Qeynos, but who knows.
<br><br>
It would take them no time to find me with that ranger assisting them.  I could only imagine that the reason they were not yet on me was because that since they travel in a group they were more obviously spotted by some of the local beasts.  At least that's what I hoped.
<br><br>
It wasn't more than a few minutes after this thought that I heard the dogs.  There wasn't too much cover here and I decided to make my way toward a copse of trees.  Once I arrived there I stood behind a tree and glanced back into the distance.  In the complete dark of this moonless night I could see the figures only because of their torches, but there were more torches than I was prepared to see.  Four or five.  Some of these men as I recalled used shields and swords, and that meant that I was looking at a minimum of 8 men and at least two dogs.
<br><br>
I had concealed myself from animals before, but it's not an easy proposition, and with all this running I undoubtedly was exuding a more offensive scent.  I found a small well at the base of a tree between the massive roots and sat there, pulling leaves in over myself.  The pack continued up the small slope toward the copse of trees, the dogs pulling them onward at leash length.  At last the pack stopped. They were undoubtedly looking for signs of an ambush, as if I were to make a last stand out in this forsaken land, this was certainly the best spot.
<br><br>
I heard a few words in a strange tongue, perhaps some barbarian dialect, and then the dogs began to bark wildly.  Next thing I knew, the sounds of paws beating the earth rapidly and the growing clamor of barking and snarling made me shiver.  They had unleashed the dogs, and they were more than happy to charge into the darkness of this grove.
<br><br>
When they reached the trees and began to sniff around, that was when I was met with a most unexpected sound.  One of the dogs let out a loud yelp and then fell silent.  There was a sound like rain for just a few seconds then the other dog turned and ran.  His sounds became more distant as he fled.
<br><br>
I was too fearful to open my eyes at that moment.  There was a slight increase in the wind here, and sounds that a fertile mind might perceive as meat being torn.  This last sound was too far from the group for them to hear it.
<br><br>
They discussed whatever trap I had set.  At last they all began to advance on the copse of trees, their common sense telling them that one man could not take them all.
<br><br>
The breeze was still there and seemed to brush against me in pulses.  The whole grove seemed alive and its lungs, like my own, were pulling at the air.
<br><br>
A few made the edge of the trees then waited for the ones with torches to get closer.
<br><br>
It was then, as I began to see a glow through my eyelids that I decided to glance up, to witness the coming of my persecutors.  What happened next had my senses reeling for a few moments while I tried to make sense of the incident.  The figure before me was staring my direction, discerning the shapes from the shadows, when he suddenly became airborn.  But not as if struck and thrown across the plains; no, he was drawn straight up into the air, and as with the dog, a small rainshower commenced, but only for a few seconds, as his blood sprayed over the immediate area.
<br><br>
The others looked up into the canopy of limbs and leaves and at last made some sense of the shape there.  There was a collective gasp and then that same canopy of limbs and branches began to come alive, swirling and swinging at the men who stood there gaping.
<br><br>
They turned and began to back off, but for the ranger who drew his sword and stumbled backwards with the force of the wind.  He raised his shield and drew his sword back as if to strike at the attacking limbs, but then his arm seemed to come loose and fly backward, still clutching the sword.  I had seen a dark shape reach from the trees and strike, but with an agility I'd never experienced.  The ranger howled and fell to the ground beside his severed limb, as if it were a lost weapon and he were trying to figure out how to re-equip it.
<br><br>
Then limbs became less agitated and a dark shadow fell over the pack of men who began to simply turn and run for their lives.  A tremendous, pulsing shadow, like the heart of the darkness in this copse of trees were pursuing them across the plains.
<br><br>
I pulled myself free from my hiding place and stepped to the edge of the trees to watch them scurry away.  Of all the places to select a hiding place, I had chosen a grove which was home to a Griffin, and perhaps the largest griffin I had ever even heard tale of.
<br><br>
Seems my attempts to hide myself had been sufficient not only to keep away these predatory humans, but to hide me from the wrath of the enormous winged beast.
<br><br>
Not to sound too heartless, the same voice deep inside me that told me to steal the sword from the merchant back in Halas was telling me to take the bits of abandoned weaponry that littered the ground.  I began to strip the armor from the ranger and stuff all the pieces into his backpacks.
<br><br>
Dawn began.  There was sufficient light to travel safely now.  I glanced off toward the direction of Qeynos, where they had fled with the griffin in pursuit, and turned toward Highhold pass and began to march toward the bridge to East Karana.
<br><br>
I've heard it said among the priests at various temples that the evils one culminates shall come back to plague them.  To this point, I've not seen such wrath.  I had stolen a sword, fled from a group of men across the continent of Antonica, and gotten numerous of their kind slain by a griffin.  And now I had even more treasure to sell.
<br><br>
Perhaps there was a reckoning coming for me, but not today.  I strolled off across the plains secure in the knowledge that my pursuers were either adorning the belly of the griffin or back in Halas, huddling safely in their homes.
