Too much realism?  When does it go too far?<br>
Don't know if you have had this topic yet, but the conversation Russell and I have been having about combat for non-pvp area attacks, combined with the recent lumber jacking etc., skills being brought up, I thought it would be interesting.</em>
<br><br>
Well, I admit to not having read those threads, and therefore I'll have to guess what they entailed.  But guessing is half the fun with this column.
<br><br>
Well, really, it can go too far.  Too far would be forcing me to find a restroom, or a bush, every so often so that my character doesn't wet himself.  Too far is penalizing me on my character's dexterity because I feel uncomfortable for using some very rough leaves instead of some nice soft paper.  Too far would be forcing me to stop to tie my shoes...
<br><br>
But what about the idea of non-pvp area attacks?  <em>Here's where I guess</em> - I guess that you are talking about a scene like this:
<br><br>
Bongo, Basher and Flimsy are wandering in the woods.  Bongo is a clod, and stomps into the Big Orc Camp (entirely missing the warning sign).  The Orcs are miffed.  After all, it's bingo night, and they take it very seriously.  So Bongo finds himself swarmed with unpleasant smelling Orcs.  Basher, true to his name, rushes into the fray, looking for something to hit with his big stick.  But Flimsy is a spell caster.  He hangs back and watches.  Just as Flimsy begins to snore, Bongo starts yelling at him, threatening to bring the party over there if he doesn't do something to help.  Flimsy raises his weary head to see that his two friends (and personal shields) are taking a beating.  So he stands, dusts himself off, and strains to remember the key words to his spells...   "Shazaam!"  That wasn't it...  "Open Ses..."  no, no...  "Blammo!"  And with that word, a huge ball of fire appears, engulfing all the combatants.
<br><br>
Sneaky, the rogue, was hiding nearby.  He is waiting for the smoke to clear, and for Flimsy to nod off again, so that he can pick through the remains.  But when the smoke clears, he is baffled to find that Bongo and Basher are completely unharmed by the flames, and that all the Orcs are in varying forms of crispy.  Bongo smacks the last groaning Orc, and starts looting the corpses.  Sneaky is a bit upset.  How the heck did those two survive that incredible blast?  Especially since the Orcs were obviously the tougher creatures?
<br><br>
Not too realistic?  Nope.  Worse yet, if Flimsy had continued to snore, but Sneaky, being +pvp, decided to help out.  While he is sneaking up on the Orc Chieftain, Frizzle, a +pvp magician, also decides to help.  So the ensuing ball of fire toasts Sneaky and the Orcs, but leaves Bongo and Basher untouched.  Or what if Flimsy <em>did</em> wake up at the last moment, and both mages cast a fireball...
<br><br>
Well, yeah, it's not realistic at all.  But it's a function of the switch.  It's also the main thing that bothers me about it.  Flimsy has no reason to be a good spell caster.  He does not have to worry about hitting his friends.  He, basically, becomes a flawless tactician.  Not only is it unrealistic, it's not very challenging.  I wish that the Internet was a place where things like PKing and d00dz did not exist.  But they do.  And we will have to suffer some loss of realism in order to reduce the hazardous affects these things cause us.  Give us freedom, and give us...  d00dz?
<br><br>
And we've heard a lot about the non-combat skills lately.  Some folks hear even a whisper of woodcutting, weaponsmithing, or merchant skills, and they start screaming about too much realism.  Folks, here's the key.  "Realism" is not a part of the equation.  Nobody is trying to make EverQuest into a "realistic" game.  At least not in the way that most folks seem to define it.
<br><br>
Realism:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  fidelity in art and literature to nature or to real life and to accurate representation without idealization.
<br><br>
989 Studios is not going to make a game that is an accurate representation of real life.  I think the real trouble I have with this whole thing is that nobody will use the right term.
<br><br>
Consistency:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agreement or harmony of parts or features to one another or a whole.
<br><br>
The game needs to be consistent with the genre and consistent within itself.  That's why there will be a name filter.  John Holmes is a realistic name for a character, but not a consistent one.  It's not consistent with the game.  But I digress...
<br><br>
I am very much in favor of non-combat skills.  I am even in favor of non-combat classes.  Folks seem to think that these skills will ruin the game.  They could, I suppose, if you were forced to use them and you did not want to.  If the game forced me to wield a big sword and wear plate mail armor, I would have a problem.  But making a place in the game for players that want such things is not only reasonable, it's desirable.  Same goes for non-combat skills.
<br><br>
So, yes, the inclusion of "realism" in EverQuest could certainly go too far.  Especially if pushed to the extent of asking for automobiles because they are "realistic".  But you and I both know that such things are not consistent, and are foolish ideas used to push the idea to it's ridiculous extreme.  But the game could never be too consistent.
<br><br>
Let's change terms.  Smack the next person that says that EverQuest is not realistic enough.  Slap the next one that says it's too realistic.  In know you can do that, Onnie.  :P
<br><br>
Thanks for the idea. Let's have more EXPRESSions ideas!
