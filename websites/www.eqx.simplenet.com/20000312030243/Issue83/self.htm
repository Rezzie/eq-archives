Oh my, these were indeed the dark days.
<br><br>
I'm not sure what all lead up to T'davens not-all-that-unexpected breakdown.  I recall his sister, T'danye, speaking to Gainam in the chapel one day.  It was an unusual place to see her, as she held little reverence for the sacred.  She believed in Innoruuk, and properly feared him, as we all do, but she was not one to visit his temples.
<br><br>
I know of this visit because I had come to visit Gainam that morning.  He had a tendency to goad me about my promptness (or lack thereof) and when he showed up late I took it upon myself to begin taking confessions for him.  I sat down in the shadows room off of the vestibule and put on the confessioner's hood.  After the first couple of dull witted merchants came in and boasted their sins to me, Innoruuk's "Appointed", I admonished them properly for not fulfilling their duties in some way.  I know the way these priests talk just enough to fake it.  I tossed out the proper terminology, and since the priests are never satisfied with the activities of their parishioners, no matter how dastardly they are, it was easy to simply say, "That is well done, but Innoruuk expects more".  Whereupon I'd instruct them to go flagellate themselves until they see the image of Innoruuk clearly and hear his words.
<br><br>
I hear one of the men is not expected to live.
<br><br>
But it was at this third visitor that I began to enjoy the job and could understand why one might become a priest.  She was a child of one of the guards.  I think her name was L'ania, and she was well beyond the age of sexual attainment, but most feared her father and his influence with the indigo brotherhood.  She told me how men would cross the commons and glance away in order to avoid her because of her father's reputation.
<br><br>
It took less than five minutes for this lovely flower to unfold for me.  We were in the thrall of our passions.  I think I was adjusting to a position called "Innoruuk's Grasp" which I'd once studied from a book.  So I  bite her shoulder blade and she digs her teeth into my abdomen (It's not an easy position and takes practice), and I find myself briefly wondering why I never entered the priesthood.  Perhaps it's that chastity thing that many undertake.  She didn't seem to care.
 <br><br>
I think it was the mask.  Chicks dig the mask.
<br><br>
I was about to toss the girl aside and dress myself when I heard Gainam answer T'danye.  I guess they decided to use the pews rather than the confession room, so we continued our activities, the small statue of Innoruuk watching us intently, my hand cupped over the girl's mouth so that I can hear the conversation in the next room over her panting.
<br><br>
I'll relay now what I could make out of the muffled discussion.
<br><br>
"He's getting worse," Gainam said.
<br><br>
"Is there nothing we can do for him," said the Lovely T'danye.
<br><br>
"All that you can do is remove him from here.  Take him someplace where he will not be reminded of halflings, gnomes, or any of the other pigeon races.  And keep him from the other F'leurs DuMal for a while.  They are another reminder."
<br><br>
"I know someone in the necromancer's guild.  Time was, T'daven loved to obsess on death.  Perhaps I can get them to keep him a while, in secrecy and he can sit in their dank cells, perhaps even wander the graves where they bury and then reclaim their undead charges."
<br><br>
"It might indeed prove uplifting to him," Gainam said without a hint of irony, as if living among the living dead were the natural way of mad men.
<br><br>
My concentration was a bit off, what with trying to hear the discussion, and I accidentally marked the girl.  It was just a small bruise, but it was inconveniently placed on her chin.  This didn't bode well.  Her father was going to know that something happened.
<br><br>
So I missed the rest of the conversation.  But I'm sure it involved who would assume lead of the F'leurs DuMal in T'daven's absence.
<br><br>
I helped the young lady back into her cloths and looked at the mark on her chin, shaking my head.
<br><br>
"I'm going to have to tell my father that I was raped, else he think less of me."
<br><br>
"I understand," I replied, "be sure to tell him the confessioner did it."
<br><br>
She walked out, her walk somewhat less taught than when she came in.  I breathed the essence of wild toadstool she had left behind, and took off the confessioner's mask, hanging it back on its hook.
<br><br>
"Good day, Gainam," I said, walking into the chapel where he knelt facing away from me, his hands pressing hard into the spiked carpet at the foot of the large statue of Innoruuk.  I strolled out the door.
<br><br>
I'm not sure that he even remembered we had a meeting planned.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
"Extra…. Listen here!" the newsboy said from his perch outside the tavern, "Confessioner slain!  Believed victim of leatherfoot!  Even church is not safe, say town guards."
<br><br>
This was immensely amusing for obvious reasons.  "Leatherfoot blamed" is typically code.  It means that someone with political clout committed the killing and it will remain unsolved.  So naturally, we blame the halflings for such unsolved crimes.
<br><br>
I paid the boy a copper and kept walking without taking a paper.
<br><br>
We met at the blind fish, downstairs.  I think Sinen and Nuuin escorted a couple of their drinking/paying customers out by the seats of their pants.  This upset the owner of the bar, but he wasn't about to take it up with them.
<br><br>
I kept waiting for them to escort out the other dozen or so people who I did not recognize.  I was surprised when Sinen began the meeting and I simply settled in at the bar.  Even on the worst day of his life, I can elicit a smile from the bartender, because when he sees me he sees only silver and hears the clank of coins.  Bartenders the world over love me.
<br><br>
It was thirty minutes of discussion about the future of the guild.  It appears that T'danye had shown up recently and given notice that for her brother's health they were both quitting the guild.
<br><br>
This was more than a little disheartening, I must say.  T'daven was the guild's heart.  He was a man so singularly in love with the ideal of making Neriak free of outsiders that he galvanized the original group into action.  Most of these people I didn't even know now.  Indeed, some of them looked familiar from casual encounter in town and out in the forest of Nektulos.  A few I had even seen speaking to trolls and ogres.  I simply purchased a double for my next drink.
<br><br>
Gainam came in halfway through the meeting and it's discussions of what we were to do as a group.  I could read the surprised recognition on his face as well.  I'd gotten mine over with thirty minutes earlier and drowned the thought in cheap fish ale.  Gainam walked up to me, downed his customary full cup of dark ale, and said to me, "Who are these people".
<br><br>
I shrugged, put my money down on the counter and headed for the door.
<br><br>
"Does it matter?" I asked.  Some questions are better left unasked.
<br><br>
I heard later from another meeting attendee that the rest of the meeting was much the same, with discussions of obligations and goals.  I counted the change in my belt pouch and decided my goal was to see how drunk I could get on thirty-two silver and a few scraps of lint.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
There was a shuffling of feet and a smack as something large collided with wood somewhere outside the door.  I could smell my own vomit, which was somewhere in the dark room with me.  Someone else moved too.  It was too large to be one of the Maiden's Fancy's championship size rats.  I smelled enough heather and lilac to know that it was probably one of the serving girls.  The ones who have a lot of… well, "customer contact" wear large amounts of flower scent as a cover-up.
<br><br>
The door opened and collided with the wall.  I could see several people leaving the other rooms and sliding past the figure in the doorway.  It was Gainam, who particularly detested the Maiden's Fancy for its employment of Ogres as bouncers upstairs.  I could now see the girl on the bed beside me.  Gainam seized her by her arm and plucked her from the bed unceremoniously.  She moved to object but his stare stifled her.  He released her wholly unclothed out into the hallway and she headed to the bar looking for something to wear.
<br><br>
I sat up on one elbow, squinting at the light that framed the doorway.
<br><br>
"Trouble?" I said.
<br><br>
"The guild is coming apart.  They don't know the <em>meaning</em> of the word <em>cleanse</em>.  We must do something."
<br><br>
"T'daven could do something.   Even T'danye could," I proffered.
<br><br>
"She has sworn me to secrecy about him.  And she will do nothing; She blames the guild for his condition."
<br><br>
"She was a party to the guild's creation."
<br><br>
"Yes," Gainam nodded, "and she blames herself for the way he's gotten.  She won't do anything to undo that."
<br><br>
I stood up and stretched, putting on my clothes.
<br><br>
"So you ask perhaps the world's champion letharge," I said, creating a term I felt described my state of mind.  I nodded and we exited.
<br><br>
"Perhaps you need incentive," he said, the machinations of his head rolling forward on a path so exact that one might mistake him for a gnome clockwork. "I can arrange for you to meet with the girl.  The child of the guard whom you defiled in our sanctum.  Consider it a 'thank you'."
<br><br>
I should have known by then that our encounter in the confessional room did not go unnoticed.  Very little gets past him.
<br><br>
"I don't want her," I said.  It was a strange moment of clarity.  People who drink and then one day decide to stop often speak of these moments of revelation.  Of course I wasn't going to stop drinking, but the feeling of suddenly touched upon knowledge was there.
<br><br>
True, it was no real revelation.  There are always things we bury about ourselves.  My thought was there and exposed like a raw nerve without my normal flood of intoxicants to sterilize and numb me.
<br><br>
"Then what <em>do</em> you want?" Gainam asked.
 <br><br>
"It doesn't matter," I said, "what I want… She'll not have me." I said and walked off.  He knew what I wanted, and I suspect he had known for a very long time.
<br><br>
"But I'll see what I can do about the guild."
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
The necromancer's guild is an interesting place.  No real ceremony there.  In fact, the place reminded me somewhat of a factory.  It had the columns and arches of a temple, but when one looked around, there were none of the usual implements of ceremony, none of the colorful pageantry of religion covering the walls.  These guys were about business, and that business was reviving the dead.
<br><br>
The necromancers cared little about my presence.  In fact, not one of them addressed me during my walk through the place.  One made eye contact, but he let me pass.  In fact, for a moment I saw his eyes glance off toward a small alcove in an area analogous to a monk's cloister.  There I found a ring of keys.
<br><br>
Perhaps he thought I was here to kill T'daven.  After all, another corpse around here always comes in handy.
<br><br>
T'daven's room was the only one that was locked.  I let myself in and the place was cool and dark, much the opposite of his old room at his ancestral house, in which there was always a fire.  Seems the temperature mimicked the heart of the man himself.
<br><br>
I closed the door and sat down beside the bed.  He paid no attention.  I heard him stir every now and again.  Once I pressed my palm to his forehead to see that he had not fallen as cold as this room.  I wondered what unexpressive wonders lurked inside his blocked mind.  The man spoke little more than gibberish at our last encounter, as if without the ability to create his gloomy poetry his speaking and common sense were forever diminished and receding quickly.
<br><br>
I was there in the darkness, for some hours contemplating my words to him, when he spoke.
<br><br>
"Ezmend," he whispered.
<br><br>
He looked at me out of the corner of his eye, the rest of his face buried behind a graying sheet.  "Whuh…why are you here?"
<br><br>
I studied him a moment.  To bring him back to the FDM I would have to remind him of his hatred, remind him of his mission, tell him what had become of the group he had founded and forged to a single unyielding scythe's edge.  But for Gainam's insistence that the guild was the holy right arm of Innoruuk himself, I could think of no reason for him to rise and temper the guild's fury once again.
<br><br>
"I am here," I began and paused.  "I...  I am here… I am a part of you T'daven."
<br><br>
The idea of pretending to be a figment of his imagination was ludicrous, yet it struck me with so much irony that it seemed perfect to the situation.  A man who can not dream has friends pretend to be dreams for him.
<br><br>
He kept his face half hid and kept his one exposed eye fixed on me, studying, looking for signs of reality where there truly were many.  But in his disposed state he saw only fuzzy edges which his eye could not define and his head could not grasp.  He saw me and took me at my word.
<br><br>
"Which part?"
<br><br>
"I am the part of you that forgets."
<br><br>
He thought a moment and then uncovered his face.  The time alone had not been any better to him, with deep lines of worry criss-crossing his brow like the ruts between the hillsides of Nektulos.  He pulled his frown into a tight ball, his lips clenching like a fist to keep the questions within, as if there were something he wanted to ask but was afraid to know.
<br><br>
"What else would I be?" I said, believing my own statement.  "I'm the part that struggles to keep you from expressing yourself.  Why do your poems not come?  Why does the prose dry up?  Because of me.  You have something to ask me now, but still my influence keeps you from speaking.  Am I not right?  I am, I can see it on your face."
<br><br>
He looked nervous now, his hands clenched the blanket tightly and his knuckles were white with the effort of holding so hard.
<br><br>
"Do you have the courage?" I taunted. "Perhaps you'd like a drink to numb the thoughts that rumble in your head like the deep incoherent howls of wounded ogres."
<br><br>
I grabbed the cup and vase beside his bed and poured the water, pretending it were wine.
<br><br>
"Here," I offered the cup, "Take this and forget.  Isn't that simple?  We're two of a kind.  We're men of hearts dark as our flesh, we're men of steely looks but melting desires.  We know what we want but we do nothing.  Drink this because it will cripple you, but you won't mind.  Drink it because you'll never have to feel or love or hate again."
<br><br>
There was a glimmer.  Not the bonfire I'd hoped.  His eyes said something about his condition.  In them I saw the reflection of myself; A man who destroyed what he loved, no matter what it was.  He was the opposite side of the same coin; A man who loved what he destroyed.
<br><br>
He didn't take the cup.  But he didn't knock it away as I had hoped he would.  He did not refuse to fade away.  Instead he sat there nurturing a thought whose origin was not visible from his side of the mirror.
<br><br>
I sat a moment longer and when he said nothing, I stood and walked to the door.
<br><br>
"Mine dark it came…"
<br><br>
He whispered it softly, so softly I would not have made out the words had they not already been the words going through my head.
<br><br>
"…Like aging wine, like summer seas do scour soul skin and skull, and I am but the light she smothers, mother death, with velvet cloth…"
<br><br>
I stopped at the door and waited for him to lay back in the bed.  I wanted my image to disappear from his memory, not to simply walk out the door, else my phantasm be exposed for what it was; A man come to feed insanity, but who decided that he could not see his brother Tier'dal suffer worse than himself.
<br><br>
The verse was his; a poem called "Visitation".  It was a reflection he had had upon coming close to death once and how hard it was to breath in his condition.
<br><br>
The poem had been stored in my head a long time.  I found it hard to breathe every day.
<br><br>
The room was silent and he had fallen back into the mass of tangled blankets and was again one with it in the darkness, as if swallowed up by some woolen beast.
<br><br>
The dreams must have come at last.  <em>Why me</em>, I heard him ask in his entranced state, <em>Why am I your voice, my lord of suffering?</em>
<br><br>
And I knew the answer was simple, but that he would figure this out for himself.  He was Innoruuk's chosen because though we all feel pain, few can express it to a sufficient degree.  And when the words failed him, Innoruuk created a new torture for him.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
The girl saw me in the commons.  She wore a scarlet dress that made the guards look, but only if her father was not around.  It was an exquisite thing this creature of pent up sexual tension now unleashed upon the world at large.
<br><br>
She glanced at me as she passed, mostly because I didn't turn away like all the others.  I let my eyes touch her the way my hands did, starting at her bosom and working around and lower.  She stepped toward the counter where I stood, buying some rope from the only Tier'dal merchant in the area.  She took the end of the rope in her hand.
<br><br>
"Seems it's frayed," she told me and put it in her mouth, using her lips to press the strands back together and her tongue to moisten and hold the fibers together.
<br><br>
"Thank you," I said. "Do you know a lot about ropes?"
<br><br>
"No," she said, perhaps recognizing my voice, "but I'm willing to learn."
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
We left town later that evening.  No "goodbyes", no excuses for our departure.  Just a drunkard and the daughter of one of the town's less stable guards walking off into the dark, cool evening.
<br><br>
I have not seen T'daven since the night I spoke to him about his block.  But I have read some of his newer work.  One is called "Spirit" about a ghost who offers drinks to the damned.  Seems he's out and about again, though he'll have nothing to do with the guild.
<br><br>
Gainam still preaches.  On the odd weekend I can bring myself to travel to one of the faraway steads where he comes to give public lectures.  I can not bring myself to go inside, but I do listen at the window.  My hypocrisy can carry me there but not across the threshold.
<br><br>
And the guild, they still live.  They are survivors, whomever the strangers are who now skulk through the downstairs room of the blind fish.
<br><br>
And sweet T'danye.  I saw her only once since departing the guild.  She stood alongside some men with whom she had been out purging the lands of halfling runts.  Her hands were the most becoming shade of red.  And there will always be that thing inside me that I drown to keep from surfacing and announcing like a fool that I would be her willing victim even if it cost me Innoruuk's favor.
<br><br>
We live out in the world, the child of the guard and I.  I've since learned that her name is Snowvayn, not L'ania.  We are the terror and toast of taverns across Norrath.  Our first child is named Annarin… the ancient Tier'dal word for "Visitation".
