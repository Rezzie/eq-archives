The readers must forgive me but this article is going to be a combination of a few modes throughout it's length which will be completely IC statements from Oxes view, my inserting what's going on in her head, and an actual game log of a particular event.  Basically some dramatic in-games things have happened to my main character Oxesiess that will forever be a large mark on her life no matter how long she exists.  I thought it the perfect opportunity to write of not only role-playing in game, but also one of the few distinctions that I feel can happen between or to characters.

My eyes opened slowly to the sight of two women standing over me.  I was in a tent, lying on a cot. I was one among dozens lined up on our backs. I tried to sit up, but dizziness washed over me and I quickly fell back on to my cot.
<br><br>
"Your wounds are not serious, you'll be well in a day or two." said one of the women. Then they moved on to the next person wrapped in bandages and began casting their spells of healing.

They forced their way through the surprisingly thick forest with many grunts and complaints.  Because of the overly large number of paladins and priests in the group, Galm took it upon himself to curse enough for the whole group.  Either the rest of them appreciated his efforts, or they were working to hard a clambering through the underbrush to spare the energy to chastise him.  He decided that both were true.  Not even the sailors used foul language, their service to the priest Omonero seemed to include observations of the faith that Galm couldn't imagine a sailor adhering to.

As I sit in the library sifting through the various arcane tomes stored here, I cannot help but remember my childhood. Educated here in this musty temple of books in the center of the Isle of Odus, I often wondered what life was like outside the walls of the city. I would spend many long hours musing on meeting new people of all shapes and sizes, and adventuring around this world that my elders seemed to be so prejudiced against. Reflecting on how I was then has spawned in me the need to tell the world my views on life and recount all the things that I have encountered in my numerous travels. This will be my mark on society, however small.

I can't believe it, but once again I am being inexorably drawn into the popular complaint of the week.  Drawn in and drown as surely as if I had been a victim of the fabled Siren.  But then you folks don't really expect anything else from me, do you?  I certainly hope not…

I've been reading the boards again, and reading the posts by Abashi in response to players' questions.  First of all, I want to commend Verant for hiring Abashi and giving him the discretion to comment and respond to players concerns.  He is doing an excellent job, and I hope he is here with us for a long time.
