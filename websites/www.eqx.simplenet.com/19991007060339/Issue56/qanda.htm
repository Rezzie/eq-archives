<H1> Q & A </H1>
<HR>
<br>
<I><B>Q:</B>Is there a way to adjust the age of your character when it is created?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>There is no such thing as a character's age in EverQuest, nor have I heard of any discussion on the topic.

<BR><BR>
 
<I><B>Q:</B>Please shed some light on the name filter.  How picky is it?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Not picky enough.  It does a good job of restricting commonly vulgar names, and verifies that no one already has the name you are attempting to use.  However, it is too easy to fool.  989 has a policy to change offensive and K00lD00dly names, though, so we wont have to put up with them for very long.  There is an automatic name generator built into the character selection screen, so you can easily get a fantasy-sounding name.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>After mages cast a spell, do they need to memorize the spell again?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>No, mage spells will remain in memory until manually removed.  There is a short recovery time after each spell, however.  The mage cannot cast again until this time expires. The time varies depending on the spell, but is usually a couple seconds.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Can a non-PK rogue steal from any player or just PK players?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Non-PK rogues can only steal from monsters.  In order to steal from other PK players, the rogue will also need to have his PK switch turned on.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>How useful is being a rogue going to be?  If you can only steal from characters that are +PvP, then your life as an infamous thief is going to be short lived because there seem to be no +PvP characters.  How is this class going to be used in the game if you can't do any of its special abilities?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>A thief is a very limited rogue.  Rogues have a number of additional abilities, and stealing is only a minor one.  A rogue's true power lies in his ability to do exceptional amounts of damage with a backstab, and his ability to easily gain access to sealed areas with pick locks.  As a thief, you can either steal from monsters, or just carefully select your player targets.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>How many experience points will it take to gain a level?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Experience points are never shown in numerical format.  You see only a graphical representation as a colored bar split into fifths.  You can see how much of the bar is left to be filled, and once it is filled you will gain a level. The amount of experience required depends on the level, the race, and the class of the character.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>I have not seen any information on server locations.  Are all the current servers in the U.S.?  Will we be getting any European servers?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Currently EQ is in phase 3, with a total of around 4000 beta testers.  This is enough to put one server up to or over the target maximum usage (1500 people) at peak times.  Because of this, there is only one server, and it is located at 989 Studios.  Phase 4 will necessarily require additional servers, so we will have to wait and see how that is implemented.  We have no information about server availability in other countries.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Can you retrieve throwing weapons or arrows?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>No.  Once you throw or fire the ammo, it vanishes.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>I was the only one from our online guild to make the phase 3 beta.  Is it against the NDA to tell them stories from my character's point of view, without revealing game mechanics?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>I suggest you read the NDA before clicking that Accept button.  It is a violation of the NDA to even reveal that you are in the beta.  You cannot tell them anything.  However, if you want to write a story, you can submit it to a site like EverQuest Express who has permission to publish such things.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>In many of the screenshots I have seen, it appears that melee combatants stand quite far away from each other, and that the weapons do not even come close to touching the actual body of one's opponent.  Is this true?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Yes.  Range is a factor, as you have to be close enough to attack a monster.  However, it is quite lenient and does not require actual contact.  This is because when you are that close, all you can see is the monster's face (or knees, if you are a gnome).  It feels natural enough when you are in combat, so don't worry.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Why are hybrids such as paladins, shadowknights, and rangers harder to advance than a warrior?  Are there special incentives received later in the game for this set back in experience, such as a powerful unique weapon or spell?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>The experience penalty is indeed to compensate for advantages of the hybrid.  Hybrids have more abilities than the warrior, such as spells and unique skills, and this comes with a price.  There are plans to provide unique weapons to every class.  For example, you may have seen screenshots on everquest.com of a paladin-only flaming sword.  However, as always, things are being constantly tweaked and tuned to find the proper balance, so the exact penalties will likely change.


<BR><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>How much of an effect on gameplay do stats have?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Stats affect you in various ways.  Strength directly correlates to how much weight you can carry, which can limit how much loot you can take or what kind of armor you can effectively wear.  Agility directly modifies your armor class.  Charisma affects store prices.  The list goes on.  You will need to make choices of what type of character you wish to play when you allocate points to your stats.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Do bards start with a musical instrument?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>No.  A musical instrument is not a necessity for a bard, as every spell can be cast purely through singing.  However, since an instrument boosts the effects of a spell, it may be something a bard will strive for.
