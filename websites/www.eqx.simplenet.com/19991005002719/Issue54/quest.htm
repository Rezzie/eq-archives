<center><big><b>The Quest before Christmas</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">

It was a dark, snowy December night. The kind of night that is only good for one thing (well, maybe two things. But only if you have female companionship), vegetating on the computer. Brad McQuaid had just finished vegetating (no female companionship, I guess) and had logged out of EverQuest for the night when the telephone rang.
<br><br>
"Hello?"
<br><br>
"Brad? Hi. This is Dave. Remember me?" 
<br><br>
"Dave! Wow. I haven't heard from you since college. Are you still working for Blizzard?" 
<br><br>
"No. About 2 years ago I got hired at Microsoft."
<br><br>
"Oh man. I'm sorry to hear that, Dave."
<br><br>
"Yeah, it's too late for me, Brad. There's no escape from this place. But that's not why I called. I heard you're going to push back the EQ phase 4 beta till after Christmas."
<br><br>
"That's right. We thought we needed more time in phase 3."
<br><br>
"Brad, tens of thousands of people are looking forward to a shiny, gold disk in their stockings this year. It's Christmas, for God's sake."
<br><br>
"I know, Dave. I just feel that more time is needed."
<br><br>
"That's what I thought you'd say, Brad. That's why I planted 3 viruses in your computer. The first one is set to activate precisely at midnight. You might want to be there to watch. By the way, I thought you should know that if EQ isn't released on time, Microsoft is looking to buy all rights to the game. You'll be working right alongside me, buddy!" *click*
<br><br>
"Dave? Dave? Hello? Damn! He hung up. Microsoft? Good Lord, no!"
<br><br>
After four consecutive passes with Norton, McAfee, PC-Cillin, and IBM, Brad was certain that any virus that could have been in his computer had been eradicated. Just to be on the safe side, he backed up all his data on his Jaz and waited until midnight anyway. As the clock on the wall struck midnight, Brad stared at the computer screen, as if daring it to do something. Nothing. "Hmph." thought Brad. "Some virus that was." As he turned to walk away, a voice echoed through his computer speakers (Using A3D 2.0, no less. It sounded quite impressive). 
<br><br>
"Braaaad. Braaaad. Come closer to the Color Cam and speak into the microphone."
<br><br>
"What are you, virus? What do you intend to do to my hard drive? You should know that I have all my data backed up! Why, you're probably not a virus at all. You're nothing more than an errant bit of code! I slipped and typed a ";" when it should have been a ":". I don't fear you!"
<br><br>
"Braaad. I am the virus of games long deleted from your hard drive. I have come to show you your roots."
<br><br>
With that, the computer screen flashed everything from text screens of Zork and Wizardry to Wolfenstein 3D. Brad sat teary eyed, gazing intently at the screen recalling fond memories of games of his youth. Then the screen went blank.
<br><br>
"Virus, why do you show me these things? Is it simply to torture me?"
<br><br>
"Braaaad. My program was only to make you remember. That is now completed. Program terminating."
<br><br>
With that, Brad's Win98 desktop theme appeared once again. Brad shuddered as it made him think of working for Microsoft. After eight more virus scans, Brad was certain once again that any OTHER viruses were gone. Just then, the clock struck 1 o'clock. "Aw Jeez, Louise!" said Brad as a voice started to echo in his speakers again.
<br><br>
"Braaaad. Gaze into the monitor. Look at the world that is waiting."
<br><br>
Brad looked intently into the monitor as CU-SeeMe started of its own accord. As he looked, he saw that it was accessing the cameras of people who were listed in the EverQuest database. As he watched, he saw people with their heads in their hands softly moaning "nonononono", people shaking their monitors violently, and then he came to little Timmy's room. Tears filled Brad's eyes as he watched Timmy violently clicking his mouse button yelling "C'mon! Recall! I know I have enough reagents for it! Aw man! The Firewall bug! Oh well, two can play at that game!"
<br><br>
"Virus!" Brad yelled as he quickly turned off his monitor "Stop this! Show me no more! I do not wish to see this travesty! You have made your point." 
<br><br>
"Braaad." boomed the speakers (nice subwoofer) "You can turn off the monitor but the picture will always remain. Remember." Then there was silence. Brad slowly turned his monitor on and was greeted once again with his Win98 desktop. 
<br><br>
"Two down, one to go." thought brad as he waited for 2 o'clock (He gave up on virus scans). As 2 o'clock struck, his computer suddenly rebooted. As it booted up, Brad watched in horror as the familiar Win98 startup screen had been replaced with an AVI of Brad himself sitting in a cubicle at Microsoft headquarters punching code for WinQuest!
<br><br>
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!" screamed Brad as he clutched his monitor to his chest, tears streaming down his face. "It's not too late! It can't be too late!" 
<br><br>
With tears still in his eyes, Brad rushed to the telephone, violently punching a series of numbers. "Hello? Yeah, this is Brad. I know it's 2:30. Listen, wipe the Phase 3 characters and send out the phase 4 CDs tonight. You heard me. TONIGHT! Don't worry about the fees (Author's note: I just thought I'd throw that in there), just do it!" *click*
<br><br>
With that, Brad rushed to his window and threw it open. Thrusting his head outside, he shouted into the night "Merry Christmas to all! And to all a good quest!"
