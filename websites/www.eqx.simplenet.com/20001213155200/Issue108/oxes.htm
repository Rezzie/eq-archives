<em>Dear Oxesiess, 
<br><br>
(I apologise for the length of this missive..I am of elven descent and as you may know, we do not like to rush things...)
<br><br>
When first entering Norrath, I befriended a fellow high elf, a cleric, outside Felwithe.  For many months we hunted together, she being more worldly wise that I and able to save this Paladins life when he bit off more than he could chew, and I have to say those formative weeks were some of the most treasured times of my life.  We grew close, and I knew that one day I would propose to her - I decided to do so after reaching my 20th season.  She had travelled to Antonica before I reached my 20th season, and when Tunare saw fit to grant me it, I was heartbroken to find that she had met a barbarian warrior stomping around the Qeynos hills and they were married.  I know not if it was the horned helm, the facial tattoos or the vaugue cattle-scent that attracted her to him, but that is neither here nor there..
<br><br>
..anyway, from there I travelled to the Runnyeye Citadel alone and vented my frustration on the goblin inhabitants for a while.  Some weeks later I again met the lady and we again began to hunt together on a regular basis.
<br><br>
I recently admitted that there could be no other in my life save for her, and was dismayed to be told that had she not married the man she is now with - in a past life she was also married to him - she would have asked for my hand.
<br><br>
To cut an already overly long story short, she has recently voiced a desire to try an alternate plane of existance in Norrath, something called a nue servor?  I have meditated long on what this may be, alas I have drawn a blank.  I only fear that on her entry to this other-plane, I will never see my lady again.  If this were to happen, may Tunare forgive me, I do not think I could go on.  How should I go about convincing her to stay in this plane of existance, or would you advocate the old addage, "if you love something, let it go."?
<br><br>
I thank you in advance for your undoubtedly cryptic although honest advice.
<br><br>
Githnaur<br>

Dear Holy Pally,
<br><br>
Yer right dat was a long story.  I's not sure I's understand da plane thingy.  Ya's mean she wants ta go ta a place likes Karana and ya's dunt wanna go?  Ya know ya's shouldn't feel to bad bout her be'n wiff a bashy.  I's mean jist looky at our bashys!  Dey gots big strong arms, and da war paint dat strikes fear into beasties hearts, and da best lookin legs.  Dat's why dey can wear kilts and no one else does.
<br><br>
But I thinky ya's gots ta looky at why she done wanted to be wiff dis bashy.  Maybe she dunt like super long talky, maybe she likes lots o blood and guts flyin.  Maybe it's his war cry and going all bezerk on stuff and and swinging all over wiff pieces flyin dat she jist wasn't able ta resist him.  I's been to yer city.  It's awful purrty but ya's know what?  Everyone is so.... act'n important!  I's mean, there's no camp fires where ya's kick back wiff da rest o da tribe and tell stories on cold nights.  All da elfs are walkin round in da super-best-listen-to-Holy-Speak clothes everyday.  Ya's gots ta wipe yer feet before ya's can even walk on da floors...  da OUTSIDE floors. And yer scarit ta turn around or have fun wiff anyone cause ya's might break something.  I dunno how ya's stand it.  Never gettin ta wiggle, or zerk, or dash round.
<br><br>
I thinky maybe ya's should tell her ya's want ta be shown all da stuff she learned from this barb, dat ya's wanna know bout not havin ta wipe yer feet and stuff.  I dunt thinky it's to late, she jist needs something ta interest her like when she meeted da bashy barb who was so different from anything she done knew afore.

<br><br><b>
Okay ere's what ya's do.  Ya's gots ta be like a sneaky barb.  Firsted make sure ya's follow da shadow knight at a safe distance.  DEN!  When der's no one round ta haul ya's off ta jail....  Ya's blind da shadow knight, den ya's smite da shadow knight, den ya's take dat hammer and ya's go BASH BASH BASH KILL KILL KILL and ya's keep doin dat until shadow knight pieces are going ALL OVER!  I mean pieces on ya's, pieces on da ground, big pieces and witty bitty pieces..  and ya's dunt stop till ya's can't count em!  Jist keep dat shadow knight blinded and ya's will win da day!

<br><br>
Welpers, see it's like dis.  Da merchants dunt git out much.  I's mean iffen dey did, who'd we sell to and how'd dey make any coin?  So dey stay in da shops all da time.  Cause o dat, dey dunt know bout say...  ya's casting thorns on me and stuff like dat.  I dunt git ta go home much anymore.  But us lucky barbs dat's seen some o da world, well we thinky dat's it's a wonder o nature dat yer feet are almost as big as ours, yet ya's dunt come ta our knees and these huge feet can move so fast.  Ya's gots ta tell me though Bigs, is it TRUE dat male halflins COMB da top o der feet at night afore sleepy time?!

Does he git in yer elbow room when ya's usin da two handed pointy thingy o doom?"  DEN iffen all dat was okay dokay..  I'd start thinky bout da other stuff.
