I have to be honest.  I have not been very impressed with games in the last year.
<br><br>
Total Annihilation was a good indication of what was possible in the
future, but it fell prey to the age old problem of "rushing" (building 
dozens of cheap little units to swarm your enemy).  Myth was a welcome 
renovation of the realtime combat genre, but I had trouble with controlling everything at once.  Beyond that, everything with blockbuster potential fell into distaste due to cheaters or PKs.

Grontha ran in a stumbling shuffle through the darkening woods, heedless of the sharp needles and whipping branches flailing her skin like a cat-o-nine. Behind her the glow of the fire was fading in the distance and she could no longer hear the guttural screams of her parents and the household servants and guards. In her arms, the contents of the small bundle she carried struggled weakly and the muffled cries of her infant brother went unheard beneath her labored breathing...

<font size="-1">
As editor of EQX I have been remiss.  I have not raised enough fanfare for our newest staff members.  Two weeks ago Elaanilus Nazgul joined our staff.  I mentioned it in passing in my editorial.  But that was not enough.  I can't tell you how great it is to have Elaan on our staff.  But once you start seeing more of his work, you'll start to understand.  And last issue I completely forgot to mention that I finally convinced Archanalia to join us.  You've been seeing his art here on nearly every issue.  And he's been writing for us for a while.  It's great to finally have him officially on board.
<br><br>
So welcome to them both!

<font size="-1">
"Run!"  Those were the first words I heard as I entered the pass in the Steamfont Mountains.  Of course that shocked me after a rather peaceful journey from Felwithe.  My first reaction was to draw my two bastard swords from their sheathes, my second was to look for the person that the words came from.  Not twenty yards in front of me, near a huge cave mouth, I see a human dressed in robes come running out of the opening full steam right at me.

The last ogre hit the blood soaked ground hard, and he lay still next to the bodies of his companions. After a moment, the dazed creature feebly struggled to crawl forward, away from the carnage.
<br><br>
The knight drew back his sword to take another swipe at his prey, then hesitated. His eyes narrowed. He had grown tired of this game. He gestured with his hands forming a glowing ball of light the size of a small emerald. The glowing ball of lightning grew at amazing speed, and threatened to explode from the knights hands. The knight eyed the ogre trying in vain to disentangle himself from the pile of corpses. He yelled out arcane words of sorcery and released the glowing lightning.

Jeff awakens.  He's a bit tired having stayed up till 3am playing Unreal the night before.  He rolls out of bed and grabs a folded pair of slacks, which were neatly placed atop a shirt, a pair of socks, and a fresh pair of underwear.  Everything was meticulously laid out in preparation of a new day.   He finishes getting ready and heads into the kitchen.  He pulls up a chair and sits down at the table.  In the center of the table is a computer terminal.  He punches a few commands on the keyboard, as the screen comes to life.  Things begin to happen throughout the kitchen.  The coffeepot starts to brew, as the aroma of fresh coffee starts to fill the room.  He loads his IRC client and joins channel #Windows, #Linux, #MIRC, #IRCHELP, and #Geniuses.  He pours a cup of coffee and begins to watch the scroll in each channel, which he has no problem keeping up with.
