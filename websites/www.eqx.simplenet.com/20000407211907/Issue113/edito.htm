I used to play MUDs long before EverQuest came out and every once and a while, something that happens in EQ will remind me of a Mud that I played in.   EQ and MUDs are very similar in construct, with the exception that MUDs are purely text-based, whereas EQ is 3d and full of color, and it's scope is MUCH larger.  The most people I ever played with on a MUD was four hundred or so, whereas I can log in to any server at any moment of the day and almost always play with over 600 people on that server, and over 20,000 on all servers.
<br><br>
When I played a MUD, I would usually powerlevel myself until I was a high level, then wander all over the game, beating up on things and helping folks get items, doing corpse rescues and the like.  Admins would ask me to occasionally tell them what I thought of a new monster or area before it was released to the public, and I got some satisfaction from that.
<br><br>
One of the things that happened is that occasionally I would get bored, and do something out of character and kill what would be called a "named PC" to EQ players.  Shopkeepers, the town mayor - "monsters" that were in the game that were incredibly tough that most people wouldn't dream of attacking.  They wouldn't attack them for two main reasons: one was that they were so tough, of course, and the other that you just wouldn't think of attacking them - they were like the "furniture" of the MUD - monsters whose presence was not for combat or experience, but served other functions, like the Priest of Discord.
<br><br>
This week I learned that someone had killed Kazon Stormhammer, king of the dwarves in Kaladim.  I had been aware of people killing Vox or Nagfagen, even Innoruuk and Cazic Thule, but none of that struck me until someone killed Kazon.  To me, Kazon was like furniture - he was there perhaps for quests, but not someone to be killed.  I'm aware of attacks on the Priest of Discord, but for me somehow that was all right, since he represented what to me was evil. But Kazon really hit me, probably because he is a dwarf, my favorite race.  I was further taken aback when I started a dwarf on another server and talked to a high level druid who said, "I've killed many of your kind." Ouch.
<br><br>
It brought into sharp light that people are killing everything they can, especially if the risk/exp or loot ratio is good.  I knew this, really.  Maybe it was my experiences in MUDs that made me somewhat immune to it.  City guards of all races are favorite targets of higher level players, since they drop good loot and give good experience and can be fought fairly safely.  Ask any newbie outside Freeport who had run to the guards for help and found their corpses at the gate.
<br><br>
Many servers are now reaching a new stage in their evolution.  There are now quite a few players on the "original" servers who have reached level 50, who have tried the Planes, assaulted Nagfagen or Vox.  People are now looking at new challenges regardless of the import to the game itself.  Verant is trying address this with the addition of new zones like Paineel and Hole, and Kunark, but it's a no-win game. Boredom is boredom, and we will see this more and more often.  
<br><br>
I'm not sure what can be done about this, really.  Creating new zones is a very time-intensive process, and it won't address the quick fix, instant gratification needed by many players.   One can only hope that they move on to other games, or start new characters on other servers.
<br><br>
Until then, I'll just hope that they leave Kazon alone.
