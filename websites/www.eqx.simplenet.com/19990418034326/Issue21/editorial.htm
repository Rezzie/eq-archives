<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 21!</font></p>
<p align="justify">
For the last few days I have been mulling over a concept for a new character in  a
new campaign that I am about to get into.  I have been told that I must have a
complete character background written up.  I have been told that my character must
have family and friends.  I expect to write a page or so explaining how my
character grew up, who he fell in love with, where his parents are and his
relationship to them, his studies, his friends and his reason for adventuring.
<br><br>
I mentioned this to a friend, one that is planning on playing with us for the
first time.  He seemed a bit surprised.  I have been writing, or at least knowing,
this stuff about my characters for years.  And it may be my fault, along with
another of my friends, that our GM is now in the habit of expecting these
backgrounds from everyone in the group.  Sorry guys.  :)
<br><br>
But what’s interesting about this is that I know that our GM will be using this
information against us.  This game will take place in a dark world, where magic
is rare, clerics are rarer, and evil is the rule.  We will be hard pressed to
survive and our rewards will be little.  And once I hand the GM a list of my
family and friends I will also be consigning them to some sort of horrible
torture.  Some undead, some lycanthrope, some unpleasant beast will kill my
parents.  My lover will go mad, run away, and return in an attempt to kill me
for the torture she thinks I put her through.  Or things similar to this.
<br><br>
In a similar game in the same world my character, Horatio - a scam artist but
otherwise a nice guy, was forced to spend the evening with a woman that he did
not trust.  In doing so he was breaking his solemn vow to his fiancee, the only
person for whom he had ever tried to keep his promises.  In exchange the rest of
the party was allowed to leave (this woman terrified us).  When he awoke in the
morning, all seemed well.  But near the end of the campaign he realized what had
been done to him.  During the full moon he transformed.  I was given my new stats
as a werewolf and told that in my heart I felt the great need to destroy my best
friend.  So I cocked my head and put on my most evil grin.  I rushed him, eyes on
his heart.  But my friend was a mage, one that knew how to make flintlock pistols
(long story).  And he just happened to have packed some silver slugs.  He killed me
with two bullets to the head.
<br><br>
And thus died one of my best characters.
<br><br>
Now some of you may be asking, "What the hell kind of game is that?  You call
that fun?"
<br><br>
Yes, I do.  I’ve spent hours in a Vampire game creating ghouls and servants for
games, only to have them destroyed within the first two hours of play.  Sucks?
Maybe.  But it happened because that’s what should have happened.  It is VERY
important to me that the story, the game, be as complete as possible.  I want the
GM to turn my characters little sister into a vampire and have her start killing
all my companions.  Why?  Because that makes for a great game.  A game, just like
a good story, must have characters that you care about.  If some of the situations
make you feel…, well, if they make you feel anything at all then they are working.
I never got much out of "You head into the cave.  In the first cavern you see three
large beetles…"  And a battle ensues.  So what?  Where’s the drama?  Where’s the
emotional and intellectual challenge in killing slimes and Orcs all the time?
Some of the best games that I have ever been in went three or four sessions without
the need for a battle map or any lead figures at all.  I like that, even though I’m
the guy that has to haul all the lead to the games (and I have a lot of lead.)
<br><br>
My point?  Hell, I don’t know.  But I bet it’s in there, somewhere.
<br><br>
Now I’m off to create some tools for my GM…
