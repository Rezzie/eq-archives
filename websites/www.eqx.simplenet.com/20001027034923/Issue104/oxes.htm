<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
          I am a priestess to Innoruuk, and this being the case, I am often called upon by young Teir'Dal couples to run wedding ceremonies. Unfortunately, When i go into Freeport to look for good sacrifices, the humans just run away. I tell them how their fear-filled blood will not only bring glory to Innoruuk, but also unite young lovers. This only causes them to run away faster. As you can see, this is a huge problem. I have been forced to resort to Halflings or even Orcs for sacrifices, and many a young couple has canceled there wedding when they see that there will be no human blood spilt. I have tried clubbing Humans, but unconscious sacrifices don't scream or writhe, and that really puts a damper on the fun of the ceremony. Please help!  P.S. Where is Auntie  Moog? she may have been a bit smelly, but she was a good Troll, with good common sense about such wholesome stuff as violence and seduction. No offenses, but you barbarians smell worse than trolls. You aren't even good to eat.
<br><br>
Sincerely, Concerned Priestess

Dear some type o heal'n chicky,
<br><br>
Welpers, I thinky I's gonna spread yer letter round cause it provides some thingys dat I's can give others tips on.  Firsted, yer bashy plan o attack.  I's mean.... when I's a sew'n, you thinky I go "Hi ya's wussy lil polar bear.  I's about ta thwap da snot outta ya's.  Yer not a tryin to smack me right now cause ya's know yer gonna git deaded, but I's gonna kilt ya's in one hit wiff da Pointy thingy o Doom anyways.  Unless I's not payin too close attention and me swing dunt jist lob yer head off in one blow.  Den yer jist gonna have a big gapin side wound and gonna try ta run from me.  But dunt worry da Tribunal likes da peoples ta have skins ta be warm."  Not only does dat take lots of talky, but by da time I's done standin der explain'n it's prolly wandered off and I's jist a talkin ta meself.  Now case and da pointy fer nother thingy yer letter shows... what's in stock fer da Norrath peoples down dat Path o Hate.  Jist looky at ya's! Trolls are smellin GOOD to ya's!  I mean we's not talkin bout jist plain troll here, we's talkin bout an adult SKUNK sprayed.  Phaw!  I always knew ya's Sick Elves were well, sick.  Next I's gonna be hear'n from a Sick Elf dat he uses oger toe jam on Lion's Delight sandwhiches.

<em>Dear Oxesiess,

Howdy! I have a problem with a friend of mine. She told me in uncertain terms that she is not attracted to me, and that we would never be together, but she is still my friend. But my problem is that every day she asks me to do stuff that would be better done by someone closer to her than I, someone she was married to, or something. Every day I find myself either helping give her a bath or am told to wash her unmentionables. I am of limited mental capacity, and I can't understand what in the name of Marr is going on. Can you clear it up for me, because I'm too confused.

Ya know, dat is a real thunker.  Lemme thinky a sec.  Ho'k done thinky.  Welpers, maybe it be like dis.  Ya knows when, nah not like dat.  Lemme thinky some more.  Done thinky again.  Ya knows, when I was a barb-cub da skelly's in Qeynos Hills would still sometimes run up and try ta thwap me even though it dunt hurt.  Now why ya's thinky dat happens?  Cause they jist dumb and likes fight'n.  Now I's not a talky dat yer girly is dumb, but I's thinky she jist likes da attention and stuff.  Dat and who wants ta wash der own stuff?  I mean everyone knows dat ya's git da water on ya's only so many times den yer skin is gonna come off.  Dat's why der's a boat in Halas.  How many times ya's dun washed thingys now anyways?  Ya's noticed any itchy o da hands yet?  Or yer handys gettin all pink and stuff?  If so, I thinky ya's should see a Holy One Shaman as soon as possible.

Dear Igag,
<br><br>
Hi ya's doll!  Wonder'n where ya's went, ya knows I's not seen Halas so full wiff da booze in ages.  Figured ya's had gone a stumblin.  hehe, I was a tell'n da Flooter Tooter jist da other day bout ya's.  Ayeps!  I said ta da Flooter Tooter, Flooter Tooter I's says, ya know da Igag one day was so drinky on da beer dat ya's could hear him a burp'n from da barb village in east Karana when he was allll da way over at da gorge to da mino's.  Flooter Tooter tolded me I didn't HAVE ta tell him dis stuff, I told him I dunt mind we jist a runnin so I's can talky bout it.  Den I told him how I's a yelled at ya's dat dat ya's shouldn't be a burp'n like dat all over!  Ya's should put yer head under water and do it, cause it would prolly make neato bubbles.  Ya's been show'n dat trick ta da lil uns over der?  I think ya's should afore ya's come home.  Like I's told da FlooterTooter, ya's can make bigger bubbles under water dan he can!  But iffen ya's really wanna git back home from all ya's said, I thinky ya's need ta git on da boat again.  Dat's what I did wiff da Morgy ranger type.
<br><br>
Oh. Another. question. I. thinky. o. after. finish'n. talky.
<br><br>
Ya's played on da lifts yet?  Is neato!  When I's der wiff da Morgy, cause we's a thwap'n a sick elf round, I's told him I's git ta worky da lifted.  But he'd done already hitted da button.  I's wasn't to stinky happy bout that but ere's da neato thingy...  Ya's can go back down so ya's can hit it ta go back up!  So we did dat fer a bit.  Then some other's wanted ta go up.  Ayeps Oxes took everyone up and down fer a bit den Morgy tolded me maybe da others should learn how ta do it fer them self.  So I said okay dokay and we lefted.
