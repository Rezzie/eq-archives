Some races which have that sort of tradition would be the high and wood
elves, dwarves, humans, and erudites.  Gnomes, halflings and dark elves have
the necessary long culture or history, but the nature of those races may
preclude a bard class evolving.  Dark elves tend to be power seekers and
grabbers, and anything not directly related to the obtaining of future power
may be disdained.  Halflings and gnomes may be too flighty to do more than
write and perform songs, the gnomes are less so than halflings.  Trolls and
ogres don't have much in the way of culture.  Barbarians are very likely to
have bards, since although the culture may be pre-literate, the Celtic bards
relied on memory alone and did not write down any of their lore, yet were
highly developed as a class.

One nice thing about the Bard class description is that EverQuest did not
make their bards glorified thieves, as some RPG's have done.  Bards could be
roguish, but those who were not completely dedicated to their art were more
often warrior-types than they were thieves.  Bards will hopefully not get the
bad reputation that evolved from those RPG's.  My namesake, Oghma, the Celtic
God of Poetry and Eloquence was also the God of Strength and Wrestling.
(Which is why Forgotten Realms emphasized his "Binder" aspect).  It will
also be nice to be able to defend oneself without an instrument :).

In summary, it looks as if a bard is a warrior/mage type in everquest, with
more emphasise on song as a magical tool than on the skills of the warrior.
I hope that those who choose to play one feel the urge to play it to the
hilt, and add a rich lore to the history that Sony has been leaking to us,
bit by bit.  I wonder if I'll be able to dual-wield? :)
