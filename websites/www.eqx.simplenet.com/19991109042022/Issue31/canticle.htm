Fale stepped out of the alley, eyes shifting quickly to scan the street
for signs of activity. In this weather, he sincerely doubted that anyone
would be about, least of all someone who would be interested in his
activities. Caution, however, was something that Fale prided himself on.
Throughout Norrath, there was not another burglar alive who could lay
claim to the exploits that he had accomplished. The Gauntlet of the long
dead king of Neriak, the chalice of Bishop Alderick of Rodcet Nife, and
even a stone idol belonging to the Frogloks of the Innothule Swamp. All
had passed through his nimble hands, to new owners and locales. 
<br><br>
	Lowering his scarf below his chin, he spat into the gutter below the
sign of the Red Boar. All of it owed, in large part, to Patrician. Pride
refused to allow him to voice it, but inside, he knew it was true.
Without the aid, the expertise, of the Erudite Necromancer, Fale would
have long ago fallen to any one of a number of obstacles which he had
faced. In the Innothule Swamp, Patrician used his powers to convince the
Frogloks he was one of their primitive gods, saving both he and Cutter
from certain death. In the Lesser Faydark, his skills had extracted them
from an ambush set by Gnolls. And most recently, his skills had brought
their elven companion Erethin back from the brink of certain death.
<br><br>
	Fale's hand rested upon the handle of the door, pride holding him back.
Erethin had not been the same since that encounter in the Burning Wood.
More often than not, the elf was submerged chin deep in drink, speaking
only when matters turned to coin, eyes always staring off at something
just beyond the reach of his vision. Once, Erethin had spent most of his
free time carving small wooden icons of the gods, smiling as wood
shavings fell like rain to gather about his feet, a wry grin on his face
as the image of Erollisi Marr or Brell Serilis took shape. Fale glanced
down at his belt, where a small image of Bristlebane, Patron of Thieves,
hung from his belt. Since Patrician had brought him back, Erethin spent
all of his free time drinking. When he could be bothered to carve, the
only icons that came forth were those of Innoruk, Prince of Hate.
<br><br>
	"All I owe to you, that's one you owe to me…" he said, opening the
door.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br><p style="text-align: justify">
	"Ah! You see Hagan, I assured you that he would arrive, and as certain
as the Crossing, there he is". Patrician turned to regard Fale, frowning
ever so slightly as he motioned for the lithe young man to join them at
the table. Erethin looked up from his tankard, bleary eyed, thinking
that perhaps the bar wench had returned with another pitcher for him. On
seeing Fale's face, he managed a weary nod and a slight smile, then
returned to his close examination of the dregs at the bottom of his cup.
<br><br>
	Cutter slapped the young thief on the back, laughing as he did so.
<br><br>
	"Off wenching, eh? Good fer yas!"
<br><br>
	"Apologies all round, my friends…'tis far more damp outside than I had
been ready for. Ever a city of surprises". Fale suppressed the urge to
laugh. The only thing surprising about the weather in Freeport was that
it hadn't yet washed the entire city into the Ocean of Tears.
<br><br>
	Hagan was practically squirming in his seat, as much as his bulk would
allow him to, and was clearly uncomfortable with the amount of time the
entire meeting had already taken. He threw a few nervous glances about
the nearly empty tavern, then began to speak in a hushed, conspiratorial
tone.
<br><br>
	"As you are now all here, I can speak to you of the details… you have
all, I assume, heard of Balok?"
<br><br>
	Patrician nodded, as did Fale and Cutter, the dwarf grinning widely as
he did so. Balok had been a singularly unsuccessful pirate, remarkable
only in the fact that he had somehow managed to escape three failed
attacks on merchant vessels travelling from Qeynos to Erudin. His
ineptness had earned him the title 'Balok the Fleet', for the swiftness
of his strikes were matched only by his rapid retreats.
<br><br>
	"I see you are familiar with him indeed, him and all his... talents. I
only wish I had been so well informed a month ago when I hired the
scoundrel to retrieve a package from Erudin on my behalf. The fool had
almost arrived in Freeport when some grandstanding merchant ship trying
to prove itself a pirate hunter finished him off. Now he, and my
package, rest quietly beneath the waves."
<br><br>
	Hagan frowned as he wiped the sweat from his brow with his
handkerchief. Patrician nodded, folding his hands on the table.
<br><br>
	"It is safe to assume, then, that the contents of this particular
package are not something you want the authorities, such as they are in
this city, to obtain?"
<br><br>
Hagan nodded.
<br><br>
	"Simple enough then… although before we accept this particular
assignment, I believe we shall require something a little more
descriptive than,'A package'." Patrician smiled politely, trying
desperately not to break into a wide grin. All this subterfuge, all this
clandestine planning, over a simple retrieval. Balok's reputation as a
pirate was so poor that after his ship had been delivered into the ocean
waters, the Freeport authorities hadn't even bothered to mount a
recovery expedition.
<br><br>
	"You have to understand, Patrician, that were my association with Balok
to be discovered, I would be ruined…and that package is
critical… critical!".
<br><br>
	Hagan seemed panicked, and Patrician nodded in understanding. The fat
merchant would be ruined for a multitude of reasons. Other merchants
would refuse to deal with someone who dealt with pirates and their
stolen merchandise. The criminal element would refuse to deal with him
for having the poor judgement to hire someone as incompetent as Balok.
And customers…customers would simply laugh.
<br><br>
	 Patrician nodded to Fale, who was leaning back in his chair, taking in
the conversation with a practiced look of disinterest. The young thief
scratched at his chin with the tip of a stiletto, and shook his head. He
looked to Hagan.
<br><br>
	"Easy enough, so it would seem, too easy by half, says I. Why spend the
coin on us?" Fale said, waving his stiletto to encompass those sitting
at the table, "Surely you could find someone else in this ramshackle
little town with the means to recover what you need, at half what we'll
wring from your hide".
<br><br>
	Cutter snorted, nodding vigorously in agreement.
<br><br>
	"Suren be more n' what yer be tellin', fat boy."
<br><br>
	"I assure you all…"
<br><br>
	Patrician held up his hand, cutting the merchant off in mid sentence.
<br><br>
"We have a deal, Hagan… but if you are hiding something, you may find
the end price far higher than you expect".

As suddenly as they arrived, the rains departed, leaving Freeport
limned in deep shades of blue and the velvet of the night. Stars
twinkled above the soaked cobbles and glistening stonework of the city,
guiding mariners home in the hours before the sun rose. The gentle touch
of the Ocean of Tears promised a safe voyage into the harbor, the waves
barely breaking the reflection of the moon upon the waters surface.
<br><br>
Beneath those waters, oak timbers, soft and yielding after nearly a
month of submersion, began to give way under the incessant pounding of a
none too pleased pirate captain.
