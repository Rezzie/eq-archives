   <big><b>F</b></big>lying on the plane, destination Vancouver for a huge annual Cisco Networkers convention, I started to think about what else?  EverQuest of course.  But this is not just another one of those praise Verant, thank God for EverQuest articles.  I decided to voice MY opinion (those of you who know me know I have one) of the con's I have seen with the latest smash hit. 
<br><br>
Since the day it opened I have been playing.  This game has not only taken over my life, but my families. 
<br><br>
Well to start off I picked a Gnome rogue, who I have enjoyed playing somewhat, and remarkably made level 50 in just 37 days 3 hours (/play).  
<br><br>
"<em>Razor just somewhat?</em>"
<br><br>
Well a lot the features that motivated me about the game, and my reasoning behind picking the rogue class during the beta have been removed, crippled, or not yet implemented.  
<br><br>
<b><big>Rogues:</b></big>
<br><br>
I really loved rogues during the beta, and from what was promised regarding rogues, I had hoped would become an important, even cardinal part of every party that ventured out into Norrath's many dungeons. 
<br><br>
<b>Pickable doors and locks</b> (although promised) are not found anywhere.  Not a chest, a container, or vault to tempt or tease my skills as a master (I think) burglar.  
<br><br>
I pictured a high level rogue in a black cloak with a hood hung low, just open enough to expose his beady red eyes.  Yet I find rogues dressed more like (and compared to) a fighter.  Somehow I never thought of a rogue as a tank, which is more of a role they play now.  
<br><br>
<b>NOT a <em>shadow</em> to hide in</b>.  I can't seem to hide from anything in Norrath.  Even the low-level creatures that I had killed as a child can still see me while sneaking or hiding in the many dungeons I frequent.
<br><br>
I guess I imagined rogues to be black in nature, since the citizens of Freeport seem to often remind me of my trade and how worthless I am.   How do they really know I'm a rogue?  I sure don't look like one.
<br><br>
<b>Poison.</b>  In most muds I enjoyed online, I was able to poison my victim without his knowledge and wait for him to weaken before I attacked him.  This helped make up for the lack of offensive skills my rogue had.  After all, a rogues motto is to avoid conflict, and stay in the shadows.  Poisoning weapons for weapons masters was yet another skill I was looking forward to offering for a small fee of course.
<br><br>
<b>TRAPS?  <em>Well sorta.</em></b>   I have found several traps in my journey throughout Norrath, and I can both detect them and disable them with ease.  So what's the problem?  Yes though they are there they don't do any damage to anyone, again making my services useless.  
<br><br>
<b><big>Auctions:</b></big> (You know I had to talk about auctions)
<br><br>
  Though I picked a terrible class (as I have in the past), I like to run auctions (who wants to trust a rogue with his money?) <em>But its ok because I don't look like a rogue anyway</em>.  Those of you that play on Mithanial Marr know I have my Saturday and Sunday weekend auction.  We not only auction items there but play games, and even hold a lotto which I might mention has reached 3,000 pps in one drawing.  Many have told me they really enjoy the auctions and look forward to them every week and for that I thank you.  My family and I enjoy dong them.  
<br><br>
But I want to expand on them.  I want this to grow to more than just the selling of items and a lottery drawing.  I'd rather call it a bazaar, with stands/booths/tents set up for various PC (player characters) vendors to display their wares.  An auction podium from which an auctioneer can get up in front of the masses and conduct his bidding in single turn.  Instead what we have is the constant spam of text where adventures are using an auction for more of a chat channel.  
<br><br>
Another problem we have encountered at these  "Bazaars" is the fact that with so much inventory and cash flow its almost impossible to have them anyplace but the Freeport (or any city) Bank.  This bank becomes quite full; actually the whole zone becomes very hoarded at these events.  We have found that at least in North Freeport when the zone reaches near one hundred and seventy PC's it becomes almost impossible to move things in inventory, move around, or count money.  And trading becomes a dangerous thing.  I say this with experience having already dropped a bag with over 6,000 pps worth of wares on the ground!
<br><br>
This overcrowding not only creates problems for the participants but it's also a real nuisance for someone who just wants to use the bank.  
<br><br>
I'll tell you where I'd like to have my event.  How about the Arena?  All we require is access to the bank from somewhere near the auction block.  The zone is large enough; it wouldn't interfere with people trying to access the bank.  But wait (getting excited now) not only could we have trading going on but we can include gaming.  Yes I'm talking about <b>combat</b> for prize money. 
<br><br>
Well we wanted to do this but yet again that brings up another problem we have found with player vs player dueling.  <em>Faction</em> hit.  You see your faction gets worse when you kill another player of a particular race. 
<br><br>
So to sum it up; this is the best damn game I've ever played in my life.  I haven't even been to a computer store and actually bought another game. Good for Verant, bad for other gaming companies.  But there are defiantly things that need to be changed, bugs that need to be fixed, and its up to you the gamer to make sure Verant knows what we need to make our experience in Norrath even more pleasurable.
