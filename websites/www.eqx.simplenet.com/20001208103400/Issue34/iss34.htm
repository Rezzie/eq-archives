   "Did you clean your room?" a hideous nagging voice called from another room.
<br><br>
"Yup. Sure did." I replied, as I kicked the pile of clothes, laying on the floor, into the closet.  
<br><br>
"Razor pick up that room or I'll have your father deal with you." She screamed from four rooms away.

<center><big><b>A Look Inside Monks</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
Many role-playing games offer the choice to be a monk.  They are typically
great fighters with no equipment.  But historically, I had always pictured
monks as quiet holy men who spend much of their time meditating and the rest
of their time transcribing books with beautiful penmanship and artwork.
So, how did the monk come to be the elite martial artist of RPGs?

<b>Chapter 1 - Kyanar Tavern</b>
<br><br>
Dra'Ka pulled back the reigns on his horse and surveyed the landscape in front of him. The sky was a dim purple and the moon hung lazily in the air. Storm clouds drifted off to the west slowly. Sharp mountains shot up at the moon, their bent crags looking like some odd teeth. In front of him was a bleak forest, full of gnarled trunks and limp branches strung with leaves. The path was muddy but by the tracks in it he could tell he was near a town. The trail wove in and out of the foreboding forest, winding off into the shallow fog. He breathed in the air, which smelt of dead wood and water.

When I first launched my alter ego into the world of Britannia with the
initial release of Ultima Online, I fully expected to encounter an
immersive, richly detailed world where I could submerge myself in the
personae of a noble warrior seeking the way of the Avatar.

I awaken from my sleep. A strange sense of solitude fills me immediately as
I open my eyes and look straight up. I realize I'm still laying under the
branches of a medium-sized Yew tree. A slight bit disoriented, and very
stiff, I gather myself and look through my belongings. All is intact, but
something is noticeably strange. I notice the rumblings of the clouds above,
looking almost like rain. The coulds form a most foreboding pattern as
lightning traces the clouds. I try to recap my events.

  I remember when I began beta-testing UO. It seemed so wonderful, bountiful, - so alive. I remember quiet forests, the rare sight of gold, the stunning movement of a herd of deer. (yes, 4 moving together) While ghosted, I witnessed a wondrous event; a group of 3 panthers attacked and killed a deer<b>...</b>

It seems funny to me that the latest rage for EverQuest discussion is last names.  It made me chuckle the first time a saw so many people worried about not being able to use the last name that they have always used for their characters.  Then I laughed out loud when it continued to be an issue<b>...</b>
