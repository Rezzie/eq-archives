<b>Part Fifteen</b>


<br><br>
   Gwyn crouched in the shadows on a warehouse near Freeport's West Gate, watching the Militia gate patrol loll in the shade.  They barely looked up as travelers passed under the arches, heading in and out of the city.  The tide was for the most part human.  Twice, a half-elf man had come through, and both times, the guards had leapt to their feet with a speed that belied their laziness, hustled the man away from the crowd, and hauled him into the guard building.  The first man had had friends with him, who protested loudly at the treatment, and was released shortly after.  The other was not so lucky.  An hour after the guards had laid hands on him, he was thrown bodily out of the door.  He sprawled on the ground.  Guards at the gate laughed as he struggled to his feet.  From his vantage point, Gwyn could see the ruin that they had made of the man's face.  He wandered off, clutching at his still-bleeding nose.  His pack was gone, as was his belt pouch.  Gwyn's lips tightened.  Things had been bad enough in the city when he had served with the Militia, but this…
<br><br>
   There was no way through the gate without one or more of the guards seeing him.  He had been to the top of the wall, and the drop was much too far, and the patrols too regular to climb down a rope.  He had pitched his Qeynos uniform into a sewer on the way here, and wore a hastily bought brown coat and breeches.  His longsword, stamped with the Qeynos crest, he had tossed into the back of a blacksmith's forge.  Nothing marked him outwardly, other than the elven cast of his features.  He might as well have sauntered through in full uniform, for all the use his precautions were.  The other gates were the same, and all over the city, sketches of his face were posted, next to ones depicting Kinory.  Under each, bold printing proclaimed that a reward of 1,000 platinum was offered for their capture, dead or alive.  Neither of the sketches was particularly good, and he was almost unrecognizable.  He knew better than to trust that to keep him safe. Many of the Militia remembered him from his service, and there were also more than a few who had been on duty with him as he had guarded Lord Bayle.
<br><br>
   For a minute, bleak despair came over him, and he passed a hand over his eyes.  He had failed his duty.  Too blind to wonder why Bayle had been placed in rooms so easily penetrated, too blind to notice Somhan's odd reaction to the news of a failed assassination attempt, or the man's insistence that he would handle the investigation, or his anger and frustration when Bayle had pushed the issue.  He had failed his Lord, and now Bayle was dead.  He would never sign the trade treaty he had spent so long negotiating, the one he had been so proud of.   He had been sure that at last, the first tentative step toward trust and co-operation between the city-states of Antonica had been taken.  And now all his effort, all his work would fall apart.  Gone his dream of safe and patrolled passage through the Commonlands and Karanas.  Without Bayle to hold them together, Rivervale and Highpass would return to their insular mindsets.   Without Bayle, Freeport would stay as she had always been, rich, corrupt and uncaring of what happened beyond her borders.  Without Bayle, the wilds between the cities would stay as they were, and the Militia would go on treating them like a personal playground, with no one to check them.
<br><br>
   He'd been imprisoned by the Dervishes for months, tortured for fun, used as a slave, humiliated and humbled.  When they'd finally released him, half-mad, an emaciated wreck of the man he'd been, he'd wandered into the commonlands.   He was found by a group of isolated Druids, who'd cared for him.  When he'd gone back to Freeport, nearly a year had past.  His old captain was gone, stripped of his rank and dishonourably discharged.  Half the men he remembered were gone, and the ones left were the dregs of the Militia.  The new Commander had done all this, he was told.  He'd hired on as a guard with the next merchant train to Qeynos, and once there, offered his service to the Guard.  Bayle had won his loyalty.  He had sworn never again to serve a man he could not respect. 
<br><br>
   Gwyn shook his head roughly.  None of this was getting him out of the city.   He backed away from the gates carefully, not standing until he was sure that he would not be seen, and then dropped down into a deserted alleyway.  No one gave him a second look as he emerged into the street.  There had to be some other way out.   Bayle's widow deserved the truth about what had happened here.  
<br><br>
   "Gwyn of Qeynos?"  
<br><br>
   He started, whirled to face a human woman, looking at him with her head tilted to one side, a quizzical smile on her face.  His eyes flicked behind her, looking for Militia, and then he turned to run.  As he leaned away from her, her hands darted forward.  One took him by the arm, her grip punishingly strong.  The other flashed downward, disappearing from his view.  A stabbing pain in his side, followed by a spreading wave of icy cold, told him what had happened.   His knees buckled, and the woman bent over him as he sank to the filthy cobbles of the street.  
<br><br>
   "Compliments of Galern," she whispered in his ear, and then was gone.  Gwyn struggled to raise his head, to call for help.  People rushed over and he tried to lift a hand, to point after the woman, but the poison had reached his chest and was making it hard for him to breathe.  Darkness fell over his eyes.
<br><br>
   "Make way!  I'm a paladin!"  Dimly heard.  Hands lifted his coat, touched his side near the wound.  He could barely feel the contact.  Then white light blossomed behind his eyes.  A wave of heat rippled though him, driving away the freezing grip of the poison, and he came back to the world as though surfacing from water.  He gasped hugely, and as the air rushed into his lungs, his vision cleared.  A high elf knelt beside him, clad in shining mail, her blonde hair pulled severely back from her cool, fine-boned face. 
<br><br>
   "Are you alright now?" she asked.  He nodded, laying still, panting, enjoying the feel of being alive.  "You are a lucky man," she went on, wiping blood from her slender hands.  "If I had not been passing by, I fear that you would not have lived to tell of this.  Who attacked you, and why?"
<br><br>
   Gwyn looked up into her clear green eyes, and then cursed himself for a fool.  The paladins.  Of course.
<br><br>
   "If we may discuss this at the Temple of Marr, m'lady, I will be more than pleased to give you the entire tale," he said, and struggled to his feet.  She grasped him under the arm and lifted, easily supporting him.
<br><br>
   "You intrigue me, citizen," she said.  "I think perhaps that is best."  She eyed the crowd surrounding them, and then nodded briskly.  "Come."
