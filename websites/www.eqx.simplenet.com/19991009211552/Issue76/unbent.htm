Okay, okay, okay.  I could have simply named this article "Ramble Along with Archanalia".  Like many of my articles, this one has a split focus.  In the first part I would like to discuss article last issue.  The second part will be (hopefully) useful information about interaction between the sexes in games.
<br><br>
I'm not going to say I stepped over the line last issue.  Much as a bear must brave the stream and trawl for salmon, I too must be true to my nature.  I am an animal driven by sarcasm and a need to push things to their extreme.  I am a literary bungie jumper, tucking my keyboard under my arm and leaping for dear life with the sincere hope that the coily, springy cord whips me away from the ground in time.
<br><br>
Last issue I wrote the article my "<a href="../Issue75/bender.htm">Gender Bender</a>" and received many and varied responses.  Let me first say that it is unusual to get more than one reply to anything I do.  But realize that by nature, people are more vocal when they are rubbed the wrong way.
<br><br>
Case in point, I've done 31 Lil' Archy Comic strips to date.  That's almost 5 months worth.  The only time I got e-mail on it was the issue where I didn't do an Archy.  I got two "Where's Archy?" e-mails (The remembrance of which is the basis for this week's strip).  Oh, and I got an e-mail from Onnie regarding the color of Archy's hat in issue 72.  That info isn't relevant here, but I had to include it else she find me in-game and bashy me into oblivion for forgetting her.  Fortunately I do Lil' Archy less for the pat on the back than I do to alleviate that contemptuous part of my nature (sarcastic animal, remember?).
<br><br>
So the first letter I get off the bat is from a young lady who likens herself to the blonde wood elf in-game, and who is offended by my stereo-typing of all gamers as "ugly".  I go back and read my article and discover nothing there that I feel says that.  She also goes so far as to insult my appearance.  Fine.  I've been around the Internet enough to know how a flame war works, and I am just not interested in one.
<br><br>
The line which I think she found questionable was the one in which I said in reference to 976 numbers and the unlikely appearance of people on THOSE lines, "…isn't it far more likely that someone like that would be out with her boyfriend…".  Note that the comment was about 976 lines and that the parallel I was drawing wasn't that people on EQ are unlikely to be attractive, but that just as on 976 lines the person on the other end is not what you'll be expecting.
<br><br>
How the hell would I know how you look?  I'm not psychic.  Remember, the focus of my article was on how the person playing a female character could be male, and vice-versa, not the personal charisma stats of real life people.
<br><br>
Now, I got other letters.  And the weirdest thing is that the most "controversial" and non-politically correct part of the article got no mention (The use of "lesbians").  I expected that with the continued decay of society as we know it and the rampant paranoia regarding use of any term (positive or negative) that has to do with race, sex, size, age, or any other "ism" would instantly be set upon by the humorless tides of politically correct thugs wielding the poems of Sylvia Plath in one hand and the "I have a dream" speech in the other.
<br><br>
Having stomped the subject of "Last issue" into the ground, I thought I'd try and do something productive.  Please hold your gasps of amazement until the end of the article.  (You see, I purposely included the word "try" as a disclaimer, in case I miss the mark again).
<br><br>
<b>Roleplaying the Sexes (Part II)</b>
<br><br>
So you stroll into Qeynos hills and stand around that signpost / obelisk thingie, and you see a group of folks come strolling up to you.  One is Aknos, a fighter with whom you've adventured before.  The others are Alinia; A female wood elf (Best graphic in the game along with the female dark elf graphic), and Arestean, a male rogue (Or as they like to say in Forum.Evequest:  a Rouge).
<br><br>
It's unusual to see Aknos and Arestean without Purgot, their buddy.  So you inquire and discover that Purgot is not around at the moment.  In fact, you get a private message from Alinia telling you that Purgot has been set aside because his name didn't begin with an "A", and that Purgot's player made Alinia in order to rectify this anomaly.
<br><br>
So how do you treat these three?  Obviously Aknos and Arestean are familiar, and you treat them like you always would.  What about Alinia?  You know it's your male buddy who plays "Purgot".
<br><br>
Now I think we all know the obvious answer is to treat the female character like a female character.  But there are a lot of male players out there with inhibitions about such things.  How can you "flirt" with a female character when you know it's a guy playing the part?
<br><br>
Well, do you think the guy didn't expect as much?  When you sit down and decide to make a female character, you have to realize that you WILL be treated differently.  If you aren't, then what's the purpose?  So you *know* that the guy on the player on the other end of the conversation was expecting to have this character treated differently.  And that's how it should be.
<br><br>
Roleplaying is about immersion.  Why do something differently because you know the other player?  Either your character reacts a certain way to female characters, or he doesn't.
<br><br>
My favorite character, Ezmend, is a drunkard and subsequently a flirt.  He spends all his time in bars buying drinks for the ladies and getting blotto (much to the dismay of his guild mates who would like him to be out in the fields practicing his craft).  With Ezmend, I don't care who's playing a female character.  I'll hit on her.  It's part of his nature.
<br><br>
Talryk is a different story.  He's suspicious of nearly everyone.  He's a thief, and as such has seen that nearly everyone has ulterior motives.  He doesn't get close to anyone, and treats women the same as men… as potential adversaries.
<br><br>
Orwin, my current highest level character, prefers bashing skulls to soliciting female attention.  He's a political animal, actually, and would most likely sleep with a women (were it possible in EQ) if it would gain him prestige.
<br><br>
I'm not sure that I'm on topic anymore so much as I am simply giving descriptions of my characters.  So let's get back to the topic.
<br><br>
I remember the first time I played an RPG.  It was, or course, AD&D.  When you aren't a 'ham' there's this kind of awkwardness you feel the first time you have to speak as if you are your character.  I think this feeling is pretty much analogous to the first time you have to play a character completely unlike you.  All of this becomes the stuff that makes roleplaying the hobby we love so much.  You play and play, and eventually "My character will…" is replaced with "I will…".  Your natural tendency to play things safe falls aside as your character wantonly leaps into the fray.
<br><br>
Playing an opposite sex character may very well be "old hat" for some of you.  I know I've been playing characters of both sexes for over 15 years, as a GM and as a player.  I simply would like to propose that those who have not done so would simply consider that they've played dozens of dwarves, they've played hundreds of elves, and they've played thousands of humans.  If this is the case, then playing the female may very well be the only frontier left for you.
<br><br>
There ya have it.  I started this whole thing out as simple topic that had not been covered for the roleplaying issue, and now I've stretched it into two articles.  Rest assured, I've beaten this subject right to the brink of it's own demise; It's looking for the closest town guard and /SHOUTing for help as it runs from me.
<br><br>
Whatever you do in Norrath, have fun and Don't be yourself!
