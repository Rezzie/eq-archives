Ok, I'm not asking for any serious spoilers here or anything, but I would 
like some information on a topic that I have found to be previously untouched 
by people.  I was wondering about the noteriety (or whatever its called in EQ) 
system in EverQuest.  Just some basic details, like some titles, or causes to 
change reputation, and stuff like that.  That is, if there is a system like 
that implemented in the game yet.  Thanks in advance for responding!

Can you tell us some general info about the karma system they have?<BR>

About alignment issue, haven't seen much about how it works, how it affects 
a character, how a character affects his alignment.
<BR>
<P>For exemple, take a dark-elf. If he kills monsters to increase his experience, 
does he increase his alignment too, making him more good? Do a player have 
any way to know where his alignment stands? If a character does too many deeds 
that should be considered going against his alignments, will he suffer some 
sort of penalty? But then, maybe a player cannot change his alignment no 
matter what he does?

Even though I discussed this topic briefly in my
<A HREF="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue51/e33.htm">From E3 to Today</A>
article, there are apparently more questions on the subject.  This is likely
because the implementation is quite complex, and takes some explaining if
you haven't seen it yourself.

<p style="text-align: justify">Let's consider this fictional story of Burtom, a Human Shadowknight born in 
Qeynos.  Note the word fictional.  As a shadowknight, Burtom is instantly
hated by the Qeynos citizens.  Upon walking into the streets on his way out
of town, a commoner lashes out a feeble attack, calling for the guards to 
assist him.  The guards come to the citizen's aid, leaving Burtom a bloodied
corpse in the street.  Burtom did nothing to provoke anybody.  He was merely
passing through.  But, the innate hatred of his evil profession led to his
timely death.  With his death (or three or four), the Qeynos citizens feel 
more secure in their superiority over Burtom, and no longer view him as a 
threat.

<p style="text-align: justify">Eventually Burtom makes his way into the world.  He begins the slow and arduous
process of cleansing Qeynos Hills of gnolls, skeletons, and other evil beings.
All the while, he speaks to the townsfolk, learning their troubles and needs.
He strives to gather information and deliver their desired items.  Soon, the
town appreciates his efforts, treats him as a friend, and the guards protect
him as one of their own.  

<p style="text-align: justify">By the time Burtom requires training, he is regarded as a local hero.  He
descends into the darker regions, seeking out his guild master.  As he reaches
his destination, the shadowknight training officer shouts out, "Your actions
have earned my contempt.  Prepare to die!"  Poor Burtom can scarcely react 
before he finds himself again floating above his bloodied remains.  All of his
efforts, while appreciated by some, have hurt the desires and goals of his guild,
and they will make him pay the price until he can reverse the effects.

<p style="text-align: justify">
So, how does this really work?  First of all, there is no such thing as 
"alignment" in EverQuest.  This is not a bad thing, as most alignment 
systems we see on MUDs are unrealistic anyway.  For example, if an evil 
character kills evil monsters, he tends to become good aligned.  This 
isn't necessarily correct.  If an evil character genocides a race of 
evil gnorcs, using their souls to feed his desire for death and destruction, 
should he really become good?  I don't think so.

<p style="text-align: justify">
EverQuest handles this issue quite nicely with a faction system.  Every
NPC is a member of some faction.  The human guards of Freeport are
considered one faction.  The paladin guild NPCs are considered a faction.  
The orcs of Crushbone are considered a faction.  The skeletons that wander 
the countryside are considered a faction.

<p style="text-align: justify">
When you first create your character, you select a race, a class, and a
deity.  These things all factor into your starting relationships to each
faction.  For example, a necromancer is likely to begin as hated by the
guards of Qeynos.  When you kill a monster or complete a quest, it may 
change your standing with a particular faction.  If you kill a gnoll, 
your standing with that faction will decrease.  If you solve a quest 
for the rangers of Surefall Glade, your standing with their faction will increase.

<p style="text-align: justify">
Sound simple?  Not quite.  All of these factions are intertwined with
relationships to each other.  If they Qeynos guards are at war with the
gnolls, then killing gnolls will also increase your standing with the
guards.  If the gnolls are allied with some underground mercenary unit,
then killing gnolls will also decrease your standing with the mercenaries.
It is very likely that killing a monster or solving a quest will affect
your relationship with multiple factions.  As such, all of your actions
have a lasting permanent effect.  This also means that your Dark Elf can
spend enough time questing for the humans to eventually be accepted into
their cities.  Of course, you may not be allowed back in Neriak.  Mindless 
killing of everything you run across could have far reaching effects that 
you will never know.  As you enter a new zone, monsters you have never 
seen may be calling you an infamous villain and attacking you on sight.  

<p style="text-align: justify">
To find out what your standing is with a particular NPC, you can /consider 
it.  This not only reveals how your targets level compares to yours, it
reveals how your target reacts to you.  It may say that it regards you
indifferently, smiles upon you warmly, or scowls at you, ready to attack.

<p style="text-align: justify">
The faction system is basically a web of relationships, tracking friendships,
enemies, and alliances.  It makes for a very realistic and exciting 
experience, fitting in wonderfully with the role playing aspect of the game.
