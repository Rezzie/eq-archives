A game that has been in development for many years is finally about to see the light of day. Anticipation for the release of this game has kept people on edge for many months, but it seems now that all the patience of these expectant fans will finally be paid off with the release of ... LRETS ALAXIAN: EverQuest battles. 
<br><br>
