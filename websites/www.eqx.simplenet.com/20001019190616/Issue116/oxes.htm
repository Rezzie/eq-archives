<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
Hiyas! Long time no see. I hope you've been having lots of bashy fun in cazic with the lizzies as I have. I just love that "hissa-hissa" stuff. Anyways, I just wanted to ask ya this, maybe you know the answer. How do you know when you've found the right girl? I mean, I've been "lookin for love" for a long time, and though I've had a few affairs in my distant past, even then I never loved any of them. And since now that I'm a monk, most girls be thinkin that maybe I'm a fighter and not a lover. Which is disappointing to say the least.  Oh, and one other thing, do you know of any available chicks... err... I mean ladies? I'm especially looking for dark, seductive, and aggressive Teir'Dal fems, but at this point I'll take anything I can get.
<br><br>
Your friend,<br>
Amity Succor
<br><br>
P.S. I told my daughter Valestra I was sending you this letter and she walked off in a huff. Please tell her I mean well, thanks.

HI ya's Amity! 
<br><br>
Way long time no bashy! Hey ya's member dat time near da top o da temple? Oh I do. Stinky snot gettin beat outta me, and da Ranger thinky bout it's time ta git away. But noooooo!! We's gonna drops em I's say! I's member I was bleedin from EVERYWHERE! and Ya's to cause ya's had ta take some bashy fer me. Man da lizzies were all OVER us. Der was lizzies on me back, and lizzies in da front and lizzies on da Side. I was waiting fer one ta leaps on tops o me head! One last lizzie standin and I's so hurted I's can hardly dodge and da Ranger right on his last finger wiggle manages ta snare it. I's crawl'n backwards I's so hurted. Dunno how I was still on me feeties and it's crawl'n forward and I's can't git away I's move'n so slow. And DEN! Ya's did dat leap up and kicky da feeties out thingy dat I's can't do when I's jump and kick, which I's right stinky madded bout dat it dunt worky, and it stopped in place swings at me again and I's gots one last parry off afore back'n outta range. Ya's know, iffen it had barely strached me I's done would o died right der, in dat temple. Ayeps I's would o had Oxes blood all mingled wiff da lizzie blood on da floor and der would o been horns layin next ta da lizzie bodies. Deaded Oxes in dat stinky hot, rainy, and err hot place far far aways from da cold o home and none o da tribe would know dat Oxes was gone...
<br><br>
Dat was GREAT bashy!!! Let's do dat again!! 
<br><br>
Ah, what was da question again? Oh yeah... welpers I's been honest wiff ya's doll. I's never looked fer a right girly and dunno why I's would. And what's wrong wiff being a Fighter? I'S a FIGHTER! It's a right good life I tell ya's and ya's dunt gotta worry bout all dat mushy intrupt stuff during bashy. Likes ya's say ta me all sudden while beat'n da snott outta da lizzies, "Oxes I gotta go, Girly wants muffins from freeport", or "Oxes I gotta go, girly wants Ice Water from Halas delivered ta her in Lavastorm", or "Oxes I gotta go, girly wants the one flower dat's grownin in South Karana", or "Oxes I's gotta go, girly is sending me on da Quest to find a short barb". 
<br><br>
Phaw I say, PHAW! Everyone knows dat der is no short barbs! Iffen dey are's short, dey wouldn't be a BARB, dey would be human! See what's I mean? Really I thinky, ya's gotta ask yer self, Amity ya's gotta ask, Do I's REALLY wants ta go looky fer something dat dunt exist when I's could be bash'n? If ya's do, I dunno where ya's find girlys. Heck da Ranger jist seems ta run around wiff me and da elfy chicks show up outta dat wood work place, Kelethin. Lemme ask him and den I's write ya's back, maybe it's something ya's forage ta make em do dat.

<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
Hello again great warrior. I sent you this because my father has been going on and on about how he wants to find a lady, ect ect, and then he tells me he sent you a letter? Well, hopefully my letter will get to you first. Please tell him to cut it out, he's too old to be looking around for lady folk. Besides, he's a monk, he's supposed to be celebate. But personally, I think if he was to get himself a proper wife, I'd think you would be a better candidate. Why, if he ever got out of line, you could, what was that, oh yes, "bashy" him into submission. Keep him on the right track and all. But like I said, he should just give up on the idea. The only lady he should love is me anyways, cause I'm the best.
<br><br>
Hope you get this in time, I sent a druid friend of Amity's to get it to you faster, Lady Valestra Succor, Daughter of Innoruuk and Amity
<br><br>
P.S. Hope you've been having fun with your "bashy" in Cazic. I can't wait to go myself and hear this "hissa-hissa" stuff my father talks about.

<font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Dear Valestra, 
<br><br>
Sorry but I's read yer note and gwauffed so hard dat thinky me as a girly fer Amity dat I's broke me write'n desk.  SO am now write'n on me leg.  I dunno bout all dat old stuff or what celebate means. He's a right good bashy lemme tell ya's so he can't be DAT old. I do understand dat sometimes ya's gots ta show who's da Bashy around dis place, but he seems awful errr awful ahhh, oh what's da word.... Bull Mammoth likes about it. Yer note didn't git ere firsted but it's okay dokay anyways. I dun't know where a he-guy goes ta find a she-chicky outta da empty plains. I's mean why would I's ever ask da ranger to track somethin like dat? Tween ya's and me, sometimes I's jist dunt git those he-guys.</font>

Hi ya's Kroag, 
<br><br>
Ack! Ya's EAT da lil uns? EWwwwwww! How could ya's? Ya's know I's know halflin's dat's not washed der feeties fer MONTHS! Can ya's imagen what's under or between toes after dat time? And da foot hair caught between da teeth... yuck! Personal likes, I's put lil uns in me pack but nots ta EAT em. Nopers, I's like ta collect lil uns as friends and stuff. I's jist put em in der so dey dunt git hurt or stepped on during da bashy. 
<br><br>
Perhaps iffen ya's din tell em ya's were gonna EAT EM dey would stick round. It's neato have'n lil uns round and ya's can always eat da lizzie meat, ya's should tries it. Jist make sure ta carry extra food and water fer em. AND! dunt forget ta let em out o da pack every now and den. Once I's forgeted after a super long bashy and sleepy time dat da gnomie was still in der, had ta throw away all me goods ta sell and buy all new food.
