Actually what I have to say does not specifically concern EverQuest
Express, but concerns EverQuest Websites in general.
<br><br>
If I was in the Beta I personally would stop reading previews and
looking at screenshots. I HAVE stopped, in fact, anyway. I learned a few
lessons in UO - I was fascinated with it, hungered for information, and
spent time at work (where I couldn't play) cruising the net for info.
The sense of discovering things for myself, exploring COMPLETELY unknown
territory, coming up with clever solutions for things, which, while they
may not have been new to the world, were new and satisfying
accomplishments for me, were inevitably, permanently reduced by this
over time.
<br><br>
EQ Example involving screenshots:
<br><br>
Case 1: What the heck is THAT!?!?! Wow, what should we do?!?! (tense,
excited)
<br><br>
Case 2: Oh yeah, that's a Deathfist Pawn, saw it on EQVault, the best
way to kill it is by ______. That wasn't so tough, ummm, you wanna go
somewhere else? (satisfaction, early stages of boredom)
<br><br>
EQ Example involving locations:
<br><br>
Case 1: Where the heck ARE we? I figured we could get to Freeport this
way ... Wow - what is happening around here? This CAN'T be safe for us,
should we keep going?!?!
<br><br>
Case 2: No, stupid, EVERYONE knows you get to Freeport by taking the
________ at the _______ - sheesh. Just go to *www.link* it's all mapped.
(jaded and bored) Man, newbies are so dumb. I've gotta stop wasting time
talking to them.
<br><br>
I bet not one in ten of you would be able to follow the course I am
going to. I am done with reviews, done with screenshots, and I'm never
going to go anywhere near number tables or so-called "strategy guides".
This game is MINE to discover and explore, and I'm not going to let
short-sighted curiousity drain the excitement out of a game I'm looking
forward to immensely. I plan on playing EQ for a LONG time and I'll do
the exploring and problem-solving myself, thank you very much.
It's hard to resist the lure of satisfaction at doing the "best" thing,
of being one of the ones in the know, of making things easier for
yourself, of curiousity - but I think it is more than compensated for by
creating your own solutions, tension, novelty, discovery, , and wonder.

Greetings!
 <br><br>
Another creative and well-done issue!
<br><br>
 I have felt, since I heard and starting reading EQX, that the ideas found within are extremely important for the world of Everquest. This issue once again reinforces that thought. I feel that all that plan to enter Norrath should read <a href="../Issue50/major.htm">Elaan's article</a>. If only the majority of players would read it and *understand*, then Everquest will truly be the creative journey we all hope it will be.
 <br><br>
Thank you again,<br>
~Sauleth
<br><br>
P.S. I welcome all of the EQX staff to check out <a href="http://max.giga.com/NorrathRP/">Norrath Roleplay</a>. I hope to see all of you in a Norrath filled with serious players:)
<br><br>
<em>[Ed. -  We received several letters agreeing with Elaan's article.  It's
nice to know that there are some people out there the do *understand*.]
