    <p align="JUSTIFY">"Here Ye! I hereby proclaim to the two men who attacked me that they may join my army, or leave and not listen to the words they claim bother them so much! Cease opposition of my words if you do not join me. If you do not agree, then keep your mouths shut!"</font> </p>

    align="JUSTIFY">"Some helpful advice, Master Sphere. Please listen. What you have just asked us to do is to ignore your words if we don't like what you have said up until now. No matter how much I disagree with someone, I listen as well as I can. It is important to me to get a feel for the way the folks here think and feel. So I will continue to hear your words. I know, a big sigh of relief I am sure. But you need to know that you, in your current work on EQU, are now a public servant as well as a Lord. Maybe you should think about what you have said as if it were heard by someone at Castle McQuaid? I like what your Tower stands for, and I like what it could be. I respect Dach and if he has joined you, there must be a reason. Don't waste that good start by abusing those that come here, or anywhere. When others disagree with you, remain silent unless it is absolutely necessary. But always listen to what they say. If they are right, let them know and show some respect. If not, say nothing. We are now your public. And when the public is loud and obnoxious, the worst thing you can do is respond in kind. I will let that stand as my last bit of advice to the people at EQU Towers, you're on your own from here."</p></td>

    align="JUSTIFY">Sphere's response was short, and ended any doubt about him listening to reason: "I am not a public servant. I will not make those that oppose me happy to suit you. Thanks for the advice, I choose not to take it."</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">I left the commons hoping not to be seen, seeking Dach. When I found him, we spoke of what could have possibly caused Sphere to become so hateful. We talked and went our separate ways, he to the commons and I to my cottage to sleep like the dead. I could not help but wonder why Dach was going to the commons at such an hour in the rain and glanced seeing a large group including WarDragon gathering there. I ran home and bolted the door, then sought the wine in my closet to bring me peace.</font></p>
