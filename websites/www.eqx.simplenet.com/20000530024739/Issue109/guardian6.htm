They forced their way through the surprisingly thick forest with many grunts and complaints.  Because of the overly large number of paladins and priests in the group, Galm took it upon himself to curse enough for the whole group.  Either the rest of them appreciated his efforts, or they were working to hard a clambering through the underbrush to spare the energy to chastise him.  He decided that both were true.  Not even the sailors used foul language, their service to the priest Omonero seemed to include observations of the faith that Galm couldn't imagine a sailor adhering to.
<br><br>
Oddly it was the tough and dangerous paladins that were having the most trouble, especially the heavily armored and short legged Glind.  Galm had decided to wear only the leather padding from his chainmail.  It kept most of the pointy things in the forest away from his skin without making it too hard for him to raise his legs over most obstacles.  Glind, as usual, was steadfast about wearing his armor.  The poor guy fell over several times.  Galm made it his job to pick him up each time.  For Fealwin it was worse.  As the only Elven-blooded person in the group, excluding the wizard Roawed, it fell to her to lead.  Somehow the part of her that was Elven was supposed to be able to guide them through Tunare's heart unscathed.
<br><br>
She had chosen to go without her armor.  But due to the magical nature of her armor, she never wore any padding.  So she was leading the way, throwing her cloth clad body against the forest, ungracefully carving painful gashes into her own skin while easing the way for the rest.  While it was obvious that she was in pain and exhausted, there was no way that she would allow anyone to take her place.  The Erudite sailors tried several times to do what they felt was the gentlemanly thing and replace her at the lead.  But her determined scowl turned them back.
<br><br>
It was dark by the time they reached the other side of the forest.  Galm guessed that they had traversed only a few miles of thick woodlands over the entire day.  As they finally pierced the trees Galm was struck with a sudden need to laugh out loud.
<br><br>
"Some hardened adventurers!"  A few of them laughed.  The Erudites did not seem to think that anything was funny anymore.  Far away from their beloved ocean and worn out beyond their expectations, their faces seemed to be frozen in perpetual frowns.  Their frowns didn't even break when the rest of the group had their jaws on the ground at the sight they saw there at the edge of the woods, as darkness began to fall.
<br><br>
When the forest ended, it ended abruptly.  The ground turned to hard, dried, dead, cracked mud.  The land was flat, and it spread out to the horizon.  Featureless desert as far as they could see.  The endless, unmarked void made the darkness terrifying.  Their camp was as close to the forest as they could make it.  The light from their fire made the void seem bigger, and the complete lack of sound from any direction gave Galm nightmares about Tunare striking him deaf and blind because of his improper display of emotions for another man's wife.  When the bard woke him for his watch, Galm, usually very grumpy about having to take a middle watch, was glad to be awake.

Galm had watch with Foram, the Erudite priest.  It fell to the priest to keep the fire burning, while Galm sat off away in the darkness.  The Erudite couldn't see a thing in the cold darkness.  And if Galm sat within the light of the fire the change of luminance kept him from seeing beyond the reach of the firelight as well.  But sitting on a cold rock at the edge of the woods beyond the firelight he could see a great distance.  Even so, he couldn't see a damn thing.  Hautin had told them that this was most likely the Field of Bones.  A place populated by the remains of thousands of dead, their bones supposedly so thick in some places that you could walk for miles on them and never touch the cracked earth beneath.  Galm wasn't expecting to see anything living out there.  And so he wasn't as vigilant as he should have been.  He spent most of his time remembering his terrible dreams.
<br><br>
Foram managed to get within fifteen feet of the Dwarf before Galm noticed him.  Even then he didn't react with the appropriate violence.  He simply looked over in the direction of the footsteps.  If Foram had been an enemy, even a feeble one, Galm would have been dead.  Galm knew that, and at that moment he couldn't muster himself to be upset about his lack of attentiveness.
<br><br>
"I brought you some warm ale."  These were the first words that the priest had spoken directly to him.  The tall, dark Erudite had a friendly voice.  He spoke flawless common, with no hint of accent.  Galm sensed no arrogance at all in the voice, nor in the way that Foram folded himself quietly to the ground.  He sat comfortably on the hard ground, legs crossed in front of him, his torn robes of office folded about his legs for warmth.  Out here in the darkness the Erudite had to be nearly blind.  Galm thought he knew something of the helplessness of such a circumstance.  His dreams were still in the forefront of his mind.
<br><br>
"Thanks, lad."  He turned to face the Erudite, finding that while seated on his rock his eyes were on level with the other man as he sat on the ground.  "Where in this forsaken land did you find this?"
<br><br>
"Do you think we had ten sailors hauling only holy raiment and scripture on waxed scrolls?"
<br><br>
Galm couldn't help but smile.  "May ya be blessed by Brell, despite yer soggy nature."  He took a deep drink of the warm spiced ale.  He groaned audibly with satisfaction.
<br><br>
Foram chuckled.  "You know, Omonero wanted to throw you off the ship as soon as you forced your way on.  I bet now you wish that he had done so."
<br><br>
"Nah.  I like it here.  It's like a vacation.  I haven't had ta kill anythin in weeks.  Tell me...  why did Prexus allow us through?  I know you and Omonero are his high priests an all that.  But why break his own rules?"
<br><br>
"To know that, I would have to be The Ocean Lord.  The motivations of Prexus are beyond even my understanding.  But I suspect that we are needed here more than even your brother and the others know.  It is common for Tunare to ask her followers to aid people.  It is not so with Prexus.  And for The Ocean Lord to allow...  what is it?"
<br><br>
Galm was on his feet with his axe gripped tightly in both of his hands.
<br><br>
"Go and wake the others.  But do it quietly.  If they don't know that we're aware of them, it might give us an advantage."
<br><br>
As the Erudite walked slowly back to camp, he had to marvel at his composure.  He couldn't possibly see the figures beginning to circle them.  But there he had to sense them.  Even knowing where they were, Galm was getting a bit shaky, eager for the battle.  How Foram remained so calm...
<br><br>
Galm sat back down.  He knew that the intruders were aware of him.  He wanted them to think that he was unaware of them.  What were they?  With his ability to see body heat, he knew one thing for sure about them.  They were not warm blooded...
