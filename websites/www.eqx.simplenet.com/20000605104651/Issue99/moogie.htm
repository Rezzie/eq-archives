[Ed. - We found this on Moogie's desk after she left.  While we seem to be having a fair amount of trouble 
removing that nasty Dark Elf from the premises, I am going to make certain that you all get to read Moog's last column...  she will be missed.]

<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
For some reason, I have an overwhelming attraction to High Elf women, whilst I am a human. Other humans think I'm totally nuts, and while I am nuts, they think it's wrong for me to be attracted to a race other than mine. Auntie Moog, you're the smartest person I respect, please tell me what I can do about this, or should I just slice and dice all the nay-sayers with my minotaur axe?

Dear Estocles,
<br><br>

<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
I am an Erudite wizard and feel that I would like to see more of the world of Norrath. I was wondering what I could do to safely travel the roads of the fair city of Grobb to impart my vastly superior intelect upon the inhabitants and to gain a better understanding of troll culture without being "barshed?"

Moog would answer, but Moog has to go stir Erudite stew now…

<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>

Dear Embarassed
<br><br>
Moog know your problem.  Here what Moog do.  If look reelly close, you can see dat Inkies are shaped like Trolls and Ogres, just in small size.  It hard, when used to seeing Troll and Ogre wimmins with great big…assets, to see same on Inkies, but dey are dere.  Just don't get too close, or could make Inkies mad.  Dat never a good ting.
</b><br><br><br>

Moog want to say someting.  Aklar be goin way and she ask Moog to go wit her cause she be lonely.  Moog was getting tired of dis tiny desk and always writing all de time anyways, so I going.   If you have more problems, and don't know answer, just ask yorself.  What Moog do?  And if you don't know what Moog do, I tell you.  Moog bash.  Solve most problems. 
 <br><br>
For instance, Moog can't fit through dis doorway, and Aklar is waiting outside.  Moog bash…and dere.  Problem solved.
<br><br>
Bye for now.  If see Moog in Norrath, come and say hi.  Moog like to talk…when Moog not hungry.
