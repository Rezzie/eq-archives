Recently something exciting has happened on my server Karana.  In fact I wish I had thought of it.  A person from the server called a meeting of guild leaders to discuss the atmosphere of the server.  
<br><br>
That about sums up the general intent.  Basically the guild leaders who attended, or those like myself who had to go chase down a tart blond greyhound who got out of the fence and had someone log it to read it later, got together with no other interest but to bring more entertainment to the server.  The whole purpose of the meeting was guild leaders, officers, or a proxy from the guild putting their heads together to discuss events, role-playing, alliances and even wars.  They were there to talk about anything and everything except killing the soothsayer gnoll who showed up.
<br><br>
Players continually say, in the forums or in emails posted to the news sites, that there's nothing else to do but to kill MOBs and camp.  Personally I think the whole reason this is a problem is because no one really wants to stand up and do the "Leg Work".  It IS a lot of work.  I do not know how many of you out there have run a guild, but let me share my experiences from being in at least seven guilds long term, helping to run three, and being the leader of my current one.
<br><br>
It is WORK.  My guild isn't big by any stretch, at least not compared to some.  We don't really actively seek out anyone who hails us since the concept behind it is rather different from most guilds.  Also the guild is made up of good friends.  Even if you are new, I think I am very safe in saying by the end of the week you feel like you know the members and enjoy their company.  If the guild didn't exist we would still treat each other like we do now.  But for me it is still WORK.
<br><br>
I spend my days reading emails from my guild members, looking up news, trying to make sure everything is going smooth, posting on various boards as well as our, writing out plots, rumors, thinking of persona interaction, checking to see someone has access to the boards, and answering questions if they if they don't, etc.  That's just out of the game.  In the game there seems to be so much more to be done.
<br><br>
I log Oxesiess and somehow, in her silly barb way, she seems to hold them all together.  If I am not fishing for an upcoming event I'm chasing down some monster to help a friend, hooking people up together, giving news of current going-ons, answering questions regarding where the guild is going, answering questions on how we are going to help someone who's died, where we are going to hunt, where they are going to hunt, what's happened when some people ran into so and so, and just about anything you can think of.  This is not including talking to other guild leaders or people in their guilds that mine interacts with, nor my own friends that Oxesiess grew up with and are in other guilds.  Sometimes I feel like Oxesiess is a main switchboard and I have not even logged her for myself yet to play the Bashy-barb.
<br><br>
But I <u>enjoy</u> it.  I enjoy knowing what I do has others enjoying their gaming time more, that by the extra effort I go to seeing things are running smoothly OOC makes sure they have more IC time to themselves.  I also enjoy that I to get to reap the benefits of my own work.  To create such an atmosphere though, and I really hope my guild does not read this article, it takes a lot of behind the scenes work.
<br><br>
The people who attended this meeting were such people as I.  They were all there because they cared and sound like they will do the WORK.  The meeting took place at 8:00 at night.  I mention this because a guild leader from a French guild attended.  Speaking English far better than I could try French eight years later after first studying it, he brought up concerns with members who don't speak English but wanting to help and have the members participate.  This just floored me while reading the log.  In case readers aren't aware, 8:00 Central Standard Time is <b>very</b> late night/morning there.  But this person made the effort to attend for their guild and wanting to improve the environment on Karana.
<br><br>
Someone else brought up in the meeting that their guild would not role-play.  The guild would not say Thee's and Thou's which were required.  Oh how I wish I had been there, Oxesiess lingo-ing along not one Thee, Thou, or Halieth and Suppeth good Sir!  Well for the meeting I would have toned it down, but I can't believe the misconceptions about role-playing that still exist, that to role-play one must use the propaganda.  Even the NPC role-played along with the meeting without a single thee or thou!

[Thu Feb 17 22:13:44 2000] a Highpass citizen says 'Guilds in Highpass!!? I am afraid not. If you wish to join the ranks of the Highpass Watch. Speak with one of our officers.<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:14:06 2000] Aella chuckles.<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:14:09 2000] Deodrid laughs<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:14:23 2000] Rasemlo laughs.
<br><br>
The most important thing in this meeting that was discussed and really caught my eye was the following:
<br><br>
Thu Feb 17 22:41:23 2000] Nikolos says, 'Also, a couple general guidelines for this council that I believe would make things run smoothly .<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:41:44 2000] Nikolos says, 'First, this council should consist of 1 person from each guild'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:42:06 2000] Rasemlo says, 'And that would be the leader right'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:42:22 2000] Binadar agrees with Nikolos.<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:42:27 2000] Nikolos says, 'The guilds themselves can decide who from their guild will represent them, and it will be this persons responsibility to inform their guild on anything they feel they need to'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:42:34 2000] Haemish says, 'Not necessarily Rasemlo . up to the individual guild who they want.'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:42:49 2000] Rasemlo says, 'Oh . O K.<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:42:55 2000] Nikolos says, 'It can be the guild leader, or an officer of that guild, or one of the members. It's up to the individual guilds who to choose'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:43:09 2000] Nikolos says, 'Point is, only 1 person representing their entire guild'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:43:42 2000] Nikolos says, 'Second, use the Silver Order message boards to announce ourselves, and invite the leaders of other guilds to join us'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:44:08 2000] Belce says, 'Aye'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:44:26 2000] Nikolos says, '3rd, allow ALL guilds to join. Dont stipulate only good guilds, or guilds that dont condone KSing or some such limitiations. Afterall'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:44:39 2000] Haemish says, 'AYE! ALL GUILDS!'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:44:44 2000] Nikolos says, 'No matter what you or I may think of another guild, they have a right to exist as we do '<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:44:53 2000] Maela nods in complete agreement.<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:44:56 2000] Tarhg says, 'AYE'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:45:04 2000] Rasemlo says, 'Here, here!'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:45:08 2000] Binadar nods in agreement.<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:45:20 2000] Nikolos says, 'If you and your guild are at war, or not on good terms with someone else . then dont work with them. But dont disclude them either'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:45:32 2000] Rasemlo says, 'Here, here!'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:45:33 2000] Nikolos says, 'As they may be your enemy, at the same time, they may be my friend'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:45:51 2000] Rasemlo says, 'Well said.'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:45:59 2000] Maela smiles and applauds Nikolos.<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:46:15 2000] Bangoo rethinks of the 'keep your enemies even closer than your friends' quote.<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:46:39 2000] Nikolos says, 'And also, tonight should be used to just get us on the same track, we cant try to organize an entire server event in one night, but as a council, working together for a little while through a message board'<br>
[Thu Feb 17 22:46:51 2000] Nikolos says, 'We could probably accomplish more than you can immagine .'
<br><br>
Regardless if your guild is seen as a bunch of jerks to other players or not, these people want to work with you, OOC, on their own time, followed by communicating with all of you in their Leg Work, just to make the server more than it is now.
<br><br>
There was an...  "incident" recently between my own guild and another, the evils, we were at war with.  I won't go into particulars, however I will say that during an attack by a member of mine who role-plays a drunk barb things got very OOC and out of hand.  A teleporting druid in my guild teleported me to the nearest spot as I ran to diffuse it before it all went to total OOC heck.  Despite these other non-guilded players being aware of the guild war and other notable things regarding the situation that they informed me in /tells, they didn't care.  They ran up when I had finally focused their attention on myself instead of my guild people, and started telling me how much they hate my guild.  
<br><br>
Of course a couple of things were running through my mind at this point.  Personally, I was <b>very</b> happy down in the depths of the dungeon before this all happened.  I really didn't want to leave, I was in the middle of getting a flowered pattern of guts on the wall with Oxesiess during her bashy and was quiet happy doing it.  Not to mention I had a bet going on in the zone about agreeing that another member of our party had a plate hat on his wood-elf that makes him look like he's wearing a big pink bow.  I was having one of those moments when I got to let loose, and just be Oxesiess Bashy.  She was talking to the world around her and it was laughing at her.  I was having a fabulous evening.
<br><br>
However, I stood up and said I would do a job when I volunteered to be a guild leader.  Therefore I left all that great bashy to go off and do my leaderish work.  I find out when I got to the scene that anything I could possibly say smoothing the situation over or its history didn't matter one wit to the others grouped with the "evil".  They flat weren't interested.  Going through my mind of course was the impact on anyone else who might be displaying a &lt;Guild_Tag&gt; with our name.  I could see this situation effecting the people in my guild despite this "incident" being the only one of its kind that had ever happened.  This occurrence is rather recent which is why I perked up at what was said in the log.  That night there was really no chance of redemption for either side in the situation.   I was also informed in a /tell from someone grouped but not in the evil guild that my guild member had interrupted some EXP gain.  Regardless if that's the truth of it nor not, tempers were so high I doubt the story told being recounted later to do anyone justice, let alone anyone who happened to walking up during insults and accusations being thrown.  Do you really think anyone who might hear of what occurred will hear all of both sides on a nice even playing field?  Not at all.  You would probably hear wild tales of anything under the sun.  Only through time and association do you begin to learn what people are truly made of.  Not chance encounters, forgive me a chuckle, in the night. &lt;laughs&gt;
<br><br>
Players often sit back, say what's wrong with the game and keep saying it.  In fact mostly that's all I see them doing.  Just saying it.  These people who were at the meeting want to do, not just talk.  They speak and strive for action.  Again I sit and wonder why I did not think of it.  From this meeting even if only a partial understanding of each other comes making the server that much more player interactive, then it has been a success.  Even if only some events that players enjoy for the next few moths happen, then it has been worth the time.  Even if only the guild leaders met to get to know each other and then switchboard it off to their guilds, something has been accomplished.
<br><br>
Entertainment and an atmosphere/interaction that's enjoyable on a large scale does not just happen.  You cannot sit back and just expect a_someone_01 out there to entertain you.  It takes actors, a director, the scriptwriter, costume designer, make-up artist, stunt doubles, film, projectors, evil editors, and key grips.  Before all of those people even get to walk on the set, a company has to decide they will take the project.  Verant has given us the project, now there has to be some Leg Work.  I hope from the meeting there will be more of us cohesively working to help you to be as entertained as we ourselves want to be.  Well that and I hope we can soon figure out who will be key grips...
