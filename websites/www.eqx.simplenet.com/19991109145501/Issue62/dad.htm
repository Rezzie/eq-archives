I had my family over the other night for a day of visitation and dinner.  After a great meal, prepared by my wife, I took my dad down to the computer room to show him some of the networking projects I had been working on for the last two years.  After about five minutes of looking at network topology drawings, I was sure I was loosing his attention so I fired up a few games to show him where the technology was going.  I myself have always been excited about how far the gaming industry has taken us.  
<br><br>
Now my father isn't one I would consider old, but he has been around long before the days of the computer, and I'll just leave it at that.  
<br><br>
My father has never been that fond of games on the computer.  Hell, he has never been that fond of computers period until a few years ago he decided his accounting firm had to have them to stay in business.  I'm quite sure if the industry hadn't forced him, he would still be doing books by hand.
<br><br>
<em>I still can't get him on the Internet because he thinks people will want to get into his computer</em>.
<br><br>
Anyway I load up a few of the latest titles.  He showed little interest, at least nothing to jump up and down about.  I was about to shut the computer down and give up trying to impress my father when <em>HE</em> saw the jewel case for EverQuest™.  <em>Probably because the CD face had a half naked female bending over</em>, and said, "What is that program?" 
<br><br>
"Oh I've been beta testing for an online RPG game since last year." I reply.
<br><br>
"RPG? Is that that dragon dungeon crap you played when you were a kid?"
<br><br>
<em>[Gotta love my dad]</em>
<br><br>
"Well it's not crap, but yes, its much like D&D®." I scuffed.
<br><br>
I loaded up the game.  Walking around several of the zones I showed him some of the great 3d effects for spells, creature animation, and general landscaping in the game.  
<br><br>
He was fascinated.  
<br><br>
"Hey she's cute!" Dad said pointing at a small Wood Elf dressed in a very petite green one piece-bathing suite.  "Hey all the women are cute." He added soon after.
<br><br>
I laughed.  "Let me show you a female Troll"
<br><br>
He was totally impressed with the game design.  This coming from a man who hates computers, and has no zero interest in role-playing.  
<br><br>
I must have spent an hour showing him the rest of the game, and answering his questions.  If anything I was happy he showed the interest in looking at something I really enjoyed.  We bonded.  
<br><br>
Taking a look at the game now, multiple servers have arrived, guilds have been added, in game quests are popping up everywhere, and recently trading has been added.  The game called EverQuest nears its final tests before being released to the millions of game fans who have been patiently waiting since early last year.  
<br><br>
This is a game that even non-gamers are going to enjoy.  If my father can take an interest in this game anyone can!   
<br><br>
Yours,<br>
