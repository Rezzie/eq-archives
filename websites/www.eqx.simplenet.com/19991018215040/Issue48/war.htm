   The mist falling from high above settled with the dew from the ground below, the grass remained still, quiet, peaceful. In the distance a hawk cried as it could be heard diving into a lake to fetch it's morning meal; the wind passing through the lake-side reeds could be witnessed throughout Antonica. Then, through the wisps of wind, and the peaceful sounds of the plains of Karana, the sound of a low, roar came from the north.
<br><br>
   From the south, a massive chain-mail clad boot crashed down upon the only wildflower in the Karanan fields. Sir Brenton glanced down at the broken stem underneath his foot, then focused his attention toward the north. He  squinted his war torn face and twisted his orange beard, as he strained to listen to the approaching sound.
<br><br>
 "Tis two regiments" he thought to himself, " from the sound of it, two <em>large</em> regiments."
<br><br>
   Brenton clicked his heels and proceeded to his tent where he would decide how to prevent a complete slaughter. He made his way down the carefully positioned forest to where the bulk of his army remained. As he passed his soldiers, he noticed that many of them, exhausted from the long trek to Karana, lay sprawled among the weeds. Only his five trusted officers stood at attention as he ducked below the tent entrance. It was going to be a long morning indeed.

"Almost there now gents, keep up the pace!"
<br><br>
Erik glanced back at his comrades, as each and everyone one of them pulled on. The clip-clop of iron-cladded heavy horses was accompanied by the hooting and hollering of 10,000 war-bound barbarians; both noises combined to make a fearful roar.
<br><br>
   The five men leading the advancing M'gol army were dressed alike, all bearing the same grin that every native barbarian gets when war is coming. Each one, Erik, Lief, Bjorn, Jacks, and Hund were wearing the finest Halas war plate given to those only who were able to overcome a Mammoth bare handed.
 <br><br>
   "Tis going to be a great day for battle, isn't it lad?" Erik said as he  turned to face the only monk in his army, making sure he would not miss a step in his brisk pace.
<br><br>
   "Aye, sir" Hund replied. 
<br><br>
   Erik knew that Hund  never was a man of many words so he didn't take offense to the little recognition that the monk gave him. Both looked forward and resumed concentration of overcoming the only hill before the Karana Plain. The other three M'gol leaders were glancing around nervously, and sweating heavily as the plates on their armor clanged together; they were starting to lag behind.
<br><br>
   "Just up this hill men, and then on to victory!" cried Erik.
<br><br>
   
			
   The entire M'gol army scrambled up the hill, many gasping and panting. The Barbarians let out a horrifying war cry as they spilled over the side of the hill, and into view of the last regiment of the Freeport army. Erik slowly trumped out of his  jog and came to a halt as he signaled for each of his officers to begin forming the army.
<br><br>
   "Archers in Front! Horses behind! Infantry in Mid! " flags rose and parroted orders could be heard echoing throughout the entire army. The M'gol army was ready for battle.
<br><br>

   "Sire! The Barbs approach!" 
<br><br>
   A teenage knave came running into Brenton's quarters, stumbling over the weapons and maps that were strewn about all over the tent floor.
<br><br>
    "Sire! Didn't you he..."
<br><br>
  Sir Brenton cut him off and placed his muscular finger over his lips, informing the knave to be quiet. He swiveled around and faced a person who was huddled over a large map with several carved and painted figures that were arranged much like a chess board. The man glanced up from his map and over at Brenton.
<br><br>
   "Is it time already?" The old man questioned softly, his tone indicating that time was not on their side.
<br><br>
    "Aye sir, it is" replied Brenton.
<br><br>
   Sir Brenton and his father, knave following, exited from the tent and were greeted by the now standing, and alive, Freeport army. He retraced his steps back up the dirt pathway to the battleground overlook. Things were looking up for the city-state of Freeport, the army was refreshed, the mist was lifting off of the grass, and <em>he</em> had a plan. 
<br><br>
   "Fetch my steed, knave, and be quick about it!" said the captain to the jester-like kid. He waited patiently for the knave to bring his stallion, all the while glancing over the M'gol army several miles out. The sheer size of it made him think he could see each and every painted Barbarian face among it's ranks. Brenton knew was about to meet with the leader of the M'gols under a truce. He had heard the stories of the man named Erik the savage, a mindless tyrant who had killed as many of his own men as he had taken on wives...
<br><br>
   The captain's thoughts were interrupted by the whinny of a horse, and the panting of a clumsy young boy who was holding reigns. He mounted his steed, raised a white flag, clicked his heels, and rode out into the center of the vast plain of Karana.
<br><br>

   "Sire," Hund said softly, as usual, "You had better go."		
	<br><br>
   Erik looked at him and nodded, then turned to face the silvery figure with the white flag. The leader of the M'gol army did not believe in riding a horse, he much preferred to walk; it was far more intimidating, and impressive to greet a foe head on, on foot. He looked down at the ground, let out a gruff sigh, then proceeded to greet the leader of the Freeport army. The M'gols cheered and hollered. As they watched their leader trek toward his mounted foe.
