Out in the blackness, with the moon in full flight<br>
Cast your gaze skyward;<br>
hear the stars' plight.<br>
The west stars are passive,<br>
the east stars love fight,<br>
The north shines alone dear,<br>
and I fear the light.<br>
You've taken my heart dear,<br>
beyond the night's reach,<br>
You've taken my soul dear,<br>
Alas, I have need of each.
<br><br>
Out in the blackness, with the mist swirling white,<br>
Cast your faith outward;<br>
feel the fog's might.<br>
The haze knows its power,<br>
the murk is twilight,<br>
My soul wanders out there,<br>
and my love I recite.<br>
You've stolen my life dear,<br>
hid where I dare not go,<br>
You've touched deep my heart dear,<br>
Can you feel my love flow?
<br><br>
Out in the blackness, where wind seems to freeze<br>
Let your soul free now;<br>
let it ride the breeze.<br>
The wind howls for freedom,<br>
It screams only wheeze.<br>
the crisp air blows truth dear,<br>
I hear a mere tease.<br>
My soul rides the winds dear,<br>
beyond the world's breach,<br>
It searches for yours dear,<br>
On the clouds, on the beach.
<br><br>
Down on the seashore, where the waters foam white,<br>
Hang your head over;<br>
hear the winds flight.<br>
I asked you to dance dear,<br>
right from the start.<br>
I wanted your love dear,<br>
with all of my heart.<br>
Oft times you hurt me,<br>
and oft times we fought.<br>
But if you should leave me,<br>
My life, will been for naught.
<br><br>
Under the mountains, where dwarves often call<br>
Throw your hands upward,<br>
hear my love's call.<br>
Your smile warms me full dear,<br>
Heals me from the fall<br>
Your eyes sparkle life dear,<br>
I love you all.<br>
I'll fight to the end dear,<br>
For you go through hell,<br>
I'll not let you down dear,<br>
I love, Camrielle.<br>
So cast your gaze skyward' hear the stars' plight<br>
Cast your gaze skyward; hear the stars' plight.
