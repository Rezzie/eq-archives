Ozat did'nt like the woman really.  She was very pretty, yes, and any man would
certainly desire her attentions, but he was old, and not any man.  He saw through the
pale milky skin and raven black tresses, past the pretty face and into the real
person that stood before him. And what he saw, was....nothing.  Euphoria, they called
her.  No known real name, no relatives,  no friends; no acquaintanses at all as far
as Ozat knew.  Which was probably the main reason he did'nt like the woman.
Information was his buisness, and when it came to Euphoria quite simply there was
none.  Ozat did'nt like being in the dark, and rarely was.  Yet here she stood;
known by all who lived on the darker side of virtue, yet not truly known by any
living being.

Early attempts at conversation had long since been abandoned.  Another annoyance to
add to the list.  Ozat relied on his powers of observation and knowledge gained
through that observation.  He had had decades to perfect his interrogation skills,
and could scribe a detailed report on ony man from just a few minutes of smalltalk.
His was the art of subtelty; people reveal things they never even know they reveal,
and he was a master of absorning those slips, and of nurturing them until he had what
he wanted.  Foiled again, he was.  Such a closed book he had never seen as this pale
shadow in front of him, and never wanted to again.

Yet she came highly recommended, and he needed this errand done with absolutly no
mistakes, so here she was.  With her all black atire emphasizing her pale face, she
stood as a shadow awaiting his next words.  From what Ozat could deduce she seemed to
be quite young, somthing that bothered him yet again about her, but he had reliable
sources on her skill and success.  A black riding cloak, hooded, hung limp from her
shoulders and a loose , long sleeved blouse was tucked into snug black leather
breeches.  Her feet and legs were covered by tall thigh boots, dripping mud from the
street onto his floor.   All appeared to be well-tailored, though travel worn, and
the black bandana around her head revealed ears adorned with black pearl earrings.
Not wealthy then, but certainly not a pauper.
