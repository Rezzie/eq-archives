	<big><big>T</big></big>o celebrate the coming of closed beta testing I have written much ramble about one of the main reasons we have beta tests. Hopefully this sparks a few people to want to test instead of play during the beta.

<em>Those guys next door would be the death of him. Mr Winters had been the best weapon smith in the valley for 2 years since he retired as a warrior and a miner. Mr Winters now made swords for a living, and also ran a public smiths shop for others to use his anvil and forge. This property strip was valuable, and one day this unlikely couple moved in next door, spotting the huge lease fee for the space and setting up yet another smithy. A High Elf Enchantress and a Dwarven smith took turns running the new shop. One day the smith would come and bang out excellent weapons and then the next the Elf would come and weave spells over them. They obviously avoided some hidden overhead cost by never manning the shop at the same time, which is something Winters thought would increase the speed of manufacturing a bit. Neither of his new neighbors were much for conversation, which Winters attributed to being not of the human strain. He had met plenty of elves who spoke fluent common but there were the few like his neighbors who talked very little at all. Now the most common customer at the new shop, he could carry on for days about his famous kills and treasure hoard. Hah, people... Winters might never understand people, so much like living tools but not nearly as predictable. Mr Winters didn't go without food for long before putting up an ad for a potent Enchanter to come work for him in his shop to stay in Business. He sought to run the shop together with his hired help but found that no one cared to run the shop with him. He then guessed that the hidden costs must mean something, or that enchanters needed space to run this type of operation, he didn't know but he then sought an Enchanter who was willing to work alone while he slept, like his competition.</em>

<em>Down the street a professional locksmith once stood in the line at the church waiting for hand-outs, and begging for food. True he was not in the best standing with the law but he was a religious man, and always prayed for answers to his professional dilemma. He was illiterate but very skilled with tools, and even stayed in business when competing with his gnome competition. However, since a school for Wizards was opened in the valley no one has needed a locksmith, nor has there been any requests for his other services, since everything was magically enchanted now. Even though the mages charged a stiff price for some of the same services the quality a mage could give was top notch, and magically so. His skill came and went, not being mathematically perfect each attempt like the mages. One day in a drunken fever he saw the "answer" to his dilemma and has been in prison even since on murder charges, awaiting his sentence. Meanwhile a mage shop was opened where his old shop used to be.</em>

<em>In a barren field a crows flight away two men bashed at each other with claymores for weeks on end, seemingly never to get tired and never to give up. An equally as patient healer stood near to apply bandages to each combatant, who occasionally took swings with his war hammer at either warrior. Three men walked by the field and remarked at how strange of a sight it was, three men wounding each other on purpose, and asked what god brought them to this madness. The only reply, from each in union, was "practicing". Practicing for what? The reply was practicing "so we can mosh with ogres. Ogres are tougher than goblins and all the goblins got hunted out by Ogre hunters." Why must ye wound each other when you are practicing? The reply, each time asked was "cause it is more like real combat, and you learn faster than when training with a teacher or training with non-lethal weapons." The three walking men were flabbergasted at the logic. The healer replied, "I also only learn when I attend to real wounds". Again the walking men were sickened at the activity. The two warriors stopped and asked if the visitors were new in town, and they said yes. The two warriors then tried to explain that they would understand after they tried to go hunting goblins and found none, and that no amount of non-lethal practice could prepare them to encounter the monsters that were still alive out in the wilderness. They then tried to explain that this is why they fought each other. The three walked off, and went goblin hunting, and hunted for a month with different results, but in the end one of those three was now sparring with the other warriors in the barren field. The other two men had retired and moved on, allowing for some young mages to move into the old houses.</em>
