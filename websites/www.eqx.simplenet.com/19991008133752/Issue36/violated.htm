My question to the EQ community is why does a good thing have to be tainted by a few bad people? You may wonder why I am asking this when we are all not in the game playing it together just yet, but I have a very good reason. Some beta tester chose to break his or her NDA and post the beta manual. This not only angers me, but makes me wonder if the good people will outweigh the bad.
<br><br>
	Sure a lot of you are happy to read the beta manual. Everybody wants more information on EQ, even though there is a plethora of it out there already, we still crave more. So now you are asking why it was a bad thing the beta manual was posted. I have some good explanations for that also. You may agree or disagree but I am going to say it anyway.
<br><br>
	The folks down at 989 Studios have been more than fair with their release of information and I feel that the person who stabbed them in the back is very evil and doesn't deserve to be in the beta. There are many others out there that would have gladly have taken their spot and probably would have kept their mouths shut. 
<br><br>
	Brad has been great with our little community. Showing up in irc to be berated with questions, the monthly chats, and periodical releasing of screenshots. He also takes time to read the various forums to answer questions. He puts 100% into this game. To be a beta tester, under NDA, is something a lot of people would literally kill for, but one person had to go and stab Brad in the back. If I were Brad I would be very angry about this.	
<br><br>
	He holds the right to release what information he wants when he wants it to be released to the public. Beta testers do not! If he wanted everybody on the net to read EQ's beta manual he would have posted it himself. Next thing you know people will be posting screenshots and various other tidbits even though they aren't supposed to. Is this fair to Brad? Is this fair to those not in the beta? I would answer no to both questions. It surely isn't fair to Brad who has accommodated us with knowledge he didn't have to already. For those not in the beta, it isn't fair because now you have more of a taste and are fiending to play even more.
<br><br>
	Things from beta will change, and I believe that is why Brad hasn't released every last tidbit of information on EQ. Some things are also better left up to the imagination, as in skills for each class, starting spells, so on and so forth. Also, there are competitors out there who would love to get their hands on this information so they can adjust their games to compete with EQ. This could damage EQ and or Brad personally, and in my opinion is damn near sacrilege.
<br><br>
	So how bad will this community become when we are all in game? We can't even seem to act like adults when we aren't in the game. Some of those in game seem to not be able to act like adults violating a legal document that could lead to them being banned from the game. Why is this all necessary? These questions really don't have objective answers so they will get me nowhere quickly. I just feel violated by one person's indiscretions and wanted to let out some rage.
<br><br>
	In closing I would like to send out my apologies to Brad and 989 Studios for that one person on behalf of the good people in the EQ community. We are not all vile disgusting people Brad! If there were anything I could do to help rectify this situation I would gladly do it! Hopefully nothing like this happens again. Once again sorry for letting out some rage, but I felt it necessary.
