<em>[Ed. - Due to the tremendous volume of responses to my <a href="../Issue90/edita.htm">editorial</a> last week I've decided to put them
all on a seperate page.  To read them, click <a href="letters2.htm">HERE</a>.]</em>

I have ahd a problem with a repeatable crash bug in EQ and the only
response to the ten communications (in game and E-mail) has been "don't
use those keys."
<br><br>
While I try not to, and the combination is not a common one, it still
seems to me that a programmer ought to take a different attitude to a
repeatable crash bug.
<br><br>
Here's the deal: if you strafe (holding down the control key, not
remappable as far as I can see), and try to drop your target(either in
panic or to see if someone has picked off the beast) (hitting the
escape key), you will be dropped to your ISP screen, and you can listen
to yourself die, but you cannot re-enter the game.  I have had this
happen four times now (only twice since I verified the combo-crash).  I
know I should not hit the keys, but neither can be remapped, and EQ
should fix crash bugs, right?  I have no reason to think that this is
just me, and no understanding of why Verant does not reply at all in
the two weeks since my first report (aside from "we got your
mail,thanks").
<br><br>
Why don't you try it yourself, safely in town perhaps, and consider
asking publicly why a crash bug should be "fixed" by telling those
afflicted not to use the keys involved.

For a while i have been telling my friends that we need to be able to write 
scrolls and write little guides to things in books.  Maybe write a book that 
outlines a quest we have done and sell it to someone, maybe use them as plot 
devices.  We need to be able to name them and write anything we want in 
them!  Komax's Tinkering guide etc........ heh heh heh, that would be great. 
<br><br>
  They would also be great plot devices.  Maybe take out the /t function 
from the racewar servers so messages need to be delivered via messengers... 
this opens up a new trade....... someone with SOW and invisibility could 
make a mint running messages!  You could write the stuff in any language you 
are fluent in and if the message is intercepted and you can't read that 
language, it is all garbled!  Maybe it is extreme taking out the /t 
function, but i figure racewar is supposed to be more about roleplaying and 
they didn't exactly have cellular phones back then... LOL.  Well, just a 
little feedback.

Hi,
<br><br>
I would point out that Tolkien, being a scholar of the early English language and its ancestors, "translated" Middle Earth names into 
Earth-equivalents. Thus Frodo, Meriadoc, Peregrin, etc., are actual names from Frankish, Gothic, and other Earth languages related to English. (The 
appendices at the end of "Return of the King" discuss this, including the truly alphabet-soupish real names of the same characters.) 
<br><br>
I'm sure you'll get eight thousand emails with the same nitpick, but what the heck. :)
<br><br>
Geoff Speare
<br><br>
<em>Actually, you're the only one to mention this information one way or
another.
<br><br>
My point is how the names are perceived.  The average person jumping into a
fantasy game is not going to know the origin of such names, but he/she will
know the origins of the typical kewldOOd name and thus a bit of the veneer
of fantasy is stripped away by real-world nonsense.  As you pointed out,
they may not fit into the "alpha-bet soup" category, but they are so
abstract to the average fantasy RPG player that they may as well be.
<br><br>
I'm always glad to get letters from informed readers (Even ones that make me
look bad :D).  Thanks for reading!

I definately agree with your point of view on that player's <a href="../Issue90/letters.htm">letter</a>. Besides, with a name like "Guardkiter" and a quote like "Difficulty does not equal balance," I'll bet he has a few other opinions I (and possibly you) would disagree with. :)
 <br><br>
Keep up the great work.

I feel for you.<br>
It's amazing how people can rationalize something and then defend it so
righteously. In my own experience, it's almost impossible to argue with
these people, they know they're wrong but have too much pride to admit
it. I'm sorry you got so much flames on this issue, but people get
touchy when you attack something they're uncomfertable about. Just
writting to say that I'm 110% behind you on this issue. It's sad really
how easy people delude themselves into thinking something is right when
they know it's wrong.

PS. Another nice analogy for people exploiting bugs is this: If you go
to an ATM at the bank, and withdrawl 20 dollars, but the machine gives
you 200 dollars without charging your account and you keep that money
it's wrong. if you do it repeatedly it makes it even worse. It's
illegal, simple.
<br><br>
PPS. Okay that sounded better in my mind... most things do, bare with
me.

Just read Archanalia's article in Issue 90, Felony: Nameslaughter and
I'm happy to see this issue addressed again.  This is one of my pet
peeves! It's jarring to cross paths with someone named Deadagain or
Cyberbyte.... I'd hoped Verant would have a better filter.
<br><br>
Another tip for those who are trying to come up with a new name - if
you  choose to get the help of the random generator, play with
variations on what it comes up with - try saying the names out loud, and
simplify the spelling, take out strange characters, remove a syllable,
whatever. For example, you might get Trelxianl - try Trexian, Trelian,
Trelan, Relxia (probably female) till you get one you like.  
<br><br>
Oh one more group of silly names - the I-made-this-so-I-can-loot-first
category. I'm always amused when I find names inspired by aardvarks -
Aanthi, Aaarom, Aaal....sure, you can be in my group - but we're looting
by reverse alpha order today ok?

I have done something in game that I think borders on exploitation. I know some would disagree with me and maybe it's not the classic exploit, but it did make me feel a little greasy...at first. I stumbled onto a quest. It is a quest that can only be done by a certain class/race combo. The reward is high for the difficulty and I very much wanted to get that reward. So I rolled up that class/race combo with no intention of playing beyond the time it took to complete the quest and get the item I wanted. Now I know what I did was cheap, but the item that I got for it was something that I certainly could not have obtained through more honorable methods. There are items roughly comparable to it and indeed far superior, but as a 14th Cleric with little material wealth playing in the often harsh environment of Talon Zek I had little chance at them.
 <br><br>
In your opinion is what I did an exploit? I'm not kidding myself and saying I did a good thing, but as the days roll on and I see classes outpacing me for desirable items I feel less and less like I misused the game and more and more like I just used knoweldge (A non-class advantage I had) to afford myself something that would not have been availible to me within the paramaters of the game. The class I chose to play is very group dependent. I am not bemoaning that choice. I love playing the character, but when I see the same arch-type classes shooting to the fore front the way they have on the other servers I have played it makes me think that I should take advantage of what opportunities I can. It irks me to shell out my hard earned plats to a player holding 50 of the item I have only dreamed of possessing. Items he possesses because he chose the sure fire rout and does not have to share his loot with other group members.
 <br><br>
Anyway, I just wanted your take on it. In many ways I feel (Or maybe I just try to tell myself I do) like the starving man that steals a loaf of bread.

<em>[Ed. - Exploit... no, I don't think it is.  An exploit requires the use/abuse of a failure in the game mechanics.  I'm not clear about what you did with the item.  If you passed it along to the other character, then I'd be tempted to shout twink at you loudly.  If not, then I would suggest that you have done nothing more then breach in role-playing etiquette by using out of character knowledge to advance a character.  Something that I don't like, but certainly nothing criminal.]</em>
