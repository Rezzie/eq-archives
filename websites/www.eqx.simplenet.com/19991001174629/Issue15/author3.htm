Whatever concept you use, flesh it out by asking questions about him/her.  Have a "conversation" with your character. "Where did you come from? What are your goals?  What was your happiest moment?  Your saddest moment?  Why did you become a [class]?  What about being a [race] helped you most in life? What helped least? If you could be an animal, what animal would you be?"  It is recommended that you do this silently, to avoid being misunderstood or overheard in class :).

Put your character in hypothetical situations, to see how they would react.  How would a "god from another plane" react to being questioned by a town guard?  What would a warrior do if he was followed around by wizards asking him to let then train him in magery? Imagine what the character would do when s/he walked into an inn… would s/he go right to the bar and start telling jokes?  Would s/he sit against the back wall facing the door?  From this discussion will come a solid character concept, which you could translate into a character biography.

Note: there are many excellent character creation tips on Everquest sites.  Read as many of them as you can, as a different presentation of the same idea can jog your mind to go in a different, better direction.
