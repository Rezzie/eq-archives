Death.  It should be one of the biggest things on all of our minds in Norrath.  Hummm... maybe? Oh wait!  I see a hand in the front, "No mine is, Saving others!"  Good paladin answer.  Oh!  Another one, "I wanna be more Bashy!" &lt;Nods in approval&gt; I can see that... Yes you &lt;points&gt; in the back, you had an answer? "I want to confuse and live by it!"  Great!  Wonderful! What can you do as far as horned helms?
<br><br>
Is this what's really on our minds as we go through Norrath?  Is that all... the ability to do something that anyone else can do without some incredible efforts thrown in here or there?  If so, where's the pride in our deeds?
<br><br>
I do not mean that an enchanter, whose knowledge and abilities can allow the stars to swirl before another's eyes, means nothing.  Not at all, that is wonderful!  Wonderful and safe.  While we are all safe, how is worth and achievement actually measured?
<br><br>
There are a few ways it can be.  First that comes to mind is just that.  First!  I am first to be able to cast a spell that makes stars reel before you in the night sky!  "Ohhhhh, ahhhhh!" we all say.  I am SECOND to cast reeling stars before you! ... I am THIRD, I AM FOURTH!  &lt;whispers&gt; Anyone else yawning yet?
<br><br>
Where does the worth of our characters come from in this false world that we escape to?  Friends?  Yes indeed!  Friends are the greatest treasure... when?  Forgive if I answer that a big part of that is, when they are needed most. When is that in a RPG?  When your the "Fourth" casting the stars in a spiral and she/he's the only one clapping? Or perhaps, just perhaps, when there's spirals of a different view.
<br><br>
Below you see a staircase, spiraling like your stars.  The yells around you are foreign, your name on their lips and air heavy with words that cause mist to form and heat to hit your body.  Within that staircase  you see a river... yours.  Your life pouring out, no dam to stop it, your friends unable to help except that one, last tiny burst.
<br><br>
This whole time you have sat and watched life leave you almost helpless to prevent it. Many things flash through your head.  Let's look at two basic things that could flash through our minds when we are about to die:

<OL>

<LI>&lt;sigh&gt;  now I have to kill borers for another two hours to get back where I was.  Let alone run for 20 minutes because I didn't bind outside of the dwarves home.</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Denialle better dang well be friggen GRATEFUL at the skilling I have to do so she could get that new staff.</LI>
<LI>At least, this running for 20 minutes is nothing considering that Denialle now has +5 mana regen on top of mediate with that new staff and it hits for as much as a basic 2-handed sword on the top end!</LI></OL>
<br>

<LI>Oh please... Oh please... don't let me die!  I can't afford to loose ten permanent hit points!  I am a CASTER/HYBRID!  *do* you know how many times that 10 has saved my life!</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Denialle better dang well save me or she's never gonna pay off those perm lost 10 HPs.  If I have to re-roll because I can't live without, she's gonna be giving up loot left and right!</LI>
<LI>If Denialle gets the staff from my death the price maybe high but worth it.  I was glad to be apart of this.</LI></OL>
</OL>

I have two very opposing views for a purpose, never mind that they have all crossed my own mind at one point in time at various fights in various games.  The latter, because I went, I fought, and almost failed for of one reason.  Me!
<br><br>
I didn't make sure I had covered my bases when leading a hunt. Walking into something that could beat the snot out of me and not making sure my party is on the same track, is a scatterbrained or arrogant thing to do and I should pay for it.  I relied on the fact that someone else must have told my group how to fight the monster we were up against, that ALMOST cost me dearly.  By dearly, I risked over 6 months of work on a character, plus a 5 to 10 perm hit points that could not be made back up, in a 30 minute lair fight.  Heart beat in comparison, very stupid on my part.  VERY stupid. I walked away from that fight with a sack completely empty of heals, and a trail of smashed heal bottles behind me.  I scrounged the floor in the middle of the battle, looting the gaurds or any other corpses to stay alive.  In this game my character was at terrible odds when I started scraping for anything to live.  Yes she took on the worst of death and beat it.  It was during this sloppy fight that I realized fate could sneak up and thwap the crap out of you.  You were *never* above death, only your precautions could delay it somewhat.  Every time I got hit, every time I sucked up an empty looted heal bottle only to hope the next was full, my stomach would flip-flop.  I could feel my heart racing, actually RACING.  I am surprised my party couldn't hear it hammering away through the Internet.  If I fell, all of them would fall and loose just as much as I would.
<br><br>
That is a FIGHT!  I don't mean the sloppy part, I haven't been since.  It's the fact that this could happen on an "even" lair fight and particular on one "over your head".   It's the fact that in these fights you are groping to use almost every last little burst, punch,  kick, heal, buff, available to you and you still only win by a hair.  The lair or holders of the powerful items were absolutely vicious! That is what going against the leader of an evil tribe as a paladin should be like!  How do you make them so?  How do you take players, who want nothing more sometimes than relaxation, into your world and have them want to fight such beasts?  Two things, make it exciting and make it worth it.
<br><br>
The "Making a fight worth it" is easy.  The worth is something that allows the Power Gamer or Relaxation Player to step up in life for a time.  Until they, of course, seek to kill the next monster that steps the character up even higher than before.
<br><br>
The "make it exciting" is just as simple.  You put a high price on failure.  Should there be a high price to anything that we go to relax in?  Funny that this question should be asked.  How many reading this play golf, own their own set of clubs and a membership to a course?  How many out there water ski and have taken a hard fall?  Snow ski maybe?  How about horseback riding?  While golf might not have a high factor for actual injury, unless you're driving the cart drunk, a lot of our activities do and they are not cheap.  Being able to do something, do it well or to our own satisfaction, and beat the odds is one reason why we all have these "relaxation" activities.  The other is to talk to people who enjoy the same pursuit.  Not too much different from on-line gaming.  The argument could be made that if you make the price to high on failure, people won't play.
<br><br>
So what stops either the Power Gamer or Relaxation Player from wanting to take such risks?  What stops a player like me who would trash their character for their close friends?  Only one thing, it's NOT worth it!  This is one of the finest lines any developer has to walk.   To date, I have seen only ONE developer get it right for items of worth.  That one developer that had my heart hammering against my chest and my stomach flopping over. Pictures of death were not running through my mind as I was grabbing bottles of the floor and breaking them so I wouldn't pick them up twice.  Not the sort of pictures which would entail "Okay run from restart spot, find someone to cast a spell on me so nothing can hurt me, get stuff."  No, running through my mind was "OH PLEASE! PLEASE, PLEASE let the next heal go through! OH GEEZ don't let that monster stun me again, only two more attacks and we will MAKE IT!  Oh I can't take another hit of this one doesn't work!"  This went on for a good five to ten minutes.   Honestly, each exchange seemed to take forever and take no time at all.  I was so wound up on LIVING, holding my breath, and in the background thinking, "This is it... IT CAN'T BE IT", that when the monster finally drop I sat there completely stunned.  Two seconds later my head was in my hands followed by a *flood* of relief and happy exhaustion.  Actually my hands were shaking, and my palms sweaty so I didn't keep my head there long.  Call me crazy, but I call that a FIGHT!  I call that IMMERSION!
<br><br>
We are back to judging worth.  You work 60 hours a week, you can't keep up with everyone else, but you find people like you.  You get to Nasty-Guy, by this time you have bought 5 Nasty-Guy weapons for you and your friends. *Is* he worth it?
<br><br>
You work 40 hours a week.  You can't keep up with the top levels, but you find people like you.  You get to Nasty-Guy, by this time you have paid 20 pp over the current going rate for nasty guy weapons.  *Is* he worth it?
<br><br>
You can be on-line all the time, despite work.  You have really no competition, and also no one to save you.  You kill Nasty-Guy and start selling his stuff in a dreadful battle because you're alone in the area and monsters are everywhere.  By doing so, others now kill Nasty-Guy easily. *Was* it worth it?
<br><br>
Only one thing can make all of these fights worth it when a player, new or old faces Nasty-Guy.   That each time you face Nasty-Guy, you do stand to *loose* something that can possibly be gone forever or extremely difficult to get back.  That the last thing you ever want to do while standing against Nasty-Guy is to get sloppy, even though he's now "green" to you.  Make it worth it.  Make the fights against all the Nasty-Guys out there an experience, instead of just experience.  Make the Nasty-Guys something, instead of what they are now...  bloated monsters that escaped from the newbie area.
