My daughter, Bethany, has taken up playing EQ with me. She really loves the
game, and since it is so lifelike and immersive she sometimes gets
completely oblivious to the fact that it's happening on the computer and not
real (sound like anyone YOU know?).
<br><br>
There are a few things I've learned from her watching me play. I figured the
development team might want to make sure the game is acceptable for
"younger" players... *grin* Most of these are pretty much direct quotes from
my daughter.
<br><br>
1. Mobs aren't really dying, they're just "going into timeout".
<br><br>
2. The red spells are better than the green spells. And the blue spells
should be cast ALOT (I was playing a cleric...go figure...)
<br><br>
3. Hey you! Get away from my daddy's bad guy! (The idea of sharing is still
foreign to this child...obviously...)
<br><br>
4. That lightning is going to strike you. You should go inside when it's
raining. Your clothes are going to get stinky.
<br><br>
5. If nobody is in a house, you should take it. It has a nice fireplace and
a bunkbed.
<br><br>
And finally...for the development team...
<br><br>
6. "Don't knock my daddy down so much!"
<br><br>
Hehe
<br><br>
Proud Father of the EQ Generation.
