He had been to this place before.  It was always this dark, this moist.  And he had seen this creature before.  He had fought this battle before.  But hadn’t he killed this thing already?  Why should it be here again?  That made no difference, he would just kill it again.
<br><br>
It tried to strike him, but he was too fast.  He was always too fast.  The thing was quite stupid, really.  It always tried to strike him in the head.  But his head was the easiest thing to move out of the way.  If it were only smart enough to aim for his body it might actually defeat him.  But he was once again certain he would defeat it.  At the same time he was also certain that this battle would happen again, later.

He smelled something now, something new.  Not truly new, for he recognized the scent.  He glanced and saw the new enemy approaching.  He would have to be swift if he were going to be able to defeat his current enemy and still have time to flee from the new ones.  For the new ones were too numerous, and even his quickness would not save him from them.  But neither would they save it from him.

Again it stuck.  It seemed to become unbalanced as he again evaded its attack.
He knew this was the last moment of the battle.  He took the opening and attacked.
He pierced it at its midsection.  It struggled a moment.  Its death cries seemed to
keep the new enemies away, seemed to make them hesitate.  Good.  For this gave him
time to grasp the creature by its lower appendage and drag it back into it’s lair.
It’s single tooth fell from its upper appendage with a disturbing noise.
<br><br>
He would be sated for a time, until the battle began afresh, as it always did.
