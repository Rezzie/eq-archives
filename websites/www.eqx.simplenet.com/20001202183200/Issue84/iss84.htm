<br><br>
    Kinory woke up in a small stone cell, with a massive headache and a feeling of unreality.  Late afternoon sun streamed through the tiny slit of a window, high above her head.  Her woodland senses strangled by the confinement, she squinted at the brightness and tried to estimate how long she had been out.

Carl Jung developed the theory of the collective unconscious - the group of inherited feelings, thoughts, instincts and memories shared by all humanity.  It is differentiated from the personal unconscious - the repressed feelings and thoughts developed during an individual's life together with unfolded life possibilities and much more.  In other words, Jung believed that there was a sort of "group unconsciousness" that existed outside the realm of our normal mind and reality, which affected our ways of thinking and patterns of behavior.  This group unconsciousness is made up of what he called archetypes.

Fire beetles.  Snakes.  Shadow wolves bounding from behind one tree to behind the next.

There's a pattern to their seemingly endless meandering.  To one who does not stand back and see the whole picture it would all appear to be random and senseless.  Chaos, I believe is the term that the prophets put on it.  But they're so concerned with looking beyond the mundane to capture some glimpse of the future and what it holds that they'll never know what I know.  And all I had to do was leave it all behind and view it from a distance to understand.

It can be daunting at first to learn to roleplay if you’ve never done it before, and I hope this series of articles will help the new roleplayer feel more confidant or at the very least experiment with some of the things talked about in these stories.  In my last article I talked about how to use or avoid using certain words in your speech to add to the roleplaying atmosphere of Norrath.  But roleplaying isn’t all about how you talk, either, it’s also your actions and your feelings (Let your feelings go, Luke).  That’s where emotes come in.

So what do I do with a week off?  With the exception of a very successful trip to Las Vegas, I do nothing differently than I do every week, except with more sleeping and no working.  For me, heaven would have to involve at least nine hours of sleep every night.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Q & A in issue 83 someone asked how to make a macro... My question is how do I memorize spells into the hotkey spots on the bottom left like those on the screenshot shown. I have asked people in game but they always say just click on the spell in the book and grad to the left. I want them on the bottom as well.. thanks for your help 
</I><BR>
<br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell starts all over again.  I call it "refreshing" the spell, and when I'm in a group I will do it before the buff drops when I am flush with mana and waiting for other casters to rest, so I don't find myself having to buff when I am low on mana.
