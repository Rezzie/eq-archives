 "Die, evil beast!" Raylend Kinsar raised his sword and stared into 
the gaping maw of the thirty foot long snake poised in front of him. Sweat 
dripped from his brow, blurring his vision slightly, but the knowledge that 
this was a life or death situation kept him focused on the serpent. Its 
teeth were razor sharp, and its scaly skin rippled as it slithered its way 
ever closer. For a brief instant, his thoughts went to how he came to find 
himself in this situation.

It had been not two moons ago that he arrived in Arendakor, a 
relatively small town on the banks of a winding river at the center of 
Antonica. It was no coincidence that the river was named The Serpent, 
and ran through a mountain range named Serpent's Spine. Raylend needed 
only pause in the Rusty Ale tavern for a moment before he overheard the 
townsfolk voicing their worries.

A ragged, bearded man sat at a table with a smaller, balding man. 
"Aye, if that slithering abomination comes near my house, you can bet it 
will have my axe buried in its skull," he boasted. "If it doesn't get you 
first," his companion retorted. Raylend noticed a hesitation in their voices 
that betrayed their fear.
