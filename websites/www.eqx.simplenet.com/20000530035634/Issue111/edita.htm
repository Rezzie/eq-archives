We've all heard the tales about folks losing characters due to crash bugs.  Not characters dying, or losing items, but characters just disappearing.  It's probably the worst thing that can happen to a player.  The whole character, gone.  A terrible loss.
<br><br>
Some people would complain about all of the time that they lost with the character.  Well, that's not strictly true, or it shouldn't be.  That time shouldn't have been lost.  If I go and see a terrible movie, I've lost time.  If I go and see a great movie, I've been entertained.  If your experience playing the character was like a bad movie then perhaps you should be happy it's gone.  When you lose a character you don't lose his past.
<br><br>
And it's not the loss of stuff that matters either, really.  It's not the loss of a powerful character, it's the loss that character's future that should hurt the most.  It's the fact that he won't be able to go on and be more than he was before.  He won't be able to meet new people and see new things, bringing his unique view of the world to bear on them.  He won't be able to evolve into what ever he would have been.
<br><br>
I'm not bringing this up because I've lost a character in EverQuest.  I haven't.  In fact, I've had few technical problems at all in my many months with EverQuest.  Though in that time, and especially lately, I've not played as many hours as most people would, I've logged enough hours to be somewhat surprised that I've not had such troubles.  Since beta I've only called a guide once, and that was to help a friend get his corpse out of a wall.
<br><br>
I was thinking about this because I recently lost a character for our pen and paper game.  I've had characters die and stay dead.  For some of them it was a perfect way to end their time with us.  I played a very aggressive warrior a long time ago.  Over the course of his life he learned to hate spell casters of all sorts, even priests.  He had a tendency to run off on his own pursuing his own needs.  And he would attack almost anything that pissed him off.  One day he ran into an anti-paladin that taunted him while he was paralyzed.  The rest of the group drove the anti-paladin away and turned to fight some other enemy.  My character went after the anti-paladin the very second that his paralyzation wore off.
<br><br>
They fought a bit, and it became clear that my character was a better swordsman than the bad guy.  At the time the character was grossly overloaded with powerful stuff.  He was a gruesome piece of work, by far the most powerful character I've ever had.  So the anti-paladin took off.  I pursued.
<br><br>
He ran and took a position behind this silly looking skull.  It was a Human skull on a post.  The skull sat at about chest height.  The anti-paladin was playing tag with me from behind the skull, taunting me.  Well my character would have none of that, and decided to bust the skull up with his exceptionally powerful artifact-like sword (thank goodness THAT thing is out of the game now…).  Well, it turns out that the skull was a demi-lich.  The second my character landed a blow, his soul was sucked into the skull and devoured over the course of several hours.  There's no recovering from that…
<br><br>
My party could have saved me if they had known where he had run off to, or if they liked him enough to even care that he was lost.  It was the perfect death for that character.  It was the kind of death that he had been working up to for years.  Run off alone and die because you're too angry and too arrogant to look before you swing.  Sure, I regret his death.  He was fun to play.  But I certainly wouldn't refer to the loss of that character as a waste of my time.  When we sit around and reminisce about the old days he still comes up.  What he was isn't lost.
<br><br>
But last week I actually <b>lost</b> a character.  We restarted our monster campaign, where we're all playing humanoids in a world of tribal chiefs, bullies and much grunting.  Why is it that I'm the only one playing a character that doesn't speak of himself in the third person and uses adverbs and adjectives?  Well, I literally lost the character sheet.  And today I face and interesting dilemma.  It's been a while since I've played the character.  I have a terrible memory for details.  I can either try to recreate the character or start a new one.
<br><br>
Recreating a character isn't something that I like to do.  I'm never going to feel comfortable that he's the same character.  For some reason there is something about having the original character sheet that helps me identify with the character.  And I'll most certainly lose some of the details, like little notes about other characters and items that I rarely used but that helped define the character by reminding him (and me) where he's been.  I don't care if I get his statistics wrong.  I don't care if he ends up much poorer than he was (and I'm sure he will).  I just don't like that feeling that it's not the same character, that something is missing.
<br><br>
But I also don't want to lose what he could have been.  As the only bard that these monsters have ever met he has gained a reputation.  The tribes call him 'The Spy'.  I'm still not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  They seem to respect him a bit, though.  He earned the name because he was able to help them convince the local Elves to end their war with the tribes.  And he helped negotiate the boundaries and terms of peace between them.  Well, more of a truce than real peace, but still…
<br><br>
Sigh.  Before the game starts tomorrow (today if you're reading this on the day we publish) I have to make this decision, new character or faux-old character.  I guess I'm leaning toward the old character.  I wouldn't want to think that I was wasting my time for all those hours that I've spent playing him…
