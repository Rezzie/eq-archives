Ziff ripped the quiram root from the ground with his knife. He had spent the better part of the day looking for it, and he was pleased with the abundant growth of it here. Quiram was a necessary component for the Charm spell, and if he wanted to practice the new spell, he needed as much quiram as he could find.
<br><br>
If Ziff's three years at the Enchantment College had taught him one thing, it was clearly that spell casting wasn't cheap. The College provided a minimum amount of components for student use, but these were only applicable to the more mundane spells; light, enchant iron, minor illusion. While these spells prepared the student for immediate productivity in the market, they failed to push the learner into the higher, more esoteric realms of study. 
<br><br>
Ziff wanted to learn more complex enchantments, and good teachers were readily available. But reagents were expensive and hard to come by. These he would have to find on his own. Most vendors in Erudin had ample supplies of even the most exotic reagents, but they were universally priced beyond his meager means. 
<br><br>
Ziff leaned back on his heels and looked around. The Toxxulia forest was always dark and misty, a dreary collection of moss covered oaks, pine, and birch trees. He never liked it, preferring the clean streets and alleys of his home city, Erudin. There was some element of danger in the forest, for it was well known that kobolds still lived and roamed the area. However, Ziff had only traveled a mile or so from the city gates, and the city guard occasionally patrolled the region, so the risk was very small.
<br><br>
Ziff stood and stretched. He had gathered nearly a pound of the root, enough for him to test his new Charm spells on some of the student volunteers. He grinned. Maybe he could get the new apprentice to volunteer. By the gods, she was attractive! 
<br><br>
Ziff was just about to stoop to his work again, when a soft rustle made him pause. A small chill shot through him. 
<br><br>
Kobolds! he thought. 
<br><br>
He stood unmoving, waiting. Another rustle, this time closer and louder, accompanied by a strange crackling noise he did not recognize, came from just a few yards to his left. The forest growth here was particularly thick and prevented Ziff from getting a clear view more than four feet in any direction. But as much as it hindered Ziff's view, it also protected him from prying eyes. Whoever or whatever was moving around out there was as unlikely to see Ziff as Ziff was to see it.
<br><br>
Curiosity got the better part of Ziff. 
<br><br>
Probably just a patrol, he thought. Crouching, he eased forward for a better look.
<br><br>
Ziff crawled forward only a dozen yards and was carefully pulling a branch out of his face when a sharp report like boards cracking exploded in his ears. 
<br><br>
Ziff froze. The last sound had come only inches from his face. Carefully, he pulled the last branch from his face.
<br><br>
Standing no more that a foot from his position was a skeleton. Ziff's blood froze and his heart began to hammer in his chest. 
<br><br>
Undead!  he thought. In Toxxulia! ON ERUD! 
<br><br>
Undead had not wandered freely in the forests since the destruction of the Heretics centuries ago. The very presence of this creature, here, now, had thunderous consequences. 
<br><br>
His masters would have marveled at his insightful analysis if any of these thoughts had entered Ziff's mind. Instead, Ziff worked overtime to combat the fear and revulsion coursing through his mind and body while trying not to faint.
<br><br>
He knew he had to get away and report this to the guards, his elders, anybody. With care, Ziff slowly began retreating the way he had come.
<br><br>
Oddly, the monster did not seem to have any set purpose. It stood there, mute and motionless, gazing into some unknown past through its empty sockets. Its stillness relaxed Ziff somewhat helping bring his heart under control. It also lowered his awareness. Ziff slipped on a small log in the underbrush, and, with a gasp, flopped backward onto his rump. 
<br><br>
The skeleton reacted instantly. With a soul shrinking scream, all the more ghastly given it absence of lungs, throat and lips, it leapt at Ziff. Screaming himself, Ziff rolled violently to his right, crashing through the underbrush. His robe ripped and branches stabbed his body as he scrambled to his feet. The monster followed, its stickly body snagging on creepers and growth. 
<br><br>
Ziff was no warrior. His dagger was for chopping roots, and his magical studies were geared more for "practical magic" such as decorative illusions and enchanting farmer's tools. The only dangerous spell he knew was for choking rats. Its value was immeasurable for clearing the warehouse and kitchens of pets. What good it would do him now was anyone's guess, but it was all he had.
<br><br>
"Allikoch" he yelled. Ziff felt the magic rise in him as he strove to impose his will over the magic forces in the world. A slight orange nimbus enshrouded the skeleton, and amazingly, it staggered for just a second. How a lifeless being could be choked briefly broke Ziff's concentration, but he pushed the thought aside for the more urgent imperative of survival. The creature was nearly free of brambles and already reaching for him. The surrounding vegetation was too thick for a quick escape, so the "flight" half of his options was gone.  
<br><br>
"Allikoch" he yelled again, and again the nimbus radiated from the creature. It staggered again, but was still too lively for Ziff's tastes. 
<br><br>
The skeleton ripped free of the brush, staggered to its feet, and swiped at him with its rotten hand. 
<br><br>
"Alli----" The spell died in his throat as the skeleton followed up with another attack, its left hand raking across Ziff's cheek. The sudden pain made him gasp as his face seemed to catch fire. Blindly, he flailed with his right hand and cut off the skeleton's left hand.
<br><br>
A second later, the creature's right hand clubbed him in the temple, and Ziff crumpled to the ground. Nausea threatened to overtake him as he fell roughly to his back.
<br><br>
"Allikoch" he mumbled, and the skeleton fell to one knee, this time making an obscene noise that Ziff took to be gagging. Instantly it was up again, and Ziff knew he was going to die. It was all could do to keep from passing out; exhaustion, fear, and pain all fighting to take him down.
<br><br>
The skeleton loomed over him, a tree branch in its hand. Ziff looked up in detachment as the creature raised the makeshift cudgel. The log came down, and Ziff closed his eyes…
<br><br>
CRACK! 
<br><br>
Ziff felt a weight smash into his stomach, and his eyes jerked open. The skeleton's club lay on the ground, split neatly in two. Half of the club had settled near his legs, the other half had land squarely on his gut
<br><br>
His attacker was being sorely pressed by the arrival of a second skeleton. The creatures exchanged splintering blows but the second monster was clearly stronger, pushing, hitting, and head-butting the first one, driving it back and away from where Ziff lay sprawled.
<br><br>
With a final uppercut, the stronger creature crushed the first skeleton's skull. Destroyed, it collapsed in a pile of splintered bones.
<br><br>
The second skeleton turned and advanced on Ziff. 
<br><br>
"Out of the frying pan…" he mumbled, dizzy and exhausted. The irony of his fate wasn't lost on him, and he gave a slight chuckle.
<br><br>
His laugh stopped as suddenly as it came when the skeleton reached the spot where he lay.  Ziff struggled up to one elbow, holding his dagger up. It was a poor defense, but Ziff was damned if he wasn't going to at least try to go down fighting.
<br><br>
The skeleton just stood there.
<br><br>
"Isn't this where I came in?" Ziff thought.
<br><br>
"Well, what are you waiting for?" he yelled.
<br><br>
The creature didn't budge. It seemed to have forgotten that Ziff was even there. 
<br><br>
Ziff slowly, stiffly, rose to his feet. Dagger in front of him, he challenged the creature again.
<br><br>
"C'mon, you vile puke!" he yelled. "Let's finish it!"
<br><br>
A slight clearing of the throat from behind made Ziff whirl wildly. Standing directly behind him was a man who, but for his filthy brown robe, could have been his twin. Tall and lanky, high of brow like all Erudites, the man gazed casually upon the bruised enchanter, seemingly oblivious to his long dead companion. 
<br><br>
"Please don't call Garavab names, he doesn't like it," said the man.
<br><br>
Ziff fainted.
<br><br>
When Ziff came to, he was resting comfortably on a bed of moss and hides within a primitive hut. His body ached dully, but he was relieved to discover he had not been eaten.
<br><br>
The hut seemed hastily made, the walls a combination of hides, branches, and mud. The roof was thatch with a small hole in the center for venting the smoke from the small fire that burned in the center of the floor. 
<br><br>
His eyes came to rest on the seated figure at the foot of his bed.
<br><br>
"Gorliss?!" he blurted, rising to a sitting position. Wooziness overcame him and he toppled back over.
<br><br>
"I wouldn't do that if I were you," said the seated man. "Besides taking a good beating, you also contracted a disease from your friend in the forest. It took me several hours to drive out the infection, but my methods, while effective, are still a little crude. Your body is bruised inside and out."
<br><br>
"Gorliss…" Ziff breathed. "Gorliss…"
<br><br>
"You keep saying my name," said Gorliss. "Please quit doing that, it's annoying."
<br><br>
"Where have you been for the last 4 years?" asked Ziff. "I came to see you one day, and you were just gone. No one could tell me when or where you had run off to. What are you doing here now? What happened to the skeleton? What…" 
<br><br>
Gorliss held up his hand and cut Ziff short. He stared at Ziff as if from another world, but his voice spoke pleasantly. 
<br><br>
"Do you remember what happened to me five years ago?" asked Gorliss.
<br><br>
Ziff looked away. He knew what Gorliss was referring to, and it was if it had only happened yesterday. 
<br><br>
"Yes. We were returning from the market. You and Irina had gone to buy her a new dress for the wedding."
<br><br>
"What else?" prompted Gorliss.
<br><br>
"A dwarven caravan had arrived from Kalawherever-they-live. One of the drunken fools lost control of his wagon, and the horses bolted. Irina was crushed…"
<br><br>
Ziff could see the tragic scene: the toppled wagon, High Men and dwarves running wildly about, a young enchanter student screaming wildly, and on the ground, a dead, dead body.
<br><br>
Gorliss' eyes burned into Ziff. He winced away from the stare.
<br><br>
"Three days before our wedding," Gorliss spat. "Three days to go, and there she was, dead. And what for? Because some dwarves got drunk? Because some horses were startled? These things happen everyday, and thousands survive. Irina, my Irina, was killed for no reason at all."
<br><br>
Ziff kept his tongue. The intense emotions coming from Gorliss were nearly sufficating.
 <br><br>
"I remember," whispered Ziff.
<br><br>
Ziff thought about the changes that had come over Gorliss following Irina's death. Once one of his closest friends, Gorliss had become a walking spectre, haunted by the tragedy of his lost love. For months he had become withdrawn, listless, uninterested in any thing around him. Then suddenly, about 6 months before his had disappearance, he seemed to have reawakened. He still refused to socialize in any meaningful way, but students who studied with him remarked on his new intensity. His eyes were alight with passion, his movements and walk, determined. His masters at the College, relieved to see one of their best students back in form, privately celebrated his "triumphant" return. Then suddenly, he was gone.
<br><br>
Gorliss had lapsed into silence again, watching his old friend on the bed, but not really seeing him at all, lost in memory. Ziff spoke.
<br><br>
"Why did you leave? I knew you were depressed, but I thought you had come back to yourself."
<br><br>
"I didn't leave," Gorliss said. "I was banished. If I ever return to Erudin, I will be put to death."
<br><br>
Ziff stared wordlessly. He had never heard of such a thing in Erudin. They were a people of laws, of civilization. They were the High Men! Putting people to death was barbaric! And why would they kill Gorliss, once one of the best students in the Enchanter College?
<br><br>
"If you value your skin, you will never tell anyone that you saw me, much less spoke to me. No, don't look that way at me. I will not kill you. The "city fathers" are whom you should fear."
<br><br>
"When Irina was killed, I thought I had lost everything," continued Gorliss. "I only went to the Enchanter College for her. Personally, I always thought of being a magician or a paladin, but she wanted to be an enchanter. I wanted to spend my days close to her, so I followed her into the College. When she died, everything I had tried to be was killed with her. I was nothing. I had no direction, no plans, no future, and no channel for vengeance. I couldn't kill the dwarves, we don't allow such actions. I was wasted and had no answers. But then, something happened, something special…a miracle!"
<br><br>
"I spent most of my days in the library. I wandered the aisles, half-heartedly keeping to my studies, randomly checking out the works of the "great masters." Then one day, I found it! A book. A wondrous book! THE book! It explained everything! The miracle of life, death, and best of all, living beyond death!"
<br><br>
"Knowing what I know now, I can't believe that the book was delivered to me by accident. Those stodgy no-nothings in the Enchanter College would never allow this kind of knowledge to lay around untouched. Elitists! Bigots!"
<br><br>
Gorliss had worked himself up to a near yell, and Ziff grew a little afraid.
 <br><br>
"Regardless," continued Gorliss, calming a little, "I began to learn so much more of life through my new source, I had no choice to experiment." He paused, as if unsure what to say. "Ziff…I brought Irina back to life."
<br><br>
Ziff gasped. No, he thought, he isn't…he can't…
<br><br>
"Not really alive in whole, but animated," said Gorliss, wistfully. "But I had just started. With the book, I could do so much more! The hints, the half written theories, the documented successes! With better equipment and samples…"
<br><br>
Ziff was breathing heavily now…No! no!no!no!pleaseno!no!
<br><br>
"…not just animation, but actual life! Life after death! Just think…"
<br><br>
Don't say it Don't say it dontsayitdontsayitdontsayit
<br><br>
"…can defeat Death! I will be that man!" Gorliss shouted, rising to his feet. "I will not rest, not ever, until I have found You. Until I have put my hands upon Your throat and squeezed! I am coming for you Death, and I will crush you beneath my feet!"
<br><br>
Gorliss was wild now, screaming, his eyes blazing red (red!). A silver nimbus had grown around him, magic tendrils licking out.
<br><br>
Weak as he was, Ziff lurched to his feet and ran. His friend, mad with grief, banished from his own people, had gone insane. He had become the heretic, blasphemer, criminal, traitor, outcast, necromancer.
<br><br>
As he bolted from the hut, Ziff failed to notice the skeletal guard standing calmly outside.
