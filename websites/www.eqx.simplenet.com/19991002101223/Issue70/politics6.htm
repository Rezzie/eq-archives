	South of the Rathe Mountains set into a foreboding wasteland is Oggok, City of Ogres. Bred for war and ultimately the destruction of all Norrath, Ogres are one of the most fearsome races you can play. While they are notoriously stupid, they are unlike their Troll neighbors in that they have a strong militant culture honed in the very likeness of their creator, Rallos Zek. All other life on Norrath are either cattle or enemies to Ogres, and both are there to be eaten. 
<br><br>
	The living machines of destruction continue to serve the purpose they were created for under the leadership of a beatnik group called the GreenBloods. Led by the strongest of the shadow knights and shaman, your first enemies are actually distant relatives to Trolls, the Lizardmen. This conflict will make you a hated foe even in the Troll City, so it is clear very early in your life that you will have few allies other than your brute strength.  
<br><br>
	While Ogres may be far too primitive to have any sort of formal military structure, they have an innate superior cunning in combat. Where their culture develops color and depth is in the difference between the roles the different Ogre professions might have. How does one suppose shaman and shadow knights are chosen from the young? What roles do they play in the conquest of Norrath? This is a unique professional split whereas elsewhere followers of Rallos Zek are exclusively warriors. It is clear to see however that the warriors are not the leaders in Oggok, as one might suspect. 
<br><br>
	One might conclude that shaman are born with "the mark" of a shaman, or chosen by the tribal shaman before them. These Ogres are slightly weaker than their warrior brothers, although not many would argue this difference once the shaman are able to magically enhance their own physical prowess. Shaman, like other races' shaman, would be the primary source of religious and magical power in the culture. Shaman would be counted on to maintain the good standing in the eyes of Rallos Zek, and blamed for any failures and quickly eaten when they fall short of expectations. Because the shadow knights would see them as weaker than a warrior, they would probably be expendable in a routed melee or when in need of food. 
<br><br>
	Shadow knights are somewhat of an odd result of Rallos Zek's rage. No where is made reference of Rallos Zek to the powers of necromancy and the Queen of the Dead, yet the shadow knights are the strongmen at the top of the Greenblood hierarchy. How the shadow knights are chosen from the young could be related to ones bloodlines, or perhaps the strongest young are chosen from a group of thoroughly hazed candidates.  In the Ogre's food chain shadow knights are at the top and all else are held in contempt. 
<br><br>
	A few possible challenges one might face when creating a role for your Ogre could come from a lack of individuality Ogres seem to have. They are big, mean, strong, and dumb and did I mention big? Even with three different professions to break up the monotony, until you are above twentieth level you will still even share the same armor types which doesn't help make anyone appear different. One possible venue to solve this lie in knowing if Ogres really possess any sort of individuality in the first place. How are they named? Do their names mean anything, or are they just adjective sounds? Is your Ogre "different" than the rest of the Ogres, and marches to a different tune, or chose to be agnostic believing Rallos Zek to be dead? Perhaps you were born to be a slave in the Neriak foreign quarters, or perhaps charged to free the slaves. 
<br><br>
	Consider briefly your tolerance of other races that you will meet when you travel. Would you go on an adventure in a dungeon with your dinner before eating it? How would you react to a Barbarian devotee of Rallos Zek who wished to join arms? What are your views on the Dark Elves of Neriak? Are they allies, enemies or just plain too tough to digest to be worth killing? Know that it is not impossible for you to make amends with the guards of the other cities in Norrath, as even the zealous guards of Qeynos will eventually not slay you on first sight if you kill enough Gnolls. Such could be said elsewhere, and you can make allies. There are known pacts between Barbarians and Ogres, and Ogres are in service of several underground multiracial rogue and shadow knight groups. I suppose that it all depends on how much you want to play with your food whether or not you follow the same path as these obviously tolerant Ogre NPCs.
<br><br>
	Remember that as you go forth to smash everything, anyone you encounter could be considered a food item, dead or alive. No matter your motives, the people you meet are no more than talking cows, or possibly angry talking bulls. Your role could be that of a cowboy, or instead that of the ravenous wolf whom has come to kill the sheep. Take advantage of those weaker than you in your conquest, and never be afraid to show a little muscle when dealing with merchants. Last of all, remember what Rallos Zek believes the most, that if you are a true warrior your blood will remain in your veins and not in the soil and grass. Go now and leave no stone standing.
