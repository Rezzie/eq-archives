After an eternity of fevered dreams, Freygar woke to the absence of pain.    He opened his eyes and was greeted by a softly smiling female face.  Waves of brown hair framed a face that would make any man stare, and green eyes searched his, gentle concern not quite hiding a glint of mischief.  The vision turned away, and called out.
<br><br>
"He's awake, Dylay.  Sned a messenger to his Lordship."  Freygar struggled to sit up.
<br><br>
He was in a white marble room, ensconced in a wide bed, and quite naked.  He snatched the blanket up to his waist as the girl turned back to him with a smile.
<br><br>
"We were not sure until you woke that you ever would wake again," she said.  "Your wounds were almost beyond even our abilities."
<br><br>
"You are a Cleric?" Freygar asked.
<br><br>
"Yes.  You are in the Temple of Life.  I am Gera.  Some Rangers brought you in last night.  They were very nearly too late."
<br><br>
"Last night!  My message!" Freygar nearly threw back the covers to rise, then recalled the company he was in.  "Has someone delivered my message to Antonius Bayle?" he asked urgently.
<br><br>
"Have no fear," she reassured him.  "He is most anxious to meet with you."
<br><br>
As if on cue, the door opened briskly to admit two Qeynos guards, who took positions on either side of the doorway.  After them strode an imposing figure in full plate.
<br><br>
Antonius Bayle was in his middle years, a tall man still hard and fit.  Twin wings of grey swept back from his temples, but his gaze was direct and sure.  He and Freygar had not parted under the best of terms the last time they had met, but the leader of Qeynos was known far and wide for being a fair-minded man.  He stared at Freygar now with a decidedly mixed expression.
<br><br>
"Your pardon, m'Lord," murmured Gera, rising and slipping swiftly through the door.
<br><br>
"Please, don't get up," said Bayle, mouth quirking in a smile.  "I hear you have some <em>substantiated</em> rumors for me this time." He took the chair vacated by Gera and pulled it up to the bed.  His mail scraped the wood as he sat.  People said he even wore it to bed.  A military man his whole life, Bayle was uncomfortable with the trappings of his office, and disdained the lavish balls and fashions his wastrel predecessor had favored.  In other circumstances, Freygar was sure he would have liked the man.  As it was...
<br><br>
"My friends are now at the tender mercies of the Gnolls of BlackBurrow, m'Lord," he said, containing his anger.  "They may well have died so that this warning could be brought.  You will forgive me if I am not in a jesting mood."
<br><br>
Bayle's brows lowered, and the guards by the door shifted and glared, but Freygar refused to drop his gaze from the other man's.
<br><br>
"We witnessed a secret meeting between the High Shaman and a Teir'dal Lord.  Aklar, my companion, heard them speak of plans for the takeover of Surefall, and then the conquest of Qeynos itself."
<br><br>
"The Gnolls assault us continually.  We repel them each time.  They are always plotting, good Master Freygar.  What makes this any different?  As for the Dark Elf, I am sure that he was simply a renegade, sheltering with them for a few days."  Freygar opened his mouth to protest.  Bayle lifted a hand and rode right over him.  "I know that you have lost friends, and I am truly sorry, but I cannot authorize an attack on BlackBurrow to rescue a couple of adventurers who got in over their heads."  He rose to his feet.  "My best wishes for a speedy recovery.  The city will cover any costs you incur as a result of your injuries.  We appreciate your attempt to serve the citizens of Qeynos."
<br><br>
Bayle was almost out the door before Freygar could get a word in.
<br><br>
"The Ritual of Azgoreth," he said loudly, and Bayle froze in his tracks.
<br><br>
"What did you say?" he asked, turning slowly.
<br><br>
"My friend, the one you dismiss so lightly.  She overheard the <em>renegade</em> and the High Shaman discuss it.  There was mention of the Avatar, as well, and a plot to kill Mammoth."
<br><br>
Bayle's face grew pale.  Freygar paused, unnerved by the change in the normally unflappable leader.  Bayle looked at him as if seeing the fall of everything he held dear.
<br><br>
"I must consult with... stay here.  I will be back."  He spun on his heel and almost ran from the room, the guards hastening after him.  Freygar gaped at the door.   If <em>Bayle</em> was afraid... Freygar threw off the covers and began to search for his clothes.
<br><br>
"Very nice."  Freygar straightened abruptly from the chest he'd been rummaging through, and spun in alarm.  Gera stood in the door, a small amused smile on her face.  "The door was open."
<br><br>
"What?" he said, and then followed her gaze downward.  He snatched a pillow from the bed and held it in front of him.  "Do you know where my clothes are?" he said, fighting the flush that crept up his face.  Her hand covered a laugh, and she nodded.
<br><br>
"Try in the wardrobe," she nodded toward the tall walnut case in the corner.
<br><br>
"My thanks, lady." He gave her a bow, and his most charming smile.  Her smile grew and she bit her lip in an attempt to keep it under control.
<br><br>
"You are most welcome."  They spent a minute looking at one another before he realized that she wasn't going to leave.
<br><br>
"Much as I would enjoy this game another time," he began.
<br><br>
"There's nothing I haven't seen already," she said, and her laughter bubbled through again.  "Alright, alright!" She lifted her hands.  "I'm leaving."  She gave one last regretful look and then left, shutting the door firmly behind her.  Her giggles trailed down the hall outside.  Freygar shook his head.  Sometimes he found women to be the most exasperating creatures on Norrath.
<br><br>
Fully clothed, he exited the room, shrugging on his pack as he awkwardly bucked his sword belt one handedly.  Gera was waiting a short way down the hall, sitting on a white marble bench.  Everything was white marble, pristine and clinical.  Even Gera's robe was white, although the way it draped her slender form was anything but clinical.  She rose as he approached her, the same amused smile still playing about her full lips.
<br><br>
Clothed, he felt himself a match for her.  Freygar made a perfect leg, and as he straightened, gave her a slow perusal that rivaled the examination he'd received from her.  He was rewarded with a slight flush.
<br><br>
"Would a beautiful lady be so kind as to direct me to the front doors?" he asked.
<br><br>
"I would willingly lead you anywhere..." she began, looking up at him through long dark lashes.  "...were it not for Lord Bayle's express orders that you were not to leave the Temple."
<br><br>
"Lady, please."  He didn't know what he could do to help Anthiel and Aklar, but he was sure that sitting here while Bayle <em>consulted</em> was not going to do them any good.  "It is vital that I leave.  Lord Bayle is not my liege.  He has no right to hold me."
<br><br>
"True," she conceded.  "However, I am his subject, and as free-willed as Qeynos citizens can be, I will not go against his wishes.  Leave the Temple if you can," and the annoying smile built again, " but no one here will aid you."
<br><br>
With a loud grump Freygar set off down the hall past her, her delighted laughter ringing in his ears.  He soon found that she'd spoken nothing but the truth.  Every white-robed person greeted him amiably, asked after his health, and each refused to assist his departure in any way.  Twice... <em>twice</em>! he passed Gera, and both times her laughter chased after him as he stalked by.  The woman was going to drive him mad.
<br><br>
At last, finding himself by a fountain that he had seen three times before, he admitted defeat.  He sat on the stone ledge that surrounded the clear blue water, and resigned himself to waiting for Bayle's return.  He was going to have a few choice words to say about the rights of non-citizens to the man.  The white-clad Clerics nodded pleasantly at him as they passed, unfazed by his glower.  Freygar ground his teeth.
<br><br>
At last a young man came hurrying up to him, bowed, and delivered the message that Lord Bayle requested his presence.   Freygar stared at him with lowered brows until the boy swallowed heavily and began to stammer.  His pride partially assuaged, Freygar followed him.
<br><br>
The boy found the front doors within a few seconds.  Feygar compressed his lips 'til nothing showed but a bloodless white slit.  One glance backward, and his guide sped up until they were nearly running through the streets.  They stopped at the gates to Bayle's manor, and the boy took off without a word.  Freygar raised a fist to pound on the gate, and it swung open.  The aide inside gave a startled look to his hand, and blinked.  
<br><br>
"Master Freygar? If you will follow me?"
<br><br>
The aide admitted him to an inner room, where Bayle sat at the head of a long table.  Every seat was occupied but one, and each by a Guildmaster, their Second, or a Captain of the Qeynos guard.  At Bayle's right hand sat the First Wizard, Gahlith Wrannstad, and on his left...
<br><br>
Te'Anara's eyes were red, and her face weary, but her gaze was direct and strong.  Freygar stared at her for a long minute, remembering Aklar's bitter words about her meeting with this woman.
<br><br>
"If you would be seated, Master Freygar."  Bayle's words broke through his revere, and he found his way to the empty seat, sliding in between Lu'Sun, head Monk, and Belious Naliedin of the Bard Guild.
<br><br>
"My friends," began Bayle, leaning forward and folding his hands on the table.  "This worthy adventurer has brought some very unwelcome news.  I have brought you together that we may all hear it first hand and discuss what is to be done.  Freygar."  He nodded at him to continue.
<br><br>
"I have told all that I know, which is not much," he began, a bit tongue-tied at the august company he sound himself in. "We were not satisfied with reassurances that the change in Gnoll activity meant nothing, so we went to see for ourselves."
<br><br>
"We being who, precisely?" broke in Gahlith.
<br><br>
"Myself, my old friend Anthiel, and Aklar, a Druid of Surefall."  Freygar avoided Te'Anara's eyes.  "We penetrated the Burrow, and discovered the High Shaman meeting with a Dark Elf Lord.  I don't know his name.  Aklar was the one who actually saw them together.  She was not able to tell me all she had heard.  All I know is that their plans include despoiling Surefall and a takeover of Qeynos, as well."
<br><br>
The room broke into startled discussion.  Bayle thumped a mailed fist on the table, and all talk ceased.
<br><br>
"Go on," he said grimly.
<br><br>
"The only real piece of information I have is a name. They were discussing something called the Ritual of Azgoreth."
<br><br>
The Wizard's face went white and still. He bowed his head as though in some private pain or weakness, while Bayle looked at him with a strange mixture of contempt and concern.
<br><br>
"What is this Ritual?" asked Belious, his clever eyes fixing on the Wizard's bent head.  Gahlith drew a deep breath before raising his eyes and meeting his gaze.
<br><br>
"Surefall is a holy place, a sanctuary of Tunare.  Each living being that calls it home carries a part of her spirit within them, but especially blessed are the Great Tree, that being the Druid's Guildhouse," he nodded at  Te'Anara, who seemed lost in thought, hardly listening at all.  "...and Mammoth."  Te'Anara lifted her head at that, eyes abruptly very much present and completely furious.  Gahlith raised a hand as she took in a deep breath.  "I am sorry, Te'Anara.  I realize that I overstep myself.  I do not think that it serves our purpose, however, to keep your allies in the dark about something which our enemies already know."
<br><br>
"Who is this Mammoth?"   Mespha Tevalian, head Enchanter, leaned forward.  "A Druid?" 
<br><br>
Gahlith only looked at Te'Anara.  Her glare slowly faded into resignation and weariness.
<br><br>
"Mammoth is... a living part of Tunare, gift from the Goddess.  Her presence in Surefall is a direct link to with Tunare, much like the Great Tree.  The Great Tree is invulnerable to any attack by weapon or magic, but Mammoth is very mortal.   If she is hurt Tunare herself is wounded. The Great Mother entrusted the Druids and Rangers to safeguard Mammoth, and in return, Surefall is a sanctuary.  If Mammoth were to die... Tunare would withdraw from Surefall.  The Great Tree would die.  We would all be cast out, homeless, for the Glade would become withered and barren without the Tree to sustain it."  Her voice was a whisper by the end, and when she fell silent the room was as still as death.
<br><br>
"The Ritual of Azgoreth."  The Bard finally broke the quiet.
<br><br>
"It is a ritual of Innoruuk," said Gahlith reluctantly.  A chill seemed to pass over the room, as if the Dark God, so named, cast his eye briefly on them.  "It is designed specifically to take advantage of a situation such as Surefall.  When a God or Goddess incarnates a part of him or herself in a mortal being, they become vulnerable.  The Ritual opens the way for a direct assault on Tunare.  When completed, Innoruuk can follow the link to Tunare through the blood of her mortal incarnation.  Tunare will be forced to flee to the body of an Avatar, a follower so close to the Goddess that they can accept the sublimation of their personality and mind by hers.  If the Avatar is then killed... Tunare will die."
<br><br>
"You're saying that a God can die?" demanded Freygar.
<br><br>
"Yes."  Gahlith's eyes were haunted.
<br><br>
"So why hasn't it happened before?  Where has this Ritual been?  And why are the Teir'dal willing to give such power into the hands of the Gnolls, not a particularly loyal or intelligent race?"  The Paladin remained outwardly calm, but his hands were curled into fists before him.
<br><br>
"I don't know why they chose the Gnolls.  Perhaps simply because trusting them was the only way to take Surefall by force.  An army of Innoruuk's Children would never make it this far without causing wars in every country between here and Neriak.  As for the Ritual..." he looked suddenly tired, and aged beyond his years.   "It has been in the keeping of the Wizard's Guild for over 300 years.  Until two weeks ago, when it vanished from the protected vault.  Three Wizards died, and another was Charmed and driven to attack his fellows.  He is hopelessly mad now, locked in a cell in our catacombs.  The book's absence was not discovered until three days ago.  I reported it to Antonius.  We have been unsure of what to do."
<br><br>
"You were <em>keeping</em> it?" the Bard sounded incredulous.
<br><br>
"Why was such an evil not destroyed centuries ago?  I respect your Guild's search for knowledge, First, but to study such a..." Lu'Sun trailed off, unable to find the words to express his disgust.
<br><br>
"To destroy it could have unleashed things beyond our comprehension.  Books of such power have a... kind of sentience.  They are unpredictable.  No one was even allowed in the room where it was kept.  It was warded as strongly as it could have possibly been.  We thought it was safe!"
<br><br>
"Obviously it was not.  And now we must face that reality, not lay blame for how it came to be."  Te'Anara looked around the room.  "How do we stop them?"
<br><br>
Bayle rose to his feet.  "I am prepared to lead the full Guard to Surefall to protect it against the Gnolls' direct assault.  To accomplish this Ritual, they must get to Mammoth.  We will see that they never do.  Your friends, Freygar."  Bayle turned to him with a look of sorrow and compassion.  "I am afraid they are lost to us."
<br><br>
"I know," Freygar drew a hand across his eyes.  "Let me go with you.  I can at least help to protect what they died for."  Bayle nodded and laid a hand on his shoulder briefly.
<br><br>
"I expect a contingent from each one of you," Bayle continued, looking around the room.   "No standing aside this time.  Organize your people and have them at the Gates in three hours.  We march before night falls.  I want to be at Surefall as soon as possible."  The room emptied swiftly.
<br><br>
"Freygar."  Feygar paused at the door as the last of the council went past him. Bayle regarded him.  "I would like you to be at my side.  I may have a task for you.  Will you stand with me?"
<br><br>
The barbarian measured him slowly, and then nodded.  Bayle came forward and gripped his forearm strongly, in the Northern way.  "Good."  Bayle smiled, and Freygar, even in his grief, was comforted by the absolute certainty that was in that smile.
