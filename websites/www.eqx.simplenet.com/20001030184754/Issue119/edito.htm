    Mythology/History spoilers</font></p>

    Ironically, after writing on events, I was almost a witness to one. Tuesday 
    night saw a repeat of the three dragon event heralding the possible dropping 
    of Veeshan’s Veil. I went 3 hours without seeing a single part of the event, 
    and logged off an hour before its conclusion.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    I logged in about 8 or 9 pm EST and began playing Posy, my now level 30 wizard. 
    Chatting with friends and guild members, I heard about some dragons in East 
    Commons. Excited, I drop everything and teleport to West Commons, then zone. 
    Nothing. Shouts arise saying that they are in West Commons - I re-zone. Nothing. 
    Worried for my saftey, though, I levitate, and go invisible so I can get a 
    high perspective on the zone.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Aided by my guildmates, I spent the next 2 hours responding to reports by 
    players teleporting into zones and running, luckily with Spirit of Wolf, to 
    the various locations people reported. I even stooped so low as to use out 
    of game info in that I had a guild member that swore that since the event 
    ended in the Rathe Mountians on one server, it would end there on ours. (It 
    didn’t, it ended in Lavastorm).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    We are on the verge (16 days and counting) of a new chapter in the history 
    of Norrath. Each server, I suppose will be visited by 3 dragons, and following 
    text will be broadcast to all in the zone (or is it server-wide?) </font></p>

  
<blockquote>
  <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>“A faint 
    laughter can be heard upon the rising wind, a husky voice, filled with hatred 
    and disgust.<br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
    voice grows from gentle laughter to a roaring shout,<br>
    "Children of Scale! You shall not succeed this night. I shall make sure of 
    it! For centuries, you have evaded me!"<br>
    "Now, this shall end. Everything that you possess... is but a waste!" <br>
    The voice dies down again, but the wind rages on, swaying the few burned trees 
    which line the firey mountains, their trunks creaking beneath the very force 
    of wind.<br>
    As silence descends, the voice begins to speak again, it's tone filled with 
    mocking endeaderment.<br>
    The voice cries, "Your names, your faces and your very ways shall fade from 
    view. Such a pity it is indeed, that the world shall know my name, and that 
    of your Queen's fall from history and of the Gods and Mortals alike!" <br>
    The shadows quickly retreat back to the corners and stones from which they 
    came, their tendrils rising in the air and the sound of a thousand shrieks 
    echo across the Lavastorm Mountains.<br>
    As the shadows slither away from view, the voice can be heard, faintly hissing 
    foul words.<br>
    "You have evaded me this day, Children of Scale, but it shall not be the last 
    battle which you will face!"<br>
    "Rend your viel and harness your power, it shall do nothing for you, as in 
    the end, you all shall perish, dragon and mortals alike, your corpses shall 
    rot at my feet. For this, I can asure you."<br>
    "Untill that night comes, I bid thee all a good morrow, and watch your back.." 
    The voice trails off into a sadistic laughter that hangs within the air for 
    what seems like an eternity and then eventually fades away into the wind.</font></i>

    The speaker, I believe, is Mayong Mistmoore (who has atrocious spelling for 
    a bard), who has been trying to stop the Ring of Scale from dropping Veeshan’s 
    Veil, which is what keeps the planes and the world of Norrath separate. Another 
    interpretation is that the Veil is what keeps only Veeshan from visiting Norrath. 
    A third, and other likely interpretation is that the Veil is what keeps Kunark 
    and the Iksar, Veeshan’s chosen race, from being seen by the rest of Norrath.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    This sort of sifting through rumors and legends is what I love to see. I am 
    firmly behind Verant’s policy to give conflicting versions of historical/mythological 
    truths. I love the difficulty in trying to balance the different factions: 
    is Mistmoore good or evil? Are the acts of the Ring of Scale designed to bring 
    Veeshan to Norrath? The faction system is great, complex and interconnected 
    like politics.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    I am, however, disappointed in how I found them out - from a news page. I 
    ache to discover these things in Norrath. Some of it is my fault, as I have 
    recently been playing LevelQuest. I haven’t actually done a quest in 2 months. 
    I do hang out in the cities, though, and there are very few npc’s telling 
    news, or boards or signs. (Does anyone know if the message board is still 
    up in the Lion’s Mane in Qeynos? Is it used?)</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    We need more in-game ways of discovering things. One of the ironies of EQ 
    is that the community centers are at camping spots, not in cities. Why go 
    into town nowadays except to bank, or do quests? Experience and treasure, 
    the driving reason behind Level/ItemQuest players, aren’t there. The largest 
    bazaar in Norrath (on my server, at least) is in the East Commons tunnel. 
    We need books, dropped notes, chatty (not spammy) npc’s triggered by the proximity 
    of faction-heavy players, and message boards in the Inns. And mostly, we need 
    these things to <b>matter</b>. Your Norrathian life needs to be changed because 
    of these things.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Did I have fun at the event that I failed to be able to attend? Yes, I did. 
    I was excited and hopeful popping around Norrath sorting out the rumors and 
    trying, desperately, to see one of the mystical dragons. I was frustrated 
    in the end, but the process, the hunt, was very fun. I just hope that these 
    things happen more, and that <b>history</b> will change. The <b>world</b> 
    will change. If it doesn’t <b>matter</b>, it won’t matter.</font></p>
