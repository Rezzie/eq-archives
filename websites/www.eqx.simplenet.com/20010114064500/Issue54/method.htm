The one who called himself Modus stood before his window, troubled. Smoke and Mirrors was his den, his hideout, and his home. The hidden complex sat largely underground, embedded in a large hill in the eastern commonlands. From the low plateau above Freeport, his small band watched, and manipulated, and … liberated. The <em>Unseen</em> were essentially mercenaries under his lead, but they also played the role of continental spies - the reliable purveyors of forbidden information. Secrecy and confidence were their bread and butter. But lately, Modus had noticed the edge of tension in the eyes of even his most trusted emissaries. 
<br><br>
His band was at home in the shadows, thriving on the sprawl of business and conflict. Modus himself was an accomplished thief, a catburglar of unparalleled precision. But the shadows felt somehow <em>wrong</em> to Modus these days… as if they belonged to someone else. His men were uneasy as well - they could all feel it.
<br><br>
The half-elven mercenary stared out of his Dark Window, watching the flickering torchlights of the nearby port city. If a sharp-eyed wood elf stood even a foot away from his viewport outside, he'd have no clue that he was being observed. From the other side, the porthole appeared as solid stone. The Window was a gift from an extraordinarily powerful Erudite woman, above whose head Modus held no small amount of information. The passions of royalty were such dangerous forces… but profitable for the observer.
<br><br>
He shook himself sharply, to free his spine of the creeping chills. He was getting jumpy, that was for certain. The Heroes were stirring, as were the Teir'dal. Even the blasted Gnolls seemed ready for something. And so soon after the undead raid on Qeynos? Strange indeed. Whatever it was, he could only guess at. But the time was certainly ripe for profit, if he could only shake the paranoia. One of his most efficient spies had recently reported that the wizard, Ozymandius, had paid a solo rogue some astronomical amount for a tome. Modus knew that Ozymandius had the means to acquire most any text he had need for --- why the desperation? Why thievery? He knew not.
<br><br>
A sharp knock at his sealed door startled Modus from his reverie. In barely a heartbeat, his rapier was out of its sheath, and his dagger dropped from his sleeve into his waiting palm. 
<br><br>
"None stand within, but for dust and shadows," Modus growled.
<br><br>
"All is as such, except to the careful observer," came the muted reply. Modus breathed out. One of his own, then. His blades sheathed once more, he strode forth and opened the tri-locked oak. Kalsth, his chief thugger. He greeted the swarthy man with his signature smirk, and stepped aside to allow him in. 
<br><br>
"I have made us much profit this day, mast'r Operandi," Kalsth bubbled, in his heavy sea-rat accent.
<br><br>
"Do tell," Modus grinned.
<br><br>
"Sum bleedin' <em>gnolls</em> paid us a lord's chamber in cash, only fer the last whereabouts of a wench, just some Ranger from the outlands, sir!"
<br><br>
Operandi's face grew dark. "Is that so. How much?" he asked, through clenched teeth. 
<br><br>
"Nearly twenty plat-marks, sir. Twenty if it was one!" Kalsth gushed.
<br><br>
Modus turned away from the man. "Twenty marks. A good day's work, that. A good day's work." In a blur of motion, he spun around and backhanded the man across the face, knocking him to the ground. He padded quietly forward, and leaned down to look the man in the eye. "Fool," he hissed, deadly calm, "Do you wish to anger Ozymandius? Have him sniff out Smoke and Mirrors, then turn this place into his own private bonfire? No. I thought not. Dealing with <em>gnolls</em>. I cannot believe even you capable of…" 
<br><br>
"B-but, sir, we only gave 'em a rumor, not exactin' or nothin'…" Kalsth stammered.
<br><br>
"Indeed. Listen carefully. You are to gather ten men, all smarter than you are. Send them on a campaign of misinformation, offering similar deals to the gnolls of Blackburrow and the two Paws. Tell them that the Ranger is being held in Oggok. That will set them off. Maybe we can cause a bit of trouble between the dark ones, and save our own skins," Modus paused, as if lost in thought. As if in an afterthought, he pulled the prone man to his feet, and smiled warmly once more. "And Kalsth… excellent work about the twenty marks." Operandi always kept his men guessing. As his work-name implied, he was all about method.
<br><br>
"Er..er, thankye sir," Kalsth said, still rubbing his jaw and eyeing his leader sidelong. The man left. Modus shut the door behind him, and grimaced. This was definitely not good. The girl, the ranger who called herself Winter. <em>She</em> was the target whom the wizard was trying to protect. And the Dark Elves were likely after her as well. He hoped his attempts at spin control would work. If the Gnolls could be misled into thinking the girl was in Oggok of all places, at least that would buy the heroes time, and keep any attention away from his band.
<br><br>
With a muffled thump, a rolled parchment slid into his spun glass message receptacle, from a tube in the ceiling. The gnomes of Ak'Aknon had designed it for him - through a third party, of course - and it allowed his scouts in the halls above to drop important sightings directly into his office. His brow furrowed, Modus unrolled the scroll and read the scout's quickhand:
<br><br>
<em>THE HALFLING IS HERE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.</em>
<br><br>
Operandi laughed loudly, happy at the news. His friend, the honorable Grimple Dovetree, had come to visit him. In a rush, he set all the wards and illusion-devices to protect his office in his absence, and charged up the spiral stairs, past his dumbfounded guards. 
<br><br>
After passing through the series of camouflaged, archer-guarded outer doors, Modus virtually leapt through the cave entrance to Smoke and Mirrors, bounding along at a maniac's pace. He burst forth into the sunlit forest, and tackled a short, dark-haired form standing outside.
<br><br>
"GRIMPLE! My old and dear friend! How have you been?" Modus rarely let his composure slip, but he had a soft spot for the halfling druid. The pint-sized nature priest had saved his life more than once.
<br><br>
"Erf… listen, get off of me! You tall folk are too damnably heavy," grumbled the green-clad little man. Modus stood quickly, trying desperately to keep his grin from turning into a smirk, to little avail. Modus never could smile straight. "Listen, you half-breed. Ye shouldn't be tackling a druid in his own domain," Grimple growled, making a grandiose gesture at the trees around them.
<br><br>
"Ha! I'll do as I please, halfling. What's the news from Rivervale? Has the wall fallen yet to the goblin threat?" Modus raised an eyebrow, sure that he'd get a rise out of the druid. Halflings were proud of the way they defended their Great Wall against the raiders of clan Runnyeye.
<br><br>
"Ye just be grateful that we don't storm over here and root out your little rat-hole, at my suggestion," the halfling groused. "No, listen. Remember that strange little Teir'dal girl we met outside of the Minotaur maze?"
<br><br>
"Aye, that I do. Pretty, for a darkling."
<br><br>
Grimple frowned. "Well, something is definitely up. She stayed in Rivervale oddly enough, a guest of the nobility. She's gained a bit of acceptance I suppose, she can be quite charming…" He trailed off.
<br><br>
Modus laughed, "Grimp, are you getting soft in your ripe <em>old</em> age?"
<br><br>
"Old?" Grimple roared, "I'll have you know, I'm barely sixty-one, and nae but a pup to Halfling stock. Now <em>listen</em>, you scoundrel. What is it, do you stand around watching and scheming so long, that you cannot help but to babble wildly at the first friendly face you see in weeks?"
<br><br>
Modus remained silent, but smirked all the same.
<br><br>
"Alright then," the druid grunted. "Anyway, that little wisp of a Teir'dal let us in on something quite disturbing. There's a young Dark elf, being trained by one of the mid-level noble houses. He was born with a mark of some kind, and well… they've plans for him. Nae sure exactly what, but they didn't even <em>name</em> him. They call him 'Catalyst', and mumble about him being central to the fall of the surface world. With that crazy bastard Vashaar on the warpath, I figured any bit of extra reconnaissance would be worth spreading."
<br><br>
Operandi's hand strayed absently to the hilt of his black rapier. "That is definitely a noteworthy scrap of news. Ask her for me, will you - ask her to keep an eye on this 'Catalyst', and to continue to keep her sharp ears open when she visits her city from time to time."
<br><br>
Grimple cracked his wide halfling smile. "That I will, my friend. Now, as long as I'm here… there's a pair of those bloody Deathfist Orcs chasing away the younglings nearby. What say we teach them a lesson of fire and steel, for old times' sake?"
<br><br>
Modus cleared his mind of plans and intrigue, allowing his hands the relaxed posture necessary for silent bladework. "Lead on, my short friend. Lead on!"
<br><br>
And so the two set off. But the mercenary's mind was far from quiet. It might become necessary for the Unseen to take a stand in the coming storm, he mused. It might be a question of <em>survival</em>.
