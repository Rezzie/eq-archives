<b>The Penalty Box</b><br><br>

One school of thought would say that if a character should be permitted to continue after death then he or she should be somehow weakened by the experience of rolling snake-eyes in the cosmic game of craps.<br><br>

In some games (again, on paper) characters are able to return, or be resurrected, by virtue of magic, but they lose something that they worked for.  This has traditionally been as simple as being out for the rest of this adventure until a healer can be procured; Sometimes one must lose money, belongings, or both to pay for a resurrection spell, or as a tithe to the Death God.  Certainly death must be a trying experience; Characteristic points, levels of experience, and deterioration of skills can result from either the deterioration of the body before it's resurrection, or from the magics used to pump life into it.<br><br>

Trouble here comes in two forms:  Over-penalizing a character (This can be rectified through beta testing to find a proper balance that is acceptable to all involved);  And the "man that would not die!".  In this last one a character keeps springing back to life and continuing on because death is not much of an obstacle.  He keeps attacking the beast barehanded because eventually he'll get in a lucky shot... on occasion 172, where he manages to blind it with a lucky blow.<br><br>

<b>Servers With a Smile</b><br><br>

 If there are several ongoing games of Everquest occurring on individual servers, then it could be theoretically possible for a character who has died and who wants to continue on in the game, to appear on another of the game servers, where another world is in progress.<br><br>

This results in a loss of continuity, as on Angarr's home world he owns the sword Electron, but here it is owned by someone else.  But nonetheless, Angarr is still able to play.  Also, Angarr's friends are still on the other server.  But then shouldn't death cost something to the player?  If the player has multiple characters, perhaps one of the others can continue on the original server with the player's friends.<br><br>

<hr><br>

Even in a fantasy role-playing game one must expect a certain amount of realism.  I chose this particular subject to write about because of it's potential to impair the continuity of an ongoing game.  As with all new and as yet unexplored technologies there are no easy answers forthcoming.  What I personally would like to see happen is the implementation of the "Appeal" function.  Now let's clarify what I am talking about...<br><br>

Angarr, a high level barbarian, dies because his horse slides down a steep mountain pass taking it's rider with it.  Angarr, having reached zero on whatever statistic keeps track of a person's "life-force" in EQ, click's the APPEAL button.  The last few minutes of transcript are sent to the online Gamemaster, most likely a Sony Representative, who looks at it and says "no harm, no foul" and approves his miraculous resurrection.   By counterpoint...<br><br>

Rancid Wyvernwood picks a fight with a team of adventurers who are after the same treasure as he.  He is promptly slaughtered by the larger group.  He clicks the APPEAL button, the last few minutes of transcript go to the Sony Rep, who deigns "You can come back, but only on another server, as you shouldn't be able to come in contact with the group of people who killed you."</p>
