I love this day.
<br><br>
It's one of those rare occasions where nobody is too busy to come have a drink with me.  I typically like to roll out of bed (or off the floor, out from under the table, out from behind the bar-from wherever it was that I spent the previous night) and peel whatever lovely thing I've spent the evening with from off of me.
<br><br>
There's nothing like the first drink of the morning of the Feast of Innoruuk.  Tradition says that we must drink to him upon first waking.  Priests, shadow knights and other zealots have interpreted this to mean that we must drink the blood of an enemy, meaning you must got forth early in the morning and consecrate a foe to Innoruuk.  Some, such as my guildmate Nuuin have taken it less metaphorically and literally drank the blood of a foe.
<br><br>
I realize that just drinking alcohol would be considered a pleasure, and therefore not a proper show of respect to Innoruuk.  Therefore I have devised a happening that we have come to call "The baptism".
<br><br>
One fine Feast-day, I awoke, took all the bottles of alcohol available that were still open, and poured them into one container then downed the entire thing.  Fishwine, ale, and various other substances do not mix well, as one might guess.  I ducked my head into the nearest bucket and gave up the contents of my stomach.  The act of recall cleared my head a bit.  Over the years we've adapted this to mixing entire bottles of unalike substances into a tub and dunking our heads in for longer than the last guy whose turn it was.
<br><br>
Last feast day I awoke in a room off of the Maiden's Fancy.  It was one of the tiny bedroom areas downstairs.  I might have kept sleeping except for the ogre whore next door who was snoring loud enough to shake the bed in my room.
<br><br>
You can imagine I was startled when I heard the loud snore and felt the bed shake.  I awoke immediately and looked around to make sure I hadn't been so drunk as to sleep with that impure beast.  Fortunately the only company I had was D'Lorka, one of the bar's dancers, who was still sound asleep.  I didn't discover the other dancer, U'golna, until I reached under the bed for my shoes and found her sleeping there, where she had rolled during the night when the bed got crowded.
<br><br>
Anyway, the first order of business was a drink.
<br><br>
I stumbled out into the bar, pulling my pants up over my hips, and sat at the bar, where the bartender was barely awake.  He instinctively poured a drink, almost automatically, as if he were one of those dreadful gnome machinations.
<br><br>
I said, "Boy, what day is it today?"
<br><br>
"Why, it's Feast of Innoruuk day, sir."
<br><br>
"Really," I puzzled, still thinking that perhaps I'd slept or drank my way right through it.  I raised the bottle, "Then these spirits have done it all in one night!"
<br><br>
He seemed confused over that comment but inevitably gave up and settled back into his nearly unconscious state.
<br><br>
"You really want that to be your first drink of THIS day?" said Gainam, who had slunk into the place, as usual undetected by me.  I nearly dropped my drink.
<br><br>
He didn't even give the satisfaction of a smile (also as usual).
<br><br>
"I suppose not," I said, "What sayeth the voice of hate?  Ready for a baptism?
<br><br>
"Yes," said Gainam, "But I would guess from the look of things here that you've run their stock a bit low.  Let's go to the Blind Fish."
<br><br>
I agreed and paid what I usually pay for damages.
<br><br>
"Besides," Gainam said, as if there were no interruption in the discussion, "why frequent a pub that employs the impure breeds?  I mean they still employ Ogres, do they not?  You would do well not to associate with them."
<br><br>
"I don't associate with them," I attempted to defend myself, "I have nothing to do with them.  I'm here because this is where the women are.  The blind fish may as well be called the Cold Fish.  It's rare that any woman in there would open her legs without aid of a cranequin.  Or do you expect a vow of celibacy from me?"  
<br><br>
"I simply expect you zip up and come with me."
<br><br>
So I did, and we left.  Or at least we tried to leave when Gainam couldn't resist turning around and waving a melodramatic hand at those few who were conscious, which means it was pretty much for the bartender's benefit.
<br><br>
"When the time comes and the hand of Innoruuk smites these heathens you best not be standing too close to them."
<br><br>
And with that we were gone.
<br><br>
Already at the Blind Fish were many of the F'leurs DuMal.  They had begun the custom of gathering the open bottles, and they carried them like the heads of fallen foes, parading them high in the air.  The mighty troth had been grabbed from the washroom next door where the bartender's wife washes their clothes.  I doubt they even cleaned it out, simply turning it over to get rid of the clothing.
<br><br>
"Was it washing day?" I asked the barkeep.
<br><br>
"Of course," piped up Gainam, "I had them do their laundry in special anticipation of this event.  I probably winced, because the next thing he said was, "Each moment of pain in life must be purchased… By an even more excruciating moment of pain."
<br><br>
And the mixing commenced.  And as I approached the vat of sundry intoxicants and prepared to duck my head within, I was stopped by a number of people asking if it was really my turn to go first.
<br><br>
"Indeed it is," I said, "As you'll recall, I was in the longest last year, and therefore I go first this year."
<br><br>
They seemed a bit weary of this; Likely because that meant they would have to be under for a long time in order to surpass me.  If someone else went first then perhaps they weren't going to spend the day as wasted as I was about to make them.
<br><br>
And in I went.
<br><br>
I'd like to say that sticking your head into a vat of mixed alcohols is the most amazing and joyous event imaginable, but I would be out and out lying.  To put it simply, it stings.  It stings a lot.  For hours afterwards you are hearing what several participants liken to "the ocean", which is a wide-open mouth hissing sound.  I stayed under for a while, holding my breath for as long as I could, then I began to drink.  I finished and pulled my head out of the tub some time later, rubbing the alcohol from my eyes.
<br><br>
The others stood there.  I heard our timekeeper counting.  He said, "Well, that's longer than last year," which thrilled me to no end.  I sat down rather clumsily and shook the alcohol from my ears.
<br><br>
"Hearing the ocean, dear boy?" asked T'danye.
<br><br>
"No… the brewery," I replied, which garnered a few chuckles.
<br><br>
And so in they went, one after another, until none had a clean head or a eye that wasn't pinched closed from the sting.
<br><br>
"Who won?" asked T'daven
<br><br>
"We're drunk, so I'd say we all won," I replied.
<br><br>
"Ahem!" the timekeeper cleared his throat to get our attention, "Winner this year was Fuerlespit."
<br><br>
"My dear," I said, "Wherever did you learn to hold your breath so long and swallow so much?"
<br><br>
At that point if she could have found her weapon I'm sure this tale would be told by somebody else, or I would be telling it directly to Innoruuk himself.  There would nary be the money to cover the cost of both funerals-one for each half of me.  Fortunately the blade was elusive where it was tucked into her belt in plain sight.  Her drunken, fumbling fingers kept moving right past it.
<br><br>
Fortunately at this point in came Nuuin to interrupt the proceedings.  His eyes were glazed over as if he'd taken the biggest drink of all, only his mouth, chin, and neck were all covered in blood.  It trickled down as far as the spatters on his boots.  In his hand was some unidentifiable fleshy pulp, which he raised to his mouth to finish off.  He chewed a few times and then swallowed.
<br><br>
We all looked at each other.
<br><br>
"Happy Feast day, Nuuin," Said T'daven, "I see you've had your ceremonial drink."
<br><br>
Nuuin looked confused for a moment, but then he always looked a little puzzled when contemplating the nature of the blood on his hands.
<br><br>
"Ah.  Um… yeh… Feast day.  Yeh, ceremony… For feast day…" he mumbled, trailing off until I could make out nothing else he said.
<br><br>
Bremanya leaned into the group of the table, almost lost her balance, then recovered enough to hover there.
<br><br>
"Anyone else get the feeling that he's only celebrating that it's Thursday," She said.
<br><br>
The group at the table laughed.
<br><br>
The rest of what the Feast of Innoruuk is about is only what has come from supposition by many prophets over the years.  They claim that the rest of the day is a feast of pain.  Folks rush headlong into battle, ignoring the odds and the impending harm to themselves.  As they walk through the streets of Neriak, they take the time to hit one another.  Not full-blown fist fights (though that does happen), but a friendly really hard sucker punch.
<br><br>
I recall giving one good punch on my way to the exit of the city, and taking two or three.  My friend Orwin gave me one outrageous kidney punch by popping up out of a barrel and striking me.  When I managed to get off of the ground, I patted him on the back and said, "Good one, you bastard".
<br><br>
Orwin smiled and said, "Having missed this all these years, I didn't realize how much fun you folks have in the city.  This is a great holiday!"
<br><br>
"Come along then," offered Gainam, "We are off to Nektulos to do harm.
<br><br>
I'd give you a description of the rest of the day, but it is all a blur of swinging swords and drunk howls as we stumbled across the forest, disrupting everything we could find, killing every creature we came across, no matter how insignificant.  Often we settled for use of daggers, just to prolong the beast's pain.  It was a divine crusade of antipathy that culminated in the ceremonial 'last meal' just before midnight.
<br><br>
We returned home to discover that the streets of the Third Gate section of Neriak were lined with tables for the Last Meal.  Those weakling Indigo Brotherhood bastards moved the festivities from Neriak Commons because they felt that eating halfling so close to the Foreign Quarter might irritate some of the visitors.  
<br><br>
Normally I love the smell of boiled halfling heads and deep cavern truffles, but by now my head was reeling.  So I popped a few spiced fire beetle eyes into my mouth and settled in for the long night of drinking.
<br><br>
From what I'm told, it was the best celebration to date.  To me it is remembered as I prefer to remember most things: As an enormous blur of sound and fury, pain and pleasure.  I hope this year's festivities will be even more promising.  Happy Feast Day!
