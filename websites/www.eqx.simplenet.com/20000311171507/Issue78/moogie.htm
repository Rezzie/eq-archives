<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
I am a Shadowknight who hides my true identity from those I travel with.  I've grown attached to a female warrior and would like to let her know the true me.  How can I break it to her without turning her off?

Dear Dalvius
<br><br>
Hmm, toughie one.  Moog thinks you should corrupt her slowly before you say what you is.  By then, she be the same as you!  No more problem.  Good way to corrupt is to barsh on head til they dont remember that they be good.

<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
Dear Auntie Moog,  I'm a Halfling, but Halfling ladies don't interest me much.  I do find that I am interested in the larger ladies around Norrath, Especially the Ogres.  I do love them so.  What's a little guy like me to do.  -Little man with big love on his mind.
