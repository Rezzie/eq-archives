Tomorrow begins another campaign.  That means that tonight begins another character.
<br><br>
The trouble with making up first level characters is that they are all fresh.  None of them has any, or much, previous experience.  They can't know anything, they can't have a past.  This can be a dilemma at times.
 <br><br>
This time I wanted to make a character that had, at one time in his life, been a powerful person.  Perhaps a king, a god... something like that.  I then wanted to take away all of that power to make a first level character.  This way I get to have a character with some knowledge, some experience.  Now the campaign is going to take place across planes.  In fact, we were told that we had to create characters that were not from any of our usual campaign worlds.  I didn't want to try to create some arch-magus that had lost his powers.  If I did that then I would also have to make him forget all of his training so as not to unbalance the character with knowledge he should not have.  So that idea was out.
<br><br>
Now I don't usually like to drag high tech characters into fantasy worlds.  I think it's pretty tacky.  But then, I reserve the right to be tacky whenever the urge hits me.  So I figured that I can get away with taking a super hero from some alternate Earth and strip his super powers, leaving him with just a spark.  Then he can try to turn himself into a mage.  I don't have all the details yet.  If I wasn't writing this I would be figuring that out right now...
<br><br>
But I think this is a problem that a lot of us will have when we FINALLY get to make characters for play in Norrath.  Some of us have made dozens, maybe hundreds of brand new characters in our roleplaying history.  It is not easy coming up with something new.  And at times we will want to digress from the standard pattern.  Sometimes we will want to make a superhero and drag him into a fantasy world.  First of all, let me urge you to avoid this for as long as you can.  Transplanted characters, as a general rule, do not help when everyone else is trying to make characters for the world.  I really don't want to be wandering about in Norrath and have someone ask me where the spaceport is.  I am not too interested in the tired old dialogue that occurs when a space man tries to understand a fantasy world.  For some it's still new, for me it's been done, too many times.
<br><br>
But if you still want to make a character that comes from a high tech world, go for it.  Just try to have him adjust quickly.  Roleplay his adjustment, certainly.  But realize that not all folks from the Mars Mining Company are too stupid to accept a fantasy world.  There is no need to make it so that two months after coming to Norrath this well educated, super intelligent person is still asking why nobody has invented the flush toilet.
<br><br>
Hmmm...  Okay, enough of that pet peeve.
<br><br>
As a warning, next week I'll most likely be telling you all about how the game went.  So don't be expecting anything that actually relates to EverQuest...
