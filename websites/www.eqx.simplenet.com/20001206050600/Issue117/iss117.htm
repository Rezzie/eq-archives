<font size="-1">
This guide was designed to introduce you to the rudimentary's of the Barbarian's native tongue.  Like many things in this world climate and society has a grand impact over time not only on our person but on our languages as well.  Despite the Erudin scholar Shietzar's firm assertions that Barbarians are most likely a different race entirely and cannot even remotely be considered cousin to humans, there can be no doubt that their language is firmly rooted in our own Common tongue.

I once met a man who showed me how to live in a land of chaos<br>
Always being fair and kind in judgements of others and deeds<br>
He taught me how to survive in a land of violence and destruction<br>
While being honorable, chivalrous, and wise in the ways of others<br>
He became my hero

Well, we're back.
<br><br>
I have to admit that it was nice having my Friday nights back.  I got to go to Hollywood to see an interesting show put on by the Directors Guild.  They gathered the folks that made Outer Limits together and let them talk to us for a meager $18.

Well, I took a few weeks off EverQuest and EQX.  I had a big run with Posy and sort of hit a rut, taking her from 6th to 28th and then kind of flaming out.  Today I logged in for the first time in ages, and started where I left off, fighting out by the Split Paw Teeth again.  Now, some of my previous friends were a few levels higher than I was, so I couldn't group with them, but I found a group right away and got half a level in about 4 hours.  It was as if I had never left.

<font size="-1">
     I was looking at old issues of EQX, and I ran across a piece of writing by Onnie. It was an article she wrote about Oxessiess (did I spell that right?)<em>[Nobody ever does... - Absor]</em> and things that had changed her character's world, called <a href="../Issue109/heroes.htm">Heroes Passing into Tales</a>. I found it to be a good, almost touching article.
