What specific types of characters are you hoping to attract into your guild?</td>

<td style="text-align: justify">We hope to attract all character classes and races to the guild. We judge characters by their actions and beliefs, not by their race or profession.  Due to our strong belief in honor, we accept any who wish to lead a virtous life, regardless of whether they belong to an innately evil race or class. Suffice it to say, those who follow the path of light shall have a place among us.<br><br></td>

Are you going to accept only PK or only Non-PK characters?
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Zealot:</b></td>
<td style="text-align: justify">Both, for we give our members the freedom to choose whether they want the switch on or off.  We allow pkilling, so long as it is in self defense or for a just cause. More importantly, we promote roleplaying far more than switch setting.

What guild related activities do your members get up to now (pre-beta)?

<td valign="top"><b>Zealot:</b></td>
<td style="text-align: justify">We will host/GM the RPG only channel with the aid of the EQ Vault ops. Um, or is it the other way around? <g> We will have a dice bot as well.  This will allow our members to have some fun roleplaying the old fashioned way and give others the chance to do so until the beta arrives.

Do you have any other pre-beta activities planned for your members?
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Zealot:</b></td>
<td style="text-align: justify">
In addition to the RPG channel, we plan to host the EverQuest Roleplayers Forum, which shall be a message board on the Fraterni Lux homepage.  This shall be open to members and non-members alike who wish to roleplay their characters when posting.  We will also meet regularly on IRC to discuss guild issues or simply have some fun talking to each other.

How many members would make your guild the ideal size?
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Zealot:</b></td>
<td style="text-align: justify">
We do not forsee a limit to the number of members in our guild so long as we can continue to operate as a close democratic family and our commitment to honor does not fail.  We intend to keep on growing in an organized manner and ultimately would like to have more than 60 members total.

Finally, tell us a little about what your guild will get up to in the game.
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Zealot:</b></td>
<td style="text-align: justify"> We would like to have as much fun as possible playing the game and hope to be a guild that is known for its virtue, fellowship, and power across the many worlds.  We will strive to set a chivalrous example for others, explore the world of Norrath, and enjoy ourselves in the process.  By maintaining an active presence in the game and siding with the forces of light, we hope that the Fraterni Lux will be a name feared by all who do evil.</td>
