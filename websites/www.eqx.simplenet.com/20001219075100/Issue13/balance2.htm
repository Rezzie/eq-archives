	<em><big><big>U</big></big>p on top of the new Wizard tower mages gathered for a spectacular event, in which the students and other invited guests would defy death by standing in a roaring wall of fire. One of these young mages had heard about the warriors in the barren field and asked his teacher if the same logic applied to the daily fire wall walking, and the answer was simply, yes. The student then watched as many of his peers were engulfed in flames, even after heavy conditioning with other less lethal spells, and wondered what it all was really worth it. The teacher said "don't worry, as long as they have everything in the bank, it will be ok." The student fainted.</em>

I am not knocking Ultima Online, merely using it in some of my examples, maybe all of them. Play balance is a gray area made up of many black and white issues. Character slots used to do the work of many skilled workers is a contagious thing. The top notch moves up when people circumvent the system, and a divider between legit and slot abusing players evolves. This might be a slot issue. It might be an economics issue. It probably is a mixture of a lot of issues.

In the next paragraph the skills of the locksmith are useless when a mage can do them better, faster and have combat skills to boot. This situation applies to any time a skill is shared by both a specialty class and a core class, such as the one described. 
<br><br>
In the third and fourth we see complex issues of combat balancing, where spawn rates and competition between players leads to sparring to raise melee skills despite the public opinion of sparring (notoriety related maybe, but not a factor necessarily) and casting spells on each other to raise magic resistance to a comfortable range.

Each part of these problems is its own thread, and the end solution to most of these problems is going to come thought ample testing during beta. The root of these problems is usually competition, which is healthy. My dilemma is how can something healthy as competition cause such imbalance? And how much imbalance is healthy? Do we hand feed the newbies or should they be rewarded for the extra sparring? Should they be rewarded for dying on purpose in a fire wall or should the mages who take the time get nothing to show for the efforts? Should a spell list be so limited as to make a mage not a handyman too? Should character slots be counted a valid resources in the economy, or is there another option?

All the heated debates can now be ironed out, all the flame wars fought, all the threads woven and all the posts responded to. The testers can make the difference. Again, I used Ultima Online in my examples even though I do not necessarily feel these issues remain unsolved today. I feel Ultima Online really moved the goal post and I truly believe that the beta test played a part in where the post was pounded in, mostly for the better. Most of these issues were discovered in Ultima Online, or at least exaggerated greatly by the game's success. No matter, I feel that now we have seen these issues we can look for resolution in testing instead of just complaining about them. It is time to move that post again.
