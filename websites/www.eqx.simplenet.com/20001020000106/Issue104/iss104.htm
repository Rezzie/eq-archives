Well, we asked you all to tell us what you liked most about the last two years of EverQuest Express, and you did.  We wanted to be able to point newer readers to the best of EQX.  And it's the readers that know what was best.  Thanks for responding to our poll.  The results were wonderful to read.  You've given us a good sense of what sort of things we did right during our first two years.  And we were very pleased to get all of your comments, despite one's like this:

The task for our staff this week was to come up with a few favorite things from EQX past.  Not an easy bit of work, that's for sure.  The basic idea was to keep it to two or three things that you liked best about EQX, something that you did, something someone else did, and your favorite EQX moment (meaning nearly anything else).  It's one tough job, to find just a few things over the last two years of wonderful goofiness that has gone on here.

I really don't want to write this.  I've been avoiding it all week, and it's now Friday, and I've edited everything I have to, including everyone else's essays, and dang it, I've got to produce.  So, without further ado, or whining on my part, here is "Wut I have to say".

By no means are these easy selections to make.  There are excellent works by the entire crew, past and present.
<br><br>
My Favorite EQX Article: <a href="../Issue42/hail.htm">"HAIL RAZOR! Our Geek Master!"</a>
<br><br>
I selected this work mostly because it exemplified something that I like a great deal about our little periodical as compared to other EverQuest related sites

Anticipating writing this "Best of EQX" article I thought back over the history of EverQuest Express and EverQuest itself. I thought of how the community has grown and changed, of the various fan web sites that started and disappeared, and of the legends I have come to meet in this online world. During this break I tried to remember what it was like before stat modifications, weapon efficiency ratios or class balance petitions.

A long long time ago, in a Realm far far away, err, well it was about a year and little more ago and the world was Norrath, I wrote a silly little poem called "Ode to Cleavage" and happened to read it to a crotchedty old wizard who then said, "Why don't you send this in to EQ Express."  "EQ what?"  was, of course, my response and thus I was introduced to the wonders of an online newspaper written by relatively normal, quite talented people who were fascinated by the imaginal life.

Ohhhh this is a tough one, but if I absolutely have to choose one article I liked best it would be Razor's "<a href="../Issue20/wife.htm">How to Geektify Your Wife 101</a>".  My husband, (yes I am female!  Onnie is a female NAME! &lt;g&gt;), has absolutely no clue about computers and much less interests in computer games.  A good example of his lack of knowledge would be, he thinks I have a talent for them.  Sure I can get around in DOS, but outside of knowing that if I get to do a /del windowtree it's party time, I know very little compared to REAL puter people.

Two years...
<br><br>
Dang!
<br><br>
Well, this is my chance to actually sit back and look at what EverQuest Express has been and what it's done over the last two years.  And I have to be bold and say that I'm impressed.  From what started as a bit of a lark on a newsgroup has become a pretty good little publication.

Greetings everyone,
 <br><br>
I just received an e-mail from some turkey claiming to have made a proggie where you could "switch" between EQ (while running it) and windows. He added the program as an attachment, also claims to be from Norrath...the attachment I scanned and it came out to have the trojan ORIFICE2K the newer version of the now famous back orifice.
