Balin raised his shield to parry the attack of the skeleton's battleaxe.  The blade penetrated his shield at least four inches, missing Balin's hand by a hair.  Balin raised his longsword high in the air, and swung the sword downward, severing the skeletons shoulder.   The skeleton continued to club him with his one fleshless arm.  Balin raised his sword for a second strike, this time detaching its skull from its bony neck.  Balin looked outward to survey the battle.   Across the bloody battlefield lay half his men dying, victims of Nigel's magical army of undead.   The remainder of his men viciously fought off the remainder of the undead.   It looked to him that they had won this battle.  Balin ducked, catching an incoming axe blade out of the corner of his eye.  The blade grazed his ear, allowing him to feel warm blood oozed down the side of his face.  He countered with his sword, shattering the attackers brainless skull.  "Followers of Zek, strike down thy enemy!" he shouted.  "Death to the weak" he raged, as he hunted for his next victim.  
<br><br>
Balin's father had brought his sons up under the rules of Rallos Zek. Three years ago Balin's two brothers left Qeynos in search of their own fate.  He had not heard from them since.  "Strength, courage, but above all, victory is what the heart of a true follower of Zek yearns for.  The heat of battle is the only place where enlightenment can be found. The universe was formed by conflict, and only in conflict will it end. The victors must feast upon the remains of their fallen enemy.  No respect or regard is given to the dead, for if they were worthy their hearts would still pump blood through their veins and not upon the soil of Norrath." His father would say.   "Trust in Zek my sons, and ye sword shall strike true."  Balin was one of three sons by his mother Eidth, and his father Ewing Silthe.  Ewing had been apart of the Qeynos militia since he was twenty years old, and so had his father before him.  At age eighteen Balin took his father's place in the ranks, and after three years of service, earning many awards from fighting many a battle, had become Sargent of the Guard. 
<br><br>
At that moment the scattered clouds in the sky began to converge forming a massive black ominous thundercloud.  Lightning bolts ripped across the sky surrounding the black cloud, followed by low rubbing thunder.  The cloud hovered over the battle scene.  Balin noticed the cloud forming overhead.  As the wind gusts increased, large raindrops began to fall, making it more difficult to see.   As he watched, the cloud seemed to open up at its core.  A gigantic lightning bolt ripped downward, striking one of his men, instantly killing him as he dropped to the ground.  "Take cover men!" Balin screamed.   He quickly scanned for a secure place to weather the storm.  It was then Balin caught sight of a robbed figure standing far atop a distant hill.  He was an older man with long gray hair protruding from his hood.  His arms stretched upwards, as if calling out orders to the cloud.  The cloud followed Balin's men.  "Nigel you bastard.  I will kill you where you stand."  Nigel ignored his threats, continued to concentrate on his spell.  A second bolt of lightning emitted from the cloud.  The bolt found its victim.  The energy from the bolt filled the man as he stretched his arms outward, exploding his fingertips.   He dropped dead to the ground.  Then a third, fourth, and fifth bolt found their targets.  Balin, knew the only way to stop the madness was to kill Nigel, so he charged towards the hill which Nigel stood.  
<br><br>
Nigel was once the King's chemist.  He had served the King for years, taking care of the royal family during illness, curing many a plague that troubled the land.  Nigel was much loved by the people of Antonica, for his magic proved very powerful.  Some say his magic was the more powerful than anyone in Norrath.  The perfect world for Nigel all fell apart with the death of a Queen, the death of the King's Queen.  Pancreas had been ill all winter and nothing Nigel did seemed to have any effect on her condition.  It was almost as if her illness was the spell of another, with magic more powerful than his.   The King raged with anger.  His actions became aberrant towards the end of her life.  He became very erratic and unpredictable.  Nigel feared for his life. Knowing that her death was near he fled the city, finding safe heaven on a small island called Kerra Isle.  The day of her death the King was out-of-his-mind mad with rage.  With his bare hands he killed his entire staff, a day which is still remembered as "The Black King".  The King vowed to kill Nigel.   "I will destroy you Nigel!  I will EAT YOU!"  His screams filled the castle.  The King had posted a reward for Nigel, dead or alive, one thousand pounds of gold.  This had attracted many bounty hunters that searched for Nigel.  Month after month Nigel found himself barely escaping death from another hound.  He was a hunted man.  His life was ruined. 
<br><br>
"You obviously don't know who your dealing with child."  Nigel shouted as Balin came into his view.  "Why I could crush you dead where you stand!"
<br><br>
"You don't scare me old man.  Let your chest feel my sword."  Balin tossed his shield to the ground, and raised his sword.  Like a bull he charged towards Nigel.  Calling upon all his power from within his muscles to perform one symmetrical motion, he brought his sword downward towards Nigel's head.  Nigel raised his hand up as if to block the mighty blow.  "Vow latte froz" He pointed his finger, almost touching the edge of the blade before it split his head in two. 
<br><br>
Balin stood paralyzed in that moment.  He could not move a muscle, not even a blink of his eye.  Totally aware of his situation Balin now feared for his life.   He did discover however that he could still speak.   "Let me go this is no way for a warrior to die!  Fight me like a man.  If you are a man."  Balin said trying not to show his fear.
<br><br>
"You stupid fool.  You're no match for my power.  Look at your men.  They are all dead Balin."
<br><br>
Balin stood frozen and confused.  Why had he not killed me like the rest of my men?  What did this evil serpent have in store for me?  "Why do you not kill me?"
<br><br>
"I want my name cleared.  I did not kill the King's wife.  My life has been ruined because of her death.  That cold man with no heart should have died in her place.  He is the one that is evil.   I bet the Gods did this to him."
<br><br>
"I don't believe you.  Everyone knows you poisoned the queen.  They trusted you Nigel."
<br><br>
"Is that what he told you?"  Nigel gasped.  "I didn't kill Pancreas!  I loved h…", he stopped.  Nigel stood there silent, trying to decide on a suitable message for Balin to deliver to the King.  "You tell him this."  He paused for a short time more and then said, " The hunts on my life will stop.  I am too old for this kind of nonsense, and I'm tired of killing all his men.  You tell him that I'm coming back to face him.  I want my name cleared."  He started to walk away.
<br><br>
"You tell him I'm coming alone." He added.  Then in that moment he disappeared in a cloud of mist.
<br><br>
Balin stood there frozen.  "Hey unfreeze me damnit!"  
<br><br>

The old woman bent forward and placed a small log on the fire under her kettle.  The bones in her back creaked as she bent over to tap the log into place.  She began to stir the contents of the kettle.  A cornea (eyeball) blacks root, lizard's tongue, would occasionally bubble to the surface, and she would stir them back down into the pot.   Her domicile wasn't fit for a sewer rat.  Obviously this old woman never lifted a finger to clean its contents.  Scrolls, books, and an assortment of other parchments, and other spell components littered the cottage.
<br><br>
"Hello mother."  A voice echoed from the corner of the room. 
<br><br>
The woman was startled.  She caught her breath and limped towards the voice.  "Nigel?"
<br><br>
From the darkness appeared a weary looking figure.  His tattered robe hung low over his eyes.  His expression showed no signs of happiness, only sorrow.  "I need your help mother.  I'm going to kill the King and free myself from his curse.  I cant live like this anymore."
<br><br>
Merdith, Nigel's mother, had withheld a dark secret from Nigel.  She never understood how he could serve such a tyrant King, a King who undoubtedly was responsible for her husbands death.  Mar, her husband, and Nigel's father served in the Kings army during the Karithian War.  Mar was very popular with the inhabitants of Antonica, especially its female population.  Mar was a very handsome man.  Often stories were told of his fearless battles.  Mar had a weakness.  He loved beautiful women.  Pancreas, the Queen, had a mystic beauty that Mar found irresistible.  The Queen loved to play jealously pranks with the King.  She enjoyed watching him suffer.  Pancreas would often lead him to believe she was having an affair, and the King would rage with jealously.  Mar was just one of her pawns in this petty game.  Mar was often invited to visit the Queen during the night.  They would sneak off together sometimes the entire night.  Mar would tell her stories about his heroic performances in battle.  The King grew very suspicious of Mar's activities around the castle, and during a small skirmish outside of Qeynos, Mar was reportedly killed by bandits.  At least that's how it was explained to Merdith.  
<br><br>
"Nigel I need to tell you something.  You might not be to happy about it."  Merdith laughed evilly under her breath.  "You remember your feelings for the Queen?"  She paused and then said, "I couldn't let you suffer Nigel.  You were my only son."
<br><br>
Nigel remembered back to the day he was invited by the King to live under the palace roof.  It was the highest honor to sleep less than one hundred yards from such royalty.  Nigel remembered being invited to dinner by the King himself, he was to be an honored guest.  During the meal the Queen made gestures towards him and giggled.  She asked him questions, often making reference of how much he looked like his Father.  Nigel remembered feeling very uncomfortable during that dinner. Later that night he had a visit during the night that would change his life.
<br><br>
He was lying in his bed only half dressed, his chest exposed to the air and relaxing from a very trying day.  Nigel was on the verge of sleep when he caught the glimpse of a figure in the doorway.  The figure moved towards him.  She had long black hair, which she hung in front, below her bosom.  It was the most beautiful woman Nigel had ever seen.   She was a very full figured woman.   Nigel immediately recognized her as Queen Pancreas. 
<br><br>
"Nigel?"
<br><br>
Nigel paused for a brief moment, not able to answer, but eventually was able to gasp the words, "Yes my Queen?" He jumped to the floor and bowed before her.  Pancreas giggled, "Get up you silly boy."  She took a seat at the foot of his bed.
<br><br>
Nigel was in panic.   "BY the Gods!"  he thought to himself.  The King would have my head.
<br><br>
Pancreas placed her hand on the back of his head and began to toy with his hair.  "You look so much like your Father Nigel."  Nigal shivered.  "Don't worry.  The King is asleep.  My you are such an attractive man Nigel."
<br><br>
Nigel blushed and replied, "I don't think you should be here my Queen.  Please."  He paused for a moment, "Please go back to my King.  He would kill me for sure if he knew you were here."
<br><br>
"You let me worry about that."  She said as she leaned forward and kissed him. 
<br><br>
Nigel felt powerless.  His stomach was in knots, but he felt compelled to stay with her, almost like a spell had taken over his body.  He kissed her back.  Nigel met with the Queen several times after that meeting, and eventually found himself falling in love with her.  She was so beautiful.
<br><br>
"Nigel I could not let her do you as she did your Father.  She was evil Nigel, and because of her your Father lost his life."  She stopped talking and lowered her head, then in a low voice she added, "So I took her life."
<br><br>
Nigel looked at his mother.  The room started to spin and Nigel felt he was going to vomit.  "You killed the Queen, mother?"  His sudden attack of nausea changed to rage.  "You are responsible for the illness that took her life?"
<br><br>
"I did it for you my love." She could sense Nigel's rage and suddenly became afraid.
<br><br>
"You ruined my life!"  Nigel could not think of anything further to say.  He feared at that moment he would kill his mother, so barley holding on to sanity he stormed out of his mother's house.
<br><br>
"Nigel!"
<br><br>
He could hear his mother's screams, but ignored them as he walked off.  "Im your mother, and I love you.  Come back here."
<br><br>
"I have no Mother." He thought to himself.  He headed towards Qeynos , to the castle, to face the King.
<br><br>

It was the largest black vulture he'd ever seen sitting atop his shoulder, it had awakened Balin.  Not wasting a second, and in one swift motion, he knocked the bird from its perch, snapping its neck instantly, just as it was about to make a meal of his eyeball.  Balin guessed he had been frozen about a day and a half.  He was thirsty, hungry, and all his muscles cried out in agony.   He took a seat on the ground, he needed a few minutes of stretching before he could walk back to the castle.  It would be a hard two-day trip with little rations. 
<br><br>
He did not believe the words of Nigel.  The Kings words were sacred.  Why would a King need to lie about the death of his Queen?  He was sure Nigel was guilty as charged, and letting him live was all part of some master plan.  Balin never trusted Nigel even when he was the King's chemist, and a town hero.  He had often caught him sneaking around the castle, or with the Queen walking in the gardens.  To be honest he hated Nigel.
<br><br>
Balin finished stretching and after making a quick meal of the bird, buried his dead men, and headed south and out of the Everfrost Peaks.  
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
The mist parted, as Nigel felt the magic leave his body.  He exited the portal.  He was slightly off his mark where he had concentrated on appearing, but only by about an inch.  He possibly smiled, but only for a brief second, pleased with his abilities.  He looked around the confinements he called home for supplies he needed on his quest.  He gathered a pack, which he put a book and a few scrolls.  With supplies loaded, adding some food for the journey, he left his home, probably for the last time.  Nigel didn't care whether he lived or died, but he would clear his name in the faces of the people whom once loved him, and bring an end to an evil King.  Nigel had no idea his mother had passed away during the night, not able to live with the grief she had obviously created for her son.
<br><br>

<br>
With a late start it had taken Balin two days to climb out of the Everfrost Peaks.  It was not easy traveling.  He found the path his men had made, and entered the Jaggedpine forest.  The forest was crowded with thick underbrush, and almost alive with birds of many types.  They seem to all being singing out of sequence and their own love bird song.  The pine trees, which gave it its name, were extremely tall, and almost blocked out all light of day, making a sound proof walk in almost total darkness.  With the nice bed of pine needle it made a comfortable, and cool walk to Qeynos, which was just outside the southern edge of the forest.  
<br><br>
Balin had been walking about an hour, and for the last half of it felt that someone was following him. The eerie feeling of someone watching his every move and in that moment, he was suddenly distracted by an unknown object ahead.  He caught a glimpse of something move behind a large pine. 
<br><br>
"Come out, and in my sight, to be seen and recognized by order of the King." Balin ordered.  "I am armed and will easily defeat you." He added.
<br><br>
A voice sounding more like the hiss of a snake than of a human voice, emitting from behind the pine, "You couldn't defeat a prairie dog let alone me Balin." The mystery figure hissed, and moved from behind the tree laughing evilly.
<br><br>
There were two things Balin found odd about his stalker.  First, it had no feet, and second, it seemed to be floating in mid air.  Balin gasped.  "Who?" he paused, "No WHAT are you?" He gasped and added.  "And how to you know me?"
<br><br>
"I know everything about you Balin, Sargent of the Guard, goodie two shoes.  I know who you are, and your not going to kill my son.  You're going to save him." The ghost of Merdith said.
<br><br>
"Like hell I am.  He is a dead man!" Balin growled, now getting angry.  "The King has ordered him dead, and I'm going to honor that order."
<br><br>
"Blah the King.  The King is a fool, and speaks nothing but lies.  I would think you to know better than judge my son like that.  Besides Balin, you're going to want to do this for me."  Merdith said, as she began to concentrate on Balin's mind.  She called the powers from within her body.  Balin felt his body getting numb, and the forest and Merdith faded from his view.  "What… What's happ-en-in…"  Before he could finish the sentence he was deep asleep.
