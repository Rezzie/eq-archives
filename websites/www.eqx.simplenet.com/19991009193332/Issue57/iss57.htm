Jythri walked along the lanes of Freeport, surrounded by his adoring fans.  He smiled down at them as they walked alongside him, waving their coppers and clamoring for a story.  This was the part of his vocation he enjoyed the most.

  Aklar left Surefall Glade in a state of shock and sorrow.  Lost in her private misery, she failed to see the concerned looks of her fellow Druids, or those of the Rangers who shared the sanctuary.  She went past Ran Walker at the tunnel entrance without hearing him call after her, his duty alone preventing him from running after her.  She went into the gloom of the tunnel and knew its darkness to be nothing compared to the shadow hanging over her heart.

	Here I am again, burning this image into my eyes like an old rear-projection TV. Twelve races, 14 possible classes, dozens of different faces. Staring at this screen I begin to daydream, and begin to slip into the duality that exists in most of us like some sort of RPG-centric schizophrenia. The powergamer Ian and the role player Ian begin to separate and exchange debate.

Oh foggy night, the moon was barely shining, and in the wood you could hear the kobolds howl.<br>
Alone in the woods, two adventurers wander, and in the heart of one was a crime most foul.<br>
Etar...   oh Etar....  Why did you slay my humble soul?...   Etar..  oh Etar, That which you stole shall 
forever condemn you noooow!

	The young bard cautiously walked up to the tavern door.  He had been there before, but the last time he was there he had run into an old "friend" who he wished to avoid.  He was thirsty, however, so he chanced coming to the tavern once again.  Quietly, he peeked inside.  "No sign of him," he thought.  "It's safe."

I awoke with a start, forgetting for a moment where I was. I rubbed my bleary eyes and stared blankly at the dank room that seemed to be crushing me. I gasped before I could stop myself at the huge giant of an ogre staring at me from across the room adorned in thick and heavy plates. He remained still and silent, but those impassive eyes bore into me nonetheless.

I just opened my copy of Free Agent (ImaCheapBastage) and peeked into the newsgroups.  <b>Have you all gone mad?</b>  I mean, sure, you've had some bad news.  But do we really need three hundred posts in complaint on each topic?  I think not.

To Whom It May Concern:
 <br><br>
I was very disappointed to see that there was no rumors sections in Issue 56.  This has quickly become my favorite part of EQX.  I do also enjoy the Traveller's Tales and the new Ohaobol's Trophy though.  But I hope to see another rumor's section in Issue 57.</em>

<em>Hi,
<br><br>
I am on for the phase 4 Beta and I'm just wondering if any of you aficionados out there know if there's going to be equal opportunities as regarding Fighters and more docile chars like Clerics and Druids etc
Will ones "XP" rise when healing and such or do even hardened Pacifists have to jump the slaughter-wagon to advance levels?
