	It was a calm, misty morning as I walked out of the Sleepy Willow Inn. A slow breeze whistled through the trees above me, as it began to slowly rain. Somewhere up above the forest the sun tried to penetrate the haze. I double-checked my supplies. I had enough food, water, and gold. I was rested. I breathed in the cool, damp air and walked to the lift that would lead me down from the Elf Tree City of Kelethin.
<br><br>
	Everyday since I quit my bodyguard contract two months ago had been the same - wake up early, eat, kill Orcs, and spend the nights drinking in the tavern. I'd kill as many Orcs as I could, sometimes spending the whole night hunting them down, sometimes waking from a drunken stupor in the forest. But today was different!
<br><br>
	When I was younger I had the choice of being a magic user or a warrior. The elders in the city knew I had the mental capacity for spells, but I didn't have the patience. I was much more comfortable using a sword - I got immediate results with a sword. There was no second-guessing, I knew exactly what I was capable of.
<br><br>
	I had excelled quickly as a warrior, and while my friends who I had trained with set out to find their destinies I stayed in Kelethin. Not because I didn't have an adventurous spirit, but because I knew my destiny!
<br><br>
	Her name is Ganieda, the most beautiful and noble High Elf I have ever seen. She is almost six feet tall, slender, with long brown hair, and big sparkling brown eyes. I first got a glimpse of her on a training exercise. My friends and I had traveled to Felwithe, the High Elf City, to buy some armor before setting out to train in the forest.
<br><br>
	I had only been in Felwithe a few times, and I really wasn't comfortable there. I always felt looked down upon by the High Elves I met. They had fine clothes, I had simple clothes; they had a beautiful city built of stone, I lived in a wooden city in the trees; the High Elves were graceful in everything they did. In all honesty, I held no ill feelings towards them. I was awed by them, and I respected them - from a distance.
<br><br>
	Some would say I was in the right place at the right time, I say it was fate. Ganieda came up to me! She had apparently heard that some Tree Elf Warriors were in the city, and she was curious. She asked me about a million questions - about Kelethin, the Orcs, my sword, and more than I can remember. When I think back to our first meeting I don't remember anything, really, except her beautiful face, and the sound of her sweet, sweet voice.
<br><br>
	Ganieda took me on a tour of Felwithe that day. We spent the whole day walking and talking, I didn't even think once about my friends who by then had probably went out to train. When night came Ganieda and I parted ways, but not before she made me promise to come back soon to visit her. I traveled the short distance from Felwithe to Kelethin in a daze. Once in Kelethin I went straight to my trainer, and informed him that I was no longer going to be a part of the warriors guild. I then set out to hire my services as a bodyguard to merchants in Felwithe who travel between cities. This really wasn't as drastic as it seems; many warriors before me had hired out their services to merchants.
<br><br>
	Though the distance between Kelethin and Felwithe is short there are legitimate dangers such as giant wasps, bats, skeletons, the occasional roaming Orc, and most likely of all, bandits. I tried to get hired on to merchants who weren't traveling far, so I could get back to Ganieda sooner, but occasionally I had to take longer trips to the Dwarf City of Kaladim. Time went by on these trips, because of my thoughts of the welcome home that would surely come in Ganieda's arms!
<br><br>
	Ganieda's parents were well known in Felwithe. They were somehow involved in the cities politics. How exactly, I didn't know, I didn't much care. My only concern was that they approved of Ganieda and I. Which, at first, they didn't. I suppose it's hard for any parent to approve of their daughter's love for a man. No matter what he won't be worthy. After six months of me spending time with her parents they finally consented to our marriage.
<br><br>
	Marriage! I knew Ganieda and I were meant to be together. I'm not sure who first thought of the idea - I think it came naturally. We were walking through Felwithe in the evening when we first talked about it. Around us the city died down, merchant's closed shop, adventurers came in to spend the night in the Inns and Taverns. That night we stayed up all night planning our wedding, and trying to figure out how to convince her parents. I think it was my natural charm that one them over, I don't know. All I know is they agreed!
<br><br>
	The night before our wedding I went to Kelethin early to locate some of my friends whom I had grown up with. I was supposed to come back to escort Ganieda's family to Kelethin, but I got caught up in memories of old times with my friends. When I realized I was late, I ran to the nearest lift. I went down the path towards Felwithe, hoping they hadn't left yet - so I could escort them to my city!
<br><br>
	The trail went over a hill ahead of me. I began to smell smoke, and began running faster, my heart pounding loudly. When I reached the top of the hill I could see flames below on both sides of the trail. I can't remember how I got down there so quick, all I remember is finding myself surrounded by smoke and the heat of the flames. It looked that whoever these people had been, they had been attacked by Orcs. There were tracks everywhere! But that made no sense - Orcs were never out in these parts of the forest. Sure, occasionally one or two would wander out here, but judging by the prints, there were more than two.
<br><br>
	I found a few charred bodies, and then I heard a moan. I ran to the base of the tree where the sound had come from. One of the charred bodies was alive. I bent down, and only then did I realize that it was Ganiedas Father. I cautiously bent closer to him, he looked at me with tears in eyes, and said 'They took Ganieda', and died. I jumped, and searched, but I couldn't find any clues as to which direction the Orcs had gone. I assumed they had taken her to the Orcs Cave called Crushbone. I ran that way, leaving the charred bodies among the fires, letting others take care of them.
<br><br>
	So, during the past two months I've been trying to find her. Every Orc I come across - whether they answer my questions or not - I slaughter. I drown out the horror of my thoughts with alcohol at night. I didn't want to, I couldn't think about what they might have done to her. It was simpler to be consumed by the battle fury, and the alcohol. I never drank much before, and had no tolerance for it, which made it all the easier to use it to escape from my thoughts.
<br><br>
	As I had said before, the last two months had been exactly the same. I had found no sign of Ganieda. After her being in Crushbone for two months, I don't think I could handle finding what was left of her. By now I had accepted that Ganieda was gone forever. The only purpose I had left in my life was to avenge her!
<br><br>
	I don't know why I went back to the trail where she was abducted and her parents killed, but I did. It was eerily quiet. New grass had begun to grow where the fired had burned, a slow rain steadily fell - hiding my tears. I missed her. As I slowly made my way around the area, I kicked at the dirt, oblivious to my surroundings, thinking of her. As I was kicking the dirt I uncovered a piece of cloth. I bent down to inspect it, and noticed that it was burnt around the edges. It was only about four inches wide. I had never seen such cloth before.
<br><br>
	I spent a little more time remembering Ganieda before heading back to Kelethin. When I got back, before I went to the Tavern, I went to the Merchant Kwein to ask about the cloth. Kwein informed me that it was cloth that Dark Elves preferred. A Dark Elf - near Kelethin! My heart leaped, maybe... I dared not hope, but what else could I do. Maybe, for some reason, a Dark Elf kidnapped Ganieda. But a Dark Elf working with Orcs? It made no sense. I had never heard of such a thing, but these days anything was possible. Maybe Ganieda was alive!
<br><br>
	That was two days ago. I've spent the last two days sobering up, and getting my supplies together. All of this passes through my mind as I ride the lift down to the forest floor. I can smell the damp earth and the rain as I step off the lift, and it refreshes me. It dawns on me that I am like the rest of the warriors after all. I set out to find my destiny, my first love, my Ganieda.
