Hoi there! Lrets D'pearl here with the latest an' greatest in news across the lands of Norrath. Actually today's bit is more of a public service announcement and a warning to all ye adventurers out there in the Oasis of Marr. Yeesh! Dark rumors of a nation of lizard people have been floating around in local taverns and inns lately an' it has quite a few people jittery. Nobody knows if'n these creatures plan on invading an' attacking us or what ... so as ye'd expect the many tribes of Norrath are gearing up an' developing the latest an' greatest weapons technology in the lands. So for the next couple o' weeks I will do a showcase on the incredible strides in weapons technology that are being made.
<br><br>
Me first stop takes me to the exotic desert Oasis of Marr, where the Aqua Gob's have developed a truly devastating weapon of staggering power. Yeesh! This doozy puts the <a href="../Issue69/fit.htm">Qeynos Rat Catapult</a> to shame. A tentative name for this weapon has been given: The Flatulatorbombe.

<em>The latest an' greatest in Aqua Gob weapon technology gives new meaning to the phrase "Silent but Deadly"</em></center>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Apparently, Aqua Gob alchemists have come up with a potion that allows the imbiber to blast his enemies with a Deadly Gas Cloud spell. This potion operates by starting a magical chemical reaction deep within the bowels of the potion drinker which causes the drinker to release, what Aqua Gob technicians refer to as an ... "Amorphous, etheric, flatulatory, mist convergence." If'n ye ask me ... I'd just call it a nasty ol' fart cloud ... but I've never really had a way with words anyways :) In any case! The released gas causes a most painful and hideous death to any poor victims caught within the area of the cloud.

<em>WARNING!!!! WARNING!!! To all adventurers in the Oasis of Marr! DO NOT... I repeat... DO NOT approach any pulsating yellow an' green clouds that ye see roiling across the sands of the desert or ye'll meet with a most hideous an' untimely death ... as these poor souls can attest to.</em></center>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Which brings me to the warning portion of me article. If'n ye happen to be in the Oasis of Marr an' ye happen to catch a glimpse of a green an' yellow pulsating cloud on the horizon ... DO NOT approach it! It seems the Aqua Gobs, being in need of test subjects for their new weapon, failed to disclose the fact that they'd be testing this weapon in the desert. Yeesh!!!

<em>Yeesh!!! The places I have tae go to get ye folks a scoop .. blech! But what's the big deal with this thing anyways.. I can get the same results just from eating a can o' Oxesiess' famous Barbie BlackBurrow Beandip!</em></center>
<p style="text-align: justify">
The Deathfist Orcs are preparing a weapon of their own ... but don't ye worry I'll be there to nab the scoop for ye next week! So ... this is Lrets D'pearl, Aspiring Bard Extraordinaire an' lookin' around for a good ant-acid spell to EQ Express over to those Aqua Gobs in Marr ... signing off till next week!
