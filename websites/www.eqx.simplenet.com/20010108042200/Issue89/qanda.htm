<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any suggestions on where a humble Dark Elf like myself might take a nice Teir'dal lady on a date? I'd prefer somewhere in which my lady won't be eaten by goblins, orcs or lions, and a place with a nice view, preferably somewhere with a nice overlook of an area...in which humans might hunt animals that are much, much stronger than them...&lt;cough&gt; Please give me some suggestions for a date? :)
<br>Eliptus
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my, this kind of question is definitely one that interests me although I wasn't aware that Dark Elves observed the more genteel mating rituals such as dates.  (I'm always glad to learn these things  --- strictly as anthropological lore information obviously.)   I have continued to research such matters and have come up with a couple of possibilities.  The first suggestion is for the dark rainy cold nights when Dark Elf females might freeze in the outdoors.  For those times, I understand there is a charming bar in Neriak Commons with dark corners near subterranean windows where you can observe a halfling perpetually swimming.  While I can't promise you privacy (and suggest that you coo to each other in groupsay or tells), it is a safe and cozy nook.  To round out the evening, you might then invite your date behind the waterfall also in Neriak Commons for a wee bit of private conversation (again avoiding "say" or the public channels for fear of embarassment).  For when the moon rises over warm and balmy  evenings, however, you might try a picnic by the cliffs near the fishing village in North Ro overlooking the sea as they seem to be relatively undisturbed.  A friend suggested that I send you off to skinnydip in the lake in West Commons.  It is a beautiful spot indeed but as my elven friend has little interest in preserving indigo skins from piranhas, I think I will not seriously propose that you take your lady friend there.  Finally, for that special weekend getaway, perhaps you might consider the wonders of Lake Rathe.  A small boat, countless private bays and soft grassy spots will enhance your enjoyment of your companion.  A word of caution, however, you might wish to scope out the environment with an adventuring party first as the area does have its natural dangers.  At any rate, may romance always travel the road with you!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've seen screen shots of the different deities, but have never actually seen the gods ingame. Where can they be found?
<br>Lachrey
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumors float like clouds at sunset over East Commons and the ones I happen to have blow by me said something to the effect that perhaps the deities occupy the Planes.  Other, less reliable rumors have wisped by me that mortals have invaded the Planes of late.   It's quite a mystery.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the use of a quiver to keep your arrows in ? As far as I can tell there's no difference in capacity between the quiver and a small bag. I was hoping the quiver could be placed in the ammunition slot in my inventory, but alas..Your thoughts on this please :-)
<br>Parami
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm,  I wish I could say a quiver gave you style points but since quivers in inventories aren't usually seen, they don't even give that.  It is true that quivers cannot be placed in the ammunition slot and in fact really have little use.   The quiver is distinctive in looks, however, so perhaps you might choose to use it to keep special items accessible.  That way you won't need to spend precious time rifling through umpteen backpacks to find the engagement ring you have been saving for your special someone.  (I believe I'm still working on the dating question above.)
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am playing an enchanter, and I can't seem to be able to give commands to my pet... I have tried many ways to make the pet attack ( /pet attack ), and it doesn't seem to work, is there something different about the enchanter's pet? The pet seems to be in "guard me" mode, he follows and defends, but I can't make it attack anything ( even greenies). BTW, I created a necro, just to compare, and I have no difficulties controlling it!
<br>Anidaara
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of my oft-referred to cleric friends so succinctly stated, "Enchanter pets are stupid and will only assist when the enchanter is attacked."  Of course I wouldn't normally use such straightforward language as bardly skills tend more toward elaboration, but in this case, I can only agree.  However, he did go on to say that if enchanters had more intelligent pets, the enchanter power would be "insane" and unbalance the game, so it seems there is a reason behind the limited pet abilities.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that if I die at the hand of something near my level (A crocodile, for example), I lose more experience than when I die at the hands of something many levels above me, like a Sand Giant.  Am I just imagining this, or is it true?
<br>Agom
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know about your experience bubbles but mine do peculiar little dances and generally don't reveal accurately measurable changes each time I die.   I did check with some group members and asked if they had experienced similar differences in experience loss to yours and the general consensus seemed to be that you may not be imagining this at all.  I considered the possibility of allowing an ice giant to finish stomping and squishing me to compare experience loss to that I received from goblins, but chickened out at the last moment and ran for my life so, as of now, scientific method remains to be applied.  If anyone does know on this for sure, I'd love to hear from you.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;G'day I was just wanting to get an answer on an issue that has caused strife in my circle of eq friends :). What I want to know is whether I could still be killed by DE's or other evils if I had cast illusion: DE on my self or if I was wearing a guise of the deceivers? Someone has said that the mask and illusion spells turn you indifferent to the DE NPCS.... Is this true or would I be like a DE that has killed too many guards? Please clear this up if you can.
<br>Thanks Qaelan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to run a few miles alongside a fastmoving gnome and received this answer to your question to pass along to you.  Basically, illusions will only change your race, they will not affect your factions or your religion.  In your example, an agnostic in the form of a DE would be accepted but followers of Tunare in the same guise would be slain.  However, if the agnostic killed too many guards and destroyed his faction, he too would be slain.  I hope this helps.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What does it matter when the swim skill goes up?  Does it increase how long you can stay under water, or how fast you swim? Perhaps it uses less stamina?  I dunno... that's why I'm asking you. *grin*
<br>Enlay, monk.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding of the swim skill is that as you raise in the skill you can swim faster, thus covering longer distances with the same amount of air and stamina.  From what people have told me, I don't think increased skill would allow you to stay under water longer though.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;While hunting in Eastern Karanas, my partner and I had just come out of a large battle. She was down to 2bbls of health. She was suddenly attacked by a Woodelf that was charmed. Even tho I knew he was charmed,I couldn't allow him to kill her, so I had to kill him. I felt terrible, but felt I had no choice. Was I wrong to do this?
<br>Jaycar
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that you had the right motives and in desperation, killing the wood elf acting under the dastardly influence of a meanie npc, was the right thing to do.  However, depending on your class and skills, I'd like to suggest that you try to use your skills and abilities as creatively as possible.   For instance, if you are a healer you could heal your partner enough so both of you could run off, with perhaps the wood elf chasing you until his charm had worn off and he could come to his senses.   Then you would have saved both your partner and the wood elf.  However, said creative solutions are not always possible, sadly enough, and in any case the wood elf might have ended up dead anyway at the hands of his charmer.  So, all in all, it would have been cool to see if you could save both, but if the odds were against it, you did the right thing in saving your partner.  Now, sweet dreams and I'm sure the woodelf will forgive you over a glass of good elven spirits.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What are all the known languages throughout the lands of Norrath?
<br>RissaBard of Freeport
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can thank the bards Creediki and Elorin for the following list and if anyone finds a language that is missing, please let me know:  One language for each race, common, thieves cant, giant, gnoll, orc, faerie, froglok, goblin, lizardman, dark speak, dragon, elder dragon, elder erudite, elder tier-dal, elder elvish, and old combine empire.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you make pies?  I have tried the meat pie recipe, and the berry pie recipe, with no luck.  I have even tried using more clumps of dough on the meat pie recipe, with no success.  I had a friend that successfully made Firebeetle Eye Pie, but I haven't seen him in awhile, so I cannot ask him how he did it.  If you have the answer, please give it to me.
<br>Silversight
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I found a cute gnome with purple stains on his moustache to ask about pie baking and he told me that the recipes were all somewhat similar.  For instance, if you wish to make rat ear pie, you will need dough, rat ears, spices, a pie tin and an oven.  However, it is possible that not all the recipes work correctly, so if you are following the recipe book exactly and still do not end up with a pie, you might want to petition to ask if the recipe is broken or bugged.  The gnome, quite the connoisseur of pies, said that as far as he knew, there are beetle pies, fruit pies (foraged fruit), berry pies, rat ear pie, vegetable pie and meat pie.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom is said to affect a caster's 'fizzles', does it have a similar effect on a Bard's 'missed notes'?
<br><br>
It would be helpful to be able to view all of one's Faction Standings, whether in numerical, or graphical form.  Even if there were no 'scales' involved, just having a record of Who likes and dislikes you would help.  How about an explanation of the Order in which the /con ratings go?  Is 'amiably' better, or worse than 'warmly'?  How about 'apprehensively', is that better, or worse than 'indifferently'?  What range of responses translates to 'KOS'?
<br><br>
How about a method, whether through simple game-playing, or a Quest, or both, whereby one could 'convert' to another 'religion'?
<br><br>
What real effect does 'religion' have on the game?  Is it just a Faction thing?  Do one's actions affect how one's God feels?
<br><br>
The Stamina attribute affects initial Hit Points and presumably has similar influence on those gained in successive levels.  However, certain Stamina 'scores' have no additional effect on starting Hit Points, beyond fitting within a certain range.  Do they have an appreciable effect on these gains, or just continue to fill out the range?
<br><br>
What about being able to view the character (the Persona Screen would be fine) Without entering Norrath?  It would be nice to be able to print out the character (stats, equipment, etc.), other than by taking a screen-shot.
<br>Clarion, Wood Elf Bard.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whew boy, do you have a lot of questions.  I will try to address them briefly and hope it helps.  First, wisdom apparently has little effect on bard songs.  Since dexterity is one of the highlighted stat areas of bard songs, my guess is that it has a lot to do with song misses.  It's also possible that intelligence might affect it, but that's totally a guess.    On faction standings, I haven't heard that that information would ever be available.  I think it might make sense to keep a personal record, especially now that we can log our play sessions.  I didn't have time to make a "con" list but oh I would love to have one too.  If anyone out there does have a list, would you send it to me and we'll make it available.  I know that if I don't read carefully on the con, I'll find myself in deep trouble with some blue npc's I thought were doable.  Now, the religious conversion question --- I remember hearing Aradune say way way back in beta that someday there might possibly be very difficult quests by which a player could change religions but they would be extremely hard and the deities might react unpredictably.   I haven't heard of any immediate plans for such quests however and am merely repeating a very old story because it still seems like a great idea.  Mostly, the religion issues seem to be in development although as stated above on the illusion question, they do relate directly to your standings with npc's.  It'll be interesting to see if the gods do become affected by the practices of their religious followers.  The Stamina question I have no clue on.  That one hereby opened up to an answer if anyone has one.  Finally, I assume you mean it would be cool if there were a folder in your EQ file with the image of your character that you could access without logging onto EQ?  I like the idea too if its possible and suggest you write to </FONT><A HREF="mailto:eqfeedback@verant.com"><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2>eqfeedback@verant.com</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style,Times New Roman"> or petition and ask a guide to add your suggestion to the feedback file.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more of a response to a popular question.  I petitioned today on the Veeshan server asking if not looting a monster slows down a spawn.  The GM said 'That rumor is False'.  Just to clear that up for everyone.
<br>Aalon
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for sending in that information.  That is exactly what I have been told on numerous occasions.  However, to go along with that, sometimes players will notice that a certain npcs are not wandering around in their usual numbers.  It is possible for npcs to get caught out of the geometry (under the world for instance) so that the spawn seems to have slowed down.  If you should happen to notice the spawn seems unusually absent, i.e., perhaps there are hardly any giants tromping over the commons' hills, you might petition and ask a guide to check to see if the giants are stuck away from their normal spawn and pathways.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the question about hide and sneak for druids  they are locked at 30 and will not increase after that. Also tracking for druids is locked at 20. Maybe Verant will change this in the future.  Hope this helps.
<br>Mcduff Frostwind
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question as much as a little info on this -- question on halfling druids and their hiding and sneaking abilities.  Actually only the rogue has the actual SKILL of hide sneak. All others DE included have an innate ability to "hide" themselves. This ability DOES increase it just doesn't show the cap (140) (141) but if you look at your stats under skills you will notice that it has increased. My DE is level 30 now and a master at hiding. Usually I sucessfully hide in less then 2 attempts. I know this because my pets does the suicide thing. The only thing is, I used this hide ability almost more then I used my sense heading skill since the ability is innate and those MUST be practiced constantly. The skill does work but if you're level 20 and hardly use it it's the same as using 1hand slash with skill of 10 on a level 20 monster..forget it hehe. Just wanted to get that out there so people don't petition things that just haven't been used :o) Just because a skill doesn't SHOW an increase, please, check your skill standing on your character before you pass judgement on whether or not it works...Thanks.
<br>Nesolak
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to you both for writing in with additional information and insight.  I hope Kindrodru sees it and finds it helpful.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in reference to the gnome who asked how to sneak into Oggok to complete his barkeep quest.  There is another way to get into ogre town without winding up lunch.  L.39+ druids can turn others into doggies, and not even the Evil Ogres will pester him when he's four-footed and fluffy.  This is only true if he hasn't killed too many ogre guards or townies, however.  Eventually they'll get to recognize him as a mutt and barsh him regardless.
<br>Jeff
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the response and additional ideas.  Let's hope the gnome finds you in game when he has finished his quest and invites you to the celebration!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of the expansion, how do we have any idea what faction we should NOT destroy? I know that people have slain aviaks and lizardmen mercilessly. I play an enchanter and am not all that concerned as I know I can just cast a few spells and make them love me, but others may want to keep that in mind in the next few months.
<br>Keigan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you are asking a really good question but I don't have a good answer for you.  If anyone has heard Verant's expansion team speak to the issue of whether factions would carry over to the new critters in the expansion, please let us know.
<br><br>

<b>Thanks to Aluyen and Sorn for writing in on the teams issue for the expansion pack and to Haldin for taking the time to write in on the pvp issues from last week's Q&amp;A columns.  It's great to hear from you all!</b>
