	It was his hunger for power that placed him in this horrible plight, he realized as he hid behind a pile of rubble from a ruined wall.  He had let himself become overeager for power and wealth and now he realized that he might end up paying the final price for his lack of wisdom.  Sadly Xar, a young necromancer, let his thoughts drift back to the events preceding this night as the liche's minions searched through the ruined tower around him. 
<br><br> 
	It all started when he finished his basic guild training and advanced beyond being a neophyte necromancer.  He went to one of the more powerful necromancers in the area and begged to be allowed to become his apprentice.  The necromancer agreed.  
<br><br>
	Xar's thoughts immediately returned to the present as a spectre floated past his hiding place and quickly he cowered deeper into the small hole, hoping to avoid detection.  Luck was with him for now and the spectre continued on it's search, missing him.  Within minutes his thoughts began to wander back to the events which lead up to this nightmare.
<br><br>
	After the necromancer had apprenticed him Xar quickly began to hunger for power.  Although his new Master advised caution and patience he had bolted forward, intent upon learning as much as possible as soon as possible.  He came to deal in information and began seeking rare knowledge and spells.  Looking back he could now see clearly that he had pushed too far and had taken too many risks.  As time passed he learned of a distant, ruined, tower that had been the home of a powerful necromancer.  The tome that told about it also stated that the Tower, which was located deep in the Stonebrunt mountains, had been cut off during an avalanche and that no one had managed to make the crossing to the Tower and that the necromancer's spellbooks were still lost.  The tome also stated that the Necromancer was believed to have a secret way to his Tower but that the information regarding it had been lost when he died and that the only search mounted had turned up nothing.  Xar began to thirst for the potential knowledge he might gain, and also for the honor and glory he would receive if he returned with some of the Necromancer's books.  The scholar Patryn, for example, would pay great sums for a rare spellbook, even if he was a wizard and not a necromancer.  
<br><br>
	Stirring from his musings Xar listened carefully but couldn't detect the sound of the liche's minions around him and determined that the search must have passed him by.  Xar then left hiding and started to make his way closer to escaping from the Tower's ruins.  As he ducked around a corner he heard a chilling howl and barely missed being clawed by the hand of a skeleton.  Ducking he lashed out with a mace and had the satisfaction of hearing one of the skeleton's ribs crack.  As the skeleton was rocked back from the blow he quickly pressed the advantage and after a short fight smashed the skeleton beyond the point of maintaining it's unlife.  Alas the battle had caused enough noise and he was able to hear the sounds of pursuit again.  Hurrying away he again began to run from his hunters.  After dodging through the Tower he managed to lose the undead following him but to his despair he was now deeper into the Tower than he had been and escape was an even more remote possibility.  As he heard the sound of shuffling footsteps in the corridor in front of him Xar leaped through a doorway and ducked around the corner.  Reaching out for something to steady him Xar pressed his hand against a decorative carving of a shield and lost his balance as the wall opened up and dumped him in a secret passageway and then closed behind him.  Xar hurried down the secret passageway found a branch in the tunnels and pausing for breath examined his surroundings.  The secret tunnel appeared to be part of a natural system of caves, to his surprise, and happiness, Xar noticed a small ledge just above head height in the tunnel.  Tucking his mace into his belt and adjusting the pack over his shoulder with both his spellbook and the purloined spellbooks from the necromancer's laboratory he leaped up and pulled himself onto the ledge.  Apparently safe for the moment he pulled out a ration from his pack and sipped a little water from a flask on his belt.  While he refreshed himself and prepared to try to escape he let his mind wander back to it's interrupted reminiscence,  
<br><br>
	Xar began to research the necromancer and in his search he came across a clue which he believed might lead to the secret entrance to the Tower.  Taking a leave of absence from his Master he then began to journey toward where the Tower was supposed to be.  		
<br><br>
	Xar journeyed from his Master's abode deep in the Dead Hills to the coast of Antonica west of there.  After quite a trek he reached a small village, barely worth mentioning, but one where trading ships did put in.  Luck was with him at this time, or as he sourly reflected ill fortune, and a trading ship was there at the time.  For a price the trader agreed to take him to the shore of Odus, south of Paineel.  Traveling north from Odus, he reached Paineel.  After purchasing enough supplies to last him for as long as he thought his search could last Xar left Paineel and traveled northeast deep into the Stonebrunt mountains.  After a long search he had managed to find a tunnel leading into the small valley of ruins which was topped by the Tower of the Necromancer.  Overjoyed at his success and tasting power and riches which he thought were almost within his grasp Xar strode down into the valley, with the confidence that only the young and headstrong can have.  He almost immediately was slapped with cold hard reality as he strode into the city and was nearly beheaded by a scythe wielding spectre which had been out of sight in a ruined building.  Since that moment he hid and skulked until eventually he reached the Tower.  Luckily, or so he thought, there didn't appear to be many of the undead in the Tower itself and he made quick progress toward the top floor.  After finding the tower empty up to this point he was feeling cocky and headstrong and while he opened the door carefully, on guard for traps or perhaps a final undead,  when he opened the door he found a room filled with books and laboratory equipment.  He had reached the Necromancer's lab!  He was thrilled, joy pulsed through his veins as he thought about the power which would be his.  And what a great trophy the spellbooks would make, he'd even show his Master that he was going to be the greatest Necromancer who ever lived and no one would ever tell him he wasn't ready for some knowledge!  He rushed into the room and seeing a pair of books upon a desk and a third upon a stand he checked them first.  They turned out to be exactly what he was looking for.  One was a textbook the Necromancer had written himself detailing higher dealings with the undead and ways to make them respond to your commands easier.  Another was the Necromancer's diary and Xar felt great pleasure at having this for while it would make interesting reading he had no doubt that foolish scholar Patryn would pay most handsomely for a diary, and while not as much as he would for a spellbook Xar wouldn't be giving up arcane knowledge to sell it.  Xar slipped the three books into his pack and turned to hurry out of the Tower and then the ruined city.  As he stepped towards the door practically glowing with triumph he felt a deep chill and a shiver down his spine.  Turning in panic he felt despair wash over him.  Less than fifteen feet behind him was a liche, and from the look of it's tattered robe it was the Necromancer himself!  
<br><br>
	Dread chilled Xar's soul but his instincts saved his life.  Rather than trying any sort of defensive spell, or even stupider, an offensive one, he did the only intelligent thing; he dropped face first on the floor and barely missed being incinerated by a fireball.  The necromancer shrieked his rage and hate as he prepared another spell.  Xar, suddenly feeling quite a bit less cocky, decided that discretion was the better part of valor and ran for his life, backpack thumping with every step.  The Necromancer, despite being dead, hadn't forgotten a thing and this was HIS Tower and HIS valley and it was filled with HIS undead.  Consequently Xar found the Tower VERY lively and he ended up fighting room to room battles with skeletons and stinking zombies.  Adrenaline pulsed in his veins and Xar, feeling victory slipping from his grasp, fought with the might that only comes with ultimate danger.  He did quite well too, looking back upon those battles he realized that he had never fought so well.  Chuckling softly to himself Xar pulled out the Necromancer's spellbook and while stroking it ruefully admitted to himself that he'd never had a better reason to fight well.  His escape from the Tower deserves, he thought, a saga.  Two hellish hours of dodging through rooms, doubling back, and occasionally smashing, beating, or pitching out a window, the undead slaves of the Necromancer who he was unable to avoid or hide from.  He had dodged slow and stupid zombies, shrieking banshees, cunning spectres, and hordes of skeletons but toward the end of his mad dash for freedom, no for life itself, though the tower he found himself staggering with exhaustion as the adrenaline high was leaving his body weak.  However he had managed to reach the first floor of the Tower and slip out a window into a small garden.  After clubbing the zombie there into a pile of stinking, rotting, flesh he leaped up and climbed over the wall.  After that he scurried down a small back path, perhaps an alley.  Then he got lucky and found the hole to hide in and his mind started wandering down this path, reliving his foolishness.
<br><br>
	Xar's mind returned to the present as he rested upon the ledge and hoping that for the moment he was safe he allowed himself to drop off into a light slumber that would hopefully revive him enough to be able to make an escape.  He felt certain that he was in the tunnels below the valley city and that they'd connect somewhere close to the edge of the city and that he might finally escape this nightmare hell.  
<br><br>
	When Xar awoke it was in panic and terror.  His dreams had been haunted by the ghastly face of the Necromancer screaming for him to return the books.  Within minutes he calmed down though and began hurrying in the direction he felt that the secret tunnel out of the valley was.  He walked quickly through the tunnels, carefully on his guard and promising himself not to get overconfident again, at least not until he was out of the valley.  Walking through the tunnels he soon discovered that there was more light than what his spell was providing and he was approaching an exit.  Hope flooded his mind and he stepped forward, albeit cautiously; it saved his life.  As he stepped toward the tunnel exit a skeleton carrying a sword and still wearing chainmail and wielding a sword which gleamed in the light of the spell, obviously a magical blade, dropped into the tunnel in front of him.  It was followed by four others and they began to advance silently toward him, blades raised.  Xar feeling panic mingled with defiance snarled helplessly and dodged into a side tunnel leading, hopefully, to another exit.  Luck was not with him.  As he rushed down the passageway he came to a small, natural, cave; a cave without any exits.  He turned, hoping he might escape down the passage and take a side path that had branched off only a short distance down the tunnel.  As he moved toward the tunnel the Skeleton in the chainmail and it's fellows appeared in the entrance.  Xar backed into the far corner of the cave and felt the cool stone of the wall behind him, moist with condensation, through his robes.  He looked desperately at the skeletons but unlike those that attacked him in the Tower and city before these were all wielding swords and the leader was wearing it's chainmail.  He unslung his mace from his belt, said a prayer for mercy, and then prepared to fight what might be his last battle.  As the skeletons fanned out, always blocking the exit Xar began quickly reviewing the spells he still remembered.  A desperate hope came to him and he quickly mouthed the words to a rare spell that distorted the perceptions of the undead, one that often had the effect of causing them to forget their orders.  Halfway through the spell though he felt a chill presence and stepping up his incantation raised his voice.  A dry chuckle cut through his concentration and he realized with a final despair that the Necromancer himself was in the tunnel and that he didn't have even a prayer.  As the Necromancer stepped into the room with a sinister laugh Xar tried to muster a defiant snarl but all that came out was a hopeless whimper.  As the Necromancer began to incant a mighty spell, far beyond Xar's youthful talents no matter how skilled he might have been, he thought with deep sadness at his failure "and the spellbook would have made such a glorious trophy".  Then the Necromancer completed his spell and Xar raised his mace.  His vision burst into white light and then faded into a timeless darkness.  
<br><br>
	Xar wandered through the city.  His slow shuffling step carried him aimlessly around the streets.  His backpack hung loosely upon his shoulders, filled only with some long since rotted food, the books gone now.  Clutched loosely in his right hand was a rusting mace.  Xar's eyes stared uncomprehendingly as he shuffled down one of the ruined streets.  As he wandered his mind was filled with only one thought; serve the Necromancer.  Xar the Zombie, cursed with mindless unlife, existed only to serve his former enemy, The Necromancer.
