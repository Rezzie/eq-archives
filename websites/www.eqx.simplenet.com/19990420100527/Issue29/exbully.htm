<p style="text-align: justify">
Alan had only been playing EverQuest for about four days.   He would admit he had not done much for a week worth of playing, but he was having fun.  This was only his second OMRPG, the first being Ultima Online.   Most of the four days was spent milling around town, talking with other travelers, and gathering clues about the outside world.  
<br><br>
On his second day Alan had traveled outside of town, which he found was very exciting.  He was quickly killed by a brown bear, loosing all his equipment and gold.  He decided he was not ready for the outside world just yet.  He would need to save his money for better armor and weapon.  He traveled around town doing odd jobs for adventures to increase his funds.  He had gathered quite a lot of gold doing this, and almost had enough for a sword he wanted.  
<br><br>
BigStuff had been playing OMRPG for five years.  He had started with MUDS, then moved to GUI titles like WarCraft, Diablo, UO, and now EverQuest.  He considered himself a good role player, spending at least 12 hours online per day.  
<br><br>
BigStuff could often be found hunting with his guild members.  He rarely took time to socialize, because this would take away time he could have been "Leveling".   He was very unsociable and often only cared about what it took to make himself happy.  He could care less about anyone else he came in contact with.  His guild, Dead Ringer, comprised of five other players just like him.  They were not very liked in the EverQuest community.  Actually they were feared by many, as the group had become very powerful.   It was not uncommon to find him and his guild brothers outside of town, exploiting methods of increasing wealth.
<br><br>
Alan happened to stumble upon BigStuff his fifth day in-game.  BigStuff was standing near the town fountain, obviously bored to death.  He was loaded with nice equipment, and was wearing what Alan guessed to be very expensive plate mail armor.   
<br><br>
Before he could walk past the seasoned fighter, BigStuff called out to him.
<br><br>
"Hey there newbie" He laughed.
<br><br>
"Um. Yea?" Alan said, not really enjoying his new title.
<br><br>
"Where you heading?"
<br><br>
Alan had collected some leather armor from a passing knight.  The Knight had just tossed it like yesterday's trash.  Alan felt he might do better outside of town now.  "I'm heading outside the gates to do a bit of hunting." He replied.
<br><br>
"How would you like to group with me?  I'll get you a few levels."
<br><br>
Alan was very excited.  "Cool!  Thank you.  It is so hard to get started here." He beamed.
<br><br>
"Good.  Follow me."
<br><br>
Alan followed BigStuff out of town.  He was so excited about finally getting to see some of the countryside, having been confined to town for a week.  BigStuff lead him towards a dark forest, which could be seen far to the north.  They traveled quite a long distance, taking several turns here and there.
<br><br>
When they reached the forest, BigStuff cleared an entrance through the thick under-brush that blocked the passage; then entered.
<br><br>
They had been traveling for a while, Alan lost his sense of direction, and suddenly felt very nervous.  
<br><br>
"Hey don't loose me I have no idea how to get back." 
<br><br>
"Don't worry, I wont." BigStuff relied with a snicker.
<br><br>
It wasn't long and they reached the base of a mountain, where the two found themselves surprised by a huge creature.  It was a powerful looking creature comprised of earth and stone.  It towered before them ready to attack.
<br><br>
"Holy Cow" Alan gasped.  He was just about to run when BigStuff commanded.
<br><br>
"NO.  Don't run!  Ready your sword, we can take him."
<br><br>
Alan drew his sword and readied for attack.  He was scared to death, but also excited.  His heart was racing.  COMBAT!  He followed BigStuff into the attack.
<br><br>
BigStuff hit the earth elemental with his short sword, spraying stone from the elemental's body.  This didn't seem to phase the elemental in the least.  The elemental attacked.  He struck BigStuff in the chest knocking him down to the ground.  
BigStuff, picking himself off the ground, turned to Alan and said, "RUUUUUUNNNNNNNN!" and with that, dashed off in another direction.   Alan struck the Elemental, doing little to no visible damage.   
Alan, finding himself alone with his assailant, turned to run but it was too late.  BLAM!  The earth elemental struck him with one mighty blow from his huge fist, killing him instantly.  
<br><br>
Alan appeared in town near the temple.  He was without all his possessions, and very pissed off.  He messaged BigStuff.
<br><br>
"Hey I'm dead.  Where are you?"
<br><br>
"I'm still here with this elemental.  He is chasing me.  I think I can trick him, and lure him away from your corpse."
<br><br>
"Oh thank GOD!  I have a lot of gold I have been saving for some better equipment." Alan said, relieved that he might get his stuff recovered.
<br><br>
"You need to consent me."
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
"You need to consent me so I can get the stuff off your corpse."
<br><br>
Alan did as he was told.
<br><br>
BigStuff put away his short sword and wield a hug war hammer.  He attacked the elemental.  With two mighty hits from his hammer, the elemental fell dead to the ground.  BigStuff grabbed the corpse of Alan and headed for town.  
<br><br>
BigStuff laughed and sent a message to his real victim, Alan. "Your stuff is gone dude.  The elemental looted your corpse.  Sorry man."
<br><br>
Alan was crushed. "SOB I hate this game!"  He said, and then slammed off his computer.  Once again he had lost everything.

<tr><td>How can people live with themselves after this kind of an act, I will never know.  I just think there are some cruel people in this world. Believe me, if your new to the online world, trust me there are people that behave like this (if you don't believe me go check out Ultima Online or visit IRC <g>).
If there are no penalties for breaking rules, abusers will cheat the system.  An exploit can be found anywhere at any time.  No matter what you do.  If you want to control this problem you have to kill it at its source.
<br><br>
How do you spot someone that might be an Online Bully?

I'll paint a picture for you:
<br><br>
1. It was once thought this problem was isolated to adolescents, ages 13-17, but that no longer holds truth.  Chronological age doesn't always reflect mental age these days.<br>
2. A bully has a real problem with acne or some other disfiguring feature.<br>
3. Has a weight problem (too little or too much).<br>
4. Has a major inferiority complex, which is why they need to act this aggression out online.<br>
5. Has never had sex.<br>
6. Was beaten up by other kids as a child.  Mostly little girls.<br>
7. Will never have sex!<br>
8. Thinks he has friends (but they're all online).<br>
9. Has ADS, and won't take medication for it.<br>
10. Thinks the meaning of love is the relationship he shared with his mother.
