Greetings,
 <br><br>
    After reading Issue #34's <a href="../Issue34/monk.htm">article about monks</a> that Wynn Orill wrote, I found he brought some light to the explainations about the monks being warriors. However, at the same time I felt he misrepresented them. To say that monks should not be agnostic is a critical error, for it is the basis of their lives. Christian monks are religious. Buddhist monks are spiritual not religious. The question arrises "Don't they pray to Buddha?" This is a mistake that many westerners have come to adopt. They believed in a force not a god. Since we are accustomed to the concept of men praying to gods we see the same thing when we look at a Buddhist monk meditating or chanting in front of a statue of Buddha. They are in fact attempting to become one with that particular Buddha's energy. The statue, and the chanting are only tools to tap into the subconscious; they are not the subconscious. Siddhartha Guatama said that to follow his path is like crossing a river in a boat. When the other bank is reached you discard the boat. Some people mistake the boat for the other side.
<br><br>
    The monk lives his life in search of wholeness. He tries to balance his spiritual, physical, and psychological abilities because to dwell in one was dangerous. So they fully accept themselves and develop all aspects of humanity. This is where fighting comes in.
<br><br>
    The warrior monk is capable of utilizing the spiritual energy that binds us all. So they developed psychic powers. Invisibility and levitation are a couple of these abilites. They are also able to catch arrows or knock fighting stars out of the way with the flat part of their palm. Tibetan monks are capable of producing heat in order to warm their bodies in the frigid temperatures of the mountains. 
<br><br>
    And if this is not enough, a thousand years ago several groups of mystics combined in the mountains of Japan to form ninjitsu. They included Taoist exiles from China, and different bands of warrior philosophers already dwelling in Japan. It became a mix of Taoism, tantric buddhism, and mikkyo buddhism.
<br><br>
    I've bothered you enough with this history lesson.
