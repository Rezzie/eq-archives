	<em>[Van88]</em>  Will you be able to have striped or streaked hair? Or hair of different color like Pink or Green 
<br><br>
<em>[DrBunny]</em> You can choose several options when you create your character, but within certain limits, those limits usually pertaining to the race you've chosen. An example, a troll's skin is green, so you won't find pink trolls running around. 
<br><br>
<em>Me:</em>  This is an interesting answer on a subject that I have been wondering about for a while now.  How will we choose what our characters look like?  From Brads answer I can make a good guess.  After we choose our race and class (and all that other stuff), we will get a character appearance screen.  We will be picking sex.  That will give us a basic body pattern.  I doubt that we will have the option to change our height or width.  I am guessing that we will have to stick to the standard body type.  We will then have options to pick skin color, eye color, hair color, etc.  Our choices will be from a palette that is based on our chosen race.  So, like Brad said, we will be able to choose green for our troll and maybe gray and brown in varying shades, but not pink.  The same for all the color choices.  We will probably have a selection of hair styles to choose from as well.  In fact, I am guessing that we will have a sort of a Mr. Potato Head character creation method.  The only question is about the degree of customization.  Will we be able to choose between the big red round nose and the Groucho mustachio nose?

<em>*LoMax`*</em> If the game is hackable, how will the hackers be dealt with, if caught?
<br><br>
<em>[DrBunny]</em>  They will be banned from the game, and we will look into legal courses of action as well.
<br><br>
<em>Me:</em>  If any of you know me from Tanarus, you will know that I am a full supporter of pursuing legal action for offenses committed over the Internet.  It’s the only way to fight the faceless freedom that people get by ruining things from behind a computer screen.  Make people responsible for their actions, Internet or not.  Just as I feel that making characters responsible for their actions in a game helps to bring morality and better gameplay to the whole thing, I also believe that morality needs to be brought to the Internet.  Prosecuting illegal assaults made against them would make Sony Interactive Studios America my hero.  Um, well, I guess that one was more of a rant than an extrapolation of what we can expect in EQ...

<em>*FL_Oghma*</em> Could you tell us more about how exp will be used to buy levels, stats, or skills? 
<br><br>
<em>[DrBunny]</em>  Experience isn't used to buy skills or stats per se. Your skills go up as you use them, but they can only go up so much per level, and then also at certain levels you are allowed to learn new skills.
<br><br>
<em>Me:</em>  Wow.  Lot’s of insight into the advancement of characters here.  The only way I can think to describe it is through an example of what I might expect a warriors ability chart to look like.  Don’t worry about the numbers or percentages, it’s just an example.  It’s the concept that is important here.
<br><br>
Level 1
<br><br>
Skill: start% / max %
<br><br>
Swordsmanship: 20% / 40%<br>
Polearms skill: 20% / 30%<br>
Archery: 10% / 20%<br>
Shield parry: 35% / 50%<br>
Tracking*: 0% / 10%<br>
Riding*: 0% / 20%
<br><br>
*Skills that start at 0% would be ones that the player could choose to start with off a list.  He might be given 2 optional skills off a list of 10 or 15.
