Recently I played with my weekly AD&D group and had what you might call an epic adventure.  We, a group of elves and a dwarf (surprise! me) have been, for the better part of a year, involved in a battle for the Underdark between the dark elves and the dwarves.  Events recently came to a head when the dark elves and dwarves gathered up their armies and marched on one another.  Our group has been a skirmishing group for the dwarves, hitting dark elf parties and also fighting monsters that the dark elves had sent upon us.
<br><br>
It started out a typical day, really.  We were following the dark elf army and checking for traps when we discovered a magical ward across a tunnel, just before the tunnel forked.  We dispelled it, and, reasoning that the force that was expecting to be warned by the ward would be down the left tunnel, sneaked up on and dispatched a group of about 20 dark elves.  Congratulating ourselves on our prowess, we rested, re-cast the invisibility spells we have been using to hide us, and continued down the heavier trafficked tunnel.
<br><br>
My dwarf was in the lead, as fighter/cleric, and he was scanning for traps when suddenly a voice boomed out:
<br><br>
"YOU ARE EITHER VERY BRAVE OR VERY FOOLISH TO HAVE REACHED THIS FAR."
<br><br>
Before us appeared a deep dragon, our light flickering off his ebony skin his eyes pools of murky radiance.  Then he breathed.
<br><br>
No one died in that first breath, but most of the group was down to less than ten hit points.  I gamely began attacking it, trying to distract it, while the other cleric healed himself back to full.  I hit it only once that round.  
<br><br>
The next round our mage's haste spell kicked in.  Unfortunately, the rest of the party rolled 1's, which put them into our fumbles table, and two party members wound up stunned for a few rounds.  I hit twice that round, continuing to whack away with my hammers.  The cleric, who had just healed himself, was knocked down to three hit points by the dragon's claws and bite.  Our mage tossed some magic missiles at it to damage it a bit.
<br><br>
Once again the cleric healed himself, and I hit only once, clumsily dropping a hammer early in my attacks.  I re-readied another hammer.   The drake then hit me down to less than ten points.
<br><br>
The next round we lost the initiative, and the dragon cast a spell that radically reduced his armor class.  I now had two hit points left, and needed an 18 or better on a d20 to hit him.
<br><br>
Here is where it becomes epic.  By some unimaginable, hidden ability to come through in the clutch, I rolled my six attacks as follows: 7, 18, 19, 20, 19, 20.
<br><br>
The 20's put me into our critical hit chart for increased damage and the dragon fell, dead as a stone.
<br><br>
I'm still a bit stunned about it.  I saved the party, and myself, by a single act of unimaginable luck.  I had previously joked about my dwarf performing well under pressure and fumbling when the stakes were low, and, well, he sure came through that time.
<br><br>
It's for moments like these that I play RPG's.  EverQuest is my next venue for this, and I have yet to be disappointed.  With my regular party members, and with people picked up on the way, I have survived trains in Crushbone that should have decimated us, and with a party of 8-10th level characters, taken out a level 15 undead king.  I too have been disappointed by the connectivity problems, but I knew they would be resolved.  I just looked at it as another night when all my AD&D buddies were too busy to play, and we postponed it a bit.  
<br><br>
What impresses me most so far is how an intelligent, well disciplined party can really do amazing feats if they keep their heads.  Oh, to be sure, I have died when over-reaching, but it is still the love of the drama that keeps me in Norrath day after day.
<br><br>
Enjoy this issue!
