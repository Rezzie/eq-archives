Crossing the bridge, Arthedain slowed down as he approached the gate.  He had thought
he heard a noise, but with the roaring of the stream, sounds were muffled a bit in
this room.  About a hundred feet from the gate, he heard a baying sound which chilled
his blood.  The Gnolls were coming down the corridor by the gate.  "I’m dead! This is
the end!" He panicked and turned to run back over the bridge, only to see a 30 foot
long snake rear it’s head and focus on him.

Hysterically, Arthedain drew his sword and prepared to deal with the foe that faced
him, even as the Gnolls crossed the gate’s threshold.  Arthedain had come to the end,
the moment when all was left was the brave and defiant stand against impossible
odds.  "Boy, Oghma would love this story," he thought crazily.  "It’s right down his
dwarf bard storytelling alley!"

Arthedain’s mind rocked with a blinding shout to his head.  What new hell was this?
Was he losing his mind?
<br><br>
*Battle me not!  Enter the stream below, it will take you to the upper world.  I will
deal with the Hairy Ones!*
<br><br>
With a slithering rush, Slsslythk passed Arthedain to confront the Gnolls.
