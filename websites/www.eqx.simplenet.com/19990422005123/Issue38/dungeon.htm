Hot red lava boiled up from the open sores in the earth.  The fumes from the burning sulfur tickled my nose.   I paid close attention to my footing, as to not end up a victim to this display of the earth's power.  Each of our party's footsteps made a crunching sound as we walked on the crust of the once hot lava.  We were not very stealthy in our movement.  
<br><br>
Two days ago we left Freeport.  It had been a rough trip this far, but Edarion assured me the trip ahead was even tougher.   Not being a very big fan of pain, I had been complaining the entire trip.  
<br><br>
"This crap will do nothing for my leather boots!  I just thought I would bring that to your attention.   Do you know what leather crafted boots cost these days?!"  I squawked.  
<br><br>
Edarion and Jalen laughed.  
<br><br>
Edarion was a Paladin.  He loved to fight.  From the minute he handled his first sword, Edarion knew he wanted to be a warrior.   His father was a cleric and taught him the ways of the cleric, and of the healing power he could posses.   But it was never to be enough action for Edarion.
<br><br>
"If memory servers me, its just ahead of that rise." Edarion advised.
<br><br>
"Did you see the flying dogs that breath fire?" Jalen questioned.
<br><br>
"Aye.  Make sure you keep moving.  We should be able to evade them."
<br><br>
"Flying Dogs?   Fire?" I sighed.  "I didn't agree to this." 
<br><br>
Edarion and Jalen ignored my comments and continued to climb the hill.  I followed cautiously behind them, and at a fair distance.
<br><br>
Ahead I saw the entrance to the dungeon.  Two gigantic golden doors that once guarded the entrance lay broken from their hinges.  Behind the doors were a pair of twenty-foot walls, which were perfectly smooth, carved into the earth's crust.  The hall continued as far as I could see into the darkness.
<br><br>
"Be alert guys this is..."  
<br><br>
Before Jalen could finish his sentence a mountain of flame was upon us, burning the exposed skin on our bodies.   The attacker stood the height of a human being.  It had appendages like a human but were very distorted an not symmetrical.  The entire composition of the creature appeared to be made up of flames.  Jalen swung his sword at the creature striking it square in the arm.  The creature growled in pain.
<br><br>
"We can kill it!"  Jalen commanded.  
<br><br>
With that the three of us commenced to attack the creature.  All three of us took turns exchanging blows on the creature.  With each swing of my sword, as my hand came close the to the creature, my skin would sting from the flames.  With a combined blow from the swords of Jalen, the Barbarian, and Edarion the Paladin, the flaming creature dropped to the ground, where it continued to burn.  
<br><br>
"Better head on in." Jalen said as he pointed off to my left.  
<br><br>
I looked in that direction to see two more of these creatures heading towards us.  Without any disagreement to Jalen's suggestion, we headed into the entrance to the dungeon.
<br><br>
The dungeon was dark and damp.  Typical milieu you'd expect to find in a dungeon.  We followed the passage, which continued straight ahead of us.  After a few hundred feet of travel the passageway opened up into a large antechamber.   Ahead passageway continued straight.  We decided to rest up here before we continued on.  Sounds of creatures could be heard in the distance ahead, where we expected to find a fight.  
<br><br>
After a short break we continued our journey.  The sounds coming from the darkness grew louder as we walked forward.  Ahead I could see light, coming from a lighted torch on mounted on the wall.
<br><br>
"Somebody must live here." I stuttered.  
<br><br>
"Stay close to me and you might survive this." Edarion barked.
<br><br>
I didn't argue with him.  
<br><br>
The passage broke ahead to the left.   We turned the corner, which allowed us to see the room ahead.  The passage continued about forty more feet and opened up into other room.  In the room I could see four massive figures huddled about a campfire.  They appeared to be tossing some unknown small object to the floor.   A type of game I guessed.  
<br><br>
"Um.   I think we should leave them alone guys."
<br><br>
"Shoosh you fool."  Edarion whispered.  
<br><br>
These creatures were the ugliest things I think I had ever seen.  A huge fat globby bald head sat perched upon a pair of immense shoulders.  Attached to each shoulder was a slab of meat, which served as an arm, and a huge hand attached at the end of each arm, which could flatten me with one swat.
<br><br>
They didn't seem to notice our presence.  
<br><br>
"I'll lure them out.  Jalen you back me up."  Edarion said as he sneaked forward.  
<br><br>
Jalen followed Edarion as they creaped forward slowly.  I crouched behind Jalen.  
<br><br>
It was then, as usual, my luck ran out.  With a loud "Clang Cling Clang" my sword dropped from my hand, and onto the ground.  All four of the hideous creatures stopped the game and looked in our direction.  
<br><br>
"Oh s#$%"
<br><br>
"UG BRRRK UGGG!" One of the creatures screamed and ran to the right and out of sight.  
<br><br>
The other three creatures clutched their massive clubs and headed in our direction. 
<br><br>
Showing some form of communication, which surprised me, they issued commands to each other in their basic tongue and assembled an attack formation.   
<br><br>
The six of us readied for combat.  
<br><br>
To Be Continued...
