	Two days later memorial services were held when the body of the warrior
	captain washed up on the shore near Qeynos, and the prayers of the masses
	at the Temple of Rodcet Nife were with the men who actively hunted for
	signs of the necromancer. The Warrior captain was given a proper hero's
	burial, and his body blessed against the evils of the undead. History
	would forget the captains deeds at sea as the memories were washed from
	the minds of the magic users that were aboard, replaced with the new
	comfortable memories of innocence and the vile deeds of the necromancer
	they once called a companion.

The guards were alerted and warned of this Yvette, and knew to prepare for
the worse if she returned to the city. The captain of the guard offered a
reward for the men who would bring her to justice the Paladin's way: death.

Yvette regarded her boots with renewed interest, listening to the
methodical shoveling of the two dock hands she hired to bury the dead
sailor. She seemed lost in her own world as the two whispered back and
forth to each other. She stood in the same stance, her black gown and
robes slashing in the strong gulf winds. She was like a black dagger
sticking out of the earth, unmoving yet still threatening, indeed the
two men feared her greatly.

"I tell you she's not natural," one said to the other. "Tell me how the
blimey she drug this bloke all the way out here, this box weighs a good
three or four men - and 'e ain't all that big" he whispered.
<br><br>
"It's called dead weight Joey, my ol' man told me about all the guys he
buried during the Goblin Wars, and he said they had three men to a body,"
the other said cautiously.
<br><br>
"Yeah but bro she is just a lithe thing." He paused to take a long look
at her womanly form in the breeze, and then continued to toss dirt on the
box the sailor was in. "Maybe she sailed in, and the boat is somewhere
nearby. She could have floated that box over here on the water."
