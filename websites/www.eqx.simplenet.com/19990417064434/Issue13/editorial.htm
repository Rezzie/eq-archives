I filled out my application for the beta.  Did you?
<br><br>
EverQuest Express is moving.  Right now it looks like we will be going to www.eqx.simplenet.com.  
I'll make certain to let you all know our new URL via the Avault news group, the major search engines, the 
EverQuest home page, and anyone else that will print it.
<br><br>
I want to thank the many folks that have offered to host EQX.  I have been overwhelmed with the 
offers I have received, all of them very generous.
<br><br>
But for now I have decided to move to a Simplenet.  That may change once again when Kit 
(yes, the mystical one of legend and rumor) returns.  Like I said, the offers were very interesting...
<br><br>
Thanks for reading.
