My blood runs cold when I think of them.
<br><br>
I've spent decades here… not months or years.  I've dwelt in this place when I could have been out enjoying myself.  For forty-one years I've hired followers, built shrines, loaded tombs with powerful corpses.  I've taken every care that I could ever imagine and put it into the placement of my enchantments and the positioning of my traps.  I've lured the most magnificent and malicious beasts in the known world and a few that are not from this world into my abode and given them places of prominence and placated them with food or treasure.  And it seemed a labor of love.
<br><br>
Then the six of them stroll into my dungeon and destroy all my work in a weekend!
<br><br>
Curse heroes!  Curse them all!  Adventuring fools.  Their only goal in life is to locate a place not unlike my own then defeat all of its protections, slay all of my pets, and make off with my treasure.  Damn them!
<br><br>
In the nearby hamlet of Smokewood I am billed as the Dreadlord Cirithian.  I know this because one of the six-a bard from the party-has dubbed their little foray into my life "Journey into the Barrow of the Dreadlord".  
<br><br>
It's a trait with these vagabonds.  Not only must they foil my plans and soil my work, but they must then go off and boast about it.  They are so fond of their flowery story titles.  I had a good friend of many years killed a few decades back.  They called that piece of marauding murder "Dwellers of the Tomb of Horror".  Another fellow I only heard of… a psychic fellow with a head like a squid… was slain by dwarves and gnomes.  The tale they told was passed off to others as "Descent to the Depths of Chaos".
<br><br>
Fact is, people love to concentrate on your downfall, but never on your achievements.  I have an entire diabolical rise to power that does little to gain mention!  I spent forty-one years building the most feared corner of this plane.  I killed hundreds of would-be assassins through use of my various traps and clever ruses.  I once had a band of adventurers wander into my chambers with so little strength that I didn't even cast a spell to defeat them.  But no one cares.  They're just happy to see you fall.
<br><br>
Were bards running around telling tales of Cirithian, champion of the Cursed Depths, slayer of scores of men, terror of the Foul Woods?  Did they give me any respect at all?  No.  The mention of me in tales is that I am "an evil that must be defeated".  Now what sort of proper credit is that?  I am an evil genius, not just some sort of… um… evil… guy.  They make me out to be a cardboard villain!
<br><br>
It takes great care to develop defenses that will weather the storm of sword-wielding would-be demigods and arrow spewing forest elves.  One must have great foresight when it comes to the defenses used against the menagerie of spells from mages and illusionists and all manner of priests.
<br><br>
So when these six desecraters entered my beloved labyrinth, I'd expect more of a mention in their tale than a footnote saying *=Cirithian was an evil guy.
<br><br>
Not even a brief hint at the many who had fallen before them.  My decades of evil were simply shrugged aside by the townsfolk.
<br><br>
I work and I slave!  Sometimes I wonder why I bother!  It's all so very thankless.
<br><br>
I can hear a party down in the village right now, off in the distance.  The sounds of the minstrels are wafting their way all the way to my lonely cave deep set into the side of Redplume Mountain.  I can hear them laughing and celebrating at my expense.
<br><br>
But I must persevere.  You see, I know that these bastards will be back.  It may take them 'til the Silver anniversary of their victory to do it, but I will be ready.  I must begin to rebuild again and when they come calling next time my dungeon of terror will be twice as horrid!
<br><br>
Maybe it's time to get some new partners to help and defer the cost of building a dungeon.  I hear there's a red dragon in Avalon looking for a grim and rainy place to settle down.  I've always done my best to avoid those off-planar investors.  Sometimes you're making a nasty little dungeon, next thing you know there are parades of imps and low level demons tripping over your devices because your partner wants the dungeon to be busier!
<br><br>
This experience has taught me one thing.  The media is important.  I must infuse myself into prophecy, make appearances in crystal balls, hire a public relations bard, or do something to make my name known!
<br><br>
By the gods who only watch, given a second chance, I will defeat the invading bastages.
<br><br>
Or I am not Cirithian the Dreadlord.
<br><br>
Hmm.  Doesn't sound all that impressive.  Perhaps it should be longer.
<br><br>
Cirithian the Dreadlord of the dungeon of Bottomless Evil!  No, wait.  That sounds like my monsters are running around without pants.  Well, longer is not always better.  Stop snickering, you know what I mean!  Besides, I've got to discuss the cost of changing my monograms on all my robes with my accountant.
<br><br>
What is a hero without a truly great villain?  I'll answer that.  He's a guy with a sword, sitting around in a tavern and swilling cheap ale.  Without me, they are nothing.  And I will spend the rest of my days preparing to remind them of this fact.
<br><br>
Now I must end this writing.  There are new plans to be drawn up, and I must set an appointment with the local prophet about getting my name out there and better known.
<br><br>
Dreadlord Cirithian, keeper of the bottomless pit of evil.  (That's much better)
