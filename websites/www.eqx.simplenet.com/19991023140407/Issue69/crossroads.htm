			Amidst the stony Butcherblock Range<br>
			T'ween Kaladim royal and fair Felwithe<br>
			A road foreboding and passing strange<br>
			Wends it's frightful gore strewn way
<br><br>
			Many brave men, a woeful sight<br>
			Broken and beat about the valley<br>
			Their fate t'was sealed by ogre might<br>
			Rapacious Corflunk and grave Zarchoomi
<br><br>
			Whilst many another other folk<br>
			Wouldst stay at home abed aloof<br>
			Four stepped forth as strong as oak<br>
			From neath the cities sheltering roof
	<br><br>
			To challenge the reign of  foul death<br>
			Brave Bascome and Koranek joined<br>
			With Legdien and Remido both<br>
			To rid the path of life purloined
<br><br>
			Not without a share of daunting<br>
			Did the fellows go a'hunting<br>			
			Ogres have a way of pouncing<br>
			To make you prey in ways surprising
<br><br>
			But lo upon the road they 'peared<br>
			Corflunk first and then Zarchoomi<br>
			Huge hammer blows as back they reared<br>
			Rained upon us monumentally
<br><br>
			By taunt and tease we tested them<br>
			By song and steel we bested them<br>
			By heart and soul we rested then<br>
			For by and by they'll rise again
<br><br>
			Yet even through eternal worry<br>
			A bard in truth can sing the story<br>
			For when in Norrath heroes foray<br>
			Anyone might rise to glory
