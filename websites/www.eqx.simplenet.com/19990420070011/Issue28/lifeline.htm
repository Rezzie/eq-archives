"Pay no attention to that Archanalia Behind the curtain!"
<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Friar
<br><br>
(I believe that's Psalm 16 verse 12 in the book of Sony.)
<br><br>
I began this article with the intent of writing about Internet life, and the friends we make online.  I find myself coming back and putting a the following disclaimer at the beginning so that people don't start reading this figuring it's only about RPG's:
<br><br>
This is, undoubtedly, an article about me (The subject I know best... In fact the only subject of which I can truly claim to be an expert);  specifically, about life online.  And away we go...
<br><br>
I had gone to Circuit City with the intention of purchasing a computer strictly for use in generating graphics, perhaps some word processing.  When asked if I was going to be doing anything "Online," I turned the phrase over in my head a few times.  ONLINE.  One of those new buzzwords. "Probably not," I told him, and he told me the system I had chosen was fine because it only had a 2400 Baud Modem.  Happy with my purchase I went home.
<br><br>
Lo and behold, included was all the gratuitous throwaway software.  AOL, Compuserve, MSN, Prodigy.  So I figured an e-mail account would be a bit of a hoot.  We were using an ancient DOS based e-mail system at work and I thought it might be neat to try one out at home, though it was beyond me who I'd actually e-mail.  So I arbitrarily chose Prodigy.  (Being an artist, I probably liked their little "star" logo).
<br><br>
Why do I mention all this?  I started to think about my online history after reading an article by a member of the QGirlz Quake clan.  She spoke of online relationships, and that brought some interesting memories to bare.  So stick with me while I get through a few paragraphs of evolution before we get to the subject of this article.
<br><br>
So anyway, after playing with Gopher, visiting ALT newsgroups, and subsequently making newsgroup friends who I would e-mail with, it seemed to me that this thing called THE WEB that I couldn't figure out (especially not with the outdated Prodigy browser) was way too slow to be interesting.  After two months of figuring out the web, I dumped Prodigy for Netcom, because their software worked and all I cared about now was e-mail and the web.  And I got a real modem.
<br><br>
Found myself (happily) forgetting why I had bought this computer.
<br><br>
So I'm reading a website.  A poetry website.  Not bad, really.  Then I click on the "About Me" button, and a phrase pops up that I hadn't seen previously.  The poetess directs the readers, "Feel free to e-mail me, but I am married, so don't try to chat me up!"
<br><br>
Chat me up?  I hadn't heard the phrase, but I could guess what she meant.  Believe it or not, it had never occurred to naïve little Archanalia (then known by a non-virtual, mortal name), that there was a class of people out there who were looking for love at 28.8.
<br><br>
What kind of woman would be crazy enough to meet a guy through the Internet.  Yikes!  Surely nobody I'd ever want to associate with!
<br><br>
I couldn't have been more wrong of course.  I met Heather on ALT.HORROR, and we found out we both were avid Clive Barker fans.  Anyway, we e-mailed each other.  Then she sent me some poems.  Fool that I am, I sent her a cassette of some songs I had written on guitar-horrible, dreadful, sad stuff.  (The cassette fell into the wrong hands, but that's another story entirely.)
<br><br>
Anyway, after a year and a half online, I flew up to Oregon and met my virtual friend.  She was as pretty as her picture.  She remains my best friend to this day (About 3-1/2 years later), though hundreds of miles still separate us.
<br><br>
So while I started out as a 26 year old child with a new toy and no idea what it was used for, in the space of months I was carrying on a strong friendship with someone who would never have met otherwise.  Since then she's come down my direction and we went to 6-Flags Magic Mountain and had a blast.
<br><br>
What kind of loony carries on with a total stranger via the net?  The best kind :)

"You gotta try this tank game."
<br>
"Have you tried that tank game yet?"
<br>
"I was getting my butt kicked but having a good time in that tank game last night…"
<br><br>
Alright already.  Absor (alias Gumby) was online playing the now infamous Sony Interactive Studios Game Tanarus.  As many readers of Forum.Everquest on  AVAULT know, Absor and I work together-Well, two floors apart, but for the same agency, doing similar jobs.  I felt obligated to try out this game that he said was tough but fun.  And indeed it was.
<br><br>
Due to this game the number of online relationships I held was burgeoning from one to a phenomenal number; all because I was willing to enter a game and get the daylights beat out of me by folks more skilled than myself.  I had people asking me for my ICQ number (which has subsequently been deleted), my e-mail address, and coming into arenas just to say "hi".
<br><br>
What's more, people have a tendency to equate being "popular" in a game with being "good" at it.  A big mistake.  I love Tanarus, but I am merely a bullseye with a sense of humor.
<br><br>
Imagine my surprise when I discovered not everybody was there for fun.  Most were there to compare testosterone levels (That's the clean way of saying "to check out each other's size").  It's the unfortunate side effect that people who feel wholly inadequate in the real world drag their bad attitudes onto the net and lash out at those around them.
<br><br>
At that time I adopted the pseudonym SPARTACUS for tank combat.  Fellow Co-Worker/Non-Computer guy "Tagalong" joined us and together with Gumby, we founded PHENOMENA and became Rain_o_Fish, Crop~Circle, and FooFighter.  Team Bullseye might have been a better name.  We didn't solicit team members, they just came and asked.
<br><br>
Because of our rampant and unrestrained newsgroup posting, we became minor celebrities.  And we picked up Easter_Isle and Apparition through virtue of our wit and good attitude.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
So I think I can sum this all up best by paraphrasing something I wrote the first week I was on the Tanarus newsgroup.  I can't remember the exact words and I didn't think to save the post, but I assure you it was quotable :) .  I was speaking of Tanarus (but I hope it will apply to Everquest) when I said…
<br><br>
"...I'm too old to play sports, and too young for the retirement home; this IS my social club…"
<br><br>
If there were any point to all this, it is that the one thing that the Internet has done for me is create a larger world.  Before I got that first modem and ISP account, the world began somewhere around San Diego and ended at Riverside County (CA).  Computers were things that screwed up your bank account, not the vehicles by which you can travel anywhere in seconds.  Friends were hard to keep as there was the weight of a long distance bill and plenty of letters to write and mail.
<br><br>
Essentially, there is a lot to be gained from this game.  I like to think that what brings someone to play a role-playing game for the first time is their desire to interact with others… Not so much a desire to fantasize about being someone else, someplace else (that is the addictive side effect gained later).
<br><br>
And so with the weight of the world crushing you due to school, work, bad relationships, excessive demands on your time, psyche, and will, it becomes difficult to leave behind all that you are on a daily basis.  I tend to think that people who are jerks online are jerks in real life, but who's to say?  Maybe he/she just had a really bad day and this is their way of venting.  But there is a better way…
<br><br>
Role-playing is actually therapy.  I'm sure many people know this; role-playing is actually a practice created by psychiatrists for the purpose of helping you understand what it's like to be someone else, and subsequently understand yourself better and how you are viewed by others.
<br><br>
It's my fervent desire that when folks enter the game, they leave the school-yard bullies and the arrogant bosses behind.  This isn't about getting even; it's about being someone else.  Not a victim, but at the same time, not necessarily to assume the bully's role.  I tend to think that there is a great unharvested wealth of role-players out there amid the popping and throbbing world of Quake, and that they just have to realize that unlike life, the whole thing is not about acquisition and about being the biggest bad-ass who ever walked the globe; it's about bonding and through their mutual enjoyment of the game, working together and creating a legend.
