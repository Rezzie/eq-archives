A recent thread on the Stratics Westwood tavern board got me thinking, so I'm going to plagiarize from my post and add to it.  The thread was titled <b>Role-playing - what does it require?</b> The general thrust of the conversation was that Verant was not supplying enough for us to role-play in Norrath.
<br><br>
One of the things that is most notable, to me, about a lack of RP'ing is when individuals act as if there are no limits to their behavior.    Dark Elves chatting and grouping with High Elf paladins - Dwarves and Ogres trading and selling items for mutual benefit.  A druid casting Spirit of Wolf on a warrior so they can kill wolves and kodiaks.  The main point is - just because it's a game advantage to do something, doesn't mean you should do it. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, most people find it more important to gain an extra point of damage on a weapon or an extra +2 ac than to act as if the character was not interested in certain things, or disliked certain things, or was afraid of certain things. If we acted this way in RL, no one would buy food that tasted better than bread and milk, everyone would trade in their cars for one which was 10 mph faster or save an additional 3 mpg as soon as they could, and there would be no racism, since interacting with 'x' race may contain monetary advantage.   Towns would be empty, since advancement depends on camping at work.  If you were born with low stats, you'd spend exorbitant amount of money trying to overcome them lifting weights for strength and eating fish for brain power.
<br><br>
Color and shade depend on contrast, and what you often find in Norrath is the same character, played over an over again, with different race/class combinations.   The character is called Whatcanigetforfreetobuffmegoodtogetmoreexpandstuff.
<br><br>
What does an RPG *require*? 
<br><br>
Nothing more than players who role-play and a setting. Graphics, game engine, and game-play are not nearly as important.  You can role-play Monopoly - acting as a real estate tycoon in turn of the century Atlantic City.  Many MUDs get by on text and role-playing, and are fantastic environments, even with bugs and crashes.   EverQuest as a game is an amply sufficient setting for role-playing.  There are towns, deities, histories, and races which can interact to create a useful tapestry in which to weave your characters story-line.  While some think there should be more of these things, more guidelines and Verant-created story-line, there is actually already enough information out there to add color to your character and give him/her a background to do great deeds, slay the dragons, and marry the love of your life.
<br><br>
The most important thing is players who role-play, who are willing to create and maintain the illusion of Norrathian life.  Certainly there are some suspensions of belief you must do, some things that will intrude on an attempt to have a seamless experience.  If your character is not frantically seeking an item to buy, turn off /auction.  Turn off /ooc and ignore shouts that aren't in character.   If someone doesn't hop right in to role-playing with you, don't expect them to, just go on and find others that do. If someone kewl-d00ds at you, ignore them. Find those who do role-play and play with them. I have an absolute blast when I play using these guidelines, almost without fail.  My experience in Norrath is a continuous fun time.
