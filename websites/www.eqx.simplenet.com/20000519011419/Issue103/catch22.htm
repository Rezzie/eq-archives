I was brought up on myths.  At the risk of setting off some kind of warning signs to teachers with a distinctly Christian agenda, when I was a kid I think the reason I stopped believing in God had to do with myths we were taught in school.
<br><br>
"Mrs. Smith," yes, that was the teacher's name in 4th grade, "So Prometheus really gave fire to man?"
<br><br>
"No, Darren, that's just a Myth."
<br><br>
"Mrs. Smith, so God gave fire to man?"
<br><br>
"Well, that depends on what religion you follow."
<br><br>
Now that made no sense to me.  Either he did or he didn't.  The Greeks are telling me that Zeus hurled lightning bolts but the Christians are saying that only God controls the weather.  And when you ask who is right, the Christians say, "We are".  Why?  Because we say so.
<br><br>
Truth is, I wanted them all to be true.  I loved these stories, from Arachne being changed to a spider to Lazarus rising from the dead.  I wanted there to be something supernatural about the world.  But all of the stories conflicted with one another.  No proof, no belief.
<br><br>
So one day I see this book.  A kid in my 6th grade class at another school has this book and I recognize the centaur and the medusa on the cover.  The title says ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS MONSTER MANUAL.  It was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.
<br><br>
I might point out that mythology takes many forms, comic books being the greatest modern form of mythology.  It used to be that one sat about and relayed tales to the younger folk about things fantastic and fearsome.  I suppose out there somewhere households still do that.  In my house I supposed I could sit someday, if I have kids, and tell them the tale of Bucketman, from my own childhood (which I will get to later).  The upshot is that now, thanks to Gary Gygax and a handful of polyhedral dice, for the next many years rather than just burying myself in comic books, I had this game to play and all the other games that were birthed from its success.  Far more interactive than any book, because you were there and better than boardgames because winning was simply surviving.
<br><br>
Role-playing was the first time I ever belonged.  And it wasn't just for stuff I could find while adventuring.  Oh, sure I absolutely loved finding a sword of sharpness or bracers of defense, but the thing that was so great was actually coming into contact (if only in my head) with things I'd only read about.  And after I'd met a Titan, cut the head from the Medusa, rode the Pegasus, I was able to encounter things I'd never heard of before.  New myths of GM construction.
<br><br>
My mother once said of my best friend Joe, "He worries me.  It's like he always thinks he's playing those games."
<br><br>
I laughed at that.  She had obviously watched Rhona Jaffe's "Mazes and Monsters" and was believing that people actually slipped into a D&D induced delirium.  By the way… Tom Hanks should be reduced by one Oscar for daring to promote such shameless nonsense.  Great actor, but I'd like to kick his butt all the way down "The Great Hall".
<br><br>
Truth is, we were hardcore players.  We never said, "My character went to Greyhawk".  It was more like, "I went to Greyhawk and burned down the mage's guild."
<br><br>
We weren't insane, just mildly rabid about our hobby.  And that's how I wanted to be about EverQuest.  It was going to be the ultimate interactive myth.  And to date it is, as UO and Asheron's Call certainly don't fit the bill.
<br><br>
If you want a study in human nature, go into a Toys-R-Us and pick up a board game.  So you're staring at "Hungry Hungry Hippos" or "Sorry" and you notice that on the box it says "Fun for All Ages" or "Fun for ages 5 and up".  So that's great and you take it home to the family.  Now what invariably happens?  The child who is the "banker" in monopoly will be caught at least once paying for property with bank money instead of his own.  A child will win and proceed to taunt his opponents mercilessly.  Another child will lose and storm off in a fit or turn the board over spilling all the pieces in a tantrum.
<br><br>
Fun for all ages indeed.
<br><br>
Admit it folks: While money is the best part of a game like poker, board games and video games don't have such overt motivating factors.  Actually beating your friends head-to-head is the thing that makes you play.  I played games against my brother all the time.  Perhaps why I stopped playing boardgames and why I was never a great sportsman… I am very competitive on some things but not on those.
<br><br>
That's the one good thing about having a sibling.  The bad thing is that if he's older he can often beat you.  If I never credited my brother with anything, I credit him with this: He was the yardstick by which I did my best to achieve.  He was two and a half years older, but the fact that we were so competitive with each other is what made me always try and understand what he was talking about or to play the same games he was playing.  I was labeled a "gifted" kid and placed into tougher classes because I was just trying to keep up with somebody older than me and I didn't know any better than to slow down.
<br><br>
Ironically, the class I was placed into was that 4th grade class where I learned mythology.  So if I don't believe in God you can go ahead and blame my brother.
<br><br>
I have a sense that he's also responsible for some of that sarcasm in the last paragraph.
<br><br>
Anyway, I moved into RPGs because they held the things that I found most fascinating.  Gods, beasts, heroes, naked chicks (Well, actually that was a few years later that I discovered naked chicks in myths).  Some of them had superheroes, others had radioactive beasts and vampires.  What more could an adolescent want (except, of course, naked chicks).
<br><br>
And with time we had burned down, blown up, zapped, microwaved, and hurled out into space every menace we could think of in this time space continuum or the next.  Bif, Bam, Pow.
<br><br>
Some of the luster fades after a while.  A GM (game-master to those of you who have never played paper and pen RPGs) has certain responsibilities.  Number one is to continue the story.  Number two is to entertain the players and keep them interested.  Both of these things figure into what's both great and bad about paper RPGs.
<br><br>
To continue the story, sometimes the GM will "fudge" a die roll.  That is, the monster really did make the roll that severs the hero in half, but because that would end the story, kill all the helpless humans nearby, and doom the entire team of adventurers to eternity in hell, he is likely to decide that the die roll came up differently than it did.  Personally, the most I would do is have him miss, though next time it wasn't likely that he would if I were to actually make the roll.
<br><br>
Duty number two, to entertain the players, is what made me do more Gamemastering than playing for about five years.  I loved coming up with something original to happen to the players.  I'm not nearly as good at that now.  If you come to an area and you catch your GM just studying the monster manual page by page then you know he's been GMing too long and has run out of ideas.
<br><br>
We run across the same two duties of the maker of EverQuest in their obligation to those who buy it: To further the campaign and to entertain.
<br><br>
They've seen to the furthering of the campaign by not making death Permanent.  If you made a character, fought with him for two solid days and got him up to 6th level (which would make you better than me at this) and your character was squashed by a griffin that somebody dragged over the spot where you were fighting, that might be "realistic" but it sure wasn't fun.  So element one and two both collapse.  You could make a new character, but that would be a huge hassle.  In that regard, I think the EQ team made great strides toward a logical game with some longevity to it.
<br><br>
And the creative minds behind EQ have done their best to make the world interesting.  And often they achieve a certain amount of awe.  When I first entered a strange zone and came upon the massive doors to Najena, I didn't dare enter.  I asked the folks outside what lay beyond the doors.  They were tougher than I and they dared not enter yet so I did not either.  That fear for your virtual life is an important part of the design of this game or any other.
<br><br>
But my favorite character (Ezmend) entered Lavastorm at about 10th level.  He is now 16th, nearly 17th level and he has yet to leave except to sell and buy components for spells.  He's pulling down money and there are still things in here he can handle, whereas I've had trouble finding a balance in other zones.  That's not to say there aren't any worthy zones, as I'm sure there are.  The problem is that I've burnt out on this place a bit.  But worst of all, I've burnt out on the tactics.
<br><br>
When you are a low-level character it's a wise thing to stand back and cast a spell and drag the bad guy to the edge of the zone and fight him.  It's even wiser to stay near a guard.  But level after level, this all becomes the same thing with a different zone.  I go to Befallen and the tactic is the same.  I go to West Commonlands and the tactic is the same.  I go to Splitpaw…
<br><br>
Enter the Guide/GM driven events.  Has anyone participated in these?  According to the notes I see on various boards there are a lot of second hand comments.  "My friend, Aborigineez, participated in the dynamic quest this weekend…".  Unfortunately, I've yet to be around when one happens.  And I've been an EQ player since just before beta 2 began.  That's a long time to "Hold monster, blast it, enfeeble monster, blast it".
<br><br>
No game will ever make everybody happy.  And I sympathize with the GM decision not to post when such events will happen, as there would be a server/zone overload with folks dying to participate.  I just find it sad that a loyal player who has done plenty to promote the game and who has paid as much for the game as anyone else, can't seem to find a quest that isn't something automated that everyone else has done a thousand times.  Inevitably, when I follow that rainbow to find the pot of gold at the end I find a group of folks waiting for it to respawn.
<br><br>
The saddest part of all I suppose is nobody's fault but my own.  If there perhaps was an active dynamic quest underway and I were present at the time… I undoubtedly would be too low level to play.  And this is because I've lost interest and therefore can not raise the character, because there are no dynamic quests for me to play.  The proverbial catch-22.
<br><br>
That's the good thing about the old RPGs.  You were always the right level.
<br><br>
So it's thanksgiving tomorrow as I write this, though it probably won't be published until I'm on vacation the week after.  I will most likely see my family, including my brother tomorrow and we'll all have turkey, eat like ogres at a smorgasbord, and if I remember to do so, I'll hit my brother upside his head for my current EverQuest woes.  As anyone can see, it's plainly his fault.
<br><br>
I never did get around to the "bucketman" story.  It's a myth around my household.  I'll just have to save it for another article.
