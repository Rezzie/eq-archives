<em>OK, so role-playing is a big issue right now.  I've got a pickle for ya.  When you start out in EverQuest, you are understandably pretty wussy.  Say you're role-playing an Erudite Wizard who has been studying the art of magic all your life.  When you create your character in EverQuest, how do you explain the fact that, although you have all these years of experience, the best trick you can do right now is lighting your thumb on fire?
<br><br>
Question asked by Erdrick</em>
<br><br>
Interesting question Erdrick. How do you role-play an existing character? You pretty much can't. When entering Norrath you will have to create a new background for you character, and let it roll from there. No sense in trying to role-play a very experienced mage when you are really nothing more than a newbie. Let's take a deeper look into this.
<br><br>
Role-playing has many definitions if you ask different people and even those definitions are left up to interpretation. What you need to do as a role-player is choose how you want to role-play and stick to that. For instance, at character creation you could have written a vast background for your character, but when you get into Norrath none of it fits. Well, rewrite it within the guidelines of Norrath. Simple as that.
<br><br>
You may leave little quirks that are easily emoted. An example would be Joror the Barbarian Shaman has a severe fear of spiders. In Norrath we have all seen that spiders seem to be plentiful, so as that character every time you saw a spider you could react accordingly. Maybe cower in fear to a very small spider, and run like mad from a very large one. I would in this situation maybe emote the fact that I have wet my pants at the sight of the large spider, or start shaking in fear, or something to that effect.
<br><br>
As for trying to role-play something that you are not, a high level wizard stuck in a newbie's body, you are on your own there. I would suggest waiting to figure out who and what you want your character to be. If you want it to be believable you must start from scratch in each world. Learn your surroundings, deities, pc's, npc's, and most importantly your race and class. This will help in creating a better role-playing atmosphere for not only you, but also those around you.
<br><br>
I know that I will probably have to rethink my backgrounds for Norrath. They have released so little on actual content of deities, starting points for characters, racial hostilities, warring factions, and even the complete history of Norrath. It will all be a new adventure for us. If 989 delivers, which I have HUGE faith in, we will have the canvas to paint the next Mona Lisa.

Thanks for sending in a question, and to all reading this, make sure to submit something cause we are getting thin on topics.
