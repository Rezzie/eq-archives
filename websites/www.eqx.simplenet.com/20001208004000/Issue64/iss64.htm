    Freygar entered Surefall at a dead run.   The place looked normal, its peace and quiet undisturbed by the turmoil outside.  Three Rangers guarding the entrance sheathed swords and relaxed half-drawn bows as they recognized him and his companion.  Morna glanced quickly around.
<br><br>
   "Let's go to the Great Tree."  She was already in motion.

Fineous yawned and stretched, the hides of his bed creaking as he turned to sit on its edge.  Standing and scratching his stomach, he walked over and pulled the skin aside from the window.  The morning sun shone in from the deserts of Ro, painfully bright on his hungover eyes.
<br><br>
Growling and covering the window again, he walked over to his bed, picked up his leathers and put them on awkwardly, hopping on one foot and falling back onto his bed pulling his boots on.  Standing again, clomping his boots into place, he turned and walked towards his dresser and picked up his belts.

"Don't think you're having all the fun, you know me; I hate everyone."<br>

<br><br>
	Following on the tail of Oghma's <a href="../Issue61/religion1.htm">article</a> on role playing and religion based on the Dark Elves, I wanted to add on some role playing tips for dark elves. I want to extend thanks to various people on the net who have written similar documents on role playing like Amoroth, the guys over at EverWorld, Ayrent the Drunken Cleric of Old, the guys here at EQX and all the rest; you know who you are.

	Richelieu sat and thought. The small home he shared with his mother seemed especially squalid now. His mother lay on the bed, fevered and sweating. She had been stricken by the mysterious disease sweeping through Qeynos, which even clerics could not cure. Or rather, could not cure cheaply, since the components require were extremely expensive, and a luxury only for the wealthy. A luxury that he and his mother could not afford.

Hey I like Robert Jordan's series! hehe.  
<br><br>
It never seizes to amaze me how accurately you can nail a subject to the
wall and rip it wide ass open with your <a href="../Issue63/edita.htm">editorials</a>.  Just wanted to
congratulate you on another great issue.

<em>I've heard there is to be a PVP only server in the upcoming phase 4 beta.  Why is it that the pleas of serious roleplayers go unheeded when they ask for a server for only roleplayers?  I think an all RP server would be incredibly popular and not much more difficult to accomplish than the PVP server which seems a sure thing.  Tell me is the PVP lobby so powerful, or merely more persistent?
