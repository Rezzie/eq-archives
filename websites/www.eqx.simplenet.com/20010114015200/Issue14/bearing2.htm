It would appear the Kevan is as unhappy about the down time as anyone.  But his point is interesting.  It could easily be pointed out that at any given time it is probably true that you CAN access at least one UO server…
<br><br>
<em>…, if you have any questions about UO, I am and have been a player since its public release.
<br><br>
First, server crashes seem to me to be infrequent (as in, not a daily event), but the servers are taken down
for maybe 20-30 minutes each day at a set time (about 11:30am) for daily maintenance and updates if any. I'm not sure whether they are all taken down at once or not.
Crashes and lag have been greatly improved. I don't think they can ever be fixed entirely…

I was surprised by the lack of responses much stronger than Marks.  I had expected a lot more of you to rave at me about the down time.  The strongest was from Tony:
<br><br>
<em>I cant give you numbers but this was a problem, along with time warps. The
week I quit I logged in 4 times. I wanted to go from Yew to Moonglow (not far). Each time I made
it to Moonglow which took ages due to lag, the server crashed. When I logged in the next day I
was back in Yew. This was in early Feb. That is not my idea of fun, it is meant to be fun is it??</em>

And that seems to be the key.  My opinion: people are unhappy that the game was overly lagged, and too unavailable due to server down time.  That’s understandable.  But did Origin and EA break any promises when they told us on the box that the game would be available 24/7?  In spirit I would say yes.  Even beyond what I would expect as down time for any major game like this.
