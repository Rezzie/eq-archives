<br><br><br>
<em><b> January 12th</em> -- Tunariat</b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druids and some rangers go out to the woods at dusk in full dress uniform, come back next morning in togas smelling like kalish.
<br><br>
<em><b> January 16th</em> -- Antonium</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Antonius Bayle's birthday.  He wants a pet Mist Wolf and a Dragoon Dirk this year.
<br><br>
<em><b> January 29th</em> -- Winter Carnival</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Trolls and Ogres meet between their cities for a day of barshing and other good, clean fun.
<br><br>
<em><b> February 1st</em> -- The Day When It's Gol-Darned Cold</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is an aptly-named Halasian holiday.  Called by various other, more profane names.
<br><br>
<em><b> February 10th</em> - March 30th (31st on a leap year) -- Pregiostirórshipoor</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Roughly translated, this means "Plant stuff and watch it grow."   This period in the calendars of the equatorial Humans and Fay Elves is one of planting stuff and watching it grow.
<br><br>
<em><b> February 29th</em> -- Leapies</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  According to the philosophies of the Small Folk, whatever they do on February 29th never actually happens.  Amazingly, on March 1st, the dead are resurrected, beer consumed is found undrunken, and short people everywhere are found sober in their beds.
<br><br>
<em><b> March 4th</em> -- Bristlebain's Birthday</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Arbitrary date, but a lot of fun all over Norrath.  Festivals and games are generally held in Ak'Anon, Freeport, Rivervale, and Qeynos.
<br><br>
<em><b> April 9th</em> -- Dwarvish New Year</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Celebrating the birthday of King Hardtoe II six hundred years ago, this Dwarvish holiday is a day of prayer, giving thanks, and, of course, heavy drinking.
<br><br>
<em><b> Third Monday in April</em> -- Pranksgiving</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This Gnomish holiday is practiced in Rivervale as "Laughing Day." Anyone over two feet tall is tripped, pied, or whoopee-cushioned at the first opportunity.
<br><br>
<em><b> April 12th</em> -- First Brew</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The first Dwarvish beer of the year is uncasked and served in a disorderly ceremony at the palace of Kaladim.
<br><br>
<em><b> April 30th</em> -- Grobbmugakh</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The main festival in Grobb, consisting of barshing.  This is well-placed in the spring, as it keeps the local froglok population down for the year...
<br><br>
<em><b> May 10th</em> -- Halfling New Year</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  With the first Jumjum harvest comes a week of revelry which no one seems to be able to remember for the rest of the year...
<br><br>
<em><b> May 10th</em> -- Gayosh Charabin</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Falling on the same day as the Halfling New Year, this human holiday is one of prayer and devotion for Paladins.
<br><br>
<em><b> First Thursday in June</em> -- Festival of Lights</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is the day when Neriak pulls out all the stops.  The city is aglow with sigils of evil, pain, hatred, and death as citizens shop, duel, and, of course, get drunk.  Alcohol, it seems, is the great bond between all cultures of Norrath, good and evil alike.
<br><br>
<em><b> June 19th</em> -- Cleric's Holiday</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For clerics, this is a day off from heals, a day off from buffs: a day off from work.  Other classes, bring your potions.
<br><br>
<em><b> June 24th</em> -- Midsummer Sweat</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The inhabitants of the humid Faydark recognize this as a day of rest. Even the guards go off duty, as the overweight orcs cannot run all the way to Kelethin in the intolerable heat.  (However, no one seems to notice their absence...)
<br><br>
<em><b> July 10th</em> -- Norrath Day</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Encouraged by the people of Surefall Glade and approved -- due to their lobbying -- by Antonius Bayle, Norrathians are expected to plant trees, nourish nature, and kiss the bears.  (The latter is mainly aimed at poachers.)  Faydarkers, Kithicans, and Halasians take the day off, but most other races, particularly the wood-squandering Halflings, are encouraged to participate.
<br><br>
<em><b> August 7th</em> -- Summer Sacrifice</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A day not to visit Neriak.
<br><br>
<em><b> August 9th</em> -- Jumjum Day</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The day marking the discovery of the mystical plant Jumjum in the year 2123.
<br><br>
<em><b> August 10th</em> -- Deputy Day</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The day marking the creation of the Rivervale Militia in the year 2123. On this day was the traditional Deputy uniform inaugurated.
<br><br>
<em><b> August 16th</em> -- Shilososhi's Birthday</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Mark your calendars.
<br><br>
<em><b> October 1-7th</em> -- Dark Elf Daze</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A Neriak festival of wine, games, and sacrifice to Innoruuk.  Ends with the Great Gnome Toss.
<br><br>
<em><b> October 29th</em> -- Erud's Day</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Celebrates the arrival of Erud in Odus.  Erudites are encouraged to meditate, write, and display their spellcraft.
<br><br>
<em><b> November 1st</em> -- Crushbone Day</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Every Wood Elf in Kelethin gets smashed, then sprints to Crushbone.  Much fun is had by both sides.
<br><br>
<em><b> November 9-19</em> -- Depression Daze</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A typical Halasian holiday full of drinking to forget the coming Winter.  Bars all over Norrath are packed with sulking Barbarians, moaning about the coming "Starving Time."  To the bartenders of nearby Qeynos, this is a good source of income, but the constant complaining in the middle of Antonica's Breadbasket tends to get on other patrons' nerves.
<br><br>
<em><b> December 23rd</em> -- Fay's Eve</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Preparation for Fayday in the Faydark.
<br><br>
<em><b> December 24th</em> -- Fayday</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The darkest day of the year, so it's just about pitch black in the Faydark.  Despite multiple accidents in Kelethin in the last few years, drinking and revelry are encouraged.  Torches are lit all over town, and, at midnight, a torch-bearing procession of Tunare's children makes its way along the paths through the Faydark, lighting up the forest like midsummer.
<br><br>
<em><b> December 26th</em> -- Boxing Day</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Even in Norrath, no one's sure what to do on Boxing Day.
<br><br>
<em><b> December 31st - January 1st</em></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is an important date, but no one quite remembers why.
