Nestled away in the quietest corner of the mid-eastern Antonican countryside lay the woods of Kithicor, a dimly lit and mostly undisturbed retreat. For generations peace-loving families mostly kin to the Karana Farmers made their cabins here, living off the abundant food and game to be found in the woods. As with all cultures, none are without their troubled times, but the people of Kithicor were until recently doing quite well. Despite the recent traffic of high-profile adventurers serving the needs of the Kithicor Rangers and Druids, the end of peaceful times has come.
<br><br>
	Without warning one evening an incredible army of the living dead set march upon the woods, killing everyone in sight and cutting off one of the largest and most vital supply roads in all of Norrath. The Rivervale patrols are now prisoners of their own city, unable to leave without being unceremoniously slain on the roads right outside of town. Blacksmiths and trades-folk bound for the west coast are now seeking shelter in the common lands, waiting for a sign of hope and safe passage even as the Freeport Militia stands by powerless.  Even the unquestionably dominant strength of Carson McCabe's High Hold mercenaries could do nothing more than call for help. The army of undead hold the pass unchallenged.
<br><br>
	As a young ranger still learning my trade, I have often tended to the wounded and weary traveling into the Karanas who need shelter. I had personally been into the woods a few times during the day months ago, and saw nothing uncommon. Other travelers often told tales of strange or even horrible things, but recently the news of the undead army told only atrocity. Finally one cold evening I met with a very old friend of mine who was willing to bring some possible insight to the recent happenings. 
<br><br>
	Kipp Goodleaf has served as a humble priest to Bristlebane for longer than I can remember, and is fond of travel and good food. It was at the table eating one of his favorite meals, thunderhoof mushroom soup, that he shared with me his story. Kipp insisted that the trouble was far from without warning and that the Rangers of Kithicor should have left the woods moons ago after a particular turn of events, which he wouldn't explain until later that night. 
<br><br>
	Most travelers knew of the tribe of orcs that made home to Kithicor and High Pass, but not that many had ever thought of the ruined lodges near the lake. In fact, while most travelers were aware there was a lake, most claimed to have avoided going near it as if the gods willed them to avoid it. Even the Rangers and Druids avoid the lake. Careful inspection of the burnt ruins shows what used to be the largest gathering of cabins and homes, all burnt and ruined. Even during the shaded day, patrols reported distant sightings of undead lurking about the ruins. 
<br><br>
	Several different myths were born in these sightings, Kipp explained. Most believed that the spirits of those who lived in the homes and cabins haunted the ruins, which must have been destroyed by the orc tribe. Others suspected a curse, which was the more popular myth as the orcs rarely threatened the trade route. No matter the myth, the Paladins of Mithaniel Marr held dominion over the ruins, slaying any undead strong enough to leave the lake.
<br><br>
	A few moons ago something had changed, Kipp continued. One of the prominent leaders of the Ranger community was informed of the increased reports of Necromancers and Shadow Knights near High Hold. These minions of the Plaguebringer showed interest in property in the Kithicor woods, and began to threaten the trade routes at various points in time. At about this time, a rather powerful and elusive ghoul rogue escaped the watchful eyes of Mithaniel's finest and made off with a strategic map of High Pass and the greater Kithicor area. This ghoulish minion was soon after spotted moving with the speed of the dead towards the leader of the Shadow Knight regime in South Karana. 
<br><br>
	Kipp sighed over his mead, calling the Rangers fools for not having foreseen disaster. Although a weighty bounty was placed on the safe return of the map, and many Paladins and Rangers hunted the ghoul down, eventually the map must have been delivered to its unholy destination. Even the Rivervale patrol have in their records personal witness to the slaying of the rogue ghoul, the map somehow always managed to disappear before it could be secured away or destroyed. Magic darker than anything known was at work, and the curse descended on the woods.
<br><br>
	Kipp grew silent, and then admitted that he could only guess what happened after that. The fate of Kithicor had been sealed and the dominion of Mithaniel Marr was no more. Dusk fell on the hopes of all that live near there. Although the High Pass Guard expected the threat would pass from the West into the woods, nary a bare boned skeleton was seen anywhere near the pass. The Commons Militia swore that they were acutely aware of the number of undead in the region, and no such army had marched through either. Like a midnight tempest the forces of evil rained down on the woods, or perhaps sprung up like weeds.
<br><br>
	Now those high-profile adventurers lucky enough to escape often carried their peers covered in white sheets. Seasoned veterans of many wars stood weary along side exhausted masters of the arcane, all waiting for attention from sleepless apothecaries and healers. The OutRiders of Karana who had for so long watched the Plaguebringers from afar, testified that never had they seen even the most powerful of the Necromancers command so much power. A Dwarven strong arm called to fight against the new foe proclaimed that even the horrors of the Unrest Estate were pale compared to the brute power these new foes hold. It was as if a dark god had set foot upon the land himself. 
<br><br>
	We drank silently at the table and watched sun set behind the heavy clouds. I could not shake the unanswered questions in my mind, as to why undead would be in Kithicor, or what the Plaguebringer's minions wanted there. I asked my companion, and was replied by a regretful sigh. Kipp reflected back to the ruins at the lake. The same questions were asked then and should have been answered, but the truth lay shrouded in mystery and fear. Kipp remembered Kithicor had always been as it was, a place where peaceful non-militant farmers and druids led out their lives. Sadly not much was even known about how the cabins came to burn down, or the people to die or disappear. Those who might have known have never revealed it.
<br><br>
	Curiously enough, strange happenings in the greater Kithicor region weren't unheard of even before the lake cabins were shrouded in darkness, Kipp commented. He remembered as a youth when Counsels from the Erudin Palace would visit Rivervale, asking strange questions and looking for obscure historical doctrines, many related to Kithicor's wildlife, history and the lake itself. Most of them were incredibly reluctant to answer questions asked of them in return, except for one young Erudite woman of questionable disposition. She had told Kipp's elder they searched for traces leading to the location of lost or stolen artifacts dating to the dawn of the magical era, long before the age of the Great Combine. This particular woman spoke of one called Miragul.
<br><br>
	Slowly I started to see a possibility. I had heard this name before at a fireside outing with the OutRiders of Karana, in what most today would dismiss as a ghost story. Had not Miragul, the dreaded father of all that is necromancy today, also spent an incredible amount of time near the lake and Rivervale itself? We both would ponder the coincidence in uneasy solitude. Silence returned to the table, and our mugs had gone dry.
<br><br>
	As I bade good night to my friend and closed the barn for the night, I watched the clouds approach. One by one the moans of the wounded travelers silenced in sleep, and in the distance the wolves could be heard keeping vigil. As I collected these thoughts onto parchment, I pondered my own existence and freedom. Many brave men and women went into the pass to defend what they believe in and not as many had returned. We share tales of heroism and valor, and of battles won.  Looking at the silhouette of the oldest trees still alive against the night sky, I wondered what other battles had been fought, lost, and forgotten. Where would we find the heroes of today? With that last chilling thought the heavy rain fell, sounding off a deep roll of thunder. The storm was coming.
