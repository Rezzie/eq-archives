<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
  Train Stops Here</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Well, I went and 
  did it. Yup. Count me among the disenfranchised who yearn for a new game to 
  play.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I cancelled my 
  EverQuest Account on Thursday evening.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It&#146;s not to 
  say that it was a bad game. I think my reverence for this groundbreaking game 
  comes through in the article below. But if it had been an exceptional game, 
  I think I&#146;d still be playing. I think my articles show that I haven&#146;t 
  been playing much, as they&#146;ve begun to slant toward general role-playing 
  topics rather than remaining in the realm of Norrath.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I notice that there 
  are stages to virtual life. I will exclude the step wherein one writes for an 
  EverQuest online newspaper for a year before the game even goes into beta.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) Awe. First time 
  you log in, there&#146;s a real sense of wonder. It&#146;s even a little overwhelming 
  to think that you can pick a direction and go.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) Frustration. 
  As any newbie can attest, you have those moments where you wonder why you are 
  bothering to play. Typically those moments are preceded by &#147;A Kliknik prince 
  attacks you for 5 pts of damage&#148; and is immediately followed by &#147;Returning 
  to home&#148;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) Satisfaction. 
  When you finally achieve a few quests and a friend or two have shown you a few 
  pointers, you have that soft warm glow of contentedness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4) Exhaustion. 
  Pretty soon you are logging on for many, many hours. I&#146;m not sure I was 
  ever as addicted to EverQuest as I was to the predecessor to this game, Tanarus. 
  But it&#146;s pretty close.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5) Fear. Eventually 
  you start hitting areas where more often than not you wind up running for your 
  virtual life. Even as you sit there in your chair in a well-lit room tapping 
  the keys like a madman, bag of Salsa Verde Doritos and a Big Gulp of Dr. Pepper 
  on the table beside you, you still feel the adrenaline rush of a man/woman in 
  true despair as you do your best to amble your mortally wounded character into 
  the nearest zone whilst the griffin tears away large hunks of your virtual backside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6) Boredom. It 
  happens with the best of games. You hit a plateau. For some it&#146;s 5th or 
  6th level (as with a friend who left the game when beta ended) while for others 
  it&#146;s when they reach 50th level and there&#146;s nothing left to challenge 
  them. For me, it was level 16. I could have kept going if I cared any longer 
  about the game at that point, but I had been playing since late in the first 
  stage of beta&#133; repeating my efforts as I tried out the various races and 
  classes and rebuilt through numerous character wipes. When my 15th level character 
  at the end of beta was wiped, I figured I&#146;d never bother to play long enough 
  to top that. Well, I played numerous characters, but I only bothered to push 
  one to 16th. Admittedly, for a guy writing articles on gaming, 16th level is 
  pretty low achievement, but achievement was never my goal so much as enjoyment. 
  For me they are not irrevocably linked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7) Longing. I so 
  wanted to keep playing and to feel the fire again. Friends had told me that 
  they stopped playing for a few weeks and when they came back their interest 
  in the game had been redoubled. For me, it was the opposite. I found other things 
  to do. Pretty soon, I knew the time had come.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8) Cancellation. 
  I can&#146;t explain why this was so hard to do. Maybe because of EQX and the 
  need to keep attached to the game in some remote way so that I could continue 
  to write articles. But it&#146;s more likely that, as with Tanarus before it, 
  EverQuest was still an ideal whose prime had passed for me. Logging in was no 
  longer a joy. New patches only drew a sigh rather than the giddy anticipation 
  of fixes to the game.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9) Is there a stage 
  nine? Maybe there is. Could be that some day I so miss the game that I log back 
  on, but it&#146;s unlikely. I&#146;ll just miss some of the players.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this day and 
  age of Norrath, everyone seems to be 40th level. The newbie-lands are bereft 
  of wanderers. The once crowded low-level dungeons are now plentiful and ready 
  to be plundered. But the buzz is not the same.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So what will I 
  do with my time?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lil&#146; Archy 
  came to a very unceremonious halt. After more than a year of cartoon strips, 
  I&#146;m nearly bereft of ideas. I may just let Archy, Snaffu, Oghlin the dwarven 
  bard, The generic PK d00d, Torchy the Fire Elemental, and the rest of the cast 
  stay in limbo&#133; much like the characters I left behind in the game when 
  I terminated my account.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I find Ezmend, 
  my highest level character, still pre-occupies my thoughts on rare occasion. 
  Perhaps he&#146;ll find his way into a paper &amp; pen RPG, should we ever create 
  an evil party.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I had sat down 
  to write this article thinking that it would be about how things might have 
  been better in the game, or what might have happened to keep me playing. But 
  at this point I&#146;ve spilled all my suggestions into previous articles, and 
  all that comes out here are the fond feelings of remembrance of a bunch of lives 
  I never really lived. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But let&#146;s 
  be less maudlin in ending this article. I think here I&#146;ll include the things 
  that I think would make a perfect role-playing game. Let&#146;s assume for a 
  minute that developers had all the time, wealth, and capability to implement 
  my suggestions. I&#146;ll make my suggestions based on this premise.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Individuality. 
    What many games (especially online games) lack is the ability to set yourself 
    apart from others. The developers of 3rd Edition D&amp;D (Wizards of the Coast) 
    appear to be making their game so that you have more choices for your character. 
    Your new fighter might not wind up with exactly the same abilities as your 
    last fighter or the one you made a decade ago. Being able to better select 
    one&#146;s abilities would be a great addition to online RPGs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Appearance. 
    Asheron&#146;s Call has made an attempt to allow you to customize the appearance 
    of your characters. In EQ, all body types were the same in each race. The 
    faces were rarely seen up close and therefore everyone looked nearly the same. 
    Clothes were the same. It&#146;s hard to get into character when you are basically 
    playing Generic character number 1791 on your server.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GM Intervention. 
    Events in EQ were always so few and far between. And I was never online when 
    they happened. The Neverwinter Nights model of having a GM for every group 
    of players seems appealing. Unrealistic in a game like EverQuest, but then 
    we are &#147;shooting the moon&#148; here.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Graphical improvements. 
    This is the kind of thing that will happen. With time, every game will have 
    a less &#147;box-like&#148; look to the figures. This is the one item that 
    I&#146;m relatively sure will happen in the very near future.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Less Abuse. 
    I speak of players abusing players and of players abusing flaws in the game. 
    Verant has always endeavored to make a level playing field. It&#146;s the 
    players who have always done their best to get ahead by whatever means possible. 
    And for a &#147;game&#148;, that&#146;s pretty sad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> No Character 
    Selling. As nice as it is for someone who doesn&#146;t have the time to build 
    up a high level character to buy one and jump right in, it&#146;s detrimental 
    to the game in terms of all the useful items being camped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Simple Interface. 
    That&#146;s not to say that EQ had a tough interface, because it didn&#146;t. 
    But the trend in computer games is to keep adding hotkeys. I don&#146;t know 
    about you, but I&#146;m intimidated by any game where they have to include 
    a picture of the keyboard with all of the actions mapped on it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Scalable starting. 
    I&#146;ve been thinking about how people with little time to play never get 
    to see much of the world. In a game like Neverwinter Nights, theoretically 
    you&#146;ll see anything the GM wants you to see. With EQ however, you are 
    stuck at low level unless you *gasp* buy a character. One way around this 
    would be to allow players to start at a higher level. They wouldn&#146;t get 
    all sorts of amazing equipment or anything&#133; just the capability to go 
    out and get it themselves, just like when you start off at first level. There 
    may/may not be bonuses of some kind for starting out from the beginning. Maybe 
    there&#146;s a skill that you can gain at first and fifth and tenth levels 
    (etc.) that you can&#146;t get by starting out at tenth. In order for this 
    to work there would have to be great restrictions on what equipment can be 
    passed around and who can group up, otherwise you&#146;d have somebody make 
    a 15th level character so he can gather equipment and money for his first 
    level friends. But if you were unable to pass anything except, say&#133; food, 
    and merchants would not buy food from player characters then you can get some 
    mileage out of this idea.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There, now I feel 
  like I&#146;ve done something productive rather than just writing a tearful 
  goodbye to the game I&#146;ve played for&#133; how long? I&#146;ve sat in front 
  of a computer for how many hours? Jeez. I really do need a life. Think I&#146;ll 
  see how much they go for on E-bay.</font></p>
