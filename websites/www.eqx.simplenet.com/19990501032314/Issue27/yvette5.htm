The room was filled with the smell of freshly turned dirt. The three figures
stood without speaking for a long while, illuminated by the only window high
at the top of the underground chamber. Yvette regarded the other two with
curiosity, never having met a group of such well calculating mercenaries
before. The first was a very short animated fellow with frilly gray hair and
a large blunt nose. He had been fidgeting with a loose gear from his sailors
navigation tool for some time, and usually only stopped to take a sample from
his pipe or to breath loudly through his nose. He had blasphemous tattoos
belonging to the Duke Below, which would probably not be a welcome site in
Kaladim these days.

The other figure seemed to try and fade into the air as he stood there, the
only movement at all from him was his luxurious swaying white mane of hair.
Occasionally Yvette could feel his eyes devouring her, and her skin crawled
when he would move near her. His blue ebon skin and deep feline voice
betrayed him as a predator. He had a name for himself as a witch killer,
and even his peers feared him. However, he was the most qualified for the
gruesome task ahead.

The three waited for the last of the mercenaries, he who would return for the
treasure buried on the beach. They stood around a wooden crate with the
gnome's map on it, looking at the pin points of error and trial ahead of
them. Yvette could count on the Holy Templars of Qeynos to stir up a virtual
army of zealots, led by the skilled hunters of Karana. They had to chose between
two paths of escape and would draw a conclusion in a moment once the third
had arrived.
