<em>Player driven events. GM's should definitely run RP events, but do the players have a similar obligation to improve the whole community?  Should guilds in particular host such events?  Dare I even ask if this should be a requirement for recognized guild standing in EQ?

	Looking at online role playing games as we know it, how much GM intervention is required in an event? Thinking back on the events I have seen or heard about I cannot think of very many that required GM attention. Weddings, Jousts and melee contests, funerals, costume parties, fairs. They can all be run pretty smoothly without GM assistance. The only better thing is that we will have the switch to keep these activities from being disrupted by player killers.
<br><br>
	Where is a guilds place in running events? This is a topic I can enjoy. I disagree that it should be required, although it suffices to say that those guilds that do participate in events and other community activities will probably succeed in areas other guilds might fail. A lot of guilds are just there to provide players with common interests to be together, which is fine and healthy. However, those guilds that make a habit out of running or helping with player events will gain more attention, recruits and probably fame.
<br><br>
	Looking at the FAQ, it says that quests may be tailored for the most successful or largest guilds. If <b>I</b> had to measure the success of a guild next to a peer, I would factor in what they had done for the online community other than selfish needs and goals. Such activities could include almost anything, and as a guild leader I would look at what the community wants or needs that is not a normal part of the gaming experience. It would make sense that a player run event would be one that could not normally happen without precise planning and organization. Well duh you say, but my point is to look at see how a guild is better suited to run such an event than a group of non-aligned players.
<br><br>
	It would be fairly difficult for a single player to gather the volume of players it takes to make an event fun. Sure, one man can come up with the idea but he is best suited to look to guilds as a major source of audience. As a note, there are other "groups" of players to appeal to other than guilds, such as regular patrons of a specific fan site, chat room or media group (like EQX). 
<br><br>
	The line that can sometimes be drawn between chat buddies and a guild is one of roleplaying, as groups of fans might not play the same race or have the same goals as each other, while guilds should always have a binding role. This may or may not have an effect on player run events as some of them do not have a bearing on roleplaying at all, like oh say; a all-racial festival where trolls and halflings share beer.
<br><br>
	Without knowing the specific mechanics of the game, it will be hard to tell what kind of events we will be able to run on our own as players. A lot of time the cost for setting up an event can come out of the pockets of the organizers, which is another reason guilds would excel at running such events.
<br><br>
	In closing, as an answer to the readers question, it can be safely said that guilds who run events such as newbie armor drives, moderated duel and PvP "capture the flag" games and contests and item auctions will gain more attention than those that do not. I do not expect a huge amount of participation from GMs, as it would not be necessary. Now then, that is not to say they will not show up to have fun. =)
