Well it's been a while since I prattled about PC games.  I'm ready to report on a few of the latest games I've been playing.  If you're bored and want something to spice up your PC, go check these out!
<br><br><br>
<b><big>Populous:  The Beginning</big></b>
<br><br>
<b>Publisher:</b> EA <b>Developer:</b> Bullfrog
<br><br>
A few days ago I downloaded the demo for "Populous: The Beginning".  After playing over twenty hours all I can say is WOW!  For those of you that never played Populous, this is the third installment, and it just rocks!  In this episode you play the role of a Shaman.  You build buildings to breed villagers and create warriors and priests who carry out your orders.  So it sounds like your typical Settlers, or Ages of the Empire?  WRONG!!  The Beginning puts you in a total 3D environment!  The special effects, especially with magic, are just incredible.  My personal favorite is to unleash a huge tornado and watch it rip though an enemies village, destroying everything in its path.  Like out of the movie "Twister" buildings just rip apart, board by board, and get sucked into the funnel.   There are tons of cool 3D views to choose from to watch this action take place.
<br><br>
The Beginning has all the right features including network play for four, and even a web page to link up with other players for free.

<big><b>World War II Europe</b></big>
<br><br>
<b>Publisher:</b> Jane's Combat Simulations <b>Developer:</b> Jane's Combat Simulations
<br><br>
The skies above World War II Europe come alive with Jane's WWII Fighters. Fly the seven best fighters of the war in the most graphically intense flight simulation developed to date, with unprecedented special effects, terrain, and aircraft detail. Designed for simulation fans of all levels, the game contains training missions and variable difficulty levels for the novice, as well as a branching campaign, realistic flight dynamics, and sophisticated AI for the hard core gamer. With a collection of actual WW II footage and interviews with several real WW II aces, this game delivers the most complete air combat experience available on PC. - <em>ICN-PC</em>.
<br><br>
Well if you have patients to download 56MB (or have a cable modem!) this has got to be the GREATEST WWII flight simulator I have ever played.  I have had a blast playing this one, and fully intend on buying this one and adding to my collection of flight sims.  You really get a feel for the control of the plane, with the games wonderful flight dynamics.  The AI has to be one of the best I've ever seen with any flight sim!   The only complaint I have is I only have two machines I can run it on!  This game takes a hell-of-a-machine to keep up with it.
<br><br>
<b>Requirements: Pentium 200, 32 MB RAM, 3D graphics accelerator required. Must be compatible with: Glide 2.43 (Voodoo I and Voodoo Rush); Glide 2.5 (Voodoo II); or Direct3D.  (OUCH!)</b>
<br><br><br>
<big><b>Baldur's Gate</b></big>
<br><br>
<b>Publisher:</b> Interplay <b>Developer:</b> Bioware
<br><br>
Man-o-man where the hell is this game!!  This game is going to make Diablo look like PAC MAN.
<br><br>
Well of course I have not played this game yet, as there is no way in hell they could create a downloadable demo for this monster, but here is a great review from Jason at IGN-PC who did get to play :P

As I have said many times, one of my favorite things to do to pass time is read PC Game news on the Web.  One thing I've found, that most of these sites do is rip a game apart if the author wasn't interested in that type of game.  If you don't like playing RPG's then don't review them!  You're wasting everyone's time!  So with that said, and your sick of wasting time reading prejudice opinions on games, then I have a site for you.  Trent Ward (Editor-and-Cheese) and Jason Bates (Not related to Norman Bates) do most of the reviews.  Let me tell you these guys not only do a great job reviewing each upcoming title, they are funny as hell too!  I really enjoy reading the site, which I might add changes daily!
<br><br>
Oh and these guys love to get feedback from readers, so go check them out and tell them what a kick-ass site they have!
