Hoi there! Lrets D'pearl here once again here in comfy ol' RiverVale to give ye the latest on the opening of what promises to be a very successful chain of entertainment restaurants. What started as a little mom and pop operated tavern that offered the occasional visit by certain well known bards has now exploded into the mega successful chain of Hard Waltz Cafe's across the lands of Norrath. And yes ... through popular demand a restaurant has finally opened in RiverVale. 
<br><br>

(<em>This restaurant follows in the theme of all Hard Waltz Cafe's and displays the trademark "Petrified Bears imbedded into the walls" decor prominently displayed over the entrance</em>)
<br><br>
The whole concept for the Hard Waltz Cafes started off when 2 married, retired bards decided to open a tavern where people could come and enjoy a quality meal AND have entertaining music played by the "hot" bards of the time. This whole idea literally took off over night, and blasted the happy couple into unprecedented success. With the opening of the first Hard Waltz Cafe in Qeynos, the stream of people into the restaurant was non-stop. Thus prompting the opening of more restaurants across Norrath. Currently there are restaurants in Qeynos, Erud, and now RiverVale; with construction on a fourth currently underway on the Northern edge of the Desert of Ro.

(<em>Construction of the Freeport/Desert Ro restaurant is already underway and will display more of the fauna common to that area ... instead of the bears we have grown so accustomed to seeing</em>) 
<br><br>
As stated ... the restaurants are now reputed to host some of the hottest bards to have graced the ears of listeners across Norrath. In fact, not being ones to detract from their pattern, it is rumored that the owners of Hard Waltz have contracted with none other than Bard Jythri to play at the opening of the RiverVale restaurant. Furthermore, it is believed that Jythri may also donate a signed Mahoganey Fyn'der Straut Mandolin to be showcased inside the restaurant (Another trademark move of Hard Waltz's -- displaying signed instruments of famous bards .. including AHEM!!! :) One particular roaming freelance reporter's in the Qeynos restaurant ... <em>right by the razorgill tanks near the west wall -- if'n ye really MUST know</em>) :P 
<br><br>
So .. don't eat breakfast or lunch today and prepare yourselves for one ROCKIN' evening as the RiverVale branch of the Hard Waltz Cafe's chain of restaurants opens tonight to the slammin' errrr .... Hard Waltzin' tunes of Jythri the Bard. This will be a night not soon to be forgotten! 
<br><br>
This is Lrets D'pearl Aspiring Bard Extraordinaire and Freelance Reporter who's gonna party his knocker off at Hard Waltz's tonight .. signing off until next time! :)
