"I'm hot, Uncle," mumbled Janell, stripping off her bear skin cloak.
<br><br>
"Shhhh!  We're hunting here, and your whining'll draw attention t'us…and dinnae call me Uncle." Angaram's harsh whisper barely audible over the sound of the tall grasses blowing in the winds.  The dwarf turned back to his vigil, crouched on the back side of a hill, gazing out over the broad expanse of the plains of Karanas.
<br><br>
Janell pulled her jerkin off and rolled it up, leaving her light undertunic on and whispered, "Why are we here, Uncle?  All we've seen are bugs and bats…Oh, and that lion that about ate us alive."
<br><br>
Turning again, his expression overly patient, "Lion skins are VERY valuable and hard t'come by.  They'll get us a pretty copper, which we'll need t'pay off that bartender after your last escapade."
<br><br>
"I did not start that!" snapped the barbarian.  "He said something rude and pinched my behind.  Anyway, it wasn't that bad"
<br><br>
"Nae that bad?  You threw him out a window and into a tinker's cart!  Now be quiet!" and the dwarf turned once again to peek over the hill.  Pausing for a moment in his vigil, he turned to face his young companion and whispered quietly, "Umm….run."  Upon saying this, he took off through the grass away from the hill as fast as his stubby legs could carry him.
<br><br>
Not understanding, Janell turned to peek over the hill and came eye to eye with eight eyes…on the head of a spider easily as big as a draft horse.  
<br><br>
Screaming at the top of her lungs, she took off after her uncle, catching up with and passing him in four strides as the spider gave pursuit of its meal.  Hearing the sounds behind him, and realizing there was no way to outrun it, Angaram drew his sword, turned around, and braced himself.
<br><br>
The spider moved quickly across the ground, focusing in on the smaller, and therefore weaker prey in its mind.  As it closed on the dwarf, it stopped suddenly, noticing it's prey was no longer fleeing and had "bristled".  Circling cautiously, the huge spider suddenly reared back and leaped upon the tiny morsel.
<br><br>
Jumping aside, Angaram swept his sword sideways, slashing at and severing of the monster's legs, causing it to jump back and flinch, the severed member twitching.  Furious, the spider jumped again, only to receive another slice, this time to its body.
<br><br>
Janell had turned to see how far ahead she was when she noticed that no one was chasing her.  Seeing her uncle fighting the thing, she pulled her two-handed sword and charged into the fray to rescue him.  Unable to flee, the spider continued its assault but was quickly vanquished.
<br><br>
As the two stood over the still carcass, Janell turned and asked "But uncle, I thought you hated spiders?"
<br><br>
The look Angaram gave his "niece" would have withered dirt.  He then turned and strode off to his hill top perch to continue his hunting.
<br><br>
After an hour or so, Janell spotted something on the horizon.  Pointing it out, she asked the dwarf what it was.
<br><br>
"Cyclops," the dwarf said quietly.
<br><br>
"Oooh!  Why aren't we going after it?" the young barbarian asked.
<br><br>
"Because it would pick me up, put it's lips t'my arse, and blow me like a party favour.  That's why." And he continued his search.
<br><br>
Janell paused, trying to visualize that particular image, then chuckled and turned her eyes back to the horizon.  Soon she spotted a pack of wolves and brought them to the dwarf's attention.  Smiling and nodding, he began creeping through the tall grass, closing on what he saw as "hides on the paw".
<br><br>
Leaping from cover, the pair descended upon the wolves and proceeded to kill them quickly, being careful not to damage the hides.  Once they were all dead, Janell knelt and began skinning them while Angaram gathered the bodies and brought them to her.
<br><br>
"Well done," came a voice from behind them.  Turning, the pair spotted a Human, clad in leather from head to foot, crouched on the hill top, gazing down upon them.  His green eyes sparkled with mischief as a long sword rested across his legs.
<br><br>
"What do you want, brigand?" Angaram growled.
<br><br>
"Why, what every brigand wants, my hairy friend.  You two seem to be doing well, hunting in our territory.  I only hoped that you would share your wealth with us."
<br><br>
Janell bumped the dwarf's shoulder to get his attention, but he shrugged her off and said, "And why would I want to share anything with the likes o'you, thief?"
<br><br>
Janell nudged him harder, "Umm…Uncle?"
<br><br>
"What?  Cannae you see I'm busy…" Angaram's voice faded out as he turned to confront his companion and noticed another half dozen leather clad folk crouching in a semi-circle behind them.  He turned back to the first brigand and frowned at him.
<br><br>
"Because I'm bigger than you?" purred the thief.
<br><br>
"Harumph"
