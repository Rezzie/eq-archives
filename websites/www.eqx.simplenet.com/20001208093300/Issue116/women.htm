   "Hello, little bard," said Rosieda.  "Can you wear?"
<br><br>
   Can I wear what? I thought confusedly.
<br><br>
   I had just made my way to the gate of Qeynos, new guild tunic proudly displayed upon my torso and trusty - or was it rusty? - short sword clutched gingerly in my sweaty hand.  Well, to be completely accurate, I had just made my way back to the gate, having barely escaped a mean and vicious rat by reaching the protection of the stalwart Qeynos Guards.  I was sitting next to the wall, catching my breath, cursing buck-toothed rodents and all their ilk, and slowly healing, when this lovely vision of a ranger intruded into my reverie with her question.
<br><br>
   "Pardon me?" I said, looking up into dazzling eyes.
<br><br>
   "Can you wear?" Rosieda repeated, and held out a number of armor and jewelry items to me.
<br><br>
   Still confused, and not knowing what she intended, I answered, "I don't know.  I'm new here."
<br><br>
   "Just take them," she said.  So I did.
<br><br>
   Not knowing what else to say, I mumbled "Thanks very much."  Then I took a closer look at what she'd given me.
<br><br>
   When I fully comprehended her generosity, I donned the armor and the magical bracelets, earrings and necklace, and sought Rosieda out again.  This time I thanked her profusely.
<br><br>
   She merely smiled her dazzling smile and said, "Good hunting."
<br><br>
   Good hunting.  Yes, that's exactly what I intended.
<br><br>
   So, clad in the finery Rosieda had bestowed on me, I strode boldly - with sweating palms - out into the night, chanting "Here, ratty, ratty, ratty."

<br><br><br>
   Some say that the path of a man's life is shaped by the women he encounters along the way, from the midwife who wraps him in his first swaddling to the crone who sews his shroud.  Some change the path entirely, some are boon companions on the trail, and others provide mere pleasant scenery by the wayside.
<br><br>
   In the life of Kianel, Bard of Qeynos, Rosieda was one such woman.
<br><br>
   At the time of our first meeting, Rosieda had not yet attained her 20th season.  Now, newly married and named Invinsible, my first friend is in her 40th season.  She remains the fierce warrior woman with the generous heart.
<br><br>
   Still, to call the ranger Rosieda a warrior might rub some the wrong way . . . especially those who specialize in the fine art of inflicting bodily harm with blades and clubs and daggers and other sundry implements of mayhem.  To those, I apologize.  (To be sure, it's safer that way.)  However, for one such as myself who deals in the power and truly fine art of music, anyone who possesses a greater facility at dealing physical damage to the hostile denizens of fair Norrath qualifies as a warrior.
<br><br>
   And this is how I think of Rosieda Invinsible.
<br><br>
   Thus also do I think of Kandora the Kind, and of Teppeny the halfling, although each of the three is a unique personality.  (In the case of Teppeny, extremely unique.)

<br><br><br>

   I first met the ranger Kandora Whisperoak through another friend.
<br><br>
   I had recently achieved my seventh song, but nowhere in Qeynos could I find the sheet music for it. 
From fellow bards I had heard that a vendor in Kelethin always had this song in stock.  My friend, a beautiful young cleric, let slip that Kandora and her beloved husband Ismar were coming to Qeynos from Greater Faydark on a quest, and would be stopping in Kelethin on the way.
<br><br>
   A bashful bard is no bard at all, so summoning all my charm - and donning the charisma-enhancing necklace Rosieda had given me - I persuaded my cleric friend to intercede with Kandora on my behalf.  After all, I told myself, how could I pass up the chance to save myself a long and perilous trip?  A song is a light and airy thing, and no encumbrance at all.
<br><br>
   I doubted not that my friend would persuade Kandora to grant my wish.  Few women could even then resist my charms . . . even when exercised through an intermediary.
<br><br>
   Some days later, gold in hand, I met Kandora Whisperoak at the Qeynos gate.
<br><br>
   "Greeting, fair one," I said, flashing her my most charming smile.  "I trust your journey went well."
<br><br>
   Fair she was, although in sooth this mild flattery was more for my benefit than for hers.  (There is a kernel of truth in the statement, "A bard is but a rogue with a pretty face.")
<br><br>
   "Greeting, handsome bard," Kandora responded. "Aye, our trip was pleasant and uneventful."
<br><br>
   It was then I noticed what an imposing figure the enchanter Ismar Whisperoak cut in the flickering
torchlight.
<br><br>
   "Uh, please don't let me delay you any more than necessary," I hastily continued, "for I know you wish to complete your quest."
<br><br>
   I reached into my purse.  "I give my profound thanks for your aid, and I hope you will accept a token of my gratitude for your trouble.  Say, perhaps, an additional gold piece over the price of the song."
<br><br>
   Ismar cleared his throat.
<br><br>
   "Uh, make that five gold pieces," I quickly amended.
<br><br>
   I held out the coins to the radiant Kandora.
<br><br>
   Smiling knowingly, Kandora handed me my song.
<br><br>
   "Keep your gold, young bard," she said.  "I know what it's like to be young and without coin.  Save your gold for future songs.  And learn well your art, for Norrath needs the beauty and power of music to help counter the dark pall of evil in the land."
<br><br>
   Then I saw the lid of her eye on the side away from Ismar slowly close and just as slowly reopen.
<br><br>
   "And who knows," she added teasingly, "perhaps someday you will immortalize me in your songs and tales."
<br><br>
   Suddenly, an unfamiliar sensation washed through my body.  I felt a prickling heat in my face, and I could no longer meet Kandora's eye.  Without conscious thought, I found myself kneeling, head bent in humility before her.
<br><br>
   "Oh fair lady," I whispered hoarsely, for there was a tightness in my throat.  "You shame me with your kindness."
<br><br>
   Fumbling with my gloves, I pulled the rawhide covering from my right hand and from its third finger removed the slender silver ring, the only birthright I had from the human father I had never known.   "If you will not accept my gold," I begged, "please accept this ring as a true token of my esteem.  Its value is small, but I give it with all the gratitude of my heart."
<br><br>
   I held the shining circlet up to her beseechingly.
<br><br>
   Her teasing smile vanished, and I could see her eyes probing me intently, weighing my sincerity against my earlier behavior.  Then she slowly reached out and took my silver ring.  Holding it between the thumb and forefinger of her right hand, she lifted it up into the torchlight and gazed at the flickering reflections on its surface.
<br><br>
   "Some say," she said musingly, "that all bards lack wisdom, sacrificing it for charm and beauty."  She lowered her hand and looked once again at me.   "I think that, in time, you may prove those naysayers false."
<br><br>
   And she slipped my ring into her tunic, next to her heart.
<br><br>
   With a snort, Ismar extended his arm to his wife, and together they walked away through the Qeynos gate, a couple with the innate grace only true nobility can bring.  But as they passed through the entry, Ismar Whisperoak took one last glance back at me . . . and I will swear, he winked.
<br><br>
   Thus did I first meet Kandora the Kind, and from her learned an indelible lesson in goodness and nobility . . . and from her husband Ismar, a lesson in forbearance.
<br><br>
   It seems that friends of friends play a central role in my life.  In my youth, I had banded with Gallah, and although I soon lost touch with her in the immensity that is Norrath, not long after I met the exuberant Teppeny.
<br><br>
   Ah, Teppeny!  Diminutive in stature, but a presence which would fill the entire outdoors . . . which is only appropriate for a druid.
<br><br>
   One day I was running through the Qeynos Hills, on my way to Highkeep and thence to Rivervale, when a high-pitched, laughing voice hailed me.  Immediately ceasing my running, I turned about to see Teppeny, her broad smile reaching up to me from her position so much closer to the ground.
<br><br>
   "Hail and well met, Kianel!"  Her soprano voice seemed to fill the surrounding area with incredible lightness.  "Gallah sends her regards."
<br><br>
   "Gallah!" I exclaimed delightedly.  "I haven't seen her in a dragon's age.  Do you know her well?"
<br><br>
   "Like sisters we be, tall one," Teppeny said.  I am not that tall, being half-elven, but all things are relative.
<br><br>
   Teppeny continued.  "She warned me to look for you if ever I found myself near Qeynos . . . and from the looks of you, my handsome young bucko, I see why she made her words as warning."
<br><br>
   Her open smile took away any tinge of insult from her words.  This halfling possessed a zest and love for life which permeated her entire being, and only a fool or scoundrel would mistake her ingenuousness for malice.
<br><br>
   Our meeting was perforce a short one, for our destinations were in opposite directions, but this is not the end of my tale of Teppeny.
<br><br>
   Over the weeks that followed, I saw her again and again, in Rivervale, in the plains of Karana, in Qeynos. 
Each time, she hailed me with a smile and a warm inquiry into my wellbeing.  Each time, in her recountings of her recent experiences, I could sense her joyful embracing of all life had to offer.
<br><br>
   Then one day, in Rivervale, I made the acquaintance of Mibbo, a young halfling rogue.  With a bard's and a rogue's natural affinity for each other, we quickly became friends.  As new acquaintances do, we compared our lists of friends for commonality.  It should come as no surprise that Teppeny was one friend we shared.
<br><br>
   "That Teppeny!" Mibbo chortled.  "A wild one, she be!"
<br><br>
   "How so, friend?" I asked.  "I sense a story here."
<br><br>
   "Aye, a story indeed, bard friend," said Mibbo.  "Settle back and lets me tell it to you."
<br><br>
   Of course, before he could begin his tale, Mibbo had first to fill his tankard with fine ale.  No halfling can tell a story with a dry throat.  Indeed, nor can a good bard.
<br><br>
   "As all well knows," Mibbo began, puffing on his pipe and squinting at me from one eye, "we halflings likes a little tipple o' the grape or the grain now and then."
<br><br>
   I nodded.  Some statements require no comment.
<br><br>
   "Now, as to Teppeny.  Aye, there be a lass who can puts any creature to shame when it comes to
consumptions o' the elixirs of life . . ."
<br><br>
   He paused, leaning back in his chair.
<br><br>
   "With the possible exception of a troll," he added as an afterthought, drawing a deep puff from his pipe.
<br><br>
   Again I nodded.
<br><br>
   "So here be Teppeny," Mibbo continued, "still short o' her 9th circle but eager to advance fast in the gatherings o' druids.  Now how does you suppose she decides to do such a thing?"  He looked at me expectantly.
<br><br>
   Shaking my head, I said, "I haven't the seed of an idea."
<br><br>
   "That be right!" he exclaimed, slapping his knee with the palm of his hand.  "Because though a wild one you be, as be most bards, you be nary as wild as Teppeny!"
<br><br>
   I waited.  You cannot hurry a good tale.
<br><br>
   "So Teppeny betakes herself -- no, not to Runnyeye as you mights expect -- to King Xorbb's Gorge, by jum!" he crowed.  "And she starts a'pounding on the evil spawns which do abound there."
<br><br>
   Mibbo was sitting up now, his pipe held by the bowl in one hand and its stem jabbing forward for emphasis.
<br><br>
   "Now that, ins and ofs itself, be not so noteworthy," he continued, "as many before her, and likely many after, wills betake themselves to Beholders Maze.  But our Teppeny, now, she does like her tipple, even when battlings the spawns of evil.  And our Teppeny, she be a considerate lass, aye, she be."
<br><br>
   He paused to take a deep puff from his pipe, expelling a fragrant white cloud.
<br><br>
   "So after she ups and downs a few bottles" he resumed, "she decides that the Maze be needing a crier - for many be the groups of adventurers who be wondering what time it is - and that she be just the halfling to does the job."
<br><br>
   A mischievous grin spread across Mibbo's face.
<br><br>
   "Now here be our Teppeny, staff in t'one hand, bottle in t'other, takings a drink . . ."
<br><br>
   And he put accent to his words by taking a deep draught of ale.
<br><br>
   ". . . takings a drink and then singings out so's her words echoes backs and forths from the walls o' the gorge . . ."
<br><br>
   He paused for a beat, then sang loudly in his clear tenor, "`The time at the sound o' the bottle be . . . TENS O'CLOCK IN THE EVENINGS!' . . . and smashings her bottle against the nearest spawn!"
<br><br>
   Then Mibbo sprang to his feet and followed suit, flinging his empty tankard into the fireplace.
<br><br>
   Mibbo could contain himself no longer.  He dissolved in laughter and sank back into his chair.  I admit, I joined him in his merriment, and soon we were both wiping happy tears from our eyes.
<br><br>
   Of course, we consumed many more tankards before the night gave way to dawn, and we told each other many more tales, but none made us smile quite so much as the tale of Teppeny, singing the time in the Gorge of King Xorbb.

<br><br><br>

   It is said by some that the path of a man's life is shaped by the women he encounters along the way.  I believe this to be no less true for half-elf or halfling, human or barbarian, dwarf or gnome, high elf or dark elf or wood elf, Erudite, ogre, or troll.
<br><br>
   Certainly the path of Kianel of Qeynos has felt the shaping of many women.  These tales have told you of just three.
<br><br>
   One gave me the start I needed to speed me along my life's path.  One worked a profound change in my life's direction.  One demonstrated that joy can be found in even the most unusual places along the way.
<br><br>
   There are many tales to tell of women in my life.  Perhaps, in the proper company and with suitable libations to hand, I will tell some more.
<br><br>
   If Mibbo is around, you can count on it.
