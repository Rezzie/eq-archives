I just wanted to give some feedback on the website and in particular one
of the authors, Nepenthia. I think the site is very well put together
and the ease of which you can find things and the links between them
well connected.  I read what was listed for Nepenthia and wanted to just
express my appreciation for her writing.  Her essays and articles are
well thought out, and provoke thought about alot of the roleplaying
aspects of Everquest.  I wish the best for your site, and hope the good
work continues.

I was wondering if you would be able to do something for new readers....
<br><br>
I just started reading Everquest Express about a week ago and am very interested in the fictional stories that people are writing.  However I have found it quite difficult to find the other parts in a multi-part tale.  I was wondering if it would be possible to put links to previous parts of the tale at the beginning of the story.  I know this would be VERY hard to go back through and do with all of the old ones, but maybe if you start now it would make it easier for people who have just started reading the site.  It's very daunting work to have to try and find the first 4 parts of the tale that you are reading when it's on part 5!  Thanks for the consideration.

<em>[Ed. - We already have something like that.  At the end of the story, click on the author's name.  That will take you to a listing of the author's work.  It's a start.  I'm thinking about setting up downloadable text and Word versions of some of the longer tales.  But I'm a big fan of not doing too much work...  :)]</em>

Man that is weird, I sorta took a vacation from EQ a while too ! For about 2 weeks I didn't play eq, I just went and deathmatched on unreal for a bit, played decent 3, watched 2 dvd'd I never got to the time to watch, hehe. Then I fiddled with differnt characters, but finally went back to my old level 10 ranger. Which I finally got to 11 today (highest i've ever been on any character). Funny thing also, for over an hour today, I sat and fished with a little halfing lady. Hell I had more fun fishing with her, and just babbeling away, then I ever did repeadly beating monsters.

Keep writing these articles absor, I look forward to them !!!
