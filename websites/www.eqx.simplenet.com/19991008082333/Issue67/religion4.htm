Trolls as a race are a puzzle to most scholars.  Possessing only rudimentary intelligence, one wonders how they can work themselves into a frenzy over the worship of gods whose best feature is their single-minded approach to hate and fear.
<br><br>
Troll society operates much as a dysfunctional family.  Their creator, or &quot;Father&quot;, is the god of Fear, who creates spasms of panic in even the most rock-like Troll.  They worship him to placate him, trying to keep him from unleashing his powers upon their race, who, of course, are unworthy of his attentions.  At the same time, they turn within the society and outside the society to act exactly as they fear Cazic Thule will act.   They bully and terrorize others, because that is what they learn from their god’s example.
<br><br>
In keeping with their limited intellect, Troll religion is a reactive, rather than proactive religion.  Instead of acting to create further terror in an aggressive sense, Trolls create terror to avoid terror.  If they do their jobs well, then &quot;Father Faceless&quot; will leave them alone.  Innoruuk, too, teaches them to hate as a reaction to fear.  Ian Ash said it well when he stated &quot;They fear what they do not understand, which happens to be a lot. They handle fear by avoiding it or destroying it, usually the latter&quot;.  Not for Trolls the dark elven sophisticated appreciation of negative emotion.  Trolls just bash things.
<br><br>
How can this be called a religion?  Trolls do have one thing that defines their actions as religion: a deep sense of superstition.  They are keenly aware of the difference between the sacred and the profane.  There are actions or things that are clearly &quot;good&quot; or &quot;right&quot; to them, and actions or things that are not.  The consequences to improper behavior are so high that a troll is likely to hurt someone who suggests that they act an improper way.
<br><br>
Every religion has a system of purity.  This separate of realms, between the sacred and profane is what defines the holy. This separation of realms has social implications also.  An Eskimo taboo that forbids a wife to knit while her husband is on a harpoon hunt illustrates, to that culture, that she cannot be tangling lines while he is trying to keep his lines free of entanglement.  Thus, in a way, an entire society molds itself into the system of belief.
<br><br>
Purity is important in both mental and physical ways.  Fasting before a holy event is a way of purifying the body, by ridding it of pollutants.  Fasting also serves as a way to purify the mind by focusing it to act in a holy way (i.e. to keep the fasting) and as a reminder that holiness or purity is the goal.  Objects which are considered holy must be treated as such, or they lose their power.  Access to holy objects can be limited by being able to be approached only by those who are pure.  In this way, only the pure may touch the pure.  In a game sense, this is accomplished by factions – if your faction reaches a &quot;pure&quot; state to a certain religion, more holy events will happen around you, and you may be granted access to holy areas that other, less pure individuals, could not reach.
<br><br>
Trolls do have this sense of holy/unholy, and they carry this superstitious attitude beyond their religion, but it exists nonetheless as a part of their idea of worship.  Their fear of divine retribution breeds a broader sense of fear, which they then pass on to their victims.  They will not necessarily plan a campaign of fear, but they are the best anarchic, chaotic creators of fear there is.
<br><br>
Much like the swamps they breed from, Trolls are the festering stink of fear personified.</P>
