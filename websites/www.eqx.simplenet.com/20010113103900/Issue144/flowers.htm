  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
    sudden uneasy silence fell between the two Teir'dal, and even the rumblings 
    of the molten pools nearby seemed to quiet for a moment. The scent of ash 
    seemed fresh aga</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">in 
    as if they had just arrived at this moment in time from someplace far away, 
    even though both had been here in the shadows of the lavastorm range for most 
    of the evening. The youthful Teir'dal necromancer sat as she had for hours, 
    staring in disbelief at what she had just heard her companion say. The battle-hardened 
    Sister of the Indigo towered over the frail necromancer, with a gaze nearly 
    as gloomy as the news she had brought. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Scattered in front of Furlespit were various cut-up patterns, discarded animal 
    hide and bones, shavings of metal, thread and silk. The shameful necromancer 
    and her equipment were generously covered in ash and soot from the volcanic 
    surroundings, even as she sat comfortably in the black sand. Furlespit looked 
    down from the warrior's gaze at her day&#146;s work as if it seemed to have 
    been for naught, and then slowly back up. As her tireless undead servant returned 
    to her, he noticed Valarrah standing there and dropped his load of pelts and 
    drew his sword. Valarrah quickly moved to parry the undead's sword as Furlespit 
    motioned her pet to be still.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &quot;Your Indigo issued garb makes Karn nervous,&quot; Furlespit warned her. 
    Furlespit began packing up her supplies distractedly. &quot;I must make Neriak 
    by daybreak, I've a new instructor who would be displeased if I were late.&quot; 
    She handed several loaded packs to her servant and looked towards the moon. 
    &quot;You will have to go without me, I've too much to do.&quot; Furlespit 
    said, stepping away from Valarrah. Valarrah stepped in front of Furlespit 
    with a scolding look.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &quot;We do not have time for this, we must leave now.&quot; Valarrah commanded. 
    Furlespit curled her arms tightly and stepped the other way around Valarrah 
    and started down the path. &quot;Furlespit, ignoring this isn't going to make 
    it go away,&quot; Valarrah called after her. &quot;The Dragoon Dispatches 
    have been recalled, and Vizier Tor&#146;Kyl himself issued the order. He&#146;s 
    been looking for a reason to start hunting you for a long time and now he 
    has it.&#148;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &quot;The Vizier's word is not the word of the Father,&quot; Furlespit huffed, 
    stomping down the path.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &quot;They know that you are alive and are looking for you again,&quot; Valarrah 
    persisted, catching up with the necromancer. &quot;If you go back you will 
    be killed.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Furlespit stopped and turned around, glaring at the taller warrior. &quot;Did 
    you come here to kill me? How can I trust you,&quot; Furlespit purposely looked 
    up and down her Indigo-issued plate mail, &quot;you have as much to gain for 
    my death as they do.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Valarrah stomped and looked away in anger. &quot;Furlespit the Dragoons have 
    been withdrawn, and the Vizier announced to the assembly that he suspected 
    that the Queen was dead. He was given some sort of vision from Innoruuk and 
    wants to unite the Nation under the King. They will disband the Lodge if Xon 
    doesn't conform to the new laws.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &quot;I heard you the first time!&quot; Furlespit growled. She turned away 
    with disgust and continued down the path. &quot;And now the proud are the 
    scorned. And then the bureaucrats take housing. Then they grant positions 
    of govern to Humans.&quot; Furlespit turned back to the warrior, &quot;Next 
    they cut to the chase and build a tunnel straight to Freeport, lined with 
    shops, right?&quot; A fire burned within the necromancer&#146;s eyes, glowing 
    green with fury. Valarrah stared back with a stone gaze. &quot;Send the Dragoons 
    afar, send the Acolytes with them. Start Necromantic research in the field. 
    Cooperate with the Heretics and get everyone away from home. Then they court 
    the have-nots and bring the surface dwellers to us.&quot; Furlespit continued 
    stomping down the path.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Valarrah summoned patience and continued after her. &quot;You aren't listening 
    to me, and this childish tantrum has got to stop. I know where you will be 
    safe, and have arranged passage.&quot; Valarrah ran to Furlespit's side. &quot;I 
    know as well as you do of the corruption in Neriak but you are jumping to 
    conclusions, and every step towards Neriak is one of your last.&quot; Furlespit 
    stopped and stared at Valarrah. &quot;You have to trust me, I know your torment 
    and I feel it too. Word on the wind is the family is rebuilding, and the Brotherhood 
    is back on the prowl. They are looking for you, Furlespit. Do not underestimate 
    them.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Furlespit gnashed her teeth. &quot;Like the others did?&quot; she spat. &quot;You're 
    right, I'm not listening to you. You speak with two tongues. How do I know 
    the others fate was not met at your hands, while under the promise that you 
    were misleading the guard you serve?&quot; Valarrah scowled at the bitter 
    necromancer. &quot;You know nothing of torment. Your torment was slipping 
    and lusting after one of your prey, and then losing him and having to face 
    a life never knowing-&quot; Furlespit paused as Valarrah's scowl turned hostile, 
    and turned away. &quot;Admit it Sister, after Beldro disappeared you gave 
    up. You were taken by the fire within you, but without him left with sorrow. 
    You went back to die. But when you got back instead it was to welcome arms.&quot; 
    Valarrah's stance warned Furlespit to stop. &quot;They must have congratulated 
    you. 'Great work, you dismantled the F'leurs -&quot; Without a word Valarrah 
    lashed out at Furlespit and struck her over the head with the hilt of her 
    sword, dropping her to the ground like a wet cloth. The undead Karn moved 
    to fight back only for an instance before being sent to the ether by the furious 
    Teir'dal warrior.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Valarrah calmed and then hefted the limp necromancer over her shoulder. &quot;It&#146;s 
    for your own good,&quot; she whispered as she turned back the other way and 
    moved quickly through the night.</font></p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Under a thick twinkling blanket of stars in a remote region of the Western 
    Commonlands, Valarrah sat down to rest beneath a tree. Furlespit was showing 
    signs of waking up soon as little sighs kept the weary warrior company. Leaning 
    back and stretching she looked across the starlit rolling plains, envisioning 
    the armies of the dead that would soon take the lands back, completing the 
    destruction of Old Takish Hiz. For now however the plains were peaceful and 
    serene, uninterrupted for miles and void of mortal construction. In the distance 
    the woods of Kithicor clung to the base of the HighPass Mountains like a velvet 
    cloak.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    A free spirited breeze played through the trees and grass, creating a crescendo 
    of sounds. Among them Valarrah could hear the call of sleep, but shook her 
    head to stay awake. She glanced over to Furlespit, and suppressed a worried 
    look. The strange Teir&#146;dal had been at the center of a great deal of 
    trouble, but she could not be allowed to fall into the hands of the Indigo 
    Brotherhood. Furlespit had cheated death since birth, and carried with her 
    a dreadful burden. The child&#146;s curse was the cause for much ruin, but 
    Valarrah remained all the more loyal to her, as did the other members of their 
    band of rebels. The remaining members, that is.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Valarrah winced and clenched her fists, throttling the wave of emotions that 
    plagued her as the vivid memories returned. Her knuckles cracked and her nails 
    pierced her palms, as she watched the scene again. She had followed Beldro 
    into the temples of Innoruuk deep within the last gate of Neriak, where he 
    confessed to her the depths of his insanity and the true meaning of what it 
    is to be ruled by chaos. She heard much that she was afraid to know, and suppressed 
    the meaning behind his methods. With a flash of pain she tried to block out 
    the memories, but the phantasm was still there. Beldro gifted to her a token 
    of his power, a strangely crafted shield with archaic runes spilled over it. 
    She knelt, clutching it and searching for her reflection in it, but instead 
    saw the shadow of the Dragoons rushing into the chamber behind her. Her head 
    spun around to look behind her and then back to Beldro, who looked towards 
    her with a gaze beyond wisdom before turning his stare into the onrush of 
    guards. <br>
    She openly betrayed them, crying out to stop even as the captain patted her 
    shoulder with a smile. She snarled at him as she was promptly dragged kicking 
    from the room, struggling to hold onto her line of sight of Beldro. With gusto 
    he defied the might of the Indigo, sending waves of death&#146;s chill throughout 
    the chamber in an unholy display of power, while the Sabers played violent 
    shadows through his show of evocation. An audible gasp escaped Valarrah as 
    that sound echoed in her mind, filling the expanse of the Commonlands with 
    its hollow cry. That sound that she heard as she was pulled out of sight of 
    the melee and held by the guard. It was a sound she had heard no mortal make, 
    and she had heard them all. The sound ripped through her until there was no 
    more pain to feel.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Her defiance was her own disciplinary judgement, she was never questioned 
    about her actions in front of the Captain. The wrath of Innoruuk himself played 
    on her soul, knowing that her masters knew of her alliance to the rebel guild 
    and taunted her with rewards for her good service to the Teir&#146;dal nation. 
    Instead they held her betrayal secret, and she swallowed the burden of living 
    with that to protect those that remained of the F&#146;leurs DuMal. She would 
    protect them by not returning to them, and stayed in service in Neriak.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    So many lost, she thought to herself as began to calm down. Furlespit had 
    somehow been spared only because they believed the Koada'dalto have killed 
    her nearly a year ago. The rest were hunted, and they were hunted until the 
    remnants of their cause were forgotten. Soon after the last disappeared the 
    hypocrisy of the Vizier was realized as the power of the Foreign Quarter rogue 
    markets expanded to control more than ever. Valarrah gritted her teeth, staring 
    at her toes. Now the Vizier had the mendacity to challenge the Lodge of the 
    Dead with his laws, all amidst the stir over the Queen. Even the General seemed 
    detached when he made the order to withdraw the search for the Queen. It was 
    no secret that the Queen had opposed the word of the King, but not even he 
    could oppose her will.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    The Vizier spoke to the assembly of his vision as he was visited by the Father 
    himself, and spoke of the Queen as a coal that had burned out too distant 
    from the flame. He called for the unity of the Teir&#146;dal nation under 
    the King. With the voice of an avatar he trembled the very walls of the city. 
    With the birth of gods came the passing of those who would hold themselves 
    to be gods, he commanded. Yet to Valarrah the rumblings in Neriak sounded 
    more like a nation ready to fall and Valarrah was not the only one listening.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;They will fall,&#148; Valarrah said out loud. &#147;He will fall.&#148;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;Yes,&#148; Furlespit said, eyes still closed. &#147;Yes Sister, he will.&#148; 
    Furlespit sat up slowly, lightly touching the bump on her head. She looked 
    around until she realized where they were, and stared up into the mountains. 
    &#147;We are meeting in the pass?&#148; Furlespit looked to Valarrah. Valarrah 
    nodded. &#147;I take it the Kithicor Outpost dissented then? Is that your 
    safe passage?&#148; Furlespit wrinkled her brow.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;Yes they have, but not to our advantage,&#148; Valarrah informed her. 
    &#147;Ambassador K&#146;ryll was sent to bring them back into the fold. Unless 
    we are lucky he will get there before we do, and they will probably suspect 
    we would head through the pass.&#148; Valarrah paused to gather her equipment. 
    &#147;No, we are not headed through Kithicor. One of the goblin mines in the 
    thicket opens into the gorge.&#148; The two exchanged knowing looks, and then 
    picked up their equipment to leave. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furlespit 
    suddenly began searching through the grass around the tree. &#147;Where did 
    you put my other boot?&#148; Furlespit whined. Just then the boot sailed towards 
    them through the air, landing at Furlespit&#146;s feet. Standing not far away 
    were two figures, a Feir&#146;dal tracker and a member of the Koada'dal Watch.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;A pleasure to meet you ladies under the stars this morn,&#148; The Feir&#146;dal 
    mocked in his native tongue as they took battle stances and charged. <br>
    Valarrah deftly kicked a loose stone up and into the head of the wood elf, 
    which caused him to stumble slightly, but before she could reach him with 
    her swords the High Elf had met her and they exchanged parries. Furlespit 
    quickly leaped away from the combat and sprinted away into the tall grass. 
    &#147;Get her,&#148; the High Elf snapped has he pushed Valarrah closer to 
    the tree. The ranger readied his bow but had lost sight of Furlespit, and 
    began chasing her.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Valarrah and the high elf traded blows, neither gaining advantage. She skillfully 
    drew his following shield blow away and brought a raised boot to his jaw, 
    knocking him back. He quickly recovered and countered by sweeping her legs 
    from under her. In a thunder of blade strikes she was back on him though, 
    drawing blood, but not without him slipping his blade through and piercing 
    her abdomen plate. She pushed him back and struck him soundly over the helm, 
    then followed with a pommel punch to the jaw. He stumbled back and squared 
    against her. In a whoosh of wind and gold sparkles he channeled the grace 
    of Tunare into a wave of force, knocking the Teir&#146;dal a dozen meters, 
    slamming her into the ground. <br>
    She shook her head and leaped up, still writhing with pain from the blow. 
    As he charged forward she hurled one of her swords at him, which he easily 
    dodged. She feigned to throw the one from her off hand as he leapt forward 
    with a threatening overhand swing, meeting her quick upward slash in flight. 
    With the tuned fury of an artist she let into the paladin until he finally 
    collapsed at the base of the tree. She disarmed him and pressed him up against 
    the tree sitting.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Valarrah quickly looked around for Furlespit and the wood elf, but they were 
    nowhere to be seen. Valarrah sighed in frustration, then heard a whispered 
    prayer coming from the high elf. She quickly turned around and struck him 
    soundly in the temple with the hilt of her sword, stood up and drove her blade 
    deep into his chest. With a convulsion he cried out, &#147;Tunare help me,&#148; 
    and then died. Valarrah picked up her other sword and what remained of Furlespit&#146;s 
    equipment and began running the way she had seen Furlespit last headed.</font></p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;<i>Pixie feathers</i>,&#148; the wood elf cursed quietly, as he smelled 
    the soil for signs of Furlespit&#146;s tracks. He had accurately followed 
    her well into the woods, and knew for certain where he last had seen her tracks 
    but had lost the trail in a clearing of dead trees and moss. He quickly covered 
    the area, searching for something he may have overlooked, but as more time 
    passed he stopped, and looked back the way he had come. He had nearly given 
    up when a pack of wolves came into the clearing, which also seemed to be tracking 
    someone. <i>&#147;By the graces, children of Tunare have you smelled a Teir&#146;dal 
    in the area this morning?&#148;</i> he communed with them. It was then he 
    saw the unholy red glow in their eyes, and realized he had crossed onto cursed 
    soil. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fear 
    took hold and he leapt into a tall tree, climbing well into the canopy. He 
    looked below at the pack of dreadwolves pacing at the base of the tree. Breathing 
    hard, he rested his head against a branch for a moment, sighing in relief. 
    He started to look around for an adjacent tree to cross to when he came nose 
    to nose with his original prey, and felt her dirk pass between his ribs. Furlespit 
    held on to him tightly as he flailed, trying to grab his own sword. She twisted 
    the dirk, and ran her fingers through his wet hair. As the pain seared through 
    him he heard her quiet chanting and felt his life force drain away. She kissed 
    him softly down his cheek and onto his shoulder as he made his death throws. 
    She held her hand over his chest and looked into his eyes until he was still 
    and then kissed him again, letting him fall from the tree.</font></p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Valarrah searched well into daybreak and had still not found signs of Furlespit. 
    In the distance in the woods she could hear the Dragoons meeting over breakfast. 
    Indeed it sounded as if the Ambassador had reached them quickly. She hid Furlespit&#146;s 
    equipment in her own pack, standing behind a tree. She took a few deep breaths, 
    hoping Furlespit was still alive. She marched into their camp, and they all 
    stood and looked to her with interest.<br>
    &#147;What do you have to report?&#148; She demanded sternly.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    The brightest of them came forward. &#147;Scouts spotted one of the rebels 
    headed into the goblin mines. We were just readying to head that way.&#148; 
    He said.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;Excellent,&#148; she replied. &#147;I will take it from here. You are 
    all commanded by the general to report to the Neriak Commons at once.&#148;<br>
    The Dragoon argued. &#147;The Ambassador himself specified that if you reported 
    here I was to accompany you to hunt the necromancer down. The others will 
    report in my stead, and my lieutenant will have expected it.&#148;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Valarrah suppressed her frustration, formulating a plan to lose or kill this 
    Dragoon on their way to the mines. He was an adept swordsman, and would not 
    be fooled easily. Wounded as she was she might not be able to defeat him in 
    an open combat. The group finished their formalities and began their separate 
    ways, all the while Valarrah planning his demise. &#147;What is your name, 
    soldier?&#148;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;V&#146;nain Ravensblood,&#148; he replied as they walked along. &#147;I&#146;ve 
    heard of your exploits in battle, Valarrah. It is an honor to hunt with you.&#148; 
    He said eagerly. She could occasionally feel his eyes over her form as they 
    made their way quickly to the hills. In his every comment she sensed his interest, 
    and wondered if he had sent the others back only to get her alone. This would 
    work quite to her advantage if she played it right, she grinned to herself.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    They traveled into midday and arrived at the mines, where they were met by 
    a set of goblin miners and traders. Shaded under the towering Highpass mountains 
    outside the mines the Teir&#146;dal sat down for a drink and to eat with the 
    goblins. They questioned the goblins as if they had seen Furlespit, but the 
    goblins were in much more a mood to barter.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;Lady I think you would look mighty delicious in a necklace made with 
    these rubies,&#148; the leader of the group grinned wickedly. Valarrah frowned. 
    The goblin scratched his head and licked his lips. &#147;Pardon the saying,&#148; 
    he chuckled. &#147;Perhaps these sapphires?&#148; he continued, showing her 
    a wealth of gems and stones.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;We have no time to barter anymore. Have you seen another Teir&#146;dal 
    this way early this morning? I was supposed to meet her.&#148; Valarrah was 
    losing her patience with the disgusting merchant.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;I just dunno,&#148; the merchant conned. &#147;I get my head in my work 
    and I forget who I&#146;ve seen.&#148; He grinned.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;What lovely sapphires!&#148; called a sudden voice from the way they 
    had come, surprising the group. Valarrah turned into the shadow of a very 
    powerful looking Teir&#146;dal, dressed in the combat gear of a High Regent 
    of Innoruuk. A troubled look passed over his face as he looked to the Dragoon. 
    &#147;What are you doing this far from your post, soldier?&#148; he asked. 
    The Dragoon held his head low. Valarrah felt a twinge of panic building in 
    her.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;We are hot on the trail of a criminal to Neriak, Regent.&#148; He said 
    reverently.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    The Regent smiled and patted the Dragoon on the shoulder. &#147;Excellent 
    work. Now head home before you are punished,&#148; he commanded.<br>
    The Dragoon looked to argue, but the aura of hate was strong with the Regent. 
    The Dragoon looked once for help from Valarrah and then hurried back down 
    the path out of sight.</font></p>

    &#147;About those sapphires,&#148; the Regent cooed to the goblin. &#147;I 
    will buy them all.&#148; He dropped an open purse of platinum in front of 
    the goblin, who took the pouch with shaking hands. &#147;Now,&#148; he raised 
    his voice slightly, &#147;where is the girl?&#148;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    The goblin motioned them to follow, and Valarrah looked around for a way to 
    escape. The Regent of Innoruuk was far more powerful than she, and seemed 
    quite well informed as to where to find Furlespit. &#147;She is this way,&#148; 
    the goblin said with glee, and Valarrah followed with her heart in her stomach.

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;You mean she is here?&#148; the bewildered warrior asked. The goblin 
    nodded and led them down several levels into the mines, where they found Furlespit 
    auctioning a set of her tailor-made whips to the head goblin taskmaster. Valarrah&#146;s 
    nerves frizzled as the Regent made his way promptly to the necromancer, who 
    casually looked up to them. Furlespit and the Regent looked to each other 
    for a long moment, no one making a sound. Valarrah stifled her panic as Furlespit 
    quickly stood up.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;Your eminence!&#148; Furlespit exclaimed, throwing her arms around the 
    Regent, who returned the embrace warmly. Valarrah collapsed into a chair, 
    wiping her hand over her brow. She felt a wave of tension pass her in relief.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    &#147;You two know each other?&#148; Valarrah finally asked. The Regent turned 
    a questioning look back to the warrior. <br>
    &#147;It&#146;s ok, she is with me,&#148; Furlespit said. The Regent smiled.<br>
    &#147;How did you know where to find me?&#148; Furlespit wondered out loud.<br>
    &#147;I knew the guard would lead me to you,&#148; the Regent exchanged a 
    knowing look to Valarrah.<br>
    &#147;Your Sister Indigo is lucky that Innoruuk guides her, I expected to 
    have to kill her.&#148; He grinned wickedly.<br>
    &#147;Come now, lets discuss this over a drink.&#148;</font></p>
