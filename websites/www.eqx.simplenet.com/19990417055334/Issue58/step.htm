A couple of years ago I got married to a wonderful woman.  Not only did she give me herself, but she also blessed me with three children.  Yes, I'm a stepfather.  Stepfather.  Is that such a dirty word?   I use to think it was.  
<br><br>
My mother and father were divorced when I was just twelve.  She remarried soon after to what I called The Tyrant!  An evil man he was, whose every word was law.  I feared him terribly.   My stepfather and me didn't have much in common. Like most fathers, he didn't understand me.  Most of the things I liked to do, he didn't care for.  Most of the time he didn't approve of me (at least that's what I thought) and it seemed I would usually get either beat or grounded for most of the stuff I did do.
<br><br>
So I spent most of my teenage years living in fear around him.  I hated him.
<br><br>
It wasn't until I came back on emergency leave from Honduras that I discovered who my stepfather really was.  I had joined the Army as my stepfather had done, right out of high school.  I think I joined the army more to escape from them, or myself.  I'm really not sure which.  Anyway I was in Honduras and received an emergency Red Cross message that my father was dying of a brain aneurysm and was not expected to live.  I couldn't let him leave without at least saying goodbye.  Something inside me told me to go home.  So I did.  When I got to the hospital this evil man, this giant monster that tried to replace my father was lying there, helpless and scared.  It was then I discovered I loved this man.  I feared I was going to lose him.  I had feelings I didn't know I had for him.   How could I love such an evil person?   It was because I discovered that my stepfather was proud of me.  In fact, he said I was like a son to him.   I guess he just never had the courage to tell me.
<br><br>
Well, I'm (we) are lucky God had other plans for my stepfather because he survived the incident, and is alive and well today.  My step dad is the greatest guy in the world, and I love him like a son loves a father.  I just have two dads now.
<br><br>
But there is one question that has always disturbed me.  Why did it take so long for us to figure that out?  Why did we spend all those years living together and hating each other like that?
<br><br>
Well, now here I am taking the role of a stepfather.  What will keep me from being the same kind of evil man?  Will they think of me as a tyrant?  Am I now someone that would be trying to replace their father?
<br><br>
Let me tell you, I had those thoughts, and I was scared to death.  
<br><br>
My wife's oldest child, was at the time we got married, was a new teenage boy.  He had just turned thirteen.  He was a bit rough with me at first.  He had been the man of the house for quite some time, and I had just relieved him of his duties.  So of course we butted heads a few times at first.  
<br><br>
As time passed I discovered that this guy was a lot like me when I was his age.  <em>This works to my advantage now, because I know his every move even before he has a chance to make it.</em>
<br><br>
I found that he really enjoyed computers.  I taught him to build them and take apart.  I'm actually trying to teach him everything I know about the world of computers.  <em>But only because he wants to learn</em>.  We also found that we both love computer games.  Most nights you can find us competing against each other at 3d shooters.  <em>Of course, he usually wins</em>.
<br><br>
Yea, I guess I do carry the title stepfather, but I don't think of myself as one.  The kids don't call me "dad", and I don't expect them too.  <em>Nor do I actually want them too</em>.   I don't want to think of myself as the guy taking their father's place.  I'd rather think of myself as being their friend.  
<br><br>
Now mind you, I am an adult and expect to be treated as an adult, and for the most part, they don't have a problem respecting that.  <em>I only occasionally have to remind them of this</em>.
<br><br>
My wife has done a wonderful job raising these kids by herself.  I have learned a lot from her, and them.  They are just great kids.  
<br><br>
And who am I?   I'm just their good friend, Jim.
