HALAS -
<br><br>
We sent two cub reporters up to the cold lands of the tall barbarians to investigate rumors of terrible weather and the rising of many spirits of the dead.  Our hope was determine if the two events were related, and to give our readers a description of the devastation that the weather has created.  Neither reporter sent word to us, and they left over a month ago.  We then dispatched a third reporter, Grellor, a stout Dwarf.  His letter arrived just this afternoon.  As you know, we keep nothing from our readers, so here is the letter in full.
<br><br>
'<em>Found them.  Both frozen.  Dead.  It's cold.  No spirits.  Too much snow.</em>'
<br><br>
Grellor is, well, not much for words, but he's a hardy fellow.
<br><br>
QEYNOS -
<br><br>
Rumors of a riot focused on a popular news center are completely false.  What some news agencies, especially those nasty town criers, are reporting as a riot was merely a few small families throwing stones.  What they have been touting as roaring masses would be more accurately described as weeping mothers and sisters.  Members of the small crowd refused to be interviewed, refused with the use of large clubs and sharp kitchen utensils when this reporter ventured into their midst from his office (conveniently located just in front of those same weeping families).  From what they were heard to yell as we retreated behind our stout, iron reinforced doors, it appears that they are upset about some stories that they have heard about the storms raging in the north.  They were concerned about the people there and how they had heard that some young boys had died in the terrible weather.  We applaud their concern, and share it with them.
<br><br>
The guard arrived shortly and sent the crowd home.  They also knocked, repeatedly and with some sort of large wooden log, on our very office door to make certain that we were well.  After being informed that we were fine, the guardsmen left, vowing to return and see to our good health at a later date.  We wish to thank them for their diligence and concern.
<br><br>
NOW HIRING -
<br><br>
Fit to Print is hiring cub reporters at this time.  We need only two, so competition will be stiff.  Starting salary will be discussed with qualified applicants.  Sons and daughters of military personnel or powerful wizards need not apply.  Please come to our Qeynos Branch for an interview if interested.
<br><br>
MOVING -
<br><br>
Yes, Fit to Print will be moving its main offices from their current Qeynos location.  The overwhelming popularity of our column seems to be attracting so much attention that we find it hard to work with all of the folks banging and screaming at our doors.  We will be moving to an undisclosed location, perhaps to Freeport, we're not sure yet.  Once we get settled in, and all this hoopla about our great work dies down, we will let you know where we settle.
<br><br>
But we still need a few new cub reporters.  Perhaps we will contact them ourselves...
