     I was looking at old issues of EQX, and I ran across a piece of writing by Onnie. It was an article she wrote about Oxessiess (did I spell that right?)<em>[Nobody ever does... - Absor]</em> and things that had changed her character's world, called <a href="../Issue109/heroes.htm">Heroes Passing into Tales</a>. I found it to be a good, almost touching article. The story and the things that happened to Oxessiess made EQ just a little more special to me, making me want to play EQ even more just to get those kind of things to happen to my character. That's what EQ is for me, it's a place that I can go to have powerful, interesting things happen to my character and give me an escape from my boring normal life, and just spend a few hours killing something and living out fantasies. &lt;sigh&gt; Unfortunately my characters are largely romance deprived. Oh well.

    I was soooo upset to see that EQX is on vacation.  Gah!!  I hope that no matter what happens it stays around, because it is really awesome.  Also if you ever need more writers, I would be glad to help out!!  I'm looking forward to seeing new EQX soon!

I just wanted to email you to tell you that I think Everquest Express is
fantastic, lately you and the other Staff have been hinting that EQX is
getting boring or old and I just want you to know that i'm enjoying it now more then ever.  You consistantly produce quality work, EQX continues to inspire me and make me laugh and think.  Don't let anyone get you down and keep up the good
work!

So this will be the 2nd time I have written about Bard's Log, but I couldn't resist after this last one.  The prying evil eye was just too funny to let go without congratulating him on his ingeniousness.  Keep up the good work!!

Dear Absor,
<br><br>
	As of today, I have read every volume of Everquest Express - since number 
one. I have visited every website both guild and other. I have played the 
game for months solid. I have enjoyed immersing myself in the Everquest
Experience. I look forward to the Ruins of Karnak and I try to balance on 
the highwire between powergaming and roleplaying.<br><br>
	I also have spent time in almost every chat room on each homepage where I 
have heard few compliments and many gripes. Even I have composed a list of 
gripes - which got whittled down to suggestions for Aradune; which I
didn't post.<br><br>
	I decided to meditate on the subject and here are the conclusions I have 
reached re: some of the topics discussed in you last issue.<br><br>
	I think it's very easy to gripe and blame Verant, the Gm's, Customer
Service and everything else for parts or things in the game that players feel
are not right.<br><br>
	Like little children we clamor to get attention; yell, scream, holler, cry
and harass because we believe our issues are more important than any other.
And then stick all the blame on the creators of the game when we are not
happy with the results. Verant at least listens and addresses many of the 
issue that players raise plus make fair and positive changes. But sometimes 
they say 'no' - which leaves more than a few people unhappy.<br><br>
	Aradune has it right. You can't make everyone happy all the time!
Sometimes burnout will occur - and that's the time to pull back and maybe
play something else, or start at the bottom and reinvent your character.
Even play a race and character you hate!<br><br>
	I know when I get tired or frustrated, I head to my PlayStation - and when 
I burn out on my Playstation, I head to my computer.<br><br>
	This game is made for people to interact. And like most things in life,
we only have ourselves to blame when things go wrong. 	It is up to the 
players to be responsible and react in POSITIVE ways. I think Everquest 
Express does a fantastic job trying to do just that. Keep up the good work!!<br><br>
	I believe that guilds could play a larger part also - I have met several 
wonderful people in various guilds that roleplay - enhancing everyone's 
game on my server. People in guilds should take their gripe(s) to the 
guild, hold meetings and have discussion on ways to make things better. Then the guild should make suggestions based on member response to the GM and/or Customer 
Support and follow up with those suggestions.<br><br>
	Lastly, I don't know of any other Network Mud, moo or RPG that slowly 
tailors itself to the majority of players.  If the majority of players are 
levels 40 to 50, then Verant must address their issues first because the 
company doesn't want to loose those loyal customers who have invested so 
much time and energy in the game.<br><br>
	On the other hand, Verant does try to keep it fun, exciting and not too 
frustrating for the lower levels who are advancing.  Put yourself in their 
shoes. It's a fine line they walk to keep the game balanced and fair for 
all.  Setting the rope on fire doesn't help matters.<br><br>
	EverQuest players can make their adventures in Norrath what they will - be 
it a haven to escape daily life,  to have fun and frolic.... or make it a 
frustrating hell. It is their choice.<br><br>
	In the end everyone should just remember one thing....it's only a GAME!
<br><br>
Well, that's my two copper for what it's worth.
<br><br>
Happy Hunting -
