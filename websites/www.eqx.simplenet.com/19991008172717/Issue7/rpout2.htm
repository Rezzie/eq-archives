	<em>As darkness falls on the dwarven race, the Wise Old Ones decide that the dwarves must become less insular and make the world aware of the rich depth of dwarven lore.  Only in this way will dwarves as a race find the support they need to survive.  The Council of the Wise request volunteers to go out into the known world and teach other races of the dwarven way of life, and to learn from these outsiders ways in which the dwarves may survive. Young Oghma, son of Dorin Steelhammer, a smith, asks to be one of the chosen dwarves.  His training in lore is extensive and takes many years.  He leaves the mountain fastness where he was born, and sets out to become a town smith in a small human town, and learn and teach as a member of the community.</em>

Having that concept in mind, I can act accordingly.  What would Oghma do as a new character?  What kind of things would he avoid doing?  He definitely is a "good" character type.  Would he aid those in need?  Would he be xenophobic, as are many dwarves?  Is he an "adventurer"?  As Oghma faces challenges, his "concept" may need tweaking, but always (hopefully) in the direction of learning more, and teaching more.  He may adventure at first, until he finds a town which is suitable.

Formative events can give a character impetus for action also.  As Oghma wanders Norrath, he sees a small hamlet in the distance which looks favorable.  He camps for the night and decides to head to it the next day.  When darkness falls, he sees the hamlet light up in flames, and rushes to it.  Orcs have attacked the hamlet!  Aiding the villagers in the defense of their homes, he sees the devastation that the Orcs wreak upon civilization.  How would Oghma react to this?  Would he become an Orc headhunter? Would he stay at the village? He's a fairly young dwarf, trained in knowledge and smithing...

Look outside of class lines and along "ability/interest" lines when creating a character.  If you do that, you will become multi-dimensional, instead of another damn dwarf. :)
