This year was a little different for me.  I finished my Christmas shopping way early (over a week early), and even had time to pick up my mother's gifts to my brother and his wife.   No running about at the last minute desperately trying to find something to give my dad.  No fighting for standing room in the malls.  None of that crap.  I am so pleased with myself.
<br><br>
Everything else, however, is going as usual for the holidays.  I spent as much money buying myself things as I did on gifts for my entire family combined.  Tomorrow, when I visit my brother and we exchange gifts (which is today, as you read this) he will invariably have given me something that I bought for myself just a few days ago.  My mother will complain that I spent too much money on her gift (and I did).  And my father will break what I give him a few minutes after I get in my car to drive home.
<br><br>
Some of those are exaggerations, of course.  But we've all experienced them, or something very similar.
<br><br>
And to top it all off, one of my televisions, the one that keeps my entertained while I'm at my computer, when nuts yesterday.  It decided that the power button wasn't something that it liked.  I can only turn it off by unplugging it.  It has also come down with a serious case of channel changing fever.  You know, it's become one of those that constantly changes the channel.  Constantly.  As long as it is plugged in it's flipping channels.
<br><br>
It drove me nuts.  So I get to go to the mall and brave the after Christmas mash, which is worse than the pre-Christmas mash, so that I can buy a new television...  And I thought I was doing so well this year.
<br><br>
Regardless of my problems, I wish you all the best this season.  I hope you had a great Christmas (because NONE of you are reading this on Christmas, you're all out with your families having fun).  And I hope you have a great new year.
<br><br>
Me, I'll be in the office on the 1st, catching and squishing all them Y2K bugs.  ;)
