I took this week completely away from EverQuest.  I ran across Razor (a former EQX staffer) in ICQ after not having talked with him for a while, and he has been building a MUD.  For those of you who don't know what a MUD is, well, EverQuest is a MUD, although a much much spiffier and more complex one.
<br><br>
MUDs, or Multi User Domains, began in the late 70's and The original version merely allowed a user (player) to move about in a virtual location, later versions provided for more variation including objects and commands which could be modified on or offline. The goal for developing the first MUD was to provide a multi-player game defined and interpreted by an external database The point of the game was to gain points until you achieved the rank of wizard, at which point you became a wizard and gained certain powers over mortals.   As it progressed, it became thematic, with fantasy, science fiction, or other genres. It descended down to what we have now, EverQuest, a graphic rather than text-based game world with classes, races, and gods.
<br><br>
That brings me to why I got involved in the MUD in the first place - religion.  One of the things that I miss in Norrath is religion that matters.  The Gods of Norrath are faction categories and monsters to defeat. That, to me, is disappointing.  All clerics share the same spells, which is standard fantasy fare, but I wish that different religions would have different spells.  It seems odd to me that all religions treat their priesthood identically. - Wouldn't Innoruuk have something different in store for his priests than Mithaniel Marr?  Wouldn't Erollisi, Goddess of Love, allow her clerics to use powers like charm to influence others?  Druids and clerics are two separate priesthoods, with different advantages and spell lists, but there are many other gods.
<br><br>
Shouldn't faith matter?  If you do all sorts of quests for your god, and obtain a high faction, will you somehow be rewarded?  Is faction the same as holiness? I think that gods should be worshipped, and those fanatic worshippers should get more than a warm role-playing feeling.  Saints and heroes are the stuff of legends.
<br><br>
Maybe I'm asking too much (I'm certain I am) of a large commercial MMORPG, to provide this sort of interaction and immersion.  There are too many people to please, too many play-styles to accommodate.  It's just too complex to offer that level of depth. I think EQ is one of the best games I've ever played, and I'm sure I'll be playing it for a long time, but this break has been nice, and I'll come back in later, perhaps refreshed.  Kunark may be a step towards further immersion, if some of these screenshot's are any indication.
<br><br>
I'm getting a chance with Razor's MUD to help create how his religion works, and I'm having a blast.  Gods, goddesses, and priesthoods for each, with different powers and skills.  Tracking for a hunter's god, spells of disease and poison for a goddess of pain.  And I get to write the myths and legends, too :).
