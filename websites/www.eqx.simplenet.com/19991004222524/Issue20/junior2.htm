Thyvald walked with a light step towards the meeting with his superior.  The Bothin
crack had gone really well, and there was no way that the Thieves Guild could know of
the three extra first quality gems and five second value gems he had secreted before
writing his report.  "I’m going to go up quickly in rank, I just know it!" thought
Thyvald.  "No thief of my level has ever done such a clean job!"
<br><br>
As he walked around the corner, he bumped into a dwarf, and heard the jangle of harp strings from the dwarf’s pack.

"Watch it, human," grumbled the dwarf, "or you’ll be hurrying to your funeral."
<br><br>
"Sorry."
<br><br>
Thyvald didn’t want to risk losing his anticipated take from Bothrin.  Besides, the
dwarf hadn’t budged when Thyvald ran into him, but Thvyald had rebounded off him like
an ball striking a wall.
<br><br>
Finally, Thyvald turned the corner and saw his superior at the end of the alley,
under a street light.

As he listened from the shadows near the alley entrance, the dwarf heard a sudden
scream and gargling gasp.  "Hmpf," Oghma snorted, "I guess he was hurrying to his
funeral."
