The guard at the door to my cell fidgets nervously. I understand the task of guarding me is handed out as punishment. It used to be that only the most highly trained and the most alert were assigned to be my wardens; I am a dangerous figure after all. But now the unruly apprentices and un<em>faithful</em> Paladins are my keepers.  My efforts to educate these poor, primitive beasts go forever unappreciated.  I am Malice, and I am a Dark Elf Shadow Knight, making me one of the most hated individuals in Norrath.  No other profession is as despised as the <em>art</em> of Necromancy.  Many call Necromancy Death Magic, or Black Magic.  They believe it an evil to be expunged by the allies of life.  The fools, they don't realize that Necromancy <em>is</em> the Magic of Life. The giving and taking of life. The Shadow Knight can draw off the excess life force of others, he can find the flickering life force of the injured or dead and he can breathe new life into ancient bones!  What evil is this I ask? Alas, the lesser races will have none of it and, except for a few on their way up the evolutionary ladder, continue to avoid and hate it.  These misconceptions are very much my concern. I thrive on them; I thrive on the hatred they produce.  I thrive on their hypocrisy.  Since I was a child I have thrived on it.  My parents so kindly gifted me with a name drawn from the common tongue of the lesser races.  This is a widespread practice among Teir'Dal parents, as it insures the ridicule of their children by all that hear their name. Others express their contempt for the child and the child learns to hate them and those who where responsible for putting the burden upon them.  This is, of course, all sanctioned and encouraged by the church.  Anything to cultivate antipathy.  Hate… hate is the guiding force of the true faith.  In hate the dark elves where created and in hate we grow.  Hate strengthens us; hate drives us to create. Those who don't follow the true faith appear to be wary of hate. They say that love or some other tawdry emotion is the force of creation. They say that hate leads only to destruction. <em>Nothing</em> could be farther from the truth.  Hatred drives one to create, to strengthen oneself.  The lengths to which I have seen a spurned lover go to revenge herself.  The efforts of one religion to denounce a rival faith.  The intricacy of the games played by children to eject from their midst an unwanted fellow.  Then the vicious-counter attack the shunned youth makes on his former playmates.  Antipathy has driven societies to make their grandest creations.  Hate is the ultimate creative force.  Love is a cheap substitute for hate, used by those too weak to revel in the greater power of hatred.  I suppose the lesser races fear it. One can't blame them; they are after all, the inferior species.  No, one can't blame them, but one can despise them.  Some cling to the mindless dogma of their godlings.  They blindly follow Veeshan the Wurm Queen, or Erollisi Marr goddess of lust.  The insidious underfoot openly worship Brell Serilis, the oath breaker.

The movement of the guard at the door to my cell draws my attention.  The present guard is relieved by a new one who immediately closes his eyes and begins to snore.  I cannot differentiate between humans. Physically they all look the same, but I have noted that at this shift the sluggish one always rests.  The humans seem to at least have the simian intelligence to make sure I never have the chance to meditate to restore my magical energies, but I have managed, through quick undetected sessions of meditation and simple idleness, to amass a small supply of the mystical mana. I turn to the decaying body of a rat I found in the cell. I had killed and hidden the rat earlier and now it had reached an appropriate state of decomposition.  Quietly speaking the words of power under my breath and subtly weaving my hands I send a tendril of magical energy into the corpse.  The carcass shudders to life.  On a table outside of my cell lie my weapons, armor and the key to my cell.  I command the decaying rodent to fetch me the key.  Silently it skitters out from beneath the bars of my cell.  It's skeletal claws make a steady clicking noise as it moves across the stone floor but the guard remains asleep.  The rat climbs the table and seizes the key in its mouth.  Success! The rodent climbs down the table and scurries towards me.  The creature drops the key in front of me and waits obediently as I take the key.  I consider my creation for a moment; it has served me well.  I raise my foot and crush the undead creature beneath my heel. It perishes without a sound.  I insert the key in the door to my cell and turn it ever so slowly. With freedom in reach, I ease the door open.  My hands snake out and seize the guard by the head. He startles awake, but before he can make a sound I draw the life out of him and into me.  Thus fortified, I move to the table and began to don my equipment.  When at last I am once again armed and armored I turn to look at the dead guard and the look of terror frozen on his face.  A pity, yes a pity.  Another unknowing disciple of Innoruk perishes. Yes, these hypocritical Knights of Marr and the equally sanctimonious monks of Rodect Niff, every one of them pays tribute to my god.  How you ask?  I answer your question with a question. What passion is it, which drives these creatures to fight to the death against the true faith? What emotion is it, that every one of the sub-races of Norrath feels for my people?  I tell you it is hate, sweet delicious hate.
