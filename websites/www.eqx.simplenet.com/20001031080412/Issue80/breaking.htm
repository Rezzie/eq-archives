Razor removed a small thin metal rod from his black leather leg pouch.   There was not a lock made in all of Norrath that he couldn't pick.  He took pride in his work.  He carefully and quietly worked the intricacies of the lock mechanism and within seconds a slight metallic "click" could be heard.  From his leather pouch he removed a second item, a small jar of gnome grease.  After rubbing the grease on the hinges, Razor quietly opened the door.
<br><br>
It had been a week since he had started studying the workings of the Freeport Bank.  He knew he had exactly thirty minutes before the guards for the midnight shift would arrive, as they had all week.  It seemed the Freeport guards had made it a habit of smoking and chatting between shifts, under the stars.  
<br><br>
Razor entered the building.
<br><br>
Once inside his gnomish infravision took over in the blackness of the room.  The bank was in total blackness.  He worked his way to the back room were he knew the safe was located. He knew he had to work quickly before the new guards arrived.  Once in front of the large stone vault he again removed his metal rod and began to work the lock on the large vault door. 
<br><br>
Within a few minutes he had free roam of the contents of the vault.
<br><br>
Once inside, like a child in a candy store, Razor began to wildly empty the vault of coin.  He stuffed his bags as full as he could possibly get them.  It was then that Razor felt uneasy.  A sound that was not right.  A feeling that hit him in the gut like a dagger.  
<br><br>
The door to the bank opened.
<br><br>
The guards back early?  Razor ducked behind the main counter in the bank.  He could hear the guards laughing and talking among each other.  His heart began to race.  How could he have miscalculated this?  "I've got ten more minutes." He thought to himself.  He stayed motionless in the shadows.  He knew he did not have many choices at this point.  He would either have to run for the door or kill the two guards.  Razor knew of course he was no match for both guards at the same time.  Somehow he would have to split them up, but how?  
<br><br>
It was in that moment that one of the two guards walked into the back room where Razor was hiding.  Without making a sound Razor withdrew his prized dagger from its sheath.  A Serrated Bone Dirk that he had procured from countless visits to a dungeon in Norrath.  He waited for just the right moment.  The guard entered the room standing directly behind the counter where Razor crouched.  
<br><br>
He waited… waited…    The guard turned his back.  
<br><br>
TWACK!  It was a deadened sound as Razor placed the dagger deep into the guard's back.  Without a sound the guard dropped dead the floor.  He looted the corpse.  Razor breathed a sigh of relief.  "One down and one to go." He thought to himself.  Razor gathered up his bags and snuck towards the exit making sure he stayed in the shadows.
<br><br>
"Who's there?" A voice shouted in the distance.
<br><br>
"Damn" Razor thought to himself.  He knew his cover had been exposed.   
<br><br>
Razor positioned himself behind the door.  He knew the second guard was to great a match for his skills.  He was going to have to make a run for it.  As the guard rounded the corner Razor made dash for the door.  
<br><br>
"STOP!" The guard demanded and withdrew his Rapier from its sheath and just missed Razors head with a "Swoooosh!".
<br><br>
Razor made a beeline for the door not taking a second look back.  He ran as fast as his gnome legs could carry him.  
<br><br>
Once out of town he stopped to count his loot.  One thousand platinum pieces, not a bad night, he thought.
<br><br>
He slung the bag full of loot over his shoulder and head further out of town.  It was a long journey to his next stop, and he was not sure of the directions.  Seeing a man ahead he decided to stop him.
<br><br>
"Hail sir, my name is Razor. Might you know the way to Qeynos, sir?"  Razor asked.
<br><br>
"Hail traveler.  My name is Thott.  You can find Qeynos that direction, sir."  He said pointing.  
<br><br>
"Bless you, sir." Razor said, as he stole the man's wallet.
