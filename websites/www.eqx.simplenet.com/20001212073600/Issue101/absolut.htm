<b>Log Entry 003546.91:</b> The body is in itself not a find of galactic import. It is small, for a planet of its type - the censor craft did not take more than three hours to complete a bio-survey. According to this data, the body suffered superheating by solar flares within the last 13 million years. There are two poles, both with temperatures around two hundred below. From what we can tell, there were either two or three continents originally. We are not sure due to the presence of a spine of lead deposits which cut the main continent in half. It may have a satellite island, however more study of the readings is required. We are sending down a team tomorrow to explore this wasteland. I think that this could be the missing link between the saurians we are now at war with, and their age-old predecessors, thought to have left the walks of the living over one billion years ago.

<em>The contraption was massive, the biggest that Cristle had ever seen. She had known, of course,  that Uncle Glindel was onto something big this time. If only he could persuade Ak'Anon's council to give him more funding for the project, as it was, she had no doubt, the most important thing that had ever come from the City of Clockwork, her home. However, she had not expected it to be quite this huge, quite this overbearing. Running as fast as her little legs could carry her, Cristle raced up the spiral staircase which surround Glindel's latest invention. </em>
<br><br>
<b>Log Entry 003546.92:</b> The team has returned with some interesting information. There is clear evidence of civilization on the planet, albeit extinct for thousands of generations. The planet is a wasteland, an endless string of deserts and barren lands. However, several skeletons were found three kilometers underground, covered by aeons of mud and rocks. They are, in size, slightly taller than that of our own race, although cranial capacity is far inferior to ours. DNA matching reveals almost a point 43 percent match with that of the saurians. Hopefully a second team, which have already been dispatched, will be able to gather more data.
 <br><br>
<em>"Morning, Uncle!"
<br><br>
Cristle greeted her beloved relation with a big kiss. Glindel smiled. "Hello, young Cristle," he replied, taking his eyes off the large panel he was working on, "and how are you today? I hope you've finished your lessons."
<br><br>
Cristle made a face. "Of course, Uncle. How's it coming along?" Glindel's eyes sparkled as he left the panel and opened a large bundle of charts, sprawling them all over a large table. 
<br><br>
"It's good that you should ask that, Chrissy," he said, grinning, knowing that she did not like the diminutive. But Christle had not heard him, or at least she did not notice. Her eyes were fixed on the strange charts now covering the table. 
<br><br>
"What are these?" she inquired. 
<br><br>
"Maps of the stars," said Glindel, awe entering his voice. "For years, we have been able to see only a short distance with our feeble telescopes. My invention will allow us to plot the stars - to see things we have never seen before."</em>
<br><br>
<b>Log Entry 003546.93:</b> It is now certain that whatever primitive life existed on this planet, it was wiped out by the aforementioned solar flares. A new, even more interesting find has also been brought to light. The second team brought back reports of many ruins, concentrated in the same area. Some sort of settlement? Part of an apparently important building was brought back on board. It is extremely old, but from what we can tell, there are strange characters etched on several of the stones used to construct it. The DNA we have received is still insufficient to construct a biovirus to defeat the saurians.
<br><br>
<em>"Uncle, that's amazing!" gasped Cristle, her face lit up with wonder, as she gazed through the enormous lens. Pedaling hard, she got the mechanism to slowly rotate the vast telescope eastwards. 
<br><br>
"What do you see now, dearest?" asked her Uncle, standing behind her and trying to get a good look through the lens as well. 
<br><br>
"It's beautiful..." sighed Cristle, her eyes widening. 
<br><br>
"What is it?" her Uncle repeated. 
<br><br>
"I don't know - a giant orange ball - I think it's the sun." said Cristle. "I have just never seen it at such close range before, though." 
<br><br>
Her Uncle took the lens and squinted through. "Mmm...," he mused, "it IS beautiful." He quickly walked towards the charts, now neatly lined up on the walls. "Haakor...Reenoi...here it is!" he exclaimed, moving his finger slowly along the wall. It had taken them fifteen years to compile such a detailed map of the sky, but it had been worth it. Of course, Glindel wasn't as young as he used to be. The years were beginning to show on his face, he knew. Cristle had often told him to take it easier, but there was so little time to do all he needed to get done. "Wait a minute...my old eyes deceive me," he muttered to himself, "Haakor must be out of alignment..." he walked back to the telescope. Gazing through once again, the old gnome expression stiffened. "Dear Brell..." he stuttered, then fell to the ground, killed instantly by the shock of what he knew was to come.</em>
<br><br>
<b>Log Entry 003546.94:</b> Finally, we have a substantial DNA match. One of the newest skeletons that we picked up contains over thirteen percent saurian DNA. It was recovered on a continent that we had not previously known of, about one hundred kilometers south of gamma continent (the designated name for the continent most far-east on the planet). With this code, we should be able to develop the virus within three hundred hours. The saurians will fall before the might of the Eltherin, and we shall be proud and great once more.
<br><br>
<em>It had been over ten years since Glindel had died that fateful night. Since that day, Cristle had desperately tried to find out what her Uncle had found so fatally distressing about the picture of Norrath's sun. Yet one thing prevented her from finding out, one thing stopped her. It was her Uncle's star charts. He had clearly got them wrong, placing the sun between Haakor and Reenoi, when everybody knew that it could be seen nightly proudly shining over the constellation Xavier. Finally, though, Cristle thought she had worked it out. Finally, she would know. Tonight, what had transpired ten years earlier would be explained.</em>
<br><br>
<b>Log Entry 003546.95:</b> With victory so close, it was snatched cruelly away. The DNA from the skeleton are lacking several vital strands which are present in saurian DNA. The lack of these strands would have made these creatures extremely vulnerable to thermoradion detonations, (such as those found in most major weaponry), thus making this creature, although similar in many respects to the modern saurian, completely incompatible. Since it is clear, however, that these were the predecessors of our enemies, somewhere along the line these primitive beings must have developed their modern-day incredible resilience to our weapons. When this happened is at present beyond speculation.   
<br><br>
<em>The hut was not very large, nor was it inviting. But it was, Cristle knew, enough. She would not have to wait much longer now anyway. She had always kept count of the years, ever since she was young. Cristle couldn't quite remember how long ago that had been. The 'Chart of Days', as she called it, was almost complete. There was only one more space, and then that would be that. Of course, she had tried to warn them all, but they had not listened. Sure, they had noticed the weather getting more tropical, and the fertile forests of the world drying up, but they attributed it to 'planetary alignment'. They weren't far wrong. Cristle lifted her stick from the corner, and looked around the small room that was her home. The walls were lined with charts, some of which remained from those early days, others which she had made or acquired along the way. But Glindel had been right. It would all be over soon. Hobbling out of her hut, she surveyed the scene. The heat was intense, the sun shone strongly in the sky. Looking up, Cristle stared at the sun, almost as though she had locked its gaze with hers and was defying it to do what she knew was to be done. And in that moment, the heat beating down on her, Cristle began to laugh.</em>
<br><br>
<b>Log Entry 003546.96:</b> The genetic code of a saurian is far more complex than that of our species, being as it is ancient beyond compare. Over the millennia, we can only speculate that new layers are cemented down on those which came before. It is very difficult, in fact nigh on impossible, to instigate change in such a creature. Any change that did come would have to have been in direct response to stimuli of immediate danger, where mutation was essential to survival. I believe that this planet could well have been the birthing place for the entire saurian race as it is today. Sadly, though, we may no longer continue our research. Five saurian cruisers are only six days away, and we cannot stay here any longer. We may only despair about what could have been achieved through study of this planet - something which will now never come to pass.
