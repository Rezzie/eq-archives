There are multiple camera angles, including a user-defined one, that basically
let's you move the camera around freely to get whatever view you might like.
It was interesting to see Brad and the other Sony employees expertly move the

Various emotes cause your character to act out the action.  For example,
if you wave, your character will actually move his arm around in the air.
There is also cheer, which raises both arms into the air, and cry, which
causes your character to put his face in his hands and slump his shoulders.
As they continue to add more of these, our in game enjoyment will go up,
even if it just makes us laugh to see the goofy things people do.

There are plans to add an in-game screenshot utility, so you can keep a
journal of your adventures.  Of course, this will not be added until at
least open beta.

form.
