As we age, we expect to grow more wise.  When we are young we encounter more things that seem alien to us.
But the older we are, the more expect to find fewer things that are strange to us.  Yet every day we find
something that is new to us.  It may be a small thing.  It may be a life changing event.  But as we grow older it 
is more often a simple thing that we learn.  And the bigger things are all the more shocking for 
thier rarity.
<br><br>
I am hoping that once I enter Norrath I can start fresh again, that I can learn some of the big 
things all over again.  That every day is a "life changing" day, at least for my character.  That 
is where this game could excel.  Of course that is also the hardest part of it all.
<br><br>
I WANNA PLAY!!  :)
