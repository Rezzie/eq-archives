<em>It turns out we have quite a few talented anglers out there!  Norrath teems with those who have a love of the chase with pole and wrist.  To all those who responded: thank you! And for those with other good spots, please <a href="mailto:oghma@bv.net">write in</a>!

Hail Oghma!
<br><br>
I am Ravenshard, Druid of the 3rd Rank, Clan Elder of the Raven Clan (ooc: Xegony Server), and I too share your enthusiasm for the fine art of fishing!
<br><br>
One of my favorite leisure activities is to stand on the Docks of Qeynos, facing roughly North, and fish my brains out while I attempt to ingrain the true direction of North into my senses - sometimes I even practice some rudimentary spell-casting while I fish (not enough to scare the finny little treats)...
<br><br>
Not only that, but, as a druid, I have noticed that people often leave (or lose?) flasks of water and extra fishing grubs (perhaps the stale ones you mentioned?) lying about on the docks for me to forage... how thoughtful!
<br><br>
I agree with not standing on the dock where the boat arrives wholeheartedly - even last night, someone claimed to have been pickpocketed while fishing off the boat landing; although I suspect that he broke his rod and wouldn't admit to it, a boat had just arrived, and it very well may have been ferrying a rogue in from Erudin (I noted several Barbarians debarking)...
<br><br>
Also, I always fish to build up my own food supplies, yet, ironically, I was able to take some of my excess catch and sell it for a great cause - I did this to help a very nice Barbarian Lady that I have adventured with in the past purchase a spell for which she was a little shy of gold pieces; my modest sea harvest had enough value to supply the missing coin!
<br><br>
Keep up the great work, and let us know about the Fishing Tournament - I'll be brushing up on my fly-casting in the meantime!  =D

For the homesick barbarian angler in the Qeynos/Karana area, there is one perfect spot to cast your line.  Head straight south from Tower 1 in West Karanas (the tower closest to Qeynos Hills).  You'll pass another tower, and just beyond that is a peaceful barbarian village on the river.  In some ways, it's a little Halas away from Halas.  For some reason, no one ever comes here -- not even monsters.  It's a great place to fish, swim, rest, trade, or just hang with your kinfolk.

My favorite fishing spot is in Surefall Glade, just to the left side of the falls. The roar of the water hitting the lake is soothing to the soul and the fine spray from the water impacting the surface is a wonderful way to cool off after a hard day of tracking down poachers and killing the stray Gnoll or wandering Skeleton. Of course you have to be careful not to tangle your line up in the logs holding the Rangers guild up over the lake. Dang fool rangers built their guildhouse right over the middle of the lake. I half suspect they have a secret room with a hole in the bottom right over the best fishing spot in the lake! You also have to beware of the Piranha in the lake. They make it a dangerous proposition to jump in after your beer if you spill it. Best to just let it go and open up a new one. If you happen to hook one of those piranha then be careful, you may lose more than just your bait getting it off your hook!  Despite the piranha and the Rangers guild, the Glade is a nice place to relax and enjoy a good evening of fishing. Just don't mess with the bears!

    I am a Half -Elf ranger named Xaren on Fennin Ro. I Like to fish in the peacefully serenity of Surefall Glade(with a beer in hand of course). I usually fish behind the waterfall, it is a great sight. Also many bears come up and are friendly to rangers like me. My favorite is the huge one named mammoth I usually give him a portion of my catch as he is quite fond of me. Although I like this spot I wouldn't recommend this spot to a newbie. This is because poachers prowl on the bears behind the falls and won't think twice about going after you. When I first entered the world a poacher killed me in the first ten minutes. I am a level 6 now and a fairly good swimmer so I just swim away if they try to start trouble, soon I will stand my ground They are getting annoying! If the poachers start trouble, I just swim to the right of the falls and talk to my trainer while drinking, fishing and sitting by the fire. I annoy him by trying to mooch money off of him, maybe someday he will snap and I'll end up rich or dead...

Heh.  You want to know where the best fishing spot is?  Try the Erudin Docks.  It's got the best view of sunrise and sunset that you'll ever find on Norrath, I'll wager!  Not only that, we've got probably the world's only <em>flying</em> shark.  I call her Killer.  Just for kicks, I throw spells at her to pass the time between castings (line castings, that is) and to hone my magical abilities.  But Killer doesn't care.  She just goes on flying and plopping back into the bay.  It's an entertaining experience, really :)
  <br><br>
When I'm tired of playing with Killer, I hook my special reserve bait onto my line and go angling for my favorite quarry: the ever elusive Giant Piranah that likes to hide under the docks.  If I ever catch him, I'll have him mounted.  Then, I'll feel safe enough to take that stamina-building swimming tour around the isle.
  <br><br>
May your bait bucket and keg never run dry!

My favorite place to fish? Crushbone!
<br><br>
There's a great spot by the bridge to the left of the entrance cave, on the way to the slave pens, where you're out of the way, but can see all the action, while you dangle your worm in the water. Many happy hours I've spent here, peacefully fishing, watching the chaos around me, and the fools bringing trains out of the Emperor's Court. And every once in a while, just for variety, a centurion will respawn across the bridge, and if you're a magic user, as I am, you can get his attention with a spell, and because of the circuitous route, whack him with 2 or three more before he even can get to you, so he's half dead before he lays a finger on you. Knock him off, loot him, and it's back to fishing. Ah, contentment! And as an extra bonus, the sky is so beautiful at dawn and at dusk, a welcome change from the misty dimness of my native Faydark.
<br><br>
Oh, yes, and there is much amusement to be gained from watching the expressions on the faces of the oh-so-serious adventurer parties going by. "You're fishing in *Crushbone*?!?"
<br><br>
The only disappointment is that the fish I catch seem to be no different than the ones at the Felwithe lagoon. I had hoped for strange, exotic, orcish fish, or perhaps bizarre monstrosities and unnatural abominations caused by the pollutants the foul orcs have doubtless dumped into their water supply, but alas, it is not to be. Perhaps in a future patch.

Oghma,
<br><br>
My favorite fishing spot is the Qeynos docks, where the boat comes in.  I too love to watch the sunset or sunrise over the sea, but also the smell of brine, the sound of vendors hawking their wares. I love to watch the strange and exotic people disembark, wondering what tales they have to tell. I even happened upon the GM Jenaya there once in beta.  I was in the right spot at the right time, fishing the night away.
