<p style="text-align: justify"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  I&#146;ve been out of town a lot lately. EQG3 started it. After that I was sick 
  for a week (staying up late and drinking a lot does that to me). By the time 
  I recovered I was on my way back to Las Vegas on a vacation trip. When I got 
  back I was sent to San Francisco for a week for a conference. All of it was 
  a heck of a lot of fun, except the part about being sick for a week.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But that means 
  that for the last month I&#146;ve been out of touch with the game. That&#146;s 
  why I didn&#146;t write an editorial last week. I was still recovering from 
  Vegas and I only had time to edit the stuff for the issue, not to read all the 
  boards and barf out an editorial. Despite how it seems, I try not to just write 
  something to fill space here. I can do that, it&#146;s easy for me. But I really 
  want to stick to writing when I actually have something to say.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So I got off the 
  plane from San Francisco yesterday and went to sleep. I woke up this morning 
  and went to work. Now it&#146;s 10:30 on Friday night and all the editing is 
  done. All that&#146;s left for me to do is to write an editorial. And I still 
  haven&#146;t read the boards. I&#146;m still way out of touch with the community. 
  So how can I write something worth reading?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Easy, don&#146;t 
  write about EverQuest current events.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As I write I&#146;m 
  watching one of my new DVDs. Now, don&#146;t get all freaked out. Don&#146;t 
  call me names when I tell you what it is. It&#146;s the Kindred: The Embraced 
  television series. If you remember it, then you&#146;re probably asking yourself 
  why the hell I would buy such a thing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I kinda liked it, 
  that&#146;s why. And I like to encourage the genre. Other than writing about 
  it here, giving them money is the best way to do that. Yes, it wasn&#146;t a 
  great show. And it didn&#146;t really manage the feel of the game that it was 
  modeled after. But those things I can forgive. These vampires, unlike in the 
  game, can head into the sunlight if they&#146;ve fed (perhaps only the elders, 
  though). This is terribly contrary to the game rules. But if they don&#146;t 
  then the series will be filmed entirely in the dark. It&#146;s really not appealing 
  to people that way. Of course I would have gotten around that problem by centering 
  the series on the ghouls belonging to the main vampires, making their masters 
  mysterious and often unseen. The Nosferatu are not nearly ugly enough. They&#146;re 
  just a bunch of bald people. Again, done probably just to make the series more 
  appealing to a broader audience. The vampires are not nearly feral enough, they 
  never frenzy. Again, probably done for the same motivation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But they did several 
  things right. The casting was good. The Ventrue prince looks just like he should. 
  The Tremere primogen is beautiful and entrancing, as she should be. Even the 
  Gangrel punk enforcer is right. And the Brujah primogen, who gets himself killed, 
  is my favorite. He&#146;s the same guy that you&#146;ve probably seen as the 
  alien assassin on the X-Files. Whenever I see him on TV anyplace, I am forced 
  to call out to him, naming him &#147;Bruhaha&#148;...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, they cast 
  the characters well. The script is weaker than I would like, not biting enough, 
  not lustful or dark enough. But that&#146;s not what the public wants. They 
  want Buffy. They want light-hearted evil. And with characters that are naturally 
  evil as their protagonist, they have to tread very lightly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But now I&#146;m 
  seeing shows that are a bit more dark. I caught an episode of a new show while 
  in San Francisco, the name of which escapes me... But the Internet tells me 
  that it&#146;s call Mysterious Ways. It deals with an Indiana Jones kinda guy, 
  a girl paranormal investigator and a psychiatrist. They seek out paranormal 
  stuff. In the episode that I watched, they were waiting for the dead husband 
  of a psychic couple to come back from beyond the grave and give a sign to his 
  wife. He never comes. I don&#146;t think the show will make it, it&#146;s not 
  entertaining enough, even for me. But I&#146;m still glad to see it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remember when you 
  first got hooked on the X-Files? For me it was the middle of the second season. 
  Finally there was a show on broadcast television that was willing to do justice 
  to one of my favorite genres. It was dark and funny. I appreciated the freak 
  show episode, and I laughed out loud at the Jose Chung episode. The mix of dry 
  humor with the power of the unknown... I was in love (and I have the first season 
  DVDs too, I&#146;ll have you know).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And from the tremendous 
  success of that show we got all the others, Buffy, Vampire and the rest. It 
  really does take a big, sweeping success like that to convince the people with 
  the money that we actually want these things.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the follow-ups 
  also need to succeed. Enough failures and the money people lose faith. But those 
  failures are not the fault of the genre. I think the reason that the Vampire 
  thing failed was because it tried to blend mainstream and hardcore horror-fantasy. 
  That can work (see Buffy the Vampire Slayer for details), but not if it takes 
  itself seriously. You really can&#146;t make likeable vampires and still be 
  doing a serious vampire show. But would the public actually like a serious vampire 
  show?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think so. Make 
  the likeable characters ghouls. Let the vampires be evil, just don&#146;t make 
  them the primary characters. Play the drama and love and happiness in the day, 
  and make the dark the something to fear. It could be done, and people would 
  like it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just don&#146;t 
  stray from the true heart of the genre.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The same can be 
  said for on-line role-playing games. I&#146;m still waiting for the game that 
  stays true to the genre and doesn&#146;t dilute itself in its attempts to include 
  mainstream needs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If either a TV 
  show director or a game designer needs any help with this, I&#146;m available...
