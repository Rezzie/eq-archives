Rivervale - 
<br><br>
Citizens of the Vale have been disturbed by some of their newest, if only temporary, neighbors.  It is rumored that some adventurers have taken a liking to the surroundings of the home of the Halflings.  In most circumstances, the diminutive members of the Vale welcome all visitors.  And they claim to have been gracious with these as well.  But from interviewing them, it is obvious that they are not so comfortable.
<br><br>
These visitors, though this reporter has never seen them, have been reported to travel around carrying various cleaning devices.  It appears that their belief in one of the human gods, referred to as Nife by the visitors, requires that they keep themselves clean at all times.  It also seems that they are trying to convert the citizens of the Vale to their god, spoken in their cult lingo as Gawd.  According to a Deputy of the Vale, one of these visitors, a large barbarian woman, has physically assaulted several citizens.  She grasped them by the feet and raised them far from the ground, upside down.  She then used a stiff wire brush and a large bucket of warm, soapy water to scrub these Halfling.  There are also rumors that some of the citizens of the Vale have gone missing.  One disreputable young Halfling claims to have heard voices coming from within the large pockets of the barbarian woman.
<br><br>
So while traveling the Vale, be wary of anyone carrying a broom, bristle-brush or mop.
