<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Issue 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken advantage of the Christmas
lull to work on a great new section which will contain articles written as
stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;Absor has been promoted to the position of editor and he will be fully
responsible for organising and publishing the new section.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff at EQX would like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year.<br>

<br>
The following people have contributed to the first issue of EQX:<br>
<br>
<strong>Absor</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;I am long time role-player.&nbsp; I won't
say exactly how old I was when I started, but it's been about 19 years...&nbsp; I've been
playing D&amp;D, Call of Cthulu, Champions, and Vampire the Masquerade every week for all
those years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Geez!<br>
<br>
<strong>Ian Ash</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian Ash is usually in the office when he
is not playing on the computer or spending time with his family. Even tho his co-workers
and friends would expect him to play an evil character to cut loose when online, Ian is
inescapably always the good guy. Likes to Draw, listen to loud music and write. &lt;g&gt;<br>
<br>
<strong>Kit&nbsp;&nbsp;^..^</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been celebrating the
return of my long lost <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/fowles/15/eqfun.htm">humor
page</a>, which had previously vanished under mysterious circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have
recently finished a Masters degree in Tourism Management, and I'm busy searching for a job
(unsucessfully :).<br>
