I can't believe it, but once again I am being inexorably drawn into the popular complaint of the week.  Drawn in and drown as surely as if I had been a victim of the fabled Siren.  But then you folks don't really expect anything else from me, do you?  I certainly hope not…
<br><br>
I loved reading the title of the first post I saw about this on one of the EverQuest boards out there.  It was something like:  <b><em>GM Harassment!</b></em>  I love reading those threads, for several reasons.  I'll admit that the primary reason is simple amusement.  I often find myself entertained by what people are willing to call harassment or abuse.  And I'm the kind of person that notices inconstancies in these things.  I find it interesting to see what details the accuser has left out of the tale, especially when they are attacking an entity that simply cannot respond.  Most of the time these things are obviously just angry players looking to pick a fight, and all but the most anti-Verant nutjobs (I've taken a liking to that phrase lately…) see this and it quickly becomes a non-issue.
<br><br>
Not so with the latest.  It seems to have a life of its own.
<br><br>
I'll summarize.  You can find the details on just about any EverQuest site.  Remember, all of this information is my interpretation of the facts as told by one angry player.
<br><br>
A woman was playing and found herself, for some unknown reason, the target of harassment by another player.  Among other things, that player /petitioned the name of her character, apparently saying that it was offensive.  At first a GM decided not to change the name.  But a few days later she was told that her name was going to be changed because of a /petition.  It seems that she was given no choice about what name to change to.
<br><br>
This angered her husband.  He /petitioned and insisted on talking to a GM.  The apprentice Guide that responded was polite, but unable to help.  The husband insisted on getting the help of a Verant employee.  He was told to stop the conversation, but chose not to.  After three warnings, he was booted from the game.
<br><br>
That's based only on the husband's story.  I left out a few things, like the husband saying: "you and your group is destroying many long hours of actual good times not to mention, my family's happiness during the holidays. Thanks."  This only five minutes after the apprentice Guide says hello to him.
<br><br>
There are a lot of things to remember here when you read these claims of harassment.  First and foremost, remember that the player is angry.  Perhaps rightfully so, but perhaps not.  People get angry over things one day they wouldn't blink at the next day.  And when people are angry, they do a lot of things that don't always make sense.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
I once worked as an assistant manager at Crown Books.  One day I was called to the front of the store to deal with an irate customer.  I found this guy yelling at one of our female cashiers.  Everything had stopped as customers and employees alike watched this guy tear into the girl.  When I explained to him that I was the assistant manager, he turned his anger to me.
<br><br>
His problem was that <b>someone</b> in this store had sold his child (I don't remember if it was a daughter or a son) a book that he considered pornography.  I wish I could remember the book, I really do.  But this was more than ten years ago.  I do remember that it was a text book in several of the local schools, and that we sold a lot of them to high school kids.  He was red in the face angry about our selling that book to a minor.  I calmly explained to him that we sold nothing that was considered pornography (Crown at that time didn't carry anything worse than romance novels), and that the book was a text book in the local schools.
<br><br>
He yelled at me some more, sputtering terribly.  When he realized that I wasn't going to get mad at him, nor was I going to punish anyone at the store, he changed his demands.  He then insisted on cash back for the book.  I explained to him, still startlingly calm, that Crown Books does not give cash back for returns (I think they do now, damn them!).  I offered to allow him to exchange the book for another, but he insisted on cash back.  Several more times I explained to him the store policy, and that I would not give him cash.  I gave him the customer service number.  He yelled a bit more.  He then stormed out.
<br><br>
While he was gone a lot of the customers wondered that I was so calm.  Honestly, I was calm because I was in shock.
<br><br>
The guy came back a few minutes later.  He was <b>really</b> angry now.  It seems that he had tried to call the customer service number, and nobody answered.  It was after dark here on the west coast and the service people were on the east coast.  I explained to him that they were probably closed and that he would have to call them tomorrow.  More yelling.  Eventually he tossed the book on the counter and stormed out.
<br><br>
Customers and employees alike wondered why I didn't throw the guy out.  He was there yelling for at least ten minutes, and likely more if you include the time before I got there.  I still wonder why I put up with it.  Let's suppose that I was needed to run a register at the time (I wasn't).  How fair is it to the other customers for me to not help them while I let this guy yell at me?  How fair is it that I let him yell at me at all?  Don't I have rights?  Whatever his problem was, it shouldn't have been a problem with me or any of our employees.  We did nothing wrong.  He caused the young cashier that he latched onto when he first arrived a lot of distress.  She was shaken by the time I got there.  This guy was wrong.  Even if he was my customer, he was wrong.  His problem was with his child, perhaps that child's school, and the policy makers at Crown.  Taking it out on me solved nothing.
<br><br>
He had probably just finished dealing with his teenager.  He had probably just had a truly emotional situation when he discovered a book that he found offensive in the possession of his child.  I can only hope that I got most of his anger and that his teenager didn't have to deal with it.
<br><br>
The very next day the guy came back and apologized to me for what he had done.
<br><br>
That was a wonderful thing.  I wonder if that will ever happen for Verant.  How many of these angry customers will calm down and actually say that they were wrong?
<br><br>
Now I'm not saying that all of the people with complaints about the customer service are wrong.  I'm not sure that the lady's character had an improper name.  I would call it marginal.  But changing the character's name should in no way destroy a family's holiday.  My suspicion is that this guy was far more angry at the goofball that was harassing his wife than he was with Verant.  I know that I would be pissed if someone was harassing my wife.  But folks, the trick here is to direct your anger at the right people.  And make sure that you really have a reason to be angry.  I feel for that apprentice Guide.  Having to stand there and be berated over something that is not your fault and beyond your control is not pleasant.  No matter how wronged you feel, don't be the bad guy yourself.
