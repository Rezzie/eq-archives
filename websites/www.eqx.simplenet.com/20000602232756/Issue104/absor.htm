The task for our staff this week was to come up with a few favorite things from EQX past.  Not an easy bit of work, that's for sure.  The basic idea was to keep it to two or three things that you liked best about EQX, something that you did, something someone else did, and your favorite EQX moment (meaning nearly anything else).  It's one tough job, to find just a few things over the last two years of wonderful goofiness that has gone on here.
<br><br>
Let me start with the thing that I wrote that I liked the most.  As a writer, I know that I'm a hack.  I read a lot, way too much really.  And I know good writing when I see it.  But that does not mean that I can write well.  Up until about two years ago, I figured that at some point I would sit down and become a writer.  I knew that I could do it.  The thought that I might not have the skill never crossed my mind.  After all, I've read the best, I should know all of the tricks.  If there's one thing that working on EQX each week had taught me it's that I was an idiot to think that writing is easy, that reading was all the training I would need.
<br><br>
To be a good writer, you need to actually write.  Reading over my early editorials, I can tell that I was spending my time on those things just avoiding writing.  I was afraid.  Writing something that you know others will read (and especially an intelligent and critical crowd of the type that play games AND read) is truly terrifying.  With my editorials, the thing that gave me the strength to push through that fear was writing about something that I knew very well.  When I started writing about my weekly gaming sessions, and about roleplaying in general, I got my feet under me.  I overcame that fear, for the most part.
<br><br>
But I hadn't taken the big step, trying to write a completely fictional tale and letting all of you read it.
<br><br>
And then we received some pre-beta screen shots.  And someone came up with the idea of writing stories about those pictures.  And I forced myself to write one.  The first one was reasonable, I think.  And nobody sent me any hate mail.  That was kind of you.  But it was the second story, the one that I wrote in response to the picture of the library of Erudin, that I'm most proud of.  It's not great.  I'm not sure that it's even good.  But in it I tried my best to tackle the things that I think are hardest to write.  I tried to write a character exposition.  I wanted to see if I could give the reader some sense of what Absor is like.
<br><br>
It was called <a href="../Issue43/quest.htm">The Greatest Quest</a>, and it appeared in Issue 43.  It's certainly not a great tale, but I'm actually proud of it.  I guess I'm also proud of it because it's the first thing that I ever wrote that was published (though butchered a bit) in a book that appeared in a bookstore, <em>EverQuest; the official players guide</em>.  It lead up to one of my favorite personal moments.  I went in to purchase the book the second that it came out.  I was standing there watching the clerk ring it up.  We chatted briefly about EverQuest, he said something about how he was thinking about playing it.  I said something about how he should, it's a great game.  I paid and wandered out.
<br><br>
The whole time a little voice inside my head is yelling at me, "Tell him that you're in the book!  Show him the pages where your words are!"  I never did.  But my little voice and I were chuckling about it for a few days afterwards.
<br><br>
Picking just one thing that someone else did for EQX as a favorite is obviously impossible.  I could list a hundred things.  But I have to stick to my own rules and only pick one.  As editor, it's tempting to cheat here and start a list of things that I would mention if I didn't have to pick just one, you know, like when Bugs straps on boxing gloves... there'll be none a' dis!  And none o' dat!  In fact, I just deleted a list just like that.  After all, nobody will be able to stop me from publishing it...
<br><br>
But I'll pick just one anyway.  Gads, what an impossible task!
<br><br>
As the guy that sees absolutely everything that goes into EQX, and most things that don't, I think I'll pick the one that I was most pleased to get.  Back in the distant past somewhere in the bowels of Verant (989 Studios then, I think), someone had decided that there needed to be a tale from the perspective of each race and or religion.  Tales to get the point of view out there.  Now I don't know if this was Friar's own idea, or if it was generated from above.  But when I got that first story from Friar, I was so pleased.  For me it meant that someone in the big meat grinder there at Verant was aware of the desperate need for myth and tales in Norrath.  And they were going to allow us to be the source for those tales.
<br><br>
Friar, whose secret identity is Charles Flock, was known to the Tanarus community as a smart-ass.  His wonderful talent for one liners made him a personal favorite of mine (and Archy as well, like minds and all).  When I read that first story to find out that the guy was also a damn good writer, I was all smiles.  I'm hard pressed to pick one of those stories, but read <a href="../Issue30/ogre.htm">Groal's Tale</a>, from issue 30 and you'll see what I mean.
<br><br>
And I need to cheat a little bit here and mention Ozymandius as well.  He also sent us several brilliantly written, semi-official stories from Norrath, basically taking over when Friar discovered that he didn't have enough time to write anymore.  Not only does the game owe a ton to Ozy for leading and establishing the Guide program, but we should keep in mind that he helped build the myth of Norrath as well.  
<br><br>
Of course this has also lead to one of my greatest EQX disappointments, that this series of tales were never finished.
<br><br>
I know exactly what Oghma is going to remember as his favorite moment from EQX.  And I'm not even cheating by reading his article first.  I know.  And I agree.  By far the most memorable thing for me about EQX were the meetings.  We meet on IRC weekly, more or less, to talk about EQX and brainstorm ideas.  Some of the funniest things that I have ever seen have come from those meetings.  In fact, let me see if I have any of those logs here somewhere...
<br><br>
Ah.  I bet Oggie's gonna love seeing this again!
<br><br>
<em>&lt;Oghma&gt; BTW, EQX may have it's first groupie
<br>
&lt;Oghma&gt; at least I do...
<br>
&lt;Absor&gt; groupie?
<br>
* Oghma blushes.
<br>
&lt;Arch&gt; An Oghma groupie
<br>
&lt;|Wynn&gt; oghma has a groupie
<br>
* Arch trembles
<br>
&lt;Absor&gt; Talk, short one
<br>
&lt;|Wynn&gt; a "number one fan"
<br>
&lt;Arch&gt; uh oh
<br>
&lt;Oghma&gt; yeah i got someone going through each of my articles and stories and gushing over them
<br>
&lt;Arch&gt; When she yells "I'm not going to be ignored!", you better run for it.
<br>
&lt;Arch&gt; she/he?
<br>
&lt;Oghma&gt; "You seem to say what I'm thinking, but better than I can express it" la la la la la
<br>
&lt;Oghma&gt; she
<br>
&lt;Arch&gt; OoooooOOOOoooooh :)
<br>
&lt;Absor&gt; Weeee!  We've made it!
<br>
&lt;Absor&gt; Hehe
<br>
&lt;Oghma&gt; yeah just you wait
<br>
&lt;Absor&gt; # of hits means nothing when you got groupies!
<br>
&lt;Oghma&gt; I'll telling her that arch writes way better than I ever could
<br>
&lt;Absor&gt; lol
<br>
&lt;Oghma&gt; and he looks better too
<br>
&lt;Arch&gt; she'll bump off all the other EQXers to make room for More OGHMA
<br>
&lt;|Wynn&gt; haha
<br>
&lt;Oghma&gt; there isn't enough room in this meeting for more oghma
<br>
&lt;Arch&gt; EQX:  All Oghma, All the time!
<br>
&lt;|Wynn&gt; issue #53, 100% oghma
<br>
&lt;Arch&gt; Good idea.
<br>
&lt;Arch&gt; Goodnight!
<br>
* Arch walks away
<br>
&lt;Absor&gt; I'm all for it
<br>
&lt;|Wynn&gt; any objections?
<br>
&lt;Oghma&gt; snort
<br>
&lt;Arch&gt; He's busy answering fan mail :)
<br>
&lt;Oghma&gt; lazy bastages
<br>
&lt;|Wynn&gt; okay let's start this meeting?</em>
<br><br>

And several minutes later, I had to ask if we were ready to start the meeting.  Meetings often run for over an hour, and during that time, we talk business for at least ten minutes.  It's a terrible shame that most of those early meetings have been lost to history.  In know that if you were to read them, like the snippet above, you'd be hard pressed to gather up a chuckle about it.  You'd probably give me a courtesy smile, then wander off shaking your head.  But in my life I can't think of anything funnier than those early meetings.  Some of the sharpest and wittiest people I've ever know have graced this magazine.  Wynn, Ian, Razor, Arch and Oghma...  put those folks in a small chat room with little to snack on and you'll be laughing so hard that you can't type.  Add to them the more recent or less active staffers, like Nepenthia, Onnie, Elaan, Dach, and Aklar and the whole Internet would probably light up like a Christmas tree.  I would give up just about anything to gather all of the past and present EQX staffers into the same room and record the results.  I think we'd have another Blair Witch on our hands.
<br><br>
Thanks to all of them, and all of you.  It's been a great two years.
