    EARTH TO NORRATH</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every 
    once in awhile, or perhaps more often than that, I enter into one of those 
    day-dreaming zones of unreality where it&#146;s necessary for someone to repeat, 
    &#147;Earth to Nep, Earth to Nep! Are you there Nep?&#148; Usually a few iterations 
    is enough to bring my focus back into the same room as the person calling 
    for my attention and asking me to respond to them. During those moments of 
    spacing out, however, my daydreaming self essentially loses track of the presence 
    and the human existence of the one nearby until, somehow, reconnection is 
    made and I can see and attend to the very real person standing by me.<br>
    So, it&#146;s easy, I think, as people become involved in the imaginary world 
    of Norrath, for all of us to enter into a kind of disconnected state that 
    can, if we&#146;re not careful, separate us from the real people behind the 
    characters of players and staff alike in Everquest with serious repercussions 
    on our behavior toward each other. Every once in awhile, it might be a good 
    idea to shout out, &#147;Earth to Norrath, Earth to Norrath&#148; simply to 
    remind ourselves that connected to us by keyboard (unless there are now intergalactic 
    aliens also playing Everquest), is a human individual not all that different 
    from each of the other members of the EQ community.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
    the person we are playing with or the staff member we are dealing with is 
    seen as a dehumanized persona or a symbolic figurehead, then, it seems our 
    ethical or social obligations from real life often take a vacation from the 
    interchanges that follow. Behavior and attitudes that few would espouse in 
    daily life, such as lying or false manipulation or power mongering become 
    more commonplace. Communication devolves into debates or battles or statistics 
    argued between two sides, either of which may choose to regard the other as 
    a hero, an object, an idiot, or, worse, a demon. Whether it be a person posting 
    to a board who has entered into a fantasy universe where it is possible to 
    forget that behind the figurehead of a Producer, or a Game Designer, or a 
    GM is a real person or whether it&#146;s a person sitting at a desk at Verant 
    taking refuge in corporate rhetoric that boxes a real person into a labeled 
    player object, there are frequent moments in the Everquest world where we 
    all forget that the person we are talking to or about lives in a real world 
    with problems and concerns and issues of which we have no idea.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
    is, of course, impossible to know who that person really is in the give and 
    take of the game and the internet boards. Nor is there a fast or accurate 
    way to always determine if the circumstances they might claim or post about 
    are true. There&#146;s no way to tell. If someone posts that he has met the 
    girl of his dreams (insert reverse genders if you choose), readers can find 
    it hard to figure out if this is roleplay or a message from the real person. 
    If someone likewise posts and speaks of a terminal illness or even says that 
    life is too hard and suicide is the only option, it could be real or it could 
    be someone posting in that manner for other reasons. If a representative of 
    a game company connects with a player through the boards or in game, he or 
    she is subject to the same atmosphere and can find it easy to objectify and 
    dehumanize the other person.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Playing 
    a character, whether in strict role-play or not, makes the situation even 
    more complicated. When we play, we are all simultaneously ourselves in real 
    life and our perceived characters in the game. At the same time our fingers 
    are typing madly to keep our character living and breathing in the imaginary 
    world, our real life selves are reacting emotionally and physically to the 
    experiences of our characters. (Yes, the game still gives me that instant 
    of queasiness when Nep falls down the face of a cliff.) Thus, at the same 
    time a character might go running screaming from an ogre or playfully rebut 
    an amorous ranger, there is also an interchange on two levels between the 
    role-playing individual and the person playing the other character. If the 
    circumstances are positive and if time permits, we may begin to get to know 
    the character both as the character and the person behind it. With luck, we 
    may even find a friend. The flip side of this duality is that if we run into 
    negative circumstances such as the endless trains causing painful deaths that 
    happened to me last night -- or kill-stealing or ninja looting or people promising 
    friendship who really just want to use a particular attribute of another&#146;s 
    character -- then the intensity of dealing with the problem can make it even 
    more difficult to see through the illusion of Norrath to the real persons 
    involved.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
    can think of many times when people have engaged my characters in ways I&#146;m 
    certain they never would have responded to me as a person had we been playing 
    pen and pencil games over a table or discussing the same subject in real life. 
    Certainly, it is easy to invent an illusion or untruth about another and to 
    use the nebulous form of our player characters to persuade others that what 
    is being said is, in fact, truth. It&#146;s easy to say, &#147;Oh I don&#146;t 
    need a bard &lt;or insert class or race&gt;&#148; or &#147;They&#146;re a 
    newbie, it&#146;s ok for me to cheat them out of their kill.&#148; or whatever. 
    After all, as long as we are in the separate fantasy universe, truth can seem 
    relative and humanity a forgotten illusion. In each of these instances, however, 
    the lost balance between interacting as role-players and connecting as humans, 
    resulted in problems, frustrations and sometimes even emotional pain.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
    a way, the ages-old experience of militaries that dehumanize the other side 
    gets played out again in imaginary worlds. As in a war, an otherwise ethical 
    person, &#147;forgets&#148; that the one he or she faces online is equally 
    real, breathing, thinking and feeling. We interact with the &#147;Ogre-ness&#148; 
    of the person or the &#147;GM-ness&#148; without simultaneously remembering 
    the man or woman or boy or girl at the other keyboard. When we are in this 
    fantasy state and when we forget the reality of the people we interact with, 
    then derogatory names and unethical behavior arise. A person, who would smile 
    and shake hands with a developer or game god (in MUDs) if they were meeting 
    in public, feels no barrier to making death threats or posting flaming rhetoric 
    online. Someone who would cook you dinner and banter the evening away in a 
    friendly living room, doesn&#146;t think twice about stealing the spawn you&#146;ve 
    waited 6 hours for. It&#146;s like becoming split, disjointed personalities 
    when we don&#146;t stop to hold the parts together with our ethical sensibilities 
    and individual social consciences. Of course, I realize that it is a commonplace 
    wisdom that all gamers are eccentrics and social misfits, but then there go 
    the labels again, displacing the value of each individual in favor of broad 
    stereotypes. The reality is that gamers are all people and in order for our 
    online community to flourish, it&#146;s important to come out of the fantasy 
    world enough to remind ourselves to reconnect on a human and ethical level 
    with each other even as our characters play out of our imaginations in Norrath.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I&#146;m 
    not sure how long it takes a playing community to evolve a system in game 
    where real life social ethics reside side-by-side with the interactions of 
    fantasy. Out of game, such as on the message boards or in interactions among 
    players or between gamers and the company running the game, however, it seems 
    reasonable that we work hard to always remember the person we are encountering 
    is more than the persona we first meet. If we accept the premise that in or 
    out of game we can set aside common decency and respect in favor of an illusion 
    of disconnection on the human level, then, I believe, we will not achieve 
    a cohesive community within the game or the Internet. Some may be comfortable 
    with that. For me, community is what is important - and community is always 
    made up of individuals, each of whom has the right to tap me on the shoulder 
    and call, &#147;Earth to Nep&#148;, knowing that I can step back outside my 
    fantasy experience and see and respond to them as a person.</font></p>
