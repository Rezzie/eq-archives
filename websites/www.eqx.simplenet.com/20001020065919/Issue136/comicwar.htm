    &quot;Comic War&quot;?</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    I guess this all started with <i>EQVault's</i> unveiling of their new online, 
    &quot;professionally penned&quot; comic <i>EverQuests</i>. Now, whether the 
    commotion was caused by the comic itself, their claim of &quot;the first (and 
    therefore best) adventure comic that takes place in Norrath&quot;, or <i>EverCrest's</i> 
    very humorous mockery of the comic I do not know. But it seems to have turned 
    into an all out &quot;war&quot;. If the <i>EverQuests</i> comic was a tangible 
    object, it would have been flamed to ashes weeks ago. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    The arguments against the new comic go like this, with my comments about them 
    afterwards: (Note: Opinions were gathered from flamers and decent people alike. 
    I apologize to those who are offended by being grouped with the flamers).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-<b>EverQuests 
    is NOT the first adventure comic based on EverQuests</b>. I'm a laid back 
    guy and I'm not gonna squabble about <i>EverQuests</i> being first or not 
    and what type of comic <a href="../credits/bardlog.htm"><i>Bard's Log</i></a> 
    is (it's kinda both).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-<b>The 
    dialogue is cheesy and the plot is horrible</b>. The dialogue is that of a 
    comic book of that type. It's ridiculously clear in order to inform people 
    who have never played <i>EverQuest</i> before. Anybody could pick this comic 
    up and understand what is going on, while you have to be an <i>EQ</i> player 
    to get <i>EverCrest</i> most of the time. As for <i>Bard's Log</i>, there're 
    elements, but the characters grew into their own people and I rarely even 
    think of <i>EverQuest</i> when drawing the comic.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-<b>Dark 
    Elf butts</b>. Sure she's half-naked. So is the High Elf on all the <i>EverQuest</i> 
    boxes though ;). Although it is offending to some, I can't help laughing when 
    I see it, thanks to <i>EverCrest</i>. (Bear with me; while reading the comic, 
    fill in the Dark Elf's speech bubble with &quot;Look at my blue butt&quot; 
    whenever there's a back view. Its funny... ok, I'll stop)</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-<b>It's 
    just &quot;following the crowd&quot;</b>. Maybe that's true. Maybe <i>EQVault</i> 
    just thought &quot;Oh, <i>EQX</i> has some comics that are very popular, <i>EverCrest</i> 
    is very popular, maybe we can be popular as well. But we can be better and 
    'professionally penned' &quot; but maybe they didn't, and I doubt they did. 
    I'm sure (throw rocks at me if I'm wrong) Barry Blair offered to do a comic 
    based on <i>EverQuest</i> for <i>EQVault</i>, and <i>EQVault</i> let him. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    This is where it gets personal... Two things that Drysart and I have in common 
    are: We do humor comics, we both got rejected by <i>EQVault</i>. Although 
    Drysart on a much larger scale. I sent work to <i>EQVault's</i> &quot;Featured 
    Art&quot; section and their &quot;Race Art section&quot; but they were never 
    posted. I didn't know why because they never gave a reason. I didn't ask, 
    I'm a laid back guy. I took my work to <i>EQX</i> and I love it there. As 
    stated in that fateful <i>EverCrest</i> comic, <i>EQVault</i> didn't post 
    the work because it wasn't &quot;professional looking&quot;. I think all work 
    should be posted. If a person has the enthusiasm in a game to spend time and 
    draw a picture of their character (no matter how &quot;bad&quot; it looks. 
    Who are we to judge?) they should be allowed to have it posted. Sure, it's 
    <i>EQVault's</i> webspace and they don't have to post anything, but look where 
    it got them with <i>EverCrest</i>. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    Which leads me to think... maybe they scrambled to get something professional 
    after seeing that they lost a now popular comic that they had previously rejected. 
    I'm going to conclude with that because I'm starting to rant. This is just 
    what's going through my head as I think about other daily stuff. Are we cartoonists 
    fighting a war here? Back in the day, newspapers fought to get the best comic 
    strips because comic strips got readers. Maybe history repeats itself. Ooooooooooooooooooooh 
    Scary. Anyway, this is Sir Maximus, signing off. Flame me all you want. I'm 
    a laid back guy ;)</font></p>
