  In Halas, at my favorite tavern, and sitting at a largest table, I can often be found telling stories to my fellow brothers, while eating bread and drinking.  Today was no different than any other.
<br><br>
"I often enjoy traveling to Nektulos.  Not that there is anything particularly pleasing about this area, or that I'm treated with anymore respect that a great Barbarian warrior so deserves.   I just feel compelled to take the time out of my busy schedule to travel there and slay every blue guard I can find.  Not only do I kill them, I cut them apart limb by limb by limb.   I ignore the pleas from the small inkies.  In a mad rage I scream DEATH TO YOU ALL!
<br><br>
"What? This seems cold and hostile to you?"
<br><br>
"Let me tell you my story brothers." 
<br><br>
I sat back in my chair and slurped down a huge gulp of mead.
<br><br>
 "It was my first dungeon crawl in Najena.  I was running across Nektulos with my brother.  Nektulos is a known hunting ground of the Dark elf or "inkies" and is protected by guards.  With my head down, and running along the path, I was daydreaming about the many Ogre we were going to have the gratification of killing."
<br><br>
"My pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the shouts of a tiny voice."
<br><br>
"I will rid the lands of yet another disgusting Barbarian.  DIE!!!"
<br><br>
"Before I could look up to see this ignoramus who dare shout at us, I felt the pierce of several swords in my body.   Grimacing in pain, I looked up to see three Inkie guards wearing full plate and wielding long swords.   Knowing that we could not win the fight my brother ordered me to run towards Freeport as he stayed behind to provide me time to escape; A deed that would cost him his life.
<br><br>
Barely escaping death myself, I spent the next few months recovering in Freeport.  After my wounds healed I became very enraged by the impromptu attack from those disgusting blue guards. I returned to Halas to continue my training with my master. I vowed I would get my revenge.
<br><br>
"Now Brothers I am a full-grown warrior. I have the strength of ten humans.  Those puny inkies are no match for my sword.  I yearn to hear their pleads before I pierce them with my sword.  So my brother I beg you.  Join me in my quest to rid the land of these evil dark elves forever!  Together we shall destroy them all!"
<br><br>
The drunken barbarians cheer with me in approval, but quickly we return to our drinking.
<br><br>
After several hours my vision blurred and the room grew dark.   
<br><br>
I passed out.
