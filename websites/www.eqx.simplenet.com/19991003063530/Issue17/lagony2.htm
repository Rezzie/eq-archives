Oh the Lagony!
<br><br>
Absor went back to surveying his friend’s predicament and surmised that perhaps only
praying to the Sony Gods would help.
<br><br>
"Dangeth!" Archanalia exclaimed then said, "I shall be back." Then he vanished, and
all his goods went with him.  Absor stood around a while then Archanalia reappeared
there in the hall.
<br><br>
"Better now?"  Asked Absor.
<br><br>
"I had to relog---er, I mean I had to Pray hard to get released…yeah…that’s what I
did."

"Then let’s be off!"
<br><br>
As the pair rounded the corner, they came across a site that was stranger than the
Archanalia’s backside embedded in stone!  Stranger than the ghostly trolls!  It was
their friend Kit, who was faced toward a wall and kept walking directly into it.  His
feet kept moving, as if he were a machine, driving him into the hard stone wall.
<br><br>
"Kit," they cried, tapping him on the shoulder, doing their best to shake him back to
consciousness.  Still his feet moved on and his head continued to buffet against the
coarse stone, ‘til finally he vanished much the way Archanalia had earlier after…
umm… praying.

The pair continued.  This dungeon was surely a place of strange uncontrolled magics
which attacked without provocation.  What else could explain these random events?
<br><br>
Ahead in the passage was the dwarf who had bumped Archanalia earlier.  Archanalia
wanted to know just what magics had been worked on him to put him into the roof,
and so he ran to the tiny man where he stood on a ramp up to the second level of
the dungeon.  Archanalia bumped the dwarf just once, and suddenly the dwarf went
skidding up the ramp and through the air.

"Wooooaaaa AAAAHHHHHhhhhhh ……. !!!!!!"
