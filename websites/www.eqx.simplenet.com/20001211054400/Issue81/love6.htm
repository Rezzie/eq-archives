<b>Part Six</b>
<br><br>
<em>The Bard, with a sadness shining in his eyes, pulled out the third slip of paper and began to read... the accompaniment changing subtly to a marching beat, a deeper chord...
</em>

<br><br>
	As Hargor began speaking the strange words that I will never understand, I looked over to t'Ceira and mouthed, "I love you, Hon." Feeling as giddy as an ogreling who just killed his first halfling.  I watched the glowing lights form on his hands and then pass onto t'Ciera and then me.  It seemed as though the lights and words were reaching a crescendo, my heart beating wildly as if I were riding into battle with my brothers, then a blinding bright light... Darkness... and... Quiet.
<br><br>
     I awoke to the sound of distant thunder and the sensation of cool water pelting my skin.  Opening my eyes, I noticed that I was in a very dense forest, a very familiar forest.  I was home, back in the Feerot.  Not Neriak, not the Dark Forest, Nektulos, and NOT where I expected to be!  Taking in a quick deep breath of the heavy humid air I shouted as loud as my booming voice could, "HARGOR! DECEIVER!"   My voice broke as all of my pain and anguish struck me.  I was back home.  Yelling in a sob I cried out to my beloved, "TCEIRA...WHERE... ARE...YOU-U-u-u-u..."  Losing any sense of control, I leaned back on the wide trunk of a tree, punching the ground until my knuckles bled, crying so hard that my throat hurt and breath was coming in short gasps.  I let my passions sweep over me and took out my blinding agony and loneliness on the helpless tree I was next to.  When the tree was torn from the ground and a pulpy mass at my feet, my mind began to clear, but only a bit. 
<br><br>
My still clouded mind tried to put the pieces of the puzzle together.  Diane had showed me ways of thinking that I had never known, but it didn't help me now.  Nothing made sense.  None of the Enlightenment that she spoke of stilled my racing heart, my clouded mind, or my utter confusion.  I only knew that Hargor had lied... deceived... had betrayed.  Had betrayed me and my beloved!  Hargor said t'Ceira and I would be together, he said we would be in Neriak together.  He said he was happy for us.  He lied.  All I knew at that moment was I had to get back to Freeport, I had to find t'Ceira!
<br><br>
Jumping up I noticed that my boots were gone.  Looking at my arms and legs I saw that all of my things were gone.  It took me years to get all of that stuff, and it would be hard to get back to anywhere without my axes and my armor.   With heavy heart and bleary eyes I took a step and kicked a small pouch.  Grumbling some oath or another, I picked it up.  Inside was a note, a book, and some pitiful provisions.  Since I didn't read so well, I decided to go to the place where the smart ogres were, the Shadow Knights of  Oggok.
<br><br>
     I had been meaning to return home, but not like this.  The conquering hero, yes, but not naked and begging for help from the knights.  They don't much like plain old warriors for some reason, but I went to them anyway.  When I got to the chamber of the Shadow Knight guild, I approached one of the high muckety mucks apprehensively.  I didn't want a fight.  I explained to him the situation and held up the note.
<br><br>
	He said, "That is why you a craknek, you too stupid." He snatched the note and read it to me...
<br><br>
<em>Dear Darvinn,
<br><br>
	I wanted you to know that I care for you very much, and that our time together was fun, but you need to know something.  It wasn't real.  I don't love you and I never could.  You are nothing but a big, smelly goon that kept me from harm until I could get what I needed.  You have served your purpose, and I thank you for it.  Go back to your brothers you talk about so much, maybe they will take you back if you don't tell them that you loved a Teir'dal.  Please, Darvinn, don't come looking for me, I want to get on with my life and we just can't be together anymore.  Once again, thanks for all of your help, I know you will be happier with your own kind, I know I will.  
<br><br>
 Sincerely, t'Ceira</em>
<br><br>
	The room began to spin and grow dark.  I found myself sitting on the floor looking up at the Knight in dumbfounded shock, his face looking like some twisted grinning mask.  He seemed to be laughing but I heard no sound, just the pounding of my heart.  Very quickly I regained some composure, getting up I tried to look like I expected the news but it was too late.  He wadded up the note and threw it at me.  "Get out of here, you have no place with the Shadow Knights!"  I guess he pushed me to the door, because I was on my way out of the room.  He even kicked me on the backside as I moped out of the chamber and into the hall.  Shambling down the passage, I heard the belly laughs of the knights as they joked about the ogre who would love an inky.  As I made my way to the center of Oggok, my thoughts were swimming but one thing stood out, <em>this ain't real</em>.
<br><br>
             Days turned into weeks, weeks to months, and I slowly began to focus on being a craknek of Oggok.  Tried desperately to put <em>her</em> out of my mind.  Smashing lizardmen with my brothers was wonderful.  Feeling the bile of my enemy running over my hands was very, very inspiring!  But, something was wrong, something was always missing.  I tried not to think about it, about her, about our hours and hours of talk.  She never gave a sign, not even an inkling that someday she wouldn't want me anymore.  I tried not the think about the way she tilted her head and put her hands on her hips, the delicate crinkle of her nose and the beautiful fire in her eyes... the way she wrapped her arms around me, the warm little ball she made next to me when we slept.  My soul cried out to her, though my voice was only a bellow of hurt... "TCEIRA!  I love you!"
<br><br>
         Then one day while I stood in line at Tew Bie, I overheard Chef Dooga tell someone to take this or that to Neriak, Neriak!  Butting in line I ask the chef about the Gobbler, I wanted to know what I had to do to get her back, to have my little elfie.  The old ache came back, it is strange, this kind of pain, there is no visible wound, but it hurts more deeply than any sword or dagger, and never seems to heal.
<br><br>
          Taking the meat the chef gave me and all of my belongings, I started out on my way.  I told my fellows that I had to go, we hugged and waved, but no tears, this was the way of things.  I knew the desert was close to the swamp where the trolls lived, but I was not too sure how to get across it.  There were many hazards and very powerful creatures that stood in my way, but I knew that I had to get to her. Nothing could stop me, and no one.   For the first time in months, I felt my spirits rise.  I was going to find my love.  I found the entrance to the Desert of Ro and began my trek across.  I passed by several camps of  Orcs, but wasn't seen.  I was rather proud of myself that I, a big bungling ogre, could slip by them unseen and unheard.  I found out later, they're not even as intelligent as us ogres.  By the time I had made it to the Oasis, I had been chased by the mumbling men who call the desert home, they had burned me and punched me as I ran for shelter.   Running was something new to me.  It was very hard to run from them when my blood boiled for battle, even knowing that they'd kill me almost immediately if not sooner... and my soul sang for my t'Ceira.  I had to find her.
<br><br>
      Once I reached the Oasis, I stopped to catch my breath.  While sitting in the burning white sand I noticed the sand shift and tremble, looking up I saw these huge feet.  On up I looked and looked and looked, jumping up I took a step back hoping that this incredibly huge creature didn't come after me.  The giant just stood there looking back and forth taking stock of the situation. I felt sweat pop out all over my skin.  I griped my rusted chopping ax until my hands burned, and for the first time in my life I felt small... wishing I were even smaller.  Finally, he moved off.   I let out a long sigh thinking, he could have eaten me whole, I never want to tangle with one of those things!   I waited awhile to see if he was really gone then I headed out.  Running on the beach I saw many other people there hunting this or that, and one of the hunters was a shaman from my home.  I approached him and asked for some help, I was hurt and needed to get directions.  He said, "Hello, little brudder, you look like you have been bedder. Let me see if me can do anything here."  His hands began to glow, then he looked at me and I felt the wolf come into me.  He cast again and all of my burns and bruises disappeared.  I hugged him and told him that I was forever in his debt.  "Becareful, brudder, their kind don't like us much in Freeport anymore, and Neriak is next to the Eastern Common area and guarded by humans. Maybe if you lucky, you can find this Diane hummie and she can help, but me wouldn't trust her, she a hummie and they are not gud to us.  Good luck, but I would suggest that you give up on this dark elf and go home."  Smiling he patted me on the shoulders and pointed in the direction that I needed to go.  His last words to me were to watch out for Lockjaw and stay away from the humans.
<br><br>
	I began to run along the beach, following the directions he had given me.  If I could just find that cave tunnel that He told me about, I wouldn't even have to go close to Freeport.  The cooler, wetter air felt good to my parched skin.  The burns and bruises still hurt a bit and I was thirstier than I had ever been before.  But, still I felt the song in my soul calling for t'Ceira, my little elfie.  I crept up to a fishing village that night.  This place I knew, I had been here before.  I was run by some Barbarians and they didn't like me much.  But, they pretty much left me alone while I rested.  I felt as if I was on my way to a great adventure.  I felt that she was close.  I could almost feel her hands caressing my face, and almost see the smile in her eyes.  I heard... well, more like felt... her musical voice in my mind... a whispery "Darvinn!  I love you!"  My resting was over!  I <b><em>KNEW</em></b> she was running to me as I was running to her.  I threw my provisions back in my pack and gathered my things up as fast as I could.  Yelling at the top of my voice as I ran... "TCEIRA!  WHERE ARE YOU!? TCEIRA!  I love you!"  The shifting sand caught at my feet, but I had my bearings now.  I could feel the tugging of where she was... and I knew she was searching for me as well.  I found the entrance to the cave tunnel easily and began running through the dark twisty turns yelling for her... "TCEIRA!  TCEIRA!"  I flew past the swashbucklers in a huge room, I'm sure they wondered why this big Ogre was running through yelling for someone named t'Ceira, but I paid them no mind.  I could see the light at the end of the tunnel.
<br><br>
	"DARVINN!  I love you!  Darvinn!  Where are you?"  I could hear her agony rip through the air.  But, my heart and soul sang with joy!  "TCEIRA!  I am here, beloved!"  I bellowed.  "Darvinn!?"  It was almost a question.  There she was!  I could see her dark form pelting down the tunnel to me!  "t'Ceira!  I love you! I love you!"  I cried!  I felt my heart leap with joy at the sight of her... more than that, she answered my love with her voice and her eyes... "Darvinn!  I love you too!"  
<br><br>
	I opened my arms wide as she got closer only wanting to hold her, to wrap my arms around her dainty form and protect her.  To feel her snuggling up next to me again.  I had my little elfie back!  And that note?  Well, it must have been a lie from Hargor.  But, I had my little elfie back!   My happiness knew no bounds!  She jumped up and I prepared to catch her.  I saw joy in her eyes to match my own.  Then she passed right through me and landed with a resounding thump behind me.  My blood went cold.  I turned very slowly to see her getting up, a horrified look on her face.  She walked very calmly over to me... her lavender eyes looking up at me filled with pain and love and... and something else... something dark.  She took a deep breath and walked through me again.  All I even felt was a slight passage of air.  "So, Hargor has kept his promise, my love.  He promised to take you from me.  That we could never be together again."   What?  Now, we are truly separated.  We have vowed to call for each other, to taunt Hargor with our last breath.  HE will never have t'Ceira, and HE will be constantly reminded of his evil, his cruelty... by knowing that t'Ceira and I love!
