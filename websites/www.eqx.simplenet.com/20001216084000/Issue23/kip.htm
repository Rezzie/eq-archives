The bartender gave Kip a knowing glance as the argument turned for the worse, drawing
the attention of the few remaining patrons to the table in the back corner. The
group of adventurers had settled in for a fair game of kings court with the halfling,
and not even twenty minutes into the night there were harsh words in the tavern. The
group seemed to be composed mostly of mercenaries and thugs, with the complimentary
apothecary of Bristlebane to offset the dull collection of warriors.

Kip Goodleaf was a regular at this odd tavern, The Broken Wheel it was called, and
was quite pleasantly in the middle of nowhere. There were hardly any regular patrons
at the tavern with the exception of traders who frequent the long road between
cities. The bartender was a quiet man who liked his silence, and was known for the
relaxing atmosphere in the bar. The only other person that could be counted on to be
found in the tavern was the half elf groundskeeper, Corwin.

As the other customers in the bar started to leave, fearing a fight at that table in
the back, voices were raised to try and resolve the misunderstanding, lest they be
kicked out of the bar. The apothecary was the voice of reason amongst the group,
being a man of faith and good humor. The others of the group seemed ready for blood.
One in particular, a warrior who was not at all ashamed that he was not good at
gambling because he was much stronger than anyone else at the table, and was verbally
making sure that everyone knew what copper was his.
