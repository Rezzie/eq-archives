After our weekly meeting Absor sent me the list of Expression suggestions from the readers.  It was suppose to be Oghma's turn, but he has been ill the last few days.  So we are cutting him some slack, and giving him a well-deserved break.  
<br><br>
After reading the list I have something to say.  
<br><br>
You reader's are the <b>greatest!</b>
<br><br>
This list has gotten huge!  I was reading through the inventory of suggestions and I could not believe how many of them there are.  
<br><br>
<em>So now I have to pick one.   I'll be right back.</em>
<br><br>
(<em>Time Passes</em>)
<br><br>
(<em>Laugh</em>) Ok I found this one.  I just love my readers.

<br><br>
Well Hayden, my family does all kinds of insanity I can could write about, but I try to keep it somewhat computer gaming related.   Oh wait…

Last night my sixteen yr. old son brought his new girlfriend to the house.  <em>It's his first real girlfriend-take-home-to-meet-parents</em>.
<br><br>
While sitting on the couch watching a movie we made sure she felt right at home by telling her about his flatulence problems.  My wife showed her pictures of him naked in the bathtub at age two.  We had a great time embarrassing the hell out of him, and I'm sure his new girlfriend thinks we are crazy!

Hand to hand combat - The fighter should have no problem decapitating the wizard!

If the fighter is any distance from the Wiz, the fighter should get smoked.  <em>Shessh-ka-bobbed</em>!

Ah!  I found one.  This is one of my favorite subjects..

<em>I would like to see an article covering the possible trade and commerce side of Norrath. With certain races having their own geographic hearts it seems to me that there must be some kind of transport infrastructure for the movement of goods to and from other cultures. Should provide for some rich hauls if one felt so inclined as to risk raiding a merchant caravan or flotilla.</em>
<br><br>
I'm sure there could be quests that might include an ambush of a caravan.   But I don't see many player parties getting ambushed by other players.  <em>Not from what I have read about the PK Switch feature</em>.  But It sounds like it will be tough as hell getting back to a city with your goods you want to sell.  From the information I have read on the boards like EQVault, it looks like travel between civilizations is going to be a nightmare!
<br><br>
So with this in mind, distance traveled to get the item could play a HUGE role in how much an item is worth in the game, and not just how rare the item is to find.

Ok here's one, Flip wrote:
<br><br>
<em>"Age vs Maturity in online worlds."    A look at how under 18 players are not always "KoOlDoOd" pkers.  There is a big difference between being young and being immature.</em>
<br><br>
I agree.  I have played RPG's with some pretty damn smart-ass eighteen-year-olds (just kidding).  
<br><br>
Actually an old D&D group of mine had three players under the age of eighteen.   Let me tell you, two of them acted more mature than I do, and we had one twenty eight-year-old guy that acted like a ten-year-old!
<br><br>
Age has nothing to do with acting immature.  
<br><br>
<em>Ok I'll be right back.  Looking for another one.</em>.
<br><br>
Ok this is the last one.
<br><br>
Some guy named Razor sent this one:
<br><br>
<em>Will there be sex in EverQuest?</em>
<br><br>
I like the way this guy thinks!
