The rain fell in arrow straight curtains, caught in suspension by the
lanterns light, a dreamy, mystical sight, or so it had always seemed to
Fale. Pulling his red woolen scarf over his mouth and nose, sparing only
the briefest of glances at the buildings that towered over the narrow,
cobbled streets of Freeport. Weather aside, Fale had always found this
particular city to be a remarkably ugly one. Though its shadowy alleys
and darkened niches always made for good business in his particular
craft, he was always stricken by the uniform boredom with which
everything seemed to be constructed. The timber and plaster homes all
seemed cut from the same cloth, patterned upon one another, mirror image
after mirror image along the rain slicked cobbles of the streets.
Elaborately craved wooden frames around the windows did little to take
away from this image, as the floral carvings all seemed to have been
designed by the same substandard artisan. Most of all, Fale was
disappointed with the inability of the citizens of this particular
seaport to recognize their own substandard lives. It was as if they
enjoyed living in tiresome, uninteresting mediocrity.
<br><br>
"Innoruk take them all…", he muttered, running bony fingers through his
spidery, dirty blond locks. They hung limply in front of his face, down
the back of his neck, and over his ears. Normally, he would have kept
his hair tied back with a length of black cord, but some individuals in
Freeport knew that particular look. The eyepatch that went with that
particular persona was something else which  he had discarded on this
particular visit. One or the other could give him away to the wrong
person, a possibility he really didn't feel the need to invite.
<br><br>
Not for the first time, he found himself questioning his arrival in the
city. Patrician had a way of always making Fale do exactly what he
didn't want to, and it was usually made far worse by the fact that Fale
almost always made a profit as a result. It was hard to turn down
results like that, no matter how distasteful.
<br><br>
Tripping over a cobble, a display which would have sent legions of
thieves across Norrath into gales of helpless laughter, the young thief
once again found himself wishing the vilest of fates upon the
inhabitants of this washed out little seaport.
<br><br>
"Whatever it is this time, Patrician, it better be worth three times
what the last job was, with half the blood…"
<br><br>
<hr><p style="text-align: justify">
Rain pattered against the windows of the Red Boar, their staccato
rhythm emphasizing the emptiness of the common room. A few drunken
patrons were slumped over the oak tables, or beneath them, their low
rumbling snores drifting throughout the room, interrupted only when the
barmaid was forced to push one of them aside in order to clean up a
particularly noxious mess. This late in the evening, the Red Boar was
little more than a flop house for those sailors who had neglected to
make arrangements for the evening, and had wandered in to complete their
evening in quiet inebriation.
<br><br>
The small group of men in the far corner of the tavern paid little
attention to the rain, the sailors, or the barmaids. Even Lamarus, the
barkeep, was beyond their notice…they had paid for their room and board
well in advance, and were interested in little else except the privacy
offered by the booth in which they sat.
<br><br>
"I thought you said he could be relied upon Patrician…"
<br><br>
Sweat soaked the fat man's forehead as scratched at his pockmarked
jowls, glancing about nervously as he spoke. The rings on his pudgy
fingers glittered with the promise of solid gold in the dim lantern
light of the room, the food stained clothes which he wore marked him as
a man of no small amount of wealth. That, more than anything else, made
him stand out in dockside tavern.
<br><br>
"He will be here Hagan, on that I would stake my life and reputation."
<br><br>
Calm, soothing, the words were as reassuring as the appearance of the
man who spoke them. His face was unremarkable, perhaps even a little
handsome, and his long black hair was swept back over his shoulders. His
hands were folded on the table in front of him, and he leaned over
towards Hagan with practiced nonchalance.
<br><br>
"Though I would advise against placing a wager against me", his slate
grey eyes turned suddenly cold, "I never lose". As he sat back in his
chair again, Patrician's eyes seemed almost to twinkle as he smiled, as
disarming a look as one would ever encounter. The Erudite was well known
for his grace, charm and manners, thought the mysterious powers at his
disposal made him somewhat of a mystery as well. Merchants knew him from
Freeport all the way down to the Oasis of Marr, and yet in some vaguely
disturbing way, none of them could ever recall when it was they had
actually met the man. He was a fixture in their lives, someone who had
always just been there, showing up every so often to share a drink, swap
a story or two, or perhaps even undertake a job. He was famous for
getting things done, when they needed doing, and dealt in the currency
of knowledge…as often as not, he would accept some small artifact or
rare book in lieu of coin.
<br><br>
His companions, however, were of a far more practical nature, if less
well known. Hagan was unfamiliar with the elf that sat across from
Patrician, though unlike most of his brethren, he seemed a dour and
unfriendly sort. Thick brown hair fell in waves onto his shoulders,
framing a thin, angular face that might be considered handsome were it
not locked in a perpetual sneer. He had spoken only twice during the
evening: Once, to order a pitcher of fine red wine for himself, a
pitcher which was now nearly empty, and the second time to ask just how
much Hagan was willing to pay for this particular job.
Next to Patrician sat a barrel of a dwarf, little more than a collection
of corded muscles and bristling, fiery red hair he seemed. Beady black
eyes peered out from beneath a set of bushy eyebrows which met directly
above a narrow axe head of a nose. When he spoke, the words tumbled
forth in a rapid fire stream of heavily accented, barely comprehensible
shouts. And so long as the topic centered around gold, or the
acquisition thereof, he always had plenty to say. Now, as they sat
waiting for Patrician's third companion, the Dwarf was leering at one of
the barmaids, elbowing Patrician in the ribs as she leaned over one of
the tables to remove an overturned mug.
<br><br>
"Honh, me boyo, be takin' a look at that there, neh? Bes' be takin' a
look afore we be headin' out ta sea, be a long time comin' afore we see
such a sight agin…"
<br><br>
"Perhaps another time, Cutter. I believe Hagan brought us here for
reasons other than the pleasures of the flesh."
<br><br>
The dwarf snorted, continuing his inspection of the barmaid as
Patrician turned back towards Hagan.
<br><br>
"And I am assuming that once Fale arrives, you will be a little more
forthcoming on why you have engaged my particular services for what
seems little more than a salvage operation? I assure you, the
authorities here in Freeport are far more adept at handling the recovery
of sunken vessels and their cargo than I, or any of my compatriots."
<br><br>
Hagan pulled an embroidered silk handkerchief from the pocket on the
front of his richly decorated great coat, mopping at his brow as once
again cast a nervous glance at the door.
<br><br>
"Perhaps, though as you are well aware, I'm certain, the Freeport
authorities have a rather bad habit of keeping most of what they salvage
as 'payment' for their services…assuming they ever report finding what
you sent them out looking for. The cargo which I lost is far too
valuable to risk leaving to the…authorities."
<br><br>
Patrician hid his smile behind the mug of cider which he raised to his
lips. Hagan was a poor merchant, and an even worse liar. Briefly,
Patrician entertained the thought of laying the bloated whale's corpse
out on a table for a vivisection, but set the thought aside. Clearly,
the cargo aboard the vessel was something which would greatly disturb
the authorities should it be uncovered. Narcotics and most smuggled
goods would have already been spoiled by submersion, and Patrician did
not think Hagan the kind of man to spend the additional coin to protect
his goods against such spoilage with magicks. Slaves might raise the ire
of the local authorities, but in death, one bloated corpse is much like
another, and telling crew and cargo apart after two weeks beneath the
waves would be impossible.
<br><br>
Clearly, it had to be something far more disturbing. Magic, more likely
than not, but from the looks which Hagan had been tossing about all
evening, dark magicks. Though he did not allow it to register upon his
features, he was delighted at the thought.
