<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 17!</font></p>
<p align="justify">
I never thought I would ever have this problem.  Maybe I am naïve.  Maybe I expect
too much out of people, especially people that I have never met.  I guess I have
always assumed integrity in those that I meet for the first time, and those that I
have never met.
<br><br>
Or maybe people just don't know.  There is a lot of material being shared in the
Everquest community, and it gives the appearance that anything is allowed.
<br><br>
So I have to remind everyone that all material presented here in EverQuest Express
is solely the property of those that created it.  The articles and tales are owned
by the authors and are used here with their permission.  That should be pretty
obvious.  But I have recently learned that it is not so obvious to everyone.  So I
have been forced to add a disclaimer on our front page, and I have been inspired to
rant about it here.
<br><br>
Here are some basic internet copyright rules.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The creator of the material owns it, and may license it to another.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(This is what happens when people write for eqx.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The mere fact of creation is enough to own the copyright.  If you
do register the copyright, you can sue for damages if anyone uses it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The only way you can use something without asking is:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) if it is clearly stated that it is in the public domain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the copyright for it has clearly been abandoned (after many years,
usually)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Posting attribution does not absolve you of contacting the creator.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5. If you link to a site, netiquette suggests that you should notify the
webmaster of that site.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, material includes text, graphics, and html effects.
<br><br>
Obviously I am writing this because someone "borrowed" some material from this site.
I am happy to say that the issue was resolved peacefully enough.  But it left a
somewhat unpleasant feeling with me, and I am not sure exactly what to do about it.
I guess I’ll just wait for it to pass.
<br><br>
I can keep my mind occupied with the fact that the last day for Sony to accept
applications for the first phase of the beta has passed.  I can only hope that…
uh, "soon" we will hear that people are actually testing the game.
<br><br>
Thanks for reading.
