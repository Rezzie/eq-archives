I have an opinion of what I look for in a game.  Keep in mind taste in games could
differ from yours.  
<br><br>
<b>Plot / Story</b>
<br><br>
I like a good plot.  I don’t like to run around mindlessly through a virtual world
with no purpose.  I like to pickup clues as to why I’m there as I play along.    I
also tend to enjoy either being in the future on sometime during the days of King
Arthur.  I like a story that just keeps getting better and better the longer you
play.  My god, when I was descending into the depths of Diablo my stomach was in
knots.  I feared death at every corner of darkness I uncovered.

<b>Items</b>
<br><br>
I like tons and tons of items.  "Named" items.  Remember that Sword of Ancient you
found.  The one you would kill yourself if you ever lost it.   That sword you had to
fight fifteen hours in a dungeon, almost loosing your life, to get?

<b>Creatures with Superior AI</b>
<br><br>
It needs to have creatures that have uniqueness from each other.  A Creature that can
follow you around corners, up stairs and other obstacles.  I hate when a creature
gets stuck behind a wall allowing you to shoot it without effort.   And for God
sakes, I hate when you’re aggressed by fifty thousand enemies in one room.  Come
on.   How about one or two creatures in one room that are hard as hell to defeat,
and chase your ass all over the level, possibly leading you into more creatures.
