Aklar's story is truly amazing. The plot depth and development of the
characters is unbelievable, rivaling even those of professional authors.
I eagerly look forward to each installment of this story and I hope he
may write other stories when this one is at it's end.

To whom it may concern,
<br><br>
"But it will never mesh with the incidents that others have had in that
same place, nor will it change Norrath. And that's a plain shame."
<br><br>
I would really like to concur.  Recently I asked a question in the Q&A
forum as to whether or not the Vile Freeport militia will ever be
drummed out of Freeport once and for all.  The answer?  Nope.  Probably
never, its "just part of the game."
<br><br>
It would be great to think that Verant could have teams of people to
help make Norath a living breathing world where our actions ammount to
more then just pebbles tossed into a grand ocean only to make ripples
for a few feet before dissappearing.  Wouldn't it be quite a story to
see the Paladins of Marr actually retake Freeport?  I doubt I could ever
take part in such a battle, if it took place (I have chronic MCS)  but
to say "I lived in Freeport, back before the rebellion".  It would give
us something to role play about.  Surely another type of conflict could
evolve from Freeport becoming a holy city.  This would allow even more
RPing as ppl struggle to figure out just who's side they're on.
<br><br>
What makes the an RPG a GREAT RPG is the story that evolves around your
characters.  The one you shape, the one you watch, and the one you talk
about for days, months and years after the fact.  I still get together
with my High School buddies and talk about some of the stories from our
old days of playing Shadow Run, where Man! did we get into trouble.  But
when I talk abou EQ with my friends, its rarely about how we saved
someone, or really made a difference that people could notice.  We end
up talking about spells that we just got, camps we busted wide open, or
battles we barely one with the same monsters everyone else fights every
minute of the day.
<br><br>
Maybe someday I'll figure out how to make my little difference.....

He ya'll,
<br><br>
Just wanted to say 'right on' to Ohgma's editorial in <a href="../Issue83/edito.htm">edition #83</a>.  I have
been reading the newspaper for a month or so now and have been following
Ohgma's 'gaming depression' over the last few editions.  I am a strong
proponent for when games like this lose their entertainment value and become
a 'second' career it's time to quit.  I saw Oghma heading this way and was
hoping you would not quit.  ( I would hate to lose Oghma's wit,criticism,and
spin on the issues.)  Glad you got back to the basics.  I often spend a
whole night just buffing and healing people.  Often running from zone end to
end to cast a critical heal poison or disease.  You meet all sorts of
people. Some mean, some immature, most good, most willing to role play
through a few minutes of dialogue with me, and a select few that become
EQ-comrades.  I have found that if I do this every week or so I establish a
strong network of "entertainment" for every time I log in.  It may sound
goofy but as I grew this network of contacts my ability to level quicker
actually increased.  I think the increase in leveling is due to knowing more
people that 'role-play/play' together better.  You get plugged in with a
more robust, considerate, fun group of people as your network grows.  All I
can say is keep it up Ohgma.  Whatever has kept you with it this long I hope
is still available to you in-game.  I would hate to lose you from the
editorial staff.

Response to <a href="../Issue84/edita.htm">Absor's Editorial</a>
<br><br>
Err... I'm not really clear if I'm sending this to the right place, but hopefully it will eventually reach Absor. Hey, I'm just a dumb troll, you'll have to excuse me. =)
 <br><br>
 
Well, first of all, congrats on the trip to Vegas. I guess by "succesful" you mean that you made out like a hog at the craps table, but I have mixed feelings about this. I'm happy you won, but I live in Vegas, and gambling taxes pay for our schools, etc. so... I'm sorry you won... =)
 
 <br><br>
Anyway, towards the end of your article you suggested that Norrath was an unsatisfying setting because it is both unchanging and repetitive. It kinda makes me think of Gilligan's Island. Sure, some stuff happens, Mary Ann flirts with Gilligan, the Professor hatches a plan, but then they're still stuck on that freakin island!
 <br><br>
Sorry enough of that... The point is this kind of media, including EverQuest, is mostly "static." Until the expansion comes out, or a made for TV movie or something. And then everything's static again. My question is this: how do you feel players would respond to an entirely dynamic environment? What if the gnolls could be driven out of Qeynos hills? What if the dark races could take Freeport and make it their own? What if Lady Vox stayed dead?
 <br><br>
Well, the first problem that comes up is that in the case of a MMORPG, the setting can't be changed without significantly changing the system. I love your emphasis on tone, but that's art, that's the hearts and souls of the designers pouring into their work. Anyway, making the leap to a dynamic world is just plain weird. Traditionally the focus is on the character -- that's the piece of the world that is dynamic and is under player control. So in EQ, people level and pursue equipment. That's the dynamic element, and in that sense EQ is naturally for what people call powergamers.
 <br><br>
To me EQ feels like the old days of AD&D when my group didn't really have a world. We went to a dungeon, killed things, the went back to "the town" and sold some of the loot and bought new equipment. The world of EQ is not only static, it's dumb. Killing lots of orcs in Ro never triggers any sort of retaliation. There is no orc empire (well, Crushbone) that will form any sort of retaliation. The gnolls outside of Blackburrow never run inside and warn the others, or assemble defenses to deal with the players camping outside.
 <br><br>
Dynamic and dumb wouldn't be a pretty site -- the gnolls would be run out of Qeynos hills. That's it. No more gnolls. So dynamic and smart... The web of relations in the World of Darkness is a good place to start. Lemme quote you, I like this line... =)<br>
"And for every little push or pull on the fabric of the world that your character attempts, there is a framework of webbing and spiders there to pull back."
 <br><br>
So dynamic and smart... say the gnolls get attacked in Blackburrow, but not exterminated. In the spirit of the web idea, they call upon they're allies... wait gnolls don't really have allies... so maybe what's left of them pledge their eternal souls to Innoruuk gaining power, and allies. So next time Blackburrow is invaded the players run up against undead gnolls, shadowknights, and liches... Maybe they're still driven out -- then I'd call upon some talented players to take up the role of the handful of survivors, and let them quest for allies, an artifact, or even become assasins just out for revenge, disguising themselves and hiding out in the slums of Qeynos, stalking the heroes that took their homes...
 <br><br>
Of course, the smartest, most dynamic world would just give a lot of control to players, and let them deal with the mess. Eliminate the idea of "dungeons." Let players be orcs, gnolls, and frogloks; and let those powerful necromancers inhabit a dungeon, raising an undead army and hatching Evil plans.
 <br><br>
The problem with this is that it is chaos. And that's what I'm wondering about... a dynamic and smart world is ideal, but designers and programmers might be a way off from being able to do this. A world made up entirely of players and which leaves the entire makeup and future in the hands of the players, though, is an easier task, but for the life of me I can't figure out if people would actually like it. It's the difference between "highly structured" -- EQ -- and, well, chaos. "Loosely structured" if you want to be nice about it. If you ever played UO, it was more loose than EQ, and has a few good examples. Players had the ability to place houses and buildings, and despite the downside of "urban sprawl," there arose a player community that organized a succesful player-run town.
 <br><br>
Well, I'll just end it there...<br>
Oh yeah, my disclaimers:<br>
I'm just sorta dreaming and tossing around ideas,<br>
AND I am just a stupid troll anyway =)
 <br><br>
Hey, and next time ya get kinda sick of EQ, try what I do... write down everything bad about the game and then dream up ways to do it better. Then just accept it for what it is, simply the best in it's genre (currently), and have fun with it now. The very idea of massively multiplayer online games is still in its infancy, and while it may be the future of entertainment, there have to be mistakes for there to be learning. I think you are doing a great service by rantin -- I mean, uh, educating people about how this world could be better. =)
 <br><br>
Take care,
 <br><br>

     The history I am most interested in is why the races at war on the race 
war server.  I can see why the evil races are killing everybody. They want 
to rebuild their empire.  But why are all these gnomes picking on us elves?  
What did we ever do to them?  It must have been something bad...  Oh well, 
I'll just pick up my sword and mindlessly slaughter all the short people in 
sight for no apparent reason.  See where I'm headed?<br><br>
    Anyway, If the players are supposed to make history, then let's do it!  
Do you think EQX could ask other people for their tales about the history of 
the race war?  Perhaps hold a contest for the "official" history?  I'd just 
like to know what we are fighting for.

<em>[Ed. - I certainly agree.  With the odd configuration required to make the race war 
server work.  I mean, why are the Halflings so interested in killing Barbarians?  And, maybe 
more importantly, why is it that they can kill them without warning, yet they can't attack 
Dwarves?  I would love to see Verant hold a contest for history submissions...]</em>
