 More importantly, in order to participate in guild wars, in-character
  killings (those that are roleplayed, and not just mindless slaughters),
  and other truly fun aspects of the game, your PK switch will have to be
  ON.  I'm sure a majority of people will turn this ON eventually.  Obviously
  this leaves you open to the game-destroying mindless slaughters and corpse
  looting by sticky-fingered gnomes.

<b><em>o User Cap</em></b>
<br><br>
  By limiting the number of people allowed per server, Sony is requiring 
  that they foot the bill for more servers every time more people sign up
  for the game.  This is going to limit their cash flow, which may detract
  from putting the money towards game development.  And actually, any hit to 
  profitability is generally difficult to push through the various layers of 
  management, so the user cap may not even happen.  It is highly unusual for
  a company to put quality of gameplay over sheer dollars.  We have already 
  seen the definition of the user cap change, and currently there is no limit 
  to the number of players allowed online at any given time.  During peak 
  hours, we may very well see the same server lag problems as in every other 
  game.

<b><em>o Variety</em></b>
<br><br>
  Whenever you have many different types of equipment, monsters, spells,
  and skills, along with the promise of continually adding more upon more,
  you run into the impossible task of maintaining balance.  This has been 
  one of the biggest challenges in running an ever-expanding MUD.  What
  typically happens is people realize what armor or weapon is the best,
  and all start using it.  Then, in order to increase variety again, the
  items are tweaked.  Either that or other things become more powerful, resulting
  in a proliferation of numbers that radically offsets any balance achieved
  in the past, or anything that is deemed the "best" gets downgraded.  This 
  applies to races, classes, skills, and spells, too.  Imagine picking your 
  race and class, only to have it downgraded a month later, when you no longer 
  have a choice.  Sure, the game may start out without any problems like this, 
  but maintaining a balance while adding new things is another story.
