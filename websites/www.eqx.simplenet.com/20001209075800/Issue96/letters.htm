You mentioned you created a new character and withing lvl 5 were given 4
pieces of bronze and buffed unasked. What server was this? I am getting
really sick of selfish people and the camping and screwing that goes on.
I play on Fennin Ro, and I've just about given up.

<em>I play on Karana.  Sorry for the long wait for a reply, but I wanted to
think about what I wrote back to you.  Sometimes it's more about how you
act or roleplay than anything else.  I was playing a funny character and
wasn't asking for anything or doing anything in a begging fashion. Attitude
is probably most of it.  I ran across someone who ws emptying their bank
account of "junk" - misc bronze and stuff. I bought a few (for 5pp each!)
and was given the rest.
<br><br>
Mostly don't let the jerks get you down.  I find that I have a better time
if I leave monsters as soon as they are camped, and don't get involved in
interactions with bad players. You'll find if you have fun, Role-play a
little, and don't sweat the small stuff it goes ok. Seek out good players
and play with them.
<br><br>
Good luck! <br>

Teirlap Carooe's "A Biblical Note" was very funny in the 95th issue of EQX. However, he did not have a specific email address to send comments to. Please pass on my praise to him.
 <br><br>
Keep up the great work guys (and gals of course!).

Maybe I was just drunk on some bad elven wine or something, but this weeks "Fit to Print" did not make sense to me. Am I missing something? Maybe this is one of those "Faydwer races only" inside jokes. Hmm...

I agree with Oghma that Norrath needs more religious festivals. I've been
trying to get April 15th accepted as the Feast Day of Innoruuk for months
now.
<br><br>
It would also be nice to have a Norrath time server, where your client could
send a query and find out the day & time in game while you're off-line.
