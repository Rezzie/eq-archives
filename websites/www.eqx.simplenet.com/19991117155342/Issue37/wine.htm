I've been noticing different posts on the vault concerning character race and how that affects a character's ability to enter some towns.  I've pondered cultural context and its part in role-playing for some time now. 
<br><br>
Cultural context is a much more dynamic tool for role-playing then it may appear on the surface.  Asking for cultural context to be applied to EQ is not an argument for realism.  To a degree, it is a tool for us to immerse ourselves in a different world with its own civilization. Culture is a by-product of evolution and development of civilizations. Even Neanderthals exhibited rudimentary culture. (They buried their dead facing the same direction and the males usually with personal possessions).    All civilizations and certainly civilizations of the same race share similar beliefs and attitudes, which is explained through learning theories, specifically Social Learning Theory when dealing with culture. All cultures are biased, which means none of them are right or wrong.  Aztecs considered human sacrifice a sacred part of their religion. I doubt there are many cultures or subcultures in the USA that would condone this today. Does that make the Aztecs wrong?  Does it make Americans right?  No and no. 
<br><br>
What does that paragraph about culture have to do with the game? Isn't that what this is. . . a game? Precisely, it's an RPG.  And I want to role-play culture, which can be very hard if drows are walking hand-in-hand with paladins drinking ale.  
<br><br>
You say, "well you are choosing to role-play the drow or shadow knight that way, so you have to deal with it."  But I say some races are going to be born and raised to share beliefs and attitudes. They should have similar alignments and similar views concerning other races.. They may choose the company of different races if it benefits them, but generally, drow despise not just other elves but everyone according to Norrath history.  A drow should be able to spend most of his young life around his homeland and see very few other races. High elves, woodland elves, ogres, trolls, and maybe even erudites, halflings, dwarfs, gnomes, and barbarians might also have their own areas or homelands where outsiders are not welcome.  Obviously, humans and half-elves vary in their culture.
<br><br>
Of course, there is always going to be a renegade drow or what not evil race who finds company in good aligned races.  Maybe you are a drow who does not believe the same as other drow even with similar upbringing. Maybe your were stolen as a child and sold or raised in another town.  Maybe you feel a debt of gratitude because your life was saved or spared by a woodland elf, not likely for a drow.  But I don't mind those being role-played at all.  I would just like the environment or culture to force you to traverse your butt across Norrath in search of neutral ground.   Because if I'm a drow, and you enter my homeland as a high elf, I would have so much hatred and disdain for you that my sole purpose would be to remove you from the face of the world for having the nerve to come here.  There wouldn't be many races for which I didn't feel that disdain.  If I were a woodland elf, I would have so much shame or fear for your presence in my homeland that I would want to at least arrest you and have you escorted to the border.   More drastically, I would have you removed permanently. 
<br><br>
The current MUD I play is to me a very good text based ORPG.  The game mechanics are very dynamic, and you have a lot of flexibility in developing a character.  But it does lack different cultures, which limits its role-play ability.  I think there are several reasons. 1) It's text based. We are such visual creatures.  If I don't see a drow walk into a tavern, then a drow didn't walk in until I type look [name]. 2) There exist a global culture shared by the majority.  Everyone seems to get along.  It's us intelligent races against the monsters.  3)  You can role-play anything you want. But if you are role-playing a drow who hates humans or such, you will not find very many other dark elves who share your views. They will just wonder why you are so nasty. Thus, this is not culturally driven behavior that is reinforced by your environment and shared by others. It becomes a reflection of <em>one</em> single drow's beliefs, and simply a self-alienating behavior, making you an outcast.  
<br><br>
To me, it would be a nice and rich cultural environment for role-playing (one that would reinforce it) if some races had an area (rather small in the scope of things) that was solely theirs with its own town.  Any other race entering would become pvp+.  If they happen to make it to the town in the area, the guards will start looking for them if alerted.   Then there could be aligned  towns and neutral towns as well.  Some races could be restricted to certain alignments while others could choose over the entire spectrum of alignments.  All characters could enter neutral towns without fear.  Obviously, aligned characters should not feel safe entering opposing aligned towns. It may be that neutral aligned characters can enter all towns that do not fall within a race's homeland, but they may get switched to pvp+ when entering good or evil aligned town. (shrug)   I think you get my idea. Obviously, all the above would take a lot of resources. But I hope you can imagine some role-playing aspects that could arise from cultural diversity among races.  Sure, you're free to take your evil-tinged hearted paladin and go hunt with a shadow knight, but don't bring him in our town, cause we don't approve and weren't raised that way.  And I'm not too sure his home town would give you a warm welcome either.  So go find some city where they take all forms of people. 
<br><br>
I'm pleased that EQ is looking to restrict towns.  It should help add a tool for role-playing.  Hopefully it will help in scenarios like this.  
<br><br>
(Mike) is sitting in his favorite bar having a nice wine. He finishes it and orders another from the barmaid.  As she strides away, he notices a figure approaching him out of the corner of his eye.  
<br><br>
(Joe) looks over the figure sitting at the table. He thinks to himself, "You know I'd like to have him along next time I go kill things.  I can use him to patch me up. I died that last time, and I was about to level".
<br><br>
Mike watches the figure as he seats himself at the table.  Mike's eye's widen in disbelief. He asks, "What by the gods do you think you are doing?" 
<br><br>
Joe: "nothing buddy, just thought I'd sit and have a drink with you"
<br><br>
Mike: "I don't think so…quite the contrary" he begins to get up..
<br><br>
Joe: "hey where you going? Why you bein so rude jack?"
<br><br>
Mike: "You're drow or haven't you noticed?"
<br><br>
Darksoulkiller : "So!!  You gotta a problem with that?!"
<br><br>
Burnstride: "I think you are spoiling the taste of my wine."
<br><br>
Of course, Mike is Burnstride the Paladin who can't stand the smell of drow, and refuses their company at any time. And although Joe's character may be drow, he is still Joe.
