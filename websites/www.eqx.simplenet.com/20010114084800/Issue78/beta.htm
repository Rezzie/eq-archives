<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the more annoying trends that has developed over the past several years in PC gaming is the tendency for companies to release products that are, quite simply, not finished.  Generally the consensus logic behind this seems to be that problems can just be patched in the future.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes it’s done by accident … a broken quest in a game, not enough QA (&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;), etc.  And sometimes it’s simply done to get a product to market, because development-level companies do have some pressure to get some revenue on the books (especially when it can take years to develop a single project).  In 20 years of PC gaming (and a stint working at a software store in college) I’ve seen both, with products running the gamut from small tweaks needed to obviously unfinished products hitting the shelves.  In fact, come to think of it, I can just barely remember the last game I bought that didn’t have at least one patch released subsequently.  I think it was pong for the Atari.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think as a gaming community we can excuse away the first reason … as games become increasingly complex in design, finding the bugs in a bujillion lines of code can’t be a 100% guaranteed.  So when someone has their character in a game put a spork in a box on a rainy Tuesday in March when the moon is waning and that single combination locks the game up, we can accept the fact that OK, someone missed this, but it’ll be patched.  Bummer, but life goes on as long as putting that spork in the box wasn’t integral to completing the game.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Spork!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><em>Had to say it again; for some reason that is the only word in the English lexicon that makes me giggle like a school-girl.  On a side note, you can have all of the smart bombs and stealth fighters you want, but give me a spork and some duct tape any day to prove the U.S.'s true technological superiority.</em></p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second reason is the more insidious one, and you’d be surprised how many companies are willing to do it.  The fact of the matter is that developing PC games is a risky business with enormous competition, low barriers to entry (hint, think &quot;Doom&quot;) and very little margin.  Only a handful of games ever sell enough to recoup costs, much less make a profit.  That’s one of the reason why companies like Electronic Arts have been in consolidation mode; as congested as the market is, having the economies of scale that a giant like EA has is almost necessary to be successful in the long-term.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Open beta tests have become popular in the last few years as all software, not just games, becomes so complicated that a single QA team cannot handle the job alone.  So we all risk the crashes, registry scrambles and other assorted beta nightmares to test a game for a company.  Sometimes we even get a nifty T-shirt.  Online community-based games like EQ need this more than most, because one of the things you test for during these betas are how the game handles the server-load and having 1,500 people run through the thing like monkeys on PCP.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So here’s the issue du jour … the more I play EQ and the more I read the various boards, the thought enters my mind that the last beta of EQ may have never ended.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gasp.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My God, Jerkius has blasphemed against the holy EQ that feeds our gaming needs and keeps us up way past our normal bed-times, bleery-eyed and chain-smoking, drooling and navigating the mouse by sheer force of will alone!!!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, before you wipe the Doritos cheedle off of your fingers to grab your torch and pitchfork, let’s think about this a bit.  From reading the boards, talking to a LOT of players and most of all, PLAYING the game, I’ve noticed a few things that started me thinking about this.  Keep in mind before you delve into this that I write with a poison pen and a black sense of humor, so if this offends you then good -- that means you are thinking about the issue.  Thinking GOOD.  And if you are going to send &quot;fan mail&quot; at least say something nice like &quot;well, at least that &amp;$@!’s used a neat font,&quot; otherwise I get it forwarded to me from Absor with this quizzical little <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
 that reminds me of my old news-desk editor’s comments when I’d totally accidentally misidentify a city-councilman as a crack-addicted, farm animal sodomizing drunkard with bad breath.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyways,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>PvP, at least on Rallos, is not implemented properly.  I started on this server, and it was a true awakening to both how great EQ is and simultaneously how blind I was going in.  Between the rules used, the game mechanics and the unbalanced nature of the classes, the experience left me wondering how in the hell this game ever left beta.  This is not just a matter of me not liking the way in which PvP was implemented here, either; quite simply I’m not sure why they bothered putting the melee classes as choices to play on there to begin with.  I have a sneaking suspicion it’s so people would kvetch enough about it that it would get yanked, fullfilling the masterplan of a no-PvP world.  OK I’m joking a bit there, but it really is badly done.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The upper level mobs, according to rumor, are not equipped.  I have not been able to confirm this, but I have seen complaining about it many times so we’ll toss it in here.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The trade system is a mess.  This one I have experienced first-hand, and believe me, it’s a doozy.  Unlike the board posters would have you believe, however, the problem here is NOT that the merchants will not buy finished goods at a higher price than the cost of component parts.  The problem is that the damned skills aren’t finished yet.  Tailoring and fishing are the most annoying examples, but it seems that quite a few of the other ones are not either (brewing, tinkering, alchemy, etc.).  Major boo and hiss on this one, because it’s blatantly short-sighted.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I’m spending extra time here on number three because it personally drives me nuts.  We all know Verant will add new dimensions to the trade skills, but the fact of the matter is that with one or two exceptions, most of them aren’t finished yet.  Don’t believe me?  Find a tinker or a tailor and ask them what they think of the skill.  Find a fisherperson (how PC!) and ask them what the fifth item you can pull out of the oceans is (hint:  there are only 4 implemented, that a month of research has turned up).  Ask a brewer to name more than 5 things they can brew.  Ask a smith how to make plate, or an alchemist how to, err, oh wait, you can’t do alchemy yet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And then ask a fletcher or a jewler about their skills, because of the entire list these two are the only ones that seem to have been given much thought (smithing and baking too, to be fair, I just don’t think are detailed enough yet).  OK, now that we got all that out, onto the next number …</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The spell system is not balanced properly.  Ever notice what the majority of patches are doing every week?</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The game mechanics, in certain areas, need some work still.  Not just NPC clipping, but also in the rules o’ the universe Verant sets up.  As indicated by Brad’s posts on the Usenet group for EverQuest, the programmers are still debating the merits of several issues such as fixing camping (hint: you can’t), death effects, looting, trade skills, transportation, etc.  Aren’t those debates best done in beta, as opposed to when you have 100,000 paying customers?</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>There seems to have been a sacrifice of ‘reality’ for game balance issues.  The most glaring of this to me is why in the Hell can you find ore in Steamfront but not in Kaladim, a city based IN A MINE and populated by dwarves, who traditionally are MINERS.  Or how about, WHY is there a tailor shop in Kaladim, when there isn’t a wolf for a hundred miles.  I hope that seamstress working the counter is moonlighting, or her children will be eating out of a dumpster behind the arena when her business folds.  I’ve been to ALL of the cities, but I chose Kaladim here as an example because I enjoy leveling near there … but you could make the same arguments for a lot of these cities and NPC loads.  </LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Look at the evil races … it’s about 10 times harder to skill up smithing (I have a master smith on one of the servers, so I do know whereof I speak on this) as an evil race as it is a good race.  The only argument I could find for this is that ogres and trolls wouldn’t be smart enough to smith, which brings me to my next point (we’ll make this sub-set A of number 6 here):</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) No one at Verant has ever met a blacksmith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><em>This is not a slam on blacksmith's intelligence, but let's be honest, they aren't teaching smithing at Harvard.  That being said smiths are wonderful people and I realize that without them our society would be a seething mass of chaos and destruction and really bad powertools, so don't bother sending that email you are about to type in.</em></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OK, Jerkius, but couldn’t you make that list up for a lot, if not all, of online gaming?  Yes I could, and as a former MUD admin I’d be the first to admit it, because here’s the rub … online games are more evolutionary in nature than a single-player game.  Because of the community aspects, the underlying themes and really, because of the massive amount of players involved, these games tend to evolve to what I call &quot;balance plateaus.&quot;  As the playerbase matures and becomes more educated in terms of game mechanics, load spots, where to powerlevel, what equipment/spell/skill combinations are more effective, you have to as an admin adjust the knobs slightly.  It’s actually a fairly fascinating thing to watch from on-high, because you can map out the distinct times when there’s almost a fundamental paradigm shift in the community.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And there’s nothing wrong with that, or a game administration altering the mix slightly as time passes (assuming they THINK first, which is the key ingredient of doing this with minimum backlash).  Again as said a few paragraphs prior it’s game expansion, and especially in RPG’s where there are ceilings you can hit (level 50, all the spells, master of every skill, etc.), that’s a good thing.  Expansion GOOD.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, you have to have a strong foundation to expand upon, and to be honest I’m not sure EQ has it.  [insert obligatory preface about how sweet EQ is here]  EverQuest is a brilliant game, with touches of genious in some places.  The artwork is phenomenal, the sound effects and music are great, and overall the experience is one blissful, find-a-puppy-and-hug-it immersive experience.  Let us all bow our heads and say a prayer of to Aradune and the gang.  But at the end of that prayer ask him to finish making the basic game, because this puppy is not finished and polished to the point where I would call it commercially ready (which draws us way back o’er hill and dale to the original point -- aren’t tangents great?).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Gods On High will add spells.  They will add new equipment.  They will add new things to trade-skill on (patterns, etc.).  They will add new zones, and new baddies to fill them.  Wonderful news.  But the fact of the matter is the basis of those additions is still under construction, and personally I’d rather see them base game fixed long before we get the expansion pack late this year/end of next year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is EQ playable in it’s current state?  Absolutely.  Is it fun as hell?  Absolutely.  Is it still in beta?  Absolutely.</P>
