The Welsh ‘bard" meant master poet, and apparently was an equal status/knowledge
level as the lower Irish "bard". With the advent of Christianity, the Welsh became a
rigidly structured caste of Court Poets, with strict rules on verse form and meter,
which so restricted creative expression that the form ossified and died out.

 It was the Irish bard who fulfilled the traditional roles of bearer of culture, even
 when the Roman and later the English governments hunted them down as spies.  Seekers
 of truth were dangerous to regimes bent on subjugating a conquered people and the
 fastest way to dominate a culture is to relieve them of those who disseminate the
 lore and law.

This is the bard I had in mind when I created the character concept of Oghma.  A
repository of dwarven culture, out to broaden his experience and at the same time
educate and entertain.  As a neutral in political disputes, he holds the respect of
both sides, and could use is knowledge of law and culture to arrive at the truth.
Whatever powers and abilities bards have in Everquest, this bard is possible to play,
due to the non-specificity of his abilities.
