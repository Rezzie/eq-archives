Is there a god of complication?  If there were, he would be my deity.  There are some days where he would do nothing but follow me around adding layer upon layer of complexity to my life until the absurdity of it all caused the rest of his brethren on the pantheon of cruelty (the gods of Spite, Nausea, Impotence, Tight-fitting-shorts) to burst into hysterics.
<br><br>
As there is not, well, then let's just say that I am the patron saint of complications.  I am its avatar.
<br><br>
Now you've got to be wondering what I am rambling about.  I am discussing "The case of the horn of summoning".
<br><br>
If you've never heard of a horn of summoning nor read about it in the library of Erudin there is a reason why not.  It doesn't exist!  But try and tell that to Mixsho.
<br><br>
He stumbled into my office like a halfling leaving a trollish brothel.  I'm not the type to stand on ceremony so I helped pour him into the nearest chair and then sat back behind my desk.  Normally I would escort a drunk from my office with a properly placed motion of my boot.  I have a special pair just for this task, with a thick bronze tip.  I thought about adding a targeting sight, but that would interfere with the aerodynamics of the kick as I sent these time-wasters sprawling across the docks outside my office.  In this case I let the little man sit because Mixsho is a big wheel in the local merchant community.
<br><br>
I've insulted a lot of people over the years, all of them rather carelessly, but here I knew to not harm the man who rented me the very office space in which we both sat.  So I put my feet up and watched is eyes spin as he leaned back in the chair and watched the ceiling spin until at last I could finally make out some of what he said.
<br><br>
"Monoomgoingto gathertis trezuransellit."
<br><br>
Okay, so it's not easily deciphered.  Fortunately I speak drunkanese.  Fluently.  In fact there are days where that's all I speak.  You would refer to these as "weekdays".
<br><br>
This was the 6th day, and as such I had remained sober long enough to pay my bills and become really irritated by the antics of the drunks who wandered the docks.  When you are out of money and drink, suddenly other drunks are jack-asses.
<br><br>
But let's get back to Mixsho's weird ramblings.  He actually said, roughly translated, "Man am I going to gather all this treasure and sell it."
<br><br>
"What treasure," I asked, as a means of simply entertaining myself.
<br><br>
"Younotgetmuhtrezr…. Amgonnaget lotzofmony," he slurred, (Meaning: You're not going to get my treasure, I'm going to get lots of money).
<br><br>
"Fine," I said and stood, deciding it was time to show him out, when he turned did exactly what I was trying to avoid by showing him the door.  He heaved all over the floor in front of my desk.  Gnomes sure can't handle their liquor.
<br><br>
Damage was done.  So I set him in the spare cot downstairs, mopped the floor, and went upstairs to sleep.
<br><br>
Next day, Mixsho is standing at the foot of my bed kicking it to get my attention.
<br><br>
"What?!?!" I asked with more than a little anger.
<br><br>
"You've got to help me."
<br><br>
I rolled my eyes and then sat up in bed.
<br><br>
"What is it."
<br><br>
"I bought a map last night and you need to help me get there."
<br><br>
"Why?  Is this for your treasure?"
<br><br>
He looked about the room suspiciously, as if he expected to see someone cloaked in the shadows whispering secrets to me.
<br><br>
"Who told you!"
<br><br>
"You did.  I could repeat what you said, but I'm not sure about the accent.  It was either Whiskey or Goblin Kalish and water."
<br><br>
He retracted his lips, biting them.  His secret was out.
<br><br>
"Alright, I was going to give you a flat fee, but instead since you know about the treasure you'll get a share instead."
<br><br>
"I'm not one for profit-sharing."
<br><br>
"But it's one of the greatest finds of our time.  You'll be able to retire."
<br><br>
"All things considered, I'd rather be blathering to some bar wench about the time I slew an orc commander with my after dinner toothpick and running up a tab.  I work on a daily basis.  You know that."
<br><br>
"Fine!" he said with glee, pleased to know that his 'treasure' was all his.
<br><br>
There's something about a gnome in deep thought that reminds me of the sun setting on a graveyard… there's that moment where it's all so intriguing, followed eventually by chaos and lots of praying.
<br><br>
"We leave today," he instructed as if the words would cause me to leap into service.
<br><br>
I stood, put on my pants and shirt, and stuffed a dagger into my belt before dragging my coat on.  I then announced that I was ready.
<br><br>
"Not much weaponry.  At least get a toothpick in case we encounter an orc commander."
<br><br>
I smirked and headed downstairs.  He smiled as if he were the funniest man in Norrath.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
We crossed the ocean.  I hate ocean crossings.  He said nothing of the enormous voyage, but I didn't complain since my rent was paid up, there was no food in the house to spoil during my leave, and I was being paid by the day.  First he took us by spell to Faydwer, then we journeyed to the docks, so it was nice to have hours to sit and rest while the ocean rocked me to sleep.
<br><br>
Of course nothing comes easy.  So rather than lulling me to sleep, the seas picked this day to rage.  The boat spun like a topless bar dancer.  Many a man gave their lunch back to the sea that day.  I simply climbed into my hammock and did my best to ignore the furor.
<br><br>
I asked Mixsho if I could see his map; A request which was answered with a glare that reminded me of gnolls guarding their treasure.  Only gnomes can mimic that look.  It makes me wonder how close the theologians are to truth when they say that Brell Serilis made the gnolls and the gnomes (among others).  Naturally, the map stayed secured.  He dared not even remove it and look at it himself for fear of someone catching a glimpse.
<br><br>
It wasn't until sometime the next morning that the sea calmed and I actually slept.
<br><br>
Kunark is an amazing place at times.  The sun rises here like everywhere else, but you can't help but feel like you are in a place that few other sane minds have been.
<br><br>
I followed Mixsho around the continent, pretending to guard, but I suspect the reason he wanted me along was simply to witness his find.  He knew I wasn't greedy enough to take the treasure from him… whatever it may be.
<br><br>
After some time he stopped and glanced around.  This was the first time that he seemed to not know what he was doing.  Gnomes are not known for their poker faces.  In fact, whenever I'm in Steamfont I try to round up a game because they are so prone to quick smiles and giggles.  Smart men, but they don't hide their emotions well.
<br><br>
"Are we lost?" I asked.
<br><br>
"What makes you say that?"
<br><br>
"The way you keep putting your hand on that pouch like you are considering checking the map."
<br><br>
"I forget you're a detective," he sighed.
<br><br>
We stopped at a rock and sat and he removed the small map from the pouch.
<br><br>
It was small and white, with little stains on it.  At first I mistook the paper for certain kinds of reed paper, bleached white by the sun.  I leaned forward and stared in shock when I realized what it was.
<br><br>
"A bar napkin?"
<br><br>
He shared an expression not unlike my own.  I don't think he had drawn the map from his pouch since stowing it there the night before during his binge.
<br><br>
He scratched his head and turned the map a few times as if trying to relate the scribblings to the landmarks around us.
<br><br>
"He told me to start at the mouth of the river, on the rock overlooking the docks."
<br><br>
"He who?"
<br><br>
"Ezmissen."
<br><br>
I sat down and cupped my head in my hands.
<br><br>
"Ezmissen?" I said, raising my voice a bit.
<br><br>
"Yeh.  So?"
<br><br>
"It's a bar napkin!  He wiped his face on it and told you it was a map!"
<br><br>
The little gnome shook his head in disbelief.  No, he decided, he couldn't be taken in a con game.
<br><br>
"Wake up!  It's what he does.  By the Gods.  I'll bet he charged you a few gold for the map.  Then he turned around and bet everyone around him a platinum or two that he could trick you into buying it."
<br><br>
Suddenly it all struck me funny.  It started out as a giggle but within seconds I was literally rolling on the floor laughing.
<br><br>
"I bet," I said between laughs, "he'd have gotten more money if he'd bet that he could get you to go all the way to Kunark."
<br><br>
The gnome turned red as a backside in a troll bordello.  (I don't know what's with the troll bordello references.  Guess the image sticks with ya.  But that's another story.)
<br><br>
I straightened up eventually as I saw him start to head off into the wilderness.
<br><br>
"Wait, Mixsho!  Where are you going?"
<br><br>
"To find my treasure," he said.
<br><br>
"Mix, come on!  It's not a real map!"
<br><br>
I caught up with him and seized the hand with the map in it and pointed.
<br><br>
"He wiped his face on a napkin.  What are you looking for?  Booger falls?" I said pointing at the green spot on the napkin, "The pretzel salt flats?  The ale foam creek?"
<br><br>
He pulled his hand free.
<br><br>
"I'm paying you," he said, "So you follow whether you believe me or not."
<br><br>
I paused a moment, deciding if I wanted to cut my losses and head back to the docks.
<br><br>
"It's your money," I decided.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
"What exactly is this treasure supposed to be?" I inquired.
<br><br>
"A horn of summoning."
<br><br>
"Never heard of it," I said.  "Did you research it or are you going on faith."
<br><br>
His silence told me the truth.
<br><br>
It was a few hours later that we saw a strange white rock adorning the top of a hill.  As we climbed the hill it became obvious that this actually was something white on the other side of the hills; we were only seeing it's tip. At the top we looked down into a small clearing.  Around the edge of the clearing were many rocks seemingly carved into their current shape.  The white object we had spotted was the tip of a skeletal bone from a dragon that had long ago fallen on this spot and decayed.
<br><br>
"We're here!" Mixsho declared.
<br><br>
"How do you know?" I asked.
<br><br>
"This writing right here beneath the pretzel crumbs," he said brushing the crumbs away, "It says 'dragon'.  See!"
<br><br>
I looked.  My knowledge of drunkanese does not extend to the written form.  I just shrugged.
<br><br>
We were about to go down the hill when we noticed movement.  Emerging form the bones was something amazing.  A white rhino stepped forward and snorted in our general direction, his horn tipping skyward as it shook its head once in defiance of us.
<br><br>
"Time to go home?" I asked without a hint of sarcasm, actually hoping that he would simply say yes.
<br><br>
"You distract him while I check within those bones."
<br><br>
"Distract him?"
<br><br>
"Yes.  What else am I paying you for?  You haven't done anything helpful yet!"
<br><br>
I took a deep breath and again considered the long boat trip back and how if I started now I could be home by morning.  But after mocking his find, even righteously, I felt obligated to help.
<br><br>
I stepped down into the clearing and lit a torch.  The rhino snorted and took one step.  I felt my heart thump in my chest.  Animals can smell fear, and I knew that I was giving this animal every reason to skewer me like the halfling of honor at a goblin barbecue.
<br><br>
There was a long, tense moment when the animal made gestures and guttural sounds of intimidation, to appropriate effect.  But this dance of predator and victim was interrupted.
<br><br>
One of the bones in the skeleton collapsed, causing the rhino to spin around and charge into the bones.  Within seconds Mixsho's tiny form came rushing out of the skeleton, pursued by the horned beast.  I made my way up the hill, glancing over my shoulder, hoping the little man could get away on his own.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Mixsho was ahead of me.  Actually, he was above and ahead of me.  The beast had reared back and butted him so hard as to propel him over my head and over the hill.  Fortunately for us, the thing was more interested in protecting its territory than in dinner.
<br><br>
I found Mixsho in a tree and helped him down.
<br><br>
"Wow.  Quite a flight."  I looked down at my boots, imagining the targeting sight on the end.  "I'd definitely have to buy that sight to get that kind of distance."
<br><br>
Mixsho was too dazed to know or care about what I was talking about.  I walked the little man back to the docks.  We fixed his all his ills with alcohol, as our forefathers had done before us.
<br><br>
The trip home was quick.  Mixsho cast a spell and brought us back again to Faydwer and we drunkenly stumbled away form one another.
<br><br>
"What will you tell Ezmissen next time you see him?"
<br><br>
The little gnome paused.
<br><br>
"I'll tell him I found a horn, but that I decided it was best left attached to the beast who owned it."
<br><br>
Humor was going to be his only solace in this.
<br><br>
"You'll understand if I can't pay you right way," he said, "All my available cash went into this trip."
<br><br>
"It's alright.  Knock it off next month's rent."
<br><br>
I still wonder about what the Rhino guarded.  And from time to time I contemplate going back to Kunark to rummage around that sight, perhaps to (with some help) bag the rhino.
<br><br>
Perhaps there was a horn of summoning.  And it brought a human detective and a greedy little gnome from two continents away.
