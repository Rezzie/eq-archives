This was the case for each of those passengers, minus the nervous old man who was a
mystery to the others. Sabrina was the star student of the class of Enchanters. She
would constantly remind Marissa that the World Fair was a mockery, and a parade of
the Professors children and in no way a show of talent. Sabrina didn't want to come
at all, being rather not fond of sailing, nor is she fond of sailors, nor Qeynos. The
matter of the fact was Sabrina was rather not fond of anyone, and her only friend was
her pet Iguana.

Marissa hated the lizard. Between ignoring Montgomery and looking down at the sailors
she would proclaim the absurdness of her obsession with animals. Yvette seemed to be
the only one interested in her long winded instructions about the school of Neo
Evocation and its founder. Long periods of daylight passed before a moment of silence
was upon them, when Marissa suddenly changed the focus of the idle chatter.

"So you cut up dead people?" Marissa asked in hesitation, looking to Yvette as if
they had not been properly introduced. Her locks of rich brown hair bounced in the
evening light, accenting her sharply angled face and almond eyes. Marissa wore always
her best evening gown, and seemed to live in her own world. Yvette likened her to a
party goer who never came home, and smiled inwardly at her occasional drinking.
Marissa clung to her small jug of wine secretly, even though she only drank at meals.
She sipped at it now, and Yvette waited till she was in mid swallow before retorting.
