A couple of folks had responses to <a href="../Issue86/letters.htm">Cyan's letter</a> last week, so I figured we'd post them together:

My reply:
<br><br>
The obvious answer is to be a bard!  At level 5 you can go almost anywhere 
you want on Norrath. With your drum equipped and playing Selo's beat, you 
can outrun griffons and giants and travel to any place you want to see. 
Bards also are quite challenging to play once you get some higher level 
skills and songs. We have the dual wield of a warrior but the spell effects 
of casters, and we don't have to wait for mana.
<br><br>
Did you know bards can eventually track?  charm and direct their pets? 
 Also as a half-elf you can look great in plate. Spend a few hours and get 
a bard to level 5 and see if you can cure your wanderlust.

This it to Cyan, who wanted to leave the Qeynos area. I personally liked
it a lot, but my friends didn't, so we decided to leave (well, they
kidnapped me). And we were a lil group of level 12ish players heading
for Freeport. We all made it, no one died! But what jelped us the most
was: Invisibility. My best advice would be: Make a character with
invisibility. You don't want to be a 100% spell caster, so try a druid.
(I myself am a Half-Elf druid) I could take a few hits up until highr
levels and bash out some decent hits too, yet I am a spell caster, and
the best class for discovering the world. who else gets SoW,
Invisibility, Gate, and Ring spells? All in one?

Hi.
<br><br>
I read your article comparing Everquest and Asheron`s Call.
I am currently playing Everquest AND Beta testing Asheron`s
call, and i must say that this article is filled with errors,
mainly concerning Asheron's call, but also some on Everquest.
Please take some time to be sure that what you write is how
the games are really working.

<em>[Ed. - I'd like to point out that we've not done any articles comparing EQ and AC.  We have, however,
printed a few letters to the editor about it.  We don't make any claims on the accuracy of
letters sent to us, nor do we insist on any accuracy in order to print them (proven, I suppose,
by the fact that we're printing this one...).  The only thing that we verify is that
the letter is relevant to our subject matter, isn't blatantly offensive and isn't drastically bad.
We don't even correct for spelling...]
