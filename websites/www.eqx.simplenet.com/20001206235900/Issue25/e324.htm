<b>Class Halls</b>
<br><br>
When you start a new character, you begin with a little food, a little water,
class-specific items (such as a bard's lute, wizard spell, and/or a basic 
weapon), and a tattered note.  Reading the note displays the text over your
main view, just as a spellbook would.  The text on this note directs you to
your local class guildhall.  Once you find that, you can doubleclick the 
guild master to begin a training session.  The only time I tried this, I
had five free trains available.  Some skills were free, while others would
have required monetary payment as well.  You should be able to train the
basic skills that apply to your class for free to start.  I believe that
every level gained will grant you more training sessions with your guild
master.

<b>Summary</b>
<br><br>
This article should exhaust my limited view of EverQuest at E3.  Don't
forget that this is how I interpreted the explanations and what I saw.
If anything is incorrect, feel free to mention it to the editor so a 
correction can be printed.  EverQuest should be a very exciting game,
and the talent on the development team should ensure it is a very fun
game as well.  I know I am eagerly looking forward to getting my hands
on my own copy.  If you get into the beta before me, feel free to give
me yours.  
<br><br>
Well, I can always hope. ;)
