Nigel's Revenge</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">

Nigel, wearing a robe with hood that covered his face, entered the city of Qeynos.  He walked in a manor he thought wouldn't draw attention towards himself.  The castle was at the northern top most end of the city, and quite a long walk from the gates.  The street was lined with merchants on either side.  They sold everything from food to weapons to jewelry.  Several of the merchants called out to Nigel.  
<br><br>
"Here sir, this liquid cures all your illnesses.  You need this." An old woman said.
<br><br>
"Right here is the finest bread Qeynos baker's can make!" A large man said, as he spit on the utensil he was using to remove the bread from the ovens, then wiped the spit off on his apron.
<br><br>
Nigel walked past them, never looking up.   He increased his pace.
<br><br>
Just when he thought he was in the clear, things took a turn for the worst.  Before him stood a eleven-foot figure, towering over one of the merchants, screaming over the price of a huge bastard sword, which he now held in his massive hand.  Nigel knew this beast all too well.  The giant was one of the King's prize knights named Epoc.  
<br><br>
Epoc was a unique half-human half-hill giant, and a great addition to the King's Royal court.  Epoc had come to Qeynos in search of his father.  His only description was that of one his mother had told him so many times. 
<br><br>
"Your father was a great warrior Epoc.  He was a member of the Knights of Penance, and with them, fought many battles." His mother would say.
<br><br>
In fact the truth of it was, his father was a human.  A human that had been drinking too much and slept with a female hill giant, who had also had too much to drink that night.  The man so repulse by what he had done, never visited her village again.  But out of the whole ordeal she received a wonderful, unique son.  
<br><br>
When Epoc had arrived at Qeynos he was informed that his father had been killed in battle.  He may have not found his father, but he did find the King, who immediately recruited his services.
<br><br>
Epoc raised his head, intrigued by an odor that filled his nostrils.  He tried to think where he had smelled that odor before. He thought for a moment and shouted, "Nigel!" The half-giant growled.  The giant spun around, nostrils sniffing at the air, while examining the source of that familiar odor.
<br><br>
"Hey you have to play for that brigand!" the merchant demanded.
<br><br>
Epoc ignored the merchant's declarations and walked towards the smell.  Removing anyone that crossed his path with a toss.  
<br><br>
Nigel focused on his power and chanted,  "Ewe Yatz Valamj" but to his surprise nothing happened.   Not having enough time to repeat the words he turned and ran down the alley.  
<br><br>
Epoc, now having confirmed his suspicions, began running towards Nigel.  
<br><br>
Nigel could hear the half-giant's footsteps closing in behind him.  He began to topple over boxes and other assorted objects that might serve as obstacles to slow his assailant, but the footsteps seem to get closer.  He spotted another alley off to the right and followed it. 
<br><br>
About four steps into the alley and Nigel was hit with the sudden realization that this alley ended at an abrupt dead end.  Nigel turned to face his assailant.  
<br><br>
In that moment, before Nigel could complete the turn, Epoc had caught up with Nigel and brought the broad sword down with the strength of ten men.  The blade found Nigel in the shoulder, instantly severing his color bone, while not loosing any momentum, continued into his heart, where the blade finally rested.  
<br><br>
Nigel took his last breath, and muttered "I'm freeeeee…"
<br><br>
Epoc removed the sword, and with one arm lifted his victim up in the air, and carried him off.  A line of blood followed in his path.  
<br><br>
As Epoc passed the merchant, he thew the bloody broad sword at him, nearly cutting off the merchant's hand.  "This sword no good!  You sell junk." He said, and turned towards the castle to claim his prize.
<br><br>

Balin awoke to a scream like none he had ever heard before.  As if one thousand souls had just been taken, the sound echoed inside his head.   He rose to his feet in an instant, drawing his sword.  He stood there ready to fight anything, but nothing was there to fight.  He laughed at himself and mumbled, "Must have been a dream." He laughed under his breath.
<br><br>
He had no idea he had been out, all he could remember was the ghost of the woman he had encountered on the path.   His stomach was howling at him to be fed, so he decided to continue the trip to Qeynos.  
<br><br>
It was about this time when Balin heard the first voice.
<br><br>
"Balin"
<br><br>
Balin looked around, not sure where the sound had come from.
<br><br>
"Stop looking for me you fool.  I'm here with you."  The sound had an almost disproportionate echo to it.
<br><br>
Balin looked around again.  Not seeing anyone or anything he said,  "Who are you?"
<br><br>
"It is I, Nigel.  I have died Balin.  I need your help." 
<br><br>
Nigel continued to explain everything that had happen, starting from with his relationship to the Queen.   For some strange reason Balin listened.  More than just listened, he believed him.
<br><br>
After Nigel finished his story he informed Balin about the half-hill giant that had killed him, and that he had been able to hold this plane in spirit.  
<br><br>
Balin, thinking he was going mad said, "What do you want me to do?"
<br><br>
"I want you to revenge my death.  I want you to return to the King.  Tell him your men were defeated.  Tell him what I had told you on the battlefield."
<br><br>
"You said you were coming for him, and that you were coming alone."
<br><br>
"That's right Balin.  You tell him that."
<br><br>
"Then what?" Balin questioned.
<br><br>
"I'll think of a plan when we get there."
<br><br>
"Hey I'm still living, and would have to face the consequences of my actions.  I can't kill the King."
<br><br>
"You let me worry about that.  Now get going.   I have a lot to plan."
<br><br>
Balin confused and spooked continued towards the city.  "Oh this is bad.  This is really bad."  He thought he heard laughter.
