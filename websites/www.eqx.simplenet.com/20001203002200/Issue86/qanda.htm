<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a cleric of the 20th Circle and regularly track my stats.  I have noticed that since my One Handed & Two Handed Blunt scores reached 80, they have stopped improving.  Why haven't my weapons skills improved?  I regularly use them but I just don't understand. . . .
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I interviewed a rather obstreperous Cleric about what might be happening with your weapons skills.  First, you need to remember that skills often have level caps so that you may top out on a skill and not gain in it for one or more levels.  This is usually race and class dependent.  Next, it's important to remember that if you are frequently fighting npcs that con green, your skills will not improve in those fights.  Also, often clerics rely so much on their magic that even though it seems they are fighting a lot, the actual use of weapons is not consistent.  The Cleric I talked to added that your points in intelligence will affect  skill improvement.  I'm not sure about this but figure its worth throwing in.  The same Cleric won't let me reveal his current skill levels but said I should reassure you that you have not reached the limits of weapons skill yet.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't a question but, rather, another macro suggestion which elaborates on one of the ones you mention in your article.   Line 1: /say HELP !! Please!!  Line 2: /loc    When you are in panic mode and are afraid you might die, this will do the trick.  Thanks for the great articles!

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the great idea.  There is also a little known command in Everquest for bringing assistance when you are in trouble.  You might want to try it out with some friends sometime before you actually need it.  If you want to alert others near you that you need help, just /yell.  The /yell command will say that you need help and give the player seeing it the approximate direction to travel to find you.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the deal with poison?  How do you make it, where do you buy it and how much damage does it do?

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A. A rogue I know snuck around the corner when I sent him a secret signal and filled me in on a little bit of the dangerous and mysterious world of poison.  He wouldn't enlighten me in detail, as I'm not part of the rogue brotherhood, but here is what he said:  Rogues have two skills for poison, one is Make Poison and the other is Apply Poison.  Making poison is a trade secret but he did tell me that poisons can be both bought and made.  The facts on applying poison came a little easier.  Poison can only be applied to a piercing weapon and you will need a finished poison, not the components.  You will get a message if you successfully apply the poison and you then get to go use it.  When I tried to wheedle more out of my informant, especially some damage information, he simply smirked and skulked away.  Hope this helps some.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet commands are not in my manual like you stated.  Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the pet commands should be in Appendix C, Commands, of the Everquest Manual found in your Everquest folder in your computer.  However, not wanting to shirk on my duties here, I've gone and found a list of pet commands for you including a couple  that I didn't see in my manual.  The pet commands are:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/pet as you were:  Makes pet forget all other commands including follow <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/pet attack <targetted npc>: &nbsp;&nbsp;  Pet will attack targetted creature <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/pet back off :  &nbsp;&nbsp; Tells pet to quit attacking target <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/pet follow me: &nbsp;&nbsp; Pet will follow you. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/pet get lost: &nbsp;&nbsp; Pet will suicide. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/pet guard here: &nbsp;&nbsp; Makes your pet guard one location moving only to attack a targeted  npc  that is near.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/pet guard me: &nbsp;&nbsp; Pet will attack anything around you that is an npc. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/pet whos the leader: &nbsp;&nbsp; Pet will report who summoned it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/pet report health: &nbsp;&nbsp; Pet will tell you hit point status. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/pet sit down: &nbsp;&nbsp; Pet will sit in one place and rest. <br>
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this has been asked many times, but not by me.  People keep going on about a 25% experience bonus with a group of 6.  I myself have asked a gm, the gm replied no, it isn't true.  A friend however claimed she had done the same and the answer was positive.  Please clear up this matter for me.

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A random poll of North Freeport came up with about the same answers you have and included several others including a rumor that you had to kill something that conned red in order to get an experience bonus in the group.  I did a quick search for an official announcement from Verant on this and couldn't find one.  However, a source I usually rely on has indicated to me that there IS an experience bonus for a full group of 6 players.  However, the amount of the bonus is unknown.  Just a playing editorial here:  Whether the bonus exists or not, a full group of six players representing divergent classes can smite their way mightily through some amazing battles.  Give a full group a try!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in your opinion is currently the most powerful NPC in the game?  Also, hypothetically speaking, Vox vs. Nagafen????  Has anyone even come close to killing Cazic Thule?

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;After deciding that high levels would have the definitive word on which NPC was most powerful, I headed out to a dry safe spot outside of Nagafen's Lair and asked your question.  Not surprisingly, there were a lot of different answers ranging from a_gnoll_pup00 to a Plague Rat to a merchant to Lord Nagafen himself.  (The last was said loudly in a crude attempt to raise faction with the said Lord.)    Lady Vox and Cazic Thule have both been defeated on one server or another, but I'm not sure about Nagafen.   In my humble opinion, Fippy is the most powerful NPC in the game, but his power is that of regeneration rather than player damage so perhaps that is a different category altogether.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any way to switch hotkey banks without having to use the mouse?  I have two (a combat skills and a non-combat skills) and I find that I have to switch quickly sometimes and it would be great if I could do it with the keyboard
<br><br>
My question is one I think many players would love to know.  How do you link a hotkey'd skill to your forward movement key?  I.e., Sense Heading, Forage.  I know this is possible, I've heard of people doing it.  Please get as detailed as possible, I just don't seem to understand the process
<br><br>
Is there any way to switch hotkey banks via the keyboard?  This would be much quicker than with the mouse. 


</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, to the questions on changing hotkey banks with the keyboard.  As a bard I usually have several banks going.  One for battle songs, one for exploring songs, one for instruments and weapons, etc.  When I need to change I hit shift and while holding it down, hit the number key (1 through 6) of the hotkey bank I need.   The question on linking a hotkey skill to a forward movement key is one I can't find an answer to.  Sense Heading and Forage can of course be placed on the hotkey bank.  (Note Q&A from several weeks ago addresses how to do this.)  It is also possible to place your melee slots as hot keys btw.   If anyone knows other tricks for using the hotkeys, we'd sure like to hear about them.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm curious about Tallon Zek, but am not sure what is meant by a "Race War" server, could you clarify?  Does this mean that all natural enemies, such a dwarves and trolls, will be pvp?  Thanks.

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The new race war servers, Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek, are built on the premise that there are four natural groups (teams) to be formed from the races of Norrath.  Thus you would be in a group with those closest to your race, i.e., high elves, wood elves and half elves would form a group.  You may not kill players within your own group.  However, that leaves 9 other races (3 groups) that are open to pvp killing by you.  Some players have believed that it is necessary to perform the pvp book quest in order to be able to kill other races but that is not the case.  In fact, players will want to avoid becoming +pvp on the race war servers as the switch will prevent them from joining with those of their own group leaving them weak and on their own against the onslaught of the other races.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have there been any confirmed reports of anyone receiving any amount of money by using the "beg" skill, ever?

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep, as a matter of fact, one monk in Freeport may hold the record for results from begging at one silver, one copper.  Even beggars have been begged from successfully although for a paltry copper.  It's good to remember, however, that some npc's have both a distaste for beggars and a taste for violence so "beggar beware" is fairly sound advice.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I purchased Yonder, a spell, described in Everquest Stratics as causing fear and making NPCs run away.  Instead, yonder randomly transports me similarly to Shadow Step.  No complaint about being transported but I want to know what Yonder is intended to do.  Thanks.

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not going to give away the store here, but from your experience I think you can extrapolate out that Stratics might just be a wee bit wrong on this one.  Hehe!  Couldn't resist!
