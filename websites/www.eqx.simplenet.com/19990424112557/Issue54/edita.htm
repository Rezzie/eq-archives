Now for some ramblings about the game itself.  This is going to be vague, and I'm not going to talk about everything, but take from it what you want.
<br><br>
Layout:
<br><br>
Each race has it's own starting city.  Right now the 989 team is actively tuning those cities and the adjacent areas so that they will all be about equal in playability and still as different as possible in atmosphere.  The cities themselves are stunning.  The human cities are great, if perhaps the least exotic.  But dang, I went back to Qeynos for the first time in a month and they changed it!  They completely redid the southern part of the city and I had a hard time getting around for a while.  Even as the dullest cities (built by Humans, after all) Freeport and Qeynos are pretty nice.  There's Kaladim, the Dwarven home, a solid place, built into mother earth and very… solid.  But me, I love the Gnome home.  Ak'Anon is beautiful.  Especially since they turned up the lighting a bit in there.  It's hard to describe the place (maybe I'll get some pictures for you…).  It's all green from rusted copper, yellow from magical light, and blue from the reflections off the lakes…  A great place.  The High Men live in a marble palace, like a giant laboratory.  Again, perfectly toned in white and gold.  And the Wood Elf city… you've all seen the screen shots.  They don't do it justice.  Look down from the highest platform when Greater Faydark is at it's most foggy and you won't see the ground.  The High Elf city is not too dissimilar from Erudin.  It's also sort of sterile, but with plants.  Gold, white and green dominate it.  It's been too long since I've been to the Troll and Ogre towns, so I'll leave off commenting about them.  But the one that is the most stunning is the underground home of the Teir'Dal.  There are some fantastic neon designs.  The whole place is so dark!  I've told the design folks this, and I'll tell you.  Seeing Neriak is enough of a reason to play a Dark Elf.
<br><br>
I guess the most interesting thing to note here is that I've been testing a while, and I haven't seen all of the zones.  I admit to being the type to start new characters all the time, so I've not reached any tremendous levels, and that's the reason why I've not seen the entire world.  Not only is the world pretty big, even with only about 3/5 of the land mass available, but there are some places that you just don't go unless you're ready.  I plopped my little Gnome into a zone that I knew was way over his head.  I kept him invisible the whole time.  Even so, I found myself jumping when the thunder hit, signifying the start of yet another rainstorm (I think they love the rain effect too much, it needs to rain a bit less…).  I eventually ran out of there.  I was so relieved when I got out alive that I actually felt myself relax in my chair.
<br><br>
All isn't perfect right now.  But they have some areas that are great models, and they are tuning everything up to meet those standards.
<br><br>
Mechanics:
<br><br>
Yes, there is a learning curve to this game.  I can't tell you how hard it will be to go from reading the manual to becoming somewhat proficient in the game.  But I certainly suggest you read the damn manual.  I've helped a few new players, and it takes about 15 minutes of just typing 'here's what this does, here's how you do that' stuff, 15 minutes of showing them the town, and 5 more minutes of 'suggestion - DON'T attack THAT!' before a tester is ready to go out on their own.  And that's just for the basics, and without the manual.  There's a LOT more to it then that.  Over the course of the beta things have become more and more intuitive.  As it is now it might not take that long.  I would liken the learning curve to Tanarus.  Learning the basics of "how to" won't take too long.  Learning the fine points will take a lot longer.
<br><br>
I'm just not going to get into very much detail on the interface.  If I told you just a few things, those would be the ones that changed between now and release…  It is certainly different, and I like it just fine.  There really is a nearly infinite choice of camera angles.  You can view the game from first person, rear 'trailing' view, or even something very close to the third person angle that other games use.  Heck, you can even go to an overhead and distant view and swing your camera around as you run.  Make yourself sick, don't blame me.  I distinctly remember this as one of the promises that 989 made us a long time ago that most of us took with a grain of salt.  Well, they certainly did everything they promised with the cameras.
<br><br>
Game Play:
<br><br>
I mean, so what exactly do you do in this game?  Well… you have some options.  Contrary to speculation, you can sit in taverns and gab.  I've done it.  In fact I once spent over an hour plotting an even that we wanted to try as players while in the game.  It just seemed more appropriate to do it in a tavern then on ICQ.  Heh, the EQX staff recently spent a while in a tavern drinking and roleplaying the characters from our stories.  That was hilarious.  But then, that is the exception, not the rule right now.  I can only speculate about why it is rare to see folks talking in character, even while they are out killing things.  My first thought is that I expect a lot more roleplaying then is realistic.  If my hopes and expectations are too high, then I suppose there will never be enough folks in character.  But there's more to it then that.  It has a lot to do with the fact that it is just so enticing to test your combat skills, to try out new spells, to see new zones.  I'm as guilty of it as anyone.  I was recently caught up in a binge of experience gaining because I wanted to see how well my magician would do against one of the Drakes in Butcherblock when he reached his next level.  So I ignored everything in pursuit of stuff to kill for experience.  But when some of my friends from the beta wanted to start a group of Dark Elves, I dropped that in a heartbeat.  And that group, as small of a representation of the group of testers, are roleplaying the heck out of the place.
<br><br>
You can also gain experience and amuse yourself by pursuing quests.  I'm not going into any detail on this, either, as the system and the quests themselves are still being implemented and tweaked.  I've heard rumblings about what the long term ideas behind this system are, and I like them.  But so far quests are not widely available, so we'll have to wait and see on this.  I can see the basic ideas and system behind questing, and I think there is some potential there.
<br><br>
As for combat, there's plenty of that.
<br><br>
And I the folks at 989 have anticipated most of the loopholes.  I've heard way too much speculation about how experience is given and how it might be easy to 'cheat' the system.  It's simple.  The person that does the most damage to the monster, gets the experience.  If that character is in a group, the group gets the experience.  And there are limits as to how far apart in experience these characters can be.  So a 4th level characters grouped with a 20th level will gain no experience for things that the 20th level character kills.  And, yes, a high level character could weaken a monster for a low level character to kill.  But firstly, even weakened that monster will probably kill the low level character if still over half hit points (less and the high level character is going to get the experience).  And I think there is a basic philosophy here that I like.  After 989 has put in all the reasonable restrictions on 'twinking', then all the time that the high level character is spending helping the low level one, the high level character is not advancing, so it evens out.  By the way, I define 'twinking' as using a high level character to help out a low level character so that they can advance more quickly.  This still applies if you are using your own character to help out another of your characters (say by arranging to give him items like armor and weapons that only the high level character could acquire).  And if you read the other sites you already know, a few players were removed from the beta for twinking.  I don't know what restrictions, if any, 989 will try to keep on players in retail (and I admit that it would be tough to kick out paying customers for handing down armor), but in the beta such activity can really throw off the game balance.  If 989 sees a lot of characters advancing quickly, they will have to conclude that some aspect of the game is too easy, and they will tune it to make it harder.  If not corrected before release, then we would all have to twink just to get by.  So I applaud 989 for booting those players (and they were certainly warned enough).
<br><br> 
One of the methods that can be used to determine how fast folks are advancing is through listing all of the characters on at any given time and tracking their classes and levels.  It's a great tool for checking on the balance of the game.  Someone released a list of characters on line at one moment of the game.  It showed some classes not being played as much as others.  I have two words of caution about those lists.  First, that's one moment in time.  Without including a lot of other moments, you are certainly not getting a clear picture of what's going on.  And, as was explained in our <a href="qanda.htm">Q&A</a> this week, some classes are still being tuned.  The example, Enchanters, were very broken during the early parts of the beta.  Their spells are, well, interesting.  And tuning those spells required some extra work, so the class was under powered (and still might be, a bit, but that's what the beta is for).  Rest assured that the folks at 989 are aware of what balance between the classes is.  And remember, even if Enchanters are perfectly balanced with all the other classes, there still may not be a lot of people playing them.  A lot of folks will play the classes that some web site told them was 'best'.  Others will stick with what they like.  In a world like Norrath, it makes perfect sense that there would be three times as many warriors as paladins, and five times as many wizards as enchanters (I made those numbers up, by the way, so don't think that they represent anything except, well... made up numbers).  Warriors <b>should</b> outnumber paladins.  Being a paladin is a tough thing, requiring more training, more effort, and a much greater sense of morality.  It's like comparing the number of priest to just plain worshippers...
<br><br>
So I encourage you all to hang on making any decisions about what this game will be like until you see it.  And hopefully next week we'll get to play our local D&D game again, so I can go off rambling about that instead of trying to tackle this complicated stuff.  :p
