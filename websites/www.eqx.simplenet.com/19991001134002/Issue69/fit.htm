Hoi there! This is Lrets D'pearl coming to you from Queynos with the latest in breaking news from Fit to Print. Apparently, out of nowhere, the human engineers of Queynos have succeeded in a major economic coup over the monopolistic hold the gnomes of Ak'Anon have held in the arena of mechanical pest control devices. However, with this unprecedented success a fortunate AND unfortunate consequence has arisen. The amazing "Giant Rat Trap" has succeeded in decimating the local population of the annoying Giant Rats, however there is now a problem with what to do with resulting mountains of Giant Rat corpses. 
<br><br>
    Once again, this story may not have seen the light of the, until it was noticed by this most diligent, and humble :), cub reporter that the mountains of Rat corpses were suddenly disappearing. Upon investigation, it was found that those same engineers that developed the Giant Rat traps were contracted to develop a weapon to use against the Gnolls of Black Burrow ...

<p style="text-align: justify">
.... Through the judicious use of Elemental magics and steam power, human engineers have developed a high caliber rat catapult capable of hitherto unknown devestating power. However, this reporter was unable to get any Queynos High Officials to give any comments. As reflected by Antonius Bayle's response of "No comment!" to our questioning. Furthermore, 
we attempted to interview leading Gnolls as to what they felt about this development, but were able to get nothing more than a... "You may have destroyed your lands, but you'll not do the same to mine!!! BBBBAAARRRRKKKK!!!!" from a local Gnoll Commander.

    More to come as more information is released. Stay tuned to Fit to Print for the latest breaking news. 
 <br><br>
This is Lrets D'pearl, aspiring Bard Extraordinaire of Karanas, and Cub Reporter for Fit to Print signing off.
<br><br>
Tune in next week for more information which may yield startling results as the question behind what the flying cirlces in the skies above the Desert of Ro may be, and the addition of a virtual swimming arena at Black Burrow water Park. [Pictures too! :) ]</p>
