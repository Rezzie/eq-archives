Goblin drums, goblin drums beat loudly,<br>
Rousing us from our sleep.<br>
Goblin drums, goblin drums pound doo-oom<br>
To our homes and our keep.<br>
So we rise, so we rise to confront the foe,<br>
Wanting peace but daring war.<br>
Goblin drums, goblin drums must be silenced<br>
Forevermore.
<br><br>
Dwarven hearts, dwarven hearts beat strongly<br>
With the life of our land.<br>
Dwarven hearts, dwarven hearts draw courage<br>
>From the strength of our band.<br>
So we march, so we march with eyes lifted high<br>
To the bright light of our star.<br>
Goblin drums, goblin drums must be silenced<br>
Forevermore.
<br><br>
And the blades of our swords glisten<br>
Keenly in the clean light<br>
Of the moon,<br>
So bright, so bright.
<br><br>
Goblin drums, goblin drums like thunder<br>
Echo loud in the night.<br>
Goblin drums, goblin drums beat danger<br>
As we gird for the fight.<br>
So we go, so we go with a steady tread,<br>
Marching grimly off to war.<br>
Goblin drums, goblin drums must be silenced<br>
Forevermore.
<br><br>
Dwarven hearts, dwarven hearts like drum beats<br>
Pound so loud in our chests.<br>
Dwarven hearts, dwarven hearts beat faster,<br>
No more thought now of rest.<br>
So we strike, so we strike in a mighty wave<br>
'Neath the cold light of our star.<br>
Goblin drums, goblin drums must be silenced<br>
Forevermore.
<br><br>
And their blood on our swords glistens<br>
Blackly in the bleak light<br>
Of the moon,<br>
So bright, so bright.
<br><br>
Goblin drums, goblin drums fall silent,<br>
No more sound do they make.<br>
Dwarven hearts, dwarven hearts sleep soundly<br>
No more drums to awake.<br>
So we come, so we come to our hearth and home,<br>
Marching gladly back from war.<br>
Goblin drums, goblin drums will be silent<br>
Forevermore.<br>
Goblin drums, goblin drums will be silent<br>
Forevermore.
