<b>Part Fifteen</b>

Gwyn crouched in the shadows on a warehouse near Freeport's West Gate, watching the Militia gate patrol loll in the shade.  They barely looked up as travelers passed under the arches, heading in and out of the city.  The tide was for the most part human.  Twice, a half-elf man had come through, and both times, the guards had leapt to their feet with a speed that belied their laziness, hustled the man away from the crowd, and hauled him into the guard building.  The first man had had friends with him, who protested loudly at the treatment, and was released shortly after<b>...</b>

I've always been of the opinion that I am far too young to write out a will.  But since my father died at such an early age and left my family destitute, I felt it necessary to keep the Freeport tax authority from seizing all of my goods.  And after these past few days, adventuring with Absor, I've never felt so close to death.

I've had to have this work scribed for me.  I've gone to shops frequented by the wizard types, as they are the most literate, and managed to hire one to put down my thoughts on paper for me.  I can do little more than sign my own name, and often because I am told that my signature looks like it says "Falryx" I opt to sign with an "X" in lieu of my name.  Any flowery words you find here will be the embellishments of the scribe I hired, a high elf named Archanalia.

I learned a lot in the land of Norrath on this day.   If you have a moment you could sit down a listen.  I only hope you receive a sliver of the knowledge I have gained.  Today in the land of Norrath I died six times.  How you ask?  Oh, no worries, I will tell you how my poor child!

When Darvinn and t'Ceira saw each other again, their hearts were full and their soul's were sad.  t'Ceira jumped to hold her love and flew right through him as if he were air and the curse was sealed.  What they didn't know was the Hargor's spells were set to take effect the moment they tried to touch again.

Imagine spending all of your spare time working a second job.  Picture using a headset for your phone so that you can do dishes and handle customers or fellow employee questions.  Picture taking a vacation from your first job so that you can make a business trip for your second job.  Imagine living a life where you are scraping together every spar moment of your life just to meet deadlines for this extra job.

A recent thread on the Stratics Westwood tavern board got me thinking, so I'm going to plagiarize from my post and add to it.  The thread was titled <b>Role-playing - what does it require?</b> The general thrust of the conversation was that Verant was not supplying enough for us to role-play in Norrath.

This will be breif. All I want to know is have you all given up on that
story about T'ceira and Darvinn? I was enjoying it very much (being a
sap for romance stories I guess). Anyways I was really enjoying it and
hope you continue writing it cause you havent had one out in about 10
issues :(

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Halfling Warrior that is concerned with the number of stuns I often receive.  Recently, while in Guk, I was stunned six times while pulling from 200 feet away.  What factors most enter into why, or what determines why, a character is stunned.  Thank you.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't exactly an EQ question directly, but here it goes anyway. What type of programming would one go about studying in order to make a massively multiplayer online game such as EQ. I would think it would be a mix of many things, but I just thought I'd ask.
