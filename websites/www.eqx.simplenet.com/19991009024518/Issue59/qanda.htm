<I><B>Q:</B>Will rogues be better in archery since they have a better dex, or will rangers still be better?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Stats are not the most important thing in determining the best archer.  Much more important is the skill called archery.  Whichever player has the higher skill will likely be the better archer.  I wouldn't be surprised if rangers have a higher archery skill cap than rogues, thus giving rangers the advantage.

<I><B>Q:</B>If, when you die, you are suddenly "warped" back to your bind locale, how would a resurrection spell work?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>I haven't seen one in action, but it would likely bring you back to your body, fully equipped, and restore a fraction of your lost experience.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>What's the difference between being knocked unconscious and being killed? Once you are knocked unconscious can you be killed? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>While you are unconscious, you can still see things happening around your character, but you lay completely vulnerable on the ground.  If the monster attacking you is killed, you may very well wake up.  Or, a caster will be able to cast a simple healing spell to awaken you.  However, monsters do not leave you alone after you get knocked out.  A few quick hits, and you will be killed.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Is there a way for me to move my character across servers, or do I at least have a way to pick which server to begin a new character on, so that my friend and I can EverQuest together? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>RedEye is planning to provide a way to transfer characters across servers, but it will not be an easy process.  Phase 4 is the first phase to involve multiple servers, so these issues have yet to be addressed.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>How many characters can you have?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>You can have up to 8 characters per account.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Is there a class that allows you to have skills like tailoring, blacksmithing, etc?  How do tinkering and blacksmithing work?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>These utility skills are, thus far, not specific to any class.  Everyone can tailor, tinker, blacksmith, etc.  However, most of these skills have not yet been completed, so questions regarding how they work cannot be answered at this time.  Most likely they will each require a special "kit", which is a small container with a "combine" button.  After gathering the proper ingredients, the player would place them into the kit, and combine them to create the new item.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Is the guard reaction related to the power of the character?  Specifically, would they mindlessly attack a 48th level Shadow Knight or would a dangerous reputation protect a character?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>If guards behave like other monsters, they may well leave you alone.  It appears that once you are a high enough level, many of the lower level monsters will not attack you.  This does help you reach your targets without having to wade through worthless monsters.  However, I would expect there to be some pretty high level guards protecting cities, so you will still need to be careful.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>I've been told that Troll/Ogre type characters will be harassed in Elven type towns; is the reverse true as well? Will a human be in danger from the Ogre guards?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Yes, as racial enemies, troll and ogre guards will pummel most foreign visitors as soon as they see them.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Is there a "skill cap" where you have a maximum number of skill points divided between all the skills, or is the maximum of each skill based on race and/or class?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>When you gain a level, you get a fixed number of training points that you can spend or save up.  However, skills also increase through practice, and are not interdependent.  It is possible to practice every skill to your race/class combination's maximum.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>If the character you are playing dies and you do not want to play this character any more, will you be able to delete this character?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Yes, you have the ability to delete and create new characters at will.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>How does your size affect you? Do you see things in the game from a different viewpoint if you were small? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Absolutely.  A gnome will need to look up in order to see the face of a barbarian.  High elves will need to stoop over in order to enter many of the dwarven buildings.  Smaller size characters are able to fit into many more corridors and tunnels, while larger characters are able to climb over larger obstacles.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Can half-elves see in the dark?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Yes, half elves do have infravision.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>I am considering being a Cleric, if I was to try to heal someone in the heat of battle, could I click on his name at the corner of my screen of do I have to actually click on the person?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>You can target members of your party by clicking their name in the party members list.  For others, you will need to target them by clicking their body or selecting them with a keyboard targeting command such as 'n'.
