<b><em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
I have noticed in my travels of Norrath that I have, on occasion, seen strange, "giant" gnomes. These gnomes are the height of an average human, yet keep their gnomish appearance. I was wondering if there was some sort of a mysterious cross-breeding experiment going on in the Grobb that we should know about?

Dear Azuri
<br><br>
   Moog have same troubles when she young, too!  What you need is big group of friends to help you barsh baddies.  Listen to miss shadowknight.  Next time you want to go barsh stuffs, go ask her to come wit you.  You do fine, make troll momma proud of you!  It always segnif…sicnaf…big when girl asks you home to meet the folks.  So think good before you go!  On odder hand, if you get second thoughts, can always barsh her on head and then run away.   Moog had this happen to her once…

<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
I have fallen in love with another High Elf, but I cannot help wondering if he is the one for me. I have never left my forests, and think that I may be over eager in my youth in wanting to settle down. The other day, a nice human said something about my legs, and was wondering if other races are as gracious in their compliments? Should I experiment with inter-racial relationships before setting down? Would it help my love life?

Dear Confused
<br><br>
   Best way to have good love live is to have big one.  You still be young!  Live life big, travel, meet peoples all over.  If dis High Elfie guy is the one, you will find him at end of travels, and all will be happy.

<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
I am a High Elf Cleric of the 32nd rank, and though I have met hundreds of High Elf males, none  seem to inspire me to more than disdain. They are all such,... such.... dorks ! I know I must marry within my own race to preserve the High Elven bloodline and heritage, so what can I do?

Dear Morgaine
<br><br>
