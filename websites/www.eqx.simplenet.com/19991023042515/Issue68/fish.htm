<p style="text-align: justify">Every so often I take a break from the pressure to kill orcs, goblins and other menaces to the Butcherblok community and pack a nice lunch, grab a few beers, and go fishing.  While many individuals fish to supplement their food supply, or even to sell fish to fulfill their ever-hungry need for better equipment, fishing, to me, is it’s own goal.  There is nothing like sitting on the Butcherblok docks and seeing the sun rise over the water, or to see the day sky turn purple as it slides into darkness.  It’s quite peaceful, and is a little more relaxing that what I spend most of my time doing.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I first started fishing when I got tired of the typical fare available at most food stores.  Iron rations, blech!  Who makes this stuff?  I had a hankering for something fresh that was not cut out of one of my kills, dripping with blood.  Something light and fresh… like a fish.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I gathered some funds up and bought a pole and some bait.  Some people like to use grubs foraged from the surrounding area, but I usually find that by the time they get to my hook, they are old and a little dry.  Fish like living, wriggling things, and a grub just doesn’t have much get up and go after living in an adventurer’s pack for a few days.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Since I was in Kaladim at the time, I decided to attempt fishing in the streams that run through the town.  I quickly discovered that the water is a bit heated from forge runoff, and some areas are more comfortable than others.  If you are going to fish in a town, find a quiet spot, without a lot of traffic.  I doubt it affects the amount of fish you catch, but really, do you want to fish in Ak’anon, with the effluvium from the Gnomish machinery?  Forget your fire beetle eye, use one of those fish for light.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I decided to go out to the docks, and there found my favorite spot.  I avoid the dock that the boat comes to, as my lines get tangled with the boat when it comes in, and weary travelers who get off the boat aren’t really the company I always want.  I’ll wave from my dock, but I’m not about to have a bunch of crazy humans or barbarians spoil my commune with nature.  Besides, they are usually thirsty, and want some of my beer.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">So there I was, on the dock, pole in hand, and bait in my pack.  I whipped my line forward, and heard the satisfying plop! of the bait hitting the water, and the little sparking of the water rippling out from where the line hit.  I waited for a bit, and when I felt a little tug on the line, pulled back with excitement, and caught a fish… scales.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">When you are new to fishing, all kinds of crazy things happen.  I’ve pulled up old sandals, rusty daggers, and even half eaten fish.   It takes a while before you can get a sensitive enough feel for the line to be able to pull back fish most of the time.  Until you’re at least below average at it, expect the following things:</P>

<ul>Moldy sandals, fish scales, and rusty daggers.</ul>
<ul>Losing your bait to the fish.</ul>
<ul>Long sequences of throwing our your bait and getting nothing.</ul>
<ul>Broken poles.  This happens 2 or 3 times in the beginning, but I’ve been using the same pole now for about 2 months, so it’s definitely an early risk that goes away.</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify">Potentially the worst thing I’ve seen is this: sometimes, you spill your beer bringing your line back in.  Once I had to jump in after it, and it tasted a bit funny after I rescued it from the vasty deep.  Thank Brell, I had some backup beers to wash the taste out.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">The good thing is that as you get better, you pull back more fish.  I’m at the point now when I get a fish every 3 or so tries, and rarely get anything else, or lose my bait.</P>

<B><p style="text-align: justify">Fishing with friends!</P>
</B>
<p style="text-align: justify">My good friend Kakur and I have often gone fishing together, and it’s as much fun to fish with him as it is to take down an orc legionnaire!  We have great times, swapping stories, drinking beer, and fiercely competing to get the most fish.  We’ve devised a format for a fishing tournament, and will probably run one with some friends soon. For some reason, people these days are more crazed about killing bad guys than about fishing.  Hopefully, they’ll come to their senses soon.  Using a point system, with everyone starting with 20 baits, here is the scoring:</P>

<ul>For hardware:&nbsp; 5 points</ul>

<ul>Per fish:&nbsp; 20 points</ul>

<ul>Spill your beer:&nbsp; Dive in to rescue it!  This may slow down the fish you catch over time, but it is vital to your enjoyment of the process.  Fishing without beer is like fighting without a weapon: without the right equipment, you’ll miss a lot.</ul>


<p style="text-align: justify">Possible Prize categories:</P>

<ul>Highest point total</ul>
<ul>Most fish</ul>
<ul>Most hardware, sandals, etc.</ul>
<ul>Speed fishing – first person to catch 10 fish.</ul>
<ul>Speed fishing – first person to catch 15 fish.</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify">A perfect score would be 400 points; not a bait lost, not a piece of hardware hooked.  Kakur and I have both come close, but we aren’t perfect yet.  Someday, that perfect fishing zone will occur, and fish will magically hop into my bucket.  Then Kakur will have to buy me a case of beer, and I can drink it with him, all the while talking about the big one that didn’t get away.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">My favorite fishing spot is the Butcherblok docks.  Send in your favorite spot, with the reason why you like it, and I’ll put it in the next fishing article! <a href="mailto:oghma@bv.net">&lt;oghma@bv.net&gt;</a></P>
