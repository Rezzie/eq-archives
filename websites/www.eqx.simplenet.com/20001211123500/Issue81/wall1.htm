<br><br>

"...and so the great goddess Tunare, Mother of All, came upon a small island, and this she named Faydwer, and on it she seeded a race of..." Blah, blah, blah. Falundir found the afternoon classes the most boring of them all, with that red-faced priest Fyrdian waffling on about the history of Faydwer. As if she didn't know it all ready! Next he would go on about the founding of Felwithe. Falundir smiled as he began intoning "...and as the foundations were laid, the elvenkind realized what a wonderful city it would grow to become, and they set about to make it even more glorious, enchanting powerful protective magics into all the walls of Felwithe. This is what..." <em>Gives them their wondrous glow</em>, thought Falundir. She was right again, of course. Most of the class had known this scripture since they were old enough to hold a book, but Fyrdian wasn't really trying to teach them. No, he was concentrating on the troublemakers, the ones who wouldn't learn, ones like Lusirita, a popular yet particularly odious member of the class. Falundir doubted that she would ever learn, but that wouldn't stop her graduating and getting a decent job. With the only requirement to get your diploma being money, Lusirita's future was inevitable. 
<br><br>
It was later that day, when the class broke up, that Falundir and her friend Talamon walked down to the riverside to have a swim. The pool in Felwithe was a popular spot, as people could catch fish there for free. Today Talamon was in a strange mood, and Falundir asked what the problem was. "I dunno Fal," he replied, "but doesn't this all seem a little mapped out? I mean, our career path was decided for us before we were born".
<br><br>
"Well, I suppose so," Falundir conceded, "but we do have some choices".
<br><br>
Talamon wasn't convinced, however. "I don't" was his simple reply. Talamon had strict and orthodox parents, who had plans for him to be a City Guard. Falundir had it easy: her parents had never forced choices on her, and were considered rebels in Felwithe high society.
<br><br>
"C'mon then, let's do something now!" exclaimed Falundir, her bright eyes dancing, "Let's go and check out Faydark!"
<br><br>
Talamon's eyes widened. "You know it's dangerous out there! There's... em... bats... and... em...well my parents say that only ruffians and vagabonds go there!"
<br><br>
Falundir turned to him, and said "Well I heard that there are lots of heroes and monsters there. C'mon, it'll be a real adventure!" Falundir slowly pushed, pulled, heaved and shoved Talamon towards the gates of Felwithe.
<br><br>
As they crossed them, and entered the Faydark forest, one of the guards looked hard at Talamon, and said "I don't think your mother would approve of you out here!"
<br><br>
Talamon had forgotten that his father was on guard duty at this time of day. "Quick, run!" yelled Falundir and laughing and panting they ran through the forest, the Guard's cries slowly receding behind them. After a while, they stopped to catch their breath in a clearing. "Um...where are we?" asked Talamon.
<br><br>
"Dunno," replied Falundir, worried. Just then, Falundir spotted what looked like a treehouse just above them. When they investigated further, Falundir and Talamon found a series of interconnecting treehouses. Something awoke at the back of Talamon's mind: "I heard about this place - it's called Kelethin! The wood elves live here!"
<br><br>
Thinking of those 'horrid little smelly gits' (her mother's words), Falundir shriveled up her nose. "Ew... aren't they the ones that actually eat things they find on the ground... in a <em>field</em>? I mean, who knows what has been on berries and the like! No, I definitely don't want to go <em>there</em>.  Do you, Tal?"  Falundir stopped talking. Talamon was nowhere to be seen. Swiveling around, Falundir saw a small, black-faced creature with an axe. "Hello, little man..." began Falundir, "could you possibly..."
<br><br>
The orc stared up at her and said "It's High Elves like you who have ruined your land, and you're not going to ruin mine!"
<br><br>
"Oh..." muttered Falundir. The orc drew a stick from its belt and began running towards Falundir...
<br><br>
She had, of course, been to several training lessons, but Falundir had never actually fought something before. Remembering the moves her teacher had taught her, she drew her small blade and closed her eyes. <em>Down, Under, Swipe, Parry, Left Jab, Withdraw, Down, Under, Swipe, Parry, Left Jab</em>... Every so often she felt her knife hit flesh and the orc grunted. Suddenly it turned and ran. Thirsty for more blood, Falundir chased after it, rounded a corner, and... Several things happened very fast. First, she saw Talamon tied up, making gestures to his left. Second, she saw the orc she had fought turn around and race towards her. Finally, she noticed six other burly orcs following him. Natural instincts overcame all else as Falundir dived, ducked, jumped and ran through the undergrowth, glancing over her shoulder all the time at the ever-advancing orcs. Then they were on her, digging in with their sharp knives. <em>It hurts, IT HURTS</em>! she thought, and slowly she found herself slowing down, ever slower, willing her feet to carry her on, but they just could not move faster. Then, she fell to her knees, and the orcs dug in. 
<br><br>
Falundir heard voices shouting around her, voices which were mixed with her own cries of pain and desperation as the orcs attacked. Opening her eyes, she saw an orc stab down at her, pull back up, and prepare to strike again. Then, her eyes contracted with confusion as the orc sailed away through the air, its arms floundering as it attempted to gain purchase on nothingness. The expressions on the remaining orcs' faces changed from glee through uncertainty to terror, and they began to run into the trees. Several made it. Most of them did not. A sturdy hand gripped hers as Falundir was helped to her feet by a tall, rugged (and in Falundir's opinion, disgusting) man, who brandished a large sword. "Pleased to meet you, guv'nor!" said the man cheerily, as he wiped blood of his sword onto a nearby carcass.
<br><br>
"Um... the pleasure's mine..." mumbled Falundir, trying not to get in the path of this man's abominable breath.
<br><br>
"The name's Dranconiel the Tablebreaker" said the man, and gave Falundir a smile which confirmed her fears on his plaque problem.
<br><br>
"Falundir," curtsied Falundir, "and... um... how exactly did you get the title 'Tablebreaker'?"
<br><br>
Dranconiel grimaced. "Thought you'd never ask. Well, it's a long story, but I can shorten it. Picture a Freeport bar"
<br><br>
"Uh huh..." Falundir tried to see one in her mind, and failed, the nearest she had ever gotten to 'uncoothness' being a birthday party where they played 'Hunt the Pixie Wing'.
<br><br>
"Got it?" inquired the barbarian.  "Now picture several men who had just lost five of their travelling companions. Picture that one of those men proposes a drinking contest to drown their woes. Now add a lot of that rickety furniture which many of the taverns now have. And finally, picture the man who betrayed the travelling companions to Zhanherak, the orc boss, entering the bar and ordering a drink.."
<br><br>
"Ok, Ok, stop right there!" said Falundir hurriedly, "I understand." The two of them stood for several moments, not exactly knowing what to say. Then Falundir remembered why she had been attacked by the orcs. "Oh no! I forgot about Talamon!" she exclaimed.
<br><br>
Dranconiel looked at her worriedly. "Who's Talamon?" he inquired.
<br><br>
"My friend! He was captured by orcs, and I went after him! Please help me rescue him, Dranconiel!"
<br><br>
Dranconiel considered this for a moment. "Well if the orcs have him we don't have much time, lets get going!" he said, and raced off through the trees.
<br><br>
"So you'll help?" Falundir asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, of course. Anyway, the reason I came to the Faydark forest was to find Zhanherak, and I have sources that say he's assembling an army at Crushbone."
<br><br>
"An army? What would he do with an army?" panted Falundir as they ran through the undergrowth.
<br><br>
"I'm not sure... but he may be planning an attack on Felwithe." replied Dranconiel.
<br><br>
Falundir gasped - her home town was to be attacked by orcs? She had of course heard tales of Crushbone from older relatives, but her parents had always assured her that those 'idle, serpent-tongued youths' were just scaring her. The sudden reality of the situation was frightning. "Why Felwithe?" she asked, shaking.
<br><br>
"Because of the <em>walls</em>, pawn-brain! Has no one ever told you <em>why</em> the walls of Felwithe glow at night? Why they are impregnable?"
<br><br>
"Because the ancient elves cast 'protective magics' on them when they were being built." Falundir replied. She was comforted by the scripture which she had just quoted. It reminded her of a time, only hours ago, when all she had to worry about was being on time for the next school lesson.
<br><br>
"NO! Because of the ore in them!"
<br><br>
"What sort of ore?" she asked, puzzled and confused by this strange barbarian who was contradicting all she had learnt, all that the elders had taught her.
<br><br>
"The Felwithe ore is the toughest material on Norrath - and the most valuable. If Zhanherak got his hands on it... well, every mercenary in the world would work for him. And, without its ore, Felwithe would crumble into nothing!"
<br><br>
"You can't be right!" denied Falundir, tears coming to her eyes, "my teachers said..."
<br><br>
"Your teachers don't know anything! They were taught it as well!" shouted Dranconiel. "Don't you see? It's all a lie - only I know the truth!"
<br><br>
"And why's that?" inquired Falundir, "did the little man in your finger tell you?"
<br><br>
Dranconiel looked hard at her, then turned away. "We're nearly at Crushbone... look, here it is now." was all he said. 
<br><br>
They got down onto the grass, and edged their way along the ground towards the entrance. There were two guards outside, both big, tough orcs with large halberds clenched in their fists. "I'll jump them, you follow me" instructed Dranconiel. Falundir nodded, then watched as he leapt from the thicket they were hiding in and slashed one of the orcs with his sword. It turned, but another swipe sent it to the floor in its own contracting world of pain. "Now!" yelled Dranconiel, and Falundir jumped towards him and the other orc, which was now attacking. Ducking under the first blow, Falundir stabbed the orc with her dagger. Reeling, it slashed wildly, catching Falundir's chin, which started to bleed. Dranconiel plunged his sword forward, and caught the orc again. Dodging to one side, Falundir dealt the killing blow, and the orc fell to the ground. "Well done!" said Dranconiel, "we'll make a warrior of you yet."
<br><br>
Just then, Falundir heard something which made her freeze. "Hey look over here! It's little Fal, and she's got one hell of a handsome man with her! Coo-ee! Fal!" Turning, Falundir saw Lusirita and her best friend Nefetari coming towards them.
<br><br>
"We saw you leaving Felwithe, and we decided to follow! Didn't we, Neft?" said Lusirita.
<br><br>
"We sure did!" confirmed Nefetari, giggling. "You've been a naughty girl, Fal, for leaving town! And where's... oh" Lusirita stopped. "Have you gone and lost Talamon? His parents won't be happy, will they? Oh no they won't!"
<br><br>
"They certainly won't" echoed Nefetari.
<br><br>
"Great. Meet the class bimbos, Dranconiel, Lusirita, Nefetari." Dranconiel regarded the two troublemakers with something amounting to scorn. 
<br><br>
"And what's this?" said Lusirita, looking at the cave hole which was the entrance to Crushbone, "some kind of rat-nest? Let's look at it!"
<br><br>
"Oh yes, Lus, let's!" said Nefetari, and before anyone could stop them, in they went.
<br><br>
"Lusirita! Come back out," called Falundir, "it's really dangerous in there!"
<br><br>
"But I'm having so much fun!" called Lusirita back.
<br><br>
"Lusirita! Come out NOW!" yelled Dranconiel. Silence.
<br><br>
"Lusirita?". Nothing. "Nefetari?". Nothing.
<br><br>
"We've gotta go and get them!" said Dranconiel, "they may be totally horrible, but they're just kids. I'll go." And Dranconiel entered Crushbone.
<br><br>
"Dranconiel? DRANCONIEL?" called Falundir. The only answer she got was an echo of her own voice. "Dranconiel?" But Crushbone was as silent as the grave.
