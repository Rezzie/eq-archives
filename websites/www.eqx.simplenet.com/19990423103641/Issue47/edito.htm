	In my AD&D group, I'm having a dilemma.  I have lost the urge to role-play the character I'm playing.  Running around with a Halfling fighter/thief has not been as challenging/fun as I thought it would be.  I guess I'm becoming more of a spell-casting player these days.  What am I going to do now?  The campaign is in full swing.
<br><br>
	Raffles was originally designed as a sort of trickster/social character, one of those annoying rascals that you can't help but like.  An odd thing happened that really skewed the character, though, and I went with it at the time.  The party had encountered three ettins in a cave, and, for some reason, between high damage backstabs and lucky critical rolls, Raffles killed two of the three.  Suddenly, Raffles the halfing is a tank! He got all sorts of prestige from the other players, and it I think, went to his head (*cough* my head).
<br><br>
	As you can guess, that sequence of luck has not happened again.  Raffles is a tank firing blanks, going from a whirl of slashing blades to a whirl of metal, moving vaguely in the right direction. A sort of metallic tumbleweed, skipping along near the ground, but not a threat to anyone. 
<br><br>
	I need to find the love I had for him at first, and start again.  I also need to lose the halfing tank image, since that's not doing me any good either.  I'm hoping that something happens in-game, though, that re-defines him.
<br><br>
	I did have a difficult thing happen, though.  The GM gave away a sword of WAY too much power by accident, and Raffles got it.  As a player, I wanted to get rid of it, because it's a bit un-balancing, and it's a sword of such power it skews the character concept further.  During a battle, Raffles was hit badly (or pretty well, depending on your perspective) and lost his hand!  We had no money for a regeneration, but he had this sword…  I was actually grateful to lose that piece of magic so gracefully.
<br><br>
<em>(a couple of weeks pass, real time)</em>
<br><br>
	Well, remember how I had hoped something would happen?  It did.  Raffles tried to tank as two hasted fighters with magic weapons attacked the party.  Can you say puree of Raffles?  My problem was rather neatly solved.  The party's reactions were fascinating though - the GM was very upset I had died, another player asked what was going to happen with Raffles' magic cloak - the corpse hadn't even cooled… I'll miss Raffles.   I think that no matter what, though, I'll never forget those ettins.  What a battle.  Maybe the party will tell my new character the story of Raffles by the tavern fire…
<br><br>
Now I need to come up with a new concept…
