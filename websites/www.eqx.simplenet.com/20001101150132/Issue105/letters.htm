Hi Oghma,
<br><br>
Sorry this is a week late but I have been quite busy lately and just got around to reading the 100th Issue. Congrats to everyone at 
EQX on such an achievement. EverQuest would not be the game it is today without your constant support. I also very much enjoyed 
your editorial on "<a href="../Issue100/edito.htm">Infinite and Finite Games</a>" (..and the added bonus of having my name mentioned in it! ;) When I am asked what I 
am most proud of about EverQuest my first thought is always, "Hey, I named Norrath." The fact that there are thousands of people 
from all over the world who have embraced Norrath, its gods, geography and populace, and have used it as a setting for exploring 
their own creative abilities is by far the most rewarding thing about EverQuest for me. I am sure there are those who dismiss 
Norrath as being cliché or unoriginal but that was never the point of it. I believe we have the following we do in part because Norrath 
feels so darn familiar.. yet.. if you dig around a little, you discover all the little differences that make it intriguing. (Due in no small 
part to the awesome work done by our main quest designer, Tony Garcia) I am also a firm believer in "nebulous history" as a hook.. 
it allows room for conflict and debate over who knows "the Truth" and in general makes for a much more fascinating world.. Hell, if 
we all knew the truth, where is the room for the unbelievable? Was Befallen an Elf city?? If not, why is there an Elf skeleton who 
haunts it? hmm.. answers that spawn more questions = good stories in my book..
<br><br>
I also saw the <a href="../Issue100/letters.htm">letter from Briza X'Ris</a>, Spurned Cleric of Solusek Ro about some info learned from a GM (loose lips sink ships ;), 
and would like to clarify a few things that maybe you can pass on (and will be dealt with in game in time)...
Please remember that these clarifications are just what the general citizens of Norrath believe.. and faith is sometimes misplaced.
<br><br>
Fennin Ro is the god of Fire and rules that plane..
his son Solusek Ro rules the Plane of Flame, his focus is more the release and discovery of raw forms of power and energy, 
hence the strong wizard following he attracts.
<br>The information on the Triumvirate of Water and Prexus was correct. (hmm here is that Marr surname again...) ;)
<br>The information on The Rathe was correct
<br>The Plane of Sky is actually ruled by Veeshan, the Wurm Queen
<br>The Plane of Air is ruled by Xegony
<br>The information on the Six Hammers was correct.. (Has anyone seen mention of a Seventh Hammer??) ;)
<br>While the information about Tallon and Vallon Zek was correct in that they are in fact the twin sons of Rallos Zek, Rallos rules the Plane of War not the Plane of Power (the Planes of Power is actually the name used for the higher planes of Air, Earth, Fire and Water)
<br>The info on Innoruuk and Cazic-Thule was correct.
<br>Rumors of the demise of Fizzlethorpe and Mithaniel have been greatly exaggerated.. ;)
<br><br>
Thanks once again for your thoughtful and thought provoking editorials.

It is ENTIRELY my fault that this letter did not appear earlier.  I screwed up.  My apologies to Mr. Trost and our readers.  This is exactly the kind of information that I like to have, and that I love to be able to pass on to you all.  I'm not sure what happened to my mind...

 <em>Well, darn, you caught me!  We wrote that story a while ago and like many
projects I get really excited about, I got distracted and left it.  Thank
you for reminding me that it was a good story and that we (read me) really
need to think about continuing it.  I remember when we were in beta taking
screenshots for it, we at EQX had such a good time just playing together.
And I just love Mundas, Absor's character.  *sniff* I miss him!

A hearty congratulations on EverQuest Express's two year anniversary, Absor!  As I thumbed through everyone's *very* well written ruminations, I became shocked at the number of items I'd read and loved in the past, but forgotten over the ensuing months.  My thanks goes to you for allowing me to rediscover them, and please send my thanks to everyone for all their hard work in delivering this roleplayer's weekly!
