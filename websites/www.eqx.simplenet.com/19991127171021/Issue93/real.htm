Sometimes I just kill me.  I was trying to think of a subject to suggest to Oghma for his editorial, as he was having difficulty developing one.  So I came up with one, then pirated it for myself (Sorry Og).  It occurred to me that there are things about EQ that are better, worse, and nearly identical to the world we've all been raised in.  So I wondered what it would be like if Earth became more like Norrath.
<br><br>
Take a trip through the looking glass with me, won't you?
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> Traffic lights?  Bah!  I'd go walking into the street and if a truck happened to run me over, minutes later I'd just have to get out of bed, walk down to the highway and get my wallet and car keys off of my body.
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> The world would occasionally go through strange, inexplicable changes where things behaved and reacted differently.  Last week the folks in admin were stone-faced and non-responsive, but this week when I hail them they tell me I can complete the quest for the bottle of white-out by obtaining the paper of requisition, climbing to the ninth floor and having it blessed by a boss, priest, or other such person of authority, and bring it back to complete my quest.
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> We'd push on a door and on some days it would take four or five seconds for them to open.  A friend to whom you wave hello in the corridor would suddenly be way past you and getting on the elevator in the blink of an eye.  People would sometimes take on a trance-like state and wander out into traffic, off of bridges and over cliffs to their death.  There would be days where people would be holding a conversation then suddenly vanish.  They'd come back later and claim that their connection to the world was "tenuous" at best.
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> I could stand across the room, focus on a particular woman, and know right away if she were amiable, indifferent, dubious, or just plain ol' ready to attack.  Don't want to buy a drink for them attacking women.
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> I could stand on the patio at home and shout and people at my work on the other side of the county could hear me.
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> I would start out with a scroll that told me exactly what I'm supposed to be.  ("Go to the tower of IBM.  Take this parchment and give it to the Master of Human Resources, Clymendus The Scowling, and he shall grant thee training in the Computific arts")
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> Bards would not sing nor play instruments audibly.  Oh sure, they'd call themselves bards, but they would just strum the instrument and mimic the act of singing, like mimes.  I hate mimes.  Bards would be the most hated of all classes, rather than the way bards are worshipped in real life.  They'd never really produce any art.  They'd just Milli-Vanilli their way through life.
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> Fake IDs would be easily had.  After all, with only 8 or 10 faces to go around, it would be a simple process to pretend you were someone else.  Well except that…
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> I'd never forget anybody's name because I could just look over their head and not only know their full name, but where they work.  "Say, you don't work here!  Stop that man, he's a spy!"
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> The creator would occasionally give us word on things that have changed since I last went to sleep.
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> I could beam myself off this world and start over again on another one where people are different but all act the same.
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> I could skip childhood and adolescence and go straight to adulthood.  And I'd never grow old.
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> Catching a train would be a bad thing, and kiting would not be a weekend activity in the park with a kite and a long string.  Instead, think of kiting as those scenes in poorly made police dramas where the bad guy suddenly decides to stop, turn, and shoot at the cop; Except in this case, when the cop finally gives up, the bad guy comes back and shoots at him again in order to re-institute the chase.
 <br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> There'd be no transportation, but for large vessels of public transportation that go only long distances.  Yep, for free a ship (formerly called a "bus") wouldn't take me from Santa Ana to Huntington, but it would take me from Huntington to Anchorage
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> Thugs would jump out at me in an alley, only they couldn't rob me.  They'd demand to duel, and if I refuse they could only stand there and curse.
<br><br>
And finally…
<br><br>
<em>If EQ were the real world…</em> Rather than getting the most out of the world, people would stand around cursing and blaming the "creator" for all their problems, rather than accepting that its not a perfect world.
<br><br>
Oh, wait.  Maybe we have that one already.
