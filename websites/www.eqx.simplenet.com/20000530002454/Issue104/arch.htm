By no means are these easy selections to make.  There are excellent works by the entire crew, past and present.
<br><br>
My Favorite EQX Article: <a href="../Issue42/hail.htm">"HAIL RAZOR! Our Geek Master!"</a>
<br><br>
I selected this work mostly because it exemplified something that I like a great deal about our little periodical as compared to other EverQuest related sites; The ability to discuss things that aren't necessarily on topic, yet are highly entertaining.  I must say that this edged out some of Oghma's highly informative articles (such as the one on  <a href="../Issue36/paladin.htm"> Paladins </a>) and some editorials by Absor, but all of the staff have a shining moment or twelve to be proud of.

When I reread things I've written I see something I should have explained more clearly or I don't like a certain turn of the phrase.  I enjoy writing articles, but as soon as a week after I've written them I go back and discover that what I was trying to express may have come across very "muddy".  For that reason I'm going with a story instead of an article.
<br><br>
My Favorite EQX work of My Own:  <a href="../Issue89/dark.htm"> The Dark Season</a>.
<br><br>
I love writing stories based around my mildly sinister dark elf, Ezmend.  It's easy to be mean, and pretty much that's the requirement for a Tier'dal character.  I needed to put a twist on Ezmend to make him interesting.  T'daven (Oghma's character) was thoughtful and vicious, and Gainam (Absor's Character) was evangelical and vicious.  He needed to be down in the mud with everyone else.  I decided that Ezmend was an underachiever.  Little did I know that this was a prophecy of sorts, as the other members blew well past him in level (as at that time there was little that enchanters could do).  Writing him as a somewhat selfish drunkard was a great departure.  But I picked this story, which is about redemption.  I had to explain why suddenly Ezmend was climbing in level and passing the others, and the reason was that he finally gave a damn.
<br><br>
This edged out the first Mig Hammerer Mystery, <a href="../Issue41/mig.htm">The Grassy Gnoll</a> which had some of my favorite EQ similes, like "The world was about as cohesive to me as Ogre Poetry" and "I drank like a halfling channel swimmer".  The other story I liked was the pre-cursor to The Dark Season, called Self-Destruction.  I just love to make up really twisted myths and customs for the dark elves.

I still look back with fondness at the founding of our Tier'dal guild, The Fleurs DuMal.  Though most of our staff have since vacated the guild, I still think the guild had a very well anchored purpose.  And as those who have played alongside our staff can attest, they can be a blast.
<br><br>
So the best thing that came out of EQX for me was a number of friendships.  The next best thing was a sense of purpose.  At one point we were often in contact with the group of guys who had their hands directly on the game, like Brad McQuaid (Producer), Charles Flock (Beta test Manager), Bill Trost and Mike Hutchins (Designers).  This gave us the feeling that we could literally "change the world".  Few people really get input into the creation of the game they end up playing.
