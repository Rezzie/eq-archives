    Best Quest: <a href="nkarana.asp#Flute, Winds of Karana" target="_self">Flute, Winds of
    Karana</a>, buggy hermit, but nice multizone trip and Vhalen's interaction is superb</p>

    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments:</span> Cordelia Minster
    stands most typically near the spires just north of the North Karanas bridge into South
    Karana. She is missing her flute and would like you to get it for her. The flute is held
    by a hermit in South Karanas. Along the way through South Karana you should pass by a
    lonely bard, <a name="Vhalen Nostrolo">Vhalen Nostrolo</a>, at a fountain. Speak to him
    and get his tale of woe and despair. Love is an evil thing it seems. He will explain that
    he was working on a new song and would gladly give it to you, but he is missing his sheet
    music. It seems that hermit is involved again...</p>
    <p align="left">This is the most difficult part for those with good intentions. You must
    go see the hermit in the south eastern area of South Karana. If you can get him to talk,
    ask him about the flute. I was able to do so by targetting and moving around the house
    until he would speak back. Faction and your take on things determines where this goes from
    here.</p>
    <p align="left">The hermit is amiable to me and offered me the flute for the return of the
    bloody tunic from the dead body of Talym Shoontar. <a href="surefall.asp#Talym Shoontar" target="_self">Talym Shoontar</a> is also on Hagar Sureshot's wanted dead list from
    Surefall Glade. Kill him and you may solve 2 quests at once. As well as be on your way to
    solving the whole flute quest.</p>
    <p align="left">How you get the flute and music is your call. If you kill the hermit he
    carries the flute and normally one of the 2 sheets of music you need. The flute needs to
    be ran back to Cordelia in North Karanas. She will give you the second sheet of music as a
    reward and possibly more. Now take both both sheets to the bard, Vhalen Nostrolo, in South
    Karana. He will give you the new song (a bard spell) and possibly more.</p>
    <p align="left">I believe this is pretty much broken in one aspect. The door to get to the
    hermit never opens. Which means if you bring the bloody tunic to him you probably cant
    trade it unless you can figure out how to get in or get him out. However, if you cast any
    spell on him he comes out. Being frustrated with his mockery and unwillingness to open the
    door I zapped him and brought him outside. The door does still not open he walks through
    it. Verant? Anyone? Anyone? BUG! But, on a happy note after killing him (Ligge cried) he
    was resurrected and I checked him again and I was still amiable, so he did forgive me for
    the one indiscretion.</p>

    Guards</a></span><br>
    <span class="qinfo">Items Needed:</span> guard bracers<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Items Rewarded:</span> coin, minor item<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Class/Race:</span> all<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Confirmed:</span> Yes</p>
    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>Captain Linarius is
    upset about corruption and has heard of guards that are charging a road tax to travelers.
    You need to find the guard and kill him and bring proof back to Linarius. As luck would
    have it, I used to run into this money grubbing guard all the time and left him alone. The
    guard tower sits just above the McMannus farm. There are 2 corrupt guards there, Donlan
    and McCluskey. At 22nd season Donlan was a nice fight, but McCluskey would have sent me to
    my grave.</p>
      <p align="left">The items I got from the Captain were pretty minor, not at all worthy of
    your task. It does improve faction with good guards and hurts corrupt guards, obviously.
    However, make sure you don't give the Captain a bracer at random, he knows
      if its not from a the bad guards and will kill you. The also have no made
      the bracelets nodrop (argghh) - thanks to Shadeaux on the Rathe for
      confirming this - so they are essentially worthless for
      selling purposes and can probably be found free of charge on dead corrupt
      guards, as with any other loot item Verant does wacky nodrop/lore crap
      with the hunters tend to leave them on bodies for others to loot.</p>
    <p align="left">The concerned Captain will also tell you about other problems in his area,
    like Lord Grimrot. He will send you to those batty fanatical Temple of Life people and
    tell you to inform Camlend about the undead uprising and the existence of Lord Grimrot in
    Southern Karana. I have spoken with Camlend and he will not give me anymore information.
    This is those silly Temple of Life people again, anyone that knows Ligge knows I have some
    issues here. I am still trying to get them to like me and I <a href="ekarana.asp">may have
    found a way</a>...</p>
