      </a>Ocean of Tears</h4>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Not only does this zone offer lots of beautiful sunsets it can be your
      home from levels 5-60 if so desired. Some of the best memories I have of
      Norrath are due to time spent here. From a personal standpoint this is
      truly where the Cailette and Ligge saga began. We met at about age 5 in
      Greater Faydark near orc hill, she was discussing jewelcraft and I was
      being nosy, and eavesdropping as I walked by her. I stopped and asked a
      few questions as I was considering taking up that craft myself. Instead I
      met the best partner and jeweler I ever could have asked to find. Shortly
      after our meeting we found the goblins in the Ocean of Tears and spent
      many a night, watching sunsets and sharing stories about ourselves both in
      and out of Norrath. I still go back from time to time just to sit and
      think. Typically during rough times we have had, yes as any relationship
      goes we have had our low points, I go back here by myself to think. This
      place will always hold a special spot in my heart. It is also where I
      whisked her off after we eloped to share a sunset.</p>
      <p>As youngsters I highly recommend the goblin islands. A druid is perfect
      here due to the spell Harmony. The islands I speak of have multiple goblin
      spawns and they will pull in-groups of 2-3 in some spots without Harmony.
      This island set also has an ogre involved in the HeHe Meat quest, but can
      be avoided if you are careful. Mermaids also reside here, but your faction
      with them should be ok if you leave them alone. Loot is good, but can get
      heavy. I suggest binding Kaladim for the quickest gate back to sell and
      grab a boat ride back to the islands. This is also in case of deaths it is
      the shortest route. For melee types the ride home is a little tougher as
      you do need to swim under the boat as it passes and try and get up under
      the hull, using duck while there seems to help. This way you essentially
      stow away on the boat. The boat does pass between the main islands every
      22 minutes or so. Faction for the goblins helps with Rivervale and with
      Kaladim. I am seen warmly in both places mainly due to the goblin hunting
      here, Misty Thicket and Butcherblock. This place is a gold mine at this
      level and out of the way so most days we had all 6 goblins to ourselves,
      even now I see it vacant quite often. At the lower levels I do not suggest
      doing this alone. Two people will do quite well once you get the hang of
      it. I believe this will die off for you around level 8 or so and if so
      inclined you can start on mermaids, we chose not to and went elsewhere.
      Mermaids will get you to 12 or even 14 possibly.</p>
      <p>At about age 12 you run into larger ethical issues. The Sisters on
      Errolis Island are great experience and money from 12-17, 16-17 is slow,
      but easily doable. Of course, Ligge never has killed a wood elf in his
      life, but I do run around as a necromancer in another life and he had a
      blast here. I believe the Aviak Island offer and alternative here for this
      level, but the roamers on that island can be much higher so I don't really
      advise it unless you like high risk and are very observant of your
      surroundings. Good races can run across the water and fight skeletons on
      Gargoyle Island with relatively small risk around this period and with a
      group you should be ok there, also with the goblins on the island next
      door, Oracle Island as it is commonly known. I have seen halflings killing
      wood elves on Sister Island, but seeing that Cailette is a high elf I
      never had any interest in doing something so obscene. Plus it's nice to
      have a shop, with cute merchants I might add; you can sell and buy at
      later in life out here. Best advice for the good guys out there is to go
      run back to a mainland when the goblins run out and hang out there until
      16-18.</p>
      <p>At 16 things open up again for both aligned races and religions. Solo
      might be a little tough, but you have the skeletons on Gargoyle Island,
      better chance of survival on Aviak Island, and the Goblin Island right
      next door. Harmony is still a nice addition on Goblin Island and Aviak
      Island, but unnecessary on Gargoyle. You just have to be a careful puller
      here. Around 18 the gargoyles become more accessible as do the goblins and
      aviaks. As a necromancer I found the gargoyles too risky, but loved Aviak
      Island at this point. Feign death is a wonderful thing at this point in
      your life. As a druid kiting on this island is a safe bet because you
      aren't risking killing others due to your mistakes, just yourself. Worst
      case scenario you run far enough away to get the 30 seconds to camp and
      clear aggro list. Gargoyles, aviaks, and goblins - in that order of
      preference will get you to mid 20s. At this point we are back to ethics.</p>
      <p>Mid 20s is a tough road for the good guys here. The named higher level
      elves and dwarves are available. If you are like me and that is not
      acceptable there are the rare higher aviaks and goblins, but it would be a
      slow road. The bandit camp, on Seafury Island, is probably good at this
      point, but you run the risk of roaming seafurys and Gornit is near the
      camp. The bandits drop quest item for Sister quest, the rare ranger that
      spawns there has the Ivy legs container, and the leader of the bandits has
      the Errolis bracer. If you have a really good group spectres are doable on
      Gargoyle Island, but it is high risk. I suggest good aligned races run
      elsewhere a few levels and come back at 30 or higher. Mistmoore and Najena
      are among the many good places to go at this time.</p>
      <p>If you return here at 30-35 you can now go take on spectres in a group.
      They are great experience and decent money. If you are still in good with
      the elves on Sister Island you can go sell the scythes collected for as
      high as 12-14 platinum pieces. Spectres can take you all the way to 50 if
      so desired. However, you will be sick of them by then and there are other
      alternatives. Seafury Island offers plenty of full size targets and is
      probably a better place for 40 and up. They hit hard and I don't begin to
      suggest this as a solo venue.</p>
      <p>Seafurys will take you past 50 easily. At this point you are opening
      the door for the dino adventures! Alliwhatever is 50. He has a quick spawn
      time, a ton of hit points, and high resists. Three of us went there a
      while back (50ish in level) and it took us probably 15 minutes to kite, slash, and melee our
      way to victory. Another person with us would have helped a ton. However,
      we were on a diamond hunt so I could get a ring made for other purposes so
      we had to try. He does drop spell components and gems. Being 50 though he
      is a battle, but one of the few nonKunark, nonPlanes places to get these
      sort of gems. I hope to go back and get one soon. Also being 50 he should
      give experience all the way to 60 even after the seafurys die out for you.</p>
      <p>I think I covered most of what Ocean of Tears has to offer. I left out
      a few quests, the chest below the sister dock, the drops from the goblin
      headmaster, Oracle quest (it still broken?), Koala nut for stein quest and
      a few others. I will leave those to you to find on your own. If I
      blatantly left out something worth mentioning please let me know. I hope
      this help some of you out, I know as a druid with SoW and levitate this
      place is a blast to just go explore. Nothing can catch you if you run by
      the wrong thing and you can always gate home if you need a quick escape. I
      know someday soon I may bring a whole crowd here to share in another new
      adventure, but that remains to be seen as some issues of that there are
      still undetermined. Hopefully you too can have a few good times here as I
      have. When and if Ligge decides to visit Karana for the final time in all
      likelihood it will be here I decide to rest.</td>
