    Who is Ligge and what is this site about?</font>
    <p>The quick and easy answer is a halfling druid with a stubborn attitude.
    However, to give people a little bit of an idea about this site and who I am
    I figure more of an explanation is in order.</p>
    <p>I found Everquest about 3+ years ago when it was nothing more than a
    &quot;coming soon&quot; website and a private behind the scenes beta
    program. I applied probably 5-6 times and was finally accepted near the end.
    Since then I can probably count the amount of days I haven't played on both hands. I am scared to count the true total but just a rough
    addition of the days played on my too oldest characters comes to over 2500
    hours in Norrath since the official release.</p>
    <p>This site began as a personal journey and spoiler site. After completing
    a vast majority of the quests in Norrath and posting about half of those
    here I came to a conclusion. I was bored. I was frustrated. I was fed up
    with what sites like mine had done to certain people in Norrath.</p>
    <p>People like Nillipuss, Kurrpok, Mitty, Gynok, Wilthin, the Oracle...
    those poor Koalindl fish... these guys don't even get to see a sunrise anymore. There
    are hundreds of others that are slain within moments of their birth. I met an
    elf recently that needed directions to Qeynos from Rivervale yet had already
    collected 2 of the 4 items needed to be a Stein runner. He knew what he
    needed and where to get them, but didn't know how to travel from one side of
    the continent to the other. That bothered me. People have turned into
    experience and money farmers and have neglected the activities that makes
    Norrath what it is, a place of adventure and mystery.</p>
    <p>I can still remember the first time I traveled from Greater Faydark to
    Rivervale and the fear that possessed me. Would the boat sink?
    &lt;snicker&gt; What was over that next hill? Now we have maps printed or
    older characters pass down money so we can buy teleports. Taking a first
    level character from Kelethin to Permafrost is almost a breeze, a few maps,
    a little twinked plat and you can port halfway there, get bound, and buy a
    SoW.</p>
    <p>So the majority of what I would consider &quot;spoilers&quot; are being removed.
    The EQSites page will give you what I feel are the best places for this sort
    of information. I use them too. There is a time and place for everything.
    Verant has seen fit to keep enough broken quests in the game since release
    that these sites still provide a good service. They can answer 2 questions
    for you that will save you 100's of hours and bad faction hits from trying
    to complete a broken quest. - Yes Verant I am still pissed I completed the
    original BROKEN stein quest many many times and am now KOS to the Temple of
    Life as you all continued to lie and say it was working. Anyway... these
    sites will tell you if the quests works and what to do just in case you are
    possibly doing it wrong yourself. For that reason I will always use them
    myself. Plus its a lot easier to recheck a web site than keep tons of pages
    of notes yourself when you forget what else you need to go with Thistle's
    Rune of Ivy and you are halfway around the world from the quest giver.</p>
    <p>Another benefit for &quot;spoiler&quot; sites are skill based recipes. At one time I
    bought many of the books for baking, brewing, fletching, etc. However, we have
    limited bank space and sooner or later those books are expendable. I still
    encourage people to buy these things, however instead of transcribing the information
    go print out the other sites that posted them, for yourself. Something
    else to think about... it was
    confirmed, unconfirmed, denied and reconfirmed a few times that holding the
    appropriate book when doing trade skills helps your success attempts.</p>
    <p>Maps... I have been in Rathe Mts enough that they are erecting a statue
    soon on my behalf, however I still get lost. So for that issue I think
    maps are a good thing. I have never printed out a map before I have been
    somewhere. I always go in blind the first time, but after a while its nice
    to have that map handy.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I understand the reasons people do the things they do. The tonic
    quest for example. I personally disagree with the flat out excessive
    repetition of a quest to gain levels and it was things like my quests
    section that encouraged that behavior. I don't fault people that did it, I
    just don't want to be a catalyst for that behavior. The day after I posted
    my original findings on the Nillipuss quest and got the Runner's Ring and
    Traveler's Pouch there were 8 separate people camping the spawn spot when I
    showed up and they all knew me and my site. I was embarrassed. So they are gone.</p>
    <p>I will still review certain quests, most often the possibly
    &quot;unsolved&quot; &lt;read as broken, Brad&gt; ones we still have amongst
    us. Its funny that months ago it was said Fiery Avenger was just not found
    yet, but was in the game and that things were being adjusted or looked at
    since we had not found it yet. Funny how that is not the story now.
    Hopefully we can get them to fix/implement the others soon too.</p>
    <p>So from now its mainly just going to be editorials, rants, reviews, and
    maybe some shared adventurers. Hopefully you won't mind. If you have ever
    gotten like me, a tad bored and frustrated, I think if you step back and
    stay off the spoiler sites a bit and try to discover things again on your
    own you might just put some fun back in Norrath for yourself too.</p>
    <p>Enjoy,<br>
