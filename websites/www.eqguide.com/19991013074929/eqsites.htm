    <p>Who are we to judge Everquest hints and news sites?</p>
    <p>Absolutely no one and we offer up no credentials to say otherwise. Except we play the
    game daily and surf the web when the servers are down. Where do we look when we want
    answers and information?. Hopefully this guide will help narrow down your searches for
    Everquest information. These review are based on user experience only. If the sites don't
    seem to be being updated they don't get listed. If we missed something or you want us to
    take a look at yours tell <a href="mailto:ligge@eqguide.com">Ligge</a>.</p>
    <p>We also don't plan to list web sites that are only server specific or entirely class
    specific - well except Druid stuff, after all a druid is writing this so a little bias is
    allowed, and possibly others that are specific to our team of travelers and contributors.
    That doesn't mean the others are bad pages we are just more interested in information that
    is specific to all servers and all adventurers journeys. If you feel I missed a GREAT area
    that should be recognized on any of these sites or another one that is even better, <a href="mailto:ligge@eqguide.com">let me know</a>! Opinions are always welcome, just usually
    ignored.</p>

    <p><a name="EQVault" href="http://www.eqvault.net" target="_top"><font size="2">EQVault</font></a>:<br>
    Why bother even reviewing this one.... If you play Everquest you have probably already
    been here. More daily news and information than any other site. They have a wonderful &quot;<a href="http://www.eqvault.com/scan/" target="_top">server status</a>&quot;
    page to allow you to check if EQ is up and well before you even truly
    logging in. Warning this page is very slow when servers are down and we are
    all checking over and over again.</p>
    <p>The most important asset I feel EQVault brings to the Everquest community is their
    message boards and their front page newscenter. Supporting 30 boards they are the most
    active I have seen and even garnish posts and responses from the Everquest producers. The
    closest thing to a true direct line of communication we all have to the people that make
    our world. The only problem is there have been a lot of infantile, flaming posts by the
    immature set. You guys know who you are. This page is still the best site for up to the
    minute happenings around Norrath!</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, as with any large site some information gets out dated and stagnates.
    They would do well to take a walk through through their entire site and dump the old and
    invalid information that is still available, here is one from a front page link to get
    them started - <a href="http://www.eqvault.com/thegame/betainfo.shtml" target="_top">Beta
    Information</a>.... Too much sometimes can be too much.</p>
    <p><a name="EverLore" href="http://www.everlore.com" target="_top"><font size="2">EverLore</font></a>:<br>
    Second best looking EQ web Site I can find. Now of course there is some bias there since I
    own one of the competitors. Looks good, and pretty useful. Information seems to be pretty
    accurate, whereas some of the others obviously don't check up on their submitters. I see
    great potential for this site due to the fact they seem to have better skills in web
    design than most others.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately they suffer from the same problem most sites do. They are trying to do
    too much. Pick a topic and concentrate on that seems to work best, but no one seems to get
    this just yet. As with other sites a lot of the information is sparse or incomplete. Still
    a very worthwhile visit though.</p>
    <p><a name="EQLizer" href="http://gameznet.com/eq/" target="_top"><font size="2">EQ'Lizer</font></a>:<br>
    Spoilers, Armor information, Spells, Weapons, Magic Goodies!! Can't find a quest in
    Norrath? They know where they are. Want to know what armor you have to look forward to at
    later levels, or what great weapon is around the next bend? They have it too.</p>
    <p>The best thing EQ'Lizer offers is the item database they have. You want to find an item
    they are the onlyplace worth looking. If you start there for that sort of information you
    probably won't need anywhere else.</p>
    <p><a name="Allakhazams" href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/" target="_top"><font size="2">AllaKhazam's Magical Realm</font></a>:<br>
    Another inclusive information site. Here is something that Yahoo proved a long time ago..
    you don't have to look good to be useful. Lots of quest info, some faction info, and more.
    I found more quest information here than anyone else in one visit!</p>
    <p>I found navigation easy and most pages with semi valid information, alas the brewer's
    guide needs some work (we know that's the first thing Ligge goes to on all sites), but the
    first listing I have easily found for all the commands, or most of them, and the first
    table on faction hits I have seen available. Hopefully this will always be updated and
    eventually completed as much as possible.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><a name="ForeverQuest" href="http://eq.mgon.com/" target="_top">Forever
    Quest</a><br>
    </font>For the true role-players among us! From their own mission statement: &quot;Forever
    Quest will be gathering a sizable group of role-players on each game server. These groups
    will work together to provide a positive role-playing experience through frequent quests.
    Each group will be sub-divided into different factions who will be working for different
    in character goals. Freelance players who are outside these factions will also be
    accepted. The first of these quest will center around the Heartstone.&quot;</p>
    <p>So if you are tired of hunt, meditate, heal, hunt expeditions; or are in need of a
    little more organization or community involvement this is your place. It's not for
    everyone, but I would suggest at least checking them out, they have some great ideas and I
    believe will do nothing but add to the experiences Norrath has to offer. Not for the
    Doom/Quake mentality people. Only for those that enjoy some true adventure, role-playing
    and strategy in their lives.</p>
    <p>Of course I do blame them for Fennin Ro's overcrowding. Unfortunately the emphasis for
    a RPing server and the infancy of Forever Quest all began in beta on Fennin and, as is
    obvious, many people flocked there after release. Too bad there wasn't away to block the
    hack and slash mentality users from Fennin on day one and make it a role-playing only
    server... aye, but I digress.</p>
    <p><a name="EQStratics" href="http://eq.stratics.com/" target="_top"><font size="2">EQ
    Stratics</font></a>:<br>
    Lots and lots of stuff here for an inquisitive traveler. The best place for city maps
    available in my eyes. It is unfortunate that they do not have grayscale versions setup
    with printing in mind. Maybe one day they will. If you take their colored versions and
    convert them yourself it helps somewhat but it takes a lot of ink to print that new black
    and white map you converted when 80% of the map is gray or dark ink due to the original
    colors used. Also, don't bother with their &quot;zone&quot; are, most are dead links.
    Still well worth the stop!</p>
    <p>Some of the guides are incomplete or inaccurate, but alas everyone has their own unique
    journey in Norrath so its hard to fault them for the discrepancies. One page comes
    immediately to mind though.. the <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/skills_trade_br.shtml" target="_top">brewers guide</a>. The approximate cost listed is if purchased from a tavern
    not if supplies are purchased and the drinks made, the supplies aren't even listed that
    are required to make each drink or in what order a young brewer can make them. Not really
    sure if they can justify calling this a guide. Its more like a merchant or tavern menu
    reprinted. Granted I am reviewing this as a frustrated brewer...</p>
    <p><a name="Words of Enchantment" href="http://www.sitepowerup.com/mb/view.asp?Action=Display&amp;BoardID=102010" target="_top"><font size="2">Words of Enchantment</font></a>:<br>
    Very active message boards with an obvious slant towards enchanters. There is some good
    discussions for every class and role-playing in general. One big advantage they share with
    EQVault is longevity, having been around a while they have some of the most experienced
    players posting to their boards. Some posters still having beta board access so a lot of
    the true &quot;behind the doors skinny&quot; can be found within their postings. Our
    resident enchanter spends her entire work day within these pages. Please don't tell her
    employer.</p>
    <p><a name="OfficialEverquest" href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_top"><font size="2">Official EverQuest Site</font></a>:<br>
    The Sony/Verant home page for all that is Everquest. Not the most inclusive or best site
    available, but very nice just the same. Great Flash or text versions available and the
    news is straight from the horses mouth. You can also get that great poster and box art for
    your desktop wallpaper in their <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_downloads.html" target="_top">download section</a>.</p>
    <p>The redesign makes the site much more accessible and easier to use, especially in the
    text version. The Flash section is definitely full of more eye candy, but after the first
    couple of times the text version serves me better for speed and efficiency. One not that
    really bothers me is DUMP THAT TOP SONY STATION FRAME!! Please. The first thing I do when
    I enter their site is to right click inside the Everquest information frame and choose
    &quot;Open Frame in New Window&quot; from Internet Explorer options. I understand the
    value of branding and advertising, but there could be better ways to do it rather than
    annoy us with an out of place, off color-scheme, top frame that is not what we wanted when
    we came here. That top frame should only be viewed by people entering through the maze
    that is the Station. Hey we all have our own opinions. Taking nothing away from the
    Station of course, I am still a Jeopardy player too.</p>
    <p><a name="EverCrest" href="http://eq.stratics.com/evercrest/" target="_top"><font size="2">EverCrest</font></a>:<br>
    Daily EverQuest comic Monday-Friday. Truly and EverQuest addict stop. There is really not
    much to say. If you like EverQuest and you have a sense of humor, which I find many people
    do not surprisingly, you will like this site. Just go take a look and judge for yourself.</p>
    <p><a name="EQEnchanters" target="_top" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com"><font size="2">Caster's
    Realm</font></a>:<br>
    This used to be EQ Enchanters and was a great site for enchanters and jewelry information!
    Now they have added the rest of the pure casters to their entourage and expanded. Some
    information is incomplete, like most web sites, but they do a very good job. An
    exceptional bonus is their wisdom and intelligence based mana calculators to see
    comparisons of what a wisdom or intelligence enhancing item really gives you in mana
    depending on your level. Great job!</p>
    <p><font size="2"><a name="EnchantersDiscuss" href="http://jdifran.ne.mediaone.net/enchanters" target="_top">Everquest Enchanter's
    Discussion</a>:</font><br>
    Another great place for enchanter discussions. It seems that recently many of the key
    people and posters have jumped ship and left <a name="Words of Enchanment">Words of
    Enchantment</a> for this site. As things progress we will let you know which one stays the
    best resource for an enchanters message board.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><a name="Mythiran" href="http://mythiran.everquest.gamestats.com" target="_top">Mythiran Tower</a>:</font><br>
    Spell Research. The magic users research tower. I have had 2 full fledged caster types
    tell me this is the absolute best web site related to magic research information. Ligge
    has to trust that as the only thing I research is the bottom of the brew machine. Research
    is such a necessary item for those finger waving types that a site like this is essential
    to their progress.</p>
    <p>As we have been working more and more on areas of our site I find myself going back
    here more often. Ligge's alter ego is a gnomish Necromancer and could not have lived with
    out their help. Makes sense for a necro chasing druid to be a necro in his off hours
    doesn't it? Battling necros daily I had a great insight into the class beforehand and have
    had a blast! Thank you Mythiran for some great information.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><a name="EQDruids" target="_top" href="http://www.eqdruids.com">EQ
    Druids</a>:<br>
    </font>This site just did a major facelift and added a huge amount of information. If you
    are a druid this is the spot to go look first. Between their various sections they cover
    pretty much all a druid would want to know, however Twylight and I disagree on quite a few
    things philosophically. That is probably a good thing. this way, between my articles and
    theirs you will see many different perspectives on things. Then you decide what kind of
    druid you want to be. Shame on you Twylight for hunting animals, even for pelts. =)</p>
    <p><font size="2"><a name="DruidsGrove" href="http://206.86.100.18:8080/BBSMessageBoard.showBoard?boardName=thedruidsgrove" target="_top">Druid's Grove</a>:<br>
    </font>Druid one stop message board stop. Not only is it actually pretty darn good and
    informative, its also the only one I can find. Besides being full of knowlegdeable druids
    I have to say without a doubt the best looking message board web page I have seen in a
    long time. Keep up the good work please! If anyone knows of a decent listserv that is
    Druid related; plus fairly active and not filled with powergamers, animal killers, and
    other blasphemers *smile* please let me know. Thanks! <a href="mailto:ligge@eqguide.com">Ligge</a></p>
    <p><font size="2"><a name="EQ Trade Guide" href="http://tradecouncil.eqrealms.com/trade/">EQ
    Trade Guide</a>:<br>
    </font>A newer addition to the EQ web pages. This covers all trade skills and is just
    getting better. Check it out and help him keep his information updated. They are a regular
    poster on the brewers list serv and not only has a good information on the web site, but
    is a nice person to boot. What a bonus.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><a name="Rangers Glade" href="http://www.therg.com">Rangers Glade</a>:<br>
    </font>Having been a ranger at one point in my career, and still when I need a hack slash
    afternoon, this is the best site I ever found dedictaed specifically to this class. Looks
    great and has the information to go with the look. If you are looking for information on
    skills, trades, races, or even quests for yoru ranger look no further.</td>
