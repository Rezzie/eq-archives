      <p align="center">can the average player do this?</p>
    <p align="left"></p>
      <p align="left">Ok, this is my single biggest complaint concerning the
      world of Norrath. Sitting idle for many hours HOPING that the right
      creature will show up and have the right item you need. It is easy to
      criticize and not offer up other options and that is one reason I have
      held off on this article for so long. I don't have that many other
      suggestions, but I do know Verant had an opportunity with the recent
      implementation of new quests to do something nice and chose not to in many
      cases. And of course I do have one idea...</p>
      <p align="left">Let's start with the current thorn in my side. Paw of
      Oppallo. Let me say this before I get the flames for this being a personal
      issue. I would love this item. Do I really need it? No. Will I continue to
      hunt for it, probably not for a while or at least I will not camp for it.
      However, in all fairness to Verant I tried to get this item to have some
      real numbers to show for my article. I truly believe this is one of the worst
      camping items in Norrath. Without getting into the storyline the short end
      of the issue is you need 4 rings from different areas. 2 of the rings are
      pretty simple to come by, 2 are big problems.
      Those are the gold and platinum ring. One comes from Befallen and the
      other comes from Kerra Ridge or Befallen. I spent 6 hours getting the Befallen one on
      3 different trips. I am obviously not a newbie and I have some ideas on
      how to increase spawn rates and in 6 hours I saw the carrier one time.
      Thankfully he had the ring. Now we go off to Kerra Ridge...</p>
      <p align="left">So far I have killed about 230 Kerrans while sitting for
      this final ring. Keep in mind everything is green. I only hunt the ones
      right around the throne to keep the healers dead and to alleviate boredom.
      Sometimes I would walk out in the center of their camps and cast
      Earthquake just for fun, but after a while that wasn't even enjoyable. I
      am hunting Mitty, the Kerran High Priestess. Mitty shows up every 18-22
      minutes. I have killed her 46 times. Do the math, that is 15+ hours. She
      has never given up her gold ring. I have questioned others that have
      showed up on their experiences and have met people that claim to have
      killed 100's of Mittys. People are prone to exaggeration, but one guy I
      trust very well says he got his on number 87. NUMBER 87! My god that is 29
      hours! I have another friend that camped Jboots and I know she got hers
      around hour 33 back when it was the Najena camp. Which makes Mitty much
      worse. Why? Well Mitty is only 1 item of 5 needed, Jboots are 1 of 1. At
      least when you get the boots you know you are done. When I got my ring in
      Befallen I didn't know whether to cheer or cry. I knew what was left to
      do.</p>
      <p align="left">For the last 4-5 days Mitty has been camped virtually
      around the clock. No ring. Mainly by a group of friends and others like
      myself that have met these guys and gals. When one leaves they tell the
      others to come take the spot if someone else, like myself, hasn't arrived
      to get in line. Everyone is very nice, but what is worse 90% are red to me
      at 34. Red?? That means this is even more boring for them. At least if I
      want to play earthquake nuker I can add a degree of risk to my camping.
      Try taking on 5-6 healers, or more, at once and you will see, I don't care
      how green they are it can be very entertaining. I won't admit this
      publicly but I even had to zone once because I was losing. It was rather
      funny. They all ran off at 10% health and me out of mana, they came back
      moments later pissed at full health and well... me out of mana.</p>
      <p align="left">Should this be fixed? Probably not. It is argubly the best druid
      shield in Norrath. It should be hard to get. One thing that gripes me
      though, and this is seen concerning other items too, is an item of this
      caliber which really should only be held by higher level characters is
      available from a bunch of greenies. At least when I have to camp something
      I should get experience for my time. Camping Splitpaw, way back when, for Rune Totem
      Staves and Snakeskin we were getting experience and acquiring items
      appropriate for our level. Same with the doing the Rivervale Squad Ring
      quest. Now we have an obvious high level item, go see who camps it some
      day - average level is 35+, held by a bunch of green trash. If I had acquired
      even a bubble of experience in those 11 hours it would seem more
      plausible. Of course if Verant sees the logic in this and tweaks or moves
      it I will have just pissed off a ton of people, but damn it I am right.
      This is just silly. It should be hard to get, but not because of frequency
      of the drop. Maybe require all 4 pieces to be found and enchanted by 4
      different factions and make them nodrop after they are enchanted. This
      would make the rings easier to get but require you to be honorable to get
      the enchantments completed. This may require you to go hunt somewhere for
      experience and faction, or run other quests. At least, in my eyes, that is
      a whole lot more enjoyable and challenging than killing the same thing for
      30 hours and never getting anything for your time.</p>
      <p align="left">Is the Paw an exception to an otherwise reasonable world?
      Not on your life! How about the Ancient Croc? I was in Guk the other day
      and the camper there was sending love letters in shout to Aradune. She was
      sure this was payback for turning him down for dates in when they were
      younger. She and her partner had been there 11 hours clearing the room and
      never saw the croc in question. Her mental stability was definitely in
      question. My partner is dying for gator stuff and after she heard the
      campers lunacy immediately said &quot;this is not worth it, let's
      go&quot;.</p>
      <p align="left">Bilge in Dagnors. He has me for 30 hours. Nothing, but
      green crap there either.</p>
      <p align="left">Druid quests. I can't even write this without
      laughing. Concerning what we know so far... let me be blunt... these suck.
      Both new weapon quests require 2 drops from rare spawns. I have spent MANY
      lives in the areas that these things spawn. I have never seen any of them.
      Keep in mind I am not the average player. I have a nice network of friends
      and 8 lives in Norrath. I spend as much time there as I do in the real
      world. Not only that but the weapons are horrible. Verant says we are
      casters at higher levels yet they give us new weapons with no wisdom
      bonuses and are difficult to acquire. Rumor has it that you might be able
      to trade these weapons in for a better on... I have seen nothing so far to
      indicate this though. And where is the druid armor? Most druids I know are
      not interested in some super special tunic we just want to look like we
      are older and not like we are still level 1 with full patchwork.</p>
      <p align="left">I am well aware of the quest problems with other classes,
      but as primarily a druid I am not going to get into those. However, as a
      druid I have almost completed about 12 of the new armor quests for other
      classes and really have no
      hopes of completing mine. Even with the changes in the quests recently
      most items for other quests, but ours, are easy to get. I can't tell you
      how many quest items I have let rot on corpses and have still never seen
      any of the things that carry ours.</p>
      <p align="left">Another problem I see with these new quests is that the
      young ones can get the items. I do not agree with a level requirement on
      these &quot;camp here&quot; or trade able / purchasable items, but I also am
      tired of being offered money to &quot;help&quot; kill Meldrath for a low
      level ranger. I mean really, how is he going to &quot;help&quot; in the
      battle. Twinking is going to happen, wealthy players are going to get nice
      stuff at an early age, however... there is a way to make a change.</p>
      <p align="left">When you begin your character you are given a note. This
      note goes to your guildmaster and in return you get a nodrop tunic or
      robe. How about adding this feature in at high levels? Say at 35, 40, 45,
      50. You level and go see your trainer and he says &quot;Congrats Ligge!
      You have reached a milestone in your training! Please take this voucher
      and turn it in for a new Guardians of the Vale item.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">On this voucher list the NPC and the item associated with
      the NPC. By turning in the voucher to the specific NPC you get his item.
      Voucher and item should be nodrop. No twinking, no selling, no bullshit.
      You have earned the right as a halfling druid upon reaching level 35 to
      wear a cool cowboy hat or get a shovel that is worth wielding. The other
      side of this is not everyone will look the same. I suggest we have 4
      levels you get this voucher. Create 6 items. A level 50 druid can never
      have anymore than 4 of the special items and no one but the druid that
      made the levels can be wearing or using them. Of course, I think this
      should be done for all classes not just druids. This adds variety. This
      adds new looks for high levels. This adds worthwhile goals. This eliminates twinking of these items.
      Its almost like a merit badge. People will look at you and know you earned
      it. People see my Testament and know I got lucky.</p>
      <p align="left">Let's take a quick look at Little Johnny again, he is the
      high school or college student with a job and some resemblance of a social
      life before EQ that I have used for other examples. I highly doubt LJ is
      ever going to get many of the nice items in the game due to the time
      restraints on camping unless he buys them. What 4 hour a day player is
      going to want to spend 11-50 hours camping for something that they may not
      get? And who has that sort of time?</p>
      <p align="left">However, with my voucher idea they don't need to camp.
      They can go group and hunt and have fun meeting new friends. Knowing that
      at level 35 they have a number of items to choose from that will
      supplement their existing items as well as reward them for making it so
      far.</p>
      <p align="left">Brad made a comment a while back about putting the
      &quot;Quest back in EverQUEST&quot;. I am still waiting. They definitely
      found a way to put the camp in fully. I can't criticize him entirely he
      has done a good job with a hard to please community and I have heard
      the argument that pages like mine take the quest out of the world. I
      disagree. If you think I am wrong walk into any busy zone and ask one of
      these questions:</p>
      <p align="left">1. &quot;Who do I need to kill to get the Testament of
      Vanear?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">2. &quot;Where is the Water Crystal Staff located?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">3. &quot;How can I raise my faction in Rivervale for the
      Squad Ring?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">You will get a correct answer to at least 1 of not all of
      those questions in no less than 2 zones. Norrath is about a community.
      Norrath is about cooperation. No web page required.</p>
      <p align="left">Now we just need to find some quests... Brad says there
      are some we have missed. True quests. Brad also said 4+ months before
      Fiery Avenger was in the game that it was and we just hadn't found it. Possible issues I still see are the
      pictographs all over Norrath, the buried cities that have pieces
      protruding from the ground, and druid rings not in use. The sphinx. I
      still have hopes there are some true puzzles out there, but having been
      the blunt of so many broken quests in the past I am not likely to go try
      these anytime soon. Until then I guess I will just go camp.</p>
      <p align="left">What's maybe even more disturbing to me is I know a druid
      that camped for something like 24 hours and got no gold ring. He
      petitioned and spoke with a GM for a while and the GM handed him the ring.
      What's the real pisser here is had 3 rubies and a werewolf talon swallowed
      when trying to get the crafted bp from Ulan. What's my GM do about it?
      NOTHING. He doesn't check the logs, he doesn't care about my satisfaction
      or bug, he gives the same items to Ulan and it works for him so I must be
      a liar. Now that's good service!</p>
