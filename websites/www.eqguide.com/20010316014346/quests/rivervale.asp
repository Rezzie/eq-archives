    <p align="left">This is my hometown and I feel like I know the stories behind the
    happenings in and around our beloved town as well as anyone. There is only 1
    quest I
    have not personally confirmed here, Shakey's Head repair. Soon enough... I need to get a
    little more experience under my belt first and been really busy trying to do quests in
    other areas.</p>

    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>Reebo Leefsway of the
    Rivervale Stormreapers is tired of Nillipuss, an annoying little brownie, and his thievery.
    You can be enlisted to retrieve the stolen jum jum by catching the little pest. Nilli can
    have absolutely nothing or several plat, miscellaneous gems and trinkets, and hopefully
    some jum jum. It does require 4 jum jum from Nilli before you bother turning any in to
    Reebo in the druids area. A disadvantage is that means lots of competition from other
    Nilli slayers and even after 4 stolen jum jum stalks little Reebo may stiff you on the
    item. For me half the pleasure is watching Nilli die. Faction gets worse with someone
    called Timmermain Darkbrow who I have never seen or heard of other than from Nilli, but I
    have avoided the brownie camps in Lesser Faydark for a long time. Faction improves with
    all the important people in Rivervale. Nillipuss has also become a very rare
    spawn, used to be easy to find and kill, but now days its near impossible to
    find him. Guess Verant decided we had all camped him long enough.</p>

    Tagglefoot, he is in need of a volunteer to be a delivery boy. He will provide you with
    the case of Jum Jum juice you need. Due to the traveling involved or just lack of
    knowledge this item is also found on the ground or being given away for free by
    auctioneers or shouters. I have also received some from creatures in Misty Thicket. Mainly
    bixies I believe. However, I can not confirm whether these cases behave the same way as
    the one from druid. The case goes to Xanuusu in North Karanas. He is a large treant along
    the eastern side of North Karanas. It has been found most effective to get above his chest
    level before trading. Use levitate and one of the ridges around him to make the jump and
    trade in midair, I have found 2 places to make this elevated position possible. Last ime I
    tried he would not take the case from me. I have completed this successfully many times
    before.</p>

    <span class="qinfo">Items Needed:</span> Deathfist Slashed Belts, Runnyeye Beads<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Items Rewarded:</span> Squad Ring<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Class/Race:</span> all, extremely faction based<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Confirmed:</span> Yes</p>
    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments:</span> If there ever was a
    place to show the importance of improving faction this is the one. Most evil races and
    classes already understand the importance of faction or they don't live very long in
    Norrath, but for good races it is mostly taken for granted as we can easily move around
    most of Norrath without hassles. This quest has EVERYTHING to do with faction. If Marshall
    Ghobber loves you and your good work for the town of Rivervale you become an honorary
    member of the Wall and get the highly sought squad ring. The squad ring provides one cast
    of healing per charge, one charge stored at a time. That's 80 hps in one shot, on the run
    or standing!</p>
    <p align="left">Things are a little hazy on requirements, but having the ring I can tell
    you what I believe to be the most correct information I have heard and seen: It takes 1250
    faction points to receive ring, Mooto (caster goblin) is worth 20 pts, Runnyeye Beads
    turned into Sheriff Roglio are worth one point each and he gives exps, minor items, and
    coins for about every 4th bead - these can be found in Misty Thicket and believe it or not
    Butcherblock Mountains - it seems Runnyeye is expanding their forces; Deathfist Slashed
    Belts are 5pts and can be found in off the Orcs in Misty Thicket and West Commons - these
    go to Deputy Budo by the Wall in Misty Thicket, he gives exps, and minor items on each
    belt. Some say that minos and other Gorge creatures also improve faction towards ring. I
    don't know if I believe this one. Bottomline is if the Guardians of the Vale love you you
    are in!</p>
    <p align="left">If you believe you have earned the faction, it's a lot of hunting, go see
    the Marshall and ask him &quot;Am I one with the Wall?&quot; He will tell you to keep
    working or give you the ring. IMPORTANT NOTE: I have seen people say &quot;am I one with
    the wall?&quot; and get turned down, but after I then ask them to to retry as &quot;Am I
    one with the Wall?&quot; they get ring. So try the case sensitive issue. I have reported
    this, but just in case its still an issue. After you use the ring it needs to be recharged
    by Hendi Mrubble in the Rivervale cleric's guild. Just give it to her and she gives it
    back. If she doesn't give it back and you truly earned it go ask the Marshall again and he
    will replace it.</p>
    <p align="left">On a personal note this ring is the best quest in the game as far as I am
    concerned. It saves my tiny fleeing arse daily by giving me enough hps to run when they
    beat me down to a slow speed or enough to stay and finish many a battle. For many classes
    this will not be as much a benefit due to recharge issues. A warrior that lives in
    Permafrost will have a long walk for recharge, however.... a druid that can bind anywhere
    and pop all over Norrath has no problem teleporting to West Commons and running to
    Rivervale, recharging, and gating back where he or she was hunting. I promise you I do
    this in the middle of of many hunting trips. Giving others a chance to rest and take a
    sometimes needed break while you scurry to recharge and be ready for the next battle! Yes,
    this quest takes a long time, but one distinct advantage is as you turn in belts and beads
    you are getting coins, exps, and items along the way - as well as what other loot you get
    from goblins and orcs AND Mooto. So if you like the Rivervale area you might as well hang
    out and clean up for a few levels and get a great ring as a bonus, the creatures you have
    to hunt pay off well enough on their own from levels 5-13 anyway.</p>

    <span class="qinfo">Items Needed:</span> letter from Unar Gnarltrunk<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Items Rewarded:</span> coin, minor items, food items. wisdom potion,
    pine needles, mistletoe, etc<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Class/Race:</span> all<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Confirmed:</span> Yes</p>
      <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>Go see Unar
    Gnarltrunk in the Druid's / Tagglefoot's farm. He will explain about poor forgetful
    obsessed Deputy Hiltop and his Nillipuss chasing. It seems he has damaged some growing jum
    jum and owes a debt to Uner. Go see Deputy Hiltop and give him the letter. He will give
    you a token (and exps) to take back to Unar and he will possibly give you an item with
    exps. This quest can be repeated over and over. Deputy Hiltop is not always available, but
    when he is he tends to be over the bridge past the bag merchants.</p>
      <p align="left">Deputy Hiltop is also a little delusional, he claims to have seen an Ogre
    in the vale. I think he might be smoking a little of that jum jum he finds on Nillipuss if
    you ask me. However, in a past life (beta), I do recall a rather large creature hanging
    around the tower in Misty Thicket, but I haven't seen him since.</p>
    <p align="left">Looks like the quick runs are officially over. The new Deputy that owes
    the debt is now Tegil instead of Hiltop, and he resides in the tunnel to
    Rivervale on the Misty Thicket side.
    Makes this a little less attractive since it requires a zone, but I was getting really
    annoyed with all the spam in druids area anyway as people used to run back and forth 50
    times doing this quest. I am glad it has been changed.</p>

      She also mentions the pouch that the rogue runner dropped when frightened
      by Deputies. This can be found quite often on the floor of the pond. Improves
    faction for rogues in Rivervale and gives you coins.</p>

    his pet beetle Ember are Misty Thicket roamers that are seen here and there walking
    around. Talk to him about his bug collection and he will give you the Bug Collection box.
    Obviously, Ember is not supposed to be one of your specimens. Collect the bugs he asks for
    and combine them into the final item you need to return to Blixxin. He will also speak to
    you about the bugs that flourish in Misty Thicket.</p>
    <p align="left">4 of the 6 items are easy. Getting a Giant Fire Beetle Leg or a Giant
    Scarab Egg Sac is a little trickier. I am only for sure that the Queen Klicknik/Klacknak
    bug in Misty Thicket and Qeynos has these legs, but the maybe off of giant specimens ones
    in Karanas too. The Queens can be &quot;summoned&quot; typically by killing a princess and
    a prince, rumor has it in a specific order. I have found if I run back and forth between
    killing these royal siblings she will appear faster. The Giant Scarab Egg Sac is the other
    one... mainly scarabs just aren't as common as you would like in Misty if you want this
    item and Egg Sacs are less common. Patience is the only issue here. Or travel to other
    lands and find scarabs - try the Deserts of Ro. I found 2 in merchants booths near there.
    Regarding the bracelet; this is a great item for everyone except intelligence based
    casters, even after charges are gone the ac, agility and poison save will be a great help,
    a definite plus for rogues.</p>

    about Shakey and he will get you started. There are 2 problems, he needs more stuffing and
    a <a href="rivervale.asp#Shakey's Stuffing">new head</a>. For the stuffing you need to
    acquire some hay and a flask of Blessed Oil of Life - Go to Qeynos and ask &quot;Who is
    Estle?&quot; to the Temple of Life citizens outside, for me it was Nomsoe Jusagta, he will
    give you a quest involving taking a Blessed Oil of Life to the Brother in West Karanas,
    you can take it to him if you want to support fanatical UFO worshippers and come back to
    get another one for Shakey or just blow off the nutty clerics and swipe the Oil for the
    beloved Stormreapers scarecrow. Next take the hay to a high priest of Cazic-Thule and have
    him bless the hay. His name is Rorar and he is a lizard folk with a pet in Feerott.
    &quot;Hey Mr. Evil mind doing a nice little druid a favor... apparently our scarecrow was
    made by evil folks (think about it - a Cazic-Thule priest and a necromancer are&nbsp;the 2
    people involved you need to see to heal Shakey) and we must have stolen him at some point.
    So would you mind healing him since we have him now?&quot; Something just doesn't seem
    right here. Ask the slimy thing to Bless this hay and he will tell you you need 66g as a
    donation to Cazic and the hay. He returns the Cursed Hay to you. After you have Cursed Hay
    and Blessed Oil of Life they need to be combined in a forge. People say this requires a
    well skilled smith... I trained to 15 in smithing and made mine. I know another that is a
    smith with a skill of around 40 and he made 9 out of 10 with success.</p>
    <p align="left">The hay can be found in the West Karanas on the infested Miller's farm.
    They are hard to find sometimes due to over hunting and the hay remnants have been very
    rare. I have killed 30 without a single bale of hay. The rumor has been that Miller
    &quot;drops&quot; it on his rounds and apparently that is true. Mine was just laying
    around. I have not seen him drop it, but I have only found hay lying in the field, never
    dropped from a corpse.</p>
    <p align="left">This is a really good example of how things in Norrath are entwined and
    well thought out. The Oil is being snagged from an unrelated quest in the Temple of Life,
    if you have faction enough to get it. It is also nodrop no it has to be you or a partner
    that can put it in the forge for you. If you are a bartender you have probably hunted in
    the Temple of Life for the elusive Koalindl fish and have BAD faction with Rodcet Nife and
    his followers. I am a fish away from being KOS there probably and am always searching for
    ways to try and improve that issue. The funniest thing is seeing that faction adjustment
    after killing those suspected alien fish, &quot;RODCET NIFE... is not pleased!&quot; One
    day I will have to bring Rodcet a taste of some broiled koalindl, so he can see what he
    has been missing; its very tasty sauteed in a little jumjum juice with a Honey Jum glaze
    and some Bixie crisps... What upsets me is many of us have bad faction due to hunting
    these fish over and over again when the quest was broken. Verant finally fixes the quest
    and opens the doors to cheaters and mulers, but offers those of us with bad faction due to
    a BROKEN quest no way to reasonably repair it.</p>
    <p align="left">However, this is also a really good example of how many quests are not
    thought out well. This quest is not for lower levels and the reward is crap! I can hear
    the screams now... lets look at things from a damage perspective. It is about the worst
    magical weapon druids have available to them. The Rune Totem Staff which can be aquired or
    purchased for a lot less and a lot earlier is even better. Ok so it casts summon food... I
    am sorry, but was this a joke? By the time a druid uses this they forage so easily they
    don't even need the Summon Food and Water spells they got at 14th. And for stats.. +1
    stamina and strength (why even bother) and +3 wisdom. Ok, that is the only thing that even
    makes this valid for a choice of weapon and its not worth it. Good points? Looks very
    cool, does add wisdom... weights not bad for 2h weapon. Is it worth it to go get this as
    your new weapon upgrade? No. Is it worth it just to say you did it and have it. Sure. On
    my first attempt I succeeded on all steps and received the Belt of the River.</p>

    about Shakey and he will get you started. There are 2 problems, he needs <a name="more stuffing">more stuffing</a> and a new head. For the head you need to research
    the creation so they can heal him. Supposedly a Erudite holds the clue. There is a book on
    the subject that we druids have on it, but some pages are missing. The pages cost you 20
    gold from an Erudite that is on the top floor of the library and they will lead you to
    Mistmoore to find the person you made the first animated scarecrow. With my luck its
    Mayong's concubine. Here we go again.... have you been to Mistmoore yet? Well, get ready.
    Make sure that he knows you have already had dinner with a High Priest of Cazic-Thule so
    you weren't very scared when someone told you that he was the Vampire Lord of Mistmoore
    and past his 50th season... &quot;Wanna go have a drink Mr. Lord Mayong Mistmore, Sir. It
    really wasnt anything personal when I killed all those bats, I guy has to levitate you
    know. Oh, and the werewolves? They're like pets to you? Oh ummm well I didn't really think
    you would mind, they seemed to be strays...&quot; I will accept any input on this as it
    will be sometime until I am sharing a drink, or myself, with Mayong.</p>

    It is not a good idea to hurt Mangler is you are interested in the squad rings and other

    Rivervale and leave him behind when you leave town. As your pet he can't be harmed so no
    one can kill him and hurt your faction for casting, however when he turns on you recast or
    leave town before someone else kills him to avoid the faction hit for the charm. The money
    goes back to Ace if you find it in Kevlin's shop.</p>

    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>Talk to Rueppy
    Kutpurse and offer to get her something to drink, she likes short beer. Unfortunately,
    Rivervale doesn't sell these so you need to go get one from Freeport or ask a local brewer
    like Ligge if he has one in the bank or the ingredients to make one real fast. She likes
    it, but really likes Blackburrow Stout. The problem is it needs to be smuggled in due to
    it being illegal pretty much anywhere. You will need to go see Gunrich, one of Norrath's
    known smuggler's, and tell him that &quot;Dark Rivers Flow East&quot;. Gunrich runs
    through Misty Thicket from Runnyeye across towards guards at gate. It is bad to kill him
    as he seems to be liked by the guards, they are probably heavy drinkers. He has a case of
    stout he will give you if he believes you and you can take it back to Rueppy for some coin
    and experience. I am having a hard time getting it from him due to faction, but have
    interviewed 3 rogues to confirm the reward. All 3 only got coins, but it is a very easy
    quest. If anyone knows an easy way to get faction up with the rogue class in Rivervale and
    not ruin it with druids, Wall Squad and Leatherfoot Raiders I would appreciate it.
    *Actually if you have Kizzie Mintopp make Honeyjum it will improve faction with
    Deeppockets. However due to the honeycombs and bixies being hunted to extinction for other
    quests these are harder to come by right now.</p>
    <p align="left">I have no idea if any blackburrow stout will do. If it will it also comes
    from a bar in Highhold pass and from gnolls in, well of course, Blackburrow. On the
    smuggling note... this is a large operation and definitely requires some investigation.
    Gnasher from Qeynos Hills fame is also a smuggler and as a Surefall Glade ranger you are
    sent after him. As a brewer (smuggling is ok), druid (friend to ranger), and a Rivervale
    citizen (friend to Gunrich and looks the other way on smuggling) it has been a hard
    decision as to whether I should allow Gnasher and Gunrich to continue and to allow the
    Blackburrow community to prosper. There could be money in this for a brewer down the
    road... I have stayed away from slaughtering to many of Blackburrows citizens and have
    decided to let the smuggling continue. I have even let Gnasher pass by unharmed a few
    times. Please don't tell the rangers.</p>

    This can be done in any order, but for the full &quot;story&quot; you need to start with
    Jooglor Lil Honeybugger in SE Misty Thicket. Joogl has hurt his hand and he needs a
    bandage. Unless you are just beginning and have no money everyone should have bandages on
    them at all times anyway, but that's another discussion. If you give him a bandage he will
    tell you the best way to get honeycombs.</p>
    <p align="left">His sister Lil will tell you that Joogl collects the honeycombs for Honey
    Jum which is very good on Bixie Crisps. Joogl works for Kizzie Mintopp who makes the Honey
    Jum. Kizzie is back in Rivervale and will make Honey Jum for the cost of 3 honeycombs and
    now 30 gold. It was raised recently from 5g. Honey Jum is needed for other things.
    One issue being it is the only way I know of to get faction raises with
    Rivervale clerics, PriestofMischief.</p>

    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>This quest is popping
    up all over right now and I have seen a bard carrier in a few zones. When I was recruited
    it was by Silna Songsmith. She needs some mail to be delivered to the Bard's Guild and
    even gives you a choice of which one you want to go to. I chose Freeport and had to see
    Felisty Starbright. She also offers for you to take more letters by talking to another
    bard member in her guild. The way this one is being spread out all over leads me to
    believe there is something larger brewing on the horizon. However, one of the bad faction
    hits is with Lord Mayong Mistmoore. While I have no love for the vampire he is someone
    that is involved in my saving <a href="#Shakey's Head">Shakey</a> so I am not going to
    intentionally ruin my reputation with him any further without more information.</p>
