    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>There are 2 Millers,
    Baobob Miller and Chandra Miller that sit near the burning fire outsided Surefall Glade's
    exit. If they are not there they typically return quickly as they do roam occassionally.</p>
    <p align="left">Baobob makes wolf garments and Chandra makes bear garments. If you do not
    have the a good enough reputation they will not do it for you and you need to go work on
    faction with Karanas Residents. I believe my years in Splitpaw probably got me over the
    edge for Chandra's continual refusal to make bear cloaks. Bear stuff is very popular as it
    can be worn by all races and classes.</p>
    <p align="left">Here is the costs for each, but if they won't tell you I wouldn't give
    them the stuff yet. Go work on faction first.</p>

    </center></div><p align="left">Chandra's armor is a great deal, unless you need cold
    protection her cape is better than polar cloak (AC5 Cold Save +15 Weight 3.5).</p>
    <p align="left">The other concern is don't hunt animals in Qeynos Hills unless you want
    Holly or Cros to eat you for dinner. Since I do not hunt any animals anyway I just bought
    my pelts from merchants. Even the high quality pelts can be found at merchants in varous
    Karanas zones. Special bonus for this... first the items are worth more money than they
    cost to make so you may actually make a profit on having the Miller's make stuff and you
    sell it, second you get improved faction with Karanas residents for having them make
    stuff. Technically you could improve your faction enough to get Chandra to make a cloak
    just by making her make other items over and over again. May take many and many, its just
    an observation not a suggestion.</p>

    <span class="qinfo">Items Needed:</span> cards: Library of Erudin, Ebon Lotus, Chrono
    Cyclone, Diamond Vale<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Items Rewarded:</span> coin<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Class/Race:</span> all<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Confirmed:</span> Yes</p>
    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>Guard Cheslin is a
    forgetful fool that keeps dropping his illusion cards. He will be heard mummbling about
    this at times. Many peple find these and have no idea what to do with them. I know, I was
    one of those that carried Library of Erudin around forever with no clues. So you may want
    to ask around and see if anyone will give them to you.</p>
    <p align="left">Either follow Cheslin, starting at the guard tower towards West Karanas,
    around as he drops them or just find the cards and then go find Cheslin. He makes a long
    full circle and ends up back at guard tower. He will give you exps, coin, and send you on
    a second quest to his father, Chesguard, in South Qeynos. He will appreciate your help and
    give you more exps, coin, and a possible item. Dad will tell you to watch out for his son
    so this quest really begins with the father. However, most people seem to overhear Cheslin
    mutter &quot;Did I just drop something?&quot; as he drops cards on his watch, or they find
    the dropped cards and want to know what they are for, so it may start with the father, but
    I do believe most people get introduced to the quest in the Qeynos Hills area rather than
    South Qeynos.</p>
