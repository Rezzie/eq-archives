    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">These spells are listed in order of my preference within each rank.
    Description are my opinions.</p>
    <h3 align="left"><a name="Level 1"><font color="#800000">Level 1</font></a></h3>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Flame Lick</font></u></h5>
    <p>Lowers the AC of your target and does additional damage. Great spell to use to pull a
    critter you want to fight and a necessity for melee druids like myself. Due to low mana
    use I used this one all the way through about my 10th season when it started getting
    resisted quite a bit I dropped it from my memorized list.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Burst of Flame</font></u></h5>
    <p>The first in your line of fire based attack spells. This one is very short lived and
    will find little or no use after you get it upgraded to Burst of Fire, but it is the best
    you have for now. I chose to not even buy this one and melee'd my way on to 5th and the
    better spells, it also taught me to always be concerned with my combat abilities over my
    spell casting to survive as a solo hunter.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Minor Healing</font></u></h5>
    <p>The first heal spell you get and something you will use a lot. The next one doesn't
    arrive until 9th season so learn to love this one for a while. It is also great in later
    years when you are out of mana and poisoned and just need enough healing to outlast the
    poison. This spell can be memorized and mana replenished in seconds.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Skin Like Wood</font></u></h5>
    <p>Armor class and hit points added by the wood skin. Another necessity for those druidic
    types that either solo, tank for groups, or just seem to always be getting hit by
    something. This is the first in a line of spells that just gets better. Skin Like Rock
    comes in 14th season.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Snare</font></u></h5>
      <p>Slows down critters to allow you to regroup yourself or even get away. The true power
    of this spell is not realized for quite a bit, for now you can use it to pull creatures
    slowly towards you while you blast them with Burst of Flame as they proceed. By they time
    they get to you to melee you should have a distinct advantage, if not RUN! They are,
    hopefully, still snared and you can get away before they are free to run if it is needed.
      This is always memorized. I can't stress the usefulness of this spell to
      prevent runners enough. Try places like Paw and Permafrost without it and
      you will be making corpse recoverys.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Panic Animal</font></u></h5>
    <p>Very important for the true non animal killing druids out there. From time to time you
    or your party will be attacked by animals that you do not want to kill. If your party is
    understanding you can panic the animal and everyone head to a zone. This is also great to
    give you or others a chance to get away from an attacking animals in fights you would have
    lost. I have saved many a person and animal by casting panic animal on a Kodiak that was
    killing the hunter. Kodiak runs away, hunter zones, neither had to die after all. There
    are other tricks for this spell later. If you are so inclined you can be necro druid and
    (with a pet preferably) find an animal type target - snare - send pet - swarm - panic -
    meditate. Obviously, as you get older you can replace each of those spells with its
    stronger version.</p>
    <p>Here is a nice later version. Pet a griffawn, find a griffenne, feral pet, snare
    griffenne, send in pet, creeping crud on griffenne, dizzying wind, terrorize
    griffenne,
    meditate. Chances are pet will be dead and griffenne will return. Pet dies. Get up, snare, and either
    blast away or reDOT and terrorize again.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Endure Fire</font></u></h5>
    <p>Adds resistance to fire based attacks. Good spell and low mana use, but I didn't really
    notice the great value until I began fight casting goblins, gnolls, and orcs that all seem
    to like Burst of Fire as their offensive spell of choice. Plus in your later years at
    Lavastorm this helps protect against the fire imps and elementals.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Lull Animal</font></u></h5>
    <p>This spell lowers the aggressiveness of animals. I have never found a use
    for this spell.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Sense Animal</font></u></h5>
    <p>Helps you find animals in your vicinity. Is a great spell for animal killers, but
    essentially worthless for good druids. I have only found this useful when trying to find
    the closest pet possible in an emergency situation, but to use it that way it has to stay
    loaded. Its use is very minimal for any true druid that does not hunt his animal brethren.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Dance Of The Fireflies</font></u></h5>
    <p>Worthless. Save your money and put it towards buying a lightstone if you feel the need
    to have more light. The only use I ever found for this was to increase my casting skill in
    Divination cheaply. Later on I seemed to die more often in really dark places, like the
    bottom of Lake Rathetear, and then having a cast able light source for a corpse retrieval
    mission has it's points. Hopefully by the time it becomes necessary you will have plenty
    of money in the bank anyway, maybe even extra lightstones, but casting and destroying one
    of these to go find your body is no real expense anyway.</p>

    19</a></p>
    <h3><a name="Level 5"><font color="#800000">Level 5</font></a></h3>
    <p>One question you need to ask yourself here is do I hunt more inside or outside? It will
    make a difference on purchases and this is where you abilities begin to divide. Some
    spells can ONLY be used outside: Camouflage, Whirling Wind, Invoke Lightning. Although,
    camouflage can be cast just as you enter an area that is inside and give you a chance to
    peek around unseen...</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Burst of Fire</font></u></h5>
    <p>A great low level direct damage spell. This will be used for many seasons to come. It
    is a wonderfully fair mana and recharge speed spell as well as a great last little
    &quot;umfph&quot; at higher levels to bring down a runner or conserve mana on lesser
    critters that still attack you.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Camouflage</font></u></h5>
    <p>Hide from everyone! This spell can only be cast outdoors, but you can cast it at the
    entrance to an inside zone and remain camo'd until you attack, loot, trade, or it wears
    off. Great idea for runs through Runnyeye or quick peeks at what's inside that new place
    you have never seen before...</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Harmony</font></u></h5>
      <p>This is an outdoor &quot;lull, mez&quot; type spell. It can be cast on a group of
    critters and has an area effect to prevent the group from mobbing you. Once cast, if it
    effects the whole group surrounding your target you can now cast on your target and pull
    just him. Makes a great crowd control tool. You want real crowd control try grouping with
    an Enchanter. Their spells plus your arsenal and you can take on the world.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Whirling Wind</font></u></h5>
    <p>Outdoor only spell! This one does extra damage to winged creatures, bats, griffawns,
    etc.. It also possibly stuns and knocks the target back some. Eventually replaces Burt of
    Fire as your last little &quot;umfph&quot; spell as its mana cost becomes unnoticeable at
    higher levels. Slow recharge is the only problem.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Gate</font></u></h5>
    <p>This spell teleports you back to your homespot. Now that you have camouflage you can
    begin traveling a bit further than you have and this will help you return home when you
    get lost in strange lands. The cost and casting speed prohibits this to be of much use as
    a getaway device until later, but when you get completely turned around in Black Burrow or
    Kithicor it is nice to know home is only a cast away. This spell combined with Bind
    Affinity later even allows you to have a &quot;feigned shadow step&quot; ability later...</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Cure Disease</font></u></h5>
    <p>Pretty obvious use. Rabies, Infectious Cloud, and many more will be cured over your
    lifetime. Especially once you start battling evil necromancers. There are a couple I hunt
    that fire disease cloud as their first shot at me. I keep this spell loaded against them.
    In the beginning this spell won't have to be memorized until needed in most cases.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Cure Poison</font></u></h5>
    <p>Another no brainer. Depending on where you are hunting will define this spells use. If
    you choose to be a great Giant Snake Fang merchant you will cast this quite often. Other
    critters will poison you, but it seemed my days against giant spiders and snakes were the
    only times poisoning became a serious threat.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Grasping Roots</font></u></h5>
      <p>The beginning of our line of root spells. I hate them all. The biggest
      issue is we never get a &quot;root&quot; spell. We get root + damage which
      means the target gets 2 saves. The higher ones can last a nice length of
      time if they stick and that is a big if unfortunately. You are almost
      always better served with the snare line of things.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Invoke Lightning</font></u></h5>
    <p>Outdoor only, area effect. Expensive mana costs. This spell is great at later levels,
    but in my opinion needs to be bought, scribed, and shelved for at least 2 levels before it
    gets an real active use. That way the mana is not as costly. If you or your group want to pull 2 or more critters that are close together it
    does a great job of that. At later levels 14 and up, when soloing or in a group, it is a
    great spell for cleaning out 5-8 skeletons at a time without a ton of mana use. There are
    many places that have upper level gnoll or goblin casters, ghouls and other undead, but
    tend to be guarded or surrounded by a multitude of low levels assistance. These are
    wonderful times for this spell. In my 16-18th seasons this spell got a lot of use.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Ward Summoned</font></u></h5>
    <p>The elemental offensive spells first level. Great for battling elemental beast such as
    fire elementals in Lavastorm Mountains and earth elementals in Steamfont Mountains. Druids
    are the most powerful against these vile disfigured violations of nature.</p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Level 1">Level 1</a> | <a href="#Level 5">Level 5</a> | <a href="#Level 9">Level 9</a> | <a href="#Level 14">Level 14</a> | <a href="#Level 19">Level
    19</a></p>
    <h3><a name="Level 9"><font color="#800000">Level 9</font></a></h3>
    <p>This is a strange mix of choices indeed... it has some of what I think are the best
    druid spells around, it also has a few I feel are absolutely a waste of spellbook space.
    First question. Do you hunt in or around water? If so go buy Enduring Breathe first!! One
    the absolutely best spells you will ever have! If not, the order I have them in below
    should suffice.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Ignite</font></u></h5>
      <p>Ligge's number one used offensive spell at this point. Cost is a little frightening
    at first but mana to damage ratio is good and as it gets less expensive this is
    almost all the arsenal you will need to get through quite a few levels.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Thistlecoat</font></u></h5>
    <p>Adds armor class and very minor damage to anyone that hits. While damage may be minor,
    both this and Shield of Thistles below have a distinct advantage. They are magical
    attacks. Once you have a magic weapon or partners that assist you with your hunts you will
    be doing damage to things like wisps, ghouls, and scarecrows (critters that require a
    magical weapon to hit) as they hit you.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Shield Of Thistles</font></u></h5>
    <p>Same concept as Thistlecoat except a lot stronger assistance and more damage to those
    beating on you. The trade off is time, this only lasts for 18 seconds. Surprisingly enough
    that is a plenty of time. I can take 2 ghouls and have them beating on me while I swing
    and ignite them. The second one will typically fall as the Shield of Thistles wears off.
    This is also something you can use on others in your party, things just get
    better from here.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Light Healing</font></u></h5>
    <p>Umm duh, next spell for healing. A must have for everyone.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Strength Of Earth</font></u></h5>
    <p>An increase in strength is always a bonus. As a short greedy little halfling I tend to
    carry a lot of loot. This helps me keep my encumbrance below 75% to allow for those quick
    getaways when needed. You can never have too many bonuses to strength or agility in my
    book. Also helps with your melee skills.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Enduring Breath</font></u></h5>
    <p>As far as I am concerned this spell is as much of a benefit as Spirit of Wolf is later.
    There are many areas that are water based in Norrath and be able to go underwater without
    having to watch your air is a necessity to survival. There are a number of times I have
    found the only safe place to rest and meditate have been underwater. This spell allows you
    to do that, stamina will be an issue until you get Invigor later, but a quick pop up on
    land will fix your stamina once you have healed and meditated in safely a bit.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Endure Cold</font></u></h5>
    <p>Helps against frost/cold based attacks. In my travels I have not found this to be
    hugely necessary so far. I have spent little or no time up North though. I do use it when
    battling certain casters that I know to cast Frost Rift though.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Firefist</font></u></h5>
      <p>Increases your attack. Nice when you are working on melee skills in a
      group or when you are the tank or soloing.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Invisibility vs. Animals</font></u></h5>
      <p>Hmmm animals love me why would I hide? Actually the usefulness fo this
      spell is much later in life. Sure you can use it in some cases early,
      maybe to meditate in the Karanas and be safe from griffawns and the like,
      but Kedge is the true use. In Kedge you can use this as your invis spell
      to pull and not have to worry if your party all has see invis on.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Starshine</font></u></h5>
    <p>Worthless. By this point you should have a Greater Lightstone or can buy one. Much
    better use for your money. Yes, if you die and need to go get your body and it is dark
    this can be cast and help you retrieve your corpse and the Lightstone on your body... but
    if that is all you are going to use it for just use Dance of the Fireflies if you bought
    that already. If you have as much money as I do and just want to grab it later it can't
    hurt. I still don't own this one.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Treeform</font></u></h5>
      <p>A great spell now. It allows you to rest in piece in wooded areas pretty safely and
    doesn't &quot;poof&quot; off like camo. After the pulled the silly movement mechanism they
    added a regeneration feature which aids in restoring health quickly. For those of you
    whining that you can't walk as a tree anymore.. GET OVER IT. This was not
      Treantform. This also stacks with the Regen series later.</p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Level 1">Level 1</a> | <a href="#Level 5">Level 5</a> | <a href="#Level 9">Level 9</a> | <a href="#Level 14">Level 14</a> | <a href="#Level 19">Level
    19</a></p>
    <h3><a name="Level 14"><font color="#800000">Level 14</font></a></h3>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Spirit of the Wolf (SoW)</font></u></h5>
      <p>Outdoor use only. Both a druid's best friend and worst enemy. Makes you able to out run
    everything I have personally encountered so far. Weight has a direct bearing though so
    keep that in mind my primary concern is always how much my encumbrance is while in
    dangerous areas. I will drop loot to stay light and avoid a death if needed. This is an
    absolute must if you started traveling way back when you got the camouflage spell. If you
    didn't start traveling yet you no longer have any excuses. The other end of it is the huge
    amounts of &quot;Hey man will you SoW me?&quot; ... I am not going to even get into all
    the things that are wrong with that right now... but the spell is one that you will never
    let expire if at all possible from now on. Same rule as camouflage applies for inside
    area: cast at zone entrance and enjoy it while it lasts. This is also the
      first cause for druids to go anon.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Stinging Swarm</font></u></h5>
    <p>Another absolute must have offensive spell. This is a DOT (damage over time) swarm of
    insects you set loose on your target. As you get tougher monsters the melee rounds get
    longer and longer, this will allow you to always be attacking in two forms. It is almost
    always the first thing I lead off with. This is also used in &quot;kiting&quot;. This can
    be a useful tool, unfortunately I see many people that are depending on kiting and in
    doing so training creatures they can not handle to zones and killing other hunters without
    cause. That is not fair to anyone. You can kite responsibly by only kiting what you could
    normally handle anyway. This way you save some downtime in healing and meditating and no
    one gets hurt due to your antics.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Skin Like Rock</font></u></h5>
    <p>Armor class and hit points adjustments. This is the next spell in the line of druid
    defensive skins. A much stronger version than the previous Skin Like Wood.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Bind Affinity</font></u></h5>
    <p>This spell changes your home point or bind point. The place you go when gating or dead.
    You may bind yourself ANYWHERE, combine that with camouflage, SoW, and gate and you are a
    traveling machine! Many others less skilled than you will need binding assistance, you can
    bind others in any city area only. I have never officially charged for binding others,
    however I never turn down donations or tips. This has has ranged from nothing on up to 5pp
    from one kind soul.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Summon Drink</font></u></h5>
    <p>Pretty self explanatory. It creates water for your rations, they &quot;poof&quot; when
    you camp or go linkdead. Best for giving to others that request food and water so you can
    keep your foraged stuff yourself. Plus a nice way to keep yourself in food when you need
    to do a quick corpse retrieval run.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Summon Food</font></u></h5>
    <p>Same thing applies as above with summon drink. If you are getting low on foraged food
    this is a great buffer until you have reforage enough to be safe for a bit. Always stack
    heavy food items or foraged items in the first container boxes so they are eaten first to
    best conserve your weight use.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Befriend Animals</font></u></h5>
      <p>Charm animals to fight on your behalf. See more information <a href="animals.html">here</a>.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">See Invisible</font></u></h5>
    <p>I heard someone the other day say they had never used this spell. For quite a few
    levels we always seemed to be in just a little over are heads at times and were always
    either camo'd or invis'd so as to see your partners it was required to have See Invisible.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Levitate</font></u></h5>
    <p>The closest thing I have found to flying. At this point you are still taking boats and
    they have had a tendency to have docking problems. Problems that make it difficult for
    short folks, like me, to get on the boat. Levitate fixes all of that. It is also helpful
    to get up on things and prevent death if you are walking in areas that are bordered by
    cliffs. I once fell for 10,000 points damage where if I had used levitate I would have
    floated down.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Cascade Of Hail</font></u></h5>
    <p>Outdoor only spell. This is an area &quot;rain&quot; effect spell. It is also fairly
    expensive at this first available stage of the game. Unless you are in a group that is
    strong in its own right, be very careful in the beginning with this one. Wait until it
    doesn't seem to be such a mana drain and stick with Ignite and Invoke Lightning, those
    have just gotten better and more reliable by now.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Expulse Summoned</font></u></h5>
    <p>The next elemental damage spell. Now its a good time to go have a fun time with those
    Lavastorm fire elementals.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Invigor</font></u></h5>
    <p>Ok at first glance I am thinking WASTE of space.. but NO! I have to go running for
    cover in watery depths, I cast enduring breathe and I meditate... all is well, almost full
    mana and hps except stamina is almost 0! The best use I have found so far, may not happen
    often, but I have used it on more than one occasion and you can always swap out as you
    meditate anyway. If in groups and you face long battles it will also be used. I have gone
    to great strides to make sure I stay out of those types a fights, they always seem bad
    luck anyway.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Halo Of Light</font></u></h5>
    <p>The same light source as a Greater Lightstone. A what? A Greater Lightstone. Well, two
    things you should know, #1 you don't need it because you bought a Greater Lightstone about
    8 levels ago and last I checked it never did work right anyway.</p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Level 1">Level 1</a> | <a href="#Level 5">Level 5</a> | <a href="#Level 9">Level 9</a> | <a href="#Level 14">Level 14</a> | <a href="#Level 19">Level
    19</a></p>
    <h3><a name="Level 19">Level 19</a></h3>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Rings Of Karana! also Butcher, Commons, and Tox</font></u></h5>
    <p>Sure buy them all, but no matter what get Ring of Karana first and foremost. I got mine
    about halfway through my 18th season so that regardless of where in Norrath I was I could
    be at my spell vendor seconds after completing the required experience. Karana Ring has
    mostly levels 19 and 24 spells, Butcher Ring carries 39 and 44 level spells, the Ring
    spells are all found in the West Commons druid ring, Circles at Tox.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Careless Lightning</font></u></h5>
    <p>Ignite was just a tease. Now you have some real KABOOM! Fairly tough to get casted in a
    heated battle at first, but great for a lead off or if you have to run and get far enough
    a way to cast a few shots back at your follower. Lots of damage and takes the mana along
    with it. As with all this gets better with age. Indoors or outdoors which is a huge plus
    for a druid! Target only.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Superior Camouflage</font></u></h5>
    <p>Indoor and outdoor use for an old favorite. A great upgrade to one of my favorite and
    almost always memorized spell.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Barbcoat</font></u></h5>
    <p>Additional armor class and a minor bit of damage to your attackers. It's nothing
    amazing, but every bit helps and the AC is definitely a plus.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Shield Of Barbs</font></u></h5>
    <p>&quot;Come on and hit me!&quot; Free damage to your attackers. You don't even have to
    swing, just get hit. In some cases it can make or break a fight. I don't jump on anyone
    that is going to go straight into melee without casting this line of spells first. Plus
    they are magical attacks.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Dizzying Wind</font></u></h5>
    <p>Next version of Whirling Wind, which has now become a minor damage/minor mana spell for
    quick shots, this spell is a powerhouse. Extra damage to winged creatures. This one is
    absolutely made for griff family hunting. This will get used possibly
    forever when outdoors.</p>
    <h5><u>Healing</u></h5>
    <p>The next level of healing spells. Lots better! Same as what the squad ring casts at 80
    hps.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Calm Animal</font></u></h5>
    <p>The next level in lower animal aggression. I have not used it enough to effectively say
    whether it's is worth it yet. I was hoping this would be my answer to ending pet
    relationships, but alas it is not.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Endure Disease</font></u></h5>
    <p>Helps you resist disease. I can't decide whether it is more convenient to cast this and
    hope it helps or cast Cure Disease after the fight is done. So far the healing after the
    fight has worked just fine.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Endure Poison</font></u></h5>
    <p>Same things and feelings apply here as on Endure Disease. I am a lazy defensive buffer.
    If I am not 100% I will need it I don't use it. Of course if I was fighting spiders or
    snakes exclusively I would keep this covering me.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Cancel Magic</font></u></h5>
    <p>Used to cancel an effect cast on you by someone else. If you are rooted, infected with
    a magical damage spell of some sort, etc. I have not had a huge need for this yet. I don't
    really mind be rooted, I am normally committed to most fights enough anyway and most DOT
    spells are disease based I can cure already. Best use is in groups when a member gets
    charmed or to debuff a target you are attacking.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Feral Spirit</font></u></h5>
    <p>What is this? Just what I need! A pissed off griffawn I had befriended and made into
    SUPER PET with this spell and now he wants me... no thanks. There is something wrong with
    a druid that gets assistance from an animal and then has to kill it after it helps.
    However, there is another side of this equation. If you are using animals often you will
    realize that in many cases an animal won't attack something that is too tough
    for it, even
    if you, their master, are being attacked. Using feral spirit seems to make the animal
    aggressive enough that if it was a close call they will overcome their fear and attack.</p>
    <h5><u><font color="#800000">Terrorize Animal</font></u></h5>
    <p>This is basically Fear for animals. An upgrade from the Panic Animal spell. My new
    favorite use is playing a druid necro. I do not like killing animals, but sometimes there
    is just no choice, plus some defined animals in Norrath I still feel are free game. Griffs
    for one. So you can cast snare, swarm, and terrorize and sit down to meditate while the
    creature slowly runs away taking damage. As they flee you can even throw a few blasts of
    lightning, wind, or fire at them for some extra hits. Meditate, repeat. See Panic Animal
    (level 1) for a little more on this subject.</p>
