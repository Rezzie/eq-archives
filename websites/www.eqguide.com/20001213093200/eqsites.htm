      Web Sites Choices</font></p>
    <p align="left">This is not necessarily in any order. There are 100's of
      sites available to Norrathian adventurers on the web and in an effort to
      cut down on the fluff I have listed the sites I currently find most useful
      and why. There are other sites out there and as I find myself using them
    more often they will get posted here and others may be removed. Why list 50
    sites when 6 do the job.</p>
    <p align="left"><a href="http://eqphotos.eqrealms.com/" target="_blank"><font size="2">Everquest
    Player Photos</font></a><font size="2">:<br>
    </font>This site offers no redeming value at all. It is actual player
    pictures of people on each server. Click at your own risk.</p>
      <p><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/" target="_top"><font size="2">AllaKhazam's Magical Realm</font></a>:<br>
 Here is something that Yahoo proved a long time ago..
    you don't have to look good to be useful. Lots of quest information
      provided, I venture to say more than any other site. It is player
      submitted information so I do find some errors from time to time, but it
      is still very useful. Many other topics are covered, most are links to
      other sites that have the information. He also has a nice level chart on
      where is good to hunt based on your level. That's nice when you get bored
      and have run out of ideas on where to take your party tonight.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><a href="http://gamezportal.com/eqr/">Everquest Reference
    Guide</a>:<br>
    </font><b><u>Other equipment sites:</u></b> <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com">Caster's
    Realm</a><br>
    A very nice searchable guide to equipment. This comes to us as a partner of <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq">EQ'Lizer</a>.
    As an all inclusive site EQ'Lizer does a good job and has more pictures of
    items than AllaKhazam's, however AllaKhazam seems to have the most quests
    available. With the inclusion of the item database this definitely is a good
    place to check. The quest database at EQ'Lizer is nice too, however I didn't
    find it any more useful than AllKhazam's &quot;Yahoo&quot; approach.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com">EQMaps</a><br>
    </font><b><u>Other map sites</u></b>: <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com">EQAtlas</a>,
    <a href="http://www.everlore.com">Everlore</a>, <a href="http://users.telepak.net/~rickyh/mapsbyho.htm">Maps
    by Hop</a><font size="2"><br>
    </font>The best place for maps in my opinion. Yes, he did take them from
    everywhere else, but he deserves some credit for getting the best maps all
    in one place. He does give credit for to the creators also and has done a
    service to us by putting them all in one spot. The information provided on
    zone and other such stuff can really be overlooked, I find bad information
    here a lot as every newbie that wants to see their name on the web seems to
    post in each area.</p>
    <p><a target="_top" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com"><font size="2">Caster's
    Realm</font></a>:<br>
    This used to be EQ Enchanters and was a great site for enchanters and jewelry information!
    Baelish keeps adding and expanding, now he even has equipment information. Some
    information is incomplete, like most web sites, but they do a very good job. An
    exceptional bonus is their wisdom and intelligence based mana calculators to see
    comparisons of what a wisdom or intelligence enhancing item really gives you in mana
    depending on your level. Great job! One of the 2-3 sites I will even bother
    looking at the message boards.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.eqvault.net" target="_top"><font size="2">EQVault</font></a>:<br>
    Why bother even reviewing this one.... If you play Everquest you have probably already
    been here. More daily news and information than any other site. They have a wonderful &quot;<a href="http://www.eqvault.com/scan/" target="_top">server status</a>&quot;
    page to allow you to check if EQ is up and well before you even truly
    logging in. Warning this page is very slow when servers are down and we are
    all checking over and over again. The most important asset I feel EQVault brings to the Everquest community is their front page
    news center. They do keep us all up to date on things going on across the
    servers. Even with the nice redesign they still have legacy beta information
    in some areas.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove" target="_top">Druid's
    Grove</a>:<br>
    </font>Druid one stop message board stop. Not only is it actually pretty
    darn good and informative, its also the only one I can find. Besides being
    full of knowledgeable druids I have to say without a doubt the best looking
    message board web page I have seen in a long time. Keep up the good work
    please! As any boards we have a few trolls, but it seems to be kept
    relatively on check. If anyone knows of a decent listserv that is Druid
    related; plus fairly active and not filled with powergamers, whiners,
    flamers, animal killers, and other blasphemers *smile* please let me know.
    Thanks! <a href="mailto:ligge@eqguide.com">Ligge</a> - For a druid specific
    site see <a target="_top" href="http://www.eqdruids.com">EQ

    </font>Well, I have tried to steer away from class specific sites, but this
    one just deserves mentioning anyway. The hunting guide, geared towards
    necros, is still invaluable to other classes.&nbsp; Lots of other good stuff
    here on quests and news. While I don't &quot;necro&quot; it around Norrath
    very much anymore I still check the site from time to time for information
    that helps all my lives out.</p>
