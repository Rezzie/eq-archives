        <p align="left">Changing Tide was formed in the summer of 1999 by a
        group of friends determined to prove there was a better way to do
        things. Most of us had friends in other guilds and standing offers from
        a few of them for membership, but none of them felt like
        &quot;home&quot;. So we made our own.</p>
        <p align="left">Over time we have gone through many of the same pains as
        any other guild has been faced with during their tenure. Memberships ups
        and downs, merges that were unsuccessful, infighting amongst our
        members, faction differences within the guild, drama, drama, and more
        drama. So much that at one point I disbanded the guild and reformed to
        give us a fresh start. All guilds have issues, but all in all ours have
        been pretty mild. Throughout it all a new core of people evolved, some
        of them have been here since the early stages others have strengthened
        us as we grew,&nbsp; and what remains as Changing Tide is a much
        stronger guild than we ever intended.</p>
        <p align="left">Our differences make us stronger and the trials and
        tribulations we have fought through together have made us tighter. This
        family is definitely what I would call home.</p>
        <p align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF" size="5">Code
        of Conduct</font></b></p>
        <p><u><b>Always remember
        the golden rule.</b></u> Odds are good that if you wouldn't like someone
        doing/saying that to you, you shouldn't even be thinking about saying or
        doing it yourself. Plus, you don't know who that person really is at the
        keyboard. I can't stress this enough. I have made some good friends as
        my youngins that have no idea they were talking to me. The reverse is
        also true.<br>
        <br>
        <u>
        <b>
        Guild chat should be rated PG 13.</b></u> What is said in group is at groups
        discretion. There are people of all ages that will be part of our family
        and making someone feel uncomfortable due to language is just not a good
        thing.<br>
        <br>
        <u>
        <b>
        Please no guild bashing on any boards.</b></u> This includes /ooc /shout /say or even in
        /group. If you need to, use our private areas. Everyone needs a place to
        rant. Send me or an officer a tell and whine all you want. However, remember one bad
        incident shouldn't focus blame on a whole guild.<br>
        <br>
        <u>
        <b>
        Guild invites are, by design, reserved for officers.</b></u> Applicants
        should be sponsored by at least one full member. They are then discussed by all
        of us in the private forums. Applicants must be 46+ to apply and require
        at least 10 votes supporting their application. I am sure there are
        younger Norrathians out there that deserve a good home, but we just
        don't provide any activities for the younger age bracket to make a tag
        worth your time.<br>
        <br>
        <b>
        <u>
        Please no power looting or no ninja looting</u>.</b> Everyone in your group
        deserves a fair share. Turn on split, take turns, whatever works best
        for everyone there. Some classes even deserve the cash drops more so due
        to reagent use. Clerics would be a priority here, with enchanters a
        close second in some locations.<br>
        <br>
        <u>
        <b>
        Group loot</b></u> should be awarded to or rolled by the appropriate classes and
        people present that will use them first. Senior officer or group leader
        decides, guild tag has no bearing on the loot distribution. The people
        in the group putting their life on the line get 100% recognition for
        their efforts. We aren't here to feed your twinks. If no one else wants
        something we may roll for twink drops.<br>
        <br>
        <u><b>Open events.</b></u> Most of Changing Tide's events are run openly and
        posted on our boards. Due to the amount of people in our guild and in
        The Folk, our closest ally guild, some of the more popular raids have
        sign ups that begin closes. Once our own membership has had ample time
        to sign up we open up what slots are left for others. The more you raid
        with us the better chance you have on signing up on the raids while they
        are still in the private areas.<br>
        <br>
        <b>
        <u>
        Disputes need to be taken up with an officer</u>.</b> That includes
        internally or with other guilds. How you represent yourself to another
        guild reflect on everyone sharing your tag. No hotheads need apply
        unless you understand you need to let officers handle the conflicts that
        do arise.<br>
        <br>
        <b><u>We are here to help the members of our family</u></b>. We aren't
        here to chastise, ridicule, or embarrass our friends. Sure, we all make
        fun of rangers and druids, but it's hard not to. However, if you feel
        the need to bash your guild members repeatedly just to feel better about
        yourself, please go elsewhere.</p>
        <p><u><b>Learn your class.</b></u> To do things effectively in Norrath with a
        small bunch of people talent is required. Learn your class, ask
        questions, practice, read boards, try new things. If you are interested
        in a guild that will power level you to 60 and get you items on Ebay you
        are on the wrong web page. It takes time to learn your class and have
        the opportunity to be faced with a wide variety of scenarios so when the
        crap hits the fan. There is nothing that can teach you that but time and
        experience.<br>
        <br>
        <u>
        <b>
        You are 100% accountable for anything your character does.</b></u> Anything they
        do is a reflection on us as a whole. This includes shared accounts or
        the sharing of accounts. It happens and that's fine, but please remember
        that if they mess up and give you a bad name and therefore the guild,
        you are the one that faces those consequences.</p>
