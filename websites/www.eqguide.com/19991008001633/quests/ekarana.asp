    <p align="left">So far nothing here that I can unravel that starts here. However, like
    South Karana, a few quests have their action take place here.</p>
    <p align="left"><span class="zone">East Karana<br>
    </span>Quests here that originate elsewhere: <a href="qeynos.asp#The Clothespinners" target="_self">The Clothespinners</a>, Tallus Holton<br>
    Total Quests:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unconfirmed:0<br>
    Best Quest: probably Tallus staff, once we can figure out what it does</p>

    <span class="qinfo">Items Needed:</span> 5 gold<br>
    <span class="qinfo">Items Rewarded:</span> faction and miscellaneous minor item<br>

    <span class="qinfo">Confirmed:</span> Yes</p>
    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments:</span> Sir Morgan and Squire
    Wimbley stand just up the road from the bridge as you enter from North Karana. Sir Morgan
    needs to keep up his armor and would like a donation, for 5 gold he will improve your
    reputation and give you something he has found. Rusty halberds, rawhide, torch, etc. The
    faction improvements are: KaranaResidents, GuardsofQeynos, PriestsofLife, KnightsofThunder.
    I no longer get faction improvements here.. may have changed.</p>
    <p align="left">However in about 100 donations I did get a halfling throwing
    knife, someone else wrote in and they got one also. Nice item (12 dam, 60
    delay, 60 range) and I am only mentioning it as someone else wrote to me
    about it. I had amiable faction with Sir Morgan when I was making donations
    and only got 1 out of 100 times so don't expect it.</p>
