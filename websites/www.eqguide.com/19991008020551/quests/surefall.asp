    that will wait until I bring another adventurer up to the Qeynos area, we do have a ranger
    and a necromancer on board somewhere. Since he looks upon me warmly and seems much
    friendly than Hager... well Hager can just hunt his own poachers.</p>

    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>Talk to Larsk Juton
    in Surefall Glade, he is behind the Rangers guild along the water, he will tell you about
    the smuggling going on and how he needs help to stop the late night meetings. Gnasher
    Furgutt is the local runner that you need to catch to prevent these meetings. He is found
    most commonly near the entrance to Blackburrow in Qeynos Hills. Best Norrath hours 10pm -
    4am, the later it is past midnight the more often I see him in the hills just past the T
    to cottage or Qeynos proper. Kill Gnasher and bring his head to Larsk.</p>
    <p align="left">Gnasher will also carry a letter from time to time and you can also give
    this to Larsk, he does ask you you to tell him anything you find out about this operation.
    Larsk will return the letter to you and have you take it to Captain Tillin in the city of
    Qeynos, he is above the arena area. For this letter the happy Captain will give you the
    Medal of Merit. He will also summon the executioner to go kill carry out the sentence on
    the bartender, McNeal Jocub, you have just ratted on. If you want you can go sit and watch
    Miss Big Blonde Executioner kick old McNeal around.</p>
    <p align="left">This is one of those issues/storylines that actually involves many more
    zones and lives across Norrath than it seems. Information on this smuggling operation can
    be overheard in Rivervale, High Pass, and elsewhere.</p>
      <p align="left">On a new addition, unconfirmed, upon turning in Gnasher's
      head you are now told about a new Jagged Pine Cloak. This requires 3 cases
      of Blackburrow stout from the Blackburrow gnoll brewers. I will be
      checking into it soon.</p>

    fanatical &quot;Don't kill the bears!&quot; crier, seems to also be a master woodworker.
    There is a lost staff somewhere in Qeynos Hills. It is now in 2 pieces, top and bottom,
    and can be found on gnolls (supposedly hunters normally), which unfortunately seem very
    rare and even more rare is when they actually have a piece of the staff.</p>
    <p align="left">If you get the 2 pieces take them to Corun and he will assemble them into
    the Jaggedpine Crook. I nice low level magic staff for those so inclined to 1H blunt
    weapons. Useable by rangers and druids only: 5 dmg, 31 delay 1h blunt +1 str, +5hp, +5
    save versus disease.</p>

    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>Go see Gillarian
    Naelev, first person in rangers guild, and talk to him about poachers. He will explain
    there is a new problem with bear hunters in the Glade and asks for your assistance. The
    poachers can normally be found right behind the waterfall in the cave area. Gillarian
    claims that there are multiple hunters and races, but I have killed 15 or more personally
    to help protect Mammoth and brethren and they have always been human, but 1, he was a
    gnoll poacher. Take the head of the poacher you kill back to Gillarian for coin and exps.</p>

    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments:</span> Merona Castekin hangs
    out in the ranger's guild of Surefall and is upset about her lost brother, Ronn Castekin.
    She will send you to go see Sneed in Qeynos first as he was the last place she knows he
    was seen. Sneed last saw him with a man dress in black and hanging out in the
    Aqua ducts area. He currently roams the catacombs of Qeynos as a skeleton. He is in a weakened state
    and needs to be put out of his misery. Kill him and you will receive a note containing
    more information which you can take to Merona to at least let her know what has become of
    her brother.</p>

    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>See Gerael Woodone
    and he will ask you to deliver a flask to Linaya Sowlin in West Karana. This delivery can
    turn into a secondary quest. Having gained her trust she asks for your help in protecting
    her from unkempt druids. Draze Slashyn, unkempt druid, shows up outside and taunts Linaya.
    Take out the blasphemer and you could get money and/or an item as well as a note that
    Linaya speaks about. Linaya will send you back to Gerael with the information.</p>
    <p align="left">Gerael will reward you for your work and send you to inform Captain Tillin
    in Qeynos, arena area, of the new problem. He gives you the note back to take to Tillin.
    Tillin will send you to warn the ambassador over at the Lion's Head Inn. The ambassador
    was Gash Flockwaller when I went. Tell him &quot;they are trying to kill you&quot;. He
    will tell you about unkempt druids and wood chips. The ambassador will be attacked while
    you are there and the attacker must be killed. I have not been able to confirm anything
    after this as he didn't have any wood chips or significant loot when he died. I have
    checked around and apparently others have had the same result.</p>

    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>See Hager Sureshot
    out at the archery range in Surefall Glade. He will explain about his problems with
    poachers and the protection of Mammoth. The big problem is a poacher by the name of Talym
    Shoontar. Bring him this evil man's head and he will reward you with an item and money.</p>
    <p align="left">I have seen Talym Shoontar roaming 3 different times in Qeynos Hills. As
    he looks upon me warmly I have been hesitant to due him any harm. I have yet to see him
    kill any bears and only have Hagar's word for it so I am probably going to let him live.
    Hagar doesn't even look upon me warmly so Talym has an edge in my book.</p>
    <p align="left">Another hint on Talym's route. Have you ever noticed those oddballs that
    walk around the cottage and tower branch area? Just roaming characters without much to
    say, I have seen a female bard, a couple of dwarves, etc... ummm they are all Talym's
    placeholders it seems. They walk the exact route Talym does when I follow him and chat.</p>
