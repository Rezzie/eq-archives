    <td width="698"><p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/lavastorm.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155">Right smack in the heart of evil central. Your closest
      town is Neriak, to get to the more pleasant areas of Norrath you have to
      run Nektulous Forst, but it is a haven for anyone that likes to find a
      home and hang out a while. You can feasibly live here as long as you
      desire, starting at about 10 in a group and all the way up to 50+ if you
      count the adjacent zones. The best levels for fighting within Lavastorm
      are probably 12-17. The only time you would need to leave would be
      training with a guild master and banking all your platinum. There is a
      gypsy camp that is a little risky for the youngest of Lavastorm hunters
      that you can sell off your looted items as well as buy food, water, and
      bandages to stay stocked as well as get rid of all the copper and silver
      you collect. At the gypsy camp there are many roamers that can catch and
      demolish younger people. You may also sell at the druid circle, its safer
      than the gypsy camp, however you will have to buy random items and resale
      them to convert the copper and silver to gold and platinum easily.</p>
      <p align="left">On to hunting...</p>
      <p align="left">There are 5 exits or zones from within Lavastorm.
      Nektulous Forest, Najena, Solusek A, Nagafen's Lair (SolB), and the Temple
      of<img border="0" src="images/gypsys.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155"> Solusek Ro. Very quickly let's pull Sol A and B out of the mix as safe
      havens. If you are fighting near there and zone most things that might
      possibly be at either zone will kill the typical Lavastorm hunter. So I
      don't advise these as areas to be around. For the younger hunter you have
      Nektulous Forest, Najena, and Temple of Ro to hang out near for a safe
      meditating and healing spot. I do not in any way advocate training zones,
      but to sit and heal near one is always a good idea.</p>
      <p align="left"><u>Nektulous Forest</u><br>
      I suggest a group here and it's easy to find one. Many druids show up here
      at 14 due to the first line of summoned spells they get for some nice
      blasting. Also the Swarm series works well here. There is an open area
      that you can pull to near the tunnel that heads to Nektulous. The only
      downside here is, like the Sol zones, there can be the guardians and
      guards in Nektulous Forest at this zone if you do need a safe exit. So
      beware. The youngest groups can fight in this area too, however things are
      fire resistant so beware what spells and buffs you have ready at all time.<img border="0" src="images/templero.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155"> </p>
      <p align="left"><u>Temple of Solusek Ro</u><br>
      Ok, time to give up a secret. This is the best place in the world to set
      up camp. Goblins are right above Sol B, harmony, lull, pull. They are the
      lower end of Lavastorm hunting. Probably 10-12 in levels. Druid circle is
      close and safe for selling. Back wall near Temple is a flat area to pull
      fire elementals, drakes, basilisks, and crawlers. This is a charm heaven
      for aspiring enchanters. My feeling is if you are an enchanter over 12 and
      still using your animation you are in for a world of hurt as an older
      enchanter. You get charm at 12, learn it, love it, live it. Things go bad
      mez and recon. Is it indifferent again? Go med somewhere. That's the big
      plus here for learning enchanters. Indifferent cons let you check for the
      memblur component of mez easily while you learn your skills. Again, I
      don't advocate zone hugging or running, but the Temple zone is almost
      always empty and the risk of you training anyone is pretty nil. As an
      enchanter I solo'd here very effectively with the occasional colors, root
      or mez trick to get me out of there for a run to zone. This place was a
      great area from 12-17. Nothing to fear inside Temple for resting periods
      if you need to go afk. At the Temple doors, inside Lavastorm, goblins do spawn
      and jump you if you are unaware. So becareful of that issue.</p>
      <p align="left"><u>Najena<br>
      </u>Another good place to set up shop, however there are trains and no
      vendors close. Great scenery and a nice open flat spot to hunt in front of
      the ramp up to Najena.<img border="0" src="images/najena.jpg" align="left" width="206" height="155">
      Same issue applys here as Nektulous area. Beware of zoning as to what may
      be on the other side. The other issue here is there a lot of people
      typically sitting on the outside of Najena resting from a fleeing exit
      from inside. Be nice to your fellow hunters and dont risk their well being
      by being a reckless trainer.</p>
      <p align="left">All in all Lavastorm is one of the best midteen areas to
      fight in my eyes. A decent variety of creatures, stuff that cons
      indifferent so it allows you to roam somewhat freely (watch those fire
      imps and elementals), pretty easy to get one thing at a time, you can hunt
      - loot - sell - shop in the same zone, and IT'S NOT CROWDED! A premier
      place for druids to develop some variety in skills due to the lack of fire
      based spells being used as well as a great place for enchanters to work on
      learning charm tactics. Money isn't too bad either.</p>
      <p align="left">If you are learning the basics of being a Norrathian
      merchant there is an added bonus here. All 3 dungeon zones drop nice items
      and you could possibly buy them for much less here than elsewhere to resale
      yourself elsewhere for a tidy profit. Just an added bonus to a great zone.</p>
