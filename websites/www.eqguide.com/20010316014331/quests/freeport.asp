    quests that originate in the tunnels below Seafarer's Roost. Messages from
    Harkin, Nestral, and Gren are simple deliveries and each one gives you good
    factions with Carson McCabe, both Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Freeport
    Militia, as well as 2 sets of Trade Coalitions. No bad factions.</p>
    <p>Two most important locations... the bank is in North Freeport and the
    docks in East. Judging by the dialogue with Lenka Stoutheart in the
    Seafarer's Roost (dock bar) this will possibly be the dock for the expansion
    pack and the Kunark's Run voyage. Other rumors say the docks in Oasis, but
    if you notice there are multiple dock locations in both Freeport and
    Butcherblock, not 100% sure on the Erudin setup.</p>

      <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>Arghh.
      One of the thorns in my side has been this quest since day 1. It is, after
      all, a brewer's compendium quest and as it was changed from a broken quest
      to a fixed quest it has become less and less a desired item for brewers.
      However it does FINALLY look like a beer mug instead of a lantern. While
      Ligge has no use for this item anymore it is a great thing for
      intelligence based casters. Plus Ligge went and got a Crude Stein (it
      always looked like a mug) for the brewing aspect of things.</p>
      <p align="left">This is one of the few long quests (Robe of Oracles,
      Trueshot Longbow, and Ice Comet all rank up there too) in
      the game and is quite enjoyable regardless of my animosity, however, it
      has been morphed enough it is essentially an enchanter only quest now.</p>
      <p align="left">This starts at Gregor in Freeport, he is located in the
      bar just off the docks. He will speak of his quest for exotic drinks and
      of a wonderful compendium that gives the recipes for these said drinks.
      However, his objective is a recipe he has been working on a while and he
      needs certain hard to come by ingredients. In exchange for these
      ingredients he will give you the sought after book.</p>
      <p align="left">Kiola nut: Nothing to it. Go to the Sister Island in the
      Ocean of Tears. This is the first stop from Freeport and is littered with
      lost of attractive elven women. Evil people beware they will kill you.
      Evil enchanters - jump off as it approaches dock and cast one of your
      illusion elf spells at waters edge or do it on Freeport docks before you
      leave.</p>
      <p align="left">Koalindl fish: This comes from 2 places. Killing
      Frostbite, the barbarian's dog in West Karana, or&nbsp; killing the
      Koalindl fish in the Temple of Life pond in Qeynos. Both are devastating
      faction hits and eem to be unrepairable once you get to a certain status.
      But hey as an enchanter you can typically get around bad factions anyway
      with illusions and the line of &quot;like me more&quot; spells. I have had
      better luck getting the fish from the fish than the dog, however both
      Temple Freaks and Barbarians are no longer friends. NODROP now.</p>
      <p align="left">Honeyjum: 3 honeycombs and 30 gold pieces to Kizzie Mintopp
      in Rivervale. Honeycombs come from bixies or can be bought from new
      halflings hunting the area. This also gives faction adjustments for having
      Kizzie make the Honeyjum. It is one of the few, if not only, place I can
      find to improve PriestofMischief (Rivervale Clerics) faction.</p>
      <p align="left">Erud's Tonic: Go to Hawk's Inn, the bar near the center of
      town in Erudin, and buy an Innoruk's Kiss of Death and take it to Sinnkin
      Highbrow. She is on the top floor of the library. NODROP now.</p>
      <p align="left">My suggestion.. unless you want to spend all day doing
      this do it in stages. My understanding is the fish and tonic are now
      nodrop so go get the nut and stick it in the bank, do the same with the
      honeyjum. Then on another slow day go bother with the fish and tonic. They
      are lightweight items so it wont hurt to even carry these around a while
      if you want. Time allotted for the entire quest is probably 5-10 hours.
      this guesstimate is based on an enchanter only being able to do it, no SoW,
      and camping time for fish and honeycombs. However, seeing that honeyjum
      and nut are not nodrop (this week) you can send a partner to get those
      while you go get the nodrop stuff up in the northern areas.</p>
      <p align="left">Ok you have everything... now go see Gregor. IF your
      Temple and Knights of Thunder faction are whacked BEWARE. The female plate mailed
      paladin bar patron will kill you. Have someone attack gregor and pull him
      out of the bar or use an illusion and benevolence and/or alliance (always
      conning before walking up to) to get past her to Gregor.</p>
      <p align="left">Give the 4 items to Gregor and he will give you the closed
      compendium. It was never closed before, but as he hands it to you it shuts
      and remains locked. Argghhh. Ok quick rant... THIS BITES for those of us
      that did this quest over and over and over again while it was broken to
      get our new brew recipes. However, the Stein is a very nice item it is
      just a major bummer that the quest seemed to have been changed midstream
      and the Halas bar books quest created to furnish the recipes. In this
      druids opinion it was a huge slap in the face for me to have destroyed
      faction to get my new bar recipes and end up with an item that was
      essentially (aside from trade value) worthless to me.</p>
      <p align="left">Now this compendium (nodrop) needs to go to Clurg in Ogguk.
      When we were running this quest we just asked an ogre for a guide or Clurg
      and with my enchanter buddy as an ogre and using benevolence got the stein
      without further hassle. It was very nice to be in an area that sent chills
      down my spine. We both new that if either of our illusions faded (wolf or
      ogre) we were dead meat. what a rush.</p>

      go with the good guys or the bad guys.</p>
      <p align="left">Captain Hazran of the Freeport Militia (bad guys) accept
      the belts and gives you coin and experience as well as messes up your

      <p align="left">Cain Darkmoore resides upstairs in the building next to
      the Arena and also
      takes the belts. Much better factions here, paladins and warriors, and

      Valeron Dushire of the paladin's guild would like to see and end to the
      reign of Sir Lucan, the evil man in charge of the Militia. He used to be a
      worthless street rat and was taken in by the Temple of Marr and the
      paladins and trained to be a superb knight. Eventually the power hunger in
      him swelled and he became what he is today. A menace. He is in the militia
      headquarters and is the integral part of a few evil slanted quests also.

      Theron Rolius of the paladin's guild offers you a chance to assist with
    other duties when he tells you about the problems with the vile Militia
    folks. One of your options is to retrieve a message from a Qeynos courier.
    This courier resides near the water in West Commons. Mojax Hikspin. Tell him you are from
    the Hall of Truth. He will ask for some milk. Give him the milk and he will
      tell you the note is under his bedroll in the Inn. I began to head towards
      the Inn and Duggin Scumper showed up saying he now has the note and begins
      to run away. HE IS FAST! The onlt way I got him was he happened to run
      into a bear that jumped him. I charmed the bear and let him fight it out.
      Knights of Truth and Priests of Marr factions are better and Militia and
      Tradesfolk goes down. This note goes back to Eestyana Naestra. For
      returning the note I got a potion of Marr's Sustenance. No idea what it
      does yet.</p>

      Theron Rolius of the paladin's guild offers you a chance to assist with
    other duties when he tells you about the problems with the vile Militia
    folks. One of your options is to perform fishing duties. This requires
    finding 2 reef shark skins. This used to be easy to do, but in recent times
    I haven't seen a reef shark anywhere. They used to be right under the dock
    at Sister Island in the Ocean of Tears.</p>

      their own guilds pond. These minnows live in the same pond as the piranhas
      do that the Hall of Truth wants eradicated. Hand the &quot;jar of
      liquid&quot; to the minnows and pray they go in. The faction hits are not
      pretty, but I seemed to have found a work around for those that like to
      skirt and fix their faction issues as you go. If you can also work on the <a href="#Eradicate Piranha" target="_self">piranha
      quest</a> at the same time you get offsetting factions hits and bonuses.
      It seemed for every 1 minnow attempt 4 piranha slayings put me back to
      where I was with the paladins. I was never able to get a minnow in the jar
      and made around 10-12 attempts. One person I asked that completed it said
      he got it on his 3rd try and couldn't remember the reward, but it was
      minor.</B></p>

    say clerics specifically, but I was able to do this and I am not. The other
    bonus is you can try doing the <a href="#Marr Minnow" target="_self">Marr

      T'Gaza is located in the underground tunnel system that is off to the
      right of the docks, underwater. Like Harkin's message above this is a
      simple delivery run. You must take a note to Rebby in West Freeport, right
      outside the Theater of Tranquil, and receive Rebby's rat whiskers to take back
      to Nestral. This is a payment on his past due debt. This quest effects the same factions as Harkin's message. A
      great way to repair factions with the more illicit members of Norrath

      see Raltur Calikson of the SK guild and tell him you are there to serve
      Innoruuk. He will have you report to Sir Lucan, leader of the Freeport
      Militia, and tell him you are from the shrine of Innoruuk to assist in
      whatever he needs. It seems the Militia has a working relationship with
      the shadowknights guild. However, as with most &quot;not to be trusted&quot;
      evil groups, he wants you to return whatever you might find to him and not
      Lucan. Lucan is not as fond of the shadowknights and goes on to bad mouth
      them and their lazy attitude and actions. He does send you to find a
      Qeynos messenger and get his note. The messenger is Mojax Hikspin, located
      south of the orc camp closest to Kithicor, he sits in front of the hut at
      the waters edge. This note is also the same note needed for the <a href="#Retrieve a Message" target="_self">Retrieve
      a Message</a> quest from the paladins. So depending on your alignment and
      the brassness of your huevos you have 3 places you can take this note. Sir
      Lucan (militia), Raltur Caliskan (shadowknights), </B> Eestyana Naestra<B>
      (paladins). This roles into other quests - the bad guys will send you to kill
      the traitor identified. I chose not to go this route and turned it into
      the good guys using the <a href="#Monk Sashs" target="_self">Retrieve a

      piece was submitted to us. Apparently giving the note from Mojax to either
      Sir Lucan or Raltor will begin the quest to kill the traitor within the
      militia. The traitor is Guard Alayle. He stands right by the door to the
      militia's backyard area. There are also 2 other guards there. I am
      assuming that if Lucan has told you to kill him that the others will not
      attack. I will get another note from Mojax and deliver them to Lucan and
      Raltor and see what becomes of it. It is easy to guess this will hurt
      Priests and Knights factions, but what does an enchanter really care about
      factions anyway.</p>

    Treton stands below the teleporter as you enter the Arcane Science building
    area in West Freeport. He has been waiting for a delivery for over a month
    from a gnome buddy in Akanon. Lenka Stoutheart was supposed to bring it. If
    you question Lenka you can determine it is shark fodder. Right off the docks
    to the right there is a shark. Underneath this shark is a locked chest. I
    retrieved the chest twice and got nothing more than a &quot;thank you&quot;
    from both Lenka and Nusk. (level 12 at the time so maybe level related).
    There is possibly another chest, a true journal strongbox, out there somewhere. The only other sharks I
    know of are in Erudin area and Ocean of Tears near the Sister Island
    primarily. Or of course its a broken quest... general consensus is the chest
    is the <a href="neriak.asp#Sunken Chest" target="_self">Neriak quest chest</a>
    and the one for Freeport is elsewhere.</p>

      to Toala above the arena and she will send you to find Lenka to help her
      with a lost pouch. Lenka is in Gregor's bar at the docks. She will whine
      about Toala not coming herself and say it was stolen by a rogue from the
      Beast. This pouch contains a voucher ticket for a part Lenka needs to
      finsih repairs on her ship. The Beast is her ship that does &quot;Kunark's
      Run&quot; (expansion pack). This is obviously a reference to the future of
      Norrath as she talks about the dangers of traveling to Firiona Vie, an
      elven outpost there. It will be months until she can take anyone there
      with repairs being needed to the Blue Beast. Hmmm guess we know who drives
      the ship in the expansion pack now... further inquiring between her and
      her partner, Bronto, reveal the silhouette he saw was that of a barbarian
      with long hair and a skirt. Speculation is this is Brunar, the fisherman
      below the docks. Closest match I know of, but I don't know that I would
      have identified his hair as &quot;long&quot; it seems Mr. Ogre Bronto is
      fairly conservative. If you ask Gregor about Brunar and hang out a bit
      there Brunar will bring in a delivery for Gregor. Gregor admits (well
      almost) that Brunar does his thieving for him and he says he will take the
      latest catch to the storeroom. The storeroom is the secret entrance to the
      tunnels so my guess is he is another member of the Carson McCabe smuggling
      ring. Gregor never went downstairs and this ended up being a dead end for
      me.</p>

    wonder what to do with those illegible magic scrolls and cantrips you get
    from ocs? Here are a few things...</p>
    <p align="left">Tara Neklene, from the Arcane Science Building in West
    Freeport wants 2 illegible cantrips. She will give you some faction and a
    possibly a minor item or spell for your work. You do lose faction with the
    necromancers for this one.</p>
      <p align="left">Lozani, Supreme Scribe of the Eldritch Collective, can
      sometimes be found in Seafarer's Roost (Gregor's Bar). He is on a 5 decade
      mission to learn new languages and is currently proficient in the language
      of the Orcs oracles. He can decipher Illegible scrolls for the price of 4
      gold. These are basically shaman spells he says. To decipher Illegible
      cantrips (from orc apprentices) he needs 2 of them, no money required.
      These can be from any form of casters research or even possibly a RECIPE!
      No further clues and no confirmation at this point on what recipes could
      be possible. Coming from a brewing background I have a lot of interest in
      this part, but what a hassle.</p>

      <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>The
      dwarf on the second floor is hungry and would like some muffins. Bring him
      some from from Brownloe's Bakery (this is near the Theater of Tranquility,
      monks area, Rebby and Janam, etc). Raises faction with elven groups of
      Faydwer and hurts Crushbone. While I was there someone said to get Lady
      Shae drunk. This is who Pandos Flintside, the dwarf, is protecting.</p>
      <p align="left">I had white wine on me so I gave her one and she told me
      she preferred red wine but told me about the evil dark elves and some
      wayward halfling that is getting mail from them. The halfling is in room
      number 2 and you need to get the key from the room to get the mail from
      the Innkeeper. However the key seems to be on the floor. I waited a while
      and she didn't leave and I couldn't pick it up,&nbsp; so I killed her. She
      gave me a halfling head and a note. I am unsure where this quest begins
      and am stuck at the moment with those pieces. Beware killing Shintl
      Lowbrew, the halfling, lowers factions with all the people that get raises
      by the &quot;Message to&quot; quests listed above. I have also been
      carrying around a Tierdal head I got way back in the Ocean of Tears. I am
      guessing this is the partner.. but tis just a guess.</p>
      <p align="left">So I gave Lady Shae red wine next...&nbsp;now she talks
      about the deceitful Antonius Bayle. She gave him her heart and he went for
      power, now that he has that he is chasing younger women. After all that he
      asked Shae to hold a list for him. She still had it until a messenger
      showed up to retrieve it for Bayle. Guard Dyllin came and took it. So now
      the Lady Shae has no more ties to Antonius though her heart still grieves
      for his love. She believes Dyllin can be found in Highhold currently. This
      may be a way to get the <a href="qeynos.asp#Bayle List" target="_self">Bayle
      List</a> needed for the paladin's in Qeynos without hunting the sacred
      bear Mammoth. We will look into it. This is also the same guard that has
      the page needed for the Testament of Vaneer quest. A Erudin quest that has
      not been completed yet.</p>

    allies of the shadowknights. Find Groflah, kill him, and return the note. He
    tends to leave his shop in North Freeport and is much easier prey when he
    does. Look for him near the docks and Seafarer's Roost area. Less hassles.
    This will improve things with the bad guys and hurt the good guys, go

      from the Hall of Truth, Merko Quetalis has a small task that needs to be
      completed. He will give you a note to take to Altunic Jartin in East Commons.
      Altunic sends you to help with Squire Narl. You must find the elusive
      Squire and kill him for his thieving ways, he has a very short lifespan.
      Kill him and take his head back to Altunic who then wants a cloth tunic.
      The tunic exchange will get you the first token, the token of generosity.
      Go back to Merko with that and now he will ask for a spider venom sack.
      For returning that you get a token of bravery. Now you are ready for the
      true quest here... give him both tokens back and he will have you take the
      test of truth. Kill a spy down in the tunnels. The guard is militia spy. Kill her
      and take the token she has back to Merko. Now you get the Testimony of Truth
      Scroll. This is a piece of the Soulfire quest below. Beware, you may
      (especially paladins) go straight to KOS with militia after killing this
      spy. Check out the 3 <a href="#Harkin's Message">Message from</a>.. series

      <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>Ok I
      will never have a paladin in my list of lives (nothing personal just not a
      serious melee type too often) so I asked for someone to send me the quest
      if they knew exactly how to do it.. here is what I got (minor edits by
      me). One thing of note, is this guy did not complete the quest. And a few
      pieces are missing, like how to get into see Brother Hayle. Anyone that
      has more information or any corrections to this please let me know. Like I
      said, no paladin in my future and this si an important enough quest it
      needs to be posted. On with what I got -</p>
      <font SIZE="2">
      <p>Ok, this quest is very long and I gotta start somewhere so let me just
      begin.</p>
      <p>Step 1. Before you even learn of the Soulfire talk to Merko in the
      Paladin guild of Freeport. He will tell you that to become a true knight
      you must bring him the tokens of bravery and generosity. The token of
      bravery is received when you give a spider venom sac to Merko. I myself
      had quite a tough time getting one but it should be quite easy to find a
      vendor selling it. Bring him the spider venom sac and he'll give you the
      token of bravery. Now for the token of generosity. Speak with Merko again
      and hell give you a note to bring to Altunic Jartin in the east
      commonlands. Do this and Altunic will tell you of a shadowknight squire
      who has been harassing him for sometime. Squire Narls will then spawn
      outside Altunic's hut. You must kill Squire Narls and bring his head to
      Altunic Jartin.</p>
      <p>NOTE: This is VERY difficult for a low level to do alone. even at level
      5 he was blue to me and seriously ripped me apart. Either wait until level
      10 until you do this or get a group to help.</p>
      <p>Anyways after you bring Altunic Narl's head he will ask you for a Cloth
      Shirt to protect him from any other Evils in the commonlands. Simple. Buy
      him the shirt and bring it to him. You will then receive the Token of
      generosity. Now bring Merko both tokens and he will tell you to venture
      into the sewers (The entrance is right next to him) and face your final
      challenge to become a respected Knight. Inside the sewers there will be a
      Freeport militia guard. You must kill him and bring the final token on its
      corpse to Merko.</p>
      <p>NOTE: Many people may hesitate to attack him. Not a good idea. He'l run
      to the zone and you have to do the whole quest again. either have someone
      that can root or in other words DO NOT HESITATE! Bring Merko the last
      token and he will give you your testimony to Mithaniel Marr. This is the
      1st piece you need to get Soulfire so hold onto it.</p>
      <p>Step 2. This is the Zimel's Blades quest that so many have heard of. To
      receive this quest speak with Kalatrina in the Paladin guild. She will
      give you a note to bring to a paladin spy in the Freeport Militia House.
      You must find your paladin brethren and say &quot;Truth is Good&quot; and
      he will respond. I have forgotten but i think the guard's name is Guard
      Ayalate. I'm not sure but he easy to find. Just run up to every guard in
      the Militia house and say the message. after you find him he'll give you a
      note to bring back to Kalatrina that he found in Sir Lucan's room. It's a
      note that says Zimel's Blades and has some prices scribbled down on it.
      Bring the note to Kalatrina and she'll tell you to go see Rashinda in the
      Office of people about it. Rashinda will tell you about Zimel's Blades and
      what happened to this once grand store. She says that Groflah Steadirt in
      North Freeport knew Zimel so you should go see him about it. Go talk to
      Groflah and give him the Zimel's Blades note. He'll say that he cannot
      speak with you here and meet at the Seafarer's by the docks at night. I
      myself never saw him there and skipped this part. I think it may be broken
      but there is a way around it. If you do meet him he will tell you about
      Zimel and what happened to him and who is behind it all. Also in
      Seafarer's you will see a beggar names Tykar if you wait long enough. Give
      him 4 Drom's Champagnes one at a time and he will tell you that he used to
      be in prison with Zimel underneath the Arena. He will give you a blanket
      to bring to Zimel because he feels sorry for the old guy and wants to give
      it back. Next you must make some Bog Juice using the Brew skill for Zimel.
      this is very easy to do even for people with no skill. Just take a bottle,
      1 snake scale, and 1 flask of water and Tahdah! There's your bog juice.
      Next you need some edible goo which is also fairly easy to make. Just get
      1 fire beetle eye and 1 rat ear and combine in and oven and there it is.
      Now give all this junk to Zimel and he'll give you a key and tell you in
      his own barely understandable speech to bring it to the bank clerk in high
      keep. Now venture forth to Highkeep. Give the key to the bank clerk and
      she'll give you a note and some money. This note must be taken to Brother
      Hayle of Splitpaw. PHEW! step 2 done!</p>
      <p>Step 3. If you thought this was gooing to be an easy quest - guess
      again. This is the Tough part. Give the note to Brother Hayle who is found
      in the Splitpaw gnoll dungeon. He will give you back the note and tell you
      about Soulfire and what became of it. He tells you that it was in order to
      forge it you must bring him the pieces. Now the rest of this is pretty
      straight forward. You have to kill a high level Ogre shadowknight in
      Mistmoore.( sorry I forget his name) this shadow knight carries the hilt
      of Soulfire.</p>
      <p>NOTE: Very high level NPC. he is approximately. in low forties. Next
      and the toughest task of all..... kill Lucan D'leer of the Freeport
      militia. You should come up with a very good team or strategy in order to
      do this or you will be brutally beaten and massacred by the guards. Also
      to add to the fun he has a high level cleric with him who can heal and resurrect
      him. My suggestion is to have wizards that can cast ice comet kill the
      cleric and Lucan d'leer then have a druid teleport you the hell out of
      there. NOTE: Lucan d'leer is even tougher than anything you've faced so
      far and with the other guards helping him it is extremely difficult.
      attempt this if only you are completely ready. For killing Lucan you get
      the Brilliant Blade of Faith...... The Final Part of Soulfire!! OK, now
      bring the brilliant blade of faith, the hilt of Soulfire, your testimony,
      and the note to brother Hayle. He will forge you the ultimate paladin
      weapon, Soulfire. If you can do all of this you are truly worthy of it.  Soulfire (2HS damage 23, delay
      45, +7 str + 7 wis, 5 charges of complete)</p>
