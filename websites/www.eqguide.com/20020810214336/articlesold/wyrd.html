      <p>You are startled from your meditation by a shrouded figure. At first
      you take it to be just another wanderer, roaming the lands of Norrath, but
      you sense something cold... and sad from the figure. From under a hood a
      soft voice speaks. Her words carry a power, and a strange accent, as if
      she is not used to speaking.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ligge, thou art named here. I bring thee a...story.&quot;</p>
      <p>She hands you a bloodied, soiled scroll, and slowly walks away, fading
      into the distance.</p>
      <p>You open the scroll and begin to read the words written within.</p>
      <p>The ranger struggled to stand. Many battles had he seen, and many
      wounds had he received. Blood welled from his lips, and he staggered to
      his knees. His weary legs unable to hold him he fell. Mumbling a few brief
      words to Tunare, he asked for her healing power, but this time it did not
      come. Tunare had forsaken him. Not far away, the enraged Drolvarg fought
      the roots entangling it's feet. Soon it would be free. When that happened
      the ranger knew he was doomed. Off in the distance a small group of mighty
      adventurers watched, and they grinned. They knew that the ranger hurt the
      drolvarg badly, but he was no match for the beast. They saw the ranger
      fall, and readied their weapons. Soon he would be dead, and they could
      finish off the drolvarg, getting an easy kill. Wyrd saw the adventures.
      With his half-elven hearing he heard their plans. Rage filled him! Many
      times he had stood on the line for those who needed help! Risking his own
      life for the safety of others. Many a night He had stood outside of
      Rivervale and, by himself, guarded the town from the army of undead that
      lurked outside it's walls. Yet the craven cowards stood their and waited
      for him to die. Agony filled his face as he stood up. His legs screamed
      and he felt his ribs shift as bone ground upon bone. Leaning upon his bow
      he steadied himself, and drew his swords. Looking up he saw the drolvarg
      break free of the roots, and charge towards him.</p>
      <p>Wyrd lay on the ground, his shattered body was still. All but his hand,
      that fought to grab the hilt of his broadsword. In his last moments his
      thoughts went out to those he knew and loved. Ligge, Splinner, Cailette...
      The faces of friends lost to time crossed before his dimming eyes, Morghan,
      Nitewolf, Arwen and Zeilik.</p>
      <p>&quot;TUNARE!!!&quot; He screamed, &quot;Thou hast forsaken me! I have
      fought for you, strived to preserve your works! Yet the world remains
      unchanged! The same evil walks as it always has, and now at the last you
      desert me! I reject you!!! I reject this world! Let the beggars and
      &quot;l33t d3wds&quot; have it! But this you owe me, This one small act!
      Bring my story to my friends, so that they may know that I died in vain.
      Aye in vain, for this world can not change, and all that I have done was
      for nought!!!&quot;</p>
      <p>The light fades from his eyes, and a barely perceptible whisper passes
      his lips. &quot;good bye my friends...&quot;</p>
      <p>A light summer breeze blows across the plains. In the distance a group
      of mighty adventures gleefully hack to death a badly wounded Drolvarg. A
      hooded figures walks in from the distance to lay a hand on the rangers
      forehead. She is too late, this one has lost his soul, and can not be
      returned to life. She touches his lips with a forefinger, and a scroll
      appears. She looks at it and slowly nods. She knows what she must do, obey
      a rangers dying words.</td>
