        <h4 align="left">November 4, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Well its been 3 months this time... long story short is
        I had major surgery and spent 2 weeks on planet percocet, I got back to
        work in time to see myself and my entire department laid off, thanks to
        some of the great people in my company locally I got a transfer to
        another department a week after my employment ended (less money, more
        work, more hassles), we signed the final papers on my house which should
        be breaking ground this week, Baxz quit, Aaramin quit, others quit
        (*cry* another one that's still unannounced that I am gonna miss more
        than all the rest - *hugs*) Splack started working on a new plan working
        with the rest of us to make it happen... umm PoP came out... after 4
        years Verant decided that a level 5 spell that's been out since beta was
        now too powerful (I would like to take &quot;How to get a clue&quot; for
        1000 Alex)... since then a list of various mobs has been killed... a few
        Klandicars, Zlandicar, Statur, Vindi, Rhags, Lady Len, Servitor, Cazic,
        PoF golems, crap in PoP, crap everywhere else too.. wtf, I don't know,
        ask the guys that have been playing I just get crap when the board isn't
        updated so there - now you know why - I will try and put together
        something new in the future, hell it may even be easier since my time is
        shot for playing half the week, but may be ok for web page stuff... who
        knows... now where did I leave my pipe?</p>
        <p align="left">I am working on a new strip of comments heard in and
        around the guild right now. Hopefully it will be both embarassing and
        revealing to all!</p>

        <p align="left">Well I am happy to report that the new guild direction
        and idea has done wonders for the attitude of most members and has not
        only removed some stress from everyone's live, but has made us stronger.
        Games shouldn't cause stress anyway so it's all good.</p>
        <p align="left">I am also very please to announce that we made our first
        ever trip into NToV and took out our very first dragon from those very
        halls. Many people said we couldn't do it and some people internally
        even believed them. They were all wrong. Thank you to everyone that
        showed up to help and make this the most successful gimp run ever. Also,
        thank you to alll of you that kept telling me to hang in there and keep
        at it because you guys knew better than I did that we were on the right
        track. Congrats to Faeth on a new horn to make the bards jealous and to
        Kreator on the Medal of Deep Thought.</p>
        <p align="left">Admittedly, it was nice for us that most of the big
        names were dead so it gave us a chance to get our bearings and see the
        zone on the way to Lady Nev herself. We know there is a lot more ahead
        of us to conquer, but this was a great start. It is rather amazing how
        well we did on the way back for our first time. We even surprised an
        exCT member that came along for support I think.</p>

        <h4 align="left">June 25, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Holy crap an update? Say it isn't so.<br>
        <br>
        Where to begin... almost 3 months since the last update and we have done and been through a lot. The tyrant guild leader we have got fed up and completely pissed off and decided it was time for a major change.
        Some people left. Some people were kicked out. Some people will be
        kicked out soon. Some were promoted. Some old friends returned. I am
        actually starting to enjoy this world again.</p>
        <p align="left">The <a href="http://pub17.ezboard.com/feqguidefrm10.showMessage?topicID=256.topic" target="_blank"> guidelines have been totally rewritten</a> for members and applicants and along with raising the level to get in we also changed to a more raid focused environment. You know, right click stuff, have resists, have a clue... It's really kind of an odd approach for us considering that a large portion of us wanted to tone down some playing and raiding overall. So what we came up with was sort of a "part time raiding guild" approach.<br>
        <br>
        Once a week we plan one big raid that everyone is expected to attend. Sometimes we have more raids, but its typically pretty obvious which is the mandatory one. This is akin to a weekly poker night. Do what you want during the week - work, experience, play with your kids, hang out with your spouse, go get drunk, keep yourself employed, work on
        trade skills, go make another crappy ass alt - whatever you want to do, I don't much care. However, once a week we have a poker night/day run that everyone is expected to be there and participate. This keep
        burn out down and it helps make people look forward to raids rather than the "oh god do we have to do that again?" problem we were having. Myself, the other officers, and a lot of our friends have no interest in the 24/7 raid lifestyle of some other guilds, but we want to do the bigger things and this approach helps keep us fresh and give us the manpower to do those things when we meet on those specific days.</p>
        <p align="left">In an extra effort to try and regain what CT stood for
        in the beginning and what I still feel we are about now I have returned
        to <a href="http://pub17.ezboard.com/feqguidefrm9" target="_top">hosting
        open raids</a> again. No longer the boring and mundane Hate/Fear type
        stuff that got us started, but <a href="http://pub17.ezboard.com/feqguidefrm9.showMessage?topicID=435.topic" target="_top">Temple
        of Veeshan, Western Wastes</a>, and a new <a href="http://pub17.ezboard.com/feqguidefrm9.showMessage?topicID=436.topic" target="_top">World
        Tour</a> concept I am working on. It should be a fun ride.<br>
        <br>
        Oh well, attention span is probably past by now and I have proven the last few weeks that no one really reads all the crap I write anyway so this is for my own personal enjoyment.
        A few more epics completed, some cool toys here and there. If you want to see what we have been up to

        <p align="left">Yeah yeah I know I have been slacking. I have some where
        around 100 photos on my drive at home to go through and just haven't had
        time. Soon I promise. In the meantime you can see from our<a href="http://www.calsnet.com/changingtide/" target="_blank">
        calendar</a> we have been just busy as hell lately. I know quite a few
        people have hit 60 the last few weeks. Tzhisaz, Kalaelin, Budaas for
        sure. Multiple HoT runs, Dragon Necropolis, Hole, PoG, Trakanon. I will
        try and get those pictures done, but right now crunching experience and
        trying to run some raids when I am able.</p>

        <p align="left">Just a quickie today as we have a new epic ranger. That

        <h4 align="left">April 1, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">No April Fool's jokes today from me. I have seen enough
        already today and I bet you have too. Last couple of weeks have been
        pretty busy and we have started going through some changes to hopefully
        gear us up for the future. I am trying to earn my title and the hatred
        of others as best I can, but for some reason some of them still like me.
        WE roamed around a bunch from Hate, Fear (these places are getting old
        and so are epics!), Maidens, PoA, Grotto, Kael, umm quest stuff, tried
        to do PoG and once again found it empty. Fought with some psycho that
        thinks scheduling a raid on their own board requires the rest of server
        to pay attention and heed their intentions... hell, it wasn't even that
        way when the calendar was around.</p>
        <p align="left">In a move to improve our resources and still keep our
        family atmosphere we have added Forbidden Union as partners for our
        future endeavors. We are glad to have them as part of the nice little
        triad we have created.</p>
        <p align="left">Also as part of the internal changes we have created a
        new position in the guild as more or less a recruiter type role. We
        promoted 6 people to the Application Committee and their job is to
        review and evaluate new guild applicants. During this time we also
        promoted Aamen as an officer and appointed him to lead the first group
        and get it started. Congratulations to Aamen on officer and to Trajan,
        Alinaria, Crylyn, Aaramin, Dingly, and Sakkara on these new roles on the
        committee. Less work for me, more work for them, it's all good.</p>
        <h4 align="left">March 20, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Hey remember me? Well I am mostly back and trying to
        catch up on some things. We have added some new faces to the guild.
        Promoted Cendarie and Astraall to officer. Killed a bunch of things here
        and there: The Deep, Cazic Thule, HoT, CoM, Chardok, Grotto, got trained
        by doofus guilds in Kael, CR some friends here and there, ravaged PoF
        multiple times trying to get some epic pieces and golem/Draco loot. Plus
        it is still my home away from Rivervale. We tried to do a PoG run in
        there too and some assholes that knew we were going cleared the rare
        stuff the night before. That's twice the same guild has screwed a
        preplanned raid of ours up.</p>
        <p align="left">We actually got our first swing at Cazic Thule his self
        recently and while we didn't kill him, we made two good attempts at him
        and learned a lot With some of our key classes missing or too busy
        elsewhere we did pretty damn good and am proud of the outcome. I
        appreciate those guilds that knew we were there leaving us be and
        letting us have our first shot. Thank you guys. Here's a few photos for
        those that haven't had the pleasure of meeting him.</p>

        <p align="left">Lag sucks, contested spawns suck, inconsiderate people
        suck, Legends sucks, Verant sucks! Ok, I feel a little better. Not going
        to bother going off on a rant on any of those issues today, but I had to
        get that off my chest. I am still on a halfway hiatus of sorts to take
        care of sanity and some real life issues, but I have stopped in a bit.

        a Jugs and Reets spell extravaganza during the week and supplied the
        server with a bunch of much needed scrolls. I went with a single group
        down in the Hole last week and had a blast. No drama, no politics, no
        issues. Was nice. Then Friday night comes around and we were bored and
        looking for stuff to do so everyone piled in to one raft and headed to
        Timorous Deep to visit and old friend. Only way druids ever get epics in
        our guild is if we are all bored with nothing better to do like
        gnomeball or sumthin.</p>

        Deabbas's we ran to EK and did his last step so he could become another
        pirate in a world of many. Then the hodgepodge group that was left with
        me went and killed Tranix for kicks THEN we ran to a mostly cleared PoF
        on the hopes that Shissar might pop or we might get some other nice toys
        for people. The truly selfish reason is that I was bored beyond belief
        and felt like pulling my old homeland a bit. See what happens at 60? You
        go do stuff you swore <a href="images/SPIRIT.JPG"><img border="2" src="images/SPIRIT_small.JPG" alt="SPIRIT.JPG (88683 bytes)" align="left" width="100" height="75"></a>you
        would never do again out of utter boredom. I had a blast and only died
        once to the Amy Temple train. Saturday Aaramin took a couple of groups
        to Dragon Necropolis and farmed gems for a while and then Sunday was my
        Umbral raid. We killed a bunch of roamers and some rare guys like the
        two pictures. <a href="images/zelandtrajan.JPG"><img border="2" src="images/zelandtrajan_small.JPG" alt="zelandtrajan.JPG (86529 bytes)" align="right" width="100" height="75"></a> I really do like Umbral. Its like the Plane Fear
        on steroids with 100x the lag which adds a special bit of excitement and
        has fast respawns. Pssst Verant, how about you fix crap like that when
        your Legends crew gets bored playing babysitter. It's also the only
        outdoor area I know of that truly classifies as a dungeon crawl zone too
        so that's rather nice.</p>
        <p align="center">I was also reminded as to why I don't go on other
        people's raids anymore! Ya gotta love Lothared though.</p>

        <h4 align="left">February 18, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Last week I was still swamped outside of Norrath so I
        missed most of the fun again. Friday Tylon led a bunch down to the
        Chardok Royals area and got a few more epic pieces for folks. On Sunday
        we all went to Umbral to check out the new changes to that zone. During
        the raid I had yet <b><u>another</u></b> bad experience with our moronic
        support staff we call guides. For 3+ years we have continued to support
        an ongoing beta program of untested and unsupported production releases
        and Verant has continued to screw us over with a guide program that
        doesn't even understand the concept of customer service and continues to
        live by a &quot;the customer is guilty until they prove their own innocence&quot; creed. Yes, it's true! Sunday I was accused of
        exploiting and/or lying when an obvious bug that placed me beyond the
        locked door to Vex and at the entrance to the still unfinished zone. So
        to all you guides out there that have ever used the phrases &quot;can
        you prove its a bug?&quot; or &quot;we aren't allowed to do that, this
        is a nonCS zone&quot;. Quit! Quit now! Go do something more rewarding
        with your life, like eating bean dip in a small closet, than be a part
        of this farce any more. Just the fact that you even have such things as a
        &quot;nonCS&quot; zone is a reflection of your concern for your
        customers. You should rephrase that to read &quot;this zone has too many
        bugs for us to bother spending most of our time here so we are unwilling
        to help anyone there at all&quot;. Well, I have new phrase I thought of
        just for you. <b><font color="#FF0000"> Kiss my ass!</font></b></p>
        <h4 align="left">February 11, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Due to some family issues I had to take off out of town
        for the weekend and was left computerless. Yes, it's true! I was truly
        in a house without a single computer. I almost felt Amish. In my absence
        Baxz and Madeleine picked up the torch for me and led the assault on
        Servitor with about half of the expected crew and got new toys for
        Therus and Madeleine. Sunday they continued the HoT raid as planned and
        got a bunch of nice stuff there for the folks in attendance. See no
        pictures, no snappy remarks, it's obvious I was gone for the weekend!</p>
        <h4 align="left">February 1, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Just a quickie. Aphra led her first Vox raid last night
        and it was actually the first time I had ever seen that wench die. I
        mean Vox, not Aphra, I have seen Aphra die plenty of times. Anyway I
        took a couple of shots while we were there. Grats on all who got the
        stuff and grats on a successful run.</p>

        <h4 align="left">January 28, 2001</h4>
        <p align="left">The life of a guild leader can be a very rewarding
        experience if you have the right sort of people in your family. This
        past week was no exception. Andrianna had been working on her epic for
        quite sometime and had been begging and pleading for us to go back to
        that dismal Plane of Hate yet again. I finally asked what was in Hate we
        could possibly desire. <img border="0" src="images/andrinaked.jpg" width="253" height="15">
        Congrats Andrianna on your final piece and another ranger epic! Also
        while we were there we got essence for Penance (worthless twink, but it
        was gonna rot), another ranger gem for Mablung - grats on final piece
        for him too, last piece for Kardian's (picture below) Nature's Defender,
        and a bunch of other garbage. It may have been our fastest clearing of
        first floor and a ton of second floor yet. Baxz pulled until we begged
        for mercy and even the one he killed the most agrees. <img border="0" src="images/baxzx2.jpg" width="216" height="17"></p>
        <p align="left">Earlier in the week we explored the Deep (those pictures
        below, lag was iffy so all spells are off, but good shots other than
        that) and had an absolute blast fighting back to the elders and then due
        to the late hour had to log after we killed the first one. I can't
        believe people would rather sleep than have another 15 mins 100k hit
        point fight that drops nothing, but they did. Was a good time over all.
        Especially watching people fall off the invisible bridge as I had a
        relaxing smoke at the bottom. Alinaria took over a Folk raid in Dragon
        Necropolis and took enough people to have the rats running for the zone.
        Everyone had a good time I heard. I was too busy leveling that worthless
        twink and quite frankly don't much care to ever see Necropolis again
        myself. If a raids over full there I will always be the first to bail
        out.</p>
        <p align="left">On Saturday Aamen led a run deeper into the Ssra Temple.
        That's my family day and no EQ after they all get up and around, so I
        played with my kid and the guild played with snakes... everyone seemed
        to have fun though from all accounts I have heard and I was promised
        pictures I never got! Oh well, I am used to that. Congrats Aamen on the
        first big run being a great success.</p>

        <p align="left">Well that sums up the weekend more than anything else
        could right there! I wore people out and made them run around and get
        crap just for me and no one else, the way a good guild leader should do
        every week! There will be much more of that in the future!</p>
        <p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/BINKL.JPG" width="645" height="46"></p>
        <p align="left">On Friday we went to Umbral, Binkl sums it up above
        quite nicely, and had a great time. Got some new robes for some of the
        ladys, I got a new bracer, some spells, yada yada yada. Some pictures
        are below from those antics. Saturday we took down VS with a bunch of
        other folks, I was playing with family so I don't know the full scoop
        there. Sunday was HoT and more loot for me! I finished my set of Woven
        Grass (at least the pieces I would wear) and we got a TON of plate.
        Trajan and Steffron also finished the pieces they had desired.</p>

        kill some lizard called Ragefire for Hizz's final epic piece. A big
        thank you from us to RoA for the quick assistance on this slaying and a
        big Congrats to Hizz for a 15 month wait!</p>

        </b>We spent the last weekend in PoA to finish a few epics for people.
        Congrats to Aamen and Obliterator on those final pieces. Gurgel ran the
        motley crew of 24 of us through the paces and we systematically killed
        all the bad guys and decided to take the plunge and kill the Hand, which
        we were told we couldn't do with our force. Less than 20 of us made it
        to the last island for that fight (LDs, no keys, etc) and killed Hand
        without much of an issue. Some claim that he *might* have been killed
        once with a force twice our size, but no one could confirm. Thanks
        Gurgel for a well done raid and a big congrats to all of us for a job
        well done! Lots of people got new toys and those are all listed on the
        Open Forums board.</p>

        Hole for Yael and Scalekeeper to find them dead, but assisted a few more
        people with epics along the way. This allowed Kumari to finish his epic
        last week. Rialla took us all to the Plane of Growth and a bunch of
        people got some nice clothes, most notably Penance got a shiny new robe
        and Darkind got a nice new breastplate! Last but not least Trajan and
        company took out some more giants and cleaned up in Kael, with a bp to
        Secandor, multiple legs (Samas and Tydirium) and more, including two
        belts of silvery contention to the paladins! More updates to come soon.</p>
