      <p align="center">living &quot;untwinked&quot;, regaining the fear</p>
      <p align="left">There are a lot of unhappy people in the world, both ours
      and Norrath. As Verant representatives have said time and again not
      everyone will be happy with decisions that are made and patches that are
      put forth. However, it is just a game and you can quit at anytime. I know
      I have threatened to on a number of occasions and am still there everyday.
      Recently I came close again...</p>
      <p align="left">I could go on for pages on why I came close, and probably
      will over the next few weeks, but for now I just wanted to look at one
      issue. Boredom.</p>
      <p align="left">Maybe I have gotten to soft, maybe I have played to much,
      maybe I am just too good (snicker). I don't get the thrill I used to from
      walking into a new area and being genuinely scared of what was around the
      next bend. Remember when Splitpaw used to be frightening? It was this
      total adrenalin rush that made me love EQ to begin with. Ligge really has
      no fear. Actually most of my lives in Norrath are that way (5 characters
      over 10, Ligge at 31). I know what is around the next bend. I know what it
      will take to win most battles and I know when to run. At level 31 there is
      NOTHING in Norrath I feel I have to have. Ok, the Hierophant's Crook is
      one exception, but that's quite a ways away and I am sure many nights, and
      just as many deaths, of dragon slaying to get it. Anything else I can get
      anytime soon I can take it or leave it. There are a few lower level items
      (meaning the MoBs are green) I would like, but I hate camping places
      others get experience and tend not to do it. Plus many of those items
      don't sell to often or I have something so comparable that I can't see
      dropping 700pp on a bonus of 1 more wisdom... (i.e.. getting a chipped
      bone bracelet to replace a polished bone bracelet).</p>
      <p align="left">So how to get the thrill back? When have I had the most
      fun?</p>
      <p align="left">Questing and pure fear. Those two things seem to be my hot
      buttons.</p>
      <p align="left">So I started over again. I picked a class that I had no
      real interest in, no real desire to run through the paces with AND on a
      continent I hate! So was born my dwarven cleric. This also would allow me
      to work on the quests in that region.</p>
      <p align="left">Ligge is sitting with almost a full suit of small bronze,
      a fine steel morning star, extra polished bone bracer, savant's cap, etc
      in the bank. All intended to go to a new character one day. My partner and
      I are pretty much self sufficient amongst our many lives and she wanted a
      cleric badly to be around whenever she needed a resurrect and we couldn't
      find another available. So I knew inevitably I would be making one...
      however, I never passed a single item. I figured I would get bored with
      the no risk issues as a level 1 cleric running around Butcherblock in full
      bronze. Plus what would I have to look forward to?</p>
      <p align="left">First thing I did was run through Kaladim and hail
      everyone. Made notes and decided I could reasonably work on a couple of
      quests at a time if I only hunted things that were quest related (skunks,
      skeletons, Krag chicks, giant rats). I also have a distinct advantage that
      I know where most places and items are located in Norrath. My first lives
      were spent primarily on Faydwer so I have been all over, it has just been
      many months since then.</p>
      <p align="left">Let me just say I have had an absolute blast! There is
      fear again! There is immediate gratification since you actually see that
      experience bar go up after a kill. There is a certain joy from actually
      being able to complete quests in a reasonable amount of time. All issues
      that seem to disappear as you pass the 20 mark and beyond. One discussion
      we have had amongst ourselves is that life sucks after 20. I can't totally
      agree with that statement, but it's pretty close to the mark. As a druid
      the love began fading as I hit 30. I am sure each class is different.</p>
      <p align="left">Of course, Ligge will always be around, but I will always
      be starting new lives when I get bored. Untwinked. If you find yourself
      getting frustrated and bored, try it yourself. You might find you regain
      your prospective and maybe a little humility after you die at the hands of
      an orc pawn again.</p>
      <p align="left">Of course, as fate would have it... last night a
      frustrated 26th level cleric GAVE away everything he owned as he was
      giving up Norrath for good. As I was the only lower level dwarven cleric,
      untwinked, in the area he gave it all to me. One of the reasons I never
      passed all the stuff others had accumulated was I wanted to have a story
      on how I got my items. Well, he provided that in a big way. The whole
      exchange was done in /ooc and /shout so the whole zone knew what was going
      on. It was a most joyous occasion! So now of course I looked twinked to
      the hilt, but if anyone asks or criticizes I have a marvelous story to
      tell and a full zone of jealous witnesses that saw Kuen retire and pass on
      his equipment to a younger brethren in need. Thanks Kuen! It is
      unfortunate that someone like you has left Norrath. You are a rare
      exception to the greedy beggars and kill stealers I see too often!</p>
