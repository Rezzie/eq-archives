    <p align="center">The people of Norrath I intend to go back for</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">After 40+ seasons in Norrath I have developed quite a hate
    list. Both players and NPCs alike. There are quite a few hunters on the
    world of Fennin Ro I would like to see dead and one day that may be my new
    directive, but for now we will concentrate on the creature population.</p>
    <h5><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>1. Rosch Val L'Vlor<a href="images/roschvallvlormage.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/roschvallvlormagea.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155"></a></b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">This guy is just annoying. It seems like every time we had
    him close during the early days of the new gnoll populations take over over
    he was healed by a newcomer gnoll or somehow managed to knock us off our
    feet long enough to get the upper hand. I am still looking forward to the
    day I can unmercifully torment him. Maybe he should ask Ghanex what that
    means...</p>
    <h5 align="left"><b><font size="3" color="#800000"><img border="0" src="images/kithicor.jpg" align="left" width="206" height="155">2. Deserted House in Kithicor</font></b></h5>
    <p align="left">Ok, so its not one person. Something about this house is
    unique in that our team has taken out a pull of 10-15 Kithicor brethren at
    one time, yet this house of 6-9 is able to stomp us. Even with the
    roamers it pulls we have still taken better than this bunch of soon to be
    morsels.</p>
    <h5 align="left"><b><font size="3" color="#800000">3. Temple of Life Freaks</font></b></h5>
    <p align="left">I have tried to be nice, really I have... I needed some fish
    for a guy in<a href="images/ufo.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/ufoa.jpg" align="left" width="206" height="155"></a> Freeport and due to the Gods of Verant and their infinite lies
    I continued to capture this fish in the belief the mistake was on my side.
    However, as we all know the Stein quest was broken for ages and those of us
    that went and destroyed our Temple of Life faction due to a broken quest are
    just out in the cold. So I killed putrid skeletons for hours on end in South
    Karana to please them. They still hate me and now so do the Corrupt Guards
    of Qeynos. I intend to enact my revenge in this silly UFO worshipping center
    soon enough.</p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000">4. Ogre Bouncers<img border="0" src="images/bouncers.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155"></font></h5>
    <p align="left">These fat wastes of flesh have sent me running plenty of
    times. They don't seem to take a snare and resist most over magic attacks.
    It amazes me that only the evil guards seem to have this sort of protection
    where as we halflings, along with gnomes and dwarves, are taken out rather
    routinely by people well below my ability.</p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>5. Brownie Guards</b></font><a href="images/browniecamp.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/browniecampa.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155"></a></h5>
    <p align="left">Small pests. They have caused enough deaths of innocent
    people to deserve permanent annihilation. These guys are probably next on
    the hit list to fall. Plus I hear I can make chocolate with their brownie
    parts.</p>
