    <p align="left">Woohoo I made 50! Ebay here I come! Just kidding Verant. I
    have too much time and friends invested in Ligge to ever do that anyway. So
    that helps explain why I have been so slow to update. The other issue is I
    have been on a few Planes raids and am currently amassing the team to do it
    ourselves soon. Many of us our nonguilded and I for one cringe everytime
    someone say &quot;if you want to get the good stuff you have to join a
    guild&quot; BAH! I say it isn't so and aim to prove that.</p>
    <p align="left">So many of us have gotten together and plan to do just that.
    Working with Emalythe of Inner Peace Fellowship and Grudge Bearer friends we
    are ready to give it a try soon. After the first run I will give an account
    of my past raids and what we found when we tried it ourselves. Until then
    wish us luck... I already have lots of pictures of the past ones and will
    possibly get some of those up beforehand.</p>
    <p align="left">Spliner has added his thoughts on spell line ups for upper
    levels and I have posted it here - <a href="articles/clericspellloading.html"> Cleric Spell Loading</a>.
    Enjoy. Cailette also sent me this site: <a href="http://eqphotos.eqrealms.com/" target="_blank">Everquest
    Player Photos</a>. I did send in my pics for Fennin. Be afraid, be very very
    afraid.</p>
    <p align="center">Tired of being inspected? But how do you tell him no?</p>

    <p align="left">Been busy trying to get up to 49 recently but I thought
    people might be interested in a few things I found recently. If you read the
    information on <a href="articles/showeq.html">experience dividing in EQ</a>
    check out this <a href="http://www.geocities.com/GroupExp/" target="_blank">Group
    Builder</a> application. As well as this nice little <a href="http://home.cwru.edu/~btd/dennys.html" target="_blank">Denny's
    parody</a> and this unbelievably scary <a href="http://members.home.net/turnertribe/falconspride/harmy.html" target="_blank">dancing
    ogre</a> that gave me a chuckle!</p>
    <p align="left">Spliner, previously of the Everguide web site, and one of my
    constant group members,&nbsp; has added his 2 cents on the art of becoming a
    <a href="articles/smithing.html">master smith</a>!</p>
    <p align="left">I reposted the <a href="articles/druidspells1-19.htm">druid
    spell list for levels 1-19</a> and hopefully I can add the rest sometime
    next week. I just glanced over at it quickly so if you see any errors feel
    free to let me know.</p>
    <p align="left">Well I had a nice weekend, finally! I got my Elder's
    Spiritist's Vambraces - wooohooo green sleeves! - on Friday night. Thank
    you to Vaprak and Ingmar who we added to our group to give them a teleport
    and got the drop off the sentry at that moment in time. Then.. Saturday I
    got my Degenerate Guk Weed and Sunday tracked down Moltor to get my Paw.
    Efreeti and Bilge beware I am coming for you both! Dang I am cute!</p>

    <p align="left">Ok, blatant advertising time. While chatting about books
    today with Cailette I recalled the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380809060/everquessucks">Chronicles<img border="0" src="images/advertisers/amber.jpg" align="right" width="70" height="116">
    of Amber</a> series and happened to make a jaunt over to Amazon and I found
    the entire series of Amber in ONE book for $16.00. That's just too good to
    pass up!</p>
    <p>I updated and edited my old <a href="articles/jewelry.htm">article on
    jewelry</a> and some things to think about at lower levels. You 200
    intelligence or wisdom twinks running around at level 14 are really missing
    the boat. Hopefully this will help some of the newer jewelry shoppers with a
    better idea on what's good to buy for when.</p>

    old world I have taken a new approach to my adventuring. Most of our team
    has vowed to stay away from spoilers and such and have chosen to explore
    this more on our own. It's been a blast so far. <a href="photos/kunark1.htm">Here
    are some new pictures for the gallery</a>.</p>
    <p align="left">A review of one of my favorite midteen zones, <a href="articles/lavastorm.html">Lavastorm

    <p align="left">Cailette has joined up (finally) and will be adding her own
    articles to this site in the future. To get started she has given a <a href="articles/cailetteintro.html"> little
    background</a> of her own as well as one <a href="articles/cailettecrafting.html">concerning
    her craft</a>.</p>
    <p align="left">There has always been a lot of debate on how experience is
    divided and earned within a group and across levels. Some guys, using ShowEQ,
    have made <a href="articles/showeq.html"> some interesting findings</a> and I am reposting what's been
    circulating here. I think, if you understand the numbers, you will find most
    of their information to be pretty close.</p>
    <p align="left"><a href="eqsites.htm">EQSites</a> page got a few adjustments and a few adds this round
    also.</p>
