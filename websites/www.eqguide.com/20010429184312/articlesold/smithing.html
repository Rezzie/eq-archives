      <p>So ye would like to be a smith eh?</p>
      <p>I've gone through the guides available for smithing on other sites, and
      every one of them tells you to start making skewers after reaching a skill
      level of</p>
      <p>28-30. Doing this will cost you HUNDREDS of platinum, and in my humble
      opinion is a waste of time. The guide below is tested to get you to a
      skill</p>
      <p>level of 100 while giving you something to sell rather than wasting all
      of your time trying to make skewers.</p>
      <p>First, save up 20 practice points. You can start smithing earlier,
      however I would reccomend you start around level 20ish so that you can
      easily afford the</p>
      <p>materials. Put all 20 points on blacksmithing, and start to gather as
      many rusty weapons as you can.</p>
      <p>Skill Level 0</p>
      <p>-Dump 20 practice points on smithing at your guildmaster, any other
      method will simply take too long in my opininion.</p>
      <p>Skill Level 20</p>
      <p>-Sharpen Sharpen Sharpen. Speed kill every newbie monster you can find
      in BB, Freeport, and Lesser Faydark, and sharpen their weapons. 2h swords
      will</p>
      <p>take you all the way to 30 skill. This is going to take some patience
      on your part, the rusty weapons are too expensive to buy, and you'll have
      to deal with</p>
      <p>the spawns but keep at it.</p>
      <p>Skill Level 28-30</p>
      <p>-Purchase as much ore as you can (I grabbed 2 backpacks full from the
      windmills and gated home) (buy only small pieces of ore)</p>
      <p>-convert them into metal bits, all of them.</p>
      <p>-buy scaler molds outside of Kalidim and follow the directions in your
      smithing book to make scalers until you reach 40 skill.</p>
      <p>(This is where most guides tell you to skip ahead to skewers however
      scalers will give you more exp at this level than skewers and you should
      have about a 1</p>
      <p>in 3 chance of making them or better. At the time I wrote this guide
      scalers were bugged, and they produced a lid mold instead of a scaler, but
      it matters</p>
      <p>not, you can sell them back to the shops for money to continue smithing.
      If you were to try skewers at this point, you'd probably never make a
      skewer</p>
      <p>and would be throwing all that money down the drain)</p>
      <p>Skill Level 40</p>
      <p>-Purchase more ore (as much as you can afford, like a backpack or two
      full) and convert it into metal bits.</p>
      <p>-Purchase Lantern Casing molds, empty bottles, and as much water as you
      have metal bits.</p>
      <p>-make large lanterns until it is trivial for you. Skewers are STILL too
      hard to make, if anyone tells you to make skewers tell them thanks for the
      info but i'm</p>
      <p>doing just fine.</p>
      <p>(you will have a decent success rate at lanterns, and hey, guess what,
      it's the first Item you can make as a smith that is actually wanted by
      players! Selling</p>
      <p>them back to shops will gain you a bit over a gold piece per lantern,
      but players will buy them for up to 3 gold pieces in places like Freeport,
      or anywhere</p>
      <p>races without infravision live. Lanterns should take you well over 55
      skill, and if you've got the extra money to purchase some metal sheets
      you'll notice</p>
      <p>that you can start making banded gorgets around 55 skill with about a
      60% failure rate.</p>
      <p>Skill Level 55-100</p>
      <p>Skewers skewers and more skewers!</p>
      <p>Now it's time to start on those skewers. They'll raise you well over
      master level (100), and give you better success rates on banded. At around
      60ish you can try the easiest of banded, but you'll still have an
      expensive failure rate.</p>
      <p>Skill Level 100+</p>
      <p>(banded items are the same ac as chain, and are lighter. You can even
      sell them to players or trade for chain items. You can actually start with
      banded gorgets in the 60's, however your cost on banded gorgets is going
      to run you up to 3-4p at first so you're not going to make any money
      selling them for 3-4p each but as time goes on it'll get easier and your
      cost will drop to under 2p per gorget. Tunics, Pants, Arms, Boots and
      things of that nature are going to take be easier at 100+ skill to make,
      so try the easiest items at first like sleeves, gloves, boots, helms.
      Bracers and gorgets are going to go trivial around master level so
      continue on with tunics and pants somewhere in the 120's range.</p>
      <p>This is where my smith is today, level 50 with 117 skill. I'll keep
      updating this guide as he improves and finds the best methods to increase
      your skill, and not cost you a fortune. Banded has been expensive. There
      are so many twinks in Norrath, most of the times you're going to have to
      sell it back to a vendor at cost. HOWEVER! With the new release of Kurnak,
      there is a great market for medium sized banded in the Calibus areas where
      the newbie Iksars need armor. Most of them are twinks, and have lots of
      money to burn. For a short while at least, the market for banded has
      gotten better.</p>
