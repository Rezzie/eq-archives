        <h4 align="left">April 29, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Yeah yeah I know I have been slacking. I have some where
        around 100 photos on my drive at home to go through and just haven't had
        time. Soon I promise. In the meantime you can see from our<a href="http://www.calsnet.com/changingtide/" target="_blank">
        calendar</a> we have been just busy as hell lately. I know quite a few
        people have hit 60 the last few weeks. Tzhisaz, Kalaelin, Budaas for
        sure. Multiple HoT runs, Dragon Necropolis, Hole, PoG, Trakanon. I will
        try and get those pictures done, but right now crunching experience and
        trying to run some raids when I am able.</p>
        <h4 align="left">April 2, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Just a quickie today as we have a new epic ranger. That
        means we are now actively recruiting clerics again!</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="2" src="images/tigok.jpg" width="400" height="370"></p>
        <h4 align="left">April 1, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">No April Fool's jokes today from me. I have seen enough
        already today and I bet you have too. Last couple of weeks have been
        pretty busy and we have started going through some changes to hopefully
        gear us up for the future. I am trying to earn my title and the hatred
        of others as best I can, but for some reason some of them still like me.
        WE roamed around a bunch from Hate, Fear (these places are getting old
        and so are epics!), Maidens, PoA, Grotto, Kael, umm quest stuff, tried
        to do PoG and once again found it empty. Fought with some psycho that
        thinks scheduling a raid on their own board requires the rest of server
        to pay attention and heed their intentions... hell, it wasn't even that
        way when the calendar was around.</p>
        <p align="left">In a move to improve our resources and still keep our
        family atmosphere we have added Forbidden Union as partners for our
        future endeavors. We are glad to have them as part of the nice little
        triad we have created.</p>
        <p align="left">Also as part of the internal changes we have created a
        new position in the guild as more or less a recruiter type role. We
        promoted 6 people to the Application Committee and their job is to
        review and evaluate new guild applicants. During this time we also
        promoted Aamen as an officer and appointed him to lead the first group
        and get it started. Congratulations to Aamen on officer and to Trajan,
        Alinaria, Crylyn, Aaramin, Dingly, and Sakkara on these new roles on the
        committee. Less work for me, more work for them, it's all good.</p>
        <h4 align="left">March 20, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Hey remember me? Well I am mostly back and trying to
        catch up on some things. We have added some new faces to the guild.
        Promoted Cendarie and Astraall to officer. Killed a bunch of things here
        and there: The Deep, Cazic Thule, HoT, CoM, Chardok, Grotto, got trained
        by doofus guilds in Kael, CR some friends here and there, ravaged PoF
        multiple times trying to get some epic pieces and golem/Draco loot. Plus
        it is still my home away from Rivervale. We tried to do a PoG run in
        there too and some assholes that knew we were going cleared the rare
        stuff the night before. That's twice the same guild has screwed a
        preplanned raid of ours up.</p>
        <p align="left">We actually got our first swing at Cazic Thule his self
        recently and while we didn't kill him, we made two good attempts at him
        and learned a lot With some of our key classes missing or too busy
        elsewhere we did pretty damn good and am proud of the outcome. I
        appreciate those guilds that knew we were there leaving us be and
        letting us have our first shot. Thank you guys. Here's a few photos for
        those that haven't had the pleasure of meeting him.</p>

        <p align="left">I am probably missing out on some headlines here, but it
        was another late nighter for me and I am pretty beat. Some new things
        going on internally for us and I promise to try and keep this more
        updated now.</p>
        <p align="left">By the way, never thought I would say this... thank you
        Verant for finally giving us chat channels!</p>
        <h4 align="left">March 4, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Guildleader can't be found. All the officers ran away.
        No one sent me pictures. We are skipping this update and maybe even next
        weeks too! Back in action soon I promise... and lots to come when I am.</p>
        <h4 align="left">February 25, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Lag sucks, contested spawns suck, inconsiderate people
        suck, Legends sucks, Verant sucks! Ok, I feel a little better. Not going
        to bother going off on a rant on any of those issues today, but I had to
        get that off my chest. I am still on a halfway hiatus of sorts to take
        care of sanity and some real life issues, but I have stopped in a bit.
        Lomack <a href="images/oneraft.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/oneraft_small.jpg" alt="oneraft.jpg (99537 bytes)" align="right" width="100" height="74"></a>led
        a Jugs and Reets spell extravaganza during the week and supplied the
        server with a bunch of much needed scrolls. I went with a single group
        down in the Hole last week and had a blast. No drama, no politics, no
        issues. Was nice. Then Friday night comes around and we were bored and
        looking for stuff to do so everyone piled in to one raft and headed to
        Timorous Deep to visit and old friend. Only way druids ever get epics in
        our guild is if we are all bored with nothing better to do like
        gnomeball or sumthin.</p>
        <p align="left">After killing Faydedar <a href="images/FAYDEDARdeab.JPG"><img border="2" src="images/FAYDEDAR_small.JPG" alt="FAYDEDAR.JPG (130530 bytes)" align="right" width="100" height="75"></a>for
        Deabbas's we ran to EK and did his last step so he could become another
        pirate in a world of many. Then the hodgepodge group that was left with
        me went and killed Tranix for kicks THEN we ran to a mostly cleared PoF
        on the hopes that Shissar might pop or we might get some other nice toys
        for people. The truly selfish reason is that I was bored beyond belief
        and felt like pulling my old homeland a bit. See what happens at 60? You
        go do stuff you swore <a href="images/SPIRIT.JPG"><img border="2" src="images/SPIRIT_small.JPG" alt="SPIRIT.JPG (88683 bytes)" align="left" width="100" height="75"></a>you
        would never do again out of utter boredom. I had a blast and only died
        once to the Amy Temple train. Saturday Aaramin took a couple of groups
        to Dragon Necropolis and farmed gems for a while and then Sunday was my
        Umbral raid. We killed a bunch of roamers and some rare guys like the
        two pictures. <a href="images/zelandtrajan.JPG"><img border="2" src="images/zelandtrajan_small.JPG" alt="zelandtrajan.JPG (86529 bytes)" align="right" width="100" height="75"></a> I really do like Umbral. Its like the Plane Fear
        on steroids with 100x the lag which adds a special bit of excitement and
        has fast respawns. Pssst Verant, how about you fix crap like that when
        your Legends crew gets bored playing babysitter. It's also the only
        outdoor area I know of that truly classifies as a dungeon crawl zone too
        so that's rather nice.</p>
        <p align="center">I was also reminded as to why I don't go on other
        people's raids anymore! Ya gotta love Lothared though.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/otherraids.jpg" width="588" height="151"></p>
        <h4 align="left">February 18, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Last week I was still swamped outside of Norrath so I
        missed most of the fun again. Friday Tylon led a bunch down to the
        Chardok Royals area and got a few more epic pieces for folks. On Sunday
        we all went to Umbral to check out the new changes to that zone. During
        the raid I had yet <b><u>another</u></b> bad experience with our moronic
        support staff we call guides. For 3+ years we have continued to support
        an ongoing beta program of untested and unsupported production releases
        and Verant has continued to screw us over with a guide program that
        doesn't even understand the concept of customer service and continues to
        live by a &quot;the customer is guilty until they prove their own innocence&quot; creed. Yes, it's true! Sunday I was accused of
        exploiting and/or lying when an obvious bug that placed me beyond the
        locked door to Vex and at the entrance to the still unfinished zone. So
        to all you guides out there that have ever used the phrases &quot;can
        you prove its a bug?&quot; or &quot;we aren't allowed to do that, this
        is a nonCS zone&quot;. Quit! Quit now! Go do something more rewarding
        with your life, like eating bean dip in a small closet, than be a part
        of this farce any more. Just the fact that you even have such things as a
        &quot;nonCS&quot; zone is a reflection of your concern for your
        customers. You should rephrase that to read &quot;this zone has too many
        bugs for us to bother spending most of our time here so we are unwilling
        to help anyone there at all&quot;. Well, I have new phrase I thought of
        just for you. <b><font color="#FF0000"> Kiss my ass!</font></b></p>
        <h4 align="left">February 11, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Due to some family issues I had to take off out of town
        for the weekend and was left computerless. Yes, it's true! I was truly
        in a house without a single computer. I almost felt Amish. In my absence
        Baxz and Madeleine picked up the torch for me and led the assault on
        Servitor with about half of the expected crew and got new toys for
        Therus and Madeleine. Sunday they continued the HoT raid as planned and
        got a bunch of nice stuff there for the folks in attendance. See no
        pictures, no snappy remarks, it's obvious I was gone for the weekend!</p>
        <h4 align="left">February 1, 2002</h4>
        <p align="left">Just a quickie. Aphra led her first Vox raid last night
        and it was actually the first time I had ever seen that wench die. I
        mean Vox, not Aphra, I have seen Aphra die plenty of times. Anyway I
        took a couple of shots while we were there. Grats on all who got the
        stuff and grats on a successful run.</p>

        <h4 align="left">January 28, 2001</h4>
        <p align="left">The life of a guild leader can be a very rewarding
        experience if you have the right sort of people in your family. This
        past week was no exception. Andrianna had been working on her epic for
        quite sometime and had been begging and pleading for us to go back to
        that dismal Plane of Hate yet again. I finally asked what was in Hate we
        could possibly desire. <img border="0" src="images/andrinaked.jpg" width="253" height="15">
        Congrats Andrianna on your final piece and another ranger epic! Also
        while we were there we got essence for Penance (worthless twink, but it
        was gonna rot), another ranger gem for Mablung - grats on final piece
        for him too, last piece for Kardian's (picture below) Nature's Defender,
        and a bunch of other garbage. It may have been our fastest clearing of
        first floor and a ton of second floor yet. Baxz pulled until we begged
        for mercy and even the one he killed the most agrees. <img border="0" src="images/baxzx2.jpg" width="216" height="17"></p>
        <p align="left">Earlier in the week we explored the Deep (those pictures
        below, lag was iffy so all spells are off, but good shots other than
        that) and had an absolute blast fighting back to the elders and then due
        to the late hour had to log after we killed the first one. I can't
        believe people would rather sleep than have another 15 mins 100k hit
        point fight that drops nothing, but they did. Was a good time over all.
        Especially watching people fall off the invisible bridge as I had a
        relaxing smoke at the bottom. Alinaria took over a Folk raid in Dragon
        Necropolis and took enough people to have the rats running for the zone.
        Everyone had a good time I heard. I was too busy leveling that worthless
        twink and quite frankly don't much care to ever see Necropolis again
        myself. If a raids over full there I will always be the first to bail
        out.</p>
        <p align="left">On Saturday Aamen led a run deeper into the Ssra Temple.
        That's my family day and no EQ after they all get up and around, so I
        played with my kid and the guild played with snakes... everyone seemed
        to have fun though from all accounts I have heard and I was promised
        pictures I never got! Oh well, I am used to that. Congrats Aamen on the
        first big run being a great success.</p>

        <p align="left">Well that sums up the weekend more than anything else
        could right there! I wore people out and made them run around and get
        crap just for me and no one else, the way a good guild leader should do
        every week! There will be much more of that in the future!</p>
        <p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/BINKL.JPG" width="645" height="46"></p>
        <p align="left">On Friday we went to Umbral, Binkl sums it up above
        quite nicely, and had a great time. Got some new robes for some of the
        ladys, I got a new bracer, some spells, yada yada yada. Some pictures
        are below from those antics. Saturday we took down VS with a bunch of
        other folks, I was playing with family so I don't know the full scoop
        there. Sunday was HoT and more loot for me! I finished my set of Woven
        Grass (at least the pieces I would wear) and we got a TON of plate.
        Trajan and Steffron also finished the pieces they had desired.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/BUTTER.JPG" width="285" height="18"><br>

        kill some lizard called Ragefire for Hizz's final epic piece. A big

        big Congrats to Hizz for a 15 month wait!</p>

        Congrats to Aamen and Obliterator on those final pieces. Gurgel ran the
        motley crew of 24 of us through the paces and we systematically killed
        all the bad guys and decided to take the plunge and kill the Hand, which
        we were told we couldn't do with our force. Less than 20 of us made it
        to the last island for that fight (LDs, no keys, etc) and killed Hand
        without much of an issue. Some claim that he *might* have been killed
        once with a force twice our size, but no one could confirm. Thanks
        Gurgel for a well done raid and a big congrats to all of us for a job

        people with epics along the way. This allowed Kumari to finish his epic
        last week. Rialla took us all to the Plane of Growth and a bunch of
        people got some nice clothes, most notably Penance got a shiny new robe
        and Darkind got a nice new breastplate! Last but not least Trajan and
        company took out some more giants and cleaned up in Kael, with a bp to
        Secandor, multiple legs (Samas and Tydirium) and more, including two
        belts of silvery contention to the paladins! More updates to come soon.</p>
