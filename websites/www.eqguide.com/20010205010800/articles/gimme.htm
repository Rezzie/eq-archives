      SoW!&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Got some spare plat&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I NEED A HEAL&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Who can SoW?&quot;</p>
    <p>Ok ok ok ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!</p>
    <p>First off let's start with SoW (Spirit of the Wolf)... It is not a right of every
    citizen in Norrath to have SoW. If it was a god given right then journeyman's boots would
    not be a NODROP item and every casting class would have SoW in their arsenal. Don't get me
    wrong the Jboots issue is a total mistake on Verant's part, but that is another debate.
    Why oh why would you make an item that encourages level 50s to come camp a level
    40 spawn for 29 hours straight to help guild members get them? Ok off of that and on to
    SoW...</p>
    <p>You people that demand SoW,&nbsp; send tells for SoW, or just ask the question &quot;who
    can SoW&quot;.. can all kiss my little arse!! Yes you heard me. I began druidic studies
    because I liked the abilities I would be trained in, not so I could make everyone run
    faster. What amazes me is people expect you to do it. I have never charged or asked for
    money. I have accepted donations and in many cases will reSoW those people that did donate
    everytime I see them without them asking. But for you to come up to me and say &quot;Yo
    give me SoW&quot; is ridiculous. It cost mana, it costs time. maybe not much, but don't
    you hate being in a group where your partners are always off healing,
    rezzing, buffing others
    while your team suffers? That's what you are asking druids to do. Be nice. Be polite. Ask
    for it!</p>
    <p>I will go out of my way to assist somebody that gives a story or is polite.</p>
    <p>&quot;I am traveling from Qeynos to help save Rivervale from the goblin scum. Can
    anyone SoW me please at the stone bridge?&quot;</p>
    <p>I will be on my way immediately if I can. If I am in a group, they come first, but if
    not I will normally come running.</p>
    <p>Asking &quot;Who can SoW?&quot; is simply inappropriate. Don't you people have
    manners? I won't even respond to it normally. Just because I can doesn't mean I will or
    that you deserve it. Especially you dark elven folk. With a few exceptions, of course, you
    are the most vile scum Norrath has to offer. I hunt your kind for fun. Why do you think I
    would SoW you? Didn't you spend your formative years hunting my race in your bleak
    forest
    area?? Now you want my help?? NO!</p>
    <p>This applies just as much to &quot;I NEED A HEAL&quot; and &quot;GIVE ME A CURE&quot;.
    Yeah so what? Why should I heal you?? &quot;Can you heal me please?&quot; will work much
    better for you rude people I promise. Try it.</p>
    <p>Now... donations, begging, whining... whatever you worthless pieces of froglok dung
    want to call what you do... GET A LIFE. Those of us with nice equipment did not spend the
    hours to get it so that we could twink or powerlevel some unknown fool that comes begging for money. You
    are an embarrassment to us all and need to go earn your keep like those of us that have
    been in Norrath since its creation.</p>
      <p>Now before anyone flames me for acting like this is a druid problem. No it isn't. This
    is a problem for pretty much every caster class in some way. Whether it be Courage, Valor,
    Group teleports, or Clarity we all have to deal with whiners expecting us to use our time
    and our mana to make your life better. Many of us will, and many of us don't mind most of
    the time, but think about what you are asking and by all means tip accordingly. I
    can assure you I rarely care how much people give me. I have received from 1 silver up to 10pp
    for binds, buffs, SoWs. It is always the thought that counts.</p>
