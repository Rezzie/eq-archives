      <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments:</span>  This
      quest begins with Furtog Ogrebane, a descendant of the great Trundle.
      Trundle was killed by Crushbone's clan and if you would like to help seek
      revenge on them see the <a href="#Orc Hunting" target="_self">quest below</a>.
      However, Furtog would like you to get revenge on the vile Mudtoe Ogres.
      The two ogres in question are both in the Ocean of Tears and are somewhere
      in their high teens. They are located on the two islands west of the
      Sister Island that the boat stops at from Freeport. Kill them and return
      their heads to Furtog. I got the Ogre Maul on the first try. One of the
      ogres shares a spawn with a cyclops that is in his 40's, fortunately he is
      camped often and the guys killing him will typically let you either kill
      or just loot the Mudtoe's head. The one on Gornit's Island is always him
      as far as I can tell.</p>
      <p align="left">The alternative to this is the rogue side of things. Bring
      Diggins Boog's head for the dwarf only Mining Pick 628. He typically gives
      you this quest after you bring him the <a href="#Rogue Tongues" target="_self">rogue
      tongues</a>.</p>

      armor comes from Vacto Molunel in the warriors guild entrance in Kaladim.
      It is his &quot;rare talent&quot; and is reserved for worthy warriors.
      This armor is the green metal you see the short guys running around in and
      comes in 3 shapes. Boots, Helm, Breastplate. The Helm requires 2 carapaces
      (worker scarabs have them) and 5 gold pieces. The Breastplate require 23
      gold pieces and a pristine carapace from giant scarabs. The Boots need a
      cracked carapace and 17 gold. As luck would have it, I was given a gift of
      bronze replacements by a retiring cleric and in turn gave away my scarab
      armor the day I got all 3 pieces and I didn't write down the stats. I
      think they are; breastplate: AC 8 Wt 6 Sta +1 Dex -1, helm AC 4 cha -1,
      boots AC 4 Wt 4.5. The boot quest is given after completing one of the
      others, I believe the helm, if your faction is high enough. These are
      wearable by only halflings, gnomes, and dwarves. They also have the unique
      quality that they are still visible on druids in wolf form. So if you ever
      wondered why that wolf had green feet running around... now you know.</p>

      down and destroy the great military strategists the Crushbone Orcs. For
      proof of your deeds he wants belts and pads. The belts are rewarded for
      every one, the shoulder pads for every two. Some claim the rewards are
      great for this.. experience yes, at the level you can begin it, however I
      never got much in the way of great items.</p>

      <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>A
      series of quests are available from Byzar Bloodforge. The first is to get
      rid of the goblin menace. He will accept no less than 4 sets of goblin
      runnyeye warbeads. My opinion.. waste of good beads. Save them and turn
      them in in Rivervale for the <a href="rivervale.asp#One with the Wall?" target="_self">Squad
      Ring</a> quest there. Alternately Diggins, near the mine will also take
      these, as I said... save them for Rivervale.</p>
      <p align="left">Zarchoomi and Corflunk are two Ogres roaming through
      Butcherblock and in 10 levels completed in this land I NEVER saw them
      once. However I have seen them many times in other lives and completed the
      quest a few times. This now will give you Bloodforge Armor. Same stats as
      Blackened but the new stuff is dwarf only and only warrior, cleric, or
      paladin. Duh, its metal. However, if you get lucky and get the helm it
      does have the same stats as the Blackened Iron Crown and, well, that is
      just wonderful. I get a request a day from people inspecting me asking to
      buy mine.</p>
      <p align="left">Now you are ready for the good part of this one. The
      hammer. Ligge used this hammer from the day he put down his Rune Totem
      Staff until he got his Observer Staff. Light source, hits hard, and has
      some magic resistance added. Great for those days I was soloing evil eyes
      in East Karana. A really simple procedure. Go kill Trumpy Irontoe in
      Qeynos and bring his head back to Byzar. He hangs out in the bar by the
      docks. Best way I found was to wait on the docks until he walked out and
      around the buildings on the waters edge. Do NOT blast him in sight of
      guards, bouncers, and patrons. They will jump you and kill you. The days
      right after this quest made it to the websites there were multiple bodies
      around the area from people killed by guards for hurting Trumpy. I always
      just waited on him to come out. I have been told you can ask him about
      Sragg or get him drunk and these both will make him leave the bar sooner.
      Of course if you just want the hammer the tend to sell for 15-50pp these
      days. Personally I think this is a hell of a lot better 2hb than a Glowing
      Wooden Crook from Lockjaw. I had the hammer a month, that I got for free,
      bought a Crook and used it one day before selling it.</p>

      <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>There
      are actually two people that give this quest. The warriors or the rogues.
      If you are a warrior and you kill bandits you can get faction to do it
      both places, rogues go kill goblins and orcs. The first time (I did it
      with Beno Targnarle the warrior, Jeets is the rogue to see) he only needed
      1 pelt and gave me the cape above. From then on he wanted 4 and I got
      nothing of great interest. I never did turn in 4 to the rogues as my
      faction just got high enough for them to talk to me and Giant Rat Pelts
      are not that easy to come by in Kaladim. The Giant rat is found in the
      second cave in the mining area next to the bank. There is also a
      &quot;metal rat&quot;, a gnomish creature, roaming. Kill him and give the
      black box fragments to Beno for the <a href="#Knight Card" target="_self">Knight
      card quest</a>. I have not tested to see if any blackbox fragments will
      do. If so they are easy to get in Akanon down in the mine are there also.</p>
      <p align="left">From the rogue side of things you can give Jeet the
      blackbox fragments for a Miner's Cap.</p>

      of Vanear quest where you can play a game with Moodro and give him&nbsp; 4
      gold for a playing card. Sometimes it is a Knight. The Knight card goes to
      the dwarf, Doran Vargnus, that resides on the Sister Island in the Ocean

      Ventille is upset because he has a slacker guard called Bundin. It is time
      to make an example of him and he wants you to go rid Butcherblock of this
      worthless guard. Kill him and bring his axe and head back to Hongunk, he
      above the arena area. He is seen most often near the docks and the
      quarreling guard area. Those two really are funny to go talk to anyway. As
      I tried to do this quest I never found Bundin and got tired of camping for
      him. Ligge will have to run back over with track and knock him out for the
      Kaladim residents.</p>

      Malfoot is in the Clerics guild, which is down the passage behind the
      bank. He does healing for 3 gold pieces, but also collects stinky skunk
      glands. In exchange for the glands you get experience and a spell. This
      along with the <a href="#Battle the Undead" target="_self">bone chips</a>
      and aviak chick talons (both below) is a great way to increase your
      leveling speed at lower levels.</p>

      can't even begin to count how many times I completed this quest. I
      concentrated on this one from 1-12 with the various aviaks and skunks
      thrown in at early levels. As a cleric this is made for you to live on.
      From the skeletons roaming, to the ones at the druid circle and tower, to
      the chessboard they are everywhere for the picking. 4 bones turned in at a
      time increases your faction and gives you some sort of minor item from a
      few silver to 2+ gold in value.</p>

      can't even begin to count how many times I completed this quest. I
      concentrated on this one from 1-12 with the various aviaks and skunks
      thrown in at early levels. As a cleric this is made for you to live on.
      From the skeletons roaming, to the ones at the druid circle and tower, to
      the chessboard they are everywhere for the picking. 4 bones turned in at a
      time increases your faction and gives you some sort of minor item from a
      few silver to 2+ gold in value. He also gives you the quest for Cromil's
      remains. Watch the text careful as he does the typical &quot;that's not
      enough bones&quot; bugged text after you give him all 4 and the Cromiltext
      is above that. The guy you see is Gunlok Jore back in the Paladin's Guild.
      Priestess Ghalea sends clerics to him to prove their worth and earn
      experience before she will give her quest to them below.</p>

      in the Paladins guild, back behind clerics, see Bumle Reminjar. He will
      start you out killing Krag chicks and bringing him 4 talons. After you get
      either high enough faction and/or level he will send you after Elders. I
      never did find an Elder since he gave me that part of the quest. Somewhere
      around level 8 he deemed me worthy of chasing Elders. I was always curious
      why people thought Aviaks were bad and suitable for killing, but at least
      as a dwarf it is a mission. I was told the items move up to leather and
      such for the Elders Talons.</p>

      is a follow up to the bone chips quest. After turning in the 4 bone chips
      he asks for help in finding Cromil. Cromil is in the South Karanas at Lord
      Grimrot's skeleton camp. The camp has skeletons and putrid skeletons in
      abundance as well as sometimes Lord Grimrot (2 versions level 18 and 35
      approx) and a dwarf skeleton. Rumor has it the dwarf skeleton is tied to
      the putrids so you need to keep killing those for him to show up. However,
      Ligge has killed the dwarf skeleton many times and checks every time he
      runs by and has NEVER gotten anything from him. I know I did a long time
      ago though.</p>

      begins with Beno. Ask him about the Eye of Stormguard and he will send you
      on your way to get this weapon. First is a letter that goes to the jail
      keep in Highkeep. She tells you about the Emerald Shard and sends you to
      find Bronin in Misty Thicket. Bronin is typically to the left of the wall
      passage if you are coming from Rivervale. I found him on top of the second
      tower. Nice long ladder climb and fall if you mess up. When you talk to
      Bronin you find out about a bounty hunter that is after him named Slaythe.
      This seems to actually spawn Slaythe. He is a casting froglok in his low
      20s. He lives right next to the orc camp in the back of Misty. Was a piece
      of cake at 31 but I saw him demolish a level 20 bard. This gives you a
      froglok leg to take to Bronin who then gives you a key H.K. 106. Take this
      back to Highkeep and get part one of shard. Bronin also says you need to
      go se the Scout master in Kelethin and ask him about the Gem of Tunare.
      Bronin heard that's what they are calling it there, silly woodelves they
      are after all.</p>
      <p align="left">You find out from the elven slackers that it was stolen by
      someone named Feldor Hendrys. No one knows where he is but his brother
      might. His brother is off in Dagnors. He is one of the guards at the camp
      there. He will inform you his thieving brother is probably in Qeynos as a
      thief. He shows up in N Qeynos from time to time. So go camp. Isn't that
      how these always end up?</p>
      <p align="left">Killing Feldor gets you part 2. Combine and you get the
      Eye of Stormguard (+5 magic, cold and fire protection). If this can be
      equipped as a range weapon it might be worth keeping for nonwarriors. I am
      not sure yet. Take this to Beno and you get the Axe if faction is high
      enough, as always. I got as far as waiting an hour or so sitting on my
      arse for Feldor to show up and gave up for now.</p>
