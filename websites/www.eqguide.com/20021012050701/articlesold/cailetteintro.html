      <p>Well it is official. Ligge and I have finally moved in together…..
      well, if you can call a blanket roll and fire on the beach outside Fironna
      Vie as living quarters. So not only do I get my own lil corner of the fire
      to call my very own, but I get a wee corner of his web site in lieu of a
      drawer in the bureau. So without further adieu, Welcome to Simply
      Enchanting.</p>
      <p>Well, my intentions are to discuss some of the relevant issues of my
      chosen profession with anyone interested in hearing another opinionated
      'chanter's opinion. In addition, I'll chatter a bit about some of the
      other things I do while not being utterly charming or pestering Ligge to
      bits with requests for this wee trinket or that to complete some quest or
      another.</p>
      <p><i>So who is this 'chanter that is going to spout off about the Craft? <br>
      </i>I was born in this incarnation the same time Ligge was, even though we
      did not meet until I had passed 5 tests of knowledge in my craft. So
      basically that means as a 'chanter, I have lived through both walk-outs,
      have know the early version of Whirl, and the current disappointment of
      Dynn's Dizzying Draught and many, many, many other changes in direction of
      my craft.</p>
      <p><i>So, why a Keeper of the Arts you ask?<br>
      </i>&nbsp;Well actually a silly reason when looked at the skills I have
      had to master to learn my craft…… I wanted to make pretty sparklies to
      give to friends I met along my travels in Norrath. Naïve, huh? But
      remember this was way back when Norrath was first discovered and none of
      us had much of an idea of how the world would shape itself with all the
      bold adventurers. But I suppose, having been born with the mark of
      Erollisi, that wasn't such a surprising wish on my part.</p>
      <p><i>So, how did I meet the Tree Hugger I share a camp with now?<br>
      </i>&nbsp;It was when I was a puny young thing. I was up on the hill
      outside Kelethin, desperately trying to do my part to rid the forests
      outside my home of the orc menace. And doing a poor job of it I might add.
      While I was resting after my sprint away from a particularly nasty
      centurion, I was chatting with another young enchantress about how I had
      hoped to begin my apprenticeship under a well known jeweler in Felwithe
      soon. Well, she and I were chattering away about what we had heard about
      jewel crafting, which stones were best used, and where they were to be
      found when a third voice piped up. Yes, it was my soon to be very own Tree
      Hugger. Well after we were rested, Ligge being the gallant halfling that
      he is asked us if we would like to band together to exact some revenge on
      the centurion who had sent us fleeing. Well, the rest is history.</p>
      <p>And by the way if you do have more questions for me, the Anitonican
      Bard society and I have a nice agreement. They know the corner of the
      beach we have set up on, they will get the message to me….. just address
      to <a href="mailto:Cailette@eqguide.com">Cailette@eqguide.com</a>, they
      will find us.
