    <p align="left">Brewers brew because they want to. There is no profit to
    speak of in brewing so if that is why this is a trade skill you are
    considering get that notion out of your head right now. Of course, there are
    a few exceptions to this rule.</p>
    <p align="left">Bog juice was profitable for a very short time before
    everyone realized that in Verant's infinite wisdom they created a component
    for a high level quest that even a beginning brewer could make easily on
    their own. The Heady Kiola's are needed for some of the cured silk items
    that enchanter's and tailor's can collaborate on. Tumpy's famed tonic does
    require decent skill (135 skill) and is used by many to &quot;buy&quot;
    experience so this can be sold if you really feel the need. Ol' Tujim's (135
    skill) can be sold to rogues for their quest. Others may crop up and if you
    count your coppers closely you can probably make a little on some of the
    others by selling to merchants if you are the high charisma sort, but don't
    plan on getting rich. It is still possible to buy most of the beginning
    brews cheaper at merchants than you can buy the supplies to make them.
    That's just silly, but nevertheless the way it works.</p>
      <p align="left">We do it because we prefer the taste of a homemade brew after a victorious
    hunt rather than the watered down swill you find in local taverns. We love it for the
    exotic drinks Gregor promised he would help us make, that is before we found out he is a
    liar. Most of all we love it because we drink! Almost anyone that has met me
      in some of the more solitary camping spots - Mitty, Permafrost, etc -
      knows that I bring drinks to pass out. It helps break the ice and avoids
      the &quot;Hey dude I am camping here!&quot; attitude most start with when
      you walk in a room. Hand the poor camper a Bleeding Brain when you walk in
      a room and they know you are there as friend and comrade, not foe.</p>
    <p align="left">Most items are available at vendors. If you are a forager
    then you you even have more drinks available to you easily involving
    vegetables, fruit, and berries. And who knows maybe even morning dew.
    &lt;laughs&gt; If you are not a forager and want to make some of these
    drinks just ask around for some. In our core group we have myself and a
    ranger. The enchanter and cleric have no problem getting supplies for drinks
    and baking from us and it works out even better for me as I have had
    Cailette making vodka from my foraging to increase her skill and returning
    the vodka to me to make Bleeding Brain to increase my skill.</p>

      BlackBurrow Cask available from the Gnolls. Doesn't require brewing skill,

      <p>Blackburrow Stout<br>
      Brandy<br>

      <p>At the present time we are maxed at 168 skill cap. Hopefully more stuff
      is coming. Verant swears Morning Dew is in Norrath but with 12 months
      under my belt and well over 100 played days I have never seen it so I have
      to agree with most brewers in that this is probably just another story.</p>
