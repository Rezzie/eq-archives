    <p align="left"><img src="images/fish.jpg" alt="Ligge EQ Druid" align="right" width="206" height="155">Anyone that has ever begged in my vicinity knows exactly how I feel about
    it. You have no pride in yourself if you are a beggar and should just stay out of my way.
    Money and food are so easy to come by that even the newest Norrath hunter should never
    want for anything with a little proper planning. Fishing is one of the greatest aspect
    towards self sufficiency and one of the easiest ways to not only occupy some time , but to
    make some easy cash along the way.</p>
    <p align="left">As a new Norrath hunter you are given enough food to make your way for a
    while without assistance. Live on that and save ALL of your initial money for a fishing
    pole and bait. YES ALL OF IT! Its only 25 silver pieces average per pole and 4 copper per
    bait. The best way I have found is to save up enough for 2 poles and 20 bait and go find a
    pond after making your purchases. So around 6 gold pieces should do it.</p>
    <p align="left">Why 2 poles? Well, because as a new fisher you are going to break quite a
    few at first. Don't worry this gets better with time. In a perfect world lets say you
    caught 20 fish with your bait. I know that is not going to happen in the beginning, but
    for economics sake its the best way to explain it. Each fish sells for an average of 2
    silver so 20 fish = 40 silver (4 gold). Enough to buy another pole and more bait if
    needed. The cost on that was 33 silver. If your pole is still unbroken you can buy more
    bait for 8 silver and make a tidy profit of over 3 gold on the next 20 fish. As you get
    older and more experienced your poles will break less often and a pole may last for a few
    hundred caught fish. I personally have not had a broken pole in a long time. Somewhere
    around 300-400 fish have been caught with my current pole.</p>
      <p align="left">Besides money for new items you are also feeding yourself rather well. You
    can always sell extra fish for coin and buy water flasks. Close to 3 flasks,
      4 depending on charisma and faction, for every 2
    fish sold. Along with fish you will catch daggers, sandals, and fish scales. The first 2
    can be sold easily and the last one can either be sold or held onto for yourself (if you
    get enduring breathe spell later) or given to others that need them.</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;Boring!!&quot; Well... maybe. You are currently just paying your
    dues as you train in fishing and eventually the pay off is even better. As a young man I
    was able to get all my spells paid for as well as better equipment from fishing proceeds
    alone! Soon you will not ever be in need of money again. you will never have to buy food
    again, only bait, and trading fish for water to merchants means that all of your food and
    water are costing you mere copper pieces (the cost of your bait) and your time.</p>
    <p align="left">Later you will appreciate this skill even more. I never go anywhere
    without at least one fishing pole on me. When I was still breaking poles I always carried
    2 poles and 20 bait everywhere I went. &quot;Why everywhere?&quot; Because water is
    everywhere in Norrath! Which means so are fish! This is a great way to occupy time waiting
    for the slow boats at Butcherblock and Freeport docks. A great way to occupy time if you
    are waiting for critters, party members, or just happen to be stranded on an island due to
    trying to help a hapless gnome named Gnabel....</p>
    <p align="left">One of the best aspects for casters is the trawling method. Arm yourself
    with your pole and meditate near water. You can have your fishing done at the same time.
    Great way to get 2 things done while you meditate or sit and heal. People find me doing
    this all the time in hunting areas and are always asking questions. I can not believe more
    don't do this while the wait to heal or regenerate mana for the next encounter.</p>
    <p align="left">For foragers this even gets better... I have not bought bait in many
    weeks. I forage enough food and fishing grub to keep me well fed and in bait that fishing
    is really not even necessary but I still do it. Why waste all the free fishing grub I
    forage? Plus I still have heal and meditate downtime, as well as the occasional dock wait.
    Fishing now does 2 things for me - extra income, not that I need it, but I am pretty well
    off financially because I collect from every revenue source I can. 20 fish is still worth
    4 gold and since I still have to meditate and heal, the second benefit fishing gives it it
    makes that time go by faster, I might as well fish and make an extra platinum piece from
    selling fish during my resting times. Plus with foraging that is all profit since I am no
    longer buying bait.</p>
      <p align="left">If you choose to take up baking as an additional skill the
      fish can be used to get your baking skill from 0 to about 132 or so with
      different recipes. SO you are occupying downtime and working on 2 skills
      that will feed you forever.</p>
    <p align="left">Remember you never have to go far to fish... water is EVERYWHERE.just look
    around you. Places I have fished with success: Runnyeye Citadel, every Karanas region,
    Crushbone, Lake Rathe, Ocean of Tears aqua goblin islands, Blackburrow, Lair of the
    SplitPaw, and of course every town or dock I have ever visited.</p>
      <p align="left">So you hungry beggars.. QUIT YOUR WHINING! Go buy a pole. I have even been
    known to give someone a pole or 2 that had begged for money or food and made them go earn
    it. You give a fool fish he eats tonight, you teach them to fish he eats forever!</p>
