    <p align="left">Life is a journey not a destination.</p>
    <p align="left">Welcome to Everquest Game Guide's quest section. Game hints, spoilers,
    walk thrus, and miscellaneous storyline information. I highly encourage you to take the
    time and do these quests on your own. I began doing quests out of typical solo boredom and
    have had more fun doing a lot of these quests than many a hunting trip. But, pages like
    this can take every bit of the fun out of the game if abused. Do you read the last chapter
    in every book you pick up? No, probably not. However, there are times when you have tried
    repeatedly to finish a quest without success or you just have to know why everyone is
    camping that little brownie. Those are the times that I feel you should peek.</p>
    <p align="left">Of course, you're on your own and you know what will make you happiest so
    you decide, but remember how quickly you got bored with Myst when you had the walk through
    printed out in front of you.</p>
    <p align="left">Ok, no more preaching.</p>
    <p align="left">Each section gets posted only after I have personally confirmed the
    majority of the quests located there. There are plenty of other sites that offer quest
    information based on readers submissions. I find too much inaccuracy and rumor in that
    method and am doing it different here. If you want to see those sites go see the <a href="../eqsites.htm">EQSites area</a>.</p>
    <p align="left"><u>I only lists quests in the zones they originate</u>, not always where
    the action takes place. In many cases they are totally different. If I feel that a
    significant number of people will look in the wrong zone, for example all the action takes
    place elsewhere, then there will be some note in both zones.</p>
    <p align="left">For each zone I also pick my favorite quest. It may be due to an item
    received or just the quest itself. Confirmed means that either I have personally done it
    or been involved in a group effort to do so. In some cases I rely on interviews. For
    example, the shark tank in Qeynos is heavily camped and below my ability, so why camp it.
    There is almost always a team there camping so I just explained what I was doing and asked
    for information on what they had found rather than camping their spot with them. Why add
    to the already ridiculous camping problems we already have in Norrath.</p>
    <p align="left">Some zones are combined with other : <a href="rivervale.asp">Rivervale /
    Misty Thicket</a> or <a href="skarana.asp">South Karana / Lair of Splitpaw</a>. As more
    quests are added these may be broken apart but for now it is easier to condense
    neighboring related areas.</p>
    <p align="left">A couple of things you should know about quests.</p>
    <p align="left">1. <span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Faction is very
    important</span>. I have found that in most cases it is the most important issue. It can
    determine if you even get a quest, if you get the followup quest - when available, and in
    many cases what sort of reward you are given. It can be very difficult to complete certain
    quests if you are on the wrong side of the faction lists with a certain group. Some quests
    are only faction based. Just watch those faction messages very closely. There are many
    quests that Ligge will never be able to personally confirm due to this reason. Even though
    I am willing to bet when it is all fisnished I will come close to completeing more than
    any one single traveller in Norrath. You want a challenge try to become friends with both
    sides of a an ongoing dispute to the point of warm or amiable status. It is not an easy
    task, just ask any evil race.</p>
    <p align="left">2. <span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Your level of experience
    is important</span>. There are some quest you can't get until you reach a certain level
    and others you can't complete once you have become too experienced. One bad note about
    this is there are a couple of quests, oh let's say Shakey the Scarecrow quests, that you
    are given at a young age, but are refused at an older age. I think this is probably a bug
    issue. The Shakey quests, for instance, I was given in my first season yet once I hit 19th
    and was more capable of completing the quests I was told I was too experienced. I about
    slapped Reebo.</p>
    <p align="left">Obviously, there is another time that this page is useful. If you didn't
    write down what Reebo told you 19 seasons ago you can find out what to do here.</p>
    <p align="left">3. <span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Quests change and are
    semi-dynamic</span>. Who I talk to may not always be who you talk to. I can't tell if this
    is world server dependent, random, or just one way Verant is making things less static.
    Sometime the name may change, but the quest actions are essentially the same. If you see
    something that has drastically changed concerning something I have here, <a href="mailto:ligge@eqguide.com?subject=Quest Updates">please tell me</a> and I will go
    confirm and edit the information.</p>
      <p align="left">4. <span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Always under
    construction</span>. As Norrath will be so will this page. Will I keep up? Not on your
    life, but I will do my best. I typically run through a town and
      &quot;Hail&quot; everyone and take notes. I try to get as far as I can or
      finish every quest that way. Then I use every resource I can to get background information
      on ones I missed or they wouldn't give me. The issue here is sometimes if
      the NPC won't give you the &quot;pass phrase&quot; you are stuck., but if
      you already know the &quot;pass phrase&quot; you can complete the quest. That takes a lot of time. Under each quest there is a line
    for &quot;confirmed&quot; this lets you know if I was able to complete it.</p>
    <p align="left">If I am not able to, I will always try, I will tell you how far I have
    gotten. If others have completed it and made that information available I will give it to
    you, but unless it has been confirmed I can only guess to it's validity. For quests I do
    not personally confirm I rely on various web sites, newsgroups, and
    listservs to provide you with as much truthful information I can. I can
    assure weeding through 1000 pieces of mail day is not the most enjoyable part of my day.</p>
    <p align="left">On that note, I hope this information is found useful. If not, oh well. I
    have had a great time trying to do all of them anyway.</p>
