    <p align="left">Ok the new website is now up and edits will be continuing!
    Come see the <a href="changingtide/default.htm" target="_top">Changing Tide</a>!</p>

    <p align="left">1/08/01<br>
    Yeah yeah yeah. I have some&nbsp; life again. Kis almost a year old and has
    been wearing me out, started a new job and all that fun stuff. As Ligge
    nears 55 and the face of Everquest has changed&nbsp; dramatically I have
    some renewed vigor. For the longest time everytime I sat down to writ
    anything I had nothing positive to say, well that has changed finally and I
    hope to go back to some of what I was trying to do with this site again.
    Please bare with me as I sort through and probably create broken links and
    such for a short time and I decide what stays and what comes forward.</p>
    <p align="center"><a href="images/spectread.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/spectread_small.jpg" alt="spectread.jpg (100425 bytes)" width="100" height="83"></a></p>
    <p align="center">Rarely do I post pictures sent in by others, but this one
    is worth a look...</p>
    <p align="left">And now the beginning of a new era... I have gotten behind
    again on updates, but it is because of all the changes in Norrath for me. We
    all know I got married. Well, now we have a guild. It is called Changing
    Tide. Cailette and I are co-leaders and some of our closest friends have
    jumped on with us. More will hopefully be signed up real soon. Spliner is
    working on our website and we will be using the same <a href="http://pub17.ezboard.com/beqguide" target="_top">message
    board</a> for the guild we have been using for events. Recent weeks have
    seen a great run in Hate, we went with Sacred Fyre and killed Phini in
    Kedge, we got me Efreeti boots and will continue to go back for more for
    everyone else. I won the first pair on a roll of 95. Wooohoo! Lots more is
    brewing and the fun is returning.</p>
    <p align="left">Well, and end of an era for me. We lost our ranger a while
    back due to frustration and other issues and&nbsp; slowly our team has been
    falling apart due to time issues mainly. Sacred Fyre has been nice enough
    to adopt Cailette on many of their excursions and has welcomed the rest of
    us into the events with open arms. Not really sure what would have happened
    if they hadn't. Today I got a nice letter from our former ranger and wanted
    to share. <a href="articlesold/wyrd.html">A Ranger's Dying Words</a>.</p>
    <p align="left">I have a quick favor to ask. I get quite a bit of traffic
    here each and everyday and if just 1% of you would send <a href="mailto:cailette@eqguide.com">Cailette</a>
    an email asking her to write more articles it would be a big help to me!
    Thanks! Also congratulate her on finally marrying the only man in Norrath
    that sees her as the most valuable loot he ever found. Me! We eloped this
    last week and I am a happy halfling now. Ok I am gonna go run off now
    because I know I am in the doghouse when she sees this update...</p>
    <p align="left">I have added review on the <a href="articles/mistmoore.html"> Castle
    Mistmoore</a>. Quite possibly
    my favorite zone in Norrath. I also added another the third page of <a href="photos/kunark1.htm">Kunark
    shots</a>.</p>
    <p align="left">Have you ever wondered just how bad that woman of yours<a href="articlesold/images/caiiksar.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/caiiksar_small.jpg" alt="caiiksar.jpg (33407 bytes)" align="right" width="100" height="75"></a> could look? Well I
    know... egads, waking up to this would be a fright! Thankfully, I know its
    only an illusion and she has many more pleasant ones she does like to use
    from time to time. Hey I married her didn't I?</p>
    <p align="left">For many months we have discussed the validity of running
    raids in places like the Planes and some of the tougher multi-group spots as
    independents. Many have said it can't be done and we would need to be
    guilded. Bah! I say! Well, the first attempt was on the 30th and I am sorry
    to say it went very badly, no deaths, but a lot of fighting and issues with
    a few guilds and I had to go out of town on short notice so Cailette had to
    step in and fill both our shoes. The past is the past and I am not going to
    rake people over the coals on this, nor are we giving up. I set up a <a href="http://pub17.ezboard.com/beqguide" target="_top">message
    board</a> for this purpose so we can stay in contact and organize the next
    runs. Efreeti is next and Hate again in a few weeks. Wish us luck. I intend
    to prove unguilded and smaller guilds can survive Norrath events with a
    little patience, effort, and friends! Emalythe of Inner Peace Fellowship is
    still working with Cailette and I to make this happen. I would like to thank
    everyone that helped and supported us that night.</p>
    <p align="left">Spliner has added his thoughts on spell line ups for upper
    levels and I have posted it here - <a href="articlesold/clericspellloading.html"> Cleric Spell Loading</a>.
    Enjoy. Cailette also sent me this site: <a href="http://eqphotos.eqrealms.com/" target="_blank">Everquest
    Player Photos</a>. I did send in my pics for Fennin. Be afraid, be very very
    afraid.</p>

    If you need a break from EQ and Norrath or just something to read while you
    await the next spawn, this book is the entire Douglas Adams series at once.
    It's a great series and a wonderful way to wait for Bilge to run by. Check
    out some other favorites in our <a href="books.html">bookstore</a>.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380809060/everquessucks"><img border="0" src="images/advertisers/amber.jpg" align="right" width="70" height="116">

    <p align="left"> While chatting about books recently with Cailette I recalled the
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380809060/everquessucks">Chronicles
    of Amber</a> series and happened to make a jaunt over to Amazon and I found
    the entire series of Amber in ONE book for $16.00. That's just too good to
    pass up!</p>
