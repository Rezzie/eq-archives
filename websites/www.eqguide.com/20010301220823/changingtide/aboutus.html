        <p align="center"><b><font color="#FFCC99" face="Tahoma" size="3">What is Changing Tide?</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#FFCC99" size="2" face="Tahoma"><i>Well I guess it is time to answer 
          a few questions I have been getting... </i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC99" face="Tahoma" size="2">Its a new guild formed by Cailette 
          and I. The idea behind our doing it was pretty simple. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC99" face="Tahoma" size="2">1) We wanted to provide a chat channel 
          to make some of our runs easier. <br>
          2) We have friends in every guild on the server and choosing one over 
          the other was just not going to happen. <br>
          3) We wanted to create a place where folks who believe that if you accept 
          the challenges of adventuring in Norrath, beating the odds and the baddies 
          is the reward. Folks who want to build a group of tight teams that KNOW 
          the others have their back. Folks who you know you are willing to die 
          for. Folks who want to explore all the nooks and cranies of this land 
          of ours. Those things being done, its a bonus if a nice trinket happens 
          to be found while doing that exploring.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC99" face="Tahoma" size="2"> If you have ever asked "can we 
          pull the rares to zone and pick them off" you probably don't belong 
          with us. If you were in a group with two mages and a + int item dropped 
          that they didn't have and could use and you suggested the warrior and 
          druid roll for it, you probably don't belong with us. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC99" face="Tahoma" size="2">I don't begin to assume I speak 
          for Cailette or anyone else in our new family, but I do know we all 
          think quite a bit alike. Personally I am tired of a lot of the "turf 
          war" type mentality. I am also tired of the "my Dad is bigger than your 
          Dad" attitude. I don't want to bicker or squabble or fight. I want to 
          have some fun without stomping on the fun of others. I want to treat 
          others the way I would like to be treated.... and have them treat me 
          the same way. Sheer numbers do not make you powerful and money does 
          not make you rich. Lewt most assuredly does not make you a respected 
          person. Friendship however, covers all 3 of those bases quite well. 
          Thats the most valuable thing we have in any life. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC99" face="Tahoma" size="2">Well those are a few of the things 
          that drove me to this point and this decision. We have no interest in 
          recruiting from current guilds. We have friends in every guild and we 
          want to keep those friends and build solid relationships with their 
          guilds as well. It is a scary road we have chosen to traverse and we 
          hope that these friends will help make the trip a little brighter. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC99" face="Tahoma" size="2">This will also make calendar events 
          easier as I can post as our guild rather than Ligge etc etc. Hopefully 
          we have both earned the respect and friendship of enough people that 
          it will continue and trickle down to the rest that unite with us. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC99" face="Tahoma" size="2">We often have wondered how we have 
          pulled off some of the feats we have in the past. Friendship, trust, 
          and loyalty have been the cause. We knew the other person wasn't going 
          to get greedy or careless due to an item drop. And we knew no one was 
          ever running and leaving party members behind. Sticking through some 
          tough times we have found a mix that makes it a joy to be in Norrath. 
          So now it is time we put this to the test on a larger scale. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC99" face="Tahoma" size="2">Thanks! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC99" face="Tahoma" size="2"><a href="mailto:ligge@eqguide.com">Ligge</a> 
          and <a href="mailto:cailette@eqguide.com">Cailette</a> </font></p>
        <p align="center"><b><font color="#FFCC99" face="Tahoma" size="3">Code
        of Conduct</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC99">Always remember
        the golden rule. Odds are good that if you wonldn't like someone
        doing/saying that to you, you shouldn't even be thinking about saying or
        doing it. Plus, you don't know who that person really is at the
        keyboard. I can't stress this enough. I have made some good friends as
        my youngins that have no idea they were talking to me. The reverse is
        also true.<br>
        <br>
        Guild chat should be rated PG 13. What is said in group is at groups
        discretion. There are people of all ages that will be part of our family
        and making someone feel uncomfortable due to language is just not a good
        thing.<br>
        <br>
        Please no guild bashing on any boards, /ooc /shout /say or even in
        /group. If you need to, use our private areas. Everyone needs a place to
        rant. Send me a tell and whine all you want. However, remember one bad
        incident shouldn't focus blame on a whole guild. Again, keep in mind you
        have no idea who that person is on the other side of the keyboard and
        what other life/lives they may lead in Norrath.<br>
        <br>
        Guild invites are, by design, reserved for Officers. Applicants need to
        be sponsored by at least one full member. Then they are discussed by all
        of us in the private forums. Officers report the vote of their team
        members. Final voting takes place in the Officer forum after all things
        have been considered.<br>
        <br>
        Please no power looting or no ninja looting. Everyone in your group
        deserves a fair share. Turn on split, take turns, whatever works best
        for everyone.<br>
        <br>
        Group loot should be awarded to or rolled by the appropriate classes and
        people present that will use them first. Senior Officer or group leader
        decides, guild tag has no bearing on the loot distribution. The people
        in the group putting their life on the line get 100% recognition for
        their efforts.<br>
        <br>
        Odds are strong that there will be no &quot;guild-only&quot; events. We
        have too many friends that we will want to include for that to happen.
        However, there may be a time when we all go somewhere after a meeting as
        a group. This would be a guild only event in some aspects, but others
        are always welcome to join at that time. We have and always will
        maintain friends in many guilds and these people should be treated as
        family as you would anyone wearing our tag.<br>
        <br>
        Disputes need to be taken up with your Officer if you can not handle it
        amongst yourself. If you don't feel comfortable speaking with your
        Officer then take it up with another or one of the Guild leaders.<br>
        <br>
        Over all we oppose power leveling. Touchy subject and open to discretion
        to get over a frustrating bubble or two. However, a caster who doesn't
        know the range and depth of their spells or a meleer who doesn't have
        important skills maxed tend to be more of a danger to their team than an
        aid. It would be a disservice to your friends, groups and guild to be
        one of these types. Advice on hunting grounds and different dungeons
        will be always be given to help those levels and skills fly by.<br>
        <br>
        You should always give everyone the benefit of a doubt once. Screw me
        once shame on you, screw me twice shame on me. If you suspect you have
        been mistreated or you have seen foul play always try to see the other
        side of the issue first.<br>
        <br>
        You are 100% accountable for anything your character does. Anything they
        do is a reflection on us as a whole. This includes shared accounts or
        the sharing of accounts. It happens and that's fine, but please remember
        that if they mess up and give you a bad name and therefore the guild,
        you are the one that faces those consequences.</font></p>
