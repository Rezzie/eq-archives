    <p align="left">Welcome back! As the first edition of the new site I have
    tried to do a some cleanup of articles and add some new ones. Some of the old articles still need to be
    revised and each edition I will redo a couple. So here is what we have this round.</p>
    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/leaf.gif" align="left" width="20" height="21">Ligge's <a href="hitlist.htm">Hit List</a>
    was updated as
    well as a <a href="hitlist2.htm">second one</a> begun.</p>
    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/leaf.gif" align="left" width="20" height="21"><a href="brewing.html">Brewing
    </a>was
    written when brewing was profitable. &lt;laughs&gt; It's revised and
    includes the trivialities of them now also.</p>
    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/leaf.gif" align="left" width="20" height="21">The <a href="animals.html">charm</a>
    article has been slightly edited with some more pictures and a few notes.</p>
    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/leaf.gif" align="left" width="20" height="21">Still
    the most popular articles day after day are my rant on <a href="customerservice.html">Customer
    Service</a> and <a href="gimme.html">Gimme Gimme</a>. They remain
    essentially unedited.</p>
    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/leaf.gif" align="left" width="20" height="21"><a href="philosophy.htm">Philosophy</a>,
    <a href="evercamp.htm">Evercamp</a>, <a href="druidspells1-19.htm">Druid
    Spells 1-19</a> and <a href="fishing.html"> fishing</a> articles got a few brush ups.</p>
    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/leaf.gif" align="left" width="20" height="21">Midlevel druid quest armor
    must be coming! I saw an elephant fly!</p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/elephantfly.jpg" width="620" height="465"></p>
    <p align="left"><u>What's coming?<br>
    </u>I still need to go back and look at more of the older articles.
    As we grow older we tend to grow wiser and hopefully I have learned even
    more since I started this site a year ago.</p>
    <p align="left">The location list needs to be redone and completed and I am
    trying to find the best way to handle this issue. Zone reviews are being
    thought about with each article accompanied by the important locations in
    that zone.</p>
    <p align="left">Quest information is still up in the air. I have a link here
    to the old probably buggy pages now until I decide. <a href="../quests/default.asp" target="_blank">Everquest Quests</a></p>
    <p align="left">Rants - well as we grow older we also get more cynical and I
    have seen some of the biggest assholes in Norrath too many times to keep my
    tongue tied as long as I have. There are a few that need to be pointed out,
    blacklisted, and basically ran out of Norrath.</p>
