    <p align="center">The people of Norrath I intend to go back for</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">One of the greatest advantages to being a druid is the aspect of traveling
    and meeting new people. Both friends and enemies. Eventually the difficulty becomes
    keeping tract of the myriad of enemies you need to follow up on and enact vengeance. Over
    time I have had, shall we say, incidents with quite a few folks across Norrath and have
    vowed payback to each and everyone of them. As the list grows and gets completed I will
    update this list.</p>
    <p align="left">As of March 1, 2000 there are only 4 people left on my original
    hit list. Zixx, Guard Huatian, Varsoon, and Hycallan. Huatian still has a little bit
    of luck on his side as of his location and what I will have to endure to
    beat him as he roams the middle of Felwithe like a coward. The other three seem to hide quite often, but are surely dead the second I see them. Due to
    this fact I have begun work on the second <a href="hitlist2.htm"> Hit List</a>.</p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>1. Nillipuss</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">That little obnoxious brownie that runs around Rivervale stealing jum jum
    from my beloved Stormreapers. Reebo Leefsway is interested in retrieving the jum jum
    stalks Nillipuss has taken and Deputy Hiltop has a well known fascination with the little
    thief, well he did until he heard the Ogre in the vale rumors... Nillipuss was annoying
    enough that I attacked him numerous times in my younger days just so he would know who I
    was when I came back to eliminate him.<font color="#000080"> I am happy to say I tend to
    kill Nillipuss every other day now. If he happens to be run around Rivervale as I pass
    through, he can count himself dead. I began taking him near the end of my 15th season.</font></p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>2. Ambassador D'Vinn</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">This man was a major thorn in my side when visiting my fellow druids near
    Crushbone, in Greater Faydark. During my visit we took a stroll into Crushbone, the hall
    of the orcs, and unhappily enough spent quite sometime tangling with the slimy Tier'Dal
    Ambassador D'Vinn. Rumor has it he is helping coordinate efforts between the orcs and the
    Tier'Dal against the fine people of Faydark. Soon I will be traveling back to Crushbone to
    repay that debt to both D'Vinn and his pal Crushbone. It is long overdue. <font color="#000080">What
    a wuss! It's scary to think one day I was scared of this guy. I took an
    afternoon off and sat in the tower and pop Crush and D'Vinn for a while
    letting the younger folks look the tunics and extra dirks.</font></p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>3. Guard Hutian</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">This busy body needs a lesson. While casually fishing on the riverbank in
    the town of Felwithe I made a careless error. Maybe it was the new brew I was working on
    or just silly halfling antics, regardless I happened to target my partner and give her a
    little Flame Lick. Without hesitation Guard Hutian took me down and left me bleeding on
    the banks. No questions asked, no response required. How did he know she didn't like it?
    We all know what enchanters are like behind closed doors...</p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>4. Mino Hero</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">If you have ever hunted the minotaur caves in Steamfont Mountains or know
    someone that has you know of this beast. Seemingly unstoppable he rampages out of the
    caves and slays everything he can touch without consideration or remorse. That is exactly
    how he will be treated when I get to him. There is a <a href="../photos/photos2.htm">picture</a>
    in the photo gallery of this huge beast. <font color="#000080">This beast is
    part of the Hero Bracers quest from the Steel Warriors.I am happy to say he
    has died both times I recently saw him.</font></p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>5. Lord Shin Ree</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">He is related in some way to the Deathfist Orcs. I have yet to find their
    homebase, but one day I will and I will hunt him down. We met on what was to be a simple
    hunting expedition into West Commons to slay some orcs to assist my hometown of Rivervale
    and earn are squad rings. On our way from Freeport I got to close to the orc camping area,
    too curious as usual, and out of blue Lord Shin Ree arrived. It was a nastily quick battle
    and ever since then I have been looking for the orcish demon to get even. <font color="#000080">He is dead!
    WooHoo! What a glorious night it was! First Lord Shin Ree,
    then a Neriak guard, and THEN a werewolf. Of course the testosterone was high and Cailette
    and I went after Kizdean, bad move... the day before I would begin my 19th season I
    finished Ree off, there is a <a href="../photos/photos3.htm">picture in gallery</a>.</font></p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>6. Kizdean Gixx</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">This undeserving Tier'Dal wanders through West Commons on a regular basis.
    The fine folks in my homeland have again asked me to assist in ridding the surrounding
    areas of vermin and he is one of the bugs that needs to be pushed back to
    Neriak. It is
    very obvious the Tier'Dal have only black and white. Either they are a great help and have
    been banished from their land or they are dark and deceitful like this one. Darkness will
    be the last thing Gixx sees I can promise you that. <font color="#000080">Another one
    bites the dust! On the night of June 22nd, after a raucous battle with a werewolf, Ligge
    enlisted the assistance of a roaming kodiak and finally taught Kizdean a lesson.</font> I
    have an article on <a href="animals.html">charming animals</a> that includes a picture of
    the first time I killed Gixx with a kodiak partner.</p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>7. Varsoon</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">He charmed me!!! That is one thing I will not stand for! I know nothing of
    this human necromancer's story, but one incident. He was guarding multiple corpses in the
    ruins of Qeynos Hills, prevent people from retrieving the bodies, so I offered to help. I
    was able to get his attention and make him chase me to the guards at Surefall Glade's
    entrance. The cowards did nothing! They stood and watched Varsoon and his pet beat on me
    and then charm me as his own little evil doer. It is unfortunate Varsoon did not have the
    sense to turn me on the worthless guards.&nbsp; <font color="#000080">I have
    tried to kill this guy for a while now. He just spawns so infrequently it's
    an absolute waste of my time.</font></p>
    <h5 align="left"><b><font size="3" color="#800000">8. Hycallan</font></b></h5>
    <p align="left">Women are normally not something I would include on this sort of list. I
    thoroughly enjoy the company of women, except this one did not return the affection. I was
    simply strolling through Lavastorm Mountains and found a goblin camp. Within one of their
    tents was an attractive female and I decided to free her from her confinement. As soon as
    I began to pummel the 3 goblin guards she cast a spell and summoned a pet... skeleton... a
    necro, and a Erudite at that. Not someone that looked at me too fondly as I tried to slay
    her guards...</p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>9. Dorn B'Dynn</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">Another of the Tier'dal brethren. He hangs out with some Dervish Thugs and
    Cutthroats in Northern Desert of Oasis. As a young chap I took a stroll a little too close
    to his tent on my first adventure in the Northern Ro and he persuaded me to leave for
    quite a while. I am back and checking up on him daily. He will probably be the next to
    feel the wrath of Ligge. <font color="#000080">Well, I finally did go back and get this
    worthless drow, what a waste of mana! He was a wuss by the time I came back through here
    and Cailete and I took him with minimal effort. Next time he might think twice about
    picking on a little halfing. As he hung out eating scarab dung and cheating at cards with
    his cutthroat friends Ligge got stronger...</font></p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>10. Broon</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">Big cyclops that bathes, continually as he should, in the river of East
    Karanas. He was a major nemesis for this fledgling druid trying to explore the world. Now
    he is a nuisance to be avoided. Soon he will be fish food. Last time I saw him he was
    fighting others and stopped to take a swing at me. Aye, Broon, I understand, you know I am
    coming back for you one day! Go ahead and get all the swings in now my friend. <font color="#000080">Come and get me big boy! We have had a blast running Broon all around East
    Karana lately. I am not very succesful solo yet, but with a partner or two we can ping
    pong him back and forth between us and have a ball. Snare, DOTs, and balst from all angle
    keeps this guys confused and disoriented.</font></p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>11. Dragoon Zytl</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">Another evil Tier'Dal roaming the West Commons area. He seems to be most
    frequently found near the large pyramid structure and waters edge. Obviously I have no
    love for most Tier'Dal as Zytl makes the 4th on this hit list of mine. Maybe one day I can
    help lead the deserving Tier'dal in a raid upon Neriak and erase the evil that continues
    to spawn and fester in that dark place. <font color="#000080">Zytl has been
    paid back and will many times in the future. A word of advice, don't kill
    Zytl and sit around too long. We were low on mana and low health and Kizdean
    showed up and wiped the floor with me. Its almost funny. I guess ole greenie
    Kizdean has me on his hitlist too.</font></p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>12. Lord Grimrot</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">A sorrowful shadowknight residing in South Karanas. I had no beef with
    this guy, I feel sorry for anyone that has to create his own girlfriends... (he has a
    quest for evil types to go bring her remains back so he can reanimate them) I only wanted
    a <a href="../photos/photos4.htm">picture of him</a> and his opal scythe. Well, I got it
    the picture, and he got me... this time! Next time he will not be so lucky. <font color="#000080">This
    smelly puke is deceased. I even kept his scythe as a memento of the
    triumphant victory.</font></p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>13. Findlegrob</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">If anyone deserves the position of 13th it is this one. Some little twerpy
    gnome necro in the Rathe Mountains surprised me with his little gathering of groupies (2
    iced bone skeletons, 2 dry boned skeletons, zombies, his pet and him - plus a Giant
    Skeleton nearby tagged me as I ran). I can assure you without the element of surprise he
    will not get another chance. <font color="#000080">Another mark in my belt!! When Cailette
    and I went back here I was determined to get even. We did. He did kill me as he got off a
    Heat Blood as I struck the final blow and neither cailette or myself had any opportunity
    to save me as my life drained away after Findle fell.</font></p>
    <h5 align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000"><b>14. Zixx Nenix</b></font></h5>
    <p align="left">What is the deal with Tier'dals and me? I have a few friends of that race
    that are wonderful, but it seems most are despicable. This annoyance roams Splitpaw when
    released from his hold and seems to always find me. He doesn't ever hurt much, but I can't
    seem to do much damage to his evil hide before I have to flee. Maybe he didn't like it
    when I offered to show him that black heart I carry around, or maybe it was the dark elf
    parts he smelled stinking up my bag... there is also a <a href="../photos/photos4.htm">picture
    in the gallery</a>.</p>
