    <p align="left">There is at least one quest not listed here due to the lack of information
    and maybe a lack of a quest. I see runners that say they are in a race against the
    paladins of the Temple of Life. Kobot Dellin seems to be the most common, but I have seen
    others. I have actually got him to tell me he needs a favor. When I asked what he took off
    and ran. Anyone know what this is about?</p>

    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments:</span> Rabid Lempeck Hargrin
    stands on the top of a house in West Karana near the waters edge, just east of Miller's
    farm area. Most people tend to talk to him out of curiousity and get this plea for help.
    However, if you are friends with the crazy Rodcet Nife worshippers, do you know they pray
    to a fish??, this quest may be given by Astaed Wemor in the Temple of Life of Qeynos.</p>
    <p align="left">Now you must see Astaed, in the Temple of Life, and he will tell you that
    you need some <a target="_self" href="rivervale.asp#Honey Jum">Honey Jum</a> before he can
    assist you. To get Honey Jum you must travel to Misty Thicket and get some honeycombs and
    see Kizzie Mintopp. This is actually part of many quests and you need to go there to see
    what to do.</p>
    <p align="left">Once you have the Honey Jum go back to the Temple and trade it for potion
    for Lempeck. Due to my feeding on their God (I keep eating Koalindl fish) he snagged my
    Honey Jum and shafted me. However, form other sources I understand you take the potion to
    Lempeck and get a &quot;lore item&quot; scythe that goes back to Temple. This exchanges
    for a nonlore item weapon or the Shining Star of Light. If something different happens to
    you let me know. I doubt I will ever have good enough faction with these guys. I assure
    you I have tried.</p>

    <p align="left"><span class="qinfo">Description and Comments: </span>Find Yiz Pon and
    strike up a conversation with him. Do not waste time looking around once you start talking
    or you will not get the information needed. Keep the conversation going and get all that
    you cna out of him as a Splitpaw Assassin is nearby and will interrupt you if you are not
    careful. Once the assassin shows up Yiz is gone. If you get a chance to talk he will send
    you to se his brother, Hyrill, with a note. His brother was trying to get this caster's
    item and Yiz had the skull portion for him. Since he was being chased he gave the skull up
    to the assassin, but the assassin has continued to hunt him down. You must kill the
    assassin and go see the brother with the skull.</p>
    <p align="left">Now you need the eyes. I have yet to complete this part. The ruby eyes are
    in 2 location as I have been told. Lyunga in Innothule Swamp and Kurrpok a shaman in
    Splitpaw. Of course, Kurrpok shares a rooom with my buddy Zixx so until I am ready for
    revenge I am not going back to that hell hole.</p>

    to have a shipment of lion meat delivered to Tiera O'Dannus in Halas. Fortunately, I got
    the meat (of course it poofed for no reason and another petition went
    unanswered) from her before my faction went bad. Killing Frostbite to improve faction with Temple of Life and get a Koalindl fish
    for Barkeep's Compendium and or Temple's quest has been hazardous.</p>
