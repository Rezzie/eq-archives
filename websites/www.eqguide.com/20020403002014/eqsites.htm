      <p align="left">This is not necessarily in any order. There are 100's of
      sites available to Norrathian adventurers on the web and in an effort to
      cut down on the fluff I have listed the sites I currently find most useful
      and why. There are other sites out there and as I find myself using them
      more often they will get posted here and others may be removed. Why list
      50 sites when 6 do the job.</p>

      Player Photos</font></a><font size="2">:<br>
      </font>This site offers no redeeming value at all. It is actual player
      pictures of people on each server. Click at your own risk.</p>
      <p><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/" target="_top"><font size="2">AllaKhazam's
      Magical Realm</font></a>:<br>
      Here is something that Yahoo proved a long time ago.. you don't have to
      look good to be useful. However he has improved it dramatically over time.
      Lots of quest information provided, I venture to say more than any other
      site. It is player submitted information so I do find some errors from
      time to time, but it is still very useful. Many other topics are covered,
      most are links to other sites that have the information. He also has a
      nice level chart on where is good to hunt based on your level. That's nice
      when you get bored and have run out of ideas on where to take your party
      tonight.</p>

      </font><b><u>Other equipment sites:</u></b> <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com">Caster's
      Realm</a><br>
      A very nice searchable guide to equipment. This comes to us as a partner
      of <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq">EQ'Lizer</a>. As an all inclusive
      site EQ'Lizer does a good job and has more pictures of items than
      AllaKhazam's, however AllaKhazam seems to have the most quests available.
      With the inclusion of the item database this definitely is a good place to
      check. The quest database at EQ'Lizer is nice too, however I didn't find
      it any more useful than AllKhazam's &quot;Yahoo&quot; approach.</p>
      <p><font size="2"><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com">EQMaps</a><br>
      </font><b><u>Other map sites</u></b>: <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com">EQAtlas</a>,
      <a href="http://www.everlore.com">Everlore</a>, <a href="http://users.telepak.net/~rickyh/mapsbyho.htm">Maps
      by Hop</a><font size="2"><br>
      </font>The best place for maps in my opinion. Yes, he did take them from
      everywhere else, but he deserves some credit for getting the best maps all
      in one place. He does give credit for to the creators also and has done a
      service to us by putting them all in one spot. The information has gotten
      a lot better over the last year or so and a place I check often.</p>

      This used to be EQ Enchanters and was a great site for enchanters and
      jewelry information! Baelish keeps adding and expanding, now he even has
      equipment information. Some information is incomplete, like most web
      sites, but they do a very good job. An exceptional bonus is their wisdom
      and intelligence based mana calculators to see comparisons of what a
      wisdom or intelligence enhancing item really gives you in mana depending
      on your level. The ini editor and the stats/character file area is great
      too. Great job!</p>

      </font>Druid one stop message board stop. Died for a while, but with SoV
      we all came back it seems.&nbsp; As any boards we have a few trolls,
      *waves to Goss* but it seems to be kept relatively on check. If anyone
      knows of a decent listserv that is Druid related; plus fairly active and
      not filled with powergamers, whiners, flamers, animal killers, and other
      blasphemers *smile* please let me know. Thanks! <a href="mailto:ligge@eqguide.com">Ligge</a>
