      <p>I've recently re-written this article. I wrote it back when I was level
      39, and the spell loads have changed since then as I have learned many
      things. Life at level 50 is a bit different than it was back then, and I
      wish I knew some of the things I know now, back then. So here you go,
      enjoy!</p>
      <p>Having spent well over 100 of my real life days playing EverQuest, I'd
      like to say I always am prepared. That's not exactly true, but I do my
      best to keep the right supplies ready for myself as well as my teammates,
      that includes spell loads for different situations. Currently I am level
      50 (about two bubbles shy of level 51), and I spend my days traveling with
      a druid, enchanter, and a ranger, as well as pickup clerics and other
      tanks, druids, and bards. Luckily the team I adventure with are all well
      seasoned, and I have complete trust in their abilities. Having said that,
      below are situations and spell loads I use to live in Norrath safely, and
      I hope other clerics old and new will find this information useful.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Traveling!</p>
      </b>
      <p>Ok, I'm level 50, so lets face it, outside of Kurnak and the planes; I
      worry about few dangers from traveling afoot in Norrath. However, with the
      new world come new dangers, and many that could make me into a meal in
      very short order. We have eight spell slots, and although I find that's
      usually enough, we always wish we had more available. Making good use of
      them in traveling situations makes sense IMHO.</p>
      <p>I use the following configuration for traveling long distances on foot
      in the dangerous lands of Kurnak:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1-Greater Healing<br>
        2-Invoke Fear<br>
        3-Panic the Dead<br>
        4-Root<br>
        5-Force<br>
        6-Banish Undead<br>
        7-Retribution<br>
        8-Divine Aura</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now, I'll explain something. In Kurnak I don't travel without SoW. If I
      can't get a SoW by offering a nice druid some of my buffs in return, then
      I'll use a potion. If the day comes when I can't buy potions, and when I
      can't get a SoW from a druid or shaman or ranger, then I'll go spend my
      time making a shaman character to make my own SoW potions. It's that
      simple. Without SoW if I run into something nasty, my chances of
      out-running it are pretty slim. I always carry a couple of invis potions,
      water breath potions, and SoW potions with me. Below are why I choose the
      spells I choose:</p>
      <p>Greater Healing - It casts fast, heals me almost two bubbles of health,
      which is enough to run at full speed with SoW. If I run into something I
      want to kill and not avoid, I can always root and swap it to superior
      software.</p>
      <p>Invoke Fear - This should be obvious, if I can't kill it, or don't want
      to, I'll fear it and leave.</p>
      <p>Panic the Dead - Used in the same manner as Invoke Fear, however it
      lasts two times as long on undead =)</p>
      <p>Root - Yes, level 9 root. It's the best root spell in the game, and
      lasts just as long as immobilize and enstill. It casts faster than enstill
      and immobilize, I can get it off in a fight every time, and it allows you
      to do damage to the mob with less of a chance of breaking, unlike enstill
      and immobilize which will break almost immediately if you do damage.</p>
      <p>Force - 5-sec stun @ 90 damage. If it's a fast hitter and I need it out
      of my face, I can usually get this stun off, even if it's just long enough
      to root the critter and run.</p>
      <p>Banish Undead - 585 damage undead. Low mana requirements, long cast
      time. Unless I want to kill the undead critter, I won't use it just for
      traveling, but I keep this and Retro up just in case.</p>
      <p>Retribution - Used in the same manner as Banish, it's here if I need it
      or want it. 516 DD spell, VERY slow casting.</p>
      <p>Diving Aura - Yep, about 5 seconds of invulnerability with a cast time
      of 1.0! If I need it, it's there, it won't last long but it gives me time
      to put some distance between the mob and myself for a quick heal.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Fighting Non-Undead solo.</p>
      </b>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1- Greater heal<br>
        2- Superior Heal<br>
        3- Root<br>
        4- Invoke Fear<br>
        5- Force<br>
        6- Sound of Force<br>
        7- Wrath<br>
        8- Retribution</p>
      </blockquote>
      <b>
      <p>Fighting Undead Solo.</p>
      </b>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1- Greater Healing<br>
        2- Root<br>
        3- Panic the Dead<br>
        4- Force<br>
        5- Sound of Force<br>
        6- Banish Undead<br>
        7- Retribution (just in case)<br>
        8- Divine Barrier</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>(Notice I dropped sheal, I don't need it for myself, as long as I have
      stuns and manna I shouldn't be getting hurt badly. A cleric who can't solo
      something undead, has a serious flaw in his gameplay =))</p>
      <b>
      <p>Fighting in a Group (Mix of Undead and Non-Undead)</p>
      </b>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1- Greater heal<br>
        2- Superior Heal<br>
        3- Word of Health<br>
        4- Force or Complete Heal (If I am tank heavy in the group I’ll swap
        force for CHeal)<br>
        5- Sound of Force<br>
        6- Banish Undead<br>
        7- Retribution<br>
        8- Divine Barrier or Root (If I have someone snaring or mezzing I don't
        use root)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now, these spell loads I have found efficient for fighting blue
      critters at level 45-50. Some are level 44 and 49 spells, so if you're
      lower than 44 or 49, adapt each spell with your best version and give it a
      try. Everyone has a different playstyle. Mine is not necessarily best for
      you, but it does work for my group and me. Here are a few tips:</p>
      <p>1) Always buff your party. You can add a fair amount of HP and AC to
      your party without reagents. If you don't, you're just going to spend more
      time healing and be out of manna at a crucial moment. If you keep your
      group buffed, and they continue to pull when you have no manna, you might
      want to think about finding another group.</p>
      <p>2) Cleric buffs are going to eat all your manna, and possibly part of
      another bar of manna if you're buffing a full group. Make sure you let the
      party know they won't be getting heals during this time, at least then if
      you're with a bunch of greedy idiots who think because they are full
      health they can take on the world, you won't feel bad about having to
      resurrect them later =)</p>
      <p>3) Always buff yourself first! That way if your buffs are wearing off,
      they'll be wearing off on the party next. You'll know when to rebuff
      instead of having to be told.</p>
      <p>Spell loads are one thing, cleric tactics are another. I'll try not to
      get too much into cleric tactics in this guide, but I wanted to add those
      few tips. Enjoy!</p>
