    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">As anyone that knows Ligge already is aware I abhor animal killers, but on
    the other hand they are great druidic partners. If and ONLY if, their death serves a
    greater good then I feel it is acceptable and Karana would be proud of our joint
    accomplishment. Now that does not mean you can go kill bears and cats for their hides, but
    it does open other doors. There are a couple of spells that make animal death almost a
    necessity. Befriend and Charm animal as well as their host of complimentary spells for
    finding and buffing are prime examples..</p>
    <p align="left">The argument has been presented to me a couple of times now that certain
    &quot;animals&quot; are freaks of nature and are therefore acceptable hunting prey for any
    reason, frogloks, aviaks, centaurs and griffon family have all been presented as being of
    that category. You be your own judge there.</p>
      <p align="left">However, if a kodiak is in my service and dies while slaying a werewolf or
    a bunch of Dervish Cutthroats I do believe any druidic<img border="0" src="images/gixbear.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155"> ethical issues are fairly resolved.
    The kodiak has helped to protect Norrath from a much more vile creature that has
    and will killed many of their own kindred. I only use kodiaks, and other friendly animals,
    when it is absolute necessity to rid Norrath of our target. The first time I killed
    Kizdean Gix was with a kodiak and the assistance of the squad ring.</p>
    <p align="left">I tend to solo quite a bit, hunting down quests or just practice tactics
    and skills in to the wee hours of the morning, and with many druid spells it is important
    to have a tank. Anything that requires a long casting period it is almost essential.
    Careless Lightning is a GREAT spell but in the beginning is very hard to get off in melee,
    as is Cascade of Hail and even Invoke Lightning with 3 ghouls beating on you. You need a
    tank! So go get one...</p>
    <p align="left">There is almost no greater thrill than befriending a griffawn and sending
    it in after a pack of ghouls!</p>
    <p align="left">The griffawn has a magical attack and does lots of damage, even more so if
    you use Feral Spirit on him to buff him up. You can cast Befriend Animal, Feral Spirit
    both on pet. Target your prey and send pet in after it. As pet moves forward you can now
    Swarm the target.</p>
    <p align="left">In most cases pet will meet the prey as they charge you and stop their
    progress. If it is multiple targets most will stay on your pet and you can now cast
    Cascade of Hail or Swarm the others. Now MEDITATE!</p>
    <p align="left">There is essentially 3 possibilities from here.</p>
    <p align="left">1. Pet will slay one or all targets and come back to protect you.</p>
    <p align="left">2. Targets will kill your pet and come after you.</p>
    <p align="left">3. Pet will turn and all or remaining prey will join pet and attack you.</p>
    <p align="left">Let's take them one at a time.</p>
      <p align="left">1. Not a problem at all. You have taken no damage, in most cases, and have
    been meditating back mana for this issue. So you can either: if the fight was fast go
    after another target, sit and wait for pet to turn and recast befriend, sit and wait for
    pet to turn and kill it, gate or run to zone so pet doesn't attack and you don't have to
    fight it.</p>
      <p align="left">If there is ample prey and you feel comfortable with your new pet I would
    wait and recast befriend on him after he turns. Keep this circle going as long as you can
    and enjoy yourself. Always remember to keep mana available for a quickly turned and upset
    pet. Even a griffawn that looks to be below me does a lot of damage when he turns on me.
    If you decide to kill it that is up to you and sometimes unavoidable. At least by the time
    you can befriend griffawns safely you have Dizzying Wind and can root and take them out
    fairly easily.</p>
    <p align="left">2. If the prey kills your pet, most often result and most preferable if
    you play this right, you shouldn't be too worried. The pet has normally killed a few if it
    was a group and if not has beaten it down enough for you and your meditated mana to finish
    them off. If not, by all means, you have SoW! RUN! Plus you no longer have to worry about
    the guilt from killing the animal. They served a minion of Karana well and are a credit to
    their race. On a side note.. since I have been befriending and hunting with griffawns
    their parental griffins no longer attack me or scowl at me. I can sit right under one as
    it flies over... no explanation for it, just an observation.<img border="0" src="images/grifffriend.jpg" align="left" width="206" height="155"></p>
    <p align="left">3. Well, this will happen sometimes. You have 2-3 seconds to decide if you
    can win. Make the call and stick with it. If you aren't sure... RUN! To prevent training
    them to resting zone points be aware of where others normally sit and rest or have gate
    loaded. Run a bit away and gate out. This saves your fellow hunters from having to deal
    with your mess and is the right thing to do.</p>
    <p align="left">Ok, so what is the first cast of Befriend fails? Similar as above for #3.
    You have 2-3 seconds to decide: a) run b) fight c) recast. I give most attempts 2 tries.
    If second fails they are already on me and I run, root and kill. Or run, root, and
    run/gate. In most cases I get success the first time.</p>
    <p align="left">The key to this tactic is threefold.</p>
    <p align="left">1. Know your limitations!</p>
    <p align="left">2. Know your pet's limitations!</p>
    <p align="left">3. Know your targets abilities!</p>
    <p>The biggest advantage in my eyes is I always have a tank when I need one. Maybe big and
    furry or feathery, but a tank nonetheless. There have been a number of hunts I have
    partaken that I could never have completed without my animal friends. They have been
    instrumental in a number of battles - multiple ghouls versus a griffawn, undead reavers
    against griffawns, kodiaks against cutthroats, kodiaks against werewolves, and the list
    goes on and on...</p>
    <p>Another nice treat is charming one that is attacking you or your group. They
    immediately stop and behave and no one is hurt and now you have a temporary tank. A prime
    example that many people have seen me pull is in the Karanas. Fighting bandits, reavers,
    and others it is not uncommon for a patriarch lion or gorge hound and other roamers to
    jump in and help your prey. No problem! Make friends with the beast and watch him help you
    out now! I get questions every time someone sees me do this, it is great fun.</p>
    <p>One suggested improvement I would have, is to make a befriended animal permanent, with
    restrictions, while in that zone. Like an animated pet that other casters have. They
    aren't going to live forever anyway. If that is too much than make restrictions on the
    &quot;permanent pet&quot;. For example, if a the pet is my level or close to - within 5
    levels - then make them behave as the do now. If the pet is 10 levels lower make them
    permanent with maybe a higher first cast fail rate and DEVOTED loyalty. One problem with
    lower pets is they won't attack something too strong for them. That is just wrong. A pet
    should guard his master with his life! Under all circumstances!</p>
    <p>A permanent pet 10 levels lower will not do much in fighting assistance, but would be a
    great guard as you meditated or healed and you set them to guard you. They may die quickly
    if a strong creature arrives, but it should give you the time to get up and attack or run.
    Under this idea you could also have a pet sit and not fight if so ordered while you
    battled things he could not. That way you still have your meditate guard, a<img border="0" src="images/shark.jpg" align="left" width="206" height="155"> friendly more
    cuddly version of the Sentient spell if I do say so myself.</p>
    <p>I get a lot of mail on this and as many people have taken the pet commands for granted.
    I am reviewing them here for a little more accuracy. They do not all work like regular
    commands. A special thank you also goes out to Faloniar (Wood Elf Druid on Mithaniel Marr)
    as she has been trying these out too and we have been confirming and sharing our results.</p>
    <font SIZE="2"><p></font>/pet attack - attacks the current target</p>
    <p>/pet guard me - guards you and your vicinity</p>
    <p>/pet guard here - guards the designated spot</p>
    <p>/pet follow me - loyally follows you around</p>
    <p>/pet back off - tells the pet to stop its attack</p>
    <p>Special note on the rest of these: If a pet quits responding to your commands, which
    they do after most of these commands below, it tends to walk off and start roaming again.
    About 50% of the time they come back and attack when charm finally breaks. I personally
    believe that the reason some don't is the charm breaks and others end up killing it before
    it finds you or you are too far away for it to &quot;see&quot; you. Just going by my
    experience. The developers basically don't acknowledge these commands for druid pets.</p>
    <p><a name="/pet as you were">/pet as you were</a> - begins acting like a normal animal
    again</p>
    <p>** If an animal attacks you or someone in your group try this: Charm or Befriend beast,
    pull him a ways from where you are all resting, make him /pet sit, walk back to your
    group, now do /pet as you were. You need to be close enough to here the pets response for
    this to work so far. Pet should turn around and go off playing now. Keep in mind at NO
    time did anyone attack the animal. It attacked I befriended. Tried with 100%&nbsp; success
    on multiple bears and cats so far.</p>
    <p>/pet get lost - same</p>
    <p>/pet sit down - same, except he does respond to you when you give it</p>
    <p>/pet stand up - pointless, since it stopped listening when you said sit down </p>
    <p>/pet report health - pointless<img border="0" src="images/gorillas.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155"></p>
    <p>Ok, I may regret this one as it can be abused, but I found a really fun thing to do
    with a charmed pet... hey its my opinion, we each have our own ideas of fun don't we?</p>
    <p>This came out of a problem in Misty Thicket when an Ogre was running around killing the
    guards. He was leaving the new residents without any assistance at the wall. As a proud
    member of both the Wall Guardians and Leatherfoot Raiders I found it necessary to help my
    fellow halflings, but I couldn't do it alone... so I grabbed a fresh kodiak out of the
    Thicket and brought him back to the guard post. If the pet is charmed the guards, when
    they are there, will not kill it. You can walk freely back and forth past them without any
    problems.</p>
    <p>Taking the position of a guard and leaving my kodiak out a bit to give me time to
    recast charm, if it broke I didn't want a guard (if he was reincarnated) to get it before
    I was able to recast, I was able to save many a fleeing halfling that came running for our
    missing guards. If more than one came I could send the bear after one target and grab the
    other myself.</p>
    <p>Keep that in mind you foul smelling Ogres! There are many Guardians of the Vale you can
    not harm and we are watching you.</p>
    <p>Maybe the Neriak enchanter crowd should take notice of this tactic, considering I tend
    to leave them without bridge guards quite often. *giggles*<img border="0" src="images/petmonkey.jpg" align="left" width="206" height="155"></p>
    <p>So what is fun about it? Well, go grab yourself a wolf and bring him into the
    city at
    your leisure. The looks and comments you get will be hilarious. No one has ever seen an
    animal get past the guards it seems. However, if charm breaks near a guard inside the city
    your pet will be dead quickly if you are not fast enough. No need to slaughter pets
    pointlessly so please be careful with our animal friends.</p>
    <p>Some ideas on where and what, by no means does it include them all, just
    some ones I have found fun:<br>
    East Karanas - griffawns, lions, and various dogs<br>
    North Karana - griffawns, griffennes, griffons<br>
    South Karana - elephants<br>
    West Commons - bears, cats, griffons<br>
    Misty Thicket - bears<br>
    Cazic Thule - crocs and gorillas<br>
    Kedge - lots of various fishes<br>
    SplitPaw - Wide Mouth Snakes, forget the name<br>
    Solusek B - sonic bats</p>
    <p>If I missed any obvious ones, besides the various wolf and bear spots,
    please let me know and I will add them here.</p>
