    <p align="left">Excerpt from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345340426/everquessucks">Lord of the Rings</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">'He is, as you have seen him,&quot; she said in answer to his look. 'He is
      the Master of wood, water, and hill.'</p>
      <p align="left">'Then all this strange land belongs to him?'</p>
      <p align="left">'No indeed!' she answered, and her smile faded. 'That would indeed be a
      burden,' she added in a low voice, as if to herself. 'The trees and the grass and all
      things growing or living in the land belong to themselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master. No
      one has ever caught old Tom walking in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the
      hill-tops under light and shadow. He has no fear. Tom Bombadil is master.'</p>
      <p align="left">This passage is from the first book of the trilogy, <em>The Fellowship of
      the Ring</em>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">The life of a druid can be one of the most rewarding and<img src="images/liggesm.jpg" alt="Ligge EQ Druid" align="right" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150"> exciting
    experiences imaginable. Druids are, without question, the masters of the outdoors. There
    is no one that can travel as efficiently as a druid and I venture to say almost no one as
    versatile for solo hunting or group hunting.</p>
    <p align="left">We are healers, buffers, melee artists and offensive casters! I know, I
    hear the screams already... &quot;but Ligge, every class has a downside&quot;. Yes, that
    is entirely and we have a couple that have to be dealt with to be a successful druid. Not
    the least of which is the love of all things natural. In my eyes it is an absolute sin to
    slay any of Karana's kind creatures. Standing your
    ground on this belief will make certain periods of your life difficult, as there are times
    when the best experience will only come from slaying animals. DON'T DO IT!</p>
    <p align="left">If you stick to your beliefs it will make life a tad more
    challenging, which is why we are all traveling Norrath after all, and that much more
    rewarding when you know you have gained the next level in your experience and have not had
    to harm and animal in the process. If you choose to be a druid and an animal slayer you
    should really look into being a ranger (more akin to a hunting class anyway) instead of
    being such a blatant blasphemer. Only cowards and Ogres should be performing such treachery. I will not harp on
    that any longer here. I am also aware that there are some excpetions. The
    Gods at verant have chosen to make things like lions hostile to us and leave
    us little choice in some cases. You also need to decide for yourslef what
    constitutes a friendly animal and what does not. My general rule of thumb is
    if they are aggressive to me I will protect myself and my team, but I will
    not actively hunt them. Freaks of nature is another side of this equation
    and includes such beasts as the griffon family, aviaks, centaurs, etc. I
    leave those for you to decide upon.</p>
    <p align="left">Though I do thoroughly enjoy watching as a druid gets eaten by a kodiak he
    attacked. Scream for help all you want blasphemer! Ligge will just sit and watch.
    Hopefully soon something will be implemented to penalize all you wayward souls. maybe I
    can give Holly a list so she and her brother will hunt you down anytime you are in the
    Qeynos area. Or allow other good faction druids to heal animals that are being attacked.</p>
    <p align="left">The other semi-negative issue we have is dungeons or internal hunting areas. A
    lot of our best spells are less useful at lower levels. Until you get to your 19th season things like
    Camouflage, Lightning, and Wind spells can not be cast indoors. At 19th you get a few mana
    expensive replacements for some spells. You also earn less experience indoors. Well,
    actually it's that you get bonus experience outdoors, but it all works out the same.
    At later levels your role changes indoors dramatically. Places like SolA and
    SolB you will feel completely out of sorts. Your direct damage dealing
    spells are highly resisted as they are fire based, but your DoTs and damage
    shields work just fine. With a little practice, and a good group you are an
    asset even here with the odds against you.</p>
    <p align="left">Also
    at this time you begin to get the personal teleport spells. What a bonus! You already can
    bind yourself anywhere, run around with Spirit of the Wolf always on, and now set your own
    bind spot to Gate back to on a whim.</p>
    <p align="left">Do you really use all that traveling stuff? Even Karana has a hard time
    keeping up with where Ligge is today. I tend to hit everything from Qeynos area to Oasis
    of Marr on any given day. Then of course if I decide to go continent hopping my eyes take
    in even more. So what is the point of all the traveling? Two things come readily to mind.</p>
    <p align="left">Exporting business! If you have snakeskin armor why sell it in the local
    regions for bottom dollar? Store it in the bank and hold it until you have traversed to
    another continent or furthest region on the same and sell it there. I once got 20pp for a
    snakeskin tunic in Greater Faydark where I had sold one previously in Rivervale for 5pp,
    the same day!</p>
    <p align="left">Scouting is the second advantage. Do yourself and your partners a favor.
    go find new hunting areas. You can run around and return home faster than anyone. You can
    use camouflage and stay undetected in most areas. What better way to swim all of Lake
    Rathetear without fear and gate home to Rivervale for nice brew and a little fun with
    Nillipuss to end the day.</p>
    <p align="left">Overcrowding. We all know this is a problem and with a druid
    around it becomes less of one. If you get somewhere that is crowded and
    unenjoyable, port. You should know by this time what your choices are and
    where the best likelihood of finding a quiet spot is anyway. Try the spot
    you want, if its full, go elsewhere. It's all in your hands.</p>
    <p align="left">I fully intend to expand on each of these subjects, and many more, I have
    touched on here, but for now I hope I have given you some food for though and a taste of
    the wonderful world we druids have at our disposal. While things may be tough at times
    trying to keep the animals at bay and protecting our great land, we are one of the most
    helpful and enjoyable classes available.</p>
