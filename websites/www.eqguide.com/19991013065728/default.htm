  <p>Welcome to Everquest Guide, formerly EverQuest Sucks! Hints, tips, and role playing
  information for the online game Everquest. We have combined talents and now
  http://www.eqguide.com will be our new home. So if you are looking for eqsucks.com,
  eqguide.com or the old everquestsucks.com, well you found it.</p>
  <p>We will be slowly adding game tips and everquest hints as we go. As well as links to
  other everquest web sites and reviews of those sites to make it easier to find what you
  are looking for. Everquest is an unbelievably immersive online game set in the world of
  Norrath. We hop you like it!</p>
  <p>One huge difference with the new Everquest guide pages is the implementation of frames.
  You will need a frames capable browser to view our pages, preferably <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">Internet Explorer</a> for best results.</p>
