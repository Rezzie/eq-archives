<H4>ELEVENTH CIRCLE SPELLS (From Grimstaff)</H4>
<P>All notes from Grimstaff</P>
<P><B>Arch Shielding</B> The last upgrade in your protective shield spells started long ago.  This increases your AC by 27, your Magic Resistance by 20, and your Hit Points by 150.  This takes so long to cast that
it actually is very very difficult to cast it before the spell fades.  Can be purchased in Felwithe (out in the side building), Ak'Anon, and Erudin library.</P>

<P><B>Cobolt Scar Portal</B> Teleports your party to the Dragon Circle in Cobolt Scar, but only if you have picked up the dragon tooth that spawns there.  I don't have this spell as it was an incredibly rare drop off monsters
and has been recently added to a vendor in Skyshrine where I can't get to safely yet.  As always, be a good wizard and don't charge unless you are taken well out of your way.</P>

<P><B>Conflaguration</B> Your big blast for the level.  This is a truly monumental explosion of damage, it really will tear things up.  Remember those creatures that gave you troubles in your 20s, the guys you had a hard time killing
and had to run from?  One of these will make them lie down.  Finally you have a notable advantage in power over all other classes in Direct Damage blasting, over 100 points more than anyone else.  Casts slow, and is fire, which makes it
useless in some areas of the game.</P>

<P><B>Diamondskin</B> Another in the protective skin line of spells.  This absorbs up to 394 points of damage from spells or physical attack.  Unfortunately, it uses a Peridot to cast, which costs upwards of 13 plat to cast.  This 
incredible increase in componant cost is NOT accompanied by an equivalent increase in protective skin, and in Velious, that 394 points fades like coffee at an AA meeting.  Don't bother with this unless you are obscenely rich.</P>

<P><B>Elemental Armor</B> This is an upgrade to the Elemental Shield spell way back at level 20.  30 points of protection vs cold and fire isn't an upgrade that seems worth waiting 24 levels for, but it is more than you had before, and it does
last an awfully long time.</P>

<P><B>Enticement of Flame</B> Your first Lure spell at present.  This spell does a set amount of damage or nothing at all, and is not especially mana efficient.  The damage is somewhat low for this level, but it is unlikely to be resisted unless
the monster is immune to fire.  As such, you can drop it on such monsters as the Enraged Relative in the Tower of Shadowed Souls in Velious, the EXG Golem in Sol A, and the Gullerback ape in the Burning Woods.  It drops randomly off Ancient Wurms
in Velious, which makes it a fairly uncommon spell and one that will cost a LOT of platinum.  Note: this spell is not as unresistable as full Lure spells, but WILL allow you to hit things over the level resistance cap.  In other words, you can land this spell on 
any level of monster in the game, although the higher they are the better the resistances they have.</P>

<P><B>Evacuate: Nek</B> Another emergency group port, this time to the pyramid in Nektulos Forest.  This has a slight chance of leaving someone behind, although not a very big one in most cases.</P>

<P><B>Force Strike</B> The last in your line of Force spells that do good damage and interrupt casting.  By this time it casts so slowly that you really have no chance of interrupting anyone casting any spell, so the spell is really just an alternate to 
Conflaguration that isn't fire.  Unfortunately like Force Shock it is so resistable by being all or nothing that it isn't much of an alternative.  And unlike the others it actually does less damage than your main blast.  All in all this is pretty disappointing.</P>

<P><B>Frost Storm</B> Another rain spell, cold this time (conspicuously red and orange).  Again broken, hopefully fixed soon.  This does a total of 750 damage, which if it hits with every wave is more than your blast will do.</P>

<P><B>Gravity Flux</B> Using the same template as Al'Kabor spell (hits 5 targets, has a large area of effect), this flings creatures that do not save into the air with a pulse of damage, then they hit the ground for more.  In PVP this can do catastrophic 
damage to someone, and it has odd tactical uses such as getting places you can't otherwise.  Of interesting note: monsters seem to be unable to cast or attack even with ranged effects while flying through the air, and obviously, they cannot run toward 
you.  This opens up some possibilities and tactical use in the right areas.  This spell is researchable by Enchanters at level 39 (they get it first, their ONLY damage Area Effect spell), or with the runes of The Rathe, Inverse, and Attraction.

<P><B>Great Divide Portal</B> Teleports your party to the Dragon Circle in Great Divide, but only if you have picked up the dragon tooth that spawns there.  I don't have this spell as it was an incredibly rare drop off monsters
and has been recently added to a vendor in Skyshrine where I can't get to safely yet.  As always, be a good wizard and don't charge unless you are taken well out of your way.</P>

<P><B>Wakening Lands Portal</B> Teleports your party to the Dragon Circle in Wakening Lands, but only if you have picked up the dragon tooth that spawns there.  I don't have this spell as it was an incredibly rare drop off monsters
and has been recently added to a vendor in Skyshrine where I can't get to safely yet.  As always, be a good wizard and don't charge unless you are taken well out of your way.</P>

<P>A basic note on Velious Ports: There are Combine style spires in parts of Velious, but those are not your portals.  You will always port to a basic circle with a big dragon statue over it, same as the Druid.  While this is confusing and puts to lie 
the standard Verant line about combine porters and why you can't go some places, it is important to know.  The Dragon Tooth needed to port to all of the Dragon Circles other than Iceclad spawns on the ground within the circle every 30 seconds or so 
and are easy to see in the snow.  All but the Iceclad portal are for sale in the Skyshrine dungeon.  To move safely within there you will need magical cloaking or great faction with dwarves and claws of veeshan (dragons).</P>
