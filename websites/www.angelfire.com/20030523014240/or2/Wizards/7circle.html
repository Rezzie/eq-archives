<TD><H4>SEVENTH CIRCLE SPELLS (From Grimstaff)</H4>
<P><font size="2">Some of these spells must be researched</font></P></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>All notes from Grimstaff</P>
<P><B>Cast Force</B> Point Blank magical Area Effect, Does decent damage, and like all PB spells has a very high number of maximum targets.  Although at this level it isn't quite powerful enough to be a major impact
in fights, it is a good backup at later levels when you have Thunderclap, for instance). Research only, using the Rune of Presence and of Disassociation.</P>
<P><B>Cazic Gate</B> This spell teleports the Wizard into the middle of the Cazic Thule dungeon.  In fact, it teleports you on top of a pyramid typically surrounded by creatures that will be yellow CON to 
you at this level, which means you simply die in a hurry.  There is some talk of having someone else cast invisibility on you while your gate is still going off, so you show up safely, but for a few levels at 
least I suggest you not bother using this suicide spell.</P>
<P><B>Column of Lightning</B> Another in the Column/Pillar line of Area Effect spells, the most mana efficient AE spell you will find much use for. The area is smaller than Al'Kabor, but the damage is satisfying and
this is an excellent green buster.  Research only, using the Runes of Trauma and Xegony.</P>
<P><B>Combine Gate</B> This spell teleports you to the huge Wizard Spires in the Dreadlands.  At this level you will be hard pressed to survive exploring, but the area it ports you into is fairly safe.  Combines Gate 
can be found for sale in the Temple of Solusek Ro. It being sold by a gnomish vendor named Terblyn Zelbus located on the balcony overlooking the doors right before the moving bookcase.</P>
<P><B>Common Gate</B> Teleports you to the pyramid in West Commons, not far from the lake.  A safe landing site, and puts you comfortably on the OTHER side of Kithcor forest, which recently has 
become very unwholesome for folks our level.  Watch out for Inkies, Dragoon Zytl and Kizdean Gix show up nearby sometimes.</P>
<P><B>Frost Shock</B> The big boomer for this level.  Your only direct damage spell for 24, but it does nearly as much as Force Shock to start with and out damages it in a few levels.  Also, being cold
it is not resisted nearly as much, and is not an all-or-nothing spell.  The only reason I memorize Force Shock anymore is to use the disrupt facet of it to stop spellcasters sometimes.</P>
<P><B>Leatherskin</B> Another skin spell, absorbing considerably more than the previous one.  Leatherskin uses up a Bloodstone, which costs more than double the previous reagent.  Sometimes I run
out because I am tapped for cash, but it is well worth the money.  As you go up levels you will make more than enough money to pay for this.</P>
<P><B>Levitate</B> Makes you, or one other person float.  In fact, you can cast it on monsters, although it has no effect.  This has more use than you'd think, it can keep you from swimming if you don't
want to, it will prevent all falling damage, and it can actually let you fly over dangerous creatures.  For fun, leap off the Aviak town highest tower!  Can be researched with the Runes of Explusion and 
Attraction, although most other casters can buy this spell, so there isn't any pressing need to research it.</P>
<P><B>Lightning Storm</B> A big rain spell, this has the potential to do 225 damage to 4 creatures closely packed, which is a ton of damage.  Plus, because it is low on the range of damage for this level,
it won't tend to aggro the monsters if used carefully.  However, it is resisted a lot, being magic, and rarely gets all 3 shocks off, and still suffers from the Rain AE bug.  Research only, using the Runes of Karana and Xegony.</P>
<P><B>Major Shielding</B> Another shielding upgrade, more HP and AC, plus the magic resistance helps a lot at this level.  All personal resistance buffs stack with other people's, which can make you 
very protected.</P>
<P><B>Nek Gate</B> Teleports you to the undead Pyramid in Nektulos Forest.  This is uncomfortably close to Neriak for those who are KOS there, but is fairly safe otherwise.  The Skeletons nearby aggro on anything, but are half
your level and easily dispatched.  I have never seen a  guard even near here, and the run north to Lavastorm or south to East Commons is a safe one with invisibility on.</P>
<P><B>Ro Gate</B> Teleports you to the Pyramid in North Ro desert, a fairly safe and comfortable place, usually.  This is often called the 'sunken temple' by those less enlightened, and is typically camped due to the traffic of high powered
people that will help if someone is in danger.</P>
<P><B>West Gate</B> Teleports you to the Pyramid in West Karana, very near the undead ruins and river, also, unfortunately, very near the North Karana Border, which is far, far from anything to the west.  
You are barely a minute from the Teleporter in North Karana, including zone time for most computers and the entire West Karana zone must be crossed to reach the West coast of Antonica.</P>
