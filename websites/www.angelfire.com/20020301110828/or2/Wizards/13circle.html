<P><B>Translocate</B>: At present there is only one spell for level 50, Translocate.  All this spell does is teleport the target group member to their bind spot.  In other words, it is a 'gate other' spell.  This is a very useful 
addition to your book, more useful than you would think.  How many times have you had to close for the night because one or more members has to quit and can't camp where you are?  How many times have you had to 
leave the group and port someone off, make your way back, and rejoin just to get them home?  Translocate allows you to take care of these problems and more.  It allows you to send that sleeping guy home so he's safe, 
it lets you get stranded tanks in a dungeon like Sebilis back home because the zone out is through very hostile territory they cannot cross alone.  Translocate will be your groups new favorite spell.</P>  

Again, don't charge to use this, it only costs you mana.  At the same token, don't buy it, ever.  This spell doesn't do anything for YOU that you can't do at level 4 with Gate.  Translocate drops off Crystalline Wurms in 
the Great Divide.  By the level you can use this, they are blue, but fairly dangerous.  You will not be able to solo them, because they are in a huge cave with 4 spawns and cannot be pulled clear without encountering 
OTHER wurms.  Verant is looking at putting a yes/no dialog box on this like Ressurect so that people can deny a translocate if they don't want one.  This would negate the ability to send a sleeping party member 
home to safety, but would also prevent nefarious use of the spell.</P>
