</TABLE>

<P><font size="2">All These spells can be found in any Wizards guild</font></P>
<P><B>Column of Frost:</B> Area Effect, if not used carefully this will typically just makes lots of enemies for a lot of mana.  See my tips for using AE spells safely, unfortunately at these levels your AE spells aren't as useful as they
probably should be.</P>
<P><B>Eye of Zomm:</B> Very nifty looking, good for screen shots of yourself.  Don't go scouting into dangerous areas because it's a train maker. Can't swim for crap, but is fun to startle people with.  As a side note, 
Barbarians and Hobbits seem to pop it a lot.</P>
<P><B>Fingers of Fire:</B> Never used it much, but it fires off all around you like the Numbing Cold spell of level 1. While this was very handy then, when I am surrounded now, I am dying, and want to escape, not 
blow them up.</P>
<P><B>Fire Bolt:</B> very good damage, looks nice, and has a terrific range.  Use it when you solo to pull creatures for you, and you can almost always have time for a root and possibly another bolt then a root. 
Sucks on uneven ground and cannot shoot through your friends.</P>
<P><B>Lesser Shielding:</B> Second Purchase after Shock of Ice.  Adds more armor and hit points than Minor Shielding.</P>
<P><font size="2">This spell is typically found outside the normal spell merchants for your Wizard, as it it shared by all caster classes.</font></P>
<P><B>Sense Summoned:</B> Only reason to get this is to practice Divination.  Has no value that I can determine, at least at my level.  Summoned creatures are limited to things like Elementals, and few other creatures.</P>
<P><B>Shadow Step:</B> Use this rather than Fade.  Costs the same mana, casts faster, and can actually teleport further than Fade.  At higher levels, this will teleport you so far that you can be totally disoriented.  If you 
manage to teleport far enough away, sometimes the creature will lose interest in you, but don't rely on this.  Again, will not teleport UP and thus is limited in its usefulness in uneven territory.  In addition, close items such as buildings
and trees limit how far you can teleport.</P>
<P><B>Shock of Ice:</B> Most mana efficient spell at this level. Does less damage than the bolt but always hits and is resisted less often. Uses less mana for the damage, should be your primary weapon until 
Shock of Lightning.  At 20th level you will find this still in your repertoire of spells, a small, very fast blast of cold (you won't get another cold blast, the least resisted, until level 24).</P>
