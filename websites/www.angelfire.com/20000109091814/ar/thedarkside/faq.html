<td><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Q: Why should
I be a necromancer ?</font></font></i>
<Br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">A: That is an easy
one.&nbsp; You should be a necromancer simply because it is the coolest
class in an Norrath.&nbsp; It will provide a very nice gaming experience
since necromancers are not only a powerful class, but also a challenging
one.&nbsp; NPCs will not like you most of the times and you will constantly
have to work on your faction standing.&nbsp; Thus, your "life" will not
be limited to hitting the A button.</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Q: How powerful
is a necromancer ?</font></font></i>
<Br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">A: In my oppinion,
a very powerful one.&nbsp; Necromancers don't have much in terms of direct
damage as other spellcasters do and are pretty weak in a melee combat.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, we are the only class that can deal damage at the same time
we recover life with the Drain Life (DL) group of spells.&nbsp; You might
not realize how powerful a necromancer is until you reach level 12 though.&nbsp;
It is at that level that necromancers get the first real powerful spells.&nbsp;
Besides Bind Affinity, which binds you to an area and thus allows you to
travel freely through Norrath, we get Lifedraw (a DL spell that maxes at
45 damage), Convoke Shadow (the first pet with magical attack abilities),
Spook the Dead (a spell that makes undead creatures just run run run and
making you even more skilled when fighting against undeads), and two great
DoT spells, Heat Blood and Engulfing Darkness.&nbsp; In sum, our combination
of pet spells, DL spells and DoT spells make us a very powerful class indeed.</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Q: What are the
disadvantages of playing a necromancer ?</font></font></i>
<Br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">A: As mentioned
before, necromancers are disliked by most NPCs in Norrath, including some
in your own home town.&nbsp; Thus, you will not be able to walk around
in towns unless you are invisible.&nbsp; That makes you pretty much stuck
to the areas close to your home town until you reach level 8 and can purchase
the invisibility spell.&nbsp; There are ways to fix that though.&nbsp;
You can kill creatures that will improve your faction standing with NPCs
and guards from a specific region.&nbsp; For example, you can go to Black
Burrow and kill gnolls.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, you will improve your
faction standing with NPCs, merchants and guards of Qeynos.&nbsp; Whenever
you go back to Qeynos, consider them and pay attention to what they say.&nbsp;
It might take some time but at some point they will be indifferent to you
and won't bother with your presence anymore.&nbsp; You will even be able
to purchase things from merchants.&nbsp; Take a look at the Faction Standing
guide for a more complete list of things you can do to improve your faction
standing.</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Q: Can I ever
improve my faction standing ?&nbsp; Or can I ever walk in towns that are
not my home town without getting killed ?</font></font></i>
<Br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">A: Yes you can.&nbsp;
Take a look at the answer above.</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Q: Any tips for
a newbie necromancer ?</font></font></i>
<Br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">A: Well, the most
important thing you should do when starting a new character is gathering
enough money to buy cavorting bones, the first pet spell.&nbsp; A necromancer
is fairly weak without his or her pet.&nbsp; Once you get your pet, it
is important to understand how to deal with it.&nbsp; The best tactic when
fighting with a pet is as follow.&nbsp; Cast a spell pulling the creature
and send yout pet to combat.&nbsp; Take a few hits and then back off, leaving
your pet holding the creature while you stand behind casting Lifetap.&nbsp;
Once you regain some of the lost HPs step back into combat and repeat the
same process until the creature is dead.&nbsp; Other important things for
are knowing where the guards are (you can run close to them when in danger
and they will kill the creature for you), learning the location of the
necro guild in your home town (you will have to buy those new spells as
well as food and water), knowing which opponents to fight against (always,
but always consider a creature before engaging into combat), and get to
know people in your area (as a necro, you will have difficulty buying things
that are not available at your local necro and a friend will help you overcome
that problem as he might go and buy you things like armor to you in town).</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Q: What race should
I be when playing a necromancer ?</font></font></i>
<Br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">A: That is hard
question as it depends on your playing preferences.&nbsp; In my oppinion,
Erudites and Dark Elves make up the best necromancers among all races.&nbsp;
Erudites are the most intelingent race in all Norrath (base of 117) and
will give you plenty of mana.&nbsp; Charisma is also not that bad (base
of 70).&nbsp; Dark Elves are also high on inteligence (base of 109), have
very good agility (base of 90), and have two special powers, hiding and
ultravision.&nbsp; The main drawback for both races is that they are disliked
throught Norrath, specially the evil Dark Elves.</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Q: Where should
I spend my practice points ?</font></font></i>
<Br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">A: Initially, at
channeling.&nbsp; It will reduce the chances of fizzling a spell.&nbsp;
Once you make it to level 4, spend a few points in meditate as it will
speed up your mana recovery.&nbsp; I would not spend points pretty much
anywhere else as you will learn other skills on your own, through practice
in battles.&nbsp; Save those points for skills you can only use later on
such as research, old erudin or any other trade skill (e.g. jewelry, tailoring,
etc.).</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Q: I need to buy
a spell but I cannot find it in my necro guild. What should I do ?</font></font></i>
<Br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">A: For some reason,
some spells are just not available in necro guilds.&nbsp; Most of the spells
that can be used by necromancers and other spellcaster classes you just
cannot find.&nbsp; In order to buy it, you will have to ask a friend of
yours that is not a necro to go to a different spellcaster guild and buy
it for you.&nbsp; If not, just offer money to anyone that brings you the
spell you are looking for.</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Q: I keep on dying
and loosing experience and can never make it to the next level.&nbsp; Is
there anything I can do ?</font></font></i>
<Br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">A: One important
thing to learn when fighting in a region is how safe is the place you are.&nbsp;
Black Burrow for example is like train town.&nbsp; There are so many trains
in that place that chances are you will get hit by one.&nbsp; Places like
this make solo work a lot harder since you will not have any back up in
case things get a little out of hand.&nbsp; Thus, look for a party of characters
roughly the same level you are.&nbsp; Never join a party in which someone
is more than 3 levels above or below yours.&nbsp; You will get very little
experience from that.&nbsp; But do join parties since you will be safer
with them.&nbsp; Your experience will not go up as fast as if you were
alone, but you will also not die very often and loose those precious XP.&nbsp;
The other thing you can do is simply look for a better place to fight in,
anywhere where trains are less likely to happen.&nbsp; Take a look at the
Zone Analysis section for some tips on where should you be.</font></font>
