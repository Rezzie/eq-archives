</TABLE>

<P><B>Frost Bolt (5 damage starting)</B>Frost Bolt is the first Bolt spell you get.  Although it costs a goodly amount of mana, it does more damage than Shock of Frost, and has a tremendous range.  Bolt spells tend to get blocked off by things like 
trees and your helpful tank, and on uneven ground often will hit the ground and have no effect (note: looking up slightly tends to help this on hills).  But the long range impresses other casters especially and the spell 
looks nifty. </P>
<P><B>Minor Shielding:</B> A Starter Spell, good for many levels.  Dont let it turn off, your armor is terrible but with this, you actually will have a better AC than almost everyone else (non twinked) who is of many other 
classes around you at this level.</P>
<P><B>Numbing Cold: </B>At this level, ignore all the warnings about area effect spells.  Use this any time you have more than one monster attacking you, I actually read about someone who used this spell and Shock of 
Frost, giving like 4 or 5 creatures one blast and running until he's surrounded, then using this spell to kill them all in a big pile.  Lights up everything nearby you for fair damage, also obscures vision badly when it goes 
off.  For Bonus points, trigger this spell while looking at your character from an outside shot, it is very impressive looking.</P>
<P><B>Shock of Frost:</B> A Starter Spell low casting cost, and a small amount of damage.  Shock of Frost is very consistent and casts quickly.  I was using this spell well into level 12, because it was something I could cast with virtually no 
mana left and still contribute some.  Since then I have made a policy of not getting that low in mana.</P>
<P><B>Sphere of Light:</B> Creates a minor light stone, looks like a clear marble.  The item puts out a fair amount of light, and can be just carried in your inventory, but unfortunately cannot be handed out to your blind 
friends.  Strangely enough is tagged to be useable by Enchanters.  Useful for Humans and Erudites, or for those who just like to see things a little more clearly in the local area.</P>
<P><B>True North:</B> Very limited usefulness.  Because you can simply drop any weapon and it will point north, and because the clouds always blow from east to west, it is not especially challenging to find out what way is North.
However, this can be of use for the naked caster in a foggy or rainy situation, and is certainly not as utterly worthless as what it replaced (Sense Magic).</P>
