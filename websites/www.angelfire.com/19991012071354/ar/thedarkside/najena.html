<td><font color="#C0C0C0">Najena in located next to <a href="lavastrm.html">Lavastorm</a>,
to the very north of the Antonica continent.&nbsp; To get to Najena, follow
the mountains to your right (when zoning from <a href="nektulos.html">Nektulos
Forest</a>).&nbsp; It will take you to a broken gate where a small tunnel
will lead you to the entrance to Najena.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Najena is close to a necromancers dream, as this
dungeon is full of undead creatures.&nbsp; Do not be fooled by the bones
on the floor as most skeletons in Najena remain that way until you attack
or they attack you.&nbsp; As soon as you zone into Najena, a Large Skeleton
will be on the floor.&nbsp; Past that skeleton, a small area has two more
Large Skeletons or an occasional Greater Skeleton.&nbsp; If you keep going
past this area you will enter another very small room.&nbsp; Five skeletons
spawn here, most commonly from the Large kind.&nbsp; An Ogre Guard also
guards this area and spawns pretty fast.&nbsp; From this room you can choose
two different paths.&nbsp; The one to your right will lead to the "small
room", a room where two Tentacle Terrors spawn.&nbsp; The path to your
left will lead to another small room with a few Earth Elementals and occasional
Mist Elementals and further down to the "large room".&nbsp; The large room
spawns a variety of creatures.&nbsp; Right at the entrance you find two
skeletons standing on each side.&nbsp; If you kill these, they will spawn
Tentacle Terrors instead of two more skeletons.&nbsp; Further inside you
can find a few Elementals (either Earth or Mist ones) and an Ogre Guard.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">That is a brief description of the first part
of the Najena dungeon.&nbsp; The second part of it is a much more difficult
one and you should only adventure deeper in Najena once you reach level
24 or so.&nbsp; But once you do get to that level, make sure you pay Najena
a visit as this is the most rewarding area of the dungeon.&nbsp; The first
area you can visit can be accessed through an illusionary wall to the left
of the hallway.&nbsp; A few higher level skeletons will be guarding this
area but as a necromancer you should have no problem dealing with them.&nbsp;
Follow the tunnel downstairs and you be in the good part of the dungeon
for mid-level characters.&nbsp; Three different creatures are very sought
after in this part, the two higher ranked Ogres, the Captain (level 27)
and the Officer (level 24), door to right,&nbsp; and the Bonecracker Ghoul
(level 24), door to left.&nbsp; All three will drop very good loot, specially
Bonecracker who carries magical items such as the barbed whip and flesh
rings.&nbsp; The Ogres expensive pieces of armor including bronze platemail
parts.&nbsp; A Visiting Priestess (level 26) is often around the Captain's
room so be careful.&nbsp; She can hit hard and is accompanied by Ogres.&nbsp;
She can also heal critters fighting around her.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">You need to fight Bonecracker in order to proceed
further inside the dungeon.&nbsp; He will drop a key that will open the
door to the first of three NPCs.&nbsp; I will describe them later in this
analysis.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">The best tactic for characters level 16 to 20
is to stay close to the entrance of Najena and fight the Tentacle Terrors
from the small room if at the lower part of the level range just given
or from the large room if at the higher part.&nbsp; It is important to
understand that skeletons will attack you on sight until you reach level
18, Ogres will do the same until you reach level 19 (for the lower level
ones), and Greater Skeletons until you reach level 20.&nbsp; Thus, make
sure you take some time to clear up your way back to the zone to Lavastorm
every once in a while so that you won't get a train if those nasty Tentacles
turn out to be more dangerous then you first thought.&nbsp; A party is
necessary until you reach level 20+ to fight the tentacles.&nbsp; The tentacles
will drop very good loot, often a platinum or two and sometimes the Tentacle
Whip, a powerful weapon that drains life from its opponents.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Once you reach level 20+ you can start going deeper
inside Najena and fight the tougher ogres and Bonecracker.&nbsp; Once again,
make sure you bring some friends along as these are some nasty opponents.&nbsp;
The Ogre captain hits very, very hard and is surrounded by several lower
level Ogres guarding him.&nbsp; Thus, a train is not unlikely to happen.&nbsp;
Bonecracker is on the door to the left of the stairs, while the Ogres are
to the right of the stairs.&nbsp; Both rooms are heavily occupied. The
Ogre room is full of Ogres (doh!) while Bonecracker's room has 2 necromancers
with their pets and an Ogre Guard that occasionally walks in.&nbsp; The
worst thing about these rooms is that they are quite small, making it very
hard to distinguish events in a battle (most of the times I had no idea
what was going on in there).&nbsp; If you are considering fighting Bonecracker,
I would advise that you have someone tanking him while the others focus
on killing the necromancers since both of them cast DoT spells and can
inflict quite a lot of damage.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Characters level 25+ may attempt fighting the
NPCs located in Najena.&nbsp; As I mentioned before, once you kill Bonecracker
you will get a key that will open the door to the first NPC, Drezlna.&nbsp;
To get to her, go to the large room where two Tentacle Terrors spawn and
head past the gates with Najena's symbol.&nbsp; You will go past a few
elementals and will have a choice to turn left and head down some stairs.&nbsp;
This is the way to Najena but I will come back to her later.&nbsp; Keep
going just a little more and you will hit a wall.&nbsp; Take the path to
your right and immediately turn left.&nbsp; If you turn right and then
another right you will fall down a hole to a cell where an injured halfling
spawns.&nbsp; This cell requires a key (Guard key) so try not to fall in
it :). After turning left, turn left again (turning right will take you
to another fake hole) and follow path until you get to three closed doors.
The door to your right is locked and is Drezlna's spawning place.&nbsp;
She is the easiest of the 3 NPCs and is guarded by a few necromancers and
their pets. Other things might spawn in there such as Tentacle Terrors
and Ogre Guards.&nbsp; As is true with all NPCs, Drezlna doesn't always
spawn so you might have to kill the entire spawn and hope she appears on
the next one.&nbsp; A full party of levels 25+ should have no problem killing
her and I have done it with no clerics in my team.&nbsp; Have someone open
the door and pull Drezlna outside.&nbsp; You should all kill her before
anything else to prevent her from charming someone. Drezlna drops the sought
after Journeyman's Boots, a ring +5 vs. disease attacks, bronze armor,
and the Bloodclaw Stiletto.&nbsp; None of these items are very common and
it might take your party quite a few tries to get what you are looking
for.&nbsp; The important thing is she drops the key to the second NPC in
Najena, Rathyl, as well as the gold key to Najena.&nbsp;&nbsp; One last
note, once you are done killing Drezlna for the first time, you should
camp inside her room.&nbsp; She will spawn with your party there and it
will make it easier to kill everything that spawns in there, specially
if you take the necromancers before they can cast a pet.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Well, Rathyl is an entirely different story.&nbsp;
I could say with reasonable confidence that he is a lot harder than Najena
herself.&nbsp; To successfully kill Rathyl, you must have a very well balanced
party, with clerics, tanks, and spellcasters.&nbsp; Not having at least
1 high level cleric means death in the majority of cases.&nbsp; To get
to Rathyl, take the middle door from where you just fought Drezlna and
follow path.&nbsp; You will get to a room where you will see a few cells.&nbsp;
Rathyl is in one of the corners, behind a small gate like door.&nbsp; You
will need the key found at Drezlna's corpse to open this door.&nbsp; Rathyl
is guarded by quite a few magicians and necromancers.&nbsp; Once the battle
starts, there will be so many things to kill that surviving will take all
your party has.&nbsp; And the worst thing is, once you kill Rathyl, he
will reincarnate and come back as a pretty large skeleton.&nbsp; So, keep
those healers safe and healing and pray nothing goes wrong because the
zone is very far away.&nbsp; Rathyl will drop the Traveler's Backpack,
bronze armor, and a magical bracelet (not sure about the stats).&nbsp;
He will also drop a key to Najena's room.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Finally, the final battle!&nbsp; Your party has
killed Rathyl and is looking for the main prize of the dungeon.&nbsp; Getting
to Najena can be quite tricky if you don't know you way around.&nbsp; Here
is what you have to do.&nbsp; Go back to the point I mentioned before where
you can take some stairs down.&nbsp; At the end of the stairs you should
see a small water pool.&nbsp; Jump in the water and be careful with the
few frogloks that spawn in it.&nbsp; Swim down and go straight ahead.&nbsp;
Once you see that you can go back up again, do so.&nbsp; You will get to
a place with a locked door, Najena's spawning place.&nbsp; The hardest
thing about Najena is actually finding her.&nbsp; She does not always spawn
and it might take your party a few tries to actually face her.&nbsp; Najena
is guarded by a few necromancers and a few magicians.&nbsp; They all have
pets and will often train you as soon as you open the door.&nbsp; Rathyl's
battle is tougher, but Najena herself is a pretty nasty NPC.&nbsp; She
has a pretty high resistance to magical attacks and charms reasonably easy.&nbsp;
Thus, focus your attention on killing her as soon as you can.&nbsp; I would
recommend the use of the /assist command in this battle as you will be
likely fighting in the small corridor before the door to Najena's room.&nbsp;
The space is very limited and the amount of creatures attacking your party
is beyond your comprehension :).&nbsp; A very rewarding battle once you
win as Najena often carries the popular Flowing Black Robe.&nbsp; And pretty
much everything she drops is great for a necromancer such as the book and
the Glowing Back Stone.&nbsp; A fun battle indeed.&nbsp; Do not camp outside
her room though as it prevents Najena from spawning.&nbsp; It is best if
you camp before the water pool and swim back tp her room after the spawn
has happened.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">One final comment:&nbsp; you do not have to fight
these 3 battles in the order described above.&nbsp; You can get a shiny
metal key from Ogres and if you do, you can fight Rathyl before Drezlna.&nbsp;
If you do so, you should then kill Drezlna to get the gold key that opens
Najena's door. (thank you Jim)</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">In time, past the water pool you go to find Najena
are a few strange inhabitants to the dungeon such as Black Widow Spiders
and Goblins.&nbsp; You can actually hunt in the goblin camp located just
past the water pool.&nbsp; It is a heavily populated camp and requires
a level 25+ party to take it down.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Overall, Najena is another one of my favorite
hunting grounds.&nbsp; It has creatures for characters level 16 all the
way to level 30+ and provides the necromancer with very good experience
and loot.&nbsp; There are several things here that can be sold for more
than 30 platinum and some for more than 300 platinum.</font></td>
