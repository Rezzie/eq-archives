<td><font color="#C0C0C0">East Commonlands is located nearby the cities
of Freeport and Neriak.&nbsp; It is linked to West Freeport and Nektulos
Forest, as well as the West Commonlands and the northern part of the Desert
of Ro.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">East Commonlands is pretty much the second stop
for low level characters that dwell in Freeport.&nbsp; After spending some
time hunting those annoying rats, young necromancers head to this area
for a wider variety of creatures.&nbsp; Besides the hunting, this area
has a few different Inns known by those that hunt here as Inns number 1,
2, and 3.&nbsp; The first Inn is located closer to Freeport while the third
one is located just near the zone to West Commonlands.&nbsp; As you might
have guessed, the second Inn is right in the middle of the three Inns.&nbsp;
These Inns sell a good variety of simple things such as cloth armor pieces,
food, water, common weapons and even bone chips.&nbsp; Most necromancers
will have trouble getting into one though as the merchants might attack
you on sight.&nbsp; Make sure you consider them before attempting a trade.&nbsp;
In addition, a few guards are located in the first and second Inns, as
well as some roaming the roads of East Commonlands.&nbsp; Thus, if you
are zoning in for the first time, make sure you cast invisibility until
you leave or make sure they are not aggressive towards you.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">A good tip for necromancers that want to trade
with the merchants in this area or NPCs in Freeport is to attack the Orcs
located both in this area and the surrounding zones.&nbsp; They will improve
your faction standing with merchants, NPCs and guards from Freeport.&nbsp;
Of course, it might take quite a lot of time before you can walk freely
around Freeport.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">I would most definetely recommend that only necromancers
that are not KOS to hunt here.&nbsp; It is bad enough to be slain by a
small snake so don't get yourself into more trouble by having to stay on
the watch for a roaming guard.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">You can find all sorts of creatures in East Commonlands,
ranging from the low level Decaying Skeleton to the tougher Young Kodiak.&nbsp;
If you have just reached level 4 or so, you should stay close to one of
those Inns where guards stay and hunt small creatures such as Snakes and
Fire Beetles.&nbsp; As you progress move to tougher creatures and feel
free to leave the vicinity of the Inns.&nbsp; At level 7 or so, a good
but often crowded spot to hunt at is one of the two Orc camps located here.&nbsp;
They will provide you with reasonably good loot, good experience and improve
your faction standing with the folks from Freeport as a bonus.&nbsp; Higher
level characters also have quite a few things they can kill, including
Darkweed Snakes and Young Kodiaks.&nbsp; These characters can also hunt
undeads such as Skeletons, Zombies and Lesser Mummies at the undead cemetery.&nbsp;
Simply Ward Undead them to death (note that as this is your first spell
that uses the evocation skill, you will need some practice before it can
be an effective battle spell).</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">As a zone for low level characters, East Commonlands
provides a good range of creatures.&nbsp; The merchants located here also
help as you do not have to go back too often to town for basic needs such
as food and water.&nbsp; The only bad thing about this region are the nasty
Griffins and Air Elementals that insist on showing up when you least expect.&nbsp;
Both will attack you on sight and specially the Griffins can kill you pretty
fast.&nbsp;</font></td>

mentioned before, be careful with the occasional Griffins and Air Elementals
(which can only be hit with magical weapons) as they will attack you on
sight.&nbsp; The best place to rest and get that mana back is near the
third Inn as Griffins rarely go that way.</font>
