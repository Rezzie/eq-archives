<td><font color="#C0C0C0">West Commonlands is located roughly in the middle
of the cities of Rivervale, Freeport and Neriak, in the Antonica continent.&nbsp;
It links several zones and can be accessed either through Kithicor Forest
(if coming from Rivervale) or <a href="ecommons.html">East Commonlands</a>
(if coming from Freeport or Neriak).</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">West Commonlands can be quite a nice place for
necromancers, specially those level 12 or higher.&nbsp; It spawns quite
a few creatures that will provide you good experience such as Young Kodiaks,
Kodiaks, Plains Pumas, Willowisps, different kinds of snakes, and two camps,
the cutthroats and the orcs.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">There are quite a few different things you can
do in this large area.&nbsp; One of my favorite strategies is choose a
zone to pull creatures and then head far away from it.&nbsp; Choose your
target and cast a DoT spell such as Heat Blood from a safe distance.&nbsp;
After casting, start running back towards the zone and stop just before
you zone.&nbsp; If you casted from a safe distance and did not change your
course too often, the creature would not have caught up with you for that
first hit and you will reach the zone area with a half dead creature.&nbsp;
By using this tactic you will be able to deal with stronger creatures.&nbsp;
I killed quite a few Kodiaks that con'ed red by doing this.&nbsp; And in
case things go wrong, you have a zone safely nearby.&nbsp; As an important
note, I would like to point out that most Kodiaks and Young Kodiaks will
not leave you alone once you cast a DoT spell on them and you will have
to time those Lifedraw very well in order to stay alive.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">You may also choose to attack one of the camps
located here.&nbsp; The orc camp is easier and you should be able to deal
with it at level 10 with a group of friends.&nbsp; For higher level characters
(level 13 or so) you can start grouping to take out the dervish camp.&nbsp;
I do not remeber exactly, but I believe a full spawn has about 10 cutthroats.&nbsp;
They vary in level and the toughest ones are the spellcasters and the thugs.&nbsp;
Not all cutthroats are linked, but pulling one will result in a quite a
few coming to battle.&nbsp; Thus, do not attempt to attack the camp without
a few friends backing you up.&nbsp; And do not head inside camp until you
clean up the place first as all cutthroats will attack you on sight.&nbsp;
This camp will provide good XP and occasional good loot.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Another thing you can do here is attack the Freeport
militiamen if you are in an evil mood.&nbsp; Nedless to say, this will
hurt your faction standing in Freeport quite fast and will make your shopping
a lot harder.&nbsp; But experience is good and these militiamen are not
that hard.&nbsp; A group of level 16 characters should be able to deal
with them.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">You can also camp in front of this obelisk where
a few skeletons spawn.&nbsp; Killing them will make tougher creatures spawn
such as Zombies and Ghouls.&nbsp; Ghouls are the hardest ones and it is
advisable to bring one or two friends along.&nbsp; A party of level 16
characters should deal with them quite easily.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Finally, a fourth strategy in West Commonlands
can only be used by high level characters (level 35 or higher).&nbsp; A
party of these mighty characters can group to take out the Griffons and
Hill Giants that often roam the plains.&nbsp; Be aware that these incredibly
strong creatures hit very, very hard so do not attempt to tank them yourself.&nbsp;
You will need not one, but a few fighter class friends to hold them off
you.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">In general, West Commonlands can give you good
XP and occasional good loot.&nbsp; If you are level 12 or higher you will
be able to solo most creatures in these plains.&nbsp; Some such as Young
Kodiaks and Kodiaks will hit you very hard and there will be quite a few
close calls.&nbsp; That only works to make this an exciting place for adolescent
necromancers and never a boring one.&nbsp; Except for the occasional sudden
death (like trying to figure out what size of shoes does a Hill Giant wear
or serving as appetizer to a Griffon), you will enjoy the West Commonlands.</font></td>

creatures you should keep your eye open roam these plais.&nbsp; The Griffon
and the Hill Giant, as mentioned above are quite common here and will attack
you on sight.&nbsp; If they do, and will rarely, very, very rarely be able
to escape.&nbsp; So be careful and try not to fight in the middle of West
Commonlads.&nbsp; It is advisable to pull your target to a zone area or
to the top of a hill.&nbsp; That will greatly reduce the chances of becoming
crushed by one of these monsters.&nbsp; Also, you should kill any orc you
see coming your way, even the easiest ones.&nbsp; They will improve your
faction standing with people in Freeport.&nbsp; Check the militiamen located
close this hut to see how they con.&nbsp; Once they con indifferent, you
can start pulling creatures next to them and in case things get a little
out of hand, run to them and they will attack your creature, possibly saving
you from yet one more corpse trip.</font>
