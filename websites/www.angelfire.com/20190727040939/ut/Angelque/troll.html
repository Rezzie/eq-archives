 Charater Guide for Trolls</font> </P>

The Troll Shaman, from newbie to name-level.	

	<P>Why be a troll at all? Much of this has been said before, but I'll work on the assumption that the reader knows little to nothing and hasn't read all the posts in other places. For many, the regeneration ability is highly attractive. Reduction in down-time is never a bad thing, and also aids greatly in soloing if you're so inclined. Keep in mind though that you regenerate at a fixed rate, not in proportion to your maximum HPTs--so the effects are most dramatic for the beginning levels of your career. Strikes against a troll shaman include having the worst wisdom of all the shaman races, dismal intelligence, hideous charisma, and being KOS most everywhere. Barbarians and (if available) Iksar have considerably better wisdom, and Ogres have better wisdom and better strength.</P>
	<P>What does a troll have more of? Style! Being the most dull-witted, crude, and generally loathsome PC race in all of Norrath offers tremendous role-playing potential, and in the end I think having fun is what the game is all about. Trolls have (in my opinion) the coolest graphics of all the PC races. The new Iksar graphics are pretty neat I admit--owing in no small part to the fact that they're more recent--but in the end Iksar are a bit pin-headed looking and lack the gruesome aspect of a troll. Trolls look particularly good in any sort of metal armor.</p>

<P>Role-playing a troll shaman: It's pretty easy to do colorfully. Spell everything phonetically, misspell (mispronounce) long words, take everything literally when possible, and misunderstand like an idiot any concept which won't actually hurt your tactics or your party. Use /em (emotes) creatively and often. Example: /em scritches his head, wondering what the heck that weird ogre is talking about. A good list of built-in emotes (some of which have preset graphics), as well as details on most quests and other good info like faction and /con, is available at Allakhazam's. Refer to magic as mojo, mana as mojo juice; don't abbreviate anything while in character--it takes away from the suspension of disbelieve and turns the game back to being about stats and such rather than role-play--'feet like cat' becomes kitty foots, etc. Oh yeah, and remember your deity and try to role-play being a follower of him as well as you can. We get choices of Innoruk (also popular with a lot of Dark Elves) and Cazic Thule. I chose Cazik because it was the least common--this was before Kunark came out.</p><BR>

General advice: 	
	<P>Help out your fellow trolls whenever possible. Apply this to a degree to ogres and even dark elves. Save lives whenever you can--it's a social game and your actions have consequences. A shaman can solo decently; in fact very well for while, but later on the option slowly becomes less viable. When in a party, keep everyone as buffed (enhanced with beneficial spells, the specialty of a shaman) as you can afford to mana-wise, and make sure before commencing the attack you're back up to full or at least good mana. Do *not* let the hot-headed front line fighters get impatient and make these decisions for you--they'll regret it as soon as they start taking damage, need their wounds healed or their disease cured, and you don't have the mana for it.</P>
	 <P>Use the /con function on EVERYTHING. It tells you what chances you have (roughly) of taking potential opponents. It tells you how they feel about you before you walk up to them. Being a troll, the general rule of thumb is: if it's a PC race, and it's not a troll, ogre, or dark elf, it will probably kill you as soon as you get near it. Threatening and scowling mean they will attack if they think they have a change to kill you. Dubious means they don't attack but won't sell to you, and so on. NPCs can both see and attack through walls, so don't get near any buildings outside of Grobb, Ogguk, or Neriak unless you're already very sure of what's inside them. Zones with or adjacent to cities tend to have a lot of guards in them, too--and guards belonging to the other races are a serious threat to your well-being. Walk around carefully. Guards can swim, too--quickly.</p>
	<p>You're likely to spend most of this part of your career on the E side of the continent of Antonicus. Neriak may well become your home away from home after a while, and you will become very familiar with 'the tunnel', which is a cave bypassing Freeport and leading from North Ro to the East commons. </p><BR>
	 


Stats: I'd recommend 25 points into wisdom, the remaining 5 into combat stats. At various points in your career you *will* be getting into melee. Intelligence is simply too low to bother with trying to bring up using valuable starting points. None into charisma either--even though it's listed as a 'primary' stat, it's only used for a few spells later on and mostly for dealing with merchants. Charisma can be brought up pretty easily with items and your own shaman buffs. Mine is base 45 and when I need to I can bring it up to 78.

Starting out: 
	<P>You begin near the Innothule Swamp zone, opposite end of Grobb from your guild. Don't cross the water: go the other way. Run down and take the cave between Hergor on your right and a froglok prisoner or your left. Keep going--you will pass Krung's Clubs and Junk on your right, and a pair of merchants to your left. Go through the next cave and into an open area--Carver Cagrek will be in the middle. To your right are a gathering of merchants standing outside the door. From these merchants you will buy most of your spells, spell levels from left to right facing them. Your guild is through the door and up the stairs. Guildmistress Kaglari is off to the left of the lava pool. Do not jump into the lava: lava is bad for trolls. Give Kaglari your guild note, then hail her for your 1st quest.</P>
<P>To get to the Innothule and immediately begin adventuring, head back all the way you came, but this time *do* cross the water on the right hand side and go past the Priest of Discord. Giving the priest of Discord the PvP note is NOT recommended--just trash your note. Becoming PvP on a non-PvP server is a bad idea, as no-one will be able to cast beneficial spells on you, and virtually no-one else will be PvP to fight against.</p>
<p>If you cross the water on the left hand side, you will find basher Nanrum in a small cave--he gives a seldom-utilized quest. For 3 fire beetle eyes he gives a semi-precious stone worth a gold or two, or sometimes an earring which gives you +3 AC. Those are worth keeping until you can afford something better, like +3 WIS earrings. I don't recommend fighting fire beetles at 1st level, and in any event the closest are found (rarely) in South Ro and in the Feerot. You may want to wait until 5th lvl as then you get the 'Gate' spell for easier travel (it returns you to your binding point, which right now is in the swamp just outside Grobb). At 5th, I'd recommend a nice spot in the Rathe Mountains. By then the beetles themselves don't pose much of a threat, and are plentiful in this spot. Watch out for wandering bears and lizardmen by pressing F9 until you get a nice wide view around you while you fight, and you should be fine--assuming you made it there and managed to avoid any nasties. Sometimes cyclopes and giant skeletons and the like will wander through the valleys of the Rathe Mountains, but can be avoided with care. Getting there: From Grobb, mostly hug the zone wall directly to the left facing out. I say mostly because a nasty little human postal worker (bard mail run) stays near the wall a little ways past the bashers.  Watch out for him, then hug the wall again all the way to the Feerot zone and you should be fine. Zone into Feerot, hug the wall again left and again watch out for another nasty postal loon--these guys are deep red at this point and KOS (kill-on-sight) to you. He is shortly to the left of the zone point. After him, keep hugging the zone wall until you get to the water. Follow the water all the way to the big bridge (before then you will come to a fallen stone across the water--that ain't it). From the bridge, cross river and stay on the main path (take no turn-offs) all the way to the Rathe Mountains. At the Rathe Mountains, take a right at the 4-way intersection. Go until the area opens up and you'll see some ruins. The beetles are plentiful just off to the left of that.</P>
<P>Other quests--hail Hergor and follow the instructions. It's an amusing quest, but don't expect to get more than a few pieces of armor from it as the spores are a rare drop and you need 4 for each piece. Carver Cagrek gives 2 quests. The one he presents when you speak to him is the Grobb Cleaver quest (he wants HEHE meat). It's well detailed at various spoiler sites, but keep in mind the completion includes killing a 20th lvl baddie so don't worry about it for now. The baddie is alone and is a non-caster, the Grobb Cleaver is warrior/shadow knight only useable. This makes it great if you partner/group with a troll or ogre of those classes--it's a nice weapon (2H-slashing, damage 15 delay 45, magic, +3 STR +3 INT +3 DEX). The quest within reach I can't for the life of me remember how to get him to talk about. I've heard he doesn't even give it until your 3rd level, but I tried getting a lvl 3 troll shaman and a lvl 4 troll shadow knight to get him to spill the beans and he said nothing. In any event: give him 3 froglok meats (unstacked as for most quests) and exactly 10 gold (not 100 silver, not 1 platinum), and he will give you the Grobb Oven Mitts: hand-slot armor AC 4, magic, +5 resist fire. I'll probably keep wearing mine until I get the Totemic gloves--any additional fire resistance for a troll is good, and besides, it's one of those rare, curiosity-type items.</P>  
<P>I do not recommend spending the initial skill points on anything which will rise on its own, such as piercing or spell skills. Whenever possible, save skill points for trade skills and the occasional 1 point to get a skill going (like 1 point into meditation once available at 8th level). Switch use between 1H blunt, 2H blunt, and piercing from the start--these skills are much more difficult to raise at later levels.</P> 
	<P>Get a 'Crude Stein' as soon as you can. These nifty things are held in one hand, raise STA by 10, and CHR by 15. I'm never without mine dealing with merchants. They are obtained from the Bouncers, the guard troops of Ogguk the ogre city. You needn't kill any ogre guards--during prime playing hours high levels sit there often, killing guard after guard just outside (or more likely inside, since the recent guard upgrade) Ogguk. The crude steins are lore, meaning nobody can ever have more than one. From Innothule, the easiest and safest way to reach Ogguk is simply to take a hard right and hug the zone wall until you get there. </P>
<font color="#d6000">Levels 1 ~ 7: </FONT><br>
	<p>The Innothule is a delightful newbie zone--you can obtain wearable armor from kills starting with the lowly froglok tad, and those pieces you already have sell for a gold or so each. Kill tads for the loot and the fleshes for the quest (although otherwise seems implied, I've yet to hear of anyone getting better than that one spell), skeletons for the same quest and their weapons (if you ever see any skelly with a staff, it could be that wonderful cracked staff worth almost a plat even for a troll to sell), and kobolds as they sometimes loot free containers.</p>	
<p>Kill all the lesser snakes you see as you will need their skins for a spell component which you'll use frequently. Stay pretty much within sight of the bashers at 1st, so as to avoid getting lost. As you gain levels, steadily hunt your way down the wall (to the right leaving Grobb). Always pull things to the wall, with your back to it. Frogloks have a large call-for-help range and pulling just one can be tricky--often help arrives for them from just behind a tree. Froglok trains will happen a lot, so when the odds start to look bad just run them back to the bashers (train: the player(s) is the engine, followed by multiple 'cars' of baddies chasing him because a fight got out of hand and he was forced to run). With that nice troll STA, you can jump often enough to outdistance most anything even without a 'speedyfoots mojo' (Spirit of Wolf, AKA SoW) going.</P>
	<p>Most likely you will eventually end up camping the 2 froglok guards just outside Guk, which is nice steady XP especially if the spawn is kept broken apart (keeping the spawning times of fixed location baddies far enough apart that you face as few as possible at a time becomes vital as the game progresses for those total newbies reading this). As I recall the guards range from 5th to 7th level. Odd point of note: if frogloks are chasing you and you run onto the ledge area in front of Guk, they tend to give up the chase and you will only have to deal with the guards themselves. As you progress in level, you will be able to take on kobold hunters, all the froglok types in the Innothule, all the fungus types in the Innothule (probable exception the Fungus Guardian), and the various alligators. Near the Guk area can be found wandering the occasional NPC 'hummie type'--mostly human, dwarf and elf paladins in their teen levels. These will kill you if you come within aggro range (aggro range=aggresive range, how close you need to be before they chase after you). Even the white and blue con ones hit pretty hard, so watch out.</P> 
<P>Going inside of Guk itself will be tempting from as early as maybe 5th level, but I don't generally recommend it. Reason 1: trains--at any moment, including just zoning in, you may get swamped by a horde of high level frogloks brought to the zone by someone else--Guk is one of those places where even a competent and well organized group can have a hard time stopping every train. Reason 2: a relatively high level (9th or so) froglok sentry spawns right near the zone and tends to surprise you, coming up behind and turning the tide of a battle you were winning.</P>
	<p>Taking on the actually poisonous giant water moccasins will also be tempting once you get the cure poison spell, but keep in mind their poison is nasty, and takes generally 3 castings of that spell to cure. Do *not* attempt to solo these--at least get a partner and have him/her hotkey something like 'me ben poyzund!' so that you don't waste any mana. Begin fights with warning and with full mana, with a warrior partner or a group, and hunting these for the giant snake fangs (also a decent low lvl pure caster weapon), poison sacks, etc. can be pretty profitable. Whether you take on blue, white, or yellow cons depends on your group size. Advisable in any event to stay out of melee yourself and save all the mana for cures and healing those doing the barshin. If you're in combat you could get poisoned, which means 3 cures and probly at least a heal or two of mana spent right there--the amount of damage you do in melee versus what a warrior does won't be worth that. If the snake aggro's on you or (gods forbid) you go down, the whole group is probably screwed. </P>

	<P>The rare spawning Fungus Guardian drops a head which can be turned in to the guildmaster of the troll shadow knights for the Froglok Skin Mask, a decent magic item. As I recall, this baddie is around 10th level. He doesn't have a ton of HPTs or hit very hard, but his special ability of 'clockwork poison' or whatever will tend to keep you spinning and incapacitated continuously, making him difficult to solo. For variety from camping the Guk guards, there's a peninsula jutting out a bit south of the S Ro zone point where a lot of giant water mocassins and alligator types can be found. If you're lucky enough to get an alligator skin (from the bulls I believe), plenty of higher level halflings will be willing to pay well (20pp and more) for it because it's one of several items for a very nice halfling quest. If you find an arm on a fat alligator, that's for a quest in Ogguk--I forget the details.</P><br>
<font color="#d6000">Levels 7 ~ 14:</FONT><br>
<P>After hitting 7th or so, gaining XP in the swamp becomes harder, and it's about time to move on. One option is an isolated camp of lizard-men in the Rathe Mountains zone. I forget the exact level, but I believe they're doable from about 6th level onwards with a group. The advantages there are they're not at all likely to be camped even Saturday evening during prime time, there are troll guards nearby to run to, and merchants very near as well. Disadvantage of course is the distance from Grobb or Ogguk if you actually do get killed. This camp is tricky to get to if you don't know the Rathe Mountains very well--head straight through the 1st intersection from the Feerot zone. Keep heading W past the obelisk protected by the named beetles--they're not that tough, but they are KOS to anyone and annoying, and the troll guards will not protect you from them. If you're careful you can just go right between them every time with a little practice--approach the obelisk area slowly to figure out exactly where they are. Take the path choice from there keeping you headed W or you'll end up heading to the Lake Rathe area. Soon you'll come to a camp where ogres and troll merchants hang out, and a bit past that are a couple of trolls guarding...something, and the lizzie camp should be within sight of them at around 2500, 2200. Other lizard camps as well as orc camps can be found in this zone, but none have guards a troll needs to be running to.</p>
	<p>More convenient are the plethora of orc camps on the grassy (read: safe) part of the South Ro zone, adjacent to the Innothule. They range in number from a nice little 2 orc camp where my partner and I went from 7th to 9th to camps of 5 or 6 orcs. The loot isn't bad, the XP is very steady and it's a nice place to learn spawn breaking if you're not familiar with that fine art already. The hardest part is always breaking the spawn--if they're are mostly yellow con, spell-casting type orcs when you approach it, you'd best pray to whatever deity you chose. For those who don't know already, camps will spawn baddies of variable level and type, and the casters will often heal/buff themselves and their fellows. NPC spell casters never seem to fizzle, rarely if ever run out of mana, are difficult to interrupt while casting because the needn't worry about lag...generally do things which make a PC caster turn even greener with envy--ALWAYS gang up on the caster first. While camping them the only other baddies you might run into are cheezy jackals (might attack you while you meditate), maybe the occasional skeleton, and rarely someone will have trained something down from the nastier part of S Ro which might wander back past you. Typically that would be mummies or maybe even a Drybones Skeleton--from those, RUN.</P>
<P>Hitting 9th level means the all-important Spirit of Wolf (much more fun to call it speedyfoots or doggyfoots mojo). Once you've had it for a few hours, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. And of course don't be ashamed to make some money here. The best way to do that is to ask for a donation when someone wants a SoW. Don't specify. Most of the time you'll get around a plat for it. Less from lower level characters is understandable (though anything under a gold is a bit insulting--they could have at least gone and killed that second orc pawn), and from high levels I've gotten 10 plat once or twice, and a GLS once--I was AFK while the guy was asking to pay for a SoW, and apparently he thought I was driving a hard bargain by maintaining my silence. I let him know what was up ooc after I got back to my keyboard and told him he (being an inkie) didn't need to go that far, but he was a good sport and gave it anyway. Also if anyone offers trading 'Clarity' or even 'Breeze' for a SoW, agree. If it's clarity don't even think about it--just give them a tell ASAP saying sure, where can I meet you? If you're badly strapped for cash you might even sit down in a zone (either side of the N Ro--E Commons tunnel is a good place) auctioning/ shouting that you'll cast it, other buffs, heal/cure etc for donations. Roleplaying that well gets more and better donations than otherwise. To go with RPing in my case I wouldn't give a free one to a 'goodly' type race unless *maybe* it was obviously for a corpse run and they were polite and tactful about it. With trolls I never charged, and at this point I never charge trolls, ogres, or usually inkies (dark elves) unless they're snooty or rude about it. In fact when I have mana to spare I sometimes run through a zone zapping it off on anyone of evil race and running off before they know what hit them. With the 'goodly' types I'll usually do one if they're asking nicely for it, and especially if they show some good role-play.</p>
	<P> Around this level you'll want to consider killing (barshin) wisps--the rare yield of a GLS (greater light stone) can mean 10 or more platinum *if* you have a friend with a good charisma and indifferent faction or better. Do NOT attempt to do the GLS quest at the inkie merchant camp in S Ro. As a troll you only have apprehensive faction with them, but that is not good enough and you will only waste your GLS in the attempt. You'll need an inkie friend, although I know an erudite or (eck) gnome necro can do it. Cazik forbid you're grouping with some sort of goodly type--they have to do the goodly version of the quest all the way over in West Karanas. Along this same line: faction with the Dark Bargainers (inkie merchants) can be raised all the way to warm quite easily by giving bottles of red wine to Lokar Tobiath in the library of Neriak in the Neriak Third Quarter zone, but this requires indifferent faction to begin with. Easy way for a purchasing friend to get the best prices. If anyone knows how to get it from apprehensive to indifferent to begin with, please let me know. Wisps of course require magic weapons to hit, and are mostly found in the East and West Commons zones. The guards there will be KOS to you, and there is also the ever-present danger of a Griffin swooping down, so you must remain on you big warty toes.</P>
<P>For the early to mid double-digit range here, wisps and various giant snakes are probably best for loot, and also hacking away at dervish camps with a group as soon as you can is good profit (gud fer to git da shinies). The closest derv camp to Grobb is up near the W wall in S Ro, a little onto the sandy part of the zone. You may want to get re-bound in Neriak sometime around now, but with SoW the world is a smaller place anyway.</P> 
	<P>If you need XP more than loot, you can level pretty quickly hunting basilisks starting from 12th-ish (NOT alone) all the way to mid-late teens. Basilisks are nasty to solo because of their stoning (long stun, essentially) ability, and that has a decent range too--it's not by biting. They give really great XP though. These range up to 16th or so level (maybe 17th-ish) and can be found in abundant supply in the Rathe Mountains, which I have *never* seen overcrowded. From the Feerot zone, take a left at the intersection, stay near the right wall after that until it opens up. You'll pass an undead camp and eventually get to prime bazzie grounds. At this point you might want to acquire a mystic doll from a lizardman shaman for novelty purposes--its +3 charisma and no drop, can't be held alongside a crude stein, but most people don't have and many have never seen or heard of them.</p><br>
<font color="#d6000">Levels 14 ~ 20</font><br>

	<p>Level 14 means more freedom--you can now set your own binding point (where you appear again after dying or casting the 'Gate' spell). The melee classes never get the ability to do this, and must be bound within cities by others; meaning a lot of annoying running if things go awry.</p>
	<p>The various Karanas offer a number of decent things to hunt--mostly lone wanderings, but the only place a Troll can sell here is at the centaur stables in S K on the north side of the zone. Banking is out of the question. Getting back from anywhere in the Karanas you can bank means going through either Highhold Pass (not recommended if you're a visible troll) or running across a guarded bridge from N K to S K (also not recommended for visible trolls). The merchants are dubious, and a number of gypsies and guards want very much to barsh yooz gud.</P> 
	<P>Oasis is the most popular zone. Therefore it's overcrowded, there's a lot of KSing (kill-stealing) and accusations, the air is filled nasty /shouts and /ooc chat, the lag is worse, and so on. Blech. At least none of the NPCs here are KOS, though the only merchant who will sell to you (a gypsy from whom you must buy some of your spells) doesn't give the greatest prices. To find the gypsy, head W from the docks along the N edge of the lake. The only part I might recommend hunting here is known as 'Orc Highway', a pass just north of the Oasis lake itself near the W cliff wall of the zone (just follow the N lake shore past the gypsy camp). Orcs walk past here in a continuous stream, and can be pulled with relative safety. Be careful as the level range is pretty wide--some are blue, some green, then the occasional 'super orc'--red con, and a real prize for XP. I think those are always warriors.</P>
<p>A great place for loot is the so-called Sister's Island in the Ocean of Tears zone. Getting there is slightly tricky, but not a real problem once you learn how. From Oasis, follow the beach into N Ro until you get to the fishing village. Hard left along the edge of the sand to avoid guards until you hit the W wall, go N along the W wall into E FP. keep going until you can't go any further N and you'll be at an abandoned gypsy camp. In the corner is an illusory wall, just walk right through. Take all right turns in the tunnels below the city--it's safe, nobody is KOS to you down there. You'll eventually get to a cave leading out into the ocean--I recommend binding here. From here a little swimming is required. There is a single shark who sits over a chest used for some rogue quest or other, I think he's green con by this point but I never had a problem with him anyway. On the shore during the day is a red-con NPC who is KOS to you, during the night is a blue or maybe green con inkie who is apprehensive. I've no idea what either is good for, just watch out for the hummie one. Swim all the way to the stairs part of the docks--to your left is a barbarian whom I think is dubious--I never had a problem with him. You can get back out of the water here, but be careful--a single guard patrols the docks. He's very nasty, and his patrol takes him in and out of the 2 buildings on either side. Make sure he's not around then sprint to the end of the docks. The chick fishing is KOS to you, but very weak, and not likely to attack unless you sit down to meditate. Take the boat--it's the one that goes to the Butcherblock Mountains and the rest of Faydwer, but it goes to the Ocean of Tears before that.  The correct island should be the 1st one on your right into the zone. I recommend jumping ship to get to it before the ship docks--the Sisters at the end of the docks seem to be in the odd habit of con'ing indiff but attacking anyway. I also don't recommend binding here unless you have a friend who can invis you (we don't get invis ourselves until 29th lvl!). The Sisters of Erollisi are lone wanderings, common on the island. Pull them to the beach--they will help each other out when they can, and some of them are named and much tougher. They loot: rusty halberds (heard bronze sometimes, never got one), purity belts (w/ a 78 chr I can sell them for well over a plat to inkies) about 9/10 times, and occasionally wood elf parts for baking. Faction goes down with all sorts of goodly elves (bah), and up with the Crushbone Orcs. These ladies can be smacked around before 14th, it just depends. I suggest making a trip just to /con them when you can. Getting CB orc faction up past KOS has amusing uses--you can walk freely throughout Crushbone, say hi to the emperor...watch with evil amusement as all the little dwarves and goodly elves get smacked around...also, you can kill CB slaves unmolested--killing the Elf slaves is good for inkie warrior/guard faction, and the elves and dwarves both yield meat for baking (for halfling meat go to Nektulos).</P>
	<p>Lake Rathetear is nice too--at the mid teens with a group you can camp the Gnolls just outside the South Karana zone: this is where the Runed Totem Staff and the Skull of Jhen'Tra are obtained. If you're brave enough to swim here when low level you might be able to get them for free, as they're lore items. At later teens you can camp the Aviak Guards located in various places around the zone--just do a camp check /ooc and go to whatever is open. I've never had a problem with camp stealing nor have a ever had to impose the 'play nice' policy on anyone so far: if you exercise a modicum of diplomacy most people respond in kind. My partner and I got from 18ish to 20th camping a single Aviak camp--the 'cove' camp near the hermit in the SW corner. It's rather out of the way and inconvenient to anyone who can't simply levitate and run over the water. Ah, that trick. Once you get the wonderful levitate spell, to lev over water just tilt your view slightly up and you'll never sink into the water.</P>
<P>You can also get through the last of the teens in Unrest all the way over on Faydwer--jumping ship just after it starts to leave again you can avoid the guards (swim to shore just after that wall), but getting back on the boat to go home is trickier. Getting to Unrest is also a fair run and a guide will probably be needed. Once in Unrest, you *will* need a good strong group, preferably with people at 20th-ish level, and don't even try to be the group puller with that giant green butt of yours. All this amounts to Unrest being a more...advanced option. </P><br>


<P><font color="#d6000">Trade skills:</font> The combination of low intelligence and low charisma makes mastering most trade skills impractical for a troll, but at least a shaman has wisdom going. I chose to master baking and brewing, leaving the rest for others--perhaps when I'm swimming in platinum and 40th level I'll master the rest. Useful hint for all trade skills: to pick up only 1 item from a stack, hold down the ctrl button when you click on it.</P> 
	<P>Fishing is surprisingly good to learn, mostly for indirect reasons. The rod and bait (all you need) can be purchased from the female merchant in Grobb nearest the Innothule zone point. Between fishing casts, you can continuously work on direction sense (terribly difficult to get going, though easy enough to keep maxed and eventually will be useful), and you can also keep your spell skills maxed at the same time. Use your cheapest (mana-wise) spell to improve spell skill--for divination skill, cast 'true north' over and over again. Spell skills max out at 5 * your level +5. The higher your skill is in something, the less likely you are to fizzle when casting, which will be very important in a fight. Fishing skill maxes out at the same rate. Fish serve as food, which saves money buying rations. The rusty daggers are of little use unless you're ambitious enough to want to learn smithing (takes a lot of platinum and time), the scales are a component for 'enduring breath', a spell shamans get after a while, the shoes are useless to a large race. Fish can be sold, and also can be used for baking, which has no level-based maximum.</P>
	<P>Baking is ideal for a troll--the appetites of a troll are (in)famous. After getting skill to about 60, most recipes for cooking up other PC races become trivial (meaning failed attempts are rare), and even a troll can make some money as a baker. As with brewing, a lot of recipes require foraged items--no troll can forage. Baking is a matter of placing the required ingredients in an oven or a spit (though some recipes require other things, you won't need them to master the skill), hitting the 'combine' button, and hoping you skill is good enough to result in a new product. It is quite possible to loot/buy the items which will take you all the way up to 135 skill (100 being master). The down side to baking is that it's awfully hard to learn in Grobb. Grobb doesn't even have an oven, though Ogguk does. A spit is a portable oven, but is not available in any evil city--you must have a friend buy you one in Freeport. Grobb has no supplier of infinite fish for purchase, either. Ogguk does, but it's Chef Dooga, who won't sell anything to a troll. Neriak has 3 ovens and most baking ingredients available for purchase, making it the ideal evil baking city.</P> 
Easy progression: saving all skill points, at 4th level you can put 20 all into baking.<br> 

<P>Batwing crunchies: trivial at skill 51 (bat wing + frosting combined in oven) frosting I believe is available from a merchant in the Grobb bar area near the warriors guild, but the closest place I know of for infinite batwings is an erudite name Firespinner in the East Commons zone, in one of the buildings at the last inn before zoning west into the West Commons. Bat wings are also required for the levitation spell--you will likely see a lot of this woman, as she is one of the few faction-immune merchants who will not only sell to you, but sell components and all at pretty good prices. </p.

<P>Fish fillets: trivial at skill 88 (fresh fish + jug of sauces combined in oven) this creates 2 servings, meaning that once you can produce them regularly you can turn a profit, especially if you fished up the ingredients yourself. The only place I know of where a troll can purchase infinite fish is in the Neriak Commons, a merchant standing (hiding?) behind a fountain will sell them. The Refined Palate in the Neriak Commons near the bank is where I gained most of my baking skill--merchants there sell the sauces and such, plus it has an oven inside the shop.</P>  

<P>Fish rolls: trivial at skill 135 (fresh fish + bat wing combined in oven) not made for profit, just raising skill with these</P>

<P>Brewing: Not for profit, strictly for fun and RP. Note: while brewing has no level cap on skill, alcohol tolerance does. Again due to the inconvenience of ingredients, I strongly recommend learning this one in Neriak. In Neriak all the needed ingredients can be obtained from 2 floors of a single bar in the Foreign Quarter zone (left side of the Foreign Quarter going into Neriak), and the still in which you combine them is right nearby against the wall in front of another bar. Oh--the bar might not have the water, but that can be bought on the other side of that zone from the Gobbler. The cask is the only unstackable ingredient, but if your skill attempt fails at least the cask isn't used up.<P> 

<P>Easy progression: 20 saved up points from trainer into it if at all possible--52 intelligence really needs a good head start on anything.</P>
Short Beer: trivial at skill 31 (hops + malt + barley + cask)<BR>
