Verant's Play Nice Rules   
This is an exact copy of the Producer Letter as posted on the Everquest website. It is reproduced here for your reference.  </P> 
  

  
3/14/2000

<P>Hello Everyone,</P>
<P>
Back in October, Jeff Butler, EverQuest’s Customer Service Manager, outlined some new Customer Service Guidelines in the Producer’s Letter. Shortly after these policies were publicized, we announced that their implementation would be postponed pending some revisions necessary to insure enforceability and consistency across the servers and different levels of our Customer Service organization. Last week, our policy team completed their public revision of those policies, and we are ready to implement them at this time. Before we get in to the wording of the "Play Nice Policies", I’d like to take a moment to discuss their spirit, and why we feel that they are necessary.
</P><P>
EverQuest continues to astound everyone involved with it almost daily. Nearly one year since we opened our doors, EverQuest boasts a community of current players numbering nearly 200,000, most of whom still play on a daily basis. In all actuality, EverQuest has gone beyond what could be described with a term such as "community". We are all, in fact, part of the EverQuest Society. </P><P>

Like any society, each person has the ability to place his or her mark upon it. The vast majority of people in our society do their best to insure that their mark is positive, by abiding to the laws that we, much like the government, bring forward. Some of you choose to become pinnacles of honor, dignity, and respect in your individual communities by forming guilds, promoting honorable actions by your members, and by supporting EverQuest on your web-sites. </P><P>

Also like any society, we have our underbelly, a relatively small number of people who live to prey upon the honorable. It is frequently the goal of these people to see to their desires, no matter the effect of their actions upon others around them. They are the ones who claim ownership of servers, zones, or spawns, and cause or threaten harm to anyone who does not share their disregard and contempt. They are the ones who live, not to enjoy the game with everyone else, but to enjoy at everyone else’s expense. </P><P>

For the first few months after EverQuest’s release, we felt that a policy of non-interference in many of these matters was warranted. However, we continued to lose good players. This was not due to any deficiency or dissatisfaction in the game, but due to dissatisfaction with the treatment that they received from their fellow players, and the perceived inability of our Customer Service department to intervene. Late last year, we made a commitment to our players to begin playing an active role in many of these situations.</P><P>

The intent of these policies is to provide the players with general guidelines for what is or is not acceptable behavior in EverQuest, and give them with the opportunity to work out differences prior to involving the EverQuest Customer Service Staff. Naturally, in a game as multifaceted as EverQuest, we are not able to cover every possible issue that could arise as part of these policies. In these cases, it is the spirit of a rule that will prevail over any discrepancies in the letter. </P><P>

Play Nice Policies: 
A revision to the GM/Guide FAQ and the Rules of Conduct.
The policies below are now in effect and will be reflected in the GM – Guide/Conduct FAQ in the near future.</P><P>

<font color="d6000">Kill Stealing</font><BR>

Kill Stealing will now be regarded as disruption and will result in disciplinary action when witnessed by any EverQuest Customer Service Representative (EQCSR). The EQCSR will review these situations on an individual basis and issue a decision which is considered binding upon all parties involved. Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of a mob for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group. </P><P>

The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy. 
</P><P>
<font color="d6000">Contested Spawns</FONT><BR>

There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same thing. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a binding compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise mandated by an EQCSR will be considered disruption. It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.</P><P>

Note: A "group" in this case is defined as a party of one or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are capable of completing that goal. </P><P>

<font color="d6000">Foul Language</font><BR>

Excessive use of foul language in an inappropriate context, including swear words, real-world racial slurs, and other language that is not consistent with the fantasy environment and designed to hurt, will be considered a disruption. The existence of the filter (/filter) is not a license to be profane. </P><P>

<font color="d6000">Harassment</font> <BR>

Harassment is defined as specifically targeting another player or group of players to harm or inconvenience them. Harassment can take many forms, as it goes to the state-of-mind of the person or party on the receiving end of the action. However, in order to account for those who are excessively thin-skinned, the EQCSR involved will make a determination as to whether or not the average person would feel "harassed" and act accordingly.</P><P>

<font color="d6000">Zone/Area Disruption </font><BR>

Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or inconvenience a number of groups rather than a specific player or group of players. This includes things such as:</P><P>

Monopolizing most or all of the kills in an area. <BR>



Deliberately blocking a doorway or narrow area so other players cannot get past. <BR>
Refusing to cooperate with the other parties at a contested spawn site after having been instructed to do so by an EQCSR. <BR>



Making excessive and inappropriate use of zone-wide communications (/shout, /ooc, /auction). <BR>


<font color="d6000">Reports of Fraud </font><BR>

Fraud in all transactions between players will result in disciplinary action when confirmed by an internal EQCSR. Fraud is defined as falsely representing one’s intentions to make a gain at another’s expense.</P><P>


Examples of this activity include but are not limited to offering to recover possessions from the corpse of another player and refusing to return that property to it’s owner as well as using flaws in a secure trade window to deprive someone of one of their items.</P><P>

<font color="d6000">Guilds</font><BR>

Disciplinary issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a broader basis. Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct or Play Nice Policies may be disbanded. In addition, monopolizing numerous spawn areas with the intent to exclude other players will not be permitted. If investigated and verified by an internal EQCSR, monopolizing will result in the disbanding of the guild. </P><P>



<font color="d6000">Training NPCs</font><BR>

The intentional training of NPCs will result in immediate disciplinary action when witnessed by an EQCSR. We are aware that accidents often happen causing unintentional trains, and will scrutinize each report of this activity closely. </P><P>

<font color="d6000">Abuse</font><BR>

Though the following have always been in the GM/Guide FAQ, this letter is probably a good place to reiterate some of the items that we consider abuse:</P><P>

Hate Mongering - participation in or propagation of Hate literature, behavior, or propaganda related to real -world characteristics. </P><P>

Sexual Abuse or Harassment - untoward and unwelcome advances of a graphic and sexual nature. This includes virtual rape, overt sexual overtures, and stalking of a sexual nature. </P><P>

Attempting to Defraud a CS Representative - Petitioning with untrue information with the intention of receiving benefits as a result. This includes reporting bug deaths, experience or item loss, or accusing other players of wrongdoing without basis for it. </P><P>

Impersonating a Customer Service Representative - falsely representing yourself to another player as a Guide or a Verant Interactive employee. </P><P>

CS Personnel Abuse - sending excessive /tells to a CS Representative, excessively using say or other channels to communicate to a CS Representative, making physical threats, or
using abusive language against a CS Representative. 
</P><P>
Using Threats of Retribution by GM Friends - attempting to convince another player that they have no recourse in a disagreement because favoritism is shown to one of the parties by the Verant Interactive or Guide staff. </P><P>

It is recommended that players make judicious use of the /report command when reporting abuse. The proper course of action is to file a /report, then file a petition informing the EverQuest Customer Service Staff that a /report has been filed. </P><P>

 





[Editor's Note: The following is PvP Server specific]
</P><P>
 

<font color="d6000">PvP Servers</font><BR>

The PvP Servers are a special case for many of the policies listed here. When one makes the decision to play on a PvP Server, they are in essence agreeing to play on a server where compromise is decided on the basis of who has the power to kill whom. </P><P>

By the same token, we expect that the people on those servers will apply PvP combat in all situations where it is called for, as a resolution to the problem. As such, the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will decline to intervene in cases where a PvP alternative exists, such as at disputed spawns where the parties involved have the ability to attack each other.</P><P>

Though the PvP environment does eliminate a few of the problems experienced on the normal servers, there are a few more PvP-specific problems that are created.</P><P>

<font color="d6000">Causing Experience Loss</font><BR>

Intentionally causing experience-loss to other players in the PvP environment is illegal in all cases and will result in a warning when witnessed by an EQCSR. This includes things such as intentionally training NPCs, and purposefully allowing an NPC to get the final blow in combat. We do understand that there are cases where the experience-loss is unintentional, and will take no action unless a person earns a reputation of causing unintentional experience-loss. 
</P><P>
Much like how the Kill Stealing rule applies to those on the blue servers, this rule is designed to discourage and make note of those who do it habitually, thus betraying the spirit of PvP. As a note, the EQCSR will not in any case provide a resurrection for someone who was caused experience loss in PvP, intentionally or otherwise. This is one of the dangers of playing on a PvP server. 
</P><P>
<font color="d6000">Bind-point/Corpse Camping</font><BR>

Killing someone over and over again while at his or her bind-point or while they are in the process of retrieving their corpse is illegal and will result in a warning when witnessed by an EQCSR. You are expected in all cases to give someone a reasonable amount of time to
recover their corpse an leave the area prior to attacking again. 
</P><P>
Conversely, the person recovering their corpse is expected to do so and retreat to safety promptly. In other words, sitting next to your corpse and taunting someone while daring them to attack you so that you can /petition them is bad form, and would result in a warning if
witnessed by an EQCSR. 
</P><P>
The EQCSR in attendance will decide what is reasonable in these cases. It is highly recommended that the people involved make equitable arrangements prior to involving the EverQuest Customer Service Staff. </P><P>

[Editor's note: End of PvP specifics]</P><P>




<font color="d6000">Roleplay</font><BR>

Though EverQuest is a Role-playing game, the claim of "Role-play" will not be accepted in defense of any to "Train" a guard onto an enemy in protection of your homeland. In another example, a rogue is not allowed to steal someone’s corpse under the guise of role-playing a thief. 
</P><P>
By all means we want to encourage you to play your role, we just cannot allow that role-play to be done at another’s out-of-game expense. </P><P>

To quote the Producer’s Letter from October 20, 1999, Verant GM-Administrators review records of disciplinary incidents on a daily basis. Action is taken based on the severity and nature of the offense, and/or the number of warnings issued to the customer. These actions may include but are not limited to, temporary suspension or permanent banning from the game. Be advised that you may not receive any notification or warnings, in-game or otherwise, prior to disciplinary action being taken against your account.</P><P>

We ask that everyone give these new policies some time before judging their effectiveness. Our intent is to further our philosophy that no one player should ever be allowed to intentionally ruin the gameplay experience of another, a philosophy to which we are firmly committed. These policies will continue to adapt as we learn new ways to deal with particular issues, and discover new issues that need to be specifically addressed. </P><P>

Thank you,
