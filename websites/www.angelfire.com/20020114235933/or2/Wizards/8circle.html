<H4>EIGHTH CIRCLE SPELLS (From Grimstaff)</H4>
<P>All notes from Grimstaff</P>
<P><B>Bonds of Force</B> A snare area effect spell with the same radius area as the Pillar and Column line of spells.  With Spirit of the Wolf and the right kinds of creatures, you can use this and some AE spells in time to kite several monsters at once.
It will only slow up to 4 creatures, plus you if you are in the radius of effect.</P>
<P><B>Energy Storm</B> Another Rain spell, this time magic based.  This spell is researched with Rune of Karana, Rune of Xegony, and Rune of Fulguration.</P>
<P><B>Evacuate: North</B> Your first Evac spell, teleporting all in your party who are nearby to the huge stone arches in North Karana.  This spell casts much faster than the Portal spell to this area, but has
the added drawback of occasionally leaving a party member behind (this can even be you).  Set up a hot key so everyone knows whats going on, and make sure the party knows that if it gets hairy to stick close
and keep the monsters off you.  Hammer it many times, because in a battle a few messages can be missed in all the 'battle spam.'</P>
<P><B>Fay Portal</B> Group Teleport to Greater Faydark.  Teleports everyone closeby to you in your group to the huge stone arches in Greater Faydark.  Be a good Wizard and don't charge unless someone really pulls
you away from something important.</P>
<P><B>Imbue Fire Opal</B> Enchants a Fire Opal to be used in various smithing and trade skills.  Will only work if you are a worshipper of Solusek Ro, and can only be purchased in ... Nagafen's Lair.  It is tradable, so you can have someone go get it
while on other pursuits, if you really think its a good idea to have.</P>
<P><B>Inferno Shock</B> The big attack you will use most often at this level.  Finally, after 12 levels, another fire-based attack!</P>
<P><B>Magnify</B> Lets you see things further off as if they are closer.  For the same effect with no mana use, put a small box on your screen and turn the resolution down several notches.</P>
<P><B>North Portal</B> Group Teleport to North Karana.  Teleports everyone closeby to you in your group to the huge stone arches in North Karana.Be a good Wizard and don't charge unless someone really pulls
you away from something important.</P>
<P><B>Shock Spiral of Al'Kabor</B> Another one of Al's fine spells that uses up huge mana and does less damage than spells several circles lower.  Research only, using Rune of Rallos Zek, Rune of Al'Kabor, Rune of the Helix.</P>
<P><B>Thunder Strike</B> An upgrade to the level 20 spell Shock of Force.  This spell does a LOT of damage, plus it interrupts the target's spellcasting.  It also has a fun side effect of sending most targets flying away from you with the blast if it is not resisted.
If you are facing a lot of casters, get this, Force Shock, and Tishan's Class up and cycle between then to annihilate the foe and prevent spellcasting.  All or nothing, but it seems to be resisted at this level less than Force Shock was at level 20.</P>
<P><B>Tox Portal</B> Group Teleport to Toxxulia Forest.  Teleports everyone closeby to you in your group to the huge stone arches in Toxxulia Forest, which understandibly is not used often.  Be a good Wizard and don't charge 
unless someone really pulls you away from something important.  This spell can also be researched using Rune of Combine, Rune of Dismemberment, and Rune of Regeneration.</P>
<P><B>Yonder</B> The last of the random teleport spells, with the longest maximum range for teleporting of the three.  Yonder costs slightly more mana than Shadowstep and Fade, and has the potential to fling you VERY far from where you were, if conditions 
are ideal.  For extra amusement for your party, memorize all three and toggle between them.  Thrill to the fact this spell won't get you out of danger in any rough terrain, chill to the way it rarely ports you further than twenty feet away!</P>
