<td VALIGN=TOP><font color="#C0C0C0">These are a few of the most common
strategies used in battle by a necromancer.&nbsp; Use them to improve your
chances of defeating a creature.&nbsp; Of course, if you are new to any
of these, practice with easier creatures before you take on take yellow
opponent.&nbsp; If you believe I made a mistake or use any other strategy
that is not here, please send an <a href="mailto:skinner.tds@angelfire.com?subject=Battle Strategies">email</a>.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i><font color="#FFFF99">Michael Jackson on Loop</font></i>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">This is the strategy commonly used by young necromancers.&nbsp;
The first step is to pull a creature with a DoT or a debilitating spell.&nbsp;
Once the creature starts coming your way, send your pet and follow it.&nbsp;
Now you must engage in melee combat, hopefully inflicting some damage while
taking a few hits.&nbsp; Once you HPs drop down a little, step back and
cast a drain life spell to replenish lost HPs. Remember to step back far
enough so the critter can't reach you after the first cast.&nbsp;&nbsp;
After casting it 2 or 3 times, step back into melee combat and do the same
thing again.&nbsp; The main advantage of this strategy is that you can
spare your pet from taking too much damage.&nbsp; The main disadvantage
is that it sometimes does not work as the creature will go AGRO on you.&nbsp;
Oh and no, I am not a fan of Michael Jackson.</font>
<p><i><font color="#FFFF99">Run Forrest Run</font></i>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">This is best used when in a large area such as
the Commonlands or Karanas Plains.&nbsp; The first and very important step
is to check if your target creature is alone.&nbsp; You want to make sure
you are pulling only one creature.&nbsp; Once you find your target, cast
a DoT spell on it that you know is not likely to be resisted.&nbsp; The
darkness line of spells would work great as it reduces the speed of your
target.&nbsp; But Heat Blood also does a nice a job since it deals a larger
amount of damage.&nbsp; Remember to cast from a safe distance as you should
cast and run to a zone.&nbsp; You do not want the creature to reach you
as that would trigger your pet.&nbsp; You only want that to happen when
you reach the zone area.&nbsp; Once you do, turn around and wait for that
creature to arrive.&nbsp; It should be quite down on life if you hit it
far away.&nbsp; As soon as it gets close enough, send your pet and cast
away.&nbsp; You can either put some more DoTs on it, drain life, or send
it away again with Fear.&nbsp; The main advantage with this strategy is
that you can not only take tougher opponents but also be safely fighting
near a zone in case things go wrong.&nbsp; Of course, its main advantage
is that you might end up with more than one creature on your tail.</font>
<p><i><font color="#FFFF99">Fear me</font></i>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">Another commonly used strategy is the DoT/Fear.&nbsp;
Find yourself a target, stand back from a safe distance and send your pet.&nbsp;
As soon as you do, cast a Darkness spell and, if successful, Fear your
target.&nbsp; It is important to succeed when casting your Darkness spell
as you want the creature to move slowly so you can cast other spells.&nbsp;
If it is not successful, cast other DoTs and recast Darkness.&nbsp; If
resisted again, do not wait longer and Fear it right away.&nbsp; You will
have to get closer to creature to cast another spell otherwise it will
move out of range.&nbsp; Once Fear fades, recast it.&nbsp; Repeat this
until the creature is dead with occasional damage spells dealt while the
creature is running away.&nbsp; This strategy works best against opponents
that con blue as Fear will be resisted too often against tougher opponents.&nbsp;
Its main adavantage is that you will rarely take any hits, which is quite
a good thing against critters that can hit fast and hard.&nbsp; Of course,
the disavantage relies on the fact that necromancers are not great at fearing
creatures and it can either be resisted or work for a very brief amount
of time.</font>
<p><i><font color="#FFFF99">Master of the Undead</font></i>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">When hunting undead creatures in a team and specially
solo, Master of the Undead can work pretty well.&nbsp; There are plenty
of zones where fighting one undead only is quite a rarity.&nbsp; You target
an undead and his brother will join the battle instantly, making it a lot
harder to win.&nbsp; To improve the odds, here is what you should do.&nbsp;
Cast one of the Numb the Dead line of spells on one of the undeads.&nbsp;
It will lower its AGRO and force it to stand still for quite some time.&nbsp;
You now can fight the other undead alone.&nbsp; By the time you are done
with it, the other creature should either have just joined the battle or
about to.&nbsp; And killing this one now that the other is dead should
not be a problem.&nbsp; It is important to kill the first undead as fast
as you can to make sure you are done or close to it when the effects of
the Numb the Dead line of spells fades away.&nbsp; The main advantage of
this strategy is that it allows you to solo to creatures at the same time
reasonably easy.&nbsp; The disadvantage lies on the fact that your lowering
AGRO spell might either be resisted or fade away faster than you would
want.&nbsp; To reduce those chances, use this strategy at points on your
career when that spell is fairly new on your inventory.&nbsp; Thus, using
it at level 24, when you just got Rest the Dead will work better than using
Numb the Dead at level 22.</font>
<p><i><font color="#FFFF99">XP Boost</font></i>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">Use this strategy to boost your XP gain at the
cost of your beloved bone chips.&nbsp; To use it, make sure you familiar
with your target.&nbsp; You want to know how much damage it can deal and
what kind of spells it has.&nbsp; Once you find your target, fight it anyway
you want.&nbsp; As the creature is about to die, reclaim your pet and finish
the creature yourself.&nbsp; As you share XP gained in battles with your
pet, not having it around when the battle ends will give you roughly twice
more XP than having it around.&nbsp; This strategy works even better against
creature that start running away once its HPs drops below a certain point.&nbsp;
As the name says, the main advantage of this strategy is simply getting
more XP.&nbsp; But it comes at the expense of your bone chips as you will
always have to get a new pet.</font>
<p><i><font color="#FFFF99">Petless</font></i>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">When hunting with large parties, it is sometimes
advisable to stay without a pet.&nbsp; There will be occasions when your
party is simply superior to your targets and you don't need the pet anyway.&nbsp;
But there will be situations when even your mighty party will find itself
in dangerous situations.&nbsp; If the later is true and you are hunting
undeads, stay without a pet and simply get yourself one during the battle.&nbsp;
Have your tank pull the undeads and as soon as he comes back, charm one
of the undeads with Dominate Undead.&nbsp; You will not only reduce your
opponents strength but also have a new ally to fight for your party.&nbsp;
The advantage here is that you balance a combat with a single cast and
have a cool new pet fighting for you.&nbsp; The main disadvantage is that
your newly acquired pet will turn against you at any minute.&nbsp; Remember
to be prepared and let your party know what you are doing.</font>
