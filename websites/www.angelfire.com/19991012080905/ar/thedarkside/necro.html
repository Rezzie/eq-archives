<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">Ok, so you want
start a necromancer character and is looking for a few tips.&nbsp; Well,
hopefully you can find answers to some questions you might have in this
guide.&nbsp; You can also check the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> section
for issues not mentioned here.&nbsp; Comments, suggestions and contributions
are greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Just click on the submit link in the main
menu.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">The first thing you
should do when starting a new character is answer the following question:
Do I want to be a PvP player or not?&nbsp; The reason I say this is some
classes are a better fit to PvP than others.&nbsp; In my humble opinion,
the necromancer is not a good class for that.&nbsp; Even though I believe
we are one of the most powerful in the game, we are slow in dealing damage.&nbsp;
I have seen countless duels between necromancers and other spellcasters
classes such as magicians and wizards where the necromancer would barely
inflict any damage to its opponent.&nbsp; Thus, I would not recommend a
necromancer PvP.&nbsp; But hey, what is life without a good challenge?&nbsp;
Maybe you can become a mighty necromancer and prove me wrong.&nbsp; If
you do so, please let me know so I can tell everyone how dumb I was to
think like this.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">In any way, if you
are not planning to have your name in red, the necromancer is an excellent
class.&nbsp; One of the best in the game, you will be able to solo a number
of creatures that other classes have difficulty dealing with by themselves.&nbsp;
Our ability to have a pet, deal DoT damage, and deal like no other class
with undead creatures also make us necromancers a party member anyone should
want in their team.&nbsp; Necromancers are also the only class in the game
where you can fight a creature of your level and walk out of battle with
full health.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">So, without any further
delay, lets get into some of the specifics in order to create a necromancer
character.&nbsp; Walk in darkness my friend.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">Which one should
you choose?&nbsp; No one but yourself can answer that question.&nbsp; It
is a matter of personal preference and the difficulty level you are looking
for.&nbsp; Humans are the base class in Norrath and should make a little
bit easier to play a necromancer.&nbsp; On the other hand, Dark Elves are
the evil class of Norrath and a Dark Elf necromancer will be most definetely
hated throughout Norrath.&nbsp; Besides that, each class has its own peculiarity.&nbsp;
Dark Elves are very agile and intelligent; Erudites are very intelligent
and have a better charisma then all other classes but humans; Gnomes are
also very agile and intelligent, as well as pretty dexterous; finally,
Humans, are the base class and even though are not bad in anything, are
also not good in anything.&nbsp; Thus, choose wisely and take into account
not only the advantages each class possess, but also its disadvantages.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">The next step in
a character formation&nbsp; is to distribute those 30 bonus points you
receive.&nbsp; Once again, this will be dictated by your own preferences.&nbsp;
I can give only give you one advice.&nbsp; What will be doing 15 levels
later? Will you be relying on other people to sell things for you?&nbsp;
Will you be a master jewelrer?&nbsp; Will you be a better than average
melee fighter?&nbsp; Or will you be a pure spellcaster that avoids melee
combat at all costs?&nbsp; These are some questions you should try and
answer in order to better split your bonus points.&nbsp; Even though you
should know this, below is a description of each attribute.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Strength:</font><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Raises your attack power and dictates how much damage you will inflict
when in melee combat</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Stamina:</font><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Raises your maximum Hit Points (HP)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Agility:</font><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Dictates how often you will get hit in battle</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Dexterity:</font><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Dictates how often you will hit your opponent when in melee combat</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Wisdom:</font><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Dictates how successful you are when using a trade skill such as jewelry
or spell research</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Intelligence:</font><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Raises your maximum mana points and dictates how fast you will learn new
skills or improve old ones</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFCC">Charisma:</font><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Dictates how will people treat you and how much they will pay for things
you want to sell or charge for things you want to buy</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">My recommendation
is to put some points in intellingence (the most important one as you want
as much mana as possible and learn new skills faster), stamina (a few to
raise your max HP), wisdom (if you are going to take on a trade skill),
and charisma (make yourself a little more friendly looking and get better
prices with merchants).&nbsp; But choose as you might and be aware that
these attributes will remain constant for the rest of your life (with the
exception of magical pieces that can modify them).</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">Ok, so there you
are, pretty much naked and all by yourself in a city you might not be familiar
with.&nbsp; What should you do?&nbsp; Well, the first thing you should
is memorize the two spells you have with you.&nbsp; Heheh, I guess you
knew that, so now what?&nbsp; Well, look out for the necromancers' guild
in your town.&nbsp; Remember, you are a necromancer so your guild should
be pretty much well hidden or even outside of town.&nbsp; Ask around and
you should be able to find it.&nbsp; It is there that you should hand over
your letter (read it first to see the name of the NPC you should give it
to) and receive your first XP and a robe.&nbsp; You are now ready for your
first battle.&nbsp; Well, not really.&nbsp; A necromancer is pretty much
defenseless without a pet so check out your guild and see how much the
spell Cavorting Bones costs.&nbsp; Of course you won't have money to buy
it but there is something you can do and that I always do if I see a young
necromancer around.&nbsp; Check who is in your zone at that time and see
if any higher level necromancer is around.&nbsp; If so, ask him if he could
be so kind as to buy you that Cavorting Bones spell.&nbsp; Who knows, you
might get lucky (afterall, 1G is nothing even for a level 8 necromancer).&nbsp;
If you get the spell, great.&nbsp; If not, then start saving those silver
coins until you get enough to purchase the spell.&nbsp; It should be the
first thing you spend your money at.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">So now you are ready
for your first battle.&nbsp; If you not only new to the necromancer class
but also to the game, you should learn the consider command.&nbsp; Always
consider a creature before attacking.&nbsp; Just target that creature and
hit C.&nbsp; The message it gives you will pretty much dictate the outcome
of the battle.&nbsp; You will soon learn what all con replies are.&nbsp;
At first, the easiest creature should read that it would be an even fight.&nbsp;
Those are the ones you are looking for.&nbsp; But before engaging in combat,
make sure you know your way around and how close you are to a safe spot.&nbsp;
Try fighting at first in places close to a zone or local guards.&nbsp;
Those are two good resources for times when things might get complicated.&nbsp;
Once you are familiarized, attack and hopefully get your first kill.&nbsp;
Start saving those loots and once you are full, head back to the necro
guild and sell it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">One important thing
about the first battles is realizing that you will die, specially if you
don't have a pet.&nbsp; There is something you can do to make the recovery
of your corpse easier if you do not own the locate corpse spell yet.&nbsp;
If you realize death is a possibility you might not be able to avoid, type
/location or /loc or /l before dying.&nbsp; It will give the coordinates
of your corpse in case you die and make it easier for you to get back to
it.&nbsp; But do not be too afraid of dying as it will happen.&nbsp; Often.&nbsp;
And remember you do not loose XP if you die until you reach level 5, so
just go there and fight.</font></font>

</table>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">I will be adding
more and more tips for newly created necromancers as I get contributions,
but here are some to start with:</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
You can move your corpse to a different and safer location by typing /corpse</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Partying with people will make you get less XP, but it will also make it
safer for you, so try partying every once in a while to take on tougher
creatures</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Do not party though with anyone 3 levels above or below yours.&nbsp; A
three level difference is the maximum that will provide you XP.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Get to know the place you are.&nbsp; Go to the zones nearby whenever you
can.&nbsp; Travel and adventure as much as you can.&nbsp; You will never
know if the place you currently are is good or not if you don't know any
other place you can compare it with.&nbsp; Ok, so that kobold cons green
but still gives you XP, but it is so little it is not worth the time and
effort you are putting into it.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Don't be afraid to ask questions.&nbsp; Most people are happy to pass on
the knowledge they acquired previously throughout their lives in Norrath.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Clouds in Norrath always move from west to east.&nbsp; So if you are lost
and that damn sense heading skill constantly says that you have no idea
which direction you are facing, try looking up the sky.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
But do use sense heading as often as you can.&nbsp; At least until it maxes
out (max goes up by 5 each new level) so when you reach a higher level
your skill will be in good shape</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Do not use practice points in skills you can learn during battles or in
the field.&nbsp; Save those points for skills that are either expensive
or difficult to learn.&nbsp; Initially, I would only spend practice points
in channeling since that will make your spells fizzle a lot less.&nbsp;
Do not spend more than 10 points though.&nbsp; Once you reach level 4,
spend some in meditate as it will speed up your mana recovery process.&nbsp;
All other skills will be learned in the field.&nbsp; Note, the first spell
that requires the evocation skill is Ward Undead at level 8, so you might
want to spend a few on this skill also in order to speed up the learning
process.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
You can do your own /loc databank.&nbsp; It can make your traveling a lot
easier.&nbsp; Whenever you are in a location you know you will come back,
type /loc and write down those coordinate.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
You can customize any command you want and put it into one of the 6 hot
buttons accessed by the numbers 1 through 6.&nbsp; To do that, go to the
socials menu and right click on a button, for example Hail.&nbsp; That
button is useless right now and you can change it for a more useful command.&nbsp;
Once you right click a button, the customization screen should appear.&nbsp;
Choose a name for that button and type the command you wish to store (e.g.
/pet attack).&nbsp; You now have your customized button.&nbsp; Just left
click and hold and put it in one of the hot button boxes to the left.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
The commands to control a pet are:&nbsp; /pet attack, /pet follow me, /pet
guard me, /pet guard here, /pet as you were, /pet sit down, and /pet stand
up</font></font>
<p><img SRC="spike.gif" height=23 width=23 align=TEXTTOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;
Get to know people throughout your adventures as chances are you will be
meeting them over and over again.&nbsp; As a necro, the more friends you
have the easier things get for you.&nbsp; You will find yourself in situations
where help might save your life or satiate your hunger.</font></font>

On a similar note, help people as much you as you can.&nbsp; Help young
necromancers as you were in that situation before and if you are like me,
you know how hard it can be.&nbsp; I have donated countless platinum pieces
to many people that I might never see again.&nbsp; But sometimes you do
see them and they will remember what you did for them in the past.</font></font>

Becoming a PvP is a one way road.&nbsp; There is no coming back.&nbsp;
If you want to do so, all you have to do is give the note you start with
to the local Prince of Discord.&nbsp; He will make you a PvP.&nbsp; Be
prepared for the consequences though as you might loose that 1 prized possession
(if you loose in a battle, the one that defeated you is entitled to loot
1 item from your corpse).</font></font>

Explore, adventure, meet people, try new things, and have fun. That is
the one tip you should really take into consideration.</font></font>
