<td><font color="#C0C0C0">Eruds Crossing is a small island located in the
middle of the ocean, in between the towns of Qeynos and Erudin.&nbsp; It
is home to the cat people.&nbsp; To reach this tiny island, take the boat
from either Qeynos or Erudin and wait till it docks in a small island where
one of the cat people will be standing just inside the docks.&nbsp; You
can make this a shorter trip if coming from Erudin as you can jump right
if facing the front of the boat as soon as it enters Eruds Crossing and
swim straight ahead.&nbsp; It should not take you more than a few minutes
to reach the island.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Characters in their young adolescence will benefit
the most from Eruds Crossing.&nbsp; You can start coming here at level
9 if in a party with a tank to take out Zombies that spawn under the sunken
skeleton ship just near the shore.&nbsp; Take this as an opportunity to
practice (if you haven't done before) your evocation skill by casting Ward
Undead.&nbsp; This is an extremely useful spell against undeads, dealing
41 damage in one single blow.&nbsp; For a character of level 9 or even
higher, this is substantial damage.&nbsp; Once you reach level 12, Willowisps
become a viable and very profitable option.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">A small variety of creatures dwell here and you
are very limited in choices.&nbsp; Eruds Crossing is actually only good
for adventurers looking to fight either Zombie Sailors or the sought after
Willowisps.&nbsp; Other creatures such as the Kerran Beetle, Kerran Spider
or Kerran Snake should be avoided at all costs.&nbsp; Killing either one
of these creatures will make the cat people in the island enfuriated and
they will attack you.&nbsp; In addition, spiders and snakes can poison
you with a reasonably strong poison and without a healing member by your
side, this will often mean certain death.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Two good tactics can be used here in Eruds Crossing.&nbsp;
As mentioned before, you can come with a party to fight zombies.&nbsp;
At lower levels, a party of 4 with a tank should be able to deal with them
just fine.&nbsp; They will provide very good experience and often good
loot, most commonly raw-hide armors.&nbsp; To fight them, set camp in front
of the sunken ship (you can see the top part of it) and send your tank
swimming to pull the Zombies.&nbsp; Three spawn at a time and if they will
come in full force.&nbsp; Do not try to pull them yourself as they will
most certainly attack you before you have a chance to reach dry land.&nbsp;
That by itself is not a problem, but once you are hit, your pet will come
to your rescue making this an underwater battle.&nbsp; And believe me,
it makes things a lot harder as you must be under water to both cast spells
and command your pet.&nbsp; Thus, send a petless companion to do the pulling
and Ward Undead those zombies to death.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">The other good strategy can be used once you reach
level 12.&nbsp; By this time, your pet will have magical attack abilities
and you can start fighting Willowisps.&nbsp; Five wisps spawn at Eruds
and the best thing is they all spawn in the same spot.&nbsp; If you are
facing backwards from the sunken ship, head right and up.&nbsp; You will
be a few steps away from a partially covered monument stone that is the
wisps spawning place.&nbsp; Just sit on top of the hill and wait for them
to spawn.&nbsp; The only problem is that this is a very sought after spot
and you might have to share with fellow players the 5 wisps that spawn
here.&nbsp; In any case, fighting wisps will give you good experience and
probably the best loot for a low level creature.&nbsp; You will often get
lightstones and occasional greater lightstones.&nbsp; You should be able
to solo 2 wisps at the same time, but be careful if more than that start
attacking you.&nbsp; Thus, sharing the spot with someone else can actually
be a good idea as long as it is just the two of you.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Overall, Eruds Crossing is a great hunting ground.&nbsp;
It would be one of the best for low level characters if it wasn't so god
damn full most of the times.&nbsp; If you find the island empty, you will
be able to fill that XP bar quite fast and your bank account in the process.&nbsp;
If not, 3 Zombies and 5 Willowisps are only good enough for two groups.&nbsp;
A third one won't have much to do here.</font></td>

<p><b><font color="#FFFF99">Things you should know:</font></b><font color="#C0C0C0">Two
kinds of madman spawn at times in Eruds Crossing, the Island Madman and
the Erudite Madman.&nbsp; The Island Madman is a level 12 spellcaster that
is not very hard to kill, but the Erudite is a level 17 spellcaster that
can be quite tough to kill.&nbsp; So be careful if you see one around as
they will most likely attack you on sight.&nbsp; Also, as mentioned before,
do not attack beetles, spider or snakes since they are considered sacred
by the cat people and will attack you if they spot you fighting these creatures.&nbsp;
In addition, killing these creatures will make Fire Elementals spawn and
they can be all the way up to level 16 heavy hitting critters that will
attack you on sight.</font>
