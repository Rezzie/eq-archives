<h1 class="article_title">Visions and Omens</h1>
<p>by Loral on August 25, 2004</p>

<p>The Omens beta began in full last week.  Larger guilds began testing out raid encounters while the rest of us ran Guktan wizards to the corners of the world marveling at the strange sights.</p>

<p>Most of Omens of War reminds me of Kunark.  The architecture and the plight of the Dragorn empire squeezed within the Muramite's iron gauntlet creates a lot of similarities to the Iksar and their post-Shissar empires.  Massive castles and spired walls stretch across the green landscape.  Orange and red clouds flow over hills and ravines.</p>

<p>A first glance shows us nine open over-land zones and three sets of instanced expeditions: the caves, the sewers, and the catacombs, each with about four or five variants.  More zones await discovery.  The first overland zone and the first set of instanced expeditions supports level 45+ with beasts lower in power than those in Natimbi.  The beasts grow in power quickly beyond that point.</p>

<p>There looks to be some excellent hunting zones between 60 and 70, although I imagine SOE developers continue to tune experience modifiers.  Between Planes of Power, Gates of Discord, Lost Dungeons, and Omens of War zones, there appears to be no lack of hunting areas for any level up to 70.</p>

<p>I have seen no equipment or loot so I cannot know yet if the power-gap between single-group hunters and raiders will close in at all.  Hopefully Omens offers enough single-group equipment to get players through the single-group trials of Gates.  Too long have the mountain trials, Kodtaz, and the Ikkinz trials been closed to non-raiders.</p>

<p>Lists of new Omens of War alternate advance abilities popped up everywhere on Friday.  While the lists contain no associated costs for these skills, many of them are surprisingly good.  A lot of changes that we never expected to see began to show up.  New spell-gem slots, new buff slots, a gate for everyone, two binding areas for wizards, and a surprisingly large increased mana regeneration cap for pure casters.  I can only really speak for clerical abilities but the list looks good, with a lot of basic improvements to our core function including improved healing gift, healing adapt, celestial rejuvenation, and our first critical heal over time ability.  I purchased few AAs for Gates, but now I am glad I saved up the points for Omens abilities.</p>

<p>One nice thing about new Alternate Advance skills is that any player can acquire them regardless of where they hunt.  They don't get stuck on your body when you wipe out in Fear and they don't require camping obscure mobs in obscure places for a 1 in 6 chance at that one last spell you needed.</p>

<p>Spells in Omens are distributed with runes, one rune per level, similar to Gates of Discord.  SOE developers compared it to Planes of Power.  Spells will not be duplicated.  What isn't known is the difficulty in acquiring spells.</p>

<p>Task system testing also began late last week.  While continued testing and balancing needs to occur before release, the skeleton of the system shows promise.  Single players are able to complete tasks in under an hour and earn a noticeable reward for doing so.  The reward is nice enough to make a difference but small enough to keep players from ignoring requests for groups.  Single groups should always be the core Everquest hunting team.</p>

<p>The task system is the one feature of Omens that supports players from level 20 to (hopefully) 70.  SOE brings up the task system whenever the requests for solo instanced encounters arise.  I don't believe any system can match up to the expectations people have for it.  It will take a few such systems to cover all of the needs and desires for short-duration content.</p>

<p>The official website of Omens of War includes a couple of new features I hadn't yet heard about.  One of them, a voice macro of some sort, shows a lot of promise.  Now an interesting show on Tivo won't kill half a group in eight seconds.  Now raid leaders can wake up that 20% of their raid who always seems to be asleep.  None of this is yet in the beta so I cannot say exactly how it works.</p>

<p>This week, the Omens of War developers and SOE community represenatives had an moderated chat with players.  EQ Stratics posted <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/hoclogs/oowhoc.php">a log of the transcript</a>.  Few details are given, but topics such as spells, new epic quests, content for players under 50, and solo instances all came up.</p>

<p>Omens of War brings us over a dozen new zones, half of them instanced.  It expands the physical worlds of Norrath even further.  I wonder if SOE might best spend their time working on new expansions that take Everquest into directions other than new zones to explore.  Everquest is certainly wide, it is the largest physical game I've ever played, but it isn't very deep.  The vast majority of content builds around combat against bosses.  The numbers increase but the gameplay is generally the same.  New lines of progression need to be developed.</p>

<p>I could sit here and come up with ideas stolen from other role playing games, but I am sure SOE's developers can do the same so I will leave it into their capable hands.  I heard some exciting ideas thrown around at the guild summit and I only hope they attempt to run with some of them.  Omens is a strong expansion and its release opens up the future into entirely new possibilities.  Now is the time to consider and develop those new possibilities.  The world is yours.</p>

<p>As the Beta is just starting, anything can change. But so far things sound good. I will still wait quite a while before getting OoW (if ever, go go EQ2 Beta start) to see what more people think about it. I won't pre-order again before seeing plenty of player feedback thanks to GoD.</p>

<p>Sounds like more of the same. I agree that maybe it's time to stop making EQ bigger. It's time to make EQ better and bigger does not equal better the way recent expansions have gone. It sounds like a weak expansion to me. I don't see how this is going to be similiar to Kunark from what was described except for raising the level cap whoopee. Kunark was a HUGE and extremely important expansion that really catapulted EQ to the success it became. This one just sounds like adding a few zones and gimmicks, including some stuff that should be added for free like the extra spell slot.</p>

<p>The real question is whether the spells will be No Drop like they are in GoD, which pretty much locks them up out of reach of all but the top end raiding Guilds, or those gimped in by friends in said Guilds...  At least make it so we can purchase the spells from other players ala PoP!<br />

<p>It seems with GoD and LDoN there is nothing of any value to purchase things. Everything worth anything has to be obtained via progression.</p>

<p>I really hope there is more avenues for obtaining gear and spells. </p>

<p>I always tought: if you cant earn them, you cant have them.</p>

<p>But of course, they must be great spells BUT not required for content that is lower level than what you need to aquire them *as it has happened before*.</p>

<p>The task system sounds interesting, the fact that he mentions they lead into instanced missions is even better. </p>

<p>Now, i hope there do are group designed tasks, and that these can be obtained from diferent static NPCs on every city.</p>

<p>Honestly, if used properly, the task system may be the best feature of EQ ever, but so far it still seems as a bone for the solo dog.</p>

<p>The current beta Omens task system doesn't have instanced dungeons or encounters.  It is also designed for soloers to accomplish in about an hour.  If I had a group I would rather do an LDON.  The task system should never be so good that people don't want to group.  Grouping should always come first.</p>

<p>How about some comments on the way they are making top end GoD item caster focus not scale up to 70. If they did this to melee focus and procs like anger or haste items the player base would be up in arms, but even though they diluted the power of focuses by splitting them down so you need seperate focuses for group heals and single targetted ones, every different detrimental spell type needs it's own focus, and other silly crap, now they are going to all need to be replaced at 70 or work half as well. How would melee feel if their 40% haste item scaled down to 20% when they hit 70? That's essentially what they are doing to casters. It's all not rosy in this expansion's design, and as usual it's the itemization that looks like it will be a mess. Meanwhile in GoD, dispite their claims of improved spell drops, we have ranger swords rotting while half our guild hasn't got all their spells. I sure am glad their listening, just hard to tell who they are listening to.</p>

<p>I'm always happy to get information about the game that is not polluted by the sadly usual whining and complaining. I think the articles here are actually more objective than many. Loral talks about things which he thinks are positive, as well as about things he is concerned about. Its perfectly okay to say that something is good, by the way. Objectivity goes both ways - its not the act of finding all attributes of a subject one could possibly disagree to.</p>

<p>Now lets not get entangled in an objectivity discourse - of course, anything one says or writes is colored by one's own views and opinions. But I dare say trying to see the good and the bad is a lot more objective than just looking for things to complain about.</p>

<p>That said I think that if not every character got all spells and foci then that is not a design flaw. If there are more foci than can be equipped at one time, the result will be that different people will have different foci, giving them bonuses on different kinds of spells. Of course, some foci will be mainstream and some not, but essentially there will be more diversity among foci-using characters, which is, in my opinion, a good thing. The same applies to spells (and items). Its cool if one or two chars in your guild can cast a rare AE spell, while another has that special over-time heal, for example. If you want to farm rare drops, you know what to expect and shouldn't whine because its your own decision to do it. And no, its not SOE's obligation to make sure everyone gets all spells (or armor pieces, or mobs, or whatever).</p>

<p>Flame away ;-)</p>

<p>Objectivity does not mean only talking about  positives and refusing to address negatives in any meaningful way. Mobhunter has always been like this, in fact the previous person running MH now works for SOE on EQ2. Yeah real it's real objective here. At least I can read between the lines and see advertising for what it is. This article was basically an advertisment for OOW.</p>

<p>
<p>> How would melee feel if their 40% haste item scaled down to 20% when they hit 70?</p>

<p>Or their anger procs went from 700 hate down to 350?  Or better yet, how about if their melee weapons scaled down from 24/20 damage/delay to 12/20?  Or better yet, scaled down to 24/40?  Everyone STILL wants to upgrade their gear, it's just that caster's gear IS DOWNGRADED the higher level we get, instead of staying the same.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Silk on August 31, 2004 03:08 PM</strong></p>
<p>
<p>No, caster spells are not downgraded. A level 65 nuke will still do the same as it did before with the same focus item. A level 70 spell will do more than your level 65 spell and will be enhanced a little with your level 65 focus.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Felisse on August 31, 2004 05:18 PM</strong></p>
<p>
<p>Unalloyed positive?  Did you read the same post I did?</p>

<p>Loral pointed out several misgivings he had about the expansion.  He isn't sure the task system will go up to level 70.  He is pretty sure it won't address everything that is desired for soloers.  </p>

<p>He also thinks they could do with stop adding so many zones and start adding more other stuff.</p>

<p>He isn't sure if the progression for single groups will be adequate, and is clearly worried it won't be.</p>

<p>The only really positive thing he said was that the AA's looked good.  But since there's no xp cost listing yet, not even sure if good-for-the-price.</p>

<p>The game is beyond broke and has been for years. The only thing they can do is keep the bandages on and keep the bloodloss down.</p>

<p>Screwing over focii for the sake of level 70 will just piss more people off and surely leave OOW as the bitter aftertaste of the vomit that is known as Gate of Discord.<br />

<p>No, Silk - that is not correct. In fact, the level 70 spells aren't as effective as focused level 65 spells are, unless you get the level 70 focus as well. Believe me, the caster's wouldn't be as upset as they are were you correct. </p>

<p>As far as the task system goes - well, it "doesn't have" instanced dungeons, in fact it "doesn't have" very much at all. I'm not breaking the NDA by saying that it's a big, big disapointment, but I would be if I told you why. Let's just say that "working as intended" is probably correct, but "working in a reasonable way".....well, not yet.</p>

>here.</p>

<p>I can smell your envy. In case you did not used to read Mobhunter back then, Morgard was well known for throwing his mud balls at SOE VERY often.</p>

<p><br />
As for the task system, this is how I THINK it should be:</p>

<p>You get a task to take care of some complot somwhere far away. The plots can be anything from summoning a demon to stealing some artifact from some temple to just plain bandits somewhere.</p>

<p>You will be forced to travel there trough old means, meaning boats and walking. </p>

<p>ALL the way there you will be constantly ambushed by both, enemies related to your target as well as zone defined ambushers. Example of zone defined ambushes can be orcs on the commonlands or a pack of lions on the Karanas. Maybe one huge giant... This would all be things that will sneak on you and you will have to fight, no sneaking around will work as they will spawn already with your group on top of the agro list.</p>

<p>So, once you get to the point you where sent to there you will find the enemy you where sent to take care off, but he will only spawn once you get there, he wont spawn before so someone can take care of him first.</p>

<p>Currently the world is huge, so i KNOW that you can do the system inteligent enough to make sure your destination wont be where other adventurers are hunting. Of course the system should take into account what expancions are owned by each member just to make sure it wont send them into a land they cant visit.</p>

<p>The xp reward should be avarage, being compensated by the final reward. This should be both for solo and for groups.</p>

<p>As a fellow Cleric I find myself looking forward to spending some time in OOW.  In memory of past events however I will not be purchasing the package as a preorder.  I am one who likes to keep a box around and reinstall things just often enough that I like the cd.</p>

<p>One really damning flaw of GoD in my opinion is the horrible drop rates on the spells.  I have been in a lot of GoD groups now, killed quite a few named and in all the time I have been there I have only seen one Spell rune drop.  Even that one drop turned out to be for a bard though and it had to rot.</p>

<p>Sadly the GoD spells for Clerics are nice enough that they are fairly desirable but what good does it do to have spells that again are only available to the raid guilds?  Im getting damn tired of second class status.</p>

<p>Have to totally agree, you will love the quests if you like screwing up faction and having a time limit. Just what a casual "I can only log in for a short time" player wants to do. Oh well goes along with the cookie cutter zones and that horrid mess of illogically laid out streets they call the Proving Grounds.</p>

<p>The stairstepping in the game's equipment has been done by a series  of expansions we as players have had to purchase to continue playing.  For Omens of War I am cancelling two of my accounts due to the continued insult.  The additional content is and should be covered under the monthly fee without extortion.  Why not cancel all 5?  Because my wife is having a blast so I'm keeping a pair of my acct. as well as hers.</p>

<p>The manner in which it is not possible to gain access to zones  and materiel without, for most of us, guildhopping  and making friends feel like we are abandoning them is another big issue. This can be addressed by single group equippage being upgraded thru instanced dungeons, of course.</p>

<p>As for the foci issue, dont people remember the spell focus items stopping all together?  Haste Enhancement I, works on spells up to level 20...Then you had to get a new one!  SOE was actually being nice to have them work to some extent all the way to 70 imo.</p>
