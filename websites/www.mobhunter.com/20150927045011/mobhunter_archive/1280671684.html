Here are the details for those keeping score at home:<p>** General:<p>- Merchants: You can now view 80 items worth of inventory from both PC Traders and NPC Merchants.<p>** Internal:<p>- Rewrote the &quot;Do I Own This Expansion?&quot; validation that happens when a person changes zones. Prevented people from entering old world zones. One world patch later, it appears to be working properly. Sorry about that.<p>- Items can now have both a traditional Effect and Focus Effect. Please check out the new and improved 8th Shawl for an example.<p>** Interface:<p>- New /note window. The window should allow people to take notes in game if they like, but the old /note <text> command still works as it always has. Use /note without additional text to see. The /note command window has been intentionally designed to *not* break existing skins.<p>- The Tab/Shift-Tab &quot;/reply&quot; queue now takes into account the people who may be talking to you across servers, and knows to use a &quot;;reply&quot; command to talk back to them.<p>** Magic System:<p>- DoT Stacking: Many player-cast Damage over Time spells now allow multiple versions of themselves to land on a single NPC. This only works for spells that are already on a creature, and does not allow for inferior spells to stack along with superior spells. (Example: Two Necromancers can both land Boil Blood on the same target. However, Heat Blood, being an inferior, will still not stack.) Please note, there is at least one bug preventing some spells from stacking that we've already fixed and will be shipped fixed next test patch.<p>- NPCs can now hold a total of 30 effects (buffs and debuffs) before effects begin to stop taking hold.<p>- Your-Pet-Only targeted buffs now automatically attempt to target your pet if you cast them with the wrong target, or no target at all.<p>- Foci/AA Criticals: Last patch, foci began adding their damage to post-AA damage. They now stack linearly again. (Meaning, the AA improves the base damage, then the Focus improves the base damage as well. The focus damage was never supposed to compound with the added AA damage.)<p>- Focus items: Many internal enhancements to the focus system. From the gameplay point of view, everything should still be working as it was.<p>- Avatar from Primal weapons isn't stacking properly on test at the moment. It's fixed internally and will go to test next update.<p>- The EverQuest Development Team</B><p>Vendors will be happy to have up to 80 things for sale, I guess--but does anybody really need to sell 80 things at once? It's not like there's a shortage of crap in the Bazaar.<p>The ability to have both focus and traditional effects on items will mean that casters are due for some truly uber gear. A longstanding complaint from casters of all types is that they don't benefit from equipment as much as melee types, but I'd say the days of that issue appear numbered. The updated 8th Coldain shawl (with Zephyr of Brell in addition to FT3) is just the first example.<p>The patch message also gives the first concrete explanation of the new DoT system. Changing NPCs to have 30 effect slots is pretty major, and will no doubt cause players to ask for more buff slots. Inferior DoTs being overwritten by superior ones makes sense, too, though it does cut into the effectiveness of lower-level casters, I guess.<p>Once again, we have to stress that this stuff is happening on Test server only, and <B>may or may not ever go live.</B> So don't get too upset yet--it's not like it's the end of the world.<p><BIG>It's the End of the World!!!</BIG><p>Currently on Test, druids and shamans have new healing spells that amount to a 25% to 75% version of complete heal, depending on how buff the recipient is.<p>The <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=2179&amp;source=Test">druid spell</a> is level 54, and heals 75% of the target's hitpoints--up to a maximum of 2925--with a ten-second casting time and a cost of 400 mana. The <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=2435&amp;source=Test">shaman spell</a> is the same in terms of level, casting time, and mana cost, but despite also being a labeled a 75% heal it currently has a cap of 1950 hitpoints.<p>Reactions from <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm30.showMessage?topicID=100.topic">druids</a> and <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=93a927bc503857badf815a6c7a0414b7&amp;threadid=4587">shamans</a> is mixed. Some love the new spells, while others claim the healing cap isn't high enough. The majority would most likely be content, though.<p>Clerics, for their part, are <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=15f822e520fde6c373b1a3a82ccf5e51&amp;threadid=11079">surprisingly calm</a>. Many of them hope these changes do go live because it would just about require Verant to add some more versatility to the cleric class.<p>It would... right?<p>There's no question that 2-3K mini-complete heals (maybe more, if focus effects count) would make druids and shamans more desired on raids--a major concern for druids, at least. But what effect would this have on the game for clerics if they remained unchanged?<p>Well, there would be almost no reason to want to do an exp group with a cleric. Pretty much anyplace that is efficient for getting experience--even a challenging place like the new Cazic-Thule--would be better served by a healer that can also evac, nuke, snare, DoT, or slow than one that simply heals and buffs. And much as I hate to bring up this topic again, such a paradigm shift in exp groups might very well make warriors less desired, too. You'd be better off having druids and shamans healing well-equipped monks, rogues, and hybrids than a warrior with a ton of hitpoints but lower damage output.<p>What would the effect of these changes be upon raids? The cornerstone of having clerics healing the main tank would still be safe and sound--the game has come too far to ever change that. But letting druids and shamans fill in the gaps in the CH cycle would be beneficial, as would having them act as healers for rampage tanks (sorry, Tililae). Of course, doing this might gimpify ubermobs even more than they already are, making it easier for less-tactical guilds to zerg boss mobs. Every increase in player power equals a decrease in mob power, after all.<p>Okay, this is a lot to chew on. Let us recap.<p>- Increasing druid and shaman healing power is good for those classes, making them wanted and needed on raids and in exp groups. It is appropriate for druids to receive more healing power of the two, as shamans are already highly desired as it is.<p>- Clerics need a more compelling reason to play. Yes, complete heal is vastly overpowered and needs to be balanced by shortcomings elsewhere, and the ability to resurrect dead players has no equal in the game. Even so, clerics need something else to be desired for experience groups, or else the cleric class is on the path to extinction.<p>- No doubt about it, this is MUDflation in action. If these changes go live, you can bet your sweet behind that Planes of Power will be tuned to take this into account, while mobs in the existing game will become slightly easier. Is the tradeoff worth it to make some classes feel more wanted and needed? Probably. When the Emperor in Ssra falls to a guild with only five clerics in its CH rotation, we'll let you know. /wink<p><BIG>All That AND a Bag of Chips</BIG><p>A reader named Onetree Tallbarque of the Karana server pointed out that there have been nearly 300 spell changes made on Test server recently--far too many for us to detail. You can check with your new best friend, Lucy, to see what has happened on the last <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2002-08-21%2005:05:17">day</a> or <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2002-08-20%2000:55:03">two</a>. Highlights include:<p>- Changes to <a href="http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheplaneofmischieffrm12.showMessage?topicID=371.topic">Plane of Mischief boxes</a><p>- Druid epic effect had the <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=1926&amp;source=Test">snare component removed</a><p>- Bards got a new <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1100&amp;source=Test">mez song</a> that they <a href="http://pub105.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=14765.topic">seem to like</a><p>- Many of the lure spells that we reported as changed to unresistable yesterday have reverted back to their former state of resistability<p>Scott Hartsman had a <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=19750.topic&amp;start=58&amp;stop=58">comment</a> on Graffe's board that sheds some light on why spell resistances are being tinkered with:<p><B>Before anyone starts thinking that we're changing what spells will do, I'd recommend making sure to check with someone who's used them on test.<p>We're doing some reworking of the resist system, and we're translating some existing spells to fit how the system now works.</B><p>That statement is a bit vague, but it certainly hints at some big stuff to come.<p>Once again, let's be absolutely clear: <B>Everything discussed above is on Test server only, and may or may not ever go live.</B> While all of it is certainly worth discussing, none of it is worth having a coronary episode over.<p>That applies to video games in general, by the way. Even EverQuest.
