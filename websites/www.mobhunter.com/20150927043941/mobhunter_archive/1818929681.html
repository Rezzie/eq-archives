They put together an extensive April Fool's joke that made it appear Yantis (you know him, you love him) bought control of the community. Their hoax includes cash-themed graphics, hilarious <a href="http://pub130.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm51">surveys</a>, and an end to <a href="http://pub130.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm49.showMessage?topicID=1.topic">free trading</a>. Right click on hyperlinks for an extra bit of fun.<p>It's not often somebody goes to this much effort for a silly non-official holiday, so a big thumbs up to the people who pulled it off. Banning the naysayers was an especially nice touch.<p><BIG>Homemade News</BIG><p>In case you missed it yesterday, Absor <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=155233032&amp;msgid=-1009470803#message">posted</a> right here at Mobhunter that while monk mitigation will indeed be improving, the 50% number quoted on the monk boards is not accurate. There was no offical statement made at FanFaire as to what the number will be, only that mitigation will be better. <p>Alan also <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=155233032&amp;msgid=820420919#message">responded</a> to one of our reader's concerns that Comatose, a necro/SK spell introduced in the Ykesha expansion, isn't available because one of the quest components doesn't appear to drop:<p><B>That came up at Fan Faire. We recently bumped up the drops for the quest (doubled them, in fact). We asked that the guy who brought it up send us an email if that wasn't the issue. If it's something other than drops (like something broken with the quest) drop me an email with details and we'll fix it.</B><p>I must say, it's nice when Absor posts news in Mobhunter's message threads. It saves me a lot of time scanning dozens of message boards looking for the latest SOE posts. Now if I can just convince Rich Waters to write news roundups for me, I'll really be in business.<p><BIG>GUing, GUing, Gone?</BIG><p>No, Woody Hearn's <a href="http://www.gucomics.com/">GUComics</a> isn't going anywhere. However, it does appear he's changing his subject matter from EverQuest to the upcoming <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a> game. Woody <a href="http://deepfriedforums.com/showthread.php?s=d2aa13f6e84057289984153b8b1e9260&amp;threadid=43508&amp;perpage=25&amp;pagenumber=2">insists</a> this is <I>not</I> an April Fool's joke, and it sure doesn't sound like one.<p>While we'll certainly miss Woody's EQ material, it's not like we won't still have his talents on hand. We'll keep on enjoying his cartoons, although if we don't play the game we might not get all the jokes. Best of luck to Woody, no matter what he decides to do.<p><BIG>Tones on Tale</BIG><p>Just in case you needed another way to prove you're a complete dork, the Sony Station store has announced you can buy <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/ringtones/">EverQuest ringtones</a> for your cell phone. Get a load of this:<p><B>Now, you can carry the sounds of EverQuest with you! These unique EverQuest Ringtones for your cell phone will set you apart as a person who cherishes this special brand of entertainment and who is brave enough to stare a dragon in the eyes.</B><p>Ummm... right.<p>I don't know how <I>anybody</I> gets away with charging money for freaking ringtones. That's something literally beyond my comprehension. But there's three to choose from at two bucks a throw, so you can decide for yourself whether your love of EQ is deep enough to justify the price.<p><I><B>BAAAAAAH, DAH-DAH-DAH-DAAAAAAAH</B></I><br>&quot;Hello?&quot;<br>&quot;Hi, honey, it's Mom. STOP BUYING FREAKING RINGTONES AND MOVE THE HELL OUT OF MY BASEMENT!&quot; <click><p>See, this is why I don't own a cell phone.
