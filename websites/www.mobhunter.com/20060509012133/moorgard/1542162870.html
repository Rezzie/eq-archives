Too damn bad:<p><B>Due to a need for more thorough testing, the EverQuest patch scheduled for August 28th at 3AM PDT has been postponed for a week and has been tentatively rescheduled for September 4th at 3AM PDT.</B><p>While the uberguilds whine about their Vex Thal loot not being upgraded, most people want a patch to see some of the new spell changes go live. Of course, the people who gripe when a patch is delayed are the same ones who complain when bugs are introduced by a patch that gets rushed.<p>Obvious statement of the day: People like having something to bitch about. Thank goodness Verant is so accommodating!<p><BIG>Test Server Update #75962</BIG><p>As the Great Caster Balancing of '02 rolls on, Test server has become a hotbed of activity. Spells continue to be added and modified on a daily basis, causing the Mobhunter staff to flash our palms, warble our heads, and sassily exclaim &quot;Oh no you di'ent!&quot; to the dev team.<p>Sorry, guess I'm watching too much Ricky Lake these days.<p>Some of the more <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4504">interesting changes</a> lately have come in the form of an expanded role for shadowknights in the realm of aggro management. While SKs have always had spells to increase their own spot on the aggro list, for the first time they will be able to increase the hate generated by other players. Shadowknights are also <a href="http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=095f0c3e97510b49052b36e3281e19ba&amp;threadid=4989">jumping for joy</a> at receiving Harmshield, an invulerability spell along the lines of Divine Aura. These additional abilities will certainly expand the role of SKs on raids.<p>Another noteworthy change is that the cleric's new Ethereal Elixir spell has been changed from a group cast to an AoE. This means that anyone in a 75-foot radius of the cleric will get healed for 300 hitpoints per tick for four ticks--now that's some efficient healing, especially against mobs with nasty AoE/DoT spells.<p>Go ahead and browse the <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2002-08-27%2018:39:55">multitude of other changes</a> on Test. Talking about spells is giving me a headache.<p>Other notable twiddling on Test sever deals with the experience system:<p><B>Post-50 &quot;hell&quot; effect levels are gone. There are no longer any levels in EverQuest that are anywhere near twice as hard as their previous levels. Please note: This does not change the amount of experience required to go from &quot;No experience in level 1&quot; to &quot;Full-bar in level 60.&quot; It's just about smoothing out the trip.</B><p>Wow, that's a pretty major change, though it does match up with the removal of pre-50 hell levels from a while back. I'm still not convinced that such changes are really fair, though. It seems (to my math-hindered English-major brain) that there is some magic level at which you would be able to skip out on some required exp and get credit for stuff you didn't do. For instance, someone just about to ding out of level 58 would be in for a less horrible level 59, so should in theory get to 60 faster than someone who accomplished the same thing before this change goes into effect. Or something.<p>I guess I really don't care, so long as getting exp in level 60 isn't made harder. I asked Scott Hartsman whether this change would mean that levels 61-70 will also be on a flat progression, but he didn't fall for my little trap. Curse you, Hartsman!<p>There was also this tidbit in the Test patch message:<p><B>Post-50 characters will now gain more experience from hunting NPCs closer to their own level than ever before. (Meaning: Higher level blues, whites, yellows, and reds will pay off considerably better than they have in the past.) <p>This is a test of a potential new system. Briefly, the idea isn't really that much of a stretch: The larger the risk you take, the larger the reward should be. <p>The additional time that it takes to gain experience from high blues, for example, should now be rewarded more appropriately. Groups who test their limits by fighting NPCs that are hard to them should reap the greatest reward.</B><p>This is an awesome change that has been too long in coming. Players should get considerably more experience hunting in Cazic-Thule than they do in Fungus Grove or Velks Lab, as the amount of risk in the former dwarfs that in the latter two by a considerable margin.<p>Finally, the promised revamp of the sound engine is underway:<p><B>We've started work on the sound and music engine. If you used to have sound/music bugs, the first upgrade today might help a bit. This is the first step down a long road. If your particular sound/music issue isn't fixed, please be patient. There's no need to re-report existing sound/music bugs.</B><p>Could this eventually enhance EQ performance in general? We hope so. The current sound engine is a buggy dog, and improving it might squeeze a couple extra framerates per second out of your CPU. Our fingers are crossed.<p><BIG>I'll Take a Tall Stack, With Bacon</BIG><p>Over at the Ranger's Glade, Scott Hartsman recently stopped by to make some comments on <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8479">stacking issues</a> with various spells. Hartsman revealed that a new system is being put in place that should resolve a lot problems with certain spells overwriting each other:<p><B>Thanks to a new subsystem to help out with some of the more complex stacking problems (of which this one takes the cake), these are no longer overwriting WP. Spells can now mutually &quot;bounce&quot; off of each other. <p>The change will go to test fairly soon.<p>...<p>We don't like to intentionally make a spells with fewer HP overwrite spells with greater HP. No spell that has infinite potential for abuse can really be allowed, or it absolutely will be, as unfortunate as that is. It's rare, but it does happen. <p>The only alternative to that was a seven or eight way list of hardcoded spells, which isn't a valid answer, either. It just makes the stacking system even less maintainable. <p>That's why we waited until we could get a proper, flexible, cleaner system in place that we could use to solve this problem *and many others* all at the same time. <p>It's about fixing it the right way, once, as opposed to having this one get fixed with a hack, then the next one fixed with another hack, then the next.... and so on, where each progressive fix takes even longer as someone has to go through and figure out what all of the (growing) spaghetti means every time.</B><p>Trying to write clean code? What a silly programmer!<p>Many, many classes will be pleased if their spells don't overwrite each other. Having druids and clerics casting and recasting PotG and Aego is a silly business, and both those spells should definitely bounce off each other. Here's hoping the dev team catches most of those issues and gets them on the live servers soon.<p>I still don't get what Hartsman has against spaghetti, though.<p><BIG>The Sum of All Fears: 1 + 1 != 0</BIG><p>Yuck, more math! Actually, that was just Absor stopping by the Ranger board (what's with VI guys stalking rangers all of a sudden?) to talk about <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=13dbe8e5597aa82e61504ad6ab4f8bb5&amp;threadid=8303">balancing</a>, and how a change to one class doesn't mean that every class will get something:<p><B>If we add something to one class we immediately get called upon to 'even things up' by giving something to a bunch of other classes. The truth is, if we're adding an ability to one class it's usually because it needed a boost incomparison to other classes. 'Throwing a bone' to the other classes after such a change defeats the purpose of the change. <p>When it comes to this particular change, I think Rich explained it pretty well. The changes to Druid and Shaman healing are needed to remove a problem in the end game where some things just can't be done if there aren't enough clerics. It's a problem for gameplay when something like that exists. <p>But the fix itself creates a problem for Clerics, not in the raid situation - where the fix should have the desired effect of actually reducing the absolute need for clerics - but in other portions of the game. We certainly are not planning to make it so that clerics are unwanted in exp groups and similar situations. So we're adding a fix for that issue. <p>So, in this one case it turned out that giving something to Druids and Shamans also meant giving something to Clerics. But there is no zero sum.</B><p>Alan's discussion just underscores how tough this whole balance thing really is. Not only do all classes need functionality when raiding, grouping, and soloing, but the roles each has must be in proportion to those of other classes. The gut reaction when another person gets new toys is that we forget about our own--no matter how fancy--and covet those of our neighbor. And I seem to remember something about coveting being a bad thing.<p>I'm just waiting for monks to get healing spells or ports or something. It's no fun playing such a crippled class!<p><BIG>More Items, More Prices, More Popups</BIG><p>Another items/maps/prices site has gone live recently that you might enjoy checking out. EQItems.net collects lots of spoiler info and presents it to you with some decent search tools. However, I'm not posting a link to it--you can type the www.eqitems.net URL yourself.<p>Why no link? Because on my trip there I was inundated by popup ads. Not just your normal Casters Realm-type popups--I'm talking about the kind that spawn their own windows and take over your system when you try to close them. What's more, at least one of the windows was for a porn site. Mobhunter won't link to any site that has popups this nasty and is blatantly unsafe to view at work. For now, we continue to recommend you pay the money for Flashlink and use EQ Maps and EQ'Lizer for your spoiler info. Popups just aren't worth it, so stop being so damned cheap and pay up.<p><BIG>Sploiting on the Z</BIG><p>The officers of <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/">Legacy of Steel</a> were given a suspension of 7-10 days for allegedly using a Z-axis exploit to pull one of the Vex Thal sub-bosses. The guild is, um, a tad bit testy about it.<p>Never having been to VT myself, I can't comment on the specifics of this pull. Tork likens it to the Dain, which commonly involves forcing his royal ugliness to warp through the floor and onto your raid party. If this is the case in the VT pull, then Tork and co. have a point--if the Dain has been done this way forever, then why is the use of the same technique in Vex Thal an offense worthy of suspension?<p>As I don't possess all the facts here, I'm not going to comment on the specifics of the case. Tork makes some good points in his rant, but he also spouts some biased drivel that is pretty unfair to the current Verant staff. Dropping the f-bomb 168 times in an article does not make you right, and frankly Tork's style isn't quite as entertaining as Tigole's was--even when the latter went on similar rampages.<p>But regardless of what you think of uberguilds, one thing Tork says is undeniable: they do generate a lot of interest and free press for Verant. We all like to read what loot drops off the latest big bad ubermob, and seeing someone else do it gives hope to the thousands of players killing Sarnaks in Lake of Ill Omen that someday, some way, they will be able to do it, too.<p>By the way, if you'd like to sneak a peek at what some of those uberd00ds look like on <I>this</I> planet, Triton's site has some <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/">pictures</a> of Zaar, Furor, and Tigole getting together and stealing some guy's car.<p>Why do those uber guys all have dark hair? Why do they all look like they use too much gel? Why is Zaar so damn huggy? These are the kinds of questions that lamers like you and me will never know the answers to.
