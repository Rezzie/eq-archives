He explains:<p><B>By nature, most minerals have some point at which they can be melted. In order to determine what that point is, fusibility tests must be conducted. Being a master of the scientific art of wizardry, I, of course, have mastered this process. When exposing a mineral ore to a controlled amount of heat and other factors, it slowly shrinks, forming a liquid base of particles.</B><p>He's found several types of ore that fit this description.<p>Fusible Coral Ore - From Kedge Keep.<p>Fusible Earthen Ore - From the Hole.<p>Fusible Igneous Ore - From Skyfire Mountains.<p>Fusible Velium Ore - From Western Wastes.<p>By combining these metals together, he created a unique new wand. &quot;When held by a wizard of great power, not unlike myself of course, the magical energy of the scepter flows throughout the mind expanding the intelligence while providing a greater protection from the elements,&quot; Al'Kabor reports.<p>Sounds like something with high resists and maybe some kind of mana boost or flowing thought... but then again, I'm just a brainless melee type.<p>Finally, he had this to say about yet another type of metal:<p><b>Another remarkable discovery I made was while proceeding with my research of the Combine Empire upon the continent of Kunark. Hidden within a secret compartment amid the ruins I discovered yet another unique form of mineral ore. I have conducted many tests on this ore, including the fusibility tests, but so far I have not been able to determine its metallurgic properties. The fusibility tests that I have conducted so far failed to produce a melting point. In order to continue with the experiments on this ore, I must further my research on the Combine Empire in order to determine its origin.</B><p>In other words, there may be some new minerals found on some mobs after the patch. Those adventurous wizards among you may want to wipe out the populations of Kedge, Skyfire, the Hole, and Western Wastes, while hunting around for a container or passageway in the Combine outpost in Dreadlands.<p>If you're not into the roleplaying thing, well, at least you have an excuse to kill stuff.
