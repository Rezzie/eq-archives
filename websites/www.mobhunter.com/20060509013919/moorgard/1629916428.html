<html><head><title>Excuses, Excuses</title></head><body><h1>Excuses, Excuses</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-11-14</p>Nope, not much news to report. So instead, we've been having some <a href="http://www.wnew.com/opack/2000/Spider-Spaz_6-27-00/Photo24-Jackass.jpg">fun</a> around the Mobhunter offices, arguing about whether you'll be able to <a href="http://www.1americanatrail.com/images/JACKASS.JPG">equip</a> your horse in Luclin.<p>I guess a day off is okay, since we've all been <a href="http://www.deiman.nl/weird/images/jackass.jpg">overworked</a> anyway. With all the furor over finding that bin Lala guy and his evil <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/images/otherBINs.jpg">cohorts</a>, it's nice just to relax and <a href="http://www.newclear.net/~potus/kyjelly.jpg">unwind</a> for a change.<p>The news will be back tomorrow... we hope.
