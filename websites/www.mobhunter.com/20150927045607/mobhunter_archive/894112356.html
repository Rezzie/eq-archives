First, he discussed what necessitated the changes:<p><B>Until the changes, it was possible to use an AoE group to pull and kill an extreme number of NPCs (upwards of 50+) in an almost continuous fashion with a lower level of risk than was appropriate. There were, essentially, three factors that contributed to this, factors that don't exist all together in any other zone. The addition of the light blue experience-giving NPCs made more low-hit point NPCs available to give experience. The Grey had a rather fast spawn rate, increasing the pool of available experience giving NPCs over time. Also the NPCs in that zone were given very low resistances in order to make casters more appealing to groups in the zone.<p>Looked at individually, these three factors all seem like good things. During testing this zone worked as intended. But when exposed to AoE groups, these factors created a situation that made such groups far too efficient in this zone.</B><p>Next, he went into great detail about what was done to re-tune the zone:<p><B>Increased the hit points of all NPCs in the zone 8% (yes, that's 8 more hit points for every 100 it had before).<p>Reduced the spawn rates on the NPCs in the zone. There are still plenty of NPCs in the zone, but it might not be possible to pull and kill 30 or 40 at a time at a fast rate anymore.<p>Increased the resistance of the NPCs to moderate levels. Where they were practically unable to resist spells before, they now can resist spells some of the time. Cold and Fire spells might get complete or partial resists half the time, doing full damage the rest of the time. The initial changes to the zone had the average monsters being quite resistant to magic based spells, and after looking at the results the magic resistance has been lowered to a more appropriate level. This change should allow people to snare and root mobs more easily in The Grey.<p>Additionally, a resistant monster was added to The Grey. The new Shimmering Rockfiend is highly resistant to fire and cold based spells, and adds a bit more danger to pure AoE groups. This is tempered by the fact that the Rockfiend is fairly rare, easy to see, and the soloing casters in the zone will learn to recognize his threat and avoid fighting him. If you are pulling 40 monsters to your AoE group though, chances are you'll pick up a Shimmering Rockfiend or two and have to deal with them.<p>This in no way makes casters completely broken in The Grey. It doesn't remove the ability to effectively run an AoE group in this zone either. What it does is reduce the effectiveness of pulling massive numbers of NPCs and wiping them out with an AoE group. And the zone is still very workable for the balanced experience group, as well as soloing casters.</B><p>Sounds pretty reasonable to me. But before someone gets on my case, let's make something clear--see, I've actually <B>been</B> to the zone. What's more, I've actually <B>killed stuff</B> there. Even more shocking, I've actually <B>soloed</B> there--something I have no idea whether I can do anymore. So before some <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=9922.topic">rabid caster</a> goes on a rant about how your class is so screwed over by Verant and this is just another case of VI being out to get you, be aware that changes like this affect all kinds of classes, and we all have to learn how to deal with them.<p>Right now, legions of casters who have never even set foot in the zone are flooding Verant with more e-mail about how unfair all of this is. And you wonder why Abashi gets <a href="http://www.urban75.org/useless/reflex.html">cranky</a>...<p><BIG>Hi, My Name is a_n00b_001</BIG><p>Alan had to take time out of his busy day once again to address one of those stupid issues that makes you slap your forehead and want to shake someone. See, I'm convinced there is this clan of people called Patchwatchers. After every server downtime, these folks log in and check out every single item in their inventory, then try out all their class-specific skills, hoping they will find something has changed so that they can be the first to post about it.<p>What invariably ends up happening is someone fails feign death too many times, or doesn't see a fungus tunic drop after a few hours, or doesn't seem to be evading right, or has 18 fizzles in a row, and this person cries &quot;NERF! They nerfed XXXX in the last patch!&quot;<p>Sure enough, an itchy Patchwatcher sent Alan an e-mail complaining that some containers had been made no-drop in the last patch. Not all bags of a given type, mind you--just some of them. It's an evil Verant conspiracy, right? Right?<p><B>Those bags are no-drop only because they contain items that are no-drop. If you take the no-drop items out of the bags, you will see them return to droppable status.<p>Alan</B><p>Thanks, Patchwater. Please drive through.<p>NEXT!<p><BIG>Waitaminute, Maybe Patchwatcher Has a Point...</BIG><p>Erm, well, okay, maybe sometimes patchwatching is a good hobby after all.<p>The aforementioned fungus covered scale tunic is almost always the subject of post-patch conjecture. But this time there may actually be evidence that drop rates have indeed been nerfed on this favorite item of twinkers and monks (not to mention monk twinkers) everywhere.<p>See, a new tunic was recently found called the <a href="http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/new/equipment/lazy/funguspatchvest.shtml">fungus patch vest</a>, and guess what--it has the <I>exact</I> same stats as the fungus tunic. But unlike its predecessor, the fungus vest is usable by the Vah'Shir, is not usable by monks and druids, and most significantly, it is <B>no-drop.</B> In other words, you can still twink your kitty character, but getting that regen item is going to be a lot trickier.<p>Even if drop rates on the fungus tunic are lower now, I'm not sure it matters. On any remotely mature server the fungus tunic is so prevelant that it's a rare zone you don't see one being auctioned in. And with all the old-school players needing 100k for their new horsies, a lot of fungus tunics are being unloaded for a song.
