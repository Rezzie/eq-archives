Each new face corresponds to an old face, ones that they were based on. So when your old characters are given their new models, they are given a face that was designed from their old face.<p>This also means that when you change your new face, you also change your old one. If you really want the old face back you just have to change the new face back to the one that matches your old face. So if you think that there is a chance that you'll want to revert to the old models, take a screenshot of your new face when you first log in with that character and change back to that face if you decide to use the old models. <p>But remember, in the near future we will be turning off the ability to change your face at will, so make your decision as early as you can.<p>Alan</B><p>That's a damn confusing explanation, but after five or six reads I think I figured it out. I must challenge Absor's assertion that there is a new face that looks like my old one, however. I know when I first logged in with the new models, Moorgard's new face didn't look <I>anything</I> like his old, and I can't really find a suitable replacement. This may be partially due to the fact that hair choices on human males <B>suck big time,</B> however. I can choose from mullet, mullet, or Hell's Angel. I swore I saw some nice short hair on a human in one of those early screenshots. Where did that go?<p>Absor also fielded a player <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000415.html">question</a> about why we didn't see a new user interface with the arrival of Luclin:<p><B>Well, we decided to hold off on the new interface. It's going to be rolled out to all our customers, so it's not really a Luclin feature. Because we decided to make the new interface available to everyone, we had to make sure that it would work with all of the old commands. And since it wasn't a feature specifically for Luclin, we decided not to spend too much Luclin production time on its creation.<p>We also wanted to take the time to let folks try the interface and give us feedback before it is finalized. We just couldn't do that under the time constraints of producing Shadows of Luclin.<p>When we have a better idea when we'll be able to release the new interface, I'll let you know.<p>Alan</B><p>While I for one can't wait until the 640x480 screen is gone for good, I'm all in favor of the Verant staff working to resolve the aforementioned &quot;Luclin's Little Problems&quot; rather than starting another project. But it is nice to know that the interface change is coming sometime.<p>While on the subject of problems with Luclin, let me make a bit of an aside here. I don't really blame the programming staff for the issues we're all experiencing right now. Sure, they write the code, but they don't set release dates. Let's face facts: if the programming staff had hired a fleet of dirigibles to fly over the Verant offices trailing banners that said &quot;THE CODE IS NOT READY YET,&quot; it would not have made one bit of difference to the higher-ups at Sony who wanted to get Luclin on the shelves three weeks before Christmas. Is that an excuse for the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=477282397">myriad of problems</a> that we all experienced on Tuesday? Of course not. I just want to make sure our ire is directed at the right people.<p>Lastly, it's time to check in on everyone's favorite evil uberguild, Fires of Heaven, to see how much of Luclin they have already conquered. It seems a <a href="http://foh.noows.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4670">trip to the Ssra Temple</a> resulted in a painfully obvious lack of phat 73wtz:<p><B>Welp, we wacked the first two &quot;boss mobs&quot; tonight - no loot aside from spells. As a matter of fact, NOTHING we've killed has had any loot. <p>Amazingly enough, OLD pre-kunark loot tables of Nilitims/various pages and Runes of XXXX are back. Why? Obviously a huge mistake. <p>One massive oversight/bug, and I have mentioned it to dev's so I'm assuming it's gonna be fixed ASAP - NOTHING summons - wait, I take that back, one mob did summon - a lvl 35 Shroom in Echo Caverns - yea, level 35?! A lot of zone geometry problems/errors. Broken AEs. Mobs casting spells they have no business casting (i.e. a sub lvl 60 wizard casting Sunstrike). <p>Aside from the initial problems, though, I'm enjoying Luclin and think it's going to turn out rather nicely once beta is over.</B><p>The above was posted by the evilest of the evil, Furor. (How much more evil could he be? None more evil.) Maybe other guilds are keeping the good stuff quiet so they can ph@rm in peace before the non-733t wannabes all come pouring in, but there has been a definite absence of good stuff posted on the spoiler sites so far.<p>Ah well, Luclin is young. Let's be thankful it's taking more than two days to discover everything there is to know about the place, shall we?
