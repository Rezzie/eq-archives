<h1 class="article_title">Of Wing and Fang</h1>
<p>by Loral on February 02, 2005</p>

<p>SOE released quite a <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?article=7543">large patch</a> this week.  You can read the entire patch message here but I will highlight a few of the more interesting features.</p>

<p>Lost Dungeons received a much requested selection menu for one of the four mission types.  While this decision will certainly be popular for those who still adventure, it basically removes the assassination and rescue missions from the list.  The collection and murder spree missions are much easier than the assassination and rescue missions.  Few would ever select a mission that offers a harder difficulty for no gain in reward.</p>

<p>One of my problems with LDON is the lack of a story arc.  I actually prefer going on assassination missions because they are one of the only adventure types that has a building plot and a final confrontation.  Boss mobs and anti-heroes are important not only in video games but also in traditional fantasy.  Walking into a dungeon and killing 58 skeletons or collecting 28 bone chips doesn't have the same energy as going into a dungeon, killing 57 skeletons and then killing Ograth the Skeleton King.  </p>

<p>A better solution to the selection choice would be to make rescue and assassination missions offer up a higher reward for their difficulty.  Giving boss mobs nice loot or rescued NPCs offering up a reward for their return might have made the difference enough that people would once again select them. This change puts a band-aid on the problem of convenience.</p>

<p>SOE revamped two older zones this week including Mistmoore and Paw.  Both zones now harbor beasts above level 60.  Walking into Mistmoore at level 69, I was reminded of how I felt entering the dark castle at the young age of 30.  Mistmoore was always a very difficult dungeon and well known to eat even the heartiest of adventures.  It is nice to see it return to its former danger.</p>

<p>Part of that danger, however, came from some of the quirks of the dungeon.  Mob pathing was never very good and it wasn't uncommon to see enormous trains pour out of the castle and tear across the courtyard killing anything that moved.  That tradition remains today.  It isn't uncommon to see a mob run in the opposite direction and return with a couple of friends when you pull it.  From the item links floating through our network of channels, the loot supports the reward, but it would have been nice to have a zone whose danger didn't come from its unexpected bug-based behavior.</p>

<p>I have yet to step foot into the new paw but from the equipment I see, I imagine it is as difficult as Mistmoore was.  Paw always had one of the most difficult dungeon layouts that only the oldest old-world dungeons had.  Remember upper and lower guk?  How about Kedge Keep?  I am sure old timers wax nostalgia about the difficulty of old-world dungeons but few ever went deep into paw.   Most groups found a cozy corner near the zone and pulled what they could see.  Only adventures many levels above the zone population would dare to delve deep in and even then they had a gate potion at the ready.</p>

<p>One very small fix in this patch that had me cheering out loud was a fix to the font system.  I always preferred Verdana over Arial as a font but using such a wide font ended up breaking the item counts on stackable items.  This last patch fixed this problem.  It was a small but useful fix.</p>

<p>This patch did not implement the task changes I had hoped to see. We will not see these new tasks and task improvements until the release of Dragons of Norrath.  It would have been nice to see these new tasks before the release of the next expansion but improvements to the task system at any time will hopefully help those who prefer to hunt solo.</p>

<p>This week EQ Stratics hosted a <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/hoclogs/donhoc.php">developer chat</a> with Travis Mcgearthy and Ryan Barker of the EQLive design team to talk more about Dragons of Norrath.  This was the first time SOE discussed the details of the new Mission system with those outside of the Dragons of Norrath beta.  While a future preview of Dragons of Norrath will go into more detail on this system and the other features of DoN, I can make a few general statements on what we see so far.</p>

<p>Of all of the features of Dragons, none excite me as much as the Mission system.  The Mission system ties together the Omens of War task system, the Gates of Discord expedition system, and the Lost Dungeons adventure point system.  Players pick a particular mission, one with much greater variety than the four LDON types, and complete that mission in an instanced part of a larger dungeon zone.  Completing this mission awards a sort of currency that can be used to purchase new items.</p>

<p>There are a number of advantages to this system.  They have well-defined timeframes for completion, in this case, about an hour.  They reward every member of a group equally rather than favoring one lucky party member with random loot.  They offer gameplay variants other than sitting and hunting at a particular camping spot.</p>

<p>For those of us who thought LDON was one of the great improvements in Everquest, the Mission system answers our roar of requests.  Unlike LDON, however, Dragons features a lot of raid content (dragons!) and general overland and dungeon non-instanced zone exploration.</p>

<p>We had a busy week and I expect a few more in the future.  In the next couple of weeks I will write a preview of Dragons of Norrath that will go into further detail into these systems and the other features of this expansion.  In the mean time, lets hunt some vampires.</p>

<p>I'll admitt that the article didn't have the usual flare, but there was quite a bit to say.  I say, "Nice work."  Not every article has to spawn comments of class balance and game death within 3 hours of posting.  I wasn't aware of some the things mentioned (mainly about DoN) and found them quite interesting so I read other things elsewhere.  I like when an article makes you do that.  Well, I'm going to return to staring at my computer and pretending I'm doing something productive.... nachos sound good. <br />

<p>Out of morbid (and frustrated) curiousity, are the task improvements only going to be available to those who purchase the next expansion as a feature?  This isn't intended to be snide at all, it's just that tasks were a selling point to me with OoW, and having to get the next expansion to fix what is messed up would feel somewhat like paying for the same thing twice.</p>

<p>I imagine that any true task-system tasks will require Omens but I expect the Mission system, being it is an important feature of the expansion, will be available to everyone.</p>

<p>I will be very surprised that you will get any missions without the expansion.</p>

<p>They have split the player base by making good/evil missions mutually exclusive points wise. It make sound sense lore wise but on servers where getting a group, or at least a somewhat balanced one, is already difficult, it will make things harder.</p>

<p>Overall another LDON system should be a good thing, hopefully it will be a little more imaginative than the original LDON.</p>

<p>Btw on a bright note a friend of mine who reviews internet games and play tests some, says WoW has fallen to SOE EQ1 levels of CS along with poor patches and bugs. So Blizzard may not be bleeding off as many players as it used to. Apparently it lost a lot of its talented staff just before WoW's rushed release.</p>

<p>EQ2 is having some issues with its last big patch too....</p>

<p>BTW you could get around the good/evil mission split points wise by making the gear vendor neutral faction and able to cash points from good or evil as a single currency?</p>

<p>
<p>Blizzard was NOT prepared for the response they got to WoW - dunno if it was a staffing issue, a rushed release issue, or just a chain of bad decisions, but unfortunately now, even if they fix their ongoing CS and stability issues, they will have to spend the next two years running the game mostly flawlessly before players forgive them.</p>

<p>That's the reality of MMO players I guess.  We're hard to please, quick to anger, and we do NOT forget the sins of the past.  Publishers beware.</p>

<p>I'm not really surprised though, I mean look how much people love to hate their game's publisher.  I've known more players to complain loudly and vehemently about Sony's customer support, the bad patches, the poor planning, the horrible decisions, the spotty communication....but they also all keep playing.  I've also seen this happen to almost every other MMO publisher whose game I've been a part of.  I think what it says most is that the industry as a whole needs to really work on these areas.  There's always going to probably be a small mob waving torches and pitchforks outside the castle gates, but I dunno that I would call what I've seen on any game's forums yet "small".  Then again, I also don't think that any of the publishers really have a good way to get objective feedback from their players.  There are ways for players to voice what they feel, yeah, but they'll only do so if they feel strongly enough.  The only real thing that gets a good picture of how everyone feels about the game is a login poll of some sort.</p>

<p>EQ2 did have some problems with the last patch, which most of the players expected, because they crammed a billion things into it.  The nice thing though is that the majority of the problems, or at least the majority of the visible ones, were corrected in the hotfix the next morning.  Since most EQ2 players came from EQ1 or SWG, you almost never hear them complaining about patches anymore.  Nerfs, ok, they complain.  But us EQ2 players are for the most part used to game-breaking patches that knock people out of the game for weeks - and here we have a patch where about the worst thing it does is goof up armor colors and break a skill or two and it's fixed within 24 hours?  We don't even have time to get upset, really.  I hate to say it, but I really don't see many EQ2 people going back to EQ1 other than occasionally for nostalgia - I can't even fathom it, and I kept my EQ1 account active on purpose just in case.  Maybe that'll change when folks hit the cieling in a month or two and there's not much to do until an expansion comes out, but that's pure conjecture on my part, because no one knows just how much top end content there really is in the game right now.  So I wouldn't hold out much hope of EQ1 gaining back population from EQ2, not anytime soon.</p>

<p>As far as the technical issues, I suspect that in a year or so the EQ2 player base won't be quite so forgiving, but I've got to say that the EQ2 team is doing a hugely better job at running a stable game and not breaking things too badly overall than past SOE teams have done.  I -hope- that's indicative of changes in the company as a whole, and not just this specific game or team.</p>

<p>I think that the new LDON-ish system is a good idea, but I agree with Wombat that a good/evil split is going to cause problems.  Not just because of low player populations, but because most of the people that play EQ1 have friends and guilds that spread across the entire racial spectrum.  Talaen is a high elf paladin on the nameless, yet 3 out of 6 of the regular clerics he grouped with were dark elves.  A similar portion of the shamans were trolls or iksar.  The lore of the game has been so repressed that it's just not possible to expect players to begin taking racial alignments seriously again - what will happen, if the system attempts to force that on them, is that the system won't get used by a lot of people, who would rather group with their friends regardless of the races in the limited time they have to play.</p>

<p>From the dev chat:</p>

<p>"Rashere - The two different factions each give a different type of currency for completing their missions and, in turn, only accept that currency at their vendors. But, the currency is tradeable. "</p>

<p>
<p>Tradeable between players? or with the NPC Vendor? If between players it will depend on the player numbers balance between factions as far as the exchange rate is concerned. If 5 times the players do one faction then you can see the market imbalance.</p>

<p>Will it be sold in the Bazzar?</p>

<p>If its tradeable 1:1 at an NPC "black market" vendor then I withdraw my objection.</p>

<p>If between players then a lot will depend on which faction is the most sought after or doable if there are racial limits.</p>

<p>If Faction is important and not just points then people wont want to swap between faction quests as you wont advance the faction you want if you are constantly taking negative hits from doing faction on the other side which gives you "X"tokens to trade for the "Y"tokens that you want.</p>

<p>Basically unless its a NPC "black market" vendor then it seems far simpler to just do one faction, which will give you no opposing faction tokens to trade. Problem solved except you have split the groupable player base unless they all do the same faction quests.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Teremar on February  3, 2005 01:41 AM</strong></p>
<p>
<p>Did I hear that right? The currency is tradeable?</p>

<p>Two alternatives here. Either:</p>

<p>1) The gear you can get with it will only be an incremental improvement over what's available in the Bazaar now.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2) Raiders are going to SCREAM. They complained enough about non-raiders being able to get LDoN high-end gear just by doing instances over and over again. If you can just buy yourself a bunch of DoN currency...</p>

<p>Yes, for the first three months the currency will be rare and very valuable. But you know what happens with anything rare and valuable.</p>

<p>Oh and I didn't realize we were to the point where another game having problems is a "bright note." Blizzard admits that based on their market research they had planned for about 300,000 subscribers after one year and weren't ready for 600,000 after two months. But my server (Silver Hand--one of the original RP servers) was one of the worst hit and it's been fine for a while now. Yes, there's more they need to do, and it's too bad they had to learn the hard way about communication when SOE's been demonstrating how not to do it for years. But they've been learning fast. I wouldn't plan on too many people coming back from WoW because of server issues--it wouldn't have been so frustrating when the servers were down if the game weren't so much fun. Maybe in six months if the high end doesn't materialize as expected, but I doubt it.</p>

<p>'Raiders' is a quite a generalisation, especially in Everquest. Being one myself, I never minded non-raiders getting decent upgrades - it was never as good as EP/PoTime gear anyway (except for Augmentations of course). Keeps the game healthy, and there needs to be some way to stop the gap between raiders and non-raiders getting TOO big, otherwise we'll never have suitable applicants for raiding guilds.</p>

<p>"Oh and I didn't realize we were to the point where another game having problems is a "bright note." "</p>

<p>Yes its gallows humour, but not too far from the truth. If EQ1 has selling points they arent just its good points but other games bad points. </p>

<p>Yes WoW is a victim of its own success (and some bad management decisions). It shows how successful EQ1 could have been in a larger market if they had worked on it more a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>We will see how it goes when it toughens up content for the long haul.</p>

<p>In the meantime EQ2 and WoW only need to be successful enough to drop a mob of servers below critical mass for it to be an even bigger problem for those remaining on EQ1. And of course theres Vanguard in 12 months time.</p>

<p>Anyway I await a response on what "tradeable" means?</p>

<p>Wombat</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Teremar on February  3, 2005 12:08 PM</strong></p>
<p>
<p>You're absolutely right Tolian, and I apologize for inadvertently feeding into what I agree is a really destructive overgeneralization. Some raiders, presumably the same ones who complained about LDoN gear, will scream. Because tradeable DoN currency will separate "having good gear" from "winning tough fights" far more than LDoN ever did if the gear really is good.</p>

<p>Personally I had no trouble playing the market in the Bazaar and making lots of money, so I'd presumably do well under such a system. But it was far more satisfying to get the gear myself. Enough so that I kept at OoW for a while because it was exciting to upgrade my gear even though the fights themselves were boring.</p>

<p>But it didn't last long. Which brings me to my main point: no loot or system for distributing loot will make up for boring content. The success or failure of DoN will depend on the missions themselves. I heartily agree with Loral that they need a plot of sorts. Unique rooms. Bosses. Varied tactics both on the part of the mobs and on the part of the players if they expect to win. In short, the sort of creativity and just plain time and effort SOE regularly puts into raid content.</p>

<p>There are plenty of examples to imitate. The old dungeons like SolB, LGuk, or Old Seb (though probably more linear). Most raids, just scaled to a single group. Best of all in my opinion, force every EQ dev to level a WoW char up to 20 and fight through the Deadmines. That is EXACTLY the kind of mission EQ needs and there's nothing to prevent SOE from making missions like it in EQ.</p>

<p>For the record: I hope DoN is a great expansion and a lot of fun to play even if I don't plan to play it. I certainly hope EQ players aren't reduced to hoping other games can't keep their servers running because that's the only way EQ can compete with them.</p>

<p>
<p>Wombat - not sure if you're expressing gallows humor again, but "tradeable" means the item is >>not&lt;&lt; NODROP - you can buy/sell/trade the item(s)  with other players. I suspect you will not be able to sell the currency items to NPCs just trade them in for stuff. </p>

<p><br />
I imagine it/them being similar to the "bag of platinum" you get when you sell your horse/bridle back to the Stablehand NPC's (however these will not be NODROP which the bags are as I recall.) </p>

<p>So, if you happen to like doing missions for one faction, but like the phat lewt from the other, you'll have the ability to get the other faction currency if you can find someone to sell it to you or trade for it. I daresay the plat houses will be farming the stuff along with enterprising players with multiple toons. Should be possible to have it available in the Bazaar or Barter House (the latter being a very interesting upcoming feature that's on the Test Server right now) for your acquisition pleasure. </p>

<p>Loral was kind of busy writing up all those guides for Sony, so we got the short shrift this week. As for EQ1, I was amused to note that the war in FV zone -- which I missed hearing about because I had to log to preserve my rez timer -- had a write up on UGO/CastersRealm, with a link to it and to the discussion thread from the EQ boards. </p>

<p>By three hours later, not one person had posted a comment. Gemdiver was forced to post his own followups for discussion...</p>

<p>Lavastorm got the best revamp of all and its for lower levels.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say paw is for ubers only but as we know, the term uber means so many different things to so many different people.  Five years ago, Mistmoore at level 30 was for ubers only.</p>

<p>I do not care what anyone says.  Last night I saw the system wide message and went to Dreadlands on my Level 63 Warrior and played in the war there. I joined up in a group of people I met that night at the start of the event. We were on the good side and we lost baddly. I died 10 times.  But you know I had more fun playing there last night, and listenning to what was going on, and following the battle all the way through FV, than I have had in a couple years.  The brand new people I met were great people and we killed and died together.  I was exausted and ready for bed when it was done and I have thought about it all day long at work.  </p>

<p>Now that is gaming. That is meeting new people and new friends.  There was new Lore in the making and I was there.  I loved it!</p>

<p>Tradeable doesnt mean just with players, you may be able to trade on type of token with another via a black market NPC.</p>

<p>Anyway we will see soon enough, since no one actually seems to know at this stage.</p>

<p>By the time I logged on after work the event was over, otherwise I would report on it. I did see a few players bodies in the FV tunnel and at its exit in DL.</p>

<p>My Guild killed some Dragoons and Golems in FV but they were stock standard from OT Docks.</p>

<p>Apparently on one server the players and FV guards made a stand on the bridge into FV and held off the rampaging hordes for an hour until they were overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Some good attuneable and no drop gear dropped apparently but being an off peak Guild we didnt see any of it. Its a pity they didnt stage it out over 24 hours....</p>

<p>People with dial up couldnt even zone into areas of conflict, the lag was too great.</p>

<p>They could have events in other zones such as MM raiding GFay/BB as an opportunistic attack while defenders are tired/dead from FV at a later time in the day etc.</p>

<p>Iksars attacking Lanys later on because they werent invited to the earlier party or because "there goes the neighbourhood, Dark Elves!, Arrgh!" etc etc...</p>

<p>"Apparently on one server the players and FV guards made a stand on the bridge into FV and held off the rampaging hordes for an hour until they were overwhelmed."</p>

<p>And that right there is why these events should continue :)  That's the sort of thing that gets people excited about the lore again.</p>

<p>One of the things that Asheron's call did right was to always have some sort of a plot event at every major update.  On a regular schedule even.  The players got used to it, expected it, and in the end they looked past a lot of other problems with the game because they were having so much fun at the monthly updates.  SOE, and other publishers, need to learn that lesson as much as possible.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that DoN is the next Velious in terms of expansions.  Lots of single-group content, lots of raid content, lore matters, factions matter, quests matter.....lots of great fun for everyone.  If that happens, then I think the slow exodus of EQ1 players will stop for the most part.<br />

<p>I couldn't participate but from what I hear that's the kind of event I would like to see much more often. SoE is listening at least. Good thing.</p>

<p>What "shards" are you talking about?</p>

<p>Heh. So what you're saying is, all that info is out of date, Loral?  :-)  Relax,just "picking fun." I didn't care about the article's brevity, I read it like all the rest.  </p>

<p>The real point of my post was kind of buried in the middle, and too subtle--that happens when I get whimsical: "I missed hearing about [the war] because I had to log to preserve my rez timer."  </p>

<p>There just weren't any clerics or necros available for a rez where I had died *the night before.*  All were raiding or offline, both nights, and I was under an hour left.  That's right, I had a choice between spending an unknown amount of time /ooc'ing in POK until a rezzer was free to gouge my lite bank account for a rez--hopefully in time-- or log and come back the next night, hoping to catch a friend online. (I did.)</p>

<p>Now that's great game design: punish the player for being online and enjoying content--make him get OFFLINE to preserve his progress. (And to be clear: that's a swipe at both game design and lack of action re: population drop on servers).</p>

<p>Based on what I heard of the event and how it went on my server, had I shown up, it would have gone poorly: a lvl 65 48AA Enchanter could have hoped to ninja-loot behind some uberguild, and maybe buff, if the lvl 70's were being lazy.  If unlucky, I could have died 10 times like one warrior, and deleveled to 64 if I were unlucky enough to miss (another) rez. </p>

<p>And no, I'm not whining about being 65.  Refusing to buy OOW and DON are *my* choice; I see no point in rewarding Sony for a bass-ackwards system that emphasizes short-term expansion revenue over long-term subscriber revenue, or thinking that the first necessarily leads to the second. </p>

<p>I am sorry to hear that your server was that way. I was the Warrior that died at least 10 times.  The only time there was not any clerics to give rezzes, was during time they were running back with me to retrieve their bodies.  At least on The Nameless, even though my group had a cleric in it, I was probably rezzed just as many times from passing clerics.  <br />
I think for the whole night I lost a quarter of a percent of xp.  Yes I ran back to my body and dragged to a safe spot (well kinda safe) but my feeling was that even if I had not gotten a rez the xp lose did not come close to the experience.</p>

<p>Question? You guys are talking about things that are going to happen in next expansion. I have gone EQlive website and it never seems to have any more information than when they first listed the expansion.  Where are you guys getting your information at?<br />
