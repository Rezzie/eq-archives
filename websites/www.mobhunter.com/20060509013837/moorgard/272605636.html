The estimated downtime is 4 hours.</B><p>Hmmm, four hours is usually the smallish variety of patch. Let's hope they can squeeze in all the necessary loot updates and cheese vendor changes during that time.<p>Why do they need to update loot? Because...<p><BIG>Oh, How the Mighty Have Fallen</BIG><p>It's done. Shadows of Luclin has been finished, folks. <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/html/index.php">Fires of Heaven</a> is the first guild to kill the final boss in Vex Thal, the last of the uberzones.<p><a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">Afterlife</a> is close too, mind you, and has gotten some very nice loot as well. Hey, what would an uberzone be without a friendly (or not-so-friendly) <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/fafterlife68829afterlifemessageboard.showMessage?topicID=4476.topic">rivalry</a>?<p>Anyway, an <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27375.topic&amp;start=29&amp;stop=29">FoH monk</a> explained how the zone works:<p><B>The way the zone is set up you must kill certain bosses to despawn non-targetable mobs that port you out if you go near them. That being said there are some spots where the place splits into two and it's basicly the same thing on both sides. Going either way leads to a boss thats pretty much a copy of the other.</B><p>An interesting design, to be sure. Sounds like two friendly guilds might--<I>might</I>--be able to coexist in Vex Thal, if they agree to each take one path. That's assuming more than one guild per server ever manages to survive the timesinks needed to get enough keys for their members. We'll see--maybe not soon, but we'll see.<p>As for the loot, it's pretty darn impressive, but not revolutionary. Oh sure, there's an extra 25 HP or mana over Velious stuff, but for the most part it's not as jaw-dropping as NToV gear was when that first appeared (aside from the presence of Flowing Thought on the caster stuff). Maybe some of it will be seeing an upgrade in the upcoming patch. Considering the time invested to obtain it, some of that loot needs considerable uberfication.<p><BIG>Please Come to Boston, She Said No</BIG><p>The next FanFaire has been <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/eq-fanfaire/Forum2/HTML/000691.html">announced</a>, and will take place August 2 and 3 in Boston. Hotel rooms will run you $100 a night, or you can just crash in Absor's room for free. I hear he doesn't mind.<p>Ah well, another FanFaire beyond the reach of the Mobhunter staff. On the bright side, we figure the last one was on the West Coast, and this one will be on the East Coast, so surely the next one will be somewhere in the central USA. We're hoping for Chicago or Brewtown, personally.<p>We'll drive anywhere within a 15-hour radius for the possibility of scamming people out of cold beer.
