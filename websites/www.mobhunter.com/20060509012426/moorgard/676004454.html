Attacks that do a lot of damage in a short time no longer cause more aggro than they should.<p>- Feign Death has been restored to the functionality it had before the patch.<p>- Fixed an issue that caused aggro from damage shields to be assigned incorrectly.<p>- Removed a bug that could cause certain types of encounters, such as the Rallos Zek encounter in the Plane of Tactics, to crash a zone.<p>- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when you tried to bring up the item display window for bags and notes.</B><p>If you threw a rock at any ranger or caster message board since Tuesday, more than likely you'd hit a thread in which someone was screaming how horribly broken aggro was. Basically anyone who did a large amount of damage in a short amount of time (henceforth referred to as &quot;burst damage&quot;) stood a good chance of drawing aggro. This was especially prominent in cases of critical hits and nukes. Absor's comments made it clear that this wasn't intended to be the case, and sure enough the devs were pretty quick to provide a fix.<p>Personally, I think that having burst damage cause major aggro isn't a bad idea if a skilled tank has the tools necessary to counter it. The problem is that having taunt be too good will trivialize any encounter, so fixing the skill isn't as simple as increasing its effectiveness in every situation.<p>The <a href="http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=3581&amp;sid=37b94e6ea8c28c7e6c84a3f00d37643a">change to damage shields on Tuesday</a> was interesting, and nobody was sure if it was intended or not. Basically, the DS was generating extra aggro for the person who had it because it was being counted as damage done by that person. This made powerleveling even easier than before, because a noob could be given cleric buffs and a damage shield and proceed to gain about 30 levels in no time without doing a single point of actual damage. On the higher end of the game, this change was really nice for tanks, because it gave a bit of extra taunt based on their damage shield. But as was made clear by today's fix, the change to DS spells was never meant to be.<p>The fixing of various zone-crash bugs is a good thing, of course, as GMs were running around killing Xegony across all servers to prevent bad things from happening. The bag/note bug received far less attention, but fixing it is a good thing anyway.<p>And then we have the monks. Their three days of bliss about the mitigation fix are over, and now they have a new cause courtesy of the <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=38440.topic">feign death reversion</a>. The rallying cry of the disgruntled is that it took six months to fix a class disadvantage and three days to fix an advantage, thus SOE is out to get them (hates the class, ignores their message board, blah blah blah).<p>Nevermind the fact that the mitigation nerf was a deliberate balance decision and the feign death change was an unintended bug. Nor should the dev team be praised for only taking three days to fix said bug; clearly they should have let it linger on for months, allowing the community to get used to it, at which point monks could again use the argument that it had existed that way for so long that it had become a feature and they had a god-given right to keep it.<p>Yes, I'm being harsh (you should have seen it before I edited!), but the irrationality of one's own class can be overwhelmingly frustrating at times. After three days of 100% aggro wipe with FD, I can admit that the skill was a little too good. While the idea of an AA ability that allows a kind of super-FD with aggro wipe has merit, it would have to be around a 72-minute recycle time to prevent the trivialization of content. As for monks, they will survive. The skill has been this way for two years, and three days of being spoiled won't change that.<p>Hopefully this whole FD fiasco will lead to clearer communication between Test users and the dev team. Right here on Mobhunter, Absor <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=-558708463&amp;msgid=1800227486#message">researched claims</a> that the feign death change was the subject of petitions and /bug reports of Test server monks for a month before it went live. Alan may not have gone far enough back to find them, but in any case, he made clear the best way for Test players to help catch this stuff:<p><B>If you play on Test and you find a bug, PLEASE use the /bug function to report them. Posting on a guild message board, sending in a /petition or a /feedback is NOT reporting a bug. All our programmers, testers and many of our designers and artists read those bug reports every day.</B><p>From the sound of it, GMs on Test frequently ask players to /petition bugs. While this may get GM attention, it does not guarantee that the devs will find out about it. That's arguably a communication problem at SOE, but the best way around it is to always use the /bug form to report actual bugs.<p>Apparently not fixed in today's patch is a mysterious problem that is affecting an awful lot of users who have been <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/039946.html">unable to log into the game</a> since Tuesday. Getting to the EULA screen causes an unavoidable lockup. There doesn't seem to be much of a common denominator to the situation, but since these players can log onto Test, the dev team does seem to be getting <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/040230.html">closer to a solution</a>:<p><B>The developers are working very hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible, patching the test server, and testing it to be sure its good to push to the live servers. I'm sorry for the trouble, please be patient with us.</B><p>This doesn't appease the players who are rightfully upset that they haven't been able to play, though. Hopefully fixing this is a high priority for the team right now.<p>Finally, it's not entirely clear whether problems with the rogue <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=27819.topic">shroud of stealth</a> ability or <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=777856fdd07eb4c31f809361619214dd&amp;threadid=14989&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1">odd healing delays</a> were fixed, but that should be apparent soon.<p>All in all, it wouldn't be surprising to see more files being patched soon, though whether the servers would have to come down for that to happen remains to be seen.<p>Ah, patchin'. Good times.
