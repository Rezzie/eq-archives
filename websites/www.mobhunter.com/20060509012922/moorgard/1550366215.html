The estimated downtime is 4 hours.</B><p>Will the druid and shaman healing spells be going live at last? Tune in Thursday to see what <a href="http://www.suntimes.co.za/2002/08/25/backpage/back01.asp">hot changes</a> are in store for our favorite game.<p><BIG>Look Out--Cavity Creeps!</BIG><p>The latest <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/">prologue to the Planes of Power</a> features a trip to the Plane of Decay to visit old Double X himself--Bertoxxulous. Seems Inny sent a messenger to visit Bert (or &quot;The Tox,&quot; as his friends call him) to try to enlist the rotting one's help with something. While the text of the prologue is obscure (as per usual), Mobhunter managed to translate Innoruuk's message:<p>&quot;Please, for the love of the Nameless, UPGRADE MY LOOT! Or at the very least, let me move into a real plane with you! PLEASE!!! The Maestro won't stop playing that damned piano and it's driving me CRAZY!&quot;<p>It seems that Bert wasn't real interested in helping Inny, so the god of Hate will just have to stay in the Plane of Bad Pathing and put up with having the Maestro constantly touching his organ.<p>Uhhh... anyway...<p>Speaking of the planes, there has been an interesting thread on the Safehouse that lists the <a href="http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11982.topic">zone names</a> from the PoP expansion and discusses some of the game lore behind the gods and planes. Since we're now less than a month from the target release date, you might want to start getting those new raid locations in mind.<p><BIG>The 'Spoit Is in the Bag</BIG><p>Over on the Fires of Heaven board, Furor (why have I never noticed Moz's wisdom in his sig file before?) discusses a <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2942">nasty exploit</a> that allows players to modify their EQ directory to bypass things liked locked doors and other game geometry. Turns out this bug has been known about since the days of Kunark, and has been used for quite some time by gimps who can't play the game as it was intended. The late, great Tigole imparted the story of a 48 monk on his server who told Tig that he could get into Sleeper's Tomb even though there was no way he could have a key:<p><B>So sure enough the level 48 monk zones into ST. I do a bunch of /who all _his name_ and log it. I report and petition, hoping to get the guy caught in the act. <p>Then the monk DIES in ST to the first golem. Now I am thinking to myself, &quot;we have this guy caught red handed!&quot; <p>I stay online for approximately 3 hours. I had petitioned something along the lines of, &quot;I need to speak with a GM immediately -- a game altering exploit has been brought to my attention.&quot; <p>Anyway, 3 hours later I get the old, &quot;Greetings, Tigole! Guide So-and-so at your service! How can I help you.&quot; <p>I explain the situation to him. The guide refuses to believe me that this monk could not possibly have gotten his own key. Then the guide says to me, &quot;Well, perhaps someone just opened the door for him and let him inside?&quot; <p>After about 20 minutes of explaining how Everquest works to the guide, I finally convince the Guide to go look for the monk's corpse. The Guide, for some reason keeps asking me where Sleepers Tomb is (I thought they could port and what not).</B><p>As you can imagine, the guide in question wasn't much help and no GM ever contacted Tigole about the situation.<p>At any rate, this bug deserves the spotlight right now. There is a new expansion a month away that includes content that is either keyed or meant to be progressed through, and bugs like this jeopardize the integrity of that content. Gimp players take the path of least resistance, and somebody somewhere will try to take advantage of this situation.<p>In the days when there were GMs assigned to each server, it wouldn't be such a worry. Part of the server GM's job was knowing what guilds had access to which high-end content, so if a level 48 unguilded noob suddenly turned up in Vex Thal, a bell would go off in the GM's head that alerted him something fishy was afoot. Now, in the age of GM by committee, there exists the potential that such exploits might go unnoticed.<p>Taking advantage of flaws in game design to advance your character is one thing, but deliberatly hacking files to bypass game content is something else entirely. Let's hope this issue can be addressed before the Planes of Power are compromised.<p><BIG>Some Enchanted Evening</BIG><p>Enchanters are one of those classes that you just kind of take for granted. Sure, you want one around if you're going to do exp in a tough spot, but unless you play one you don't spend a lot of time considering their place in the universe. For instance, no exp group wants <I>two</I> enchanters around, because they are a class that doesn't &quot;stack&quot; well in most situations. While a few raids (such as some of the upper-end Ssra encounters) are the exception, having an abundance of enchanters at an event usually leads to a bunch of bored chanters buffing and runing other classes.<p>A player named Ades recently <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2964">discussed enchanter issues</a> and made some good suggestions for allowing the class to feel more useful. Foremost in the discussion is CC (crowd control), the area that enchanters are supposed to excel in:<p><B>There should be enough content to keep 3 or 4 encs busy, not only one... Large amounts of CC content in raids, when its wisely implemented, doesn't trivialize but rather increase the challenge...<p>A good example of balanced CC are the planes of Fear and Hate as were done before Kunark. Large numbers of mobs, all mezzable but also highly resistant. No 100% safe spells (Rapture and equivalent song) avaliable. CC was dangerous, challenging and rewarding. Encs were needed, but not overpowered; they didn't replace or lower the need for other classes below what is reasonable, but complemented them...<p>CC should be required all along like tanking and healing, a requirement which due its importance and risk increases the challenge... Large numbers of unsplittable mobs, too many to be handled without excellent CC, will increase the challenge on the raid and need for the currently redundant enchanters.</B><p>There are other intersting points in the piece, including the rise of other forms of crowd control: bards, monk FD splitting, and &quot;tank mez,&quot; where tanks are used to keep unmezzable mobs at bay. The point is that while no one class should have a monopoly on any role, there should still be a definite master of that art; clerics and healing is a good example of this concept. While clerics recently received an expanded role in exp groups and soloing, the enchanter hasn't seen much tweaking.<p>To be fair, caster balancing is still in progress, and Verant may well have plans in motion to increase the value of having multiple enchanters on raids. But just in case they don't, Waters and company should take a look at threads like the one above and another taking place on the enchanter class boards (which are unfortunately buried in the dense hierarchy of Casters Realm's message board system). Here a poster named Maldisdain makes <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=76928">more excellent points</a>:<p><B>I actually think that High Priest is an example of an encounter that was, for the most part, well written. You have massive adds... several of whom are unmezable, but the majority of whom can be mezed with GoK/Dazzle. Theoretically, an enchanter can hold up to eight or ten adds solo... if he does a spectacular job. But there is <I>also</I> a place for up to six or seven enchanters. <p>I agree that 100% reliable mezes should not be the norm, though I like the idea of a rapture-type spell that can be used to temporarily (and for <I>extremely</I> high cost) take a mob out of combat to buy time to mez other adds. <p>What we need is a return to Dazzle-like spells. Spells with a long duration, slight recast delay, and a normalish resist check, that simply have a higher level cap. These allow an enchanter to <I>theoretically</I> control <I>massive</I> numbers of adds for a short time. <p>At the same time, however, encounters need to be designed so that it is more advantageous to ultimately <I>kill</I> the adds than to simply hold them mezed for 45 minutes or an hour. (Ades touched on this somewhat, suggesting low hps for the mobs. I agree. Furthermore, the zone structure needs to be such that in the process of moving from point A to point B there are simply <I>too many</I> mobs to simply mez for the whole trip.)</B><p>Why do I bring all this up now? Well, partly because Snowspinner likes to bug me with issues like this at three o'clock in the morning, and hopefully now he will leave me the hell alone. But really, a lot of these issues touch on the very nature of game design and class balance, and they deserve a close look. While Planes of Power is pretty much in the bag at this point, there is still another year before EQ2 sees the light of day. If the sequel's team is kept aware of issues like these, the next game will be all the stronger for it.<p>Or maybe I just want to appear as if I don't hate casters. Well, not <I>all</I> of them, at least.
