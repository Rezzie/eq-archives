Potential buyers read a review and soon find themselves buried under a heap of mumbo-jumbo, when all they really want to know is whether their games will look better and play more smoothly if they plunk down the cash for this expensive new video card. Additionally, almost all video card reviews use games like Quake 3 and whatever the hot new shooter is to benchmark their performance, so understanding how a new card would affect your EverQuest playtime is rather hard to deduce. Providing such information is the goal of this article.<p>Let me begin by stating that I'm far from being a hardware expert. This isn't going to be a discussion about memory bus architecture or size of processor cores; I will refer you to <a href="">AnandTech</a> or <a href="">Tom's Hardware</a> for very thorough details about the technical aspects of video cards.<p>What are my qualifications for writing this article, then? Well, I've built my own computers for around a decade, and have owned more video cards than I care to remember. I keep my toes wet in the ocean of computer hardware, and I figure I know more than most do about what makes for a zippy-yet-reliable computer system.<p>Okay enough prologue; let's get down to it.<p>The GeForce 3 chipset is nVidia's current top dog, and as of the beginning of this month, it comes in two flavors and prices:<p>GeForce 3 Ti 500 - $320+<br>GeForce 3 Ti 200 - $175+<p>(Check <a href="http://www.pricewatch.com/">Price Watch</a> for the most current mail-order pricing or check AnandTech's <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/guides/showdoc.html?i=1545&amp;p=4">pricing guide</a>.)<p>Both of these cards have recently arrived, taking the place of the first series of GeForce 3 cards. For the record, the performance of the plain vanilla GeForce 3 (which can be found at clearance for as little as $250) falls between the Ti 500 and Ti 200. It is the <a href="http://www.pny.com/home/products/Vcard_GeForce3.cfm">PNY Verto GeForce 3</a> card that a bought a few months ago for my own system.<p>I upgraded from the Voodoo 5 AGP card to the GeForce 3. The V5 had been a very stable card, and looked great while playing EQ--especially with full-screen anti-aliasing (FSAA). This feature smooths the jagged edges that you see on any lines that aren't straight horizontal or vertical. FSAA makes a huge difference in image quality, and I can't imagine playing EQ without it anymore.<p>However, FSAA came at a big price on the Voodoo 5 card. Framerates dropped quite a bit, especially in zones with lots of polygons. This has lead to what I consider to be the &quot;standard&quot; benchmark for video cards in EverQuest: what I call the Burning Woods test.<p>Zoning into Burning Woods from Dreadlands is pretty much the worst performance I could find in the game. All those swaying trees made for ridiculously low frame rates with the Voodoo 5--even on a 1 gHz Athlon CPU. The early GeForce 2 cards weren't much better, though latter versions of that chipset did make big improvements in that regard.<p>So how does the GeForce 3 rate in the BW test? I'm pleased to report that frame rates in this zone as well as Warsilik's Woods and Wakening Land--two other zones with similar issues--are very smooth.
