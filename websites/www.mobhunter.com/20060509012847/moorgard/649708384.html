Things we've asked for and almost given up on, despite <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-841085151">reports</a> that Verant was still tinkering with class balance. It seems the faithful have been rewarded. Read on:<p><B>September 18th, 6:00pm<br>-------------------------<p>** Melee changes **<p>We're wrapping up an extensive look at the way that melee works in EverQuest.  These changes are appearing now on Test (in fact, most of them are working as of right now).  We wanted to make you aware of these changes in some detail so that you can give us the feedback that we need on them.  Please try these changes out and comment on results that you've seen.<p>* Melee Tables *<p>Melee combat is based, at least in part, on tables that determines how each class functions.  Up until 50th level melee and hybrid classes are on the same table, with the exception being monks who are on a separate table (one that has them doing more damage).  At 50th level warriors,<br>rogues and rangers were all moved to the monk table along with the monk, who did not receive a new separate table.<p>The problem here is that post 50th level the disparity between these two tables, combined with lower combat abilities for the hybrids as well as a more restricted selection of weapons acted as a double (almost triple) penalty, making them less effective in combat than was really intended.<p>Therefore, all melee and hybrid classes will be basing their combat off the melee table once they reach 51st level.  This should increase the combat effectiveness of hybrids noticeably.<p>Monks, however, are intended to be somewhat better at dealing out damage in combat than warriors.  To slightly improve their combat prowess they will be working from an improved combat table once they reach 55th level and again at 60th level.  This will improve the combat ability of monks somewhat, essentially placing them a half a step ahead of everyone else in toe-to-toe combat in the same way that they were prior to 50th level.  The rogue will still maintain a margin of superiority when you consider their ability to backstab.<p>* Two-Handed Weapons *<p>The effectiveness of these weapons falls slightly below our desire for them.  This tends to make those that rely on them most often (shadowknights and paladins) also fall slightly behind our desires for their damage output, at least at levels beyond 50.  We'd also like to see a broader range of weapons used by higher level warriors, and it would be nice to see two-handers as a more viable option.<p>Therefore, we will be increasing the minimum damage of these weapons for all classes once they reach 50th level.  There will be an increase in the minimum damage of two-handed weapons based on the wielder's level and delay of the weapon.  The higher level the character and the larger the delay, the bigger the bonus.  Obviously we're not going to give out exact numbers, but this should result in a solid increase in damage output when using two-handed weapons.<p>We also believe that there has been a bit of disparity between the very high-end one-handed weapons and their counterpart two-handed weapons. The ultra-high end one-handed weapons are comparatively better than their two-handed counterparts.  We will, on a case by case basis, be improving many of the high-end two-handed weapons.  Because this is essentially a fix for an oversight on our parts, we will be making these changes retroactive (meaning you won't have to trade the items in or hunt for new ones, existing weapons will just change).<p>* Rangers *<p>We've also noticed that rangers, while intended to be hit harder in combat than other melee/hybrid classes, are getting hit harder than we planned.  Again, this only happens in the 50+ level range.  So we will be increasing the defense cap for rangers again slightly to 210 at 60th level.  Exactly how these points will be distributed is uncertain, but probably just one point per level after 50.  We will also be giving rangers triple attack.<p>* Monks *<p>Monks will be getting triple attack.  This along with the improvement of their combat tables should place them about where we want them, combat-wise.<p>* Bards *<p>Bards are indeed intended to have the least ability to deal damage physically of all the classes we're discussing.  However, with their lack of double attack they didn't meet even our intentions for their damage output.  We will, therefore, be raising the offense and one-handed weapon caps for bards over 50th level to match that of warriors.  This should place their ability to do damage by means of melee within our intended range without making them more effective than the knights at any given level, since double attack is a potent melee skill that bards do not get.<p>Obviously we want to see how this all pans out when applied to the game.  Feel free to send your comments on the results you see to us through the Developer's Corner on our web site, or contact our staff if you see them on the Test Server.<p>It is very important that you understand that these are changes that we are testing.  These changes (and any others made on the Test Server) may not be moved to Live Servers.  After all, that's the reason we're testing them.<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>The Safehouse community, of course, is already <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">discussing</a> the changes. While most everyone in their right mind is joyous about these changes, there are some dissenters.<p>After all, you'll notice that rogues and warriors aren't receiving any changes, at least on this list.<p>Some would say this is unfair to those two classes. If you think back to the fabled class balance threads that Abashi started (you know, the ones that disappeared when the Verant message board was transformed), rogues had a list of things they felt they needed, and warriors only really had one or two. Even so, when so many classes receive such massive upgrades, those classes unaffected may feel ignored.<p>Such a view is shortsighted, of course. Warriors and rogues have been balanced with each other, but not with any other melee class. Since Kunark's release, warriors and rogues saw themselves vault to the top of the melee heap in pretty much every way. Not only did warriors receive damage upgrades that put them on par with monks, they received the only really vital discipline (defensive) and had a massive hitpoint advantage. Rogues became the high-end damage dealers, plain and simple. With double backstab, the amount of punishment a rogue could dish out became extraordinary. In addition, their formerly ancillary skills--pick locks, detect and disarm traps--became vital again, making them a far more useful class than than other melee, save warriors.<p>Thankfully, these changes on Test should make melee classes other than warriors and rogues useful in the high-end game. Monks will do more toe-to-toe damage like in the old days, rangers get a much-needed defensive boost, bards get a shot in the arm, and the upgrading of two-handed weapons means that paladins and shadowknights will receive a desperately needed damage upgrade.<p>The improvement of specific two-handed weapons is interesting as well. It sounds like this means changes to the damage/delay ratio itself, probably on things like priceless/primal weapons, of which the one-handed variety was infinitely more desirable than the two-handed counterpart. Two-handers received an upgrade in the past, but it obviously wasn't enough to convince a dual-wielding class to use one. Let's see if Verant has figured out a way to make such a switch compelling.<p>So why should rogues and warriors (and casters, for that matter) be happy about this, despite the fact that they didn't receive any improvements themselves? Because, folks, you need to think globally--what is best for the game overall, and for your raids in particular. <B>Every</B> improvement that <B>any</B> class receives helps your guild's/raid's/party's chances of success. Relish these improvements--don't disparage something that will ultimately make the game better for everyone who plays it.<p>Rogues and warriors are the bar by which other melee classes are measured. Thankfully, Verant is finally recognizing this fact, and making adjustments accordingly.<p>As for casters and priest classes, I would expect a round of balancing coming for you as well. It's probably better for Verant to release melee and spell balance changes separately, so that careful attention can be paid to each aspect of the game.<p>Whatever you believe the reasons for these changes might be--fear of competition or an honest intention to do this all along--lots of people have something to smile about.<p>And I don't know about you, but I really needed that.
