We can't really tell, since we can't see how many people are on a given server anymore, but Absor made a rather <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000359.html">curious</a> post asking some questions of current and former SZ players:<p><B>Sullon Zek has been up and running Live for a while now. Many of you are still playing there and having fun. But some of you have tried it out and decided that it wasn't the server for you...If you played on Sullon Zek for a while and then left the server, why did you leave?</B><p>This will no doubt be ammended with a followup post explaining that no, the server is not in trouble; they just want player feedback. Just you wait and see!<p>Alan also brought attention to the announcement about an upcoming <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000360.html">EQ comic book</a>. In another time and place this would have been a cool thing, but since these days they make comic books for every bad sci-fi movie and teenage rock idol, our expectations are pretty low.<p>Although Absor briefly poked his head into Ester the Tester's thread on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000358.html">broken quests</a>, it's actually Abashi who seems to have taken the ball and run with it. Abashi's comments are short, to the point, and a bit curt... kind of gives you flashbacks to the days when he was Verant's point man for customer interaction. While his heart's in the right place, lets just say that having Abashi in a more behind-the-scenes roll is a good thing for all involved.<p>Finally, in the return of the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000330.html">warm, fuzzy thread</a>, Absor revisits the notion of what inspires you to create the character you do. One EQ player attempts to explain the phenomenon of why real life males enjoy playing female avatars:<p><B>Then it occured to me that I had never played a female character in my entire history of roleplaying (and I've been roleplaying for over 15 years now). It was a challenge. COuld I slip into this character like many actors their roles? COuld I think enough like a woman to not appear a freak? TO this day I finally thank god for not having a father or any brothers when I was growing up....having three sisters and your mother around constantly helped observe female behavior  (although I STILL don't understand women, LOL).</B><p>Read EQ-related message boards long enough and you'll be able to spot the telltale signs of a player who could use a good therapist. This poor <a href="http://www.fuali.com/Online_Tests/geek/">bastard</a> better hope there's a cleric handy to res Sigmund Freud, because we're talking some serious <a href="http://www.phillyburbs.com/burlingtoncountytimes/news/news/41215896.htm">issues</a> here.<p>But then, he/she's not the only one with <a href="http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/news/news.pl?y=2001&amp;m=10&amp;nid=22-159.db">problems</a>, so who are we to judge?
