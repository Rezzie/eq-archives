Not only is the premium service fixing up its Web-based character management, but it turns out that subscribers will be getting another new zone before us ghetto folk. Jaggedpine Forest will be a 40+ zone on Antonica, presumably off Surefall Glade.<p>Another level 40ish zone is fine, and at least druids will be able to get folks there (though Surefall is a ways from a wizard portal). Let's hope this forest will see more action than the freebie zones tacked onto Odus (Stonebrunt Mountains is a pretty place, but a waste of resources). Fans of the original world map have also been waiting for sign of the Unkempt Wood, but whether we'll ever see that zone remains uncertain.<p>How long until the regular servers get Jaggedpine? Tough to say. We still don't have that Marauder's Mire thing--not that folks are clamoring for it.<p><BIG>Physically Underwhelming</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000583.html">commented</a> last week on why hybrids are the only ones to get the Physical Enhancement ability among their alternate advancement skills. PE (an abbreviation that no doubt conjures unpleasant memories for many an EQ junkie) adds an additional 2% to Natural Durability, Combat Agility, and Combat Stability. Alan's explanation, however, is a bit lacking:<p><B>Let's assume that a theoretical hybrid was 75% as effective as a warrior in each of those melee aspects (the warrior being the base at 100%).<p>If we boost the warrior's ability by 5% (of the 100) he gains 5%. If we boost the hypothetical hybrid by 5% (of the 75) he gains (gets out a calculator) 3.75%.<p>So the warrior with one level of the skill is 105% and the hybrid is 78.75%.<p>So rather than the hybrid being 25% less than the warrior, he's 26.25% less...<p>As you add the levels of these bonuses up, you end up increasing the gap between the hypothetical hybrid's melee skills and those of the warrior.<p>Now there was indeed much discussion about this, because if you look at it the other way, the hybrid is still 75% of the warrior (105 x .75 = 78.75). But in the end we decided to allow the hybrids to purchase a little more effectiveness.<p>That's why it's only available to the hybrids.</B><p>At first glance that seems to make sense... but it doesn't. Absor's fancy math would come into play if PE impacted offensive power, but all three of the archetype abilities that Physical Enhancement affects are defensive in nature. Paladins and SKs are already the defense-oriented hybrids, and don't really need a boost in that regard as compared to warriors--the normal gains from ND, CS, and CA are enough. The defensive gap does affect rangers, rogues, and monks, however, which are the three classes that <I>should</I> be given Physical Enhancement.<p>It's unlikely that paladins and SKs will have PE taken away from them, and it probably isn't likely that PE will be added to monks and rogues, even though it should. I guess rangers are really the fortunate ones in this case. And while Absor's attempt at higher math is certainly laudable, it would help if the reasoning behind it was more sound.<p><BIG>Some Whine with That Cheese</BIG><p>So I login to EQ late Thursday night to say hello to my guildmates, and all anyone is talking about is cheese--how annoying cheesemakers are, how stupid cheese is, and so on. It seems that while I was gone, somebody figured out that people could make cheese and sell it to vendors for an outrageous profit. Suddenly newbies had thousands of plat, and server economies everywhere were thrown into chaos. Or something.<p>Naturally, of course, server GMs went around <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=1620.topic">killing the vendors</a> that supplied some necessary ingredient or whatever. Honestly, I don't know the recipe and don't want to hear it, because I'm tired of hearing about cheese for the last five days.<p>How bad was the impact on the economy? Tough to say. Some players made <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=1624.topic">an awful lot of cash</a> with this apparently obvious exploit, though mature servers have a ton of money in circulation anyway. More serious is what might have been done to the newest non-split server, Kane Bayle. I suspect it will be a while before all the repercussions are known.<p>I'm just glad I missed most of this cheese business. I mean, I love the stuff, and pizza is one of the staples of my diet, but if you ask me, Norrath is better off with batwing crunchies and Gnome kabobs. Let's save the cheese making for the professionals.<p><BIG>Las Vegas Redux</BIG><p>If you've never been to Vegas, you should go. The town isn't just about gambling anymore--though of course that pastime does provide the city's financial foundation. Vegas is about BIG--big hotels, big sights, big thrills. It's an adult Disneyland on steroids that never stops. Words cannot accurately convey the immense scale and attention to detail of experiences like Paris or New York, New York, nor can they capture the beauty of the dancing fountains of Bellagio or the gorgeous interiors of The Venetian. Go see it all for yourself.<p>Even more stunning was visiting Hoover Dam. Now, normally a big slab of concrete wouldn't really do much for me, but the immensity of this project honestly inspires awe. When you consider that the design and planning of this place was begun 70 years ago, it's quite humbling, even compared to those amazing casinos. Hoover Dam really is one of the wonders of the modern world, and anyone with an appreciation for history should definitely make the trip.<p>I didn't do much gambling--I think I pissed away about $40 total on slot machines. They give you free drinks while you play, but &quot;free&quot; is, of course, a relative term. And if you go, bring a damn good pair of walking shoes or lots of money for cab fare, because the Strip is miles and miles of stuff to see.<p>How long until Verant holds a FanFaire in Vegas? The Excalibur seems like an obvious setting for one. The question, of course, would be how much we'd all want to think about EverQuest with so many distractions around. But that's a gamble--if you'll pardon the obvious pun--we'd be willing to take.<p>Vegas, baby. Vegas!
