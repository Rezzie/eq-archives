Rats.<p><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/index.shtml">Legacy of Steel</a> has declared war on the Avatar of War. How does that work, exactly? Can one declare war on the personification of war itself? Go have yourself a <a href="http://www.mountaindew.com/code_red/code_red_main.html">tasty beverage</a> and debate the philosophical implications. By the way, notice how gracious Tigole is toward the other guilds LoS was working with? Might serve as a lesson for those less-than-polite guilds on other servers that great things can be done if you check the egos at the door and just have fun.<p>Irontaail of Triton continues to play around in the Plane of Mischief, and has discovered the way to make <a href="http://www.knightsofthecreed.com/pom/items.htm">class-specific armor</a>. The monk stuff, at least, is so-so, but the work he's doing is very cool. If only he could convince his guild to update their <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/">Web page</a>.<p>I'm not sure if other servers are having this problem, but last night on Xev a number of zones crashed and were down for several hours. If you had a character logged out in one of those zones, you were out of luck. If you had a corpse in one of those zones, your corpse went bye-bye. There was a flood of petitions, let me tell you.<p>Okay, that's all I got. If you have something juicy to discuss, please add a reply to this article. Otherwise, go back to farming gems/exp/Seb/whatever and hope the zone doesn't come crashing down around you.
