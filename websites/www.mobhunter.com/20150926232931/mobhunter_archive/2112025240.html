<html><head><title>Attack of the Clowns</title></head><body><h1>Attack of the Clowns</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-05-15</p><BIG>There's Something Familiar About This</BIG><p>Scott Hartsman, EQ's Technical Director, stopped by Graffe's to <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=16508.topic">announce</a> that the team has tracked down the solution to a rather nasty bug that has been affecting wizards. It seems that if a wizard has a 54+ familiar buff icon up without the animation, and the wizard goes linkdead and dies, the wiz gets stuck at his or her bind point, can't talk in guildchat, can't get a res, and has to be restored back to a previous save, potentially losing experience or items gained. Hartsman explained the situation:<p><B>Thanks in large part to the details provided by everyone in their discussions with GMs, our testers were able to reliably reproduce this today.<p>Once we could make it happen at will, fixing the bug became a considerably simpler matter, and we jumped all over this one. <p>The fix was patched to the test server earlier tonight.<p>** In the meanwhile, if you want to prevent this from happening, do not use /pet get lost to retain the familiar buff. **<p>The familiar can't hurt you when it dies anymore, so there's not much beyond the targetting/sound cost of keeping it alive.</B><p>This annoys me chiefly because wizard familiars are like little floating boxes of lag. Drake models in particular seem to tax system resources, and having several wizards with these familiars flapping around can really kill framerates. Screw wizards--this bug needs to be fixed in the name of everyone who doesn't have a 2 gHz processor or better!<p><BIG>The Tides That Bind</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000578.html">responded</a> to a player's question as to whether binding in Timorous Deep is officially allowed or if it was just a bug introduced in the last patch:<p><B>Yes and no.<p>This was something we were looking at changing some time in the future. As part of playing around with the idea, we initiated code on the Test server that allowed casters to bind in Timorous Deep again. That was probably six weeks ago, just after we stopped patching code for such a long time.<p>When it came time to patch code again the change to Timorous Deep went live, in a rather untested and unintended fashion. That's why it's not working perfectly, and that's why it's working at all. ;p<p>After pushing forward our examination of the idea of re-enabling binding in Timorous Deep, we've decided to allow it. However, because the implementation wasn't planned to go in quite yet, we haven't assigned the time to clear out the bugs. We'll hunt them down when we get the chance.<p>So my suggestion would be to hold off binding yourself there until we get a shot at testing the change and patching the bugs.</B><p>As I said before, Luclin has made binding in TD almost a non-issue. Unless you have a real fondness for cities, or detest waiting a maximum of 15 minutes for a port, there's not much cause to bind in the firepot room.<p>Besides, Planes of Power is supposed to provide a fast means of transportation around Norrath. Maybe the firepots in the cities will be unlocked at last.<p><BIG>Have Trap, Will Travel</BIG><p>Some other reader <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000580.html">told Absor</a> that traps in Ssra Temple seem to be coming loose and following players around the zone. So was this some intentionally sneaky snake trick? Quoth Alan:<p><B>While I think it's a very funny concept, it wasn't intentional. We'll try to nail their little feet to the ground with the next patch.</B><p>Traps that follow a player around are funny, unless of course they're following you. Still, driving nails through their feet seems a bit harsh. Is there some society for the prevention of cruelty to traps? Hopefully the SPCT will pursue Absor and make him pay for being so unkind to those poor critters.<p><BIG>I Don't Care If It's Cloudy or Bright</BIG><p>A reader named Thud Muffin (no, I'm not kidding) alerted us to a thread on the shadowknight board <a href="http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=8e45d4ab5c843bbc7167ebf81580fc71&amp;threadid=1544&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1">discussing changes</a> to their level 9 spell Disease Cloud. Seems the recent patch that decreased the aggro generated by disease-based spells (intended to prevent the splattered guts of shamans from decorating dungeon floors everywhere) also reduced the effectiveness of this popular SK spell, which even some level 60s were using as a massive taunt. Absor dropped by the thread and <a href="http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=8e45d4ab5c843bbc7167ebf81580fc71&amp;threadid=1544&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=3">posted</a> something that stirred quite a bit of ire:<p><B>Disease Cloud is a 9th level spell. I think it's pretty odd that any change to a 9th level spell would/should be important to 50+ level SKs. <p>This, to me, indicates that there's something wrong. A 9th level spell probably shouldn't be so useful that it's a problem for such high level characters. <p>There are other, better and higher level spells that you can use to taunt. Yes, they cost more mana. But, if you look at this from the perspective of the game at large, what real sense does it make that high level SKs are using a low level spell? <p>I'm just not convinced that this needs to be changed.</B><p>To which shadowknights responded (for pages and pages and pages and pages) that many caster classes use low-level spells all the way to level 60--paladins use fast, low-level stuns to hold aggro, clerics use Divine Aura all the time, etc. Absor later responded that he understood their point about the usefulness of the spell, but SKs continued to go on for pages and pages and pages and pages anyway.<p>The point is that shadowknights see their ability to taunt a mob and hold aggro as being one of--if not <I>the</I>--class-defining ability they possess. Disease Cloud was a handy, low-cost and low-casting time method of holding aggro, and they are hoping to be able to retain its usefulness.<p>Some shadowknights in the thread argue that there already exist better alternative taunt spells, and Absor's attention is best reserved for SK issues like weapon availability and damage output. Well, at least he's reading your board--or he was, until the thread got pages and pages and pages and pages long.<p>Less is more. Then again, I'm one to talk--and talk and talk and talk and talk.<p><BIG>And Now, a Word from the Opposing Party</BIG><p>Yes, this is an EverQuest new/opinion/whatever site, but bear with us while we veer off on a tangent for a minute.<p>Gamespy has a <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/pressrelease.asp?id=1056">press release</a> for a DAoC expansion called Dark Age of Camelot: Shrouded Isles&auml; to be released in &quot;late 2002.&quot; Besides the timing, a couple other facts are interesting:<p><B>As previously announced, the expansion will include a significant graphical upgrade to the game by utilizing DirectX 8.1 and the new NetImmerse 3D engine version 4.0 from Numerical Design Limited. This new technology will greatly improve overall graphical performance as well as provide support for advanced graphical features such as shadowing, more spectacular spell effects/animations, reflective surfaces, and much more.</B><p>Sound familiar? It will be interesting to see if Mythic can pull off yet another stable launch. And as apathetic as we are about DAoC in general, we do have to admit that the idea of shadows and reflective surfaces is very cool.<p>I wonder if we'll have to wait a year and a half to get them.
