On Friday, Gary &quot;Lady Daegarmo&quot; Grobson announced his/her <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum6/HTML/000967.html">departure</a>:<p><B>Fare well my friends,<p>Today was my last day at SOE. I wish all of the players the best of luck and hope that you continue to make EverQuest the strongest community of players ever to see the online world!</B><p>Grobson ran many events for Verant, most notably the various Tests of Tactics and Best of the Best competitions. There was a lengthy hiatus where Grobson was on different projects, but he ended up coming back to the job fairly recently. Now, he's gone for good.<p>All of this got us thinking about the many other departures in recent memory... Brad McQuaid, Kendrick, Kelly Flock, Jeff Butler. And then we thought, hey, you know who we haven't heard a peep out of in ages? Abashi. I mean, with all the recent balance and game changes, you'd think he'd be more visible. So we asked Absor what was up, and got this response:<p><B>Gordon is working for us on another project.  I'll let him know that you were worried about him, though.  :)<br>...<br>Everone that works here is 'associated' with EQ in one way or another.  But Gordon isn't on the EQ Live team, he's on another project.</B><p>So Abashi is no longer a member of the EQ Live team, and apparently hasn't been for a while. Which makes all the recent changes rather interesting, no?<p>Then, over at the Plane of Mischief board, Irontaail posted the following <a href="http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheplaneofmischieffrm12.showMessage?topicID=231.topic">rumor</a>:<p><B>Well I found out tonight that 15 ppl were let go at VI in the last 2 days ... the entire content team 8-(<p>That means the ppl that were working on PoM fixes (scheduled for 2 months) are all gone. VI is almost exclusively working on NEW CONTENT ONLY. Which means zones like POM are being left as is 8-(<p>Good news is that new content is the main focus of VI and as such LOTS of new things are scheduled, bad news is OLD stuf is pretty much dead as it stands now 8-( </B><p>Mobhunter immediately sent its network of informants and shadowy conspirators into action, and has been able to determine that Irontaail's information is at least partly inaccurate. There are, in fact, still people working on the old quests, though there may indeed be <I>less</I> of them.<p>If we get any further official word on this, we'll post an update.<p><BIG>Daylight Savings Fun</BIG><p>I don't know anybody who actually enjoys changing their clocks twice a year for Daylight Savings Time (makes me miss living in Arizona, actually), but this time around Verant must have <I>really</I> hated it, according to some folks at the Safehouse. It seems the time change early Sunday morning was causing some <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=23204.topic">interesting problems</a> to surface. Apparently you could die and come back fully clothed with all the items still on your corpse--which meant item and money duping. There may also have been some character rollbacks and lost items/exp, as the following message was spammed by a GM:<p><B>[Sun Apr 07 06:22:28 2002] <SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE> Lydrea : Hail Norrath!! If you find you have lost time, exp or items please contact your server GM by using the &quot;Contact your GM&quot; link at www.EverQuestLive.com. Sorry for any inconvenience.</B><p>I don't recall ever hearing of this phenomenon related to Daylight Savings Time before, and there have been at least six clock changes since EQ has gone live. This leads me to the conclusion that this whole fiasco was caused by some new code that Scott Hartsman has introduced--some secret Trojan horse that only he can defuse, thus guaranteeing his job security. And who can blame him these days? Rock on, Hartsman!<p><BIG>Down and Out in San Diego</BIG><p>Old news by now, but on Saturday we were treated to an unexpected downtime, courtesy of the San Diego power company:<p><B>Power issues in the San Diego area. Saturday, April 06 2002 07:28 PST <p>We are aware of power issues in the San Diego area, and are dealing with them as promptly as possible. Sorry for the inconvenience. <p>- The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>Which was followed by:<p><B>Power issues resolved. Saturday, April 06 2002 11:38 PST <p>The power issues in the San Diego area have been resolved. All servers are back online. Sorry for the inconvenience. <p>- The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>So it was like a bonus patch day in a week already chock full of patch days. In other words, that kind of sucked.<p>But then again, it occurs to me that the vast majority of EverQuest players probably don't give a crap about server outages or scheduled patches. Really, the only ones complaining are ubers who have to wait for their favorite megaspawn, and players of all levels who feel it violates the Constitution in some way if they don't have the ability to log in at any given moment. Given the litigious nature of our society, I'm always surprised there isn't a class action lawsuit brought against Verant every time a server goes down.<p>Boy, I bet the folks in San Diego will be real happy I brought up that notion...<p><BIG>Might Want to Stop Holding Your Breath</BIG><p>If you're one of those people anxiously awaiting the arrival of Shadowbane--you know, that game with the ultimate PvP angle that's going to bury EverQuest and all--you'll be <a href="http://shadowbane.ubisoft.com/home/news.shtml#news2">waiting a while longer</a>:<p><B>Although Ubi Soft and Wolfpack Studios originally announced that the game would launch in the first half of 2002, we have collectively determined that it will be in the best interests of the game if we extend the beta test for a few more months. Rather than rush the game out the door, Wolfpack Studios and Ubi Soft have decided that we will release the game &quot;when it is ready&quot;. <p>At this time we cannot commit to an exact date of the game's launch, but we are working as hard as possible with Wolfpack to release the game as fast as possible, but without compromising the level of quality of the game.</B><p>You know, we were expecting a flood of new MMORPGs at the end of 2001, and a lot of them won't be showing up until late 2002 at the earliest. Many just vanished into the mist--I still don't know what that whole Dawn fiasco was all about.<p>Despite the fact that we enjoy EverQuest tremendously, we are anxious to see what innovations new games can come up with. But somehow, given its obvious PvP/strategy focus, I don't think Shadowbane is going to be an EQ killer. More likely, it will develop a parallel market for folks who enjoy that angle, and EQ won't lose much ground. After all, you only have to look at the PvP/non-PvP ratio in EverQuest to see how many people enjoy getting PKed in newbie zones.
