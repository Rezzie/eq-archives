Seems you'll need your system to be a little more verile than originally anticipated.<p><B>Required Specs:<p>Windows&reg; 98/2000/ME/XP <br>Pentium&reg; II 400Mhz or greater <br>256 MB RAM <br>16 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&amp;L (i.e. Nvidia GeForce/GeForce 2) <br>DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card <br>28.8 K+ Internet connection <br>4X speed CD-ROM <br>450 MB+ hard drive space<p>Note: Although technically below the minimum specs, players with 128 MB of RAM will still be able to run Luclin by turning off the new character models. <p>Recommended Specs:<p>Windows&reg; 98/2000/ME/XP <br>Pentium&reg; III or greater <br>512 MB RAM <br>32 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&amp;L (i.e. Nvidia GeForce 2 or greater) <br>DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card <br>56.6 K+ Internet connection <br>16X speed CD-ROM <br>1.5 GB+ hard drive space<p>Note: DirectX 8.0 or greater is required. System requirements subject to change as the game progresses.</B><p>Those are some pretty hefty requirements, though I'd wager most EverQuest players can handle them. It's better to push the envelope than to play it safe, and in the long run Luclin will be all the better for it.<p>Also on the system requirements page are some before &amp; after screenshots that showcase the difference when using the new character models. Seeing these characters side by side with the old ones really shows off how far the models have come, and I have to wonder why anyone wouldn't want to use the new ones.<p>The pics demonstrating hardware T &amp; L (texture and lighting) are very impressive as well. While it's easy to get hung up on the character models, we shouldn't neglect the impressive scenery.<p>Don't forget to check out the other new <a href="http://www.everlore.com/#2">screenshots</a> that have been <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/screenshots2/default.asp?Category=4">making the rounds</a> on all kinds of sites. They're very impressive, to say the least.<p>Okay, that's all you get for tonight. Happy Thanksgiving to all of you. In a year with so many things to be thankful for, we at Mobhunter want to let you guys and gals know how grateful we are that you keep coming back to our goofy little EQ site.
