Apparently some folks on Cazic-Thule are attempting to become the third server on which Kerafyrm snaps out of his slumber and crashes a few zones.<p>What's the big deal? Well, when the Sleeper stops napping, his four warders don't spawn anymore. These dragons are the best source of primal weapons--often dropping four or more excellent weapons each. Yes, golem bosses drop primal as well, and they are said to respawn faster after the Sleeper goes away, but primal drop rates are arguably lower and there are a number of other nice items that don't enter the game except through the warders.<p>Obviously, many guilds don't want the fourth warder to die, because they want their shot at primal, too. Typically, it seems to work something like this: one or two strong guilds per server get enough keys to do Sleeper's Tomb, and they farm primal for a matter of months (the warders are one-week respawns). When these first guilds have lots of primal, they turn their attention to other targets, such as the north wing of Temple of Veeshan. Other guilds begin accumulating keys in the hopes of entering the Tomb to get their shot at primal.<p>Sooner or later, after the first couple guilds that had their way with ST for a while will be up for a new challenge--and the fourth warder is quite a challenge. They might also want the fame of being the ones on their server to accomplish this one-time-only feat. (Whether or not the Sleeper can be returned to his slumber and awakened again is unknown.) And, honestly, some might want to cut down the supply of primal weapons in order to maintain the mystique of owning them.<p>In any case, the debate as to whether waking the Sleeper is the &quot;right&quot; thing to do is a matter that will continue to be argued for some time. Rather than debate the quest itself, Brad McQuaid elected to discuss, in a general sense, what quests of this type mean to the future of gaming. Most of his lengthy response follows:<p><B>Our intent behind this encounter was/is to experiment with events that can only happen once. It's part of the slow but sure move towards dynamic game worlds we all want. The world IS supposed to be different after the Sleeper is awakened -- sure, there aren't drastic changes to zones or the world itself -- the technology and tools simply aren't there yet. <p>But it's a start. <p>Here are some approaches to content: <p>1. Totally re-usable -- basic MUD stuff. You can kill it over and over again -- maybe it will have loot, maybe there's a trophy system, etc. <p>2. Usable once per player (or group, or guild -- i.e. some subset of the playerbase) -- I see several games heading in this direction and it's very interesting. Essentially, you keep track of each player's accomplishments (probably not all of them, because, well, that's hard, but typically quests or at least major quests). <p>3. Big, one time, world 'changing' events, e.g. Waking the Sleeper. Over time, as technology and tools get better, and as budgets hopefully become larger, this evolves into very noticeable changes. Let's say some group of players trigger a volcanic eruption, changing the face of a mountain visually and permanently. Or let's say another group assassinates the Lord of a castle, shifting political power and such, thereby changing the population and makeup of the NPCs in that zone permanently (or, at least, until another significant event). <p>Ok, why are #2 and #3 dangerous and hard (yet still very appealing)? Well, the biggest challenge in making MMORPGs is creating the content (and by that I mean both creating the geometry and textures that make up a huge world, and also populating the zones with NPCs, treasure, quests, etc.) And so the danger is the old 'it takes 6 months to write a novel and 2 weeks to read it' problem, which is, of course, why MUDs have had re-usable content in them for years. <p>So when you're allocating resources to build an MMORPG world, the idea of content that would only be used once per player, or even once period, is a bit terrifying -- it just doesn't seem like a good use of the limited time and resources every product manager has. <p>But then we also feel that the vast majority of both consumers and developers WANT more dynamic worlds, and they want to at least have a chance to impact that world. So that's what we and many other developers are starting to experiment with, and specifically that's what Waking the Sleeper is all about. It's going to be a difficult and challenging path, but I think it's going to be worth it - we've GOT to move beyond hacking the same MOB over and over again. <p>Ok, I've attempted to explain the fears, concerns, and desires of the developer as it relates to creating use-once or use-less-than-infinitely content. What are the concerns of the player? <p>Well, this rant/story/whatever seems to indicate one of them: what if I'M not one of the people who got to 'change' the world? I missed the experience, and I also potentially missed the treasure/reward associated with changing the world. Is that bad, overall? <p>Which in a way leads me to a more general and long-term concern... I think the future of MMORPGs is very bright, and I think the budgets that make them happen will grow and grow. At least I hope they do, because I really on both a personal and professional level want to be involved with creating these huge, virtual worlds for a long time. So, eventually, I'd like to see worlds so large that one player couldn't experience it all himself. A world that intricate and deep is more intriguing for me -- more real - somewhere I could get lost in and escape - the closest thing we'll probably ever have to making the fantasy worlds we read about as kids come alive. <p>But how will many players react to this? I think a certain expectation exists that stems from playing single player games: I am the hero/protagonist/center of the universe and I have the fundamental right to consume all the content of this game and reach the pinnacle/highest level/finish the storyline/whatever. <p>Many of the complaints about MMORPGs in general and EQ specifically seem to relate to frustrations about not having enough time to accomplish certain things, that associations with larger guilds are necessary to acquire certain items, etc. And while I think this is a key component to EQ's success (the majority of players often experiencing extremely high level content vicariously, hoping one day to experience it first hand), I'm not blind to the fact that it also turns many other players off. <p>So, now, what happens in the future? What happens if worlds become so large there's no way even for the most time-rich uber-powergamer to experience it all? And what if, looping back to the original theme of this post and thread, events occur in said world that not only actually change it, but can only occur once? <p>Well, we'd have our dynamic, ever-changing, hardly-ever boring and repetitive world most all of us want... but we'd also have players with experiences and rewards that other, probably newer players, will never have... (makes me think back to when we removed Rubicite and how in a sense it became priceless because it would never spawn again). <p>Anyway, some food for thought perhaps... is it the wrong direction for these games? Are players just going to have to get used to how fundamentally different these games are and must become vs. single player games? Or is there another solution and/or direction these games should go? <p>-Brad</B><p>Still here? Well, if you started napping during that post, let me point you to the key issue.<p>Lots of people--roleplayers in particular--say they want dynamic content that changes the world of Norrath permanently. They point to the battle of Bloody Kithicor as a prime example of an in-game event that results in an interesting change in the world (undead spawning in Kithicor Woods at night, opening of the Plane of Hate).<p>Yet with the wakening of the Sleeper, we have an in-game event that results in a seemingly permanent change in the world that is, for the most part, unpopular. What's the difference?<p>Phat lewt, basically. Nobody hunted in Kithicor anyway, so the changes there only made things more interesting, aside from inconveniencing travelers a tad. But Sleeper's Tomb is the ultimate zone for farming weapons; priceless and primal drop like candy. Any guild capable of obtaining 24 keys to ST is capable of plowing through the first three warders. Each trip to the warders results in a whole lot of primal and other goodies, with relatively little risk.<p>Causing the Sleeper to awaken initiates some temporary changes to a few other zones--mostly the wipeout of all NPCs and players who happen to be there--but permanently changes Sleeper's Tomb itself. A change that is seen as negative by most everyone hoping to experience that zone in its original form and reap the rewards of being able to go there.<p>Which leads us back to one of Brad's points: the desire for both static and dynamic content.<p>As much as some people complain about camping named NPCs for items, just as many complain when such a mob is changed or removed. Some say they'd like to see the Freeport Milita overthrown by the Knights of Truth... but what happens to the paladins who haven't gotten Soulfire yet? While such a change to the world would unarguably be interesting, it would have implications to many quests.<p>The problem facing Verant in this case is essentially this: when a nice item makes its way to EQ'Lizer or AllaKhazam's, every player wants it... and what's more, they feel <B>entitled</B> to it. If Player A gets phat lewt, Player B wants it, too. Anything the prevents this from happening is the cause of much wailing and gnashing of teeth--specifically, claims that uberguilds get such items first and thus have an unfair advantage, or that Verant loves powergamers more.<p>Granted, EverQuest is largely a static game, and the argument can be made that since this fact is part of the game design itself, Verant shouldn't try to alter the very nature of the game--especially over two years into it. On the other hand, look at the incredible restriction this places on the EQ game designers. We're telling them that we want changes and exciting events to happen in the game, but only so long as it doesn't screw up anyone's shot at a certain quest or item.<p>Is there a right answer or a wrong answer to this debate? No. But be assured that Brad is right when he says that dynamic content is the future of the market, so you better get used to the idea. Because there may be worlds in the works where nobody is entitled to anything.<p>Kinda sounds like the real world, doesn't it?
