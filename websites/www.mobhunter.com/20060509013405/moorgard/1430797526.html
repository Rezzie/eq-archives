In order to get them to show up, you may need to set DoProperTinting=TRUE in your Eqclient.ini file.  You can do that by typing /dopropertinting in game.<p>ALSO NOTE:  We have changed a lot of UI Files.  Here's the list:<p>** UI File Changes **<p>EQUI.xml			 <br>EQUI_Animations.xml		 <br>EQUI_CharacterCreate.xml<br>EQUI_FacePick.xml<br>EQUI_NoteWindow.xml<br>EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml <br>window_pieces04.tga	<br>EQUI_JournalCatWnd.xml - NEW FILE<br>EQUI_JournalTextWnd.xml - NEW FILE<br>EQUI_JournalNPCWnd.xml - NEW FILE<br>EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml	- NEW FILE <p>** Interface and Gameplay **<p>- The melee button for Ulaks, Martial weapons and Two-Handed Piercing weapons should appear to be depressed when attacking.<br>- Increased the size of the Notes window in the new UI.<br>- /viewport fixed.<br>- Fixed bug where action and hot-buttons for innate abilities would revert to numbers (1-6) instead of their name when a skin was loaded using /loadskin. It now reloads the names too.<br>- Fixed a bug that could cause a client crash if too many full containers were open and the ALT key was pressed.<p>** Spells **<p>- Lowered the mana cost of Yaulp I, Yaulp II, Yaulp III, and Yaulp IV to increase the value of these spells<br>- Theft of Thought works properly now, it was draining all of the caster's mana, no matter who the target was.<br>- Damage over Time type Area of Effect spells will no longer do damage when player character resists the spell.<br>- All pet spells will now get focused from any pet focusing spell/item.  This means, for example, that summoning haste will work on Beastlord and Necromancer pets.<p>- Fixed a bug that caused pet health bar to disappear if when trying to charm when a pet already exists.<br>- Divine Barrier now does all of its healing in a single burst instead of as regeneration.<br>- Removed the erroneous message &quot;Returning to your own perspective&quot; that occurred when a character was changed into something using an illusion.<p>** Quests **<p>- Dillon the Drowned should now respond properly when hailed.<br>- Corrected a problem with a 'quest' for the hermit in South Karana.<br>- Animist Poren now gives the correct recipe for his Handwraps Quest (shadeling silk instead of shade silk).<br>- Noirin Khalen now gives out the proper jewelry book.<br>- Supreme Loachsmith Psorin now returns items that he does not need or want.<p>** Items **<p>- Removed Rogues from the list of classes on the Elegant Darkwood Katana, since it is a two-handed slashing weapon.<br>- Removed the &quot;secondary&quot; tag from the Flametongue, as this item is for Int. casters only and they can't equip this item in their secondary slot.<br>- The Nathsar Greatsword and Fester now have the proper inventory icon.<p>** Tradeskills **<p>- Added new potions for Vah Shir Shaman (and all other Shaman): Shadeweaver Portal.<br>- Renamed one of two items called Figwort.  The Figwort sold in Shar Vahl has been renamed Ground Figwort to reduce confusion.<br>- Renamed one of two items called Drachling Silk.  The Drachling Silk that was once no drop is now tradable and named Drachnid Silk.<br>- Adventurers have learned new techniques for fighting Cyclopes.  These great beasts are now much more likely to have their eye intact when killed.<br>- Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Soul of Incorporeal&quot; to use a &quot;feather&quot;.<br>- Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Troll's Essence&quot;.<br>- Fixed the cast time on any 5 and 10 dose potions that were inconsistent with their single dose versions.<br>- General Bragmur in Iceclad should now avoid ice flows that he was having a problem crossing in the past.<br>- Terrorantula Silk, Feather, branch of sylvan oak, branch of planar oak, Drachnid Silk, and Drachling Silk are now stackable.<br>- Silicorrosive Grease is now tradable and stackable.<br>- Potions Aquatic Haunt and Serpents Drink no longer require reagents.<br>- Grandmaster Alchemist will now have a way to prove their ability.<p>** Alternate Advancement **<p>- Extended Notes now works on area of Effect songs as well as group songs.<p>** PvP **<p>- Fixed a bug with Root and Snare spells that prevented the target player character from being affected until they zoned.<br>- Fixed a bug with mesmerization spells being unbreakable by normal means.<p>** Zones ** <p>- Fixed some text and grammar errors in Skyshrine.<br>- Ikurenm the Sly should no longer disappear when trying to chase his enemies.<br>- Repaired some &quot;safe spots&quot; in Echo Caverns, Paludal Caverns and Grieg's End.<br>- Fixed a pathing issue in Kurn's Tower that was causing some NPCs to disappear.<br>- The Golem Master in Charasis now looks like a golem.<br>- The Orc Arsonist will no longer have his torch disappear when looted (as long as he had it to begin with).<br>- The Sands of Fire event will now be restricted to the intended four groups.  Alternate methods of getting characters into the event have been removed.<br>- Corrected doors in Kaladim, Blackburrow and Erudin that opened the wrong way and one door in Kaesora that was way off its hinges.  Also, the Dwarves have installed a door in one of their guard huts to prevent drafts.<br>- Moved an oven in North Freeport that was poking through a ceiling.<br>- Wraith of a Shissar should no longer attack its compatriots, so they should no longer be killing it in retaliation.<br>- Corrected some respawn issues in the Plane of Air.<br>- Rallos Zek is much less likely to need to leave the arena in order to deal with his enemies...<p>** Miscellaneous **<p>- Changed &quot;wode&quot; to &quot;woad&quot; in the face picker.<br>- Corrected a spelling error in the text of the Purify Body ability (affect to effect).<br>- PCs under illusions should appear with hair if the race can have hair, even if the PC's race can't have hair.  Fixed a few other bugs with illusions and their effect on hair and eyes.<br>- Vah Shir will now see &quot;punches&quot; when punching instead of &quot;hits&quot;.</B><p>Honestly, the Dev Team is damned if they do and damned if they don't.<p>People clamor for bug fixes all the time. But they only really care about the bugs that affect them. For instance, every patch message <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=24635.topic">wizards complain</a> that the giant bane quest isn't fixed yet, <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=36687.topic">monks complain</a> that their mitigation wasn't fixed yet, etc. So when they see things like an oven sticking through a roof being fixed, they get cranky.<p>It's all relative, of course. Somewhere in the nearly half million people who play this game, <I>somebody</I> must be saying &quot;HOT DAMN!!! They FINALLY fixed the SK hermit! My life is now complete!&quot;<p>Well, maybe not, but hopefully you get my point.<p>Believe me, I want them to get around to those major issues as much as anybody does. But just keep in mind that all fixes--even the ones we see as minor--are good things. It shows that they are listening to all the people who voted for them to go back and fix broken stuff rather than just putting all their efforts into new content.<p>The vocal majority does have a few things to be pleased about, of course. <a href="http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=17692.topic">Paladins are happy</a> that the cost of their yaulp spells was fixed. Hopefully the Rallos Zek encounter is now <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=12801.topic">less sploitable</a>. Enchanters are giddy that an epic mob was <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=82929">finally fixed</a>.<p>And those of you who groan every time you see a change to the UI can take heart that the folks at EQ Interface are on top of it. <a href="http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=c7f0d13fb5a78a5497cd97b671d2b610&amp;threadid=6274">UI fixes</a> have already been posted, so as long as you are able to operate a simple text editor, you can get things working again.<p>Here's hoping that the servers are stable, and that Thursday's child ends up being warm and friendly.
