Also fixed a bug with the left selection arrow sometimes not changing hair color.<br>- Fixed the &quot;Entering Luclin&quot; message bug.  This was only an errant text message, it was not causing any crashes or keeping anyone out of the game.<br>- Fixed a bug where Vah Shir with an intelligence over a certain amount could not be created.<br>- Fixed a bug with faction-affecting items: They were giving a bonus to all factions instead of just the intended faction<br>- Fixed a problem with arrows and quivers that would result in the person being logged out.<br>- Adjusted the cost of Combine Platemail to be inline with its stats and other armor available within game.<br>- Made several gameplay changes to The Grey.  A single group having the ability to simultaneously engage and prevail against 35+ experience-giving creatures is not in line with the desire for risk vs. reward and the promotion of balanced groups.<br>- Removed some bad NPCs in Chardok.<br>- Tuned encounters in The Fungus Grove, Maiden's Eye, and Dawnshroud Peaks.<br>- Clarified some quest dialog in Sanctus Seru.<br>- Tuned The Deep, also improved the variety of drops.<br>- Improved pathing in The Temple of Ssraeshza<br>- Improved pathing in Sanctus Seru<br>- Improved pathing in Echo Caverns<br>- Added some newbie beastlord quests in the old world.<br>- Removed the &quot;Lore&quot; tag from the &quot;Darkened Knight's Bracer&quot;<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>Stemming off the <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">kneejerk reaction</a> to recent zone changes, Abashi came out of his den long enough to drop some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000427.html">knowledge</a> on us:<p><B>A number of the responses coming into the Dev Corner are along the lines of &quot;Why the knee-jerk reaction&quot;? <br>Frankly, when you have a situation that horribly breaks the game, trivializes advancement, and is public common knowledge, you have to act without delay. For instance, were a dupe bug to find its way into game and get posted all over the web, we'd immediately shut the servers down while we correct the situation. Some might consider that knee-jerk, but it's necessary for advancement in the game to mean something. <p>The situation with the Grey is basically the same type of thing, though not as severe of course. It had to be addressed first to ensure the integrity and longevity of the game. Sure, after that we can sit down and determine what the best way would be. You might want to see what changes go in (some tonight) before making final judgements.<p>-Gordon</B><p><a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=18906.topic">Reports</a> on some of the <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forumsnew/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=8652&amp;FORUM_ID=1&amp;CAT_ID=1&amp;Topic_Title=THE+BASTARDS+NERFED+FG+AGAIN&amp;Forum_Title=General+Discussions">zone changes</a> are already coming in, with lots of players unhappy that the unprecedented exp levels found in some Luclin zones are now in line with the rest of the world.<p>But ya know what? Abashi is right on. Scream all you want to about how you have the right to do what you want in this game, but it's time to grow up and realize that balance is necessary to keep the game fun. When someone figures out how to use a certain tactic to trivialize game content that 90% of the player base has to confront in the intended way, that problem needs to be addressed.<p>Another thing we just have to accept is that every time new content is added to the world, some powergamers will line up to take advantage of every weakness they can find. Whether it's some freak who gets 30+ AAS points in the first days of Luclin or a farmer who finds a safe spot from which to nuke without taking damage, the aforementioned powergamers will reap the rewards of finding these weaknesses in the game code. Verant finds out about these problems by watching the powergamers and proceeds to fix the problems they find. When regular players find out about the changes and realize they can't take the same easy route to exp and phat lewtz, they bitch and moan.<p>Get over it. Realize that it's a fact of life that you won't ever be able to change. This is the same way some people make a fortune in the real world: by finding legal loopholes and exploiting weaknesses in the current economic system. Is it fair? No, it sucks. But it's life, and whining about it isn't going to result in it going away.<p>Fungus Grove is an ugly and boring zone anyway. Look at it this way: now you have an excuse to go out and see the world.<p><BIG>It Could Always Be Worse</BIG><p>Hey, if you're still pissed off at Verant, be glad you aren't one of the 47 people who still play Asheron's Call, because then you'd <I>really</I> have a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-8147567.html">reason</a> to be mad. It seems that Microsoft has made another user-friendly move by making their Zone gaming page require the use of their Passport identification scheme. This is all part of their goofy .Net deal, a hub of their whole MSN plan for world domination (a.k.a. MS World Domination Plan #478201-J). Anyway, it seems the switch to this Passport deal made AC unavailable for a while or something.<p>Ho-hum, Microsoft beats up its customers yet again. But until a Linux version of EQ ships (in the year 3010), MS continues to have us by the short hairs.<p><BIG>See the Moon Rand McNally Style</BIG><p>Some new Luclin maps were posted at <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/">EQ Atlas</a> the other day, and as usual they are well done and extremely helpful. Muse can't be given enough credit for the work he's done to make Norrath--and now Luclin--a much easier place to get around in. If you're one of those who thinks a zone map is a spoiler, remind me not to go on any cross-country car trips with you.<p>While the EQ Atlas maps are fairly utilitarian in nature, those of you looking for the prettier variety will be pleased that <a href="http://www.nx.sakura.ne.jp/%7Echizuya/indexe.html">Norrath Map Shop</a> has also been updated. These are gorgeous maps, but unless you read Japanese you aren't going to understand all the details.<p><BIG>Mages Not Wanted Here</BIG><p>How can you make a caster feel like he's not wanted? Make it so his spells don't work in every zone.<p>The mages have <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=3088.topic&amp;start=21&amp;stop=27">discovered</a> that not all their new Luclin spells work in places like Kedge Keep, Fear, and Hate. While we already <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=2061694566">reported</a> that Call of the Hero was made unusable in some zones, having Luclin spells be broken in the old world surely seems like a bug.<p><BIG>One Week Later</BIG><p>So we've had Luclin over a week now, and while things are tons better than they were on the day of release, there is still a boatload of changes to be made. While Absor is keeping his own <a href="">list</a> of what needs to be fixed, I thought I'd supply my own suggestions:<p>- improve frame rates<br>- improve zoning times<br>- display Velious armors<br>- fix the armor tints<br>- randomize NPC hair color so they aren't all brown<br>- make it so I can recover from linkdeath without restarting<br>- add sitting animations for all races<br>- make the face/hair choices stick without jumping through hoops<p>By the way, here's what I've found as far as the best way to get your face/hair picks to stay constant:<p>1. Get near a zone line and take off your helmet.<br>2. Pick your face details. Even if only want to change one or two features, change <B>all</B> of them, cycling back to the ones you wanted to keep as-is. This is important.<br>3. Cross the zone line.<br>4. When you zone in, check your features. If they are the way you wanted them, put your helmet on and zone again. If not, repeat steps 2 &amp; 3.<br>5. Take off your helmet again and verify that your changes stuck.<p>This works for me on the first try pretty much every time, and as I mentioned before, I've made a <B>lot</B> of face changes.
