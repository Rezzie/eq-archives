<h1 class="article_title">Five Recommended Improvements to Prophecy of Ro</h1>
<p>by Loral on April 30, 2006</p>

<p>The release of Prophecy of Ro is now three months past. Many players focus their attention on the soon-to-come Progression Server. However, while many look to these two interesting glimpses into the future, the Prophecy of Ro lays unfulfilled. </p>

<p>Prophecy of Ro requires improvement. While some areas of this expansion have proved very popular such as Arcstone, the Spirit quests, the relic quests, and the Thurgadin monster missions; these features alone do not justify the cost of the expansion. This article outlines five areas for improvement in Prophecy of Ro.</p>

<p>1. Increase Spirit Mark drops.</p>

<p>The spirit marks, currently dropping only off of named mobs in Arcstone, help non-raiders increase their equipment to reach higher-end content such as the Depths of Darkhollow spell progression missions and the Omens of War Muramite Proving ground trials. Unfortunately, these marks only drop in Arcstone and drop rarely off of rare spawning named beasts. While it would be easy to increase the drop rate, instead SOE should add these drops to named creatures in Elddar, Relic, and Devastation to help bring players to these underused zones.</p>

<p>2. Improve Relic, Devastation, Elddar, and Stronghold of Rage.</p>

<p>Increasing loot rewards is only one factor in improving the usefulness of the Prophecy of Ro static zones. Currently only Arcstone sees a significant number of hunters. Devastation may see occasional groups for the saga skin mission, but with less frequency than Arcstone's spirit hunter missions. All four of these zones need to be improved to make them more huntable and more desirable. Increasing experience rewards, decreasing mob density, increasing random loot rewards, and decreasing mob damage output may help make these zones more desirable to those who purchased Prophecy of Ro.</p>

<p>3. Bridge the required-equipment gap between Dragons of Norrath and the Depths of Darkhollow and Muramite Proving Ground Trials.</p>

<p>There remains a constant wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth when it comes to discussions about the Creator mission in Dragons of Norrath. What these discussions often omit is that players spend a lot of time in content of this style. Creator offers nice rewards for a low investment of time. Rather than complain that creator is too easy, consider that many players want clear, consistent rewards for their time.</p>

<p>4. Scale more content to the level of difficulty and time investment of Creator. </p>

<p>Offer rewards that help single-group-equipped characters improve to the point where they can reasonably face the challenges of high-end spell-progression missions in Depths of Darkhollow, the Skylance missions in Prophecy of Ro, and the Muramite Proving Ground trials in Omens of War. Help bridge the required equipment gap between lower-powered Arcstone and Dragons of Norrath content and the higher-end single group content in Depths of Darkhollow and Prophecy of Ro.</p>

<p>5. Add more Spirit Hunter style missions.</p>

<p>Arcstone added five more "single-group raid" encounters to Everquest along with the Seeker event in Depths of Darkhollow. These events show single-group hunters the style of encounters that high-end raiders have seen for years. These events are fun, challenging, and rewarding. A great many players are able to face them, defeat them, and earn nice rewards for doing so.</p>

<p>Add more events of this nature to Prophecy of Ro. Add a series of legacy creatures to the new Desert of Ro including a Lich to the spectre tower, an ancient ancestor of Lockjaw, an ancient mummy lord, a sand giant lord, and the swashbuckler king of the waterboys. Add in a new quest to reward those willing to face these five new foes.</p>

<p>Prophecy of Ro has the potential to pull players out of instanced single-group content and back into large static zones. As it stands, however, Prophecy of Ro needs improvement in order to match the excellent content found in older expansions such as Depths of Darkhollow and Omens of War. With these five improvements discussed above, Prophecy of Ro could become one of the greatest of Everquest expansions.</p>

<p>Lets go back to talking about the Progression Server instead of the expansion of the month. Look at the bright side, it'll take at least 2 years for the new server to catch up to where current day eq is. Who knows, maybe all the bugs will be fixed by then.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;ezez&#64;ez&#46;com">ezez</a> on May  1, 2006 04:31 AM</strong></p>
<p>Maybe you'll take a more cynical eye to the trash press releases and revolutionary game features the marketing staff puts out in the future.</p>

<p>Prophecy of Ro is a joke. There's a faction of EQ loyalists who actually love it (and to be honest Loral, I'm quite surpised you're not rabidly defending this insult of an expansion) </p>

<p>All new ways to revolutionize combat! Control spheres of influence! Use traps and auras, interact with destructable objects. What a complete joke.</p>

<p>Features aside, everything has thus far been a let down. Arcstone was certainly a neat concept, but I'm concerned it works only on the merit that it's the only zone of its kind - release four or five of them at once and you'll likely see a repeat of DoDH missions simply in uninstanced zones.</p>

<p>Let's talk about the theater of blood - I'm one of the people this zone is designed for, people not in hardcore raid guilds but with enough gear to take 2 groups to the zone and get armor. zZz zZz zZz - We've done it, we've spent hours clearing it. This zone is *nothing* like plane of fear nor does it bring back those memories. It's an absolute bore that out of 100 members in my guild only 9 people have completed key. Bravo!</p>

<p>What a joke.</p>

<p>I personally think por would make a bigger splash if they did the following</p>

<p>1. Make some more instanced zones that take advantage of the new descructible envrioment stuff. create instances where you need to destroy stuff (flags, doors, walls, trebuchts). perhaps even repair stuff?..</p>

<p>2. create more auras.. I have only seen the aura around Arcstone two maybe three times and that was not enough in my opinion. and create more distinction as to weather or not the aura is good or bad for you also let the aura effect a greater range. as it is now the aura storm could pass over you and disappear before you even use a spell.</p>

<p>3. Rework Elddar forest, half the time I have been there I have not seen anyone. I think the mobs hit just a little too hard. while some of them should be hard hitters. there are some mobs there that undercons.</p>

<p>4. more horses please.. please put more horses in the Ruins of Takish hiz.. perhaps even putting a occasional horse or two in the deserts of ro.</p>

<p>Why would they add or fix PoR when they could just take these requests and put them into the next expansion. In order words, don't hold your breath for free or upgraded content.</p>

<p>My biggest regret was that I bought DoDh for three accounts. That was a waste of money. I quit a month after and it's no surprise to me that PoR is a disaster. DoDh was a disaster.  Whoever designs these zones needs to be fired.  Yes, there were some good things but the overall expansion ends up being a waste of dollars and time invested.  </p>

<p>I'm undecided on returning for the Progression server because I doubt I would be in any way involved in the actual progression. So, I'd just be playing catch up with zones unlocking faster than I can gear/quest in the previous one. </p>

<p>I am waiting on more details of the next expansion as well.  If they make the new 1-75 zones interesting and rewarding, I may start a new toon that way instead. Things like appropriate gear progression and spell availabilty will be important though. </p>

<p>EQ was and is still a fun game but SOE really drops the ball repeatly. You can either rail against them or just go with the flow and enjoy what they give you. My EQ break was much needed but they might yet suck me back in. This time however, I will be in with my eyes open.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;ezez&#64;ez&#46;com">ezez</a> on May  1, 2006 02:40 PM</strong></p>
<p>I too made the mistake of getting 3 accounts DoDH.</p>

<p>Fortunately for SoE, only one account bought PoR (and that's all that will buy it.) For that matter, since they won't offer the $99 a year fee, I closed out my two extra accounts. Best decision I made as I realized I really didn't need to be multi-boxing anymore.</p>

<p>Ironically, the game is more enjoyable not multi-boxing as I had been doing - but hell if you can find stuff to do outside of your guild.</p>

<p>What bothers me is the focus of the dev team is purely on the progression server in terms of their public contact. Past issues? Unresolved bugs? Sorry, the developers are brain storming the progression server.</p>

<p>SoE's biggest mistake has been and continues to be its neglect of its 'current' (depending on if this was now or 4 years ago) core membership - they neglect it in pursuit of another group of players that are a minority as their core bleeds off.</p>

<p>I won't be pre-ordering the next expansion either after this mess, it'll be the first time I sit it out and wait before buying.</p>

<p>you people are all wrong. the eq development team accomplished exactly what they wanted to do. they raised the bar for the elite. all that monster mission, shrouds, war horse,metal boar, spirit cloak , instant zone missions, is all crap. its smoke and mirriors to get casual or new players to buy the expansions so the eq devs can fund high end raid encounters and make high end raid gear . thats what they spend the most effort into. they are making content for themselves (becuase the devs themselves are in uber guilds).this is also why expansions arent finished when they are sold. when people run out and buy the expansions then they have more money to put into finishing the expansion. hence forth all the patches. does this work? no! if it did then eq would have millions of customers rather then 400k or less.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;wiggles&#64;wiggles&#46;com">Wiggles</a> on May  2, 2006 07:51 AM</strong></p>
<p>That doesn't make a lot of sense. The problem with most expansions is the high end content is either unfished or not properly tuned.  If the devs were only focused on high end raids because they love the phat lewtz so much, why is this the case?</p>

<p>Let's take a look at high end raids. This is a fairly accurate recording of progression although some guilds do no participate in it.</p>

<p>GoD - 122 of 233 guilds beat GoD (161 made it to Tacvi) all because of the level increase to 70<br />
OoW - 23/235 beat OoW (123 cleared to Mata)<br />
DoN - 90/235 guilds recorded beat DoN<br />
DoDH - 7/235 beat DoDh<br />
PoR - 0/235 beat PoR. 3 have beat Sullon, only 26 have beat the first raid.</p>

<p>DoDH had around 1/400th of the EQ population even come close to beating it. 7 out of 235 recorded guilds beat the expansion.  Now a lot of people getting those phat drops. This was a failed expansion by any measure.</p>

<p>Hardly anyone has made a dint in PoR raids and how long has it been out? Another failed expansion. Well, it won't matter because the next expansion will be released and everyone will drop it in favor of the bigger carrot. </p>

<p>You can see the steady decline of completion. Many of the top end players really don't have the desire like they did during Luclin/PoP. #1 reason people still play EQ - "All the time invested in my character". Not that it's fun to raid these zones, but they can't let go and start over in another game.  That's why I wonder just how much Vanguard will really impact EQ. These people just won't let go of 5-7 years of playing a single game.</p>

<p>yeah exactly, trying to keep people elite. making it were fewer can get to " the top". why make it like that? what and who is to benefit?<br />
  i notice alot of people still talk about eq like it is a force to be reckon with in the gamming world. the people talking like this seem to be the ones still caught up in it. i just cant understand this. times have changed.the market has changed. eq subscriptions cant compete with other games. remember when WoW came out alot of people online were saying it didnt have a chance against eq. well look at it now. subscriptions in the millions.i think vanguard is gonna be BIG.i have played some of the current beta and all i can say is get ready. eq cant even dream of those numbers. what do you think is more likely to happen? eq getting millions of subscribers or dieing in a couple of years?  </p>

<p>"GoD - 122 of 233 guilds beat GoD (161 made it to Tacvi) all because of the level increase to 70"</p>

<p>Presumably, the level increase in the next expansion will allow the majority of those 235 guilds to beat targets in OoW, DoN, DoDh, and PoR that were previously unattainable, just as happened with Tacvi.</p>

<p>Well, isn't that just top notch thinking by SOE. Increase the level cap so you can finish 2 year old content.  Perhaps people want, and should be able to, complete the expansion as it was intended when it was bought?<br />

<p>and yet I wouldnt doubt that your one of the people who say that soloers should be happy with 4 year old content.. *whistles and walks off*</p>

<p>No, I'm one of the people who thinks EQ should be a raid focused game because it has shown it can really have some interesting events. They've shown time and again this isn't a soloers game and I accept that. Shrouds and MM make baby jebus cry.</p>

<p>However, when they can't even properly implement the raids, people have to question what exactly was the point. What was the point? Empty zones, impossible to beat raids, and whatever else Loral piped up about.  Shameful, really.</p>

<p>DoN was alright, although I'm no fan of farming Creator, I certainly enjoyed finishing all the event/missions there and being able to augment my gear. DoDH and PoR are two big whiffs though by any account.<br />

<p>Wow! i actually like DoDh and PoR. No clue what the problem is from above posters..hah! it seems like one of them is annoyed that the raiding content is too hard? that is fine, but i would ask, too hard for who? only reason im not at high end por is playtime, thats all. The actual events ain't too hard, they are challenging, and we get each event we come ot eventually and have a blast doing it.</p>

<p>No clue on PoR/DoDh being worth the money etc..but for raiding, i think EQ is spot on. So what if mayong only dropped by 7? it is damn highend raid, ill get him one day and be happy beating him. </p>

<p>I think they should get rid of Raiding alltogether and let the raiders go on to other games that are comming out. Casuals are the majority anyway!</p>

<p>Naw leave raiding in the game. We hear all the time how it is so fun, then just remove any xp / loot rewards from it. If it is so damn fun then the raiders will continue to do it even though it provides no reward to them.</p>

<p>Lets see their feelings if that was to happen, they would scream louder about that then they whine about solo / casual players.</p>

<p>"seems like one of them is annoyed that the raiding content is too hard? that is fine, but i would ask, too hard for who?"</p>

<p>Well, looking at the numbers, I'd say too hard for 80% of the EQ paying customer base. The 20% that do use it must thank the 80% who help fund it for them.</p>

<p>Most expansions contain a very larger percentage of raid content and lately, fewer and fewer people are bothering with it. Either because it's too hard or they just don't care. SOE needs to figure out what is their goal.</p>

<p>I disagree. Since mergers took place the nice friendly atosmpheir on my server has hit the seweres. It is almost unheard of to get a group and traveling to arcstone as a single is a non start. Often you can sit in arcstone and see 15 people in zone, shout lfg and nothing. I have often traveled to watch and there are 3 groups of 5. Peeps refuse to let most in. If you want to help alot of us make some stuff for solo, like the LDON was suppose to have but failed to have.</p>

<p> I dont know how every one else feels but I for one am very tired of zones that require navigating paths that are way high up in the air.  The slightest bit of lag and a nasty corpse run or back to the guild lobby for a stone.  Man but I hate all that only being able to navigate a zone by flying.</p>

<p>  I am not really too pleased with much of the DoDH expansion.  The graphics are nice but the game play for me has proved to be very undesirable.  The mobs hit like trains from the highest end fights and See invis mobs are all over the place.</p>

<p>  I really liked the DoN expansion though.  I had a lot of fun there, we killed a lot of the dragons and we even managed to finally take down the end mob.  The only thing I regretted about DoN was that I didnt buy it for a while because I wanted to see if it was any good.</p>

<p>  PoR has not really gotten hold of me either.  Once again zones are not easily accessable and I sure dont like the runnining on paths 1 meter wide and 500 meters above the ground.  The whole idea that a mob can knock you off the platform and into oblivion ( which is a great game, maybe it was good I got sent there ) just gets tiring.</p>

<p>  lately when I think about EQ I find myself letting out a sigh and thinking to myself that there is one more PITA flagging process to go through and again I am well and truly tired of all the zone flagging.  It kills guilds and puts expansions on the back of the raid guilds who must over and over again run back flagging just to keep a supply of fresh blood coming in.</p>

<p>  Is there no way to do an expansion that does not require flagging?  Can we not just get an expansion that we can all play and hopefully enjoy?  I dont mind the zones being tough but I am so tired of the flagging processes.</p>

<p>I see lots of posts on how bad POR/DoD were but nothing to say how it should be put right. Such negativity means that you are not here to help put things right and/or are considering leaving the game.</p>

<p>DoD group drops offered non raiders extremely good armour upgrades from instanced drops (IMO).</p>

<p>The slipgear aug offered an alternative to folks not wanting to back track through LDON stuff.</p>

<p>The overarching mask quest offered a very good Mask that in my opinion hard enough to be a challenge, and not excessively difficult as to be a frustration.</p>

<p>PoR, I have no problems traversing the zones, in arcstone there are a number of see invises, but theres a great big mountain range in the middle that if you hug you can get around the zone without much trouble.</p>

<p>The various quests offering, augs, rings and the fantastic cloak upgrade.</p>

<p>My main niggles on DoD are that the upgrades somewhat trivialised some raiding content I am still active with and that instanced drops were better than open content zones.</p>

<p>With PoR there seems to be a lot of drops from the instanced spell missions that have a load of hit points but little ac.</p>

<p>Heres my combined requests for changes for both PoR and DoD.</p>

<p>1.	Provide other camps for Belfast Faction and Gnomish Clockwork bolts/Mechanotablests. These are needed to make the POR uber type 12 augs but once a pharmer or dedicated guild get there, its locked for weeks.<br />
2.	The itemisation in Dreadspire keep is awful, please add some drops that balances RvR.<br />
3.	In Arcstone the drop rate of the spirit marks is not only too rare but certain more desirable marks are all concentrated in one camp. Up the chance of a drop and make all mark dropping named able to drop any mark, the chest/legs being the rarest (but hopefully not as rare as now). <br />
4.	The PoR instanced missions now lock so that people cannot be swapped in to loot the win at the end. I understand why this was done, however some of the drops from the mission are too class specialised and again, the gear required to do the missions exceeds some of the drops. RvR is out of whack here again.<br />

I beleive all the clockworks in the zone can drop Bolts/Tablets just need to not care about takeing the small faction hit. and I think there is even a instance with clockworks you can kill in for these peices.</p>

I would be happy if perhaps they could relook at the loot from instances and make some of the loots attuneable. because right now there are some loots from instances that would not be touched because it wouldnt be a upgrade for the people doing the mission.</p>

<p>ezez,</p>

<p>Mark me down as another who was disappointed SOE discontinued their special $99 annual fee.  What really bothered me about that whole thing was the fact that they had promised to automatically renew accounts at the same price when the deal was offered last year.  In other words, I signed up a number of accounts not only for the reduced rate but also for a price guarantee that SOE now refuses to honor.</p>

<p>The extra $50 per account isn't going to break me, but it was another disappointment piled upon many others and in the end it was reason enough for me to allow all my accounts to expire and leave the game.  I've tried to post about this on EQ Forums, but have found that I can't log in any more - I suspect this is because my accounts are now inactive.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I haven't missed EQ all that much over the past month or so.  Obviously, I still enjoy reading about the state of the game but I doubt I'll ever play it again.  SOE has been pretty nearsighted about this - they had in me a casual weekend multiboxer who consumed very few resources yet was willing to commit to annual renewals of 3 accounts.  No more.<br />

<p>Regarding Vanguard.  I had posted in another thread here that I was unsure of Vanguard's ability to be popular.  Having went to the site again, and then learning Microsoft was going to publish, since that thread has closed and it was brought up here, I wanted to say that as a game it does look like it has legs.  Microsoft publishing it would have made it transition from not well known to having Microsoft muscle behind it, the same as Blizzard did for WoW.  </p>

<p>However, with this new information, it's a moot point.  From what I read, anyone with the station access, which did go up btw, will be able to play this game.  So, those curious should be able to purchase it, give it a shot with station access, and if they enjoy it a lot more than EQ, just switch their subscription plan.  </p>

<p>Unless SoE tinkers with the inner workings of the game, all those Vanguard fans now have an easier transition to look forward too, or even the chance to play both games.  Heck, I might even give it a try (not really, I'm still pretty consumed by EQ right now).  It does look like a sweet game though graphically.  Maybe I will try it.....ack, like I have any time now:)  But for those looking forward to this title, I hope this represents good news.</p>

<p>If you're an SOE hater, recognize that Microsoft is even more likely to interfere with the direction and production of a game than SOE.  It sounds like one of the reasons Sigil is moving is they want to find a home where they can create the game THEY want to create without too much interference from management types.  I wish them good luck in this.  Good MMOs being produced only raises the bar for everyone, and I like a high bar:)</p>

<p>I get the feeling that MS probably was pressuring them to make it xbox 360 compatible. I can't see any way else they could interfere since it's already a Windows platform game.  Possibly another pressure point could of been release time. MS would want it out regardless if its ready and Sigil probably is willing to wait another year to fix it up.</p>

<p>Sigil bought themselves out then was left with not much choice but to find another publisher. <br />
