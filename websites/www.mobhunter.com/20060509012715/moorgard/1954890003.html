Lives have been both enriched and ruined; players have been entertained and driven to overindulgence; friendships have been forged and marriages have been broken apart. That's quite a resume for a computer game to have, yet somehow a digital world dreamed up by guys with names like Aradune and Smed has taken on a life of its own, and inspired both the best and worst from the half-million or so people who have played it.<p>I'd be a liar if I said I hadn't been touched by the game, and I've run the whole gamut of human emotions while playing it. I've laughed aloud at jokes told by the friends that I've made. I've been driven to fist-pounding anger by the actions of selfish and honorless individuals. And I've been moved by acts of kindness and charity made by some of the most noble people with whom I've ever communicated. Heck, my friends and I have even been inspired to make this Web site as a shrine of sorts to our &quot;other life&quot; that exists in Norrath.<p>Ultimately, EQ is still just a game that we play for fun. It amazes me that there are some people who run EverQuest sites who rarely if ever play the game anymore, keeping their sites up solely as a means of generating a little extra cash (a very little, these days). I still get a thrill out of killing a new mob or even reading about someone else doing it for the first time. To those of us at Mobhunter, it really is all about the game, and I'm happy to say we still have a lot of fun playing it.<p>For all of the above reasons, tonight feels rather solemn, and the moment seems to merit some time spent upon reflection. See, we've come to know our characters pretty well over the last 2-3 years. We've seen their outfits and armaments change, which of course is one of the greatest senses of pride and fulfillment that the game provides. Knowing that tomorrow (or whenever you manage to get Luclin installed) the world will look significantly different inspires feelings of both hesitation and wonder.<p>Nowhere is this felt more profoundly than with our characters. These avatars represent us in the microcosm of society that is our server, and the way our characters look is the way we appear to those we meet in game.<p>The other day I was chatting with a friend of mine about how much of us--our real personalities--is found within our characters. My friend told me that her character <I>is</I> her; when you speak to her avatar, you get the real person.<p>I take something of a different approach. While there is certainly a lot of me in Moorgard, he is also a personality of his own. I liken the relationship to that of a character in a novel. Writers can't help but put a lot of themselves into their creations--this is what helps make the characters seem realistic and alive. But a well-written literary character is also separate from the author, with different knowledge, beliefs, and motivations.<p>Moorgard has existed, in one form or another, since the days of Ultima III, and he ventured with me up through Ultima Online and finally into EverQuest. That's a long time to be in someone's skin, so it makes me a bit hesitant to know that when I next log into the game, Moorgard's familar face and armor is going to look very different.<p>I can forgive server outages and lag. I can ignore broken quests and nerfed loot. But what I don't think I could take is having Moorgard--my companion of so many years--suddenly look like a goofball.<p>Based on the screenshots we've seen lately, I don't think that's going to happen. But if I have one actual concern about the expansion, it's for my alter-ego to look cool (and maybe he wants this too, if you'll forgive the momentary schizophrenia). I'm sure many players feel the same way, which is why I can sympathize with the ogres and trolls who don't like the new models and want their appearances to stay as they have been.<p>Sure, EverQuest is just a game. But it has been a part of our lives for nearly three years now--more, in some cases. That isn't a trivial amount of time in the the span of a human life, and perhaps if we were all a bit more aware of that, we'd be putting a little more effort into making the lives of those around us in the game a little better.<p>Okay, enough reflection. Time for a little electro-shock therapy and a good night's sleep. I have a feeling tomorrow is going to be a long day.<p>See you on the moon.
