(this time we mean it)<br>- Made Rune Encrusted Short Sword rentable (was No Rent, should not have been)<br>- Fixed Shadowscream and all related recipes so that they return the correct mallet<br>- Reduced the price of the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk and Cloudy Stone of Veeshan<br>- Reduced the price of the first two keys for the Plane of Air<br>- Coterie Mask of the Dead has been retroactively changed to have 5 charges as originally intended<br>- Gauntlets of the Blood Fiend - Warrior has been removed from the wearable classes<br>- Shiny Trinket of Speed - An appropriate level of haste has been added to this item<p>** Interface **<p>- Added /tgb as a short version of /targetgroupbuff<p>- /shownames now works with the following parameters:<br>    no parameter = display the current setting.<br>    off = don't show player names over their heads<br>    1 = show only first names of players<br>    2 = show First and Last Name<br>    3 = show First, Last, and Guild (if any)<br>    4 = show Title (if any), First, Last, and Guild (if any)<p>Also, the LFG, AFK and LD tags will always show if names are not off.  There will no longer be brackets around them, and LFG will now appear at the end of the name with the AFK and LD tags (instead of being a * at the beginning)<p>- A player character will always have a name over its head, even if they are skeletons (unless /shownames is off), with the exception of some rare cases when players are turned into certain NPCs <br>-  Added /ttell.  This will send a tell to the player character that is currently your target.  The command will also allow corpses as a valid target.  /ttell'ing a player's corpse will auto-tell that player (this was actually patched earlier along with an emergency patch)<br>- Added IRC style '/me' as a synonym for /emote (this was actually patched earlier along with an emergency patch)<br>- Added '/send' as a synonym for /tell (this was actually patched earlier along with an emergency patch)<p>** Spells **<p>- Necromancer Group spells should now be working, they were only affecting the caster.  This includes spells such as: Degeneration, Succession of Shadows, Crippling Claudication, and Zavfeer's Theft of Vitae.  These spells have also had their duration increased.

This has the net effect of reducing the time between portal activations<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>That's a lot to chew on. Let's break it down a bit.<p>There is a lot of cool stuff in this patch. New social emotes are always nice (though fixing some basic character animations would be more appreciated). Repairing broken spells is always good. Reducing the cost of Hate and Sky transport stones is cool. Reducing port times to Luclin gets a big thumbs up. Having the casters of buffs not appear on  your target is a welcome change--one less reason to hate bards, at least. Casters should be pleased that flowing thought items now stack, and that some skills have been fixed. Most players should find something to be happy about in this patch.<p>Personally, I love the new /shownames filter. Why? Because titles are stupid. Giving the title of &quot;Baron(ess)&quot; after six skill points are earned is like giving every citizen of the world one million dollars--the only effect is to devalue what you give away. I bet 80% of level 60 players have a title. Besides that, &quot;Baron(ess)&quot; is just stupid. I was praying for a way to turn my title off, and I'm glad to finally have it.<p>Okay, onto the nerfs.<p>Probably the one that will get the most complaints is changing the Mask of the Dead from having unlimited charges to only having five. Many <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shadowknight/showthread.php?s=a85cd3b4970c781a065240e5dc2b4fc0&amp;threadid=11756">shadowknights</a> and <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forumsnew/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=9176&amp;FORUM_ID=1&amp;CAT_ID=1&amp;Topic_Title=FD+Mask+nerfed%2E+Verant+Bastards&amp;Forum_Title=General+Discussions">necromancers</a> have already reacted. For a bit of background, this is a quest mask that casts Feign Death. While necros and SKs already get this ability through spells, many liked the extra convenience of having something to fall back on should their first attempt fail.<p>Retroactive nerfs suck, and Verant does try to avoid them. But really, having unlimited charges of feign death available via a relatively easy quest is a bit unbalancing. Oh sure, here comes the outcry: &quot;You're a monk, so of course you'd say that!&quot; Well, yeah. While monks have FD as a skill, shadowknights get a superior ability via spells--plus their Kunark class legs cast Feign Death, too. Anyway, the world hasn't ended, but some complaining is justified. Enjoy yourselves.<p>Inspiring noticably less <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shadowknight/showthread.php?s=a85cd3b4970c781a065240e5dc2b4fc0&amp;threadid=11754">concern</a> is the change to the Gauntlets of the Blood Fiend. These babies gave warriors a 72-point lifetap, which necros and SKs weren't very happy about. Hmm, I guess this isn't <I>quite</I> a double standard, but it's close enough to call them on it.<p>As for the horses, we knew this change <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-289594857">was coming</a>, but we didn't know it would be in this patch. Medding in combat on horseback was so clearly an unintended side effect of steed ownership that I am loathe to comment any further on it. If you're pissed about this one, you should have seen the writing on the wall.<p>Making levitation spells not work in The Deep is a bit of a headache for guilds who liked to kill the Thought Horror Overfiend--the big old boss of the zone. See, there's a huge chasm there with a bridge that, uh, isn't exactly what it appears, so levitate/DMF was quite handy. Rumors of a workaround are already surfacing, however.<p>Regarding Call of the Hero and Eye of Zomm not working in Ssra Temple, well, that's no big surprise. Both these spells provide the means to circumvent certain content present in that zone (notice how artfully spoiler-free this paragraph is!) which Verant wants us to have the--uh--pleasure of experiencing. Besides, CotH was already iffy in Luclin, so I guess we're just used to it now.<p>If Verant really wants to see the Plane of Sky used, how about un-nerfing CotH and levitate there? It could turn two or three days of torture into an interesting one-day affair.<p>Nah. It would take more than that to make Sky a desirable place to go. Like, say, items that are actually worth the trouble.<p>Anyway, go experience the wonder of patch day and report back what you find.
