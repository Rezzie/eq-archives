Even when they're bad, at least they're interesting. And the patch messages we've seen on the Test server over the past couple days have been downright compelling. Compelling enough, in fact, to inspire me to log on to Test and actually make a character and have a look around. Anyway, here's the most recent patch message from the Test server:<p><B>** Sunday March 17, 4:00am. <p>- Magicians: Please check for new spell scrolls, available for testing in the Bazaar.  <p>- Everyone else: Magicians can summon focus items!  <p><I>(Note: Just to clarify - This does *not* mean that focus Items are Mage-Summonable-Only forever, nor are these the only kinds that will be out there.  These spells will be one of many ways they enter the world.)</I><p>- Cleaned up riposte code.  Everything should still riposte as it always has, except for:<p>- Pets are now more likely to avoid NPC ripostes.  (Including Flaming Sword/Rage/Hammer type pets.)<p>- Condensed some of the Buff Duration AA code.  Please keep an eye out for general weirdness with Buff Duration AAs.<p>- *As an experiment*  Wizards have an inherent chance to score a critical blast after 11, modeled after Warrior inherent criticals.  (This  critical shouldn't impact/devalue/adversely effect existing AA crit skills.)<p>- Moved chat commands around to preserve /L = /loc.  (Oops.  Sorry about that one.)<p>- Changed /filter to let you toggle all the chat filters as well as bad words.<p>- Changed /channel to let you set your default channel.<p>- Added a /dopropertinting command to set the &quot;DoProperTinting&quot; option in the INI file. <p>- Many fixes and tweaks to /hitsmode.<p>- The EverQuest Development Te...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</B><p>Poor sleepy Dev team!<p>Yes, focus items can be summoned by mages via spells. This may very well just be a way to get them into the general population for testing purposes, as witnessed by the warning message we placed in italics.<p>Mages are <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=4254.topic">discussing</a> the new items already, of course. Comments range from being quite pleased to &quot;oh great, more pez for us to summon.&quot; Gosh, poor mages, having the ability to summon even <I>more</I> useful items that could potentially have a major impact on any raid. The items that are available so far:<p><B>Tavees linen mantle (shoulder): 3ac, 5hp, 5mana, effect: tavees lesser diuturnty (worn)<p>Jedah's silver choker (neck): 5ac, 1hp, 1mana effect: jedah's conservation (worn)- recommended level 20 (note ac is actually 1 (5) when worn at level 1)<p>Jolum's tarnished bauble (ear): 2ac, 1hp, 1mana, effect: jolum's minor abatement(worn)- recommended level 8<p>Gallenites jade bracelet (wrist): 4ac, 1hp, 1mana, effect: gallenites minor destruction(worn)- recommended level 15<p>Naki's tiny ring (finger): 2ac, 1hp, 1mana, effect: naki's lesser pernicity (worn)-recommended level 12</B><p>And what exactly do these items do?<p><B>These have lesser, normal, and greater effect versions of : <p>Conservation (mana cost reduction?) <br>Diuturnity (spell duration) <br>Destruction (nuking damage) <br>Pernicity (spell casting haste) <br>Abatement (lower aggro?)</B><p>The other really interesting thing in the patch is an innate ability for wizards to do critical spell damage after level 11. This is an interesting parallel with the critical hits that warriors get, and we'll be curious if this makes it live or not. Thank goodness those crit filters are going in.<p><BIG>Exploring Test: One Kitty's Story</BIG><p>As I mentioned above, I made a character on Test to have a look at some of the recent changes. Since I wanted to try out the radial flora, I made a kittycat beastlord and had him take a peek at Shadeweaver's Thicket. Thus, the sexy Moorkatt made his dramatic debut.<p>Moorkatt killed a few white-conning mobs with his trusty newbie dagger, and ended up getting a yellow bubble each. Five kills later, I dinged to level 2. I thought maybe the frantic pace would continue, but those same mobs (blue now) netted me only one blue bubble each at level 2. Hmm, that's no fun... I'd have to kill like 25 mobs to ding again. So I tried some white con called &quot;A Nuisance.&quot;<p>Bad mistake. They proc some 7-point DD spell that soon had me running for the guards (and not making it--thx lazy guards!). Where's an orc pawn when you need one? And maybe taking only five kills to get through level 1 wasn't such a great idea, because my Offense skill was like 1 and I think Piercing got to 2. If levelling to 10 is really that much easier, Verant better adjust skill gains accordingly at those levels, or else players will run into severe skill gaps.<p>Having already given up on becoming a mighty beastlord with epic (yeah, the beastlord epic was found--ho-hum), I decided instead to play with the radial flora and get a couple screenshots for you. Click the thumbnails:<p><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="5"><TR><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/kattng.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/kattngt.jpg"></a></TD><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/kattwg.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/kattwgt.jpg"></a></TD></TR><TR><TD>Radial flora off</TD><TD>Radial flora on</TD></TR></TABLE><p>Those shots aren't the best (actually, they're really good of Moorkatt), but you can see how having radial flora on makes little grasses and shrubs pop up as you move. Overall, it adds to the reality of the landscape--something those outdoor Luclin zones desperately need. The radial flora didn't seem to be as dramatic as when we first saw it demoed back at Minneapolis FanFaire, but maybe that's a good thing. This had a very natural feel to it, rather than something gimmicky and artificial. It also didn't seem to affect my framerates at all, interestingly enough.<p>I wasn't able to test the new armor tinting options, unfortunately, as there weren't any high-level characters around for me to photograph. I did a &quot;/who all 60&quot; and briefly considered asking high-level folks to meet me for a photo session, but I thought that was tacky at best and risking jail time at worst, so I opted out. (&quot;Hi there, have you ever heard of Mobhunter? Could I take your picture?&quot;)<p>Oh, and the other nice thing was that my chat window didn't get garbled when zoning, as promised. Neat, and about damn time.<p>Anyway, we're giving a preliminary &quot;thumbs up&quot; to the changes on Test server. Again, we don't know which changes are going live in Tuesday's patch (or even the patch after that), but certainly a lot of them will. And that makes for a more interesting game for everyone involved--even Moorkatt.
