If you feel like clearing NToV every day, this is good news for you.<p><B>Fixes<p>- Shaved 10 seconds of zoning for every subscriber. <br>- Made it so familiars don't get agroed on. <br>- Fixed several zone crash bugs <br>- Changed a paladin spell - a design error in the spell trivialized several aspects of the high-end game. <br>- Fixed several item and content problems. <br>- Fixed several faction issues - some faction information released with Luclin deviated from norm. <p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>Do you think paladins are <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=13282.topic">upset</a> about their spell being changed? Do you really have to ask?<p>Snap out of it. The spell Thunder of Karana was woefully overpowered, and it should never have gone live. What was Poe thinking? Players silencing mobs... Anyway, it has been changed so that it's now a mana sieve, which is still very useful. That's right, if a mob gates and wipes out your raid, blame the paladins!<p>Oh, and don't forget that bit about zoning times being reduced by 10 seconds. Wow, I guess I'll have 10 seconds less to knit a sweater as I zone. Wherever will I find the time?<p><BIG>Bazaar-o World</BIG><p>Over on Dev Corner, Absor responded to one player's question about whether the Bazaar zone would allow players to set themselves up as automated merchants (thx Ultima Online). Alan <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000417.html">acknowledges</a> that yes, this feature is coming:<p><B>It was certainly on our desired feature list. And we are still working on adding it to the game.<p>We just didn't have time to get all this code working properly for release. Because of the high potential for duplication of items or even item loss when dealing with this kind of code, we've decided it was best to hold on to this feature until it was done. We plan to get it into the game as soon as we can. We decided that delaying the ship of Luclin for this feature, as much as we wanted to get it in, would be a bad idea because players often plan time off around the release of a new expansion and we didn't want to change the date and upset those plans. And rushing a feature like this would lead, at the minimum, to a badly implemented feature. So we thought it was prudent to hold off until it was ready.<p>Alan</B><p>Now, let's take a closer look at the last sentence from that paragraph, just in case you missed it:<p><H2>And rushing a feature like this would lead, at the minimum, to a badly implemented feature. So we thought it was prudent to hold off until it was ready.</H2><p>Uh, excuse me? What color is the sky in your world, Absor? <B>The entire SoL expansion was obviously rushed for release.</B><p>Sorry to jump on you there, big guy, but you honestly can't claim one feature wasn't implemented because the code wasn't ready while entire zones were made live in the same condition. The real reason the Bazaar wasn't finished was mentioned earlier in the paragraph: fear of item duplication--period. I'm willing to give pretty wide latitude for the unfinished parts of Luclin, but let's call a spade a spade.<p><BIG>Epic, or Just Average?</BIG><p>The busy rogues over at The Safehouse have been cataloging <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=3421.topic">armor quests</a> found in the Twilight Sea. There's no way of knowing at this time whether these are the epic armor quests mentioned by Verant before Luclin was released, or if these are designed for mid-level characters. Many of the items that have dropped so far are off relatively low-level mobs, but there is some indication that some pieces only drop off triggered baddies.<p>Welcome to Plane of Sky 2!<p>I guess we'll have to wait for some finished products before we judge the risk vs. reward factor here.<p>Okay, that's it for now. Go and find yourself a Luclin face you can live with before they announce a lockdown. Hmm, lockdown... sounds like we're in prison all of a sudden!
