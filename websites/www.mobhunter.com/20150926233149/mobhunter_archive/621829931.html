So I'm going to make this real easy for you. If you want to hear how horrible a place the Sony offices are and how evil the staff is, you'll want to check out the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-442114102">alternate version</a> of this story, which was designed to satisfy those of you who get off on that sort of thing. Enjoy.<p>Still with me? Okay, then, here we go.<p><BIG>The Arrival</BIG><p>You don't have to be in San Diego very long to understand why a company would want to make its headquarters there. It has gorgeous weather (even if the natives are terrified by a little rain), amazing beaches, and the feeling of a vital city pulsing all around you.<p>As the car took us to the SOE offices on Friday morning, we passed under a high, thin old bridge that crossed over whatever highway we were on. Vines were growing down the sides, and the trees around it made it look like something out of a jungle. It suddenly struck me where I had seen that bridge before: it looked just like the aqueducts that lead to Sebilis. I have no idea if some artist working on Kunark back in the day was inspired by that bridge, but the sight of it gave me the feeling that I was in for an interesting day.<p>Besides myself, the others invited to come this weekend were Allakhazam, Jason and Janae from EQOA Realms, Julian from Stratics, Baelish from Casters Realm, Steve from RPGFan, and Kris from ALLRPG. When we arrived, we all climbed out of the car and were greeted by the official company logo outside a fairly large office building.<p>After being welcomed by Tamara Sanderson, SOE's very nice public relations person, we were lead upstairs to a conference room through halls adorned with posters and paintings of various product covers. After some bagels and coffee, we were introduced to the staff of the PS2 game, EverQuest Online Adventures.<p><BIG>Play at the Station</BIG><p>I'll admit I hadn't had any exposure to EQOA besides exploring the official Web site and reading the back of the package. While the idea of an alternate EQ experience had some appeal to me, I was more interested in the lore of the world 500 years before the Sleeper was awakened than in the actual gameplay. After all, how could a console version possibly have the depth that EQ does?<p>First the team gave us a primer on some of the key differences between EQOA and its PC-based predecessor. You don't leave a corpse when you die. There is no PvP at all (though they are looking into controlled ways of adding it). There are no zones; the world is seamless. Groups are made up of four people rather than six, and variety in their makeup is encouraged. As long as you have one each of the four basic archetypes--tank (warrior, paladin, SK), priest (cleric, druid, shaman), caster (wizard, mage, necro, enchanter), and melee damage dealer (monk, rogue, and sorta bard)--your group will likely be successful.<p>What I found really interesting is that downtime is virtually absent from the game. Hitpoint and mana regen is fast, even when characters are solo--and yes, <I>every</I> class can solo to level 50, though leveling up is much faster with a group. What's even more intriguing is that stats actually matter in this game, and not always in the way you'd think--clerics heal better when they have high charisma, for instance.<p>Basically, the game was designed from the ground up to appeal to the shorter attention spans of the console audience. You can log in and play for as little or as long as you like--if you can't find a group, go solo. The game is meant to be fast-paced and fun, less stressful than EQ can be. As one staffer put it, when you play EQ you lean forward over the keyboard and put your face up to the monitor; when you play EQOA, you are leaning back on the couch in a much more relaxed pose.<p>The team gave us some hints about what's upcoming for the PS2 game. Sales have been steadily growing, and expansions are definitely in the works. A new American server is going up very soon, and localized game servers will pop up in Europe once the network adaptor is ready for that market (the Euro version of the game itself is set to go). More quests are going in all the time--and surprise surprise, players actually <I>do them</I> in EQOA, because they aren't long, boring camps as is so often the case in EQ. The quests are worth doing because armors have level restrictions, so you regularly outgrow your gear and need new stuff. This also prevents twinking without having to resort to using the nodrop tag, by the way, because the really good stuff simply won't be usable by low-level characters.<p>An all-new tradeskill system is in the works, starting off with the ever-popular fishing. Turns out Rod Humble--executive producer of all EQ titles--is absolutely (maybe even unnaturally) obsessed with fish, and will be personally seeing to it that a wide variety of seasonal aquatic life will be catchable in Tunaria.<p>Even though the PS2 doesn't have a hard drive to store data, the game will get patches just like EQ does. The staff claims it can fit quite a bit of info on the 8-meg memory cards the console uses, including fairly major interface changes. The only thing that will require a new DVD is the addition of new graphics and territories. The first major patch is scheduled for March 15, which will include the addition of an autoattack feature and an easier way to keep track of where your group members are. Future patches will include more loot distribution options and confirmation boxes for long-cast spells like ports.<p>After talking about the game a while, Alex von Minden (the EQOA version of Absor) and the team took us downstairs to a room that would make any quad-boxer drool. Down one wall is an assortment of some very nice PCs, and down another is a row of PS2s hooked up to flat-screen TVs. We all took seats in front of the consoles and checked out the level 20-ish characters the team had created for us.<p>Much to my chagrin, I was playing a troll shadowknight! Suppressing a sudden desire to complain about something, I acted as main tank for my group as we were ported around the continent by the team so that we could check out a variety of terrain.<p>While the graphic detail of the models doesn't approach that of the PC game, the characters look a lot better in motion than they do in static screenshots. You don't see your damage coming to you in a window, but in little numbers that pop out of the mob as you hit it. The hardest part of the game for me was getting used to the controller--I play EQ with the keyboard almost exclusively. But after a while, I was fairly adept at moving the camera around and figuring out how to see what I needed to see.<p>Targeting mobs can also be a little tricky, as you hit a button to cycle through all the targets that are near you. It could take me a while to get the target that I wanted, but I was told that the game will first pick up whatever mob is closest to you in the direction you're facing. I never got quite skilled enough at the controller to verify this, however.<p>The dungeons we went to were pretty cool, with a decent variety of look and design. Mobs respawn pretty quickly in a lot of places, so I'd guess that conflicts over camps would be minimal. The fact that loot is mostly distributed over mobs in a given region rather than being mob-specific (aside from bosses, which have unique drop tables) should help with this too.<p>Overall, I was very impressed with the game. It feels like something you can jump into and have fun immediately, rather than going through the many tedious processes that still plague EQ.<p>What really struck me about the team working on the game is how enthused they are about it. I don't just mean in a marketing sense--I mean they <I>really</I> enjoy playing the game. Even guys on the regular EQ team are into it, clamoring for more quests and content just like any player would. Their mandate is clearly to keep adding fun stuff to the game, and all indications are that they intend to live up to that.<p>EQOA is never going to replace EverQuest for me, or for most players of the game. But it certainly seems like it could hit the mark for console gamers making their way into the MMORPG world for the first time, or for those jaded EQ players who need a break from the grind of camping and raiding. As I fall into the latter category from time to time, I intend to continue checking out the Norrath of the past, as it seems like a lot of fun.<p>For those of you who play the game already, Alex provided the following info. I don't really understand all the specifics of stats and items yet, but here you go:<p><B>The Addition of New Level 25 Quests <p>New content has been added to EverQuest Online Adventures servers starting the weekend of March 29th.  These involve side quests for characters level 25 and over that reward new items as well as a class specific spell or ability.  These new adventures start in the more remote villages and hamlets of Tunaria.  Some of them will require would-be heroes, regardless of racial or class prejudice, to prove their worth to the local populace before they can proceed.<p>To give incentive for these quests to be sought out and discovered, below is a brief sample of some of the reward items:<p>Skirmisher's Bracers<br>HP: 5000<br>Dur: 60<br>Str: 15<br>Power: 30<br>AC: 88<p>Fyresong Boots<br>HP: 5000<br>Dur: 60<br>Sta: 5<br>Agi: 15<br>AC: 46<br>Fire Resistance: 10<p>Cobaltic Buckler<br>HP: 5000<br>Dur: 50<br>Sta: 5<br>Wis: 5<br>Power: 48<br>AC: 156<br>Fire Resistance: 5<br>Arcane Resistance: 5<p>Bracelet of Arcane Might<br>HP: 5000<br>Dur: 50<br>Int: 5<br>Power over Time: 5</B><p><I>Part two of my trip report, detailing what I learned about EQ, will be posted later today.</I><br>
