Alan makes the following <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000387.html">request</a>:<p><B>Some time about the middle of next week we plan to put the files for DX8 onto the Test server for you all to download if you'd like to help us test it out.<p>What we really need here is for people with all sorts of configurations and hardware and such to try this out and let us know if there are any problems.</B><p>Just a guess here, but they probably have enough machines with GeForce 2 and Soundblaster 5.1 cards in the Verant offices for testing purposes. What they could probably use help with are odd video and sound card combos that you don't see every day. If you feel like lending a hand, please do so. You can help ensure a smooth transition to Luclin.<p><FONT COLOR="#3333CC"><B>A Guild By Any Other Name...</B></FONT><p>Did you move to Antonius Bayle, the new European server? Did you find the right guild for you? Well, <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000386.html">too bad</a>:<p><B>In our initial enthusiasm to help get things rolling on this new server, we made a mistake with guilds.<br>Basically, we started creating guilds before we removed all the guild associations from the characters. It tends to cause all sorts of trouble when we add someone to a guild when they are already associated with a guild (even if that guild doesn't really exist).<p>So we had to wipe all the guilds from Anotnius Bayle and start over.<p>We will be creating guilds again on Monday the 19th.<p>IMPORTANT: If you were in a guild before this wipe, we need you to make certain that you zone at least once before we recreate your guild. This should clear the guild name from above your head if you still have one. And it is a good idea to do it even if you don't have a guild name over your head, just in case.</B><p>Nothing to get your panties in a bunch over. A /movelog always seems to bring some glitches, but in a week all will be well, and the ubermob hunting shall resume.<p><FONT COLOR="#3333CC"><B>If They Heal Themselves, Do They Get the Message Twice?</B></FONT><p>One of the nicest features of the last patch (the intended one, not the emergency one) was the addition of messages to tell you how many points you heal/are healed for. Unfortunately, this change was not without <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000376.html">problems</a>. One poster complained that a fast-hitting melee type attacking a mob with Mark of Karn cast upon it adds a ridiculous amount of battle spam, and suggested adding a text filter to weed it out:<p><B>The current plan is to not report healing under 10 points or so. This will remove the Mark of Karn issue.<p>We'll have to wait until the new interface is done before we really look at any new filters and things like that. No point in duplicating work.</B><p>Until then, I guess evil clerics have a way to spam their monks, rogues, and warriors into madness. Damn evil clerics!<p>Another cleric mentioned that the recipient of a heal can see how much he is healed for, but the caster of the spell can't. Absor says this will be fixed next patch.<p>A druid with a Velious quest BP asked why /targetgroupbuff allowed him to cast regen on other groups with his BP after the Wednesday patch, only to have this feature taken away with the Thursday patch. Absor revealed that this is working as intended:<p><B>Items are not supposed to work with this ability, just player cast spells.</B><p>Sorry, dr00ds, those regen spells will cost you mana after all. It may not seem like a big deal in this case, but there may be other right-clickable items down the road that would have an unwanted effect on game balance.<p><FONT COLOR="#3333CC"><B>Dial &quot;M&quot; for Monster</B></FONT><p>If you've been looking forward to <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=834211065">being a bug</a> on one of the Zek servers, you've been out of luck since the patch. While &quot;Project M&quot;--the ability to become a low-level NPC on a PvP server--was live briefly, the emergency patch on Thursday saw the feature deactivated. Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000379.html">comments</a> on when it might be back:<p><B>Right now, we don't know. Not only was it causing a bit of crowding on the Zeks (primetime after a patch, nonetheless), but we think we want to fiddle with it a bit more. There were some problems with the implementation, not major but bothersome, that we'd also like to work with a little. Right now it's up in the air.</B><p>Oddly enough, this was one of the neatest ideas Verant has come up with in a while. So how about improving it?<p>The limitations on levelling and zoning are obvious. You don't want level 60 goblins running around in Everfrost, for example. But what if there was another means for advancement?<p>Say, for instance, you start out as a level 3 lava beetle in West Freeport. When you ding to level 7, you get a LOADING, PLEASE WAIT message and find yourself as a giant rattlesnake in North Ro. After you gain a few levels here, you become a scaled wolf hunter in the Field of Bone, and so on. This way, a player could advance to become a high-level NPC (say a max of 50, just for fun) without the constraints of zoning. Maybe you end up as a fire giant, planning a little surprise for adventurers paying a visit to Lord Nagafen. If you become an NPC of a certain level and intelligence, for instance, you might gain the ability to talk and emote.<p>You heard it here first, peeps. Now /feedback it!<p>Not a bad roundup for late Monday night. Who says we don't have a <a href="http://www2.active.ch/~gerstei/main.en.html">nose</a> for news?
