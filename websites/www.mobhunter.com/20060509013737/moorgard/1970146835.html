I should say that we most likely got more than 2 keys per week; I should also say we had 81 keys in the guild when we took the 54 to release the sleeper. There is no argument... to release the Sleeper is a MASSIVE time and people investment.</B><p><I>On Verant's response:</I><p><B>Then last June we managed, after quite a bit of time and work, to take out the 4th warder and release the sleeper. This time there was no punishment to be had. In fact there was not much of anything to be had, as far as Verant responses - with the exception of an occational GM /tell of congratulations. <p>We were met with a bugged trigger of 2 kerafyrms in the zone, then the Sleeper heading to Skyshrine to kill everyone and everything there, then having west wastes and kael crash...<p>Then silence.<p>The only acknowledgement of us waking the sleeper was the !warders in sleepers for about 3 weeks. Then our lead GM was ordered to keep the warders /killed.<p>It took over a month, and a volatile report on Lum the Mad's website to even get any form of Verant official response.</B><p><I>On trying to find the next step in the quest:</I><p><B>Somewhere between here and there, I got into an email dialogue with Verant, offering all I knew, hopefully facilitating the 'debug' process of the script, and perhaps finding out if there was any more to it.<p>There is more to it, although to this day I beleive its 'off the cuff', that is ad lib - making it up as they go along. We were told on the Lum the Mad site, to check out sleepers, we may find something interesting. We went ahead and killed every single mob in sleepers. All of them. We (I) looted a prismatic dragon scale. So, now we had some substance / hint that there was more. Ironically, there was no one to give this scale to at the time...<p>About 4 weeks later (last patch) Melalafen was introduced into west wastes.</B><p>Emil then proceeds to list the multiple rewards for turning in the scale to Melalafen. The results are pretty damn good, but far from the best items in the game.<p><I>His take on the results of the quest:</I><p><B>So, there you have it... the rewards for waking the sleeper... 5 average items that are all COMPLETELY dominated by the loot drops from most mobs in north tov, or dozekar. Bear in mind, you are NOT rewarded with these items WHEN you release the sleeper, but rather you are given the joyous task of FARMING the snot out of sleepers tomb to acquire these EXTREMELY rare scales. Added to this, you don't even have to release the sleeper to receive the reward, you just need to be on a server that has had the sleeper awakened... Where is the justice in someone who has never seen a warder much less taken a part in such a monumental occation as releasing the sleeper - to be given the opportunity to loot a scale, and be given the reward (albeit anticlimatic to say the least)?</B><p><I>How the Melalafen quest is bugged:</I><p><B>After testing the mace, I decided for the time being, the ring was the best suited item for my set up. I went and found Melalafen, isolated him and proceeded to hand him the mace. As I pressed trade, a trash mob in ww aggroed me and, yes you guessed it: Melalafen assisted and killed me. When I was ressed back, I had no mace heh. I have since petitioned, and emailed everyone from Sony GMs, testing, customer support, even abashi. I have received no reply after 9 days (I am aware and sensitive to the events in NY, and am still patiently waiting for at least a reply). The only discernable response, is the Dragon being removed from the game, so I am still hoping that this will be deemed a bug, and not played off as some malevolent trap, which would be ridiculous as well as unbelievable.</B><p><I>Why the Sleeper's quest needs extensive re-thinking from Verant:</I><p><B>It is a fact: When you release the sleeper you remove clawed guardian bracers, dainty gloves, caster masks, sceptres of destruction, gnome illusion masks, the 4 resistance stones, smolders and the monk robe from that server - seemingly forever. You also lower the drop rate of primal weapons by over 75%. Yes, primal (all kinds) will now drop off the 3 named golems, and they in fact have a quicker repop. Even with these 2 factors, primal drops are far far lower than they were when the warders existed. Basically the quest, in its current form punishes anyone on the server who did not get there first. It is a catalyst for major intra-server fights / threats / hatred. Take note of the server-wide spite and hatred taking place on Mith Marr boards today...</B><p>To see what he's talking about, you can <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/fafterlife68829afterlifemessageboard.showMessage?topicID=3492.topic">read</a> all the flack that <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org">Afterlife</a>, the second guild to wake the Sleeper, has gotten from other guilds on their server.<p>Mobhunter has been following the Sleeper story from day one, no doubt boring many of our readers with our refusal to let it die. Why have we stuck to it? Because, I guess, we love an epic story. Even more, perhaps we were clinging to some desperate hope that EverQuest, the game we so love to play, had some compelling, well laid-out story behind it. I was hoping for a really good narrative in a computer game, that gave me the rush of solving a mystery and made me appreciate the skill of the designers, like I felt with Ultima IV and VII, or an old Infocomm game.<p>But it looks increasingly like there is no grand design, and that content is often added to EverQuest merely to keep players occupied until the next expansion. Granted, there was a lot of work put into the backstories of Kunark and Velious, but the inconsistencies make it hard for us to immerse ourselves as deeply as we'd like.<p>Will the questionable outcome of the Sleeper's quest keep us from playing EverQuest? Not likely. But does it take something of the luster away from our dreams of the high-end game? Sadly, more than a bit.<p><I>Thanks to the reader who posted the idea for the title of this story.</I>
