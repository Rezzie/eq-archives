<html><head><title>A Bazaar Update</title></head><body><h1>A Bazaar Update</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-06-27</p><BIG>Ranger Haxx0rs U</BIG><p>Over at the Ranger's Glade, one of their members has poked his way into the EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd.xml on Test server to <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=af49fa3f4d172aa929e87602bdc78bc8&amp;threadid=5200">sneak a peek</a> at the interface for the long-promised Bazaar code. In case you've forgotten, the Bazaar was intended to act as a zone where you could buy and sell items in a more automated manner, with player-run merchants making sure transactions were secure. This functionality wasn't up to snuff at Luclin's release, and has been worked on for the last seven months along with the new UI.<p>While the Bazaar interface hasn't even entered testing yet, what Syrianax has found so far certainly sounds great:<p><B>Query the Bazaar for a list of items that match your search criteria. <br>Search by partial item name. <br>List all items for sale by selected player. <br>List all items that can be used in this slot. <br>List all items that have this statistic. <br>List all items that can be worn by this race. <br>List all items that can be worn by this class. <br>Sort your list of items. <p>...<p>Also the bazaar window interface itself (not the sales search window) has 80, yes EIGHTY, slots for placing items for sale. There is a bank style coin selection and a button you click to set the price on an item. The prices of the items are saves in your .ini file so the prices are saved if you log without selling it. You also click a button to &quot;become a merchant&quot; but I cant tell for sure the ramifications of that. Theres also basic buttons for clear a price, set an item for sale, remove a price, and set an item for sale which has already had the price set.</B><p>It's quite unfair to evaluate functionality at this stage--the Bazaar isn't due until after the new user interface, remember. But based on the screenshot and the info in the thread, it should be pretty darn slick.<p>How do people think to hack into this stuff, anyway? Verant might have to stop giving their files such easy-to-figure-out names!<p><BIG>Fight For Your Right to Roleplay</BIG><p>For the past 35 years, over in the squalor of beer and cheese known as Milwaukee, Wisconsin, they've held Gen Con--&quot;the largest gaming convention in the nation that offers something for every science-fiction, fantasy, or general game-playing fan.&quot; Founded by wargamers and pen-n-paper roleplayers, the event now draws over 25,000 gamers of all types to the humid midwest during the wretched month of August.<p>Verant will once again attend this event and will sponsor a couple different <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/events/gencon_2002.jsp">competitions</a> that will reward players for their combat prowess:<p><B>First event will be a Warrior vs. Warrior battle to the death using equal items. <p>The second event will give you and your friends a chance to compete as a team in a 3 on 3 Gladiator Competition. <p>There will be 8 classes to choose from, all equipped with Epic weapons and equal armor items. You may use 1 of each class to make up your team of 3 to participate in this event. <p>The winners of each of these events will win a one-year free subscription to EverQuest and Gladiator Championship Rings for their play character, as well as your picture with &quot;The Gladiator&quot; in the Ring of Champion's section of our Gen Con 2002 web page.</B><p>The free year of EQ is nice, as is the title. Maybe the ring awarded will be an upgraded version of the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/item.php?id=1739">Golden Championship Ring</a> (AC 7, +4 to all stats, 30 HP/mana, +6 to all saves) that were awarded to the winners of the Test of Tactics events. While that ring was great in its day, it has been greatly eclipsed by newer items.<p>Hmm, wonder if I could convince Kohath and Csenicier to attend, since the August FanFaire is out of our driving range. If there are hotels rooms and free beer, it might be worth trying to convince them.<p><BIG>Still Picking Your Nose</BIG><p>Over in the Casters Realm forums, one of their readers asked if the ability to <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4379">change your face</a> with the new Luclin models has gone away with the new interface. Absor responded:<p><B>We are not disabling the facepick command.  There isn't a button for it in the interface at this point (and right now I don't know if there will be one or not), but the /facepick command still works. <p>We'll certainly let you know before we remove that ability.</B><p>Do people change their Luclin faces anymore? After seven months, players should be pretty well decided on what they want to look like. Sure, it's nice for new players to be able to change their face if they don't like it, but to me the unlimited ability to change your appearance takes away from--ohh, here's the magic word for you--immersion. Yes, the same reason Scott Hartsman cited for not wanting EQ in a window is the same reason I don't think players should be changing their character faces at will. Just my opinion, of course, but I think it makes more sense in my case.<p>But then, of course, I would, wouldn't I?<p><BIG>More Free EQ</BIG><p>Just as Verant did with their recent newsletter, <a href="http://www.ign.com/">IGN</a> is now giving away free EQ Classic accounts. Absor had received some e-mail worrying that this was some kind of scam, so he <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000615.html">assured</a> readers that it was all legit:<p><B>It seems that some folks are concerned about an email that they are receiving from IGN offering them a free Trilogy account. There is some concern that this is a scam.<br>It isn't.<p>IGN has indeed been authorized to give away these accounts. If they give you one, take it! <p>Keep in mind that in order for someone to 'scam' you they'll need to acquire information from you that they can use. If someone asks you for a password on your existing EverQuest account, don't give it to them. IGN isn't asking for such information, they're just giving out accounts.</B><p>I guess Classic EQ accounts are growing on trees these days. It's such a trend that Mobhunter has decided to give away--you guessed it--free Mobhunter accounts! That's right, you can register for the site at absolutely no charge to you! Click that little button at the top of the left-hand menu and knock yourselves out, kiddies.<p>While you're at IGN, check out their <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/363/363442p1.html">preview</a> of Asheron's Call 2. Based on the description and the <a href="http://mediaviewer.ign.com/ignMediaPage.jsp?channel_id=59&amp;object_id=17244&amp;adtag=network%3Dign%26site%3Dpchub%26genre%3Dpersistent+online%26genre%3Drpgviewer%26pagetype%3Darticle&amp;page_title=Asheron%27s+Call+2">screenshots</a>, this could be an interesting game.<p><BIG>The Internet Was Fun While It Lasted</BIG><p>One of the biggest news stories from the last few days has been the <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=578&amp;578&amp;e=18&amp;u=/nm/20020627/ts_nm/worldcom_dc_18">WorldCom scandal</a>, in which the second largest telecommunications carrier has been accused of fraud for misrepresenting its financial statements for the last year or so.<p>So what, you ask? How does another tale of corporate greed and mismanagement affect me?<p>Well, WorldCom was a big investor in UUNet, one of the major Internet pipelines in the US. If WorldCom goes belly-up as is generally expected, the connectivity of EverQuest players could be impacted. Verant's San Diego facilites may suffer from bandwidth loss, since UUNet's Los Angeles lines account for a lot of traffic in the area.<p>It seems unlikely that UUNet would be allowed to dry up, since everyone--including the government--has a major interest in keeping bandwidth stable. But let's just hope that even temporary service interruptions can be avoided.<p>Don't you just love those corporate weasels? I wish I had $3.8 billion to lose track of.<p><I>Thanks to Medik for providing info for this last newsbit.</I>
