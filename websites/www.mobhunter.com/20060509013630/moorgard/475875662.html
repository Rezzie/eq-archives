<html><head><title>Strange Brew</title></head><body><h1>Strange Brew</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-01-30</p><BIG>This Isn't Heaven... This Sucks!</BIG><p>You may have missed the fact that Verant snuck in an apology for the fiasco of Tueday's patch sucking so much. If so, here it is:<p><B>January 29, 2003  2:00 pm<br>------------------------------<p>** Patching **<p>Yesterday's patch definitely won't be one to go down in EQ history as a shining example of Our Finest Hour.<p>The problems that occurred yesterday afternoon and evening, including teleportations to bind points that were accompanied by a client string being displayed at random, are all taken care of.<p>All of the seemingly disconnected problems were the result of a single bug in EverQuest's communications layer that only reared its head on servers that had maintained a certain population for a certain amount of time.  Unfortunately, this doesn't occur as frequently as we'd like on our Test Server, where the effects of this bug never occurred.<p>As always, for those looking for a change, we'd like to once again extend the offer to give the Test Server a try if you're looking for something different.  If you're ever interested, please exit and run TestEverQuest.exe inside your EverQuest directory.  <p>The Test Server is a small community of some of the nicest, most dedicated folks you'll find, and many have eventually called it their home.  If you miss the &quot;small world&quot; feeling of EverQuest, it might be just the thing for you.  <p>(One disclaimer: Test Server does not have full-time Customer Service coverage.  Its primary purpose remains for the development and testing of ongoing changes to EverQuest.  It does get updated much more frequently than the live servers, but all potential changes show up there first.)<p>Thanks very much for your patience, and we do apologize to those who were affected yesterday.<p>- The EverQuest Development Team</B><p>Whenever a new patch totally screws the game up, the first thing out of many players' mouths (and, I confess, sometimes mine) is &quot;WTF??? Don't they test this stuff before they patch it?&quot; But it's a fact of programming that bugs don't always surface until the code reaches a large portion of the userbase--ask Csenicier and Kohath about a little project called &quot;The Commissioner&quot; and they'll tell you.<p>The plea for more users to come to Test server might help, but probably not a lot. Most of us are too busy with other things in life to split our playtime between two servers--and I certainly wouldn't relish the idea of levelling up a temporary character just for testing purposes.<p>However, if there was a <I>different</I> kind of test server, I might spend some time there. If you had the option of copying a character of choice from your home server to this test environment (the copy would be one way, of course, as nothing you gained on the test server could be brought back with you), I'd be more than willing to log in and check out new features, zone revamps, etc. In fact, this would be a much more realistic way of examining game changes, as you'd have a higher percentage of well-equipped players putting content through its paces. The other benefit would be that people like Furor and Thott could log into the same server and settle their differences <I>mano a mano</I>--or at least stand in the same zone and shout at each other.<p><BIG>Just Because I Don't Know What It Is, It Doesn't Mean I'm Lying</BIG><p>Do you find yourself running out of Post-It Notes a lot? Tired of scribbling quest text on the back of matchbooks and gum wrappers? Well, then Legacy of Ykesha has just the thing for you.<p>The latest feature announcement is a <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_npcjournal.jsp">conversation journal</a> that keeps track of NPC text for you. You can organize it by NPC name or location, or collect stuff under your own categories to keep track of it all.<p>One thing I don't see that would be very handy is a way to search by keyword. Say you come across one NPC mentioning some object that you <I>know</I> you saw some other NPC ask for, you could search on that keyword and find the info. Without this kind of functionality I can't see myself using the journal a whole lot, but I'm sure it will still be helpful to many.<p><BIG>Hey, This Piano Has a Computer on It!</BIG><p>Feel like rolling the dice? Registration for Vegas FanFaire is <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=53900">officially open</a>. The deadline for signing up is March 11, but I'd expect the event to sell out long before that.<p>Of course, even if you don't want to spend the $89 to register, you could still come and hang out in the lobby or something. You <I>might</I> be able to find other activities to keep yourself occupied.<p>I'm hopeful there will be a contingent of attractive young Mobhunter groupies waiting for me in Vegas, by the way. Shemales need not apply, thank you!<p><BIG>If I Didn't Have Puke Breath, I'd Kiss You</BIG><p>In case you haven't been paying attention, a lot of what we do here is just making fun of silly stuff. Sometimes topics do come up that deserve a serious look, however.<p>A <a href="http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2003/01/27/daily44.html">new study</a> in a European medical journal suggests that sitting for long periods of time can make one susceptible to blood clots in the legs that can break off and travel to the lungs, which causes a pulmonary embolism. This condition, called e-thrombosis, is a variation of a phenomenon first obsered in people undergoing prolonged air travel.<p>It's a fact of modern culture that a lot of us spend hours every day sitting on our cans behind a desk at work. It's also a fact of the EverQuest community that we then come home and sit for many more hours playing this goofy game. Articles like this are a reminder that it's important to get up every once in a while, run up and down the stairs a couple times, and get that blood pumping.<p>Of course, some idiot will no doubt try to turn this into some kind of class-action lawsuit against SOE--our culture practically oozes litigation these days. And while fatalities due to this condition may be low, the article should still inspire you to get off your ass once in a while.<p>Like, get up and walk to the fridge for a beer and a jelly, eh?<p>Good day.<br>
