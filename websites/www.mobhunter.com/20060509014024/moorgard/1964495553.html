Thank god True North works on horseback, though. I was going to cancel my subscription if that wasn't fixed in this patch.<p>We'll keep an eye on EQ Traders for reports about <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=6123.topic">changes to smithing</a> and other trade skills. Verant has been keeping those folks busy.<p>Let's all just keep our fingers crossed that the servers will be stable after this patch. We don't want a repeat of last week's mayhem, thank you very much.<p>As ever, if you find any interesting changes that the patch message doesn't mention, <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">let me know</a>.<p><BIG>GMs Go Global; IPO Set to Take off</BIG><p>In an effort to improve CS (btw, that's Customer Service, if you're from Verant), SoE's VP of CS &amp; QA (wheee!), George M. Scotto, stopped reading his hate mail long enough to <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=45623">issue</a> the following letter:<p><B>Greetings!<p>In an on-going effort to provide the highest level of Customer Support, we reviewed our In-Game Support methods and have made some changes that we believe will greatly benefit our customer base.<p>We have shifted the manner in which our In-Game Customer petitions and emails are handled and gone to more of a &quot;global queue&quot; approach.  There will no longer be a single Game Master present on each server.  Instead, teams of Game Masters will assist those servers with the greatest need and longest waiting times.  In addition, a dedicated team of Game Masters will also be responsible for answering In-Game email inquiries.  We are confident this change will grant an even higher level of Customer Support by providing faster response times while continuing to provide all of the dynamic quests and events you have come to expect.<p>Game Masters will continue to have a strong presence in Norrath, while providing greater customer satisfaction.  In fact, you will most likely see more of them on your server in the future.<p>Thank you for your continued support.</B><p>For obvious reasons, this is both a good idea and a step in the right direction. How do we know? It's been <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com">done before</a> and it works.<br><I>Editor's Note: Medik wrote the above news item. Thanks, Medik!</I><p><BIG>What Really <I>Is</I> in a Name</BIG><p>Yesterday's roundup featured my opinion on Verant's new name change service, which I am generally opposed to because of the potential for abuse. Rod Humble, Executive Producer of EQ, EQ2, EQOA, and SOV, dropped us a line to explain more fully why the service has been introduced and to give examples of situations where wanting a new name would be appropriate:<p><B>Firstly renaming characters has long been requested. The reasons are very varied but for example if I started a character which I wanted to call &quot;Blackheart&quot; but ended up having to name him, &quot;Blackhearte&quot; because someone had already taken the name. Given the mass of characters created its very likely that &quot;Blackheart&quot; is now free on my server, many characters are very low level newbie characters that end up getting deleted after a customer has decided on which class he will primarily play.<p>Why shouldn't I be able to get the name I always wanted now that it's available? If it takes extra man power to perform this rename and run the necessary checks then a fee is the only way to provide this service. In the past customers have rightfully noted that the only way to get your name changed was to have an offensive name, very frustrating to a customer with a valid reason for a name change.<p>Customers have rightfully expressed irritation in the past at many seemingly arbitrary policies. After all in Norrath why shouldn't a hero change how he or she is known? If Tedo Terin the halfling slays a griffon an action which saves all her party and her guild refers to her as Griffonbane Terin then why not change her name? Surely this adds to players abilities to spin tales of adventure rather than take it away.<p>The reputation issue is a serious one but I would suggest that the safeguards we have put in place offset that. You may only change your name once every six months and we will setup a name register so name changes can be looked up.<p>People with a bad reputation certainly wont be able to escape it by just changing their name, after all they cant change their personalities and that's the root cause of such a reputation. Its also worth noting that our customer service records are linked to the customers ID not character names.<p>The Ebaying issue is an interesting one. As you know we ban and delete any accounts we catch that have been Ebayed or sold. Bringing a sold characters record to the attention of a GM during renaming is somewhat akin to taking a stolen car down to the DMV for new plates. Not the smartest of moves.<p>Cheers!<p>Rod Humble</B><p>Those are some valid points, but I still feel the negative aspects outweight the legitimate desires for a name change. Basically, all serious guilds will have to check the name of everyone who applies against Verant's records to make sure the applicant isn't trying to hide a dark past.<p>Life will be made easier on eBayed toons, too. I don't know how it works on your server, but high-level characters who have been sold generally earn the contempt of the former friends and guildmates who helped outfit that toon. Now it will be harder to make fun of the gimps who bought those characters, because they can simply change their name and fade into the woodwork. Yes, Verant tries to catch those who eBay... but far more slip through the cracks than VI realizes. A GM responding to a name-change request really won't have any way to tell that a particular account has changed hands.<p>This new name change policy won't cause the universe to implode or anything, but I think it will be a bigger asset for shady characters than honest ones. We'll see how it all pans out.<p><BIG>Speaking of Changing Names...</BIG><p>One of our readers sent me this little <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/758473.asp?cp1=1#BODY">tidbit</a> that seems very fitting to mention, given the discussion above. It looks like Verant is the victim of a new Microsoft name change policy:<p><B>Microsoft announced it has signed Sigil Games Online to create Microsoft-branded games. Sigil is the creator of one of the first subscription online role-playing games, &quot;Everquest.&quot;</B><p>Apparently Microsoft is trying to rewrite history once again. The story appeared on MSNBC, after all.<p><I>Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.</I><p>Even Verant needs to be <a href="http://www.bioware.com/bioware_info/press_releases/nwngold/">looking over its shoulder</a> for Big Brother, it seems!<p><BIG>Seven and Counting</BIG><p>As one of our readers recently reminded me, it has now been over seven months since Shadows of Luclin shipped and we <I>still</I> don't have the new user interface or the completed Bazaar zone. Both continue to be features listed on the expansion's box art, of course.<p>Though there are <a href="http://pub175.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11309.topic">signs</a> that more of the Bazaar code is being added, and a little birdy told me that the new user interface is currently being used in house by Verant employees, both these features have taken far too long to appear in game.<p>Yes, there are people assigned specifically to work on this functionality. But clearly these features don't have the priority of Planes of Power, EQ Adventures Online, or EQ2--if they did, we would have them already.<p>Sure, we want both these features to be robust and relatively bug free when they arrive. But we do want them to arrive... and soon, please.<p><I>The new user interface and Bazaar were included with Shadows of Lucllin. The new user interface and Bazaar had always been included with Shadows of Luclin.</I>
