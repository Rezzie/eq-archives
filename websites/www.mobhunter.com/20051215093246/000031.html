<h1 class="article_title">The Meaningless Words of Everquest</h1>
<p>by Loral on September 13, 2004</p>

<p>Jargon plagues Everquest.  We find meaningless words or phrases everywhere. Everyone has an idea, everyone has a complaint, and everyone has something about the game they want to talk about.  Instead of finding ways to properly communicate what our problem is, we fall back to generalizations and buzzwords that may have meaning to us but lose that meaning the more they are used and misused.  These words don't help us communicate with SOE.  Instead of articulating a problem, they muddy the conversation and cloud the real problems.</p>

<p>Five terms in particular get used dozens of times each week on the various forums.  These words add nothing to our conversations and don't help SOE find and fix the problems we gloss over.  If we eliminate them from our vocabulary and speak in detail, we increase SOE's ability to respond.  Lets take a look at these meaningless words:</p>

<p>Uber:  The German word for “Over” describes high end characters, guilds, equipment, or abilities.  We hear about uberguilds and ubermobs.  We use the word as insult or praise when a friend acquires a new shiny item.  Uber is anything more powerful than you.  Some 65 paladins with 300 AA points don't consider themselves uber.  Level 25 rangers tear through Crushbone like a tornado and everyone in the zone considers them uber.  There is no specific use of the word that helps describe a particular state of the game, guilds, or players.  In almost every Mobhunter article I wrote for my first three months, my editor, the uber wizard Azile Ciricbane, had to edit out my use of “uberguild” and told me to replace it with something more specific.</p>

<p>Casual:  Casual is the most misunderstood and misused phrase in the Everquest community.  There are casual guilds who raid the Elemental Planes.  Some casual players have hundreds of AA points and play 40 hours a week.  Everyone has a different definition of a casual gamer.  Sometimes it means low level.  Other times it means non-raiders.  Instead of asking for changes for the casual gamer, we need to describe exactly what it is we desire.  Do we need more short-duration events?  Do we need less locked content?  Do we need higher power equipment available to single LDON / Ornate equipped level 65 groups?  Avoid the word casual, speak in detail.</p>

<p>Mudflation:  This ancient term gets used any time someone sees the game progress and doesn't like it.  Mudflation means little but has a built-in wrapper of negativity that lets us label progression like a package of spoiled meat.   Few describe exactly what they mean when they use the term and fewer can describe how to fix it.  The game gets larger.  The high-end zones get higher.  Level limits increase.  Equipment grows in power.  That isn't mudflation, that's progress.</p>

<p>Timesink:  This is one of my favorites.  Timesinks describe any action in Everquest that someone doesn't enjoy.  Everquest is a timesink.  Reading a book is a timesink.  I know one perfect way to avoid timesinks.  If you aren't enjoying what you do, do something else.  Before you begin telling me that you HAVE to camp shards to get intoVex Thal or you HAVE to get your Ring of Scale faction up, remember that this entire game is voluntary and the world is big enough to find a million other and often more enjoyable things to do.  If you find a particular event or hunt that bores you to tears, instead of labeling it a timesink, just tell SOE what you don't like about it.  Speak in details, not overused and meaningless generalities.</p>

<p>Class Balance:  Classes, by definition, cannot be balanced.  Every class is good at some things and bad in others.  There is no way to balance the wide variety of skills from one class to another.  How does one compare the blasts of a wizard to the slows of a shaman to the healing of a cleric?  With limited combat interaction it becomes difficult to make every one of the sixteen classes unique yet not required for a group.  SOE can tweak class abilities and help support those unique roles.  SOE can also tune encounters so they work well with particular class archetypes as they did with knights and the Ikkinz trials.  There is never a clear solution for class balance and there is no conclusion.  Classes cannot be balanced without ruining the unique skills that each class has to offer.</p>

<p>Every day players interact with SOE and every day players use these terms to gloss over deeper problems or recommendations.  When you find yourself using one of these terms when writing a message board post or sending feedback, ask yourself what you are really saying and replace it with detail.  Instead of asking for more casual-friendly content, ask for more single-group events that don't require raid gear.  Instead of complaining about timesinks, ask for more Ring of Scale faction options.  We love our meaningless terms but our communication becomes stronger and SOE's ability to respond becomes greater when we say exactly what we mean.</p>

<p>Yet these words bring up powerful images to all of us.  EQ has its own language that we use everyday.  They are not meaningless words, they are words that trigger an emotional reaction.</p>

<p>I agree it is important to give details. Players come from across the globe, there are very few words that mean the same thing to everyone.  It would be nice if everyone posted messages in detailed proper english and not use 'dewd speak' or terms that someone from outside the game would not understand.</p>

<p>The same word means different things depending on server, guild, class, age, etc...  SoE and Varant made 1000s of changes to the game all of which changed the meaning of the terms we use.  </p>

<p>The list of meaningless words in EQ could fill a book.  The same can be said for the English language.  </p>

<p>It is just important that we communicate!  If something needs to be clairified than say 'I don't understand what you mean by Uber'</p>

<p>Picking at what people say or correcting them on syntax just drives people apart.  Look for the meaning of what they say.. not how they say it.</p>

<p>
<p>Well, I can agree with some of the words but not others.</p>

<p>Mudflation describes a very specific thing.  It's not about progress it's about a game's age.  As new things get added the old things lose value.  It's not just items, although that's what it usually gets applied to, it's also about areas.  As a mud aged, new areas would get added which would either be ignored or they would replace existing areas.  How many people are in Sebilis anymore?  That's a very valid term.  When OoW comes out no one will be surprised to see some areas ignored.</p>

<p>Class balance:  You describe balancing classes for power but just about everyone agrees with one aspect of balance that has always been desirable.  The ability to sit down and actually play the game.  To this day I will never manage to make a character which gets as many invites to group as my piddly little cleric.  I have a partially time geared wizard that gets occasional invites, but my cleric can (and has been) AFK in the bazaar in trader mode and get multiple invites to group.  We all want a piece of that aspect of balance.</p>

<p>Thank you for the comment, Wyldrose.  You and I seem to agree on most everything except the conclusion.  Words that bring powerful yet different images to each of us do little good in helping us communicate.  I picked some of these words, specifically mudflation and timesink, because they are charged with emotion yet lacking in specific meaning.  We might as well replace them with "things I don't like".  </p>

<p>Uber and Casual are dangerous to the game.  They try to take five hundred thousand players and articulate them into two groups.  New features are sold as "casual friendly" when it really means its for low-level folks.  I don't like the term Casual at all.  Instead I prefer to talk about people with limited play time, people of lower levels, single-group hunters, or pickup raiders.  Even these tend to overgeneralize.</p>

<p>Some of these words, like Mudflation, Timesink, and Class Balance are simply annoying.  Others like Casual could steer the game in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Everquest has no lack of players willing to communicate but many of these players lack the tools to communicate effectivly.  Throwing out these general and meaningless words and speaking in detail helps players steer the game in the right direction.</p>

<p>Meaningless metaphors and phrases plague modern writing.  Orwell pointed this out in 1945 and its just as true today.  You find these terms everywhere and Everquest is no different.</p>

<p>I don't wish to pick at what people say and I don't wish to drive them apart.  I wish for people to speak in details instead of broad generalities.  I want to see people speak with facts instead of emotions.  Let our emotions manifest themselves when we battle the Muramites!</p>

<p>The problems with these terms are emotions and opinions. Since these terms do not appear in any dictionary (as far as I could find) there is not set definition for them. The logical conclusion can only be that everyone thinks these terms convey a different message, leading to confusion.</p>

<p>On the whole I agree with Loral that terms should be used less, and that clarity helps us all in the end. On the other hand I agree with Wyldrose that telling people to not use these terms like 'uber' is just not feasible in the 'real world' (norrath) because they have been use for so long, and are integrated into the community so deeply.</p>

<p>Thank you, hoshisabi.  You bring up a couple of interesting thoughts.</p>

<p>Your definition of Mudflation supports a lot of what I say.  You bring up details of the term that are often lost on people who use it.  As new zones and new content get added, people don't use the old zones as much.  That itself is an interesting debate.  It is certainly true, but what damage does it cause?  Few think of that as mudflation though.  Many use Mudflation to talk about the dropping prices of bazaar loot or the increased power of high-level players.  Either way, it means many different things to many different people.</p>

<p>Your discussion of class balance is also interesting when you dig into the details.  I played a cleric for the last five years and also had few problems getting into a group, but recently I find that the groups I get in to would be better off with a druid.  My healing ability isn't required for LDON normals and Druid DPS is far superior.  Much of this is due to player perception, not the specifics of the classes.  Again, this is an excellent topic that is not represented well by the generic term "class balance".</p>

<p>Thanks, Feday.  It was never really my intent to see these words disappear.  You're right, they won't.  What I do hope is that some people will see the confusion and obfuscation (Thanks Azile!) that these generic terms create and begin to speak in more detail about what they actually mean.</p>
</p>

<p>I agree on some parts and not on others. Mudflation is most prevelaint in the lower levels of a game. Take newb armor, now take the same newb and have him farm for plat and run to the bazaar. (this isn't hard some of the rats in freeport drop an item that sells for a plat.) He isn't twinked, but due to mudflation has armor outside what SOE considers level apporiate. This is a problem, but I don't see it as a "huge" problem.</p>

<p>I like what you had to say about casuals, what I think most ppl miss, is this. Its nothing to do with the time you play, and everything to do with your goals/desires. I know lots of ppl casual by time, but not by what they want. Although I bet the would aruge to get casual's an upgrade in gear or power, to lower the differance between raiders and non-raiders. And why cause this has to be done by makeing non-raiders more powerful, as SOE isn't going to nerf the raiders.</p>

<p>But I don't think these words are the root of any problems.  You can tell from context what most people mean, when they use these words. I don't think SOE would fix what most people consider broken. Because other people were able to get around it, so should you.</p>

<p>As you pointed out, you can't get all classes balanced, not without stripping away some of the unique of the classes. But here is where SOE is getting sneaky, lets look at OWW. And useing wizards as an example as there a straight DPS class. 20% focused SoS is more efficent the the level 70 10% focused. hmmm..you say why would they do that. And here, imo is why. Caster vs. melee balance, As spells have been prety easy to get compaired to say a rogue time dagger, the balance between a non-raiding rogue and non-raiding wizard is quite a bit. NOW under OWW, there as balanced as they were at 65. Unless they start to raid, and get gear.</p>

<p>Now that they have that all worked out, they can look at relative balance between the classes. I think that is why they have been putting so much on hold for balance till OWW ships.  I don't care for the top down balanceing they seem to like to do. if most people who play aren't 65, who will soon be 70, I have no idea why they do this, of course I don't think there quite telling the truth about that either. I think they leave stuff off, like at any given time. Cause I don't know a whole lot of ppl who don't have 65 chars, other then me. :) </p>

<p>I agree that at any given time, more information is better then useing broad terms, but I have serious dobuts that it would have made any differance.</p>

<p>It's fnny how people can almost completely miss the point. Loral isn't saying stop using these words EVERYWHERE, but rather, when discussing something on boards or with devs, don't use game-speak or these overused terms; what seems plain and obvious to you by using these words, may not be plain to others, and in fact, others may think those terms mean something somewhat or completely different.</p>

<p>As Loral implied, get to the point! And don't use emotionally charged words to do it. Keep It Simple should be your guiding principle when posting. Instead of talking about "stupid timesinks", say "I don't think there are enough ways to increase faction with Chardok" or "There should be other ways to progress in the game for PoP flagging", etc. Say what you mean.</p>

<p>A statement like "EQ is falling prey to mudflation" is a practically meaningless statement because mudflation means so many different things to so many different people. You may as well have said "EQ is falling prey to calcifitoriosis." That statement will help get your TRUE point across to almost as many people (and by that I mean: not many) and be just as useless in the exchange of ideas.</p>

<p>Instead, say something like "Sony is putting items in the game that are so powerful, they are going to have even more difficulty in their attempt to balance the classes against each other and against mobs, not to mention not having much room for improved items in future expansions."</p>

<p>That is a much more informative statement with much less confusion as to what you meant. And see? What I think of as mudflation may be different from what you think of as mudflation. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>p.s. I made up calcifitoriosis, so it may or may not actually be a word. But then again, that's the whole point isn't it.</p>

<p>Frankly I think you're being a bit obtuse on some of these, particularly class balance. Most people involved in those discussions know pretty well what others mean by those terms.</p>

<p>But I'll overlook that because I heartily agree with you that "casual" is far too loosely defined and that sloppiness is doing serious harm to the game. Less by the players (the term has been all but banished from The Runes, for instance) than by SOE staff. Here are some definitions of casual players I've seen:</p>

<p>1) People who do not raid frequently with a guild organized primarily for raiding (i.e. not a "family" guild).</p>

<p>2) People who raid very rarely or not at all.</p>

<p>3) People who do not play in long sessions.</p>

<p>4) People who do not spend a lot of time playing the game.</p>

<p>5) People who are not particularly interested in increasing the power of their character.</p>

<p>There are a few others I've seen, but don't think deserve serious consideration.</p>

<p>SOE has been guilty of assuming that people who meet one of these definitions meet all of them. Absor was (is?) particularly bad about this: some of the quotes where he essentially says that if  you don't raid you shouldn't care about your gear or having all your spells should be studied by business students world-wide as an example of how NOT to talk to your customers.</p>

<p>But I think SOE may be waking up to the fact that people who meet definition #1 don't necessarily meet definition #5. In fact as far as I can tell very few people who meet #5 are still playing the game (which makes Absor's statements all the more ironic).</p>

<p>Basically, progression is what EQ is all about at this point. If people can't progress they will quit. Heck, even if they see that at some point in the near future they will no longer be able to progress they'll go ahead and quit now. We need to move beyond "uber vs. casual" or even "raider vs. non-raider" (even though that's a huge improvement) and make sure all the various subpopulations that enjoy EQ can continue to progress.</p>

<p>And yes, the first step is to realistically identify who they are and get beyond lumping most of them together as "casuals."</p>

<p>
<p>My idea of timesink:</p>

<p>A "timesink" is directly connected to the fun in a game. A personal, subjective concept but that can be transformed into something objective.</p>

<p>Basically a timesink is a part of the game that isn't really present. It's a "hole" in the fabric of the game. A timesink could be the travel time when during the travel nothing really happens. Or a player waiting a bar to fill.</p>

<p>Often a "timkesink" is compared to the repetition and this fits my model. Repetition is a strategy in the design to "fill" a space (in the gameplay) that isn't being actually developed.</p>

<p>A "timesink" is exactly a design strategy that replaces the void left by the gameplay with a time-sink. What should have been covered with gameplay is now hidden by an expense of time or a repetition of an action.</p>

<p>And the repetition is the link to the fun. Because the fun directly depends on what is felt "new".</p>

<p>Good Article Loral.  I love this site and your presence here has improved on what I otherwise thought could not be improved.  I scan the sites as I've done for the last four years but, this is the first one I check every time I log in.  I eagerly await new articles and am always excited to see a new EQ character picture because I know I'm going to be treated to a relevant and well thought out article.

<p>I think the distinction between casual and non-casual gamers is something that merits quite a bit more discussion, and really something that SOE needs to get a handle on if they want to seriously move forward with the game.</p>

<p>In my view, there are several different areas that all work together to determine how someone plays the game:</p>

<p>- Time to play.  Some people can play for 80+ hours every week, others for only a few on specific days.</p>

<p>- Ambition.  Some people are driven to progress their character and obtain new items, spells, levels, and so on - and others are not so driven and are just out there having fun.</p>

<p>- Immersion.  Many people see the game as nothing more than a hack-and-slash fest with a chatroom.  This is why we see silly character names and conversations in game.  Many others are deeply interested in the integrity of the game "world" itself.</p>

<p>- Activities.  Some people like raids, some people don't.  Some people like outdoor zones and others prefer dungeons.</p>

<p>- Challenge.  A great many players are content with very little in the way of challenge - other players completely thrive on it and grow bored quickly if not presented with insanely difficult areas to conquer.</p>

<p>You can't define "casual" gamers based on any one area - to do so ignores a lot of other things that factor into someone's enjoyment of the game.  I know many players and no two of them are exactly alike in how they approach the game.  Some have lots of time but little ambition, others have lots of ambition but really don't care about the story, and others still have moderate amounts of time, but hate to raid and constantly seek out the most challenging things they can do.</p>

<p>
<p>I have to also disagree on the term "mudflation".</p>

<p>I spent a few years writing for MUDs and they suffered the same problem that everquest does - an inflationary cycle of player power and creature/item power that occurs as new content is added to the game.</p>

<p>Most people think of progression, or expansion of the game as the game having more to do.  New places to go and explore, new things to fight and conquer, and new treasures to find and use.  It goes without saying that in a level-based game these items and places will have to be more powerful than existing ones in order to entice players to use them.</p>

<p>The cycle is this - the original game is more or less balanced for players of all levels.  The game expands, and more challenging areas are added.  Encounters become tougher.  To compensate, players are granted more power in order to lower the difficulty of these encounters.  This is a normal, healthy cycle for any online game.</p>

<p>Mudflation is an ambiguous term.  It can refer to the cycle of expansion and progression, or more commonly it refers to a power bleed effect.  It's a given that expanding content will trivialize older content for a percentage of the player base.  That's expected - after all, that's why the new content was added.  The folks at the top will go do the new stuff, and the old stuff won't really challenge them anymore.  However, mudflation occurs when the additional power given to the players in the new content gets used by lower-level players in lower-level areas.  The best way to recognize mudflation is to look at the impact on the parts of the game that were not actually expanded.  For example, if all of the new content you added to the game was for levels 40 and above, yet suddenly, your level 20 characters are having a much essier time of things - you have mudflation.</p>

<p>Everquest is not alone in this problem.  Most online games have struggled with it and very few have overcome it.  In my experience, there is only one way to really prevent this from occurring and that is to be extremely strict when it comes to itemization and new content.  If you add a new level 30 dungeon, then it needs to be no more or less challenging than any other level 30 dungeon.  The weapons you add to that dungeon need to be equivalent in power to the weapons in other level 30 dungeons, and just as difficult to obtain.  This is a challenge for most area designers, as they are trying to come up with things that would entice players to try out the new area.</p>

<p>If you have a game with a history of this problem, the only way to really address the existing damage is quite simply to rewrite the older areas of your game.  The balance of things can be restored if you recognize that you have significantly raised the bar on player power.  Old areas will have to be redone, old items will have to be upgraded and replaced to correspond to the new "standard" of player power at all levels of the game.  For a pay-for-play game like Everquest, this is something that players will appreciate, but that won't really earn the company any more money in the short-term.  Long-term, it creates a healthier game which retains players, but I can count on one hand the number of business and marketing executives I've met who would really understand the importance of something like that.</p>

<p>Over the years the various members of the EQ Live team have all struggled with this, and they've made some visible attempts to try and rein things in - I think we can all agree that the recommended and required levels on items were a good step.  Unfortunately, they didn't do enough to stop this early on, and as a result there's a lot of content in the game which is simply not used even though there are still players to use it.  While it remains to be seen how much worse this gets, in my opinion there's already a very large "cleanup" project that should be done.</p>

<p>I have a 58 druid and a 39 cleric, and I can tell you who gets pestered for groups. It's not the druid with the lfg flag, mostly ornate gear etc etc. It's the cleric with dwarven plate who is already in the middle of another group. In fact, i never got a tell on the druid asking for a group except from a friend who needed  help in a particular situation eg tracking, port. As  a time limited player, i play the druid, get killed, find no cleric is available or willing to rez  me for the few hundred i can offer (as many have said, who doesn't have a 65 character... the answer is me. The 65's are way too busy and rich to bother rezzing people, at least at the times i can play).</p>

<p>My cleric, on the other hand, gets a group when he wants mostly (and has been ripping up the levels), solos when he can't, can take more risks due to less fear of death, will be able to make money from buffs at a time the pay per port system is died ( i got sick of being harassed for ports when  i was in roleplaying mode, and never sow a stranger unless they offer to donate (don't care how much, it's the recognition not the moolah) or they don't ask (don't ask me for buffs and i'll throw my mana at you; "sow plz" me and i'll go completely deaf)).</p>

<p>It is fun to port in, throw my baby buffs at someone fighting wisps, and port out before they figure out what happened.</p>

<p>On a side note, I'm amazed how many people would rather let their level 30 body rot than get a 35% rez. I'm hoping it will change at 50% but given the general eq population, i'm not optomistic. </p>

<p>Clicky rez really dominates, and i worry about how to get my epic being time limited, guildless, australian, etc... if anyone knows a guild that can accept those limits on rodcet nife, yes i will join provided i don't spen my time power levelling 'cause i just can't stand that, my last three guilds were either being pled or pling others, and i want the little free time i have to be fun, not work.</p>

<p>I'd really love to go on a raid, get an epic,  see some of th zones i've always read about, get all factions for my iksar so he can walk into any non-evil city in norrath without being assualted by some racist bastard. These are dreams that have kept me playing since the release of kunark when  everyone i knew who played with me has long since left.</p>

<p> I have never been able to influnce sony so that they help people get barbarian faction (eg by  killin goblins, can't be hard to edit their faction can it? Or ice giants? I have never been able to change sony so that iksar monks can abandon evil and become like the shao lin monk of "kung fu" that I adored as a boy, despite a gazillion feedbacks. I'm doing the nearest equivalent of praying an atheist can do that the next expansion will have something for me in the task system, and I fear that they won't because as far as i can tell, the roleplayers and time-limited are in the too-hard basket, and it's a real shame, because for all it's defects, i love this game and my characters, and when eq folds, i'd like to be able to say "I climbed my mountains. You can't see them, or touch them, and others climbed higher, but I got their, with stubborness and wit".  </p>

<p>And not because i was a child or unemployed or rich and either bought my way to the top, or could be supported by my parents as i repeated the same actions till my fingers bled so that my xp and aa bars maxed and i was uber and killed all the gods solo including my own and got all the phat lewts and lived to crow over the others who weren't as rich or powerful as i was.</p>

<p>I have to agree with Loral's premise.  Different words, as has been made explicitly clear just in response to this thread, mean different things to different people.  Among friends it's one thing to use jargon, with the developers, etc. it's another thing entirely.  For example, I very much want to level, and progress, and see high end zones, and have cool equipment.  I get to play about 10 hours a week but have real difficulty finding groups that are my level that want what I want.  Even my friends are less interested in progressing and more interested in tradeskills, and socializing than ever raiding.  If I want SOE to address my concerns, that is entirely different than what may concern my friends, yet we would both be labeled "casual" and I...who wish beyond all reasonable hope that I'll reach the high end (over 55) content some day, somehow, will never have my issues addressed under the "casual" umbrella.  That became painfully clear reading transcripts from the guild forums that SOE sponsored not too far back.  People raised issues for "casual" gamers several times, but generally they all meant different things, and they all wanted something different than I want. I'm sure there are many, many others who feel as I do but unless we specifically address our issues rather than whining about "casual" content, we'll never get heard.</p>

<p>I think that was one of the most useful posts I've read and could go a long way to helping further discussion.  Clearly some have already tarred you as "casual" and thus disregard your legitimate viewpoint - maybe they should reread your article.</p>

<p>I do echo the comment on mudflation not necessarily being a derogatory term - I always refer to looking forward to mudflation as I like the fact it lets my guild go back to content that is old for some, and for us to do it with less players or in less time.  </p>

<p>I think "mudflation" is less about "twinking" or any normative judgment, as it a fairly precise description for doing any encounter with equipment/skills/levels that weren't available when the encounter was originally tuned/designed.</p>

<p>
<p>I see mudflation as a bad thing in general, but I'll be the first to admit that I prefer single-group encounters to be much more difficult than many other players I know, and that tends to skew my opinion quite a bit on what an acceptable level of challenge is.</p>

<p>I think you have a pretty good definition there Teory.  And I would agree with you that in some cases mudflation in Everquest has helped my guild to do some things that were simply impossible before because we couldn't make the numbers or time commitments.  I'm not really sure the ends justify the means though, especially when I consider the large amount of unused low and mid-level content in the game now and the number of players I meet who have never learned how to deal with a tough encounter simply because they've never had to.</p>

<p>I don't generally agree with raids over 36 people, but I also don't agree with single groups being able to kill dragons and planar minibosses either.  Where do you draw the line?</p>

<p>Having read the comments so far , i am impressed with theone main point which seems to be overlooked , Communication . <br />
The accurate exchange of data between two or more bodies is what is really a point in the making </p>

<p>Most of the posts so far are about the words themselves rather then the accurate 'exchange of data' (to use my own interpretation , others will have their opwn views on communication too )</p>

<p>Any words we use SHOULD be understandable by the people to whom we direct them.</p>

<p>Loral has mentioned this ,<br />
 yet we are seeing posts by people examining the correct use (or not) of the terms that seem to be used without due care and attention with regards to the chosen recipients </p>

<p>Communication hmmm</p>

<p><br />
If I write to someone I expect to be able to communicate with them IE they can understand the concept presented </p>

<p> If i use incorrect terminology and/or Jargon , this same concept may not be understood.Which makes the entire exercise worthless for the purpose for which it were intended </p>

<p> So as for UBER ,MUDFLATION, L337 'WHATEVER' <br />
they means differnet things to different people.<br />
and can actually be misleading in context </p>

<p>IE 'Please Mr SOE  , gimme more casual content .........'what on earth does that mean ?</p>

<p>( see above for a variety of definitions )</p>

<p><br />
so the simple fact is don't use them in a communication you consider to have any purpose,<br />
and if that communication has no purpose ,then why bother with it in the first place </p>

<p>To state that 'a casual player isn't as important as uber leet guild named after a book some guildleader once read' , well I leave you to ponder what the hell this paragraph actually means to YOU , because it probably means something totally different to the guy in the corner who just bought EQ Special edition number 12 , </p>

<p>I've decided to stop calling myself casual and start calling myself time-limited as a result of this article and I hope that we can communicate our needs to Sony better, because thus far they seem rather clueless.</p>

<p>I bought OOW for my two accounts, and having finally  been able to stay online long enough to turn off all the nifty new features which can't be turned off out of game as far as i can tell, and which were actually powering off my pc completely(!), I tried out the tasks system. </p>

<p>Now remember when sony promised solo ldons for casual players? then said they couldn't do that but would give them tasks instead? Well, this is the gist of what people said in the PoK chat: at low levels, forget it, you'll be assigned to solo red mobs in dangerous zones (my cleric was assigned to solo drachnids in firona vie, which would be a neat trick!)  At high levels, you can be assigned deep blue or even light blue mobs, which one level 66 necro there was saying he was doing so quickly he had to stop to give his fingers a rest.</p>

<p>I'm deeply disappointed. SWG had tasks which might be to deliver a package, make something, kill this many mobs (wasn't easy but it was quite doable to my untwinked wookie), and all along the way if i had to log out to deal with real life, I could. The everquest team completely fumbled the ball for the people they claim comprise the majority of players (under 65) with their task system, despite  every promise they made. Maybe they think "casual" means "don't care" and maybe we neeed to communicate with them forcibly that time limited doesn't mean uninterested.</p>

<p>
<p>I guess success or failure of the task system as a whole depends on what the objective of the system was.  I am mostly enjoying the task system for the following reasons:</p>

<p>1.  It gives better exp than I can normally get solo, plus better platinum than i get from the typical ldon split.<br />
2.  Every time I take a task, I end up running into two or three other players also working on their tasks and we form a group to help each other finish.  I meet new people this way AND get the tasks done.<br />
3.  I don't have to worry about the task expiring or anything - if i have to log out, or if something else comes up like a guildie needing a rez, then i can stop and come back to the task later.<br />
4.  The longest it's taken us so far to complete a group full of tasks is about 2 hours - not much longer than a single ldon can take counting time to get the group together, time to buff, and time to do the adventure.</p>

<p>The way I see it, tasks are great for when you don't have a group ready to go or can't find one.  There are a lot of times when i find myself sitting lfg at any one of the wayfarer camps, or trying to find a cleric or something to start a group.  Now, I can just go get a task, head out, and along the way meet up with a couple of folks and duo or trio our way through the tasks - we could never complete an LDoN like that.</p>

<p>I consider tasks a success in that they add something interesting to the game, and they are encouraging people to group and meet new people, but not requiring large, well-balanced groups like LDoNs do.</p>

<p>However, if their intent was to add solo content for players, then in this they have failed.  The only people who can really solo tasks are people who were soloing in dungeon areas before.  If you're a class that's traditionally group-dependant, like say a rogue, then you won't be able to complete many tasks on your own.</p>

<p>I guess that SOE could probably use better testing and feedback for lower-level tasks.  Most of those on Beta were level 65s so most of the testing probably went into those catagories.  Send /feedback  on the tasks that appeared way to difficult and they will probably work them into a bit more reason.</p>

<p>I will dig my 37 rogue out of mothballs and try it out as well.</p>

<p>class balance is a Real and important topic for MMO's to weigh and to make sure work in game. a game  out of "balance" is a game where the majority of players pick a single "setup"(see ac1/2) or class. a class out of balance is one that rarely anyone plays due to the game not having a purpose for the class(monks in eq currently are the least balanced class currently)</p>

<p>right now eq is less balanced than at anytime of its 5 year history.</p>

<p>things that the devs have done have altered the unique balance time and time again and right now it needs improvement badly.</p>

<p>this is not saying a wizard should play equally as wel las a warrior, but within the game there needs roles and purposes for every class and right now there are some glaring deficiencies for the pure melee class.</p>

<p>most of us that play eq love the game and are passionate about our class we choose to play. seeing your class gutted due to a perceived imbalance by another class "to balance" them is wrenching. monks were nerfed just prior to pop because of "balance" - sure soe got it all WRONG on their solution and monks have been trying ever since to get them to FIX it (and yes even the devs say there is something wrong with monks).</p>

<p>Relative Balance is paramount in a mmo. it is NOT meaningless it is one of the most important aspects of a mmo. </p>

<p>without Balance the game is not as GOOd.<br />
without Balance the game is not as fun, <br />
without Balance people stop playing..</p>

<p>getting the balance right is the hardest thing a dev has to do.</p>

<p>samples of BALANCE issues that have come up</p>

<p>swarm kiting by bards <br />
charm by enchanters<br />
manaburn way back when<br />
monks vs warrior ac/mitigation<br />
there are lots of others</p>

<p>those are balance isses that needed addressing. </p>

<p>to say anything else shows how naive the person saying it is.</p>

<p><br />
as for me i am a time limited player. i am NOT casual, but have limited time to play the games i play.</p>

<p>
<p>I agree that Class Balance is something that's important to the health of the game.  I can understand Loral's point of view - a lot of times people use the term simply because they feel like their class isn't powerful enough, or can't do something it should.  That's not really what it's supposed to mean though.</p>

<p>Class Balance means that while classes should be relatively unique, each one should have a place in a group and be equally preferred.  Right now, the biggest problem is with the second part of that statement.  EQ has never succeeded in getting away from the "holy triumvirate" of cleric, warrior, and enchanter for many encounters, especially higher-end encounters.</p>

<p>People can argue endlessly all day long about what should or shouldn't be done to improve things, but to my mind the only way to fix it is really to concentrate on the areas in which the game needs improvement.</p>

<p>I will go on record right now as saying that my primary character is a paladin and as far as our role in groups goes, I think my class is perfectly fine.  Sure, I'd like to see my damage output go up some, because while i can take the hits i don't do much damage, but that doesn't mean my class isn't balanced.</p>

<p>If the devs were to work on ONE THING related to class balance, I would hope that it was the cleric requirement.  No offense to clerics, I have a 52 cleric myself and I love him, but it is simply wrong that one class should be considered required for so much of the game's content.  And while it's true that I can do a lot of things with a druid or shaman healing, assuming they're on the ball, there are still way too many things that we simply can not do without a cleric in the single-group game.</p>

<p>"a game out of "balance" is a game where the majority of players pick a single "setup"(see ac1/2) or class."</p>

<p>I guess EQ has never been out of balance then. :P</p>

<p>More seriously, I think this is an interesting test: if a class ability is so "unbalanced" it should cause at least some people to switch classes to take advantage of it, right?</p>

<p>Recently on The Runes someone started a thread asking why people started playing their enchanter. A surprisingly common response was that they started them as a KEI-bot but found that the class was more fun than their main. Do we conclude that it's not enchenter charm that's overpowered, but KEI?</p>

<p>Basically I think most class-envy is really overwrought and I wish SOE would ignore 95% of it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the reverse does seem to be happening. There are classes that seem to be all but disappearing. Monks top the list, but I rarely see SKs and mages either. Bards, despite being supposedly overpowered, are also quite rare. Of course this is just my experience and represents a fairly small sample, but I suggest SOE gather some real numbers to see which classes they most need to worry about.</p>

<p>This article is absolutely awful.  The reason these words get bandied about so much is because they describe everything that is wrong with EverQuest.  It's like someone complaining about that the words "disease", "virus," or "infection," because they don't effectively describe how to solve the problem.  The words aren't the problem; they just describe it.</p>

<p>err no disease virus & infection are all "nouns. None of Lorals are. Therfore your anology is flawed IMHO.</p>

<p>To continue your anology tho...try thinking of Loral as saying "Unknown sickness", "The ickys" & the "I feel like craps". Then try & imagine SOEW as the doctor. So wgat Loral is saying is that how can th doctor help you if you cannot describe your symptoms.</p>

<p>Agreed. And timesink is one of the biggest offender in my opinion. Hate that term.</p>

<p>As to class balance, I think agree again. Soe has managed to balance some classes right out of their original places. Read the original Eq manual regarding Rangers. Track down the many many SK nurfs. But, then all classes feel they have been hit with the nurf stick more than any other I think.</p>

<p>Re: Durg Bloodfirst, you evaluated my assessment based on whether the examples I gave were nouns.  A completely idiotic point to make, since "class balance," "timesink," and "mudflation" are in fact actually nouns.  You choose to nitpick, and you couldn't even get that much right, you imbecile.</p>

<p>In fact, I share your sentiment about how the words don't convey the necessary information to solve the problems.  However, while they fail to do that, they accurately convey that there are indeed problems with EverQuest that must be addressed, in the same way that "disease," "virus," and "infection" indicate to doctors that a person is physically unwell.</p>

<p>Oh, and it's spelled "grammar," not "grammer."  Dolt.</p>

<p>
<p>I will have to disagree with a couple of the top five most over-used and misunderstood terms that you listed. Here are a couple terms that I see all the time, and a summary definition of them.</p>

<p><br />
leet or l33t (n). A bastardization of the word "elite" in "hacker speak". Similiar to "uber", it is not quite the same thing but often can go hand-in-hand. While uber is best used to describe and item or anything else tangible (ex an uber breastplate), l33t is more apt to describe something intangible such as skill, knowledge, etc. Of course, sometimes they are mistakenly inter-changed since often people that have the most skill are able to acquire the best equipment, and vice-versa people with the best equipment have the most leverage to display their abilities. Of course, this touches upon the entire class balance issue, because a melee class that is l33t but not uber won't do you much good in a tough zone/encounter, and as much can be said about a cleric or enchanter that is uber but not l33t. For example, I can take the most talented warrior with 5 kazillion AA but is only ldon and EP geared and he will get owned in Ikkinz. On the hand, I myself as a cleric that is ldon/minor time/KT geared have been able to pull out wins that would have been CRs for some a$$-clown cleric that has rode his guild's coat-tails and is Time+ geared.</p>

<p><br />
Zerg (n). Zerging can mean a lot of different things as well. Zerging can be a strategy for a particular encounter, or it can be an entire raid philosophy, or it can simply mean max-dps at a certain time in any given fight. Allow me to clarify: Corinav, the "boss" fight in Plane of Water, is a zerg fight. Once he becomes targetable, the entire raid goes maximum dps to drop him before the timer for the event boots you out. Some guilds, however, use the zerg mentality for every fight. Taking 150+ people to Terris Thule and just throwing people at her with minimal strategy and crushing the encounter with pure numbers when the event could be done with a very skilled and tight raid of 35 people is the most popular, and negative, conotation of the term zerg. It's the reason that GoD in my mind  has so many instanced events that only allow set numbers of people to join in order to progress. Zerging is also used to denote the point in the fight at which all damage classes are supposed to use all of their damage disc and casters fire off their nukes in order to effectively "burn" a target down.</p>

<p><br />
Own or pwn (v). To own, or the hacker bastardization "pwn", is to display obvious dominance over someone/something else. A player can "pwn" another player in terms of gear/AA/etc, or could simply be able to display dominance in a duel format. While your 72-man Time-geared raid could walk into Vex Thal and "pwn" the entire place quite easily, they in turn would probably be "pwned" trying to walk into Txevu without massive planning and leadership to guide them through.</p>

<p>I don't know how your rebuttal fits here. He never said that people who raid are the only ones who take the game seriously. What he said was that loral doesnt take it seriously and does not report on real news/issues. You're putting words in his mouth.</p>

Wow. Kudos on your successful attempt to resort to one of the most infantile and overused cut-downs on the internet - a cut-down that is second only to "newbie." Nice way to generalize the raiding community and associate with being prepubescent teenagers. Although I consider it rather ironic that you did that - considering that people who use that cut-down (usually) are, in fact, prepubescent teenagers themselves. </p>

<p>Hell, you might as well have gone one step further and associated anyone who plays video games online as being nerds with no lives, or 30yr old single computer programmers who still live with their mother. That's basically what you were saying anyway. </p>

<p>You had been pretty mature in your rebuttal to Crisis' comment up until the end; try again next time.</p>

<p> I was referring at that point that he really should not make blanket statements. I did not imply nor did i mean to imply that the reverse was true either</p>

"Give us someone who actually raids and has experienced more then 5% of the content in EQ. Then they might actually have something interesting to say." </p>

<p> again i was attempting to show through exaggeration why his statement was simply stupid. I as well as most people understand at least a few raiders have a job that doesnt require an intimate klnowledge of how long the french fries stay in the grease tank. </p>

<p>My ghod what pointless navel dwelling crap was this?  So basically, your article suggests 'turn everything around and stop using every term that everyone has used to state their issues with Everquest'  eh? And without providing an alternative other then 'clarify'? That's some genius work there pal. </p>

<p>I would like to see an article or review on Omens.  Does it suck as much as LoY or GoD?  How is the lag with then new graphic options? etc..</p>

<p>Expect a review of Omens in the next couple of days.     It is an excellent expansion with open content, lots of single-group content and rewards, some nice new features like voice-macros and tasks, and some excellent graphics.  The graphics will slow down older machines with older video cards but all of the options can be turned off in-game.</p>

<p>I'll post the review as soon as I get it back from my editor.</p>

<p>Mobhunter is not the great website it used to be. Here we are in EQ with one of the biggest news stories this year (Omens released) and we get a fluff piece about EQ terms that most players use.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we have SOE banning players left and right for expressing their opinions on the official SOE forums (a ranger named Ksaintjohns was just banned and was a well rescpted poster). We have rumors that the hybrid experience penalty in in effect in EQ once again. Where is the reporting on these news items?</p>

<p>Honestly I think Loral has been co-opted by SOE ever since he got his invite to the EQ Guild Summit extravaganza along with other "luminaries" like Woody and the elite/uber guild members of EQ. Even Woody this week shut down his EQ Community Involvment forum--probably on the orders of his buddy Brenlo. </p>

<p>So here we have Loral and Woody, two EQ fanboy "peas in a pod" still having access to the exclusive, private SOE EQ Dev forums yet by their actions and ommissions failing to represent the EQ playerbase that they claim to represent. Guys I hope the barbeque, Padres baseball game and other ego stroking ammenities of the EQ Guild Summit were satisfying. As far as I'm concerned your credibility is gone.</p>

<p>I fully admit to being an EQ Phanboi (Thank Tunare for l337) but Woody??  Have you ever read his comics?  He's about as far from a SOE fanboi as you can get.  Let me back this up with some evidence:</p>

<p>Try looking for some evidence before coming up with theories.  Watch out for the black helicoptors, they're everywhere.</p>

<p>I agree with 4 of 5.</p>

<p>Mudflation (when used properly) is actually a very specific description of a certin phenomenon.</p>

<p>In EQ, there is an infinite supply of material wealth into the economy (no matter how many times you kill that mob, they keep spawning with armloads of loot and cash).  There is no attrition (loot never wears out or breaks).</p>

<p>Basically, the longer we play, the more "stuff" gets passed around either as gear or as plat (from vendors who buy our loot).</p>

<p>Mudflation describes the negative side-effects of this infinite-supply situation.</p>

<p>Mudflation implies that there is too much inflation in a multi user dungeon because the economy is imbalanced.</p>
