Verant wants more of your money so they are announcing EverQuest 2 through those ass pirates at PC Lamer--I mean Gamer. How fugging weak! I guess those cacksuggers think we will all just bend over and take it up the pooper one more time. No thanks!<p>There were scans of the article up but the money grubbers at PC Flamer made Rangers Glade take them down. They just want you to fork over your hard-earned money to read the article. How lame! I mean, just cuz they wrote it or whatever! What is this, Russia??<p>I could cut and paste a bunch of stupid game features here to look at, but that would be so lame. Why would I want to inform you of that shit? Nobody is going to play the game anyway. All the &quot;features&quot; are just ripoffs from DAoC and WoW, so I won't waste your time.<p>But are you ready for this shit? You won't be able to transfer your EQ characters to EQ2. OMFG, is that weak or what?? Does Verant honestly expect us to walk away from all the cool shiznit and g34r we outfitted our toons with? No thanks, move along... dillholes.<p>And what is with all those stupid Verant Web sites leading us around by the nads, jerking our chain? I don't know who that cacksugger Nate Pierce thinks he is, but he can kiss my azz. I don't have all day to solve word puzzles and shit like that. Just tell me the info already! Jesus!!<p>Oh, but here's the real dirt for you, cuz that's what we're here for at Mobhunter. I know this guide at Verant (at least he a guide was until the cacksuggers fired him for actually HELPING a fugging customer) and he told me that there is only ONE GUY working on the whole damn EQ2 game! Plus, there is NOBODY working on old EQ anymore! All the patches and shit they do now are just things they've had sitting around for months. All five programmers who work at Verant are stuck on the PS2 project. In fact, odds are good that Verant will CANCEL EQ totally and force you to move to the PS2 game! Is that bullshit or what?<p>I don't know about you, but I'm not going to sit and take this. No way Verant is gonna get me to pay for EQ, EQ2, and the Star Wars game. You can't even play Vader, FFS! OMG Verant, when will you get a clue? Nobody is going to buy a second (or third, or fourth) helping of your shit.<p>Now I gotta go cuz my guild is about to farm for Emperor keys. That l3wt is fugging tight!<p>C ya, lamerz.
