<html><head><title>Let There Be News</title></head><body><h1>Let There Be News</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-03-12</p><BIG>Add Another to the Pay-to-Play Ranks</BIG><p>Over the weekend, our friends at <a href="http://eqlizer.net/index.shtml">EQ'Lizer</a> made the following announcement:<p><B>As some of you may know, EQ'Lizer was almost shut down by our ISP about 2 months ago. Since this happened, we have been actively talking to every banner provider we can to try and locate a consistent source of revenue to pay for the bandwidth used on this site. We have searched high and low, but when we just paid over $ 4,000.00 for this months expenses, the simple truth has hit us pretty hard... there is no banner provider willing to pay enough to even cover the bandwidth charges on this site.<p>EQ'Lizer has the oldest EverQuest item database on the web and we do not want to be forced offline. There are too many people that enjoy this site, and we love running it, especially with all the new features we have been adding recently.<p>In searching for every possible way to cover the costs, we have found only one possible solution. This solution is to join Flashlink and charge a small membership fee to access the information on our site. NOW WAIT!! Before you get all upset, please read the rest of this and actually understand what it means. We had two choices, add Flashlink to the site, or take the site offline. Would you really rather see EQ'Lizer completely offline, or contribute less than the cost of a single cup of fancy coffee to help us stay around?</B><p>Here at the Mobhunter offices, we feel EQ'Lizer's pain. See, bandwidth costs money. Everytime you read a story or look at a picture online, someone has to pay for it. In the case of Mobhunter, we rob banks and mug the elderly to raise the funds necessary to keep our site running (okay, we don't really rob banks). But with all the images and content that EQ'Lizer pumps out, they have to be looking at some serious cash.<p>Anyway, pay the damn <a href="http://www.flashlink.com/index.php?p=signup&amp;s=57">Flashlink</a> fee (only $25 if you buy a full year) and keep on enjoying EQ'Lizer, <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/">EQ Maps</a>, and <a href="http://www.eqprices.com/">EQ Prices</a>. It's a good deal, and you help keep these EverQuest fanatics in business. That's win-win for ya, buddy.<p><BIG>Everybody Must Get Stoned</BIG><p>Remember the good ol' manastone? It was a nifty little treasure out of Guk that allowed any caster to convert hit points into mana. Somewhere along the line, Verant realized how overpowering this sucker was, and made it stop dropping. Then they made it not work in the planes. Then they made it only work in the Old World (Antonica, Faydwer, Odus).<p>So what's the point of this story? Well, part of the redesign of the Cazic-Thule zone was to make the manastone stop working there. Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000513.html">responded</a> to a player's concern as to why this change was made:<p><B>While we all understand that there was an implication that we'd let manastones continue to work in the old world, the new Temple of Cazic-Thule is basically a new world zone. It's a zone designed for the same high end people and content that we think manastones break. And, well, it seems to me to be a better idea to make a good zone than to worry about one &quot;crazy broken&quot; item.</B><p>Hey, I like minimizing downtime as much as the next guy. But given the hit point totals possible today, as well as the healing spells players can cast, even the ardent naysayer has to admit that the manastone would be unbalancing. If Verant allowed it to work in high-end zones, they'd have to design the content assuming everyone had manastones.<p>Hey, come to think of it, maybe they think everyone who wants to kill Vulak has an operable manastone. Makes you wonder...<p><BIG>Like School in Summertime--No Class</BIG><p>A player from my own home server of Xev <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000516.html">asked Verant</a> why the previously druid-only Rowyls Armguards have been made usable by those nasty clerics and shamans. First Rich Waters responded:<p><B>Class specific items are good in cases where they are not going to be No Drop. When they can't be traded, it's often a very frustrating situation if you have no one present who can use the item in question. Having an item that your group earned and no one can use is very annoying, as you put in the appropriate effort and the reward rots on the corpse.<p>The Rowyl's Armguards are a good example. The item was changed because that's a case where 45 or more people participate in an event and on some servers the armguards were beginning to rot as the guild druids all acquired the item. Making the armguards useful to more classes lengthens the amount that can drop before a given group becomes saturated with them.</B><p>Then Absor himself added:<p><B>Lawrence Poe (not worthy of a full quote...  ) mentioned the revamp of Hate Plane and how the class-specific loot their [sic] wasn't so well received. Both make very good points. Obviously no decision on such things is going to be able to please everyone. But we'll continue to do our best to make the decisions that work out best for the game.</B><p>I can't let the latter comment go without saying something. Why doesn't anyone kill Innoruuk up in Hate? Aside from clearing to get to him, the fight itself is pretty fun. Hint: It's not because the loot is class-specific (it's race-specific, in any case); it's because the loot sucks. That's right, aside from the gnome item really, Inny's loot is crap. Give him <I>good</I> class-specific or race-specific items and people will gladly kill him. As it is now, he's the one ubermob you can always count on to be up--even though you're guaranteed not to care.<p><BIG>You Guys Owe Me 32,453,982 Points of Back-Mana</BIG><p>Casters, rejoice! If you liked the fact that the enchanter's Glamour of Kintaz had its mana cost reduced, you'll love <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000509.html">Absor's spell news</a>:<p><B>You'll probably see a lot of changes like that. Some of them will trickle in and some will come in bigger chunks.</B><p>Word is that Complete Heal will have its mana cost reduced to 10. However, to balance this, the casting time has been increased to 27 minutes.<p>You win some, you lose some.<p><BIG>Oops, I Did It Again</BIG><p>And finally, from the Correction Department, we have Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000514.html">clarifying an error</a> he made when talking about mages:<p><B>I have an update, rather a correction, on one of the answers to the questions that the Mage Compendium folks sent in.<p>I was just informed by Scott Hartsman that I made a mistake about the pet experience thing. <I>Pets only take experience from a group if they outdamage the entire group.</I> If they do, then they gain a share as if they were a group member. If they do not, they take no experience at all.<p>This is how it's been working the whole time, and it makes a lot more sense. I'm sorry for the mistake.</B><p>Gosh, all you people who rail on Absor and Abashi for never admitting when they make a mistake might want to come up with a better argument. &quot;Uh, well, they only lie about the really IMPORTANT stuff!&quot; Okay, whatever.<p><BIG>And on a Personal Note...</BIG><p>Over the weekend we moved Mobhunter to a larger, faster server. We think everything is working fine, but if you run into any problems, <a href="mailto:kohath@mobhunter.com">let Kohath know</a>. Thanks! That'll be $39.99, please.
