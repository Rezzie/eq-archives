Its spell parameter was Positive, indicating that the spell attempts to Heal over Time instead of Damage over Time. Tomorrow's patch is likely to implement this fix, reverting the spell to a DoT.<p>Mesmerize Change <p>* All Spells with the Mesmerize Effect&nbsp;have had their parameter changed from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;2&quot;. This may change the nature or behaviour of the Mesmerize series of spells -- perhaps it will take 2 attacks before the Mez will break, but that's only a guess at this time. <p>Paladin Luclin Spell Changes <p>* Valor of Marr&nbsp;(Pal 52) Upgraded from 120% Haste to 125%. <br>* Thunder of Karana&nbsp;(Pal 49) Has had its 1-second Stun component removed. This should reduce the resistability of the spell. <br>* Words of Conviction was renamed to&nbsp;Quelious' Words of Tranquility&nbsp;(Pal 54). 108-hp Heal changed to 108 Direct Damage. <br>* Unyielding Resilience was renamed to&nbsp;Breath of Tunare&nbsp;(Pal 56), otherwise unchanged. <br>* Nife's Touch was renamed to&nbsp;Healing Wave of Prexus&nbsp;(Pal 58), otherwise unchanged. <br>* Crusader's Protection was renamed to&nbsp;Brell's Mountainous Barrier&nbsp;(Pal 60), otherwise unchanged. <br>* Gnomercy&nbsp;(Pal 60) was added -- probably an inside joke among the testers. Turns the caster (Paladin) into a Gnome.</B><p>Ah, the advent of the gnomish paladins... a sight to behold, I&quot;m sure. Too bad it will never see the live servers. I'd pay good money for an all/all weapon with that proc.<p>I'm not sure what the fix to the shaman epic will do. One would hope for an increase in effectiveness, but with the state of the game today you can never be too sure. Likewise, any change to a mez spell makes me nervous as all get-out. As if enchanters need any more trauma in their fragile lives.<p>Those paladin spells will see a lot of tweaking in the months to come, just like the spells for every other class. They seem to generally be moving in the right direction, though. A healing spell was changed to direct damage, perhaps to appease the cries of the melee challenged.<p>In any case, tomorrow's patch is beginning to sound a bit more interesting.
