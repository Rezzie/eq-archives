Mobhunter.com was conceived by two bored programmers and a bored writer who are EverQuest-obsessed freaks like the rest of you. While we enjoy (or tolerate) many of the existing EQ news sites, we never found one that combined the useful information of the official Verant message boards, interesting tidbits from class-specific message boards, and intelligent rants in quite the way we wanted to see it.<p>So, we made this site.<p>We also wanted to provide a place to track your character data and interact with other players. Part of this functionality is in place now, and part of it is upcoming.<p>If you've just come here to read articles, you might not be aware of some of the features available to you right now:<p><B> - Threaded Message Boards</B>--Each article you read has a <b>Reply to this Article</b> link at the bottom. From here you can start a threaded discussion that stays linked to the story itself. If someone else has started a thread, you can read and respond to the messages by clicking on the thread links.<p><B> - Character Registration</B>--If you haven't registered for Mobhunter, you see the option to <B>Login</B> or <B>Register</B> in the upper left corner of the site. Registering for Mobhunter won't land you on any spam mailing lists--Mobhunter <b>will never</b> give out e-mail addresses to anyone, period. Registering simply allows you to add your EQ character data to our site. This allows you to post messages and submit articles under the name of the character(s) you register. We will be adding more functionality to this feature in the near future (see below).<p><B> - Submit Articles and Links</B>--You get to be more than just a passive reader on Mobhunter. Using the links on the left menu, you can submit articles or links to other sites that we will evaluate. If it's newsworthy, well-written, and accurate, we'll post your story. If your link is useful to the EQ community and offers something not covered in our other links, we'll add it to our site.<p>Upcoming changes to the Mobhunter site:<p><B> - Enhanced Character Management</B>--You will have the ability to enter the items your character wears/uses, as well as stats, resistances, etc. This info will be viewable by other players in a printable character sheet format. You will also be able to send private messages to other registered users without knowing or revealing e-mail addresses.<p><B> - Guild Management &amp; Home Page</B>--Guild leaders will be able to register their guilds on Mobhunter and will be able to add registered users to your roster. Guild leaders and designated members will be able to customize a home page for their guild that members will see as they enter the Mobhunter site. You will be able to combine Mobhunter articles with guild news, artcles, and announcements. You will be able to customize many levels of security so you can decide what content is public and what is private.<p><B> - Expanded Message Boards</b>--We know that message boards about EverQuest are almost as popular and time-consuming as the game itself. Since our message board software was written 100% by us, we can add whatever functionality we want, and--more importantly--what you want. We intend to allow quick access to message threads so you can see them independently from the articles that inspire them.<p>There's much, much more we've talked about doing, but these are realistic goals in the coming months, so that's what we'll stick with for now.<p>Thanks for visiting Mobhunter. We hope you'll enjoy becoming a member of our community.<p>If you have any input on how we can improve our site, send us mail at <a href="mailto:suggestions@mobhunter.com">suggestions@mobhunter.com</a>. We look forward to your feedback.
