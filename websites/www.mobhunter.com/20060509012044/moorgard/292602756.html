<html><head><title>The Urinal</title></head><body><h1>The Urinal</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-01-20</p>At first glance, the men's room in a typical American office building seems an innocuous place. It not only provides the necessary venue for male excretory functions, it can be an escape, a place of refuge from the rigors of the daily corporate routine. Whatever their station on the company ladder, all men are made equal by the restroom.<p>And yet, there are customs and rules that must be observed in the use of restrooms, just as there are in any ritual of modern life. It is these customs and rules that we shall examine today.<p>The only feature really unique to the male restroom over the female version is, of course, the urinal. For those women reading this piece that might not have ever entered a men's room, a urinal is a porcelain receptacle that typically hangs on the wall, allowing the male to urinate while standing. In most modern restrooms, urinals are individual entities, though it was not uncommon in the past (and is still the case in some bars and taverns) for there to be a single long trough which men stood in front of to relieve themselves.<p>Depending on the size of the restroom, urinals are typically spaced a safe distance apart from each other, sometimes with a small divider projecting out from the wall in order to afford some small level of privacy. While at the urinal, males are expected to face forward, looking straight ahead. In some restaurants and bars, advertising is placed at eye level to give men something to read while urinating; most of the time, however, males stare at a blank wall.<p>It is here that the most sacred and cardinal rule of the men's room is established: Glancing sideways at other men urinating is strictly forbidden.  Despite what you may think, this is not due to a fear of homosexual advances. Rather, it is based primarily on a reluctance to compare the size of one's manhood with that of another male. This principle is, in turn, based on every man's desire to perceive himself as being at least average in size, and of course seeing another man of larger proportions (outside of pornographic films, which as we all know don't count) shatters that illusion. But this is really a subject for another discussion.<p>Any form of dialogue is discouraged at the urinal--unless, of course, the two men walked into the restroom together talking, in which case their vocalization is merely a means to overlook the fact that they are in a room together holding their respective genitals. But under no circumstances should a conversation ever <I>start</I> in the bathroom, for doing so shatters the solitude that some seek upon entering.<p>If there are three or more urinals in a bathroom that is unoccupied, the first man in the restroom should take the urinal on either end. This allows the next man entering the restroom to take a urinal at least one space away from the first person. <B>Under no circumstances should the second man take the urinal that is right next to the first man.</B> This is nearly as bad as looking sideways while your neighbor urinates. The <I>only</I> circumstance where it is permitted to stand at a urinal right next to someone else is when, as in a restroom with three urinals, A and C are occupied and so B must be used.<p>(Please note: It is also acceptable, in a situation as described above, for the third man to opt to relieve himself in a stall instead of taking the center urinal. The downside is that there is a slight implication of a feeling of inferiority, and so it is much better for the third visitor to take the center urinal if possible.)<p>We must, at this juncture, mention an unfortunate phenomenon that sometimes occurs in a densely populated men's room: an inability to perform the urinary function, commonly known as &quot;stage fright.&quot; Some men suffer from this chronically, others only occasionally, but regardless of the frequency, this problem alters the entire atmosphere of the room. This is especially the case when more than one male is stricken by the condition at a given time--the deafening silence at the urinals tends to feed the problem and only makes it worse.<p>A common (and unfortunate) attempt to resolve the situation is for the male to try to force the urine out. This usually results in pulses of urine rather than a steady stream, which stands out even more than silence. In fact, this attempt to squeeze the waste out can often cause loud, embarassing gaseous emissions to be released at the same time, only increasing the discomfort of the situation.<p>The proper response to stage fright is to ignore it. Pretend that you have urinated, collect yourself, wash your hands, and leave the restroom quickly. Nothing will be said about the matter. This is an especially kind gesture if the other party involved chooses to remain at the urinal after you leave. In this situation, civility is expected; depart the washroom hastily so the other party may recover his dignity. You never know when you may need someone else to show you the same kindness.<p>While urinals are designed for ease and comfort, one unfortunate aspect of their implementation is urinal puddling. The problem begins when one careless individual either misdirects his flow or underestimates the amount of dribble he produces at the end of his release. This causes a small puddle to form on the floor beneath the urinal. The matter becomes compounded, however, as the next person after him increases his distance from the receptacle slightly so as to avoid the puddle, which in turn produces further dribble that adds to the pool of urine. This creep-back effect will increase with each subsequent user, causing the puddle to increase exponentially until the floor is cleaned. Without frequent janitorial visits, the average corporate restroom would soon devolve into chaos.<p>Having worked in office buildings of various sizes, I have found there to be a large variance in how frequently men choose to visit the restroom. Personally, I tend to go quite often, even if I have little urge to urinate. I find the solace of an empty restroom to be quite comforting. Others, of course, wait to use the facilities until absolutely necessary. These people I refer to as &quot;the coffee pot men.&quot;<p>Allow me to explain. I worked in one office that shared a men's room with a company that did stock trading. These day traders were encouraged to stay at their computers and on the phone as much as possible; after all, this was how they made their money. As such, bathroom time for these people was extremely limited. They would wait until their bladders were near bursting, then rush into the restroom, stride up to the urinal, and unleash a veritable torrent of urine that sprayed loudly into the small amount of water that resides in the basin. The sound reminds me of someone pouring out a full pot of coffee all at once--hence the term above. The day traders would then bolt out of the bathroom, usually without washing their hands. Day traders are truly disgusting, on many levels.<p>(Another aside, if you will. While once providing a urine sample for an annual physical, a nurse explained that healthy urine should be light in color rather than dark yellow. &quot;Holding it in&quot; results in more concentrated urine that is darker, but doing so may cause the buildup of minerals in the bladder that can manifest themselves as stones later in life, which I'm told are extremely painful. As such, I have committed myself to the path of drinking lots of water and urinating frequently, thus hopefully keeping my system free of long-term contaminants.)<p>The final step in the urinary process is, as you might imagine, the zip-up. This is the only stage of the bathroom sequence where looking down at your own genitals is universally acceptable. While it is certainly admirable for a man to shake off, retract his privates, and zip his pants without looking, the risk inherent in an unsuccessful zip makes a glance down quite understandable. Realize, however, that excessive shaking and/or looking down will be regarded as extremely suspect, so tread carefully.<p><I>In part two of our look at corporate American restroom culture, we will examine rituals associated with the other primary feature of the men's room: the stall.</I>
