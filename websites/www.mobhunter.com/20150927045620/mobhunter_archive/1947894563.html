The quest involves getting ten things, combining them with another couple things, giving that to somebody and getting something else, and combining that with another thing or two (apologies if you don't like spoilers).<p>Anyway, Triton has about 26 keys so far, and went for a look around the zone, even getting a decent piece of loot off a minor boss. If profanity-laden Web sites aren't your thing, you can check out the screen shots (<a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/images/news/may12/vt3full.jpg">1</a> <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/images/news/may12/vt1full.jpg">2</a> <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/images/news/may12/vt2full.jpg">3</a> <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/images/news/may12/vt4full.jpg">4</a>) here. It seems like a neat zone, and we anticipate boatloads of screen shots and and uberloot to come.<p><BIG>You're Bound to Like It</BIG><p>Apparently casters can once again <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/editorials/tp">bind</a> in Timorous Deep, which has them <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11037.topic">excited</a>. Why? Because they can make use of the legendary firepot room, which gives insta-click access to the old world's major cities, as well as Cabilis. Pre-Luclin this feature was very handy indeed--which was probably why Verant disallowed binding in the zone. Since the majority of people stay bound in the Nexus/Bazaar area now, Timorous binding isn't much of an issue.<p>This does nothing for melee, of course, unless you happen to have obtained a Locket of Escape before it stopped dropping--assuming you didn't use it to bind yourself in Plane of Mischief. The Locket gives melee a single-cast spell that allows them to bind in places that only casters normally can, but this item was apparently judged as unbalancing. Though, given the changes in attitude with the new Verant regime, perhaps we'll see this effect resurface elsewhere.<p><BIG>Kane You Dig It?</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000576.html">updated</a> everyone on the status of the second local European server, Kane Bayle:<p><B>Well, here's the scoop.<p>We plan to bring the server Live on the 15th of May, 2002. In an attempt to keep the login flooding to a minimum, I'm not going to announce the exact time that it will open.<p>Also, we're going to make this a non-split server.<p>Some of you are going to be very happy about that decision, others not so much so. We understand the desires of folks on either side of this discussion, but we feel that a fresh server is more appropriate. Antonious Bayle was a split server and that went well. But we heard some concerns that it isn't really a server 'built' in Europe, that because characters moved to the server it doesn't have the same feel that a server might have if characters were built from opening day in the community. So we're going to open Kane Bayle a fresh server.</B><p>Logical, I guess, but I know some people were looking forward to the chance to movelog to a new server. While older servers like Veeshan and Karana might have populations within Verant's target range, &quot;crowded&quot; is still a relative term. If your guild can't find targets to kill that are within its ability, then your server is, by my definition, crowded.<p>So, is <I>anybody's</I> server not crowded?<p><BIG>It's Even Better Boiled with Beef</BIG><p>A druid has finally <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1402.topic">finished the quest</a> for the Protection of the Cabbage spell--which is basically a single-target version of Protection of the Glades for less mana. The spell itself is fine, as it will save druids mana in some situations, and the quest also provides a decent earring.<p>All of which you'd think would make druids happy... but they <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showMessage?topicID=663.topic">aren't</a>, exactly. The quest ends up being very, very costly in terms of items needed and time spent, and some rather high tradeskill levels are required for success. In other words, it can cost about $16K plat and days of work to obtain a spell that is sort of a sub-set of another that drops for free.<p>Don't get me wrong--quested spells are cool, even if they take a while to get. But the pricetag on this one does seem rather steep for the results given. And btw, getting tradeskill failures when doing quests sucks bigtime.<p><BIG>Might As Well Get EQ3 While You're at It</BIG><p>EB Games is letting you pre-order EverQuest 2 now, but we won't provide you a link to do so quite yet. Why not? Because we think it's questionable for a company to allow you to put money down on a game that doesn't have a firm release date and that might, like it or not, never materialize (UO2, anyone?). Hey, we're as excited about the new game as everyone else, but we'll hold on to our cash for now, just in case.<p>If you're itchy to order something, how about getting Planes of Power through one of our links on the left there? Or you could order <a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/more/332.php">DAoC 1.5</a>--oh, waitaminute, that's just a bunch of bug fixes and filler packaged as some kind of upgrade, and they give it to you for free anyway. So nevermind that part.<p><BIG>Graphics Competition Heats Up</BIG><p>The days of nVidia and ATI having a stranglehold on the video card market may be in jeopardy. Last week 3DLabs announced its P10 chip, which, according to their press release, will offer the following:<p><B>Gaming enthusiasts are anticipated to find VPU versions that lead in next-generation DirectX shader performance, enhancing this Christmas season's must-have titles.</B><p>Not to be outdone, Matrox is <a href="http://www.matrox.com/mga/">teasing</a> that they will announce their new Parhelia graphics card tomorrow. Besides the prerequisite blazing speed and a goofy-ass name, Kohath claims it will have a fancy three-screen panoramic mode.<p>Regardless of how these new cards will do in the market, competition is a good thing. Hopefuly it will push nVidia and ATI harder to make faster, cheaper products that will take DirectX 8 (and beyond) games to their limit.<p>Hey, I want EQ2 to look it's best. Doesn't matter to me who makes the card that does it.
