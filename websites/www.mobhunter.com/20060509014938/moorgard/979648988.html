But what the heck.<p>Let us assume for the moment that we were going to have separate titles for male and female characters post 50th level. What would you suggest?<p>Let's toss in a few rules to make this easy.<p>The 51-54th level title will be a one-size-fits-all title, to help reduce the number of acceptable names we need. The 55-59th title and the 60th title will require both a masculine and feminine version of the same title, not completely separate title. So witch and warlock might work, where warlock and sorceress would not. (Though I am would be tempted to leave the Monk ones as they are, in a way I can't see Monks distinguishing their masters by sex like that...)<p>Some titles are reserved (though I don't know all of them), such as Lord and Lady, because they are used as special rewards.<br> <br>Let me list the current titles:<p>BARD - Minstrel - Troubadour - Virtuoso<br>CLERIC - Vicar - Templar - High Priest<br>DRUID - Wanderer - Preserver - Heirophant<br>ENCHANTER - Illusionist - Beguiler - Phantasmist<br>MAGICIAN - Elementalist - Conjurer - Arch Mage<br>MONK - Disciple - Master - Grandmaster<br>NECROMANCER - Heretic - Defiler - Warlock<br>PALADIN - Cavalier - Knight - Crusader<br>RANGER - Pathfinder - Outrider - Warder<br>ROGUE - Rake - Blackguard - Assassin<br>SHADOWKNIGHT - Reaver - Revenant - Grave Lord<br>SHAMAN - Mystic - Luminary - Oracle<br>WARRIOR - Champion - Myrmidon - Warlord<br>WIZARD - Channeler - Evoker - Sorcerer<p>The other possibility would be to just replace the masculine titles with others, so send in proposals about that too.<p>But keep in mind that I'm doing this before talking with the team about possibilities for making changes, so nothing may come of it. If you don't want to send in suggestions that might have no chance of seeing the light of day, then don't send them in. <p>Also, please keep in mind that we have to worry about titles that are directly connected with real life groups. We don't want to offend...<p>Alan</B><p>Well, technically, there aren't a lot of gender-specific titles there, but a few could be changed for the sake of the ladies. The level 60 cleric should be &quot;High Priestess;&quot; as the poster suggested, level 60 necros should be &quot;Witch;&quot; and 60 shadowknights should be &quot;Grave Lady,&quot; or another title should be created.<p>Others aren't so easy to pin down. The level 60 warrior, &quot;Warlord,&quot; is masculine, but you don't want to say &quot;Warlady.&quot; And despite what Absor said, &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Grandmaster&quot; are also masculine, but calling the ladies &quot;Mistress&quot; and &quot;Grandmistress&quot; would be going down a slippery slope indeed.<br> <br>All in all, Absor should have probably just left this one alone.
