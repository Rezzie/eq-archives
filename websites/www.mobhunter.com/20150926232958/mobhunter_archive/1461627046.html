<html><head><title>Kill Thy Neighbor</title></head><body><h1>Kill Thy Neighbor</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-07-20</p>Check out the new PvP <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">stats page</a> for the Sullon Zek server. It shows which players have the most kill points, and how the kills per team stack up overall.<p>If you need an explanation of how points are calculated, there's an <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000230.html">explanation</a> on the EQ boards.<p>At a glance, SZ looks like a tough place to be a good guy. But then again, evil isn't exactly dominant either. It's those pesky neutrals (even more reason not to trust Halflings) who are stacking up killshots like cord wood.<p>In all fairness, people do seem to be enjoying life on Sullon. Maybe it's the repressed Quake tendencies that EQ addiction has forced players to keep buried for two years. Whatever the case, Verant has obviously made PvP a lot more interesting and enjoyable.<p>Just please, give us carebear server junkies some attention, too.
