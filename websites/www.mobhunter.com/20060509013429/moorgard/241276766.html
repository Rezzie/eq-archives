While the content itself is terrific, the fancy eye candy can bog down even the hardiest of computer systems. Fortunately, several fixes and system tweaks have surfaced since the game's release that allow you to squeeze more performance out of your hardware. In some cases, the difference is quite dramatic.<p>Please note that while all the tweaks listed below have been proven to be helpful to some people, they may not work for you. Be sure you make a backup of any files you edit, in case you mistype something and end up making things worse. Backups are a good thing!<p><B>DirectX and Video/Sound Drivers</B><p>Before you even install Luclin, make sure you have <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/">version 8.1</a> of DirectX from Microsoft. While Absor stated once upon a time that version 8.0 should work just fine, it has been proven by numerous people that you really need 8.1 for your system to be happy.<p>After DirectX 8.1 is up and running, install the latest verson of your sound and video drivers. Actually, for video drivers it is often better to use the most stable version rather than the latest, and for pity's sake don't use any beta versions. Verant provides a <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/compatability_matrix.jsp">list of drivers</a>, or you can check out the links at <a href="http://www.reactorcritical.com/download.shtml">Reactor Critical</a>.<p><B>AGP Aperture Size</B><p>When I first bought Luclin, I began experiencing complete system lock-ups starting about 15 seconds after initially entering the game. I think my record for playing the game without crashing was about 45 seconds.<p>Fortunately, I remembered a system tweak that a guildmate had recommended. In your computer's BIOS (the little program that controls a lot of your computer's hardware settings, accessible when you boot up your machine, usually by hitting the [Delete] key) there should be a setting called AGP Aperture Size. The folks at Tweak3D.net have an <a href="http://www.tweak3d.net/tweak/boot/">explanation</a> of this feature and a suggestion for how to set your value: <p><B>This number will set the maximum amount of memory that can be accessed by the AGP graphics card. It is recommended that you set this to 1/4 or 1/2 of your total system memory, unless instructed otherwise by your graphics card manual.</B><p>You might play around with it a bit. If you have 512 MB of RAM, I'd say the higher the value, the better.<p><B>Note:</B> Not to scare you or anything, but it's very important that you do not mess around too much in your BIOS unless you know precisely what you're doing. If you make some change you're not sure about, don't worry; you can quit without saving and start over.<p><B>Swap File Usage</B><p>If you use Windows 98 or ME, your system isn't using its RAM the way Luclin would like it to (assuming you have 128 MB or more RAM, which of course you should). <p>A potentially huge performance gain can be had by editing your system.ini file, which is found in your Windows directory. You can open this with Notepad or another pure text editor--don't use Word or a fancy word processor, though.<p>After you open the file, scroll down until you find the [386Enh] section, and add the following line: ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1<p>Once again, I'll refer to Tweak3D.net's <a href="http://www.tweak3d.net/tweak/hdnew/4.shtml">description</a> of what this change does:<p><B>This tweak disables the 'PageFile_Call_Async_Manager', which allows Windows to write out the swap during an idle in the Vfat. In other words, Windows will attempt to use your physical RAM as much as possible, and only write to the swapfile when the hard drive isn't busy.</B><p>This trick made my zoning times decrease dramatically, and boosted performance overall.<p><B>Sound Fix</B><p>Luclin players have reported many types of sound problems, including distorted and muffled sounds in many zones. These issues seem to plague Creative's Soundblaster line of cards in particular.<p>It turns out that your sound card may be dragging down your entire system's performance. DirectX leaves your sound card in debug mode, which is a huge drain on your CPU. To fix this, download the <a href="http://www.gamevoiceclub.com/Download/dxapplet.zip">DirectX Control Panel Applet</a> and extract it to your WindowsSystem directory. Go into your Control Panel and run the applet. Under the DirectSound tab, move the debug slider all the way to the left. After you apply this change, reboot to make it active.<p>On my system, this change has made a <B>huge</B> difference. Not only are some sounds clearer, but frame rates have improved dramatically. In fact, my system (1ghz AMD Athlon, 512 RAM, GeForce 3) was performing the same--<B>or worse</B>--than Kohath's system (800mhz Athlon, 256 RAM, Voodoo 5). This fact caused me real physical sickness. After running the fix, my performance leapt ahead of Kohath's, and I was able to sleep at night.<p>Your mileage may vary depending on what sound card you have, but the change is worth making regardless of your setup.<p><B>Character Models</B><p>No one wants to disable the coolest features of your shiny new expansion, but the fact is that the biggest drain on your system is all those new character models Luclin has added. Polygon counts per character have gone from the hundreds into the thousands, and each time a new character model comes into view your system will probably stutter a bit while the textures are loaded. The easiest way to lighten the burden is to not load all the character models.<p>Fortunately, Luclin allows you to set exactly which models are loaded (via the &quot;Options&quot; screen on the same menu that allows you to &quot;Connect&quot;). You can pick models based on race and sex; any that you deselect will default to the old character models.<p>While I stubbornly refuse to disable most new models, I have gotten rid of ogre female, troll female, and dwarf female (three race/sex combos you rarely see, aside from NPCs in their starting towns). There are a couple other models I would consider axing, but before you go hog wild, consider the plight of readers like Quaras Shadowscythe:<p><B>After thinking about this for a bit, I realized, that those of us who favor some of the less popular player characters (or new player characters that have less attractive models) were somewhat out of luck.  Most other players would turn off the character models for halflings (perhaps with reason) and would never see my new beard or hair or eye color.  Standing at the Luclin spire, I then realized that there was no reason for me to buy a horse.  As the new Luclin models have to be on in order to enable high end graphics, even if I spent my carefully hoarded cash on a small pony, it was likely that less than 5% of the player base would ever get to see it!</B><p>Another thing to keep in mind: if you change your new face from the default that Verant assigned to you in Luclin, people with your race/sex model disabled will see a different face than the one you had pre-Luclin. This is because new faces are tied to specific old ones (Verant supposedly tried to make new faces that were similar to the old ones, but they were way off the mark in many cases). That's even more disheartening for people like Quaras, I'm sure.<p>While the suggestions above aren't guaranteed to make Luclin run as smoothly as you'd like, most if not all of them should have a significant impact on making your gaming experience an enjoyable one.<p>Good luck, and welcome to the moon!
