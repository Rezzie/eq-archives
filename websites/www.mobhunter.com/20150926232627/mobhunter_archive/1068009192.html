<html><head><title>Here We Go Again...</title></head><body><h1>Here We Go Again...</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-09-17</p>Afterlife posted some nice <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=kerafyrm">pictures</a> of the Sleeper's awakening and its aftermath.<p>We finally know what Vox had to say about her hero's newfound freedom: &quot;The Sleeper stirs! A glorious new age for Norrath is about to begin, and my exile is about to end!&quot;<p>Furthermore, some inhabitants of Skyshrine actually shout warnings to those in the zone that the Sleeper is on his way. From the look of the screenshots, though, not a lot of people took advantage of the advice.<p>Aw, who am I kidding... if I had a shot at seeing Kerafyrm go on a rampage, I'd be willing to lose exp too.<p>In any case, Afterlife is catching a bit of <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/fafterlife68829afterlifemessageboard.showMessage?topicID=3492.topic">heat</a> from the other citizens of Mithaniel Marr server. It seems some people aren't real happy about the best source of primal drying up, since when the Sleeper goes wandering, the warders don't come back--at least until the quest that returns the Sleeper to his dome is completed. Then again, some are saying that one of the changes that happens when the warders go away is that the spawn time on the golems in ST increases greatly, as does their chance to drop primal. So making the warders go away may not be so bad for other guilds after all.<p>This topic is so hot that it drew in members of <a href="http://www.noows.com">Fires of Heaven</a> and <a href="http://www.drow.org">Blood of the Spider</a> to comment on it.<p>So is waking the Sleeper right or wrong? Is it selfish of a guild to play the game as Verant has designed it just because doing so inconveniences other guilds?<p>Some things in this game just <a href="http://sites.netscape.net/mlruwoldt">don't make sense</a>, but it's hard to fault a guild for playing by the rules and having <a href="http://www.jps.net/emorrison/Oouz.gif">fun</a>.<p>Unless, of course, it happens on your server.
