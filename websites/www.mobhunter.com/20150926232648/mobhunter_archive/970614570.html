Over on the EQLive site, they've announced the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/eqim.jsp">EverQuest Instant Messaging Service</a>. Unlike the multitude of other instant messengers, EQIM uses the EQ Chat server to allow you to create and enter chat rooms without loading the game client. It also seems to let you &quot;log in&quot; to the server of your choice and communicate with people in groups or in guildchat. The specifics on how you will show up to people who are in the world at the time aren't clear.<p>And of course, like every other IM client in the world, this one is fr... oh, wait a second. They're going to charge for this puppy, unless you're a Legends subscriber. The cost isn't disclosed yet, but there will be a free trial period first to try and get you hooked.<p>I admit, being able to sit at work and &quot;log in&quot; to the game would be kinda neat. It would also be a handy way for people on the road with a laptop that can't handle EQ to check in with their friends and listen in on a raid or whatever.<p>The natural reaction of many would be to say &quot;OMG it's another VI scam! This should be free!&quot; Certainly I'd be a big fan of EQIM if it didn't cost anything, as the features are kinda slick. Personally, I think this will be a hard sell, even if it only costs a couple dollars a month. Considering that many people find a way to sit on AIM or ICQ at the same time they're in game, it's not like the someone outside the game doesn't have any way to communicate with friends in Norrath.<p>The other big question is whether the EQIM client will only be available for the PC, or if there will be Mac and Linux versions as well. For poor bastards like me who have to work on a Mac all day long, this service wouldn't even be a consideration if we couldn't run the client. The EQLive page doesn't say whether other platforms will be supported, but it seems to me that it would be a huge mistake for Verant not to do so.<p>So no, this isn't a scam, and no, it's not that big a deal either. It's a good idea, but its success depends entirely on how well Verant supports it--and how much it costs.<p>In other SOE news, you can apply online for the <a href="http://planetside.station.sony.com/">PlanetSide beta</a>. This game is billed as &quot;the world's first massively multiplayer online first-person shooter&quot;--Quake meets EverQuest, I guess. You have characters, classes, armor/weapons, etc... and you blow stuff up. That's about all I know, really.<p><BIG>Slow Ride, Take It Easy</BIG><p>Over at the Crucible, shamans are a bit concerned over <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=897183643f93efa1f3932850f07ce15d&amp;threadid=7310">problems slowing some mobs</a> in the new planes. While slows seem to be landing, they aren't having any effect on the mob's attack speed. Some see this happening with boss mobs, though others are reporting it randomly on common creatures as well.<p>One theory is that Verant introduced a &quot;slow cap&quot; with PoP. Rather than the old system of having mobs slowable by magic (75%), disease (25%, now 40%), or not at all, they might be trying to make mobs slowable--but only to an extent. That is, they don't want a mob to be immune to magic, but they don't want it to be slowed by the full amount, either. Whether this is really the case or if some mobs are simply bugged, however, remains to be seen.<p>Shamans feel threatened, of course, because slowing mobs is a big part of what they do. They feel that if a mob can only be slowed a bit, then beastlords and rangers can be just as effective at slowing as they are. And I think they have a point there.<p>The best solution--if Verant is indeed experimenting with a &quot;slow cap&quot;--is to modify it so that slows can only land for a portion of their value. That is, say a mob has a 50% slow cap, then a 75% slow would only land for 37.5%, a 40% slow would land for 20%, etc. This would preserve shamans (and enchanters) as the best slowers, while still allowing Verant to make mobs have high DPS in the new style of PoP encounters. The balance between the slowing classes would thus be maintained, and unwashed shamans wouldn't need to get so grumpy.<p><BIG>Where's the Beef?</BIG><p>The gods in the new planes are falling, one by one. It's always fun to read about the newest ubermobs dying, because you get to see the fancy new loot that drops.<p>That's how it works, right?<p>Well, worries about itemization in PoP aren't being helped by what we're seeing so far. Over on Mithaniel Marr, <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">Afterlife</a> dropped their server's namesake and were rewarded with loot that can only be described as &quot;craptastic.&quot; Similarly, the Seventh Hammer didn't give up anything much better. Over on Veeshan, <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/html/index.php">Fires of Heaven</a> has seen some suspect loot from the tier one and tier two gods as well.<p>How long until we see the really good stuff? Maybe the truly uber gear won't be dropping until the deeper planes, when we see Sol Ro and the Zek twins taken to school. But right now, only a small percentage of the PoP loot is in the same league as stuff from NToV--which makes us a bit concerned. But as I've said before: as long as encounters in the planes stay fun and challenging, and things actually work and stay regularly bug free, there won't be that much bitching about loot quailty. But this will only last so long before the huddled masses cry out for loot that's worthy of the effort put in.<p><BIG>Down the Tubes?</BIG><p>Over on Graffe's boards, Rombus of Triton posted a <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=22467.topic">very long thread</a> about the state of message board communities in EQ right now. He talked about things such as the way people who try to present balanced and rational takes on game changes are often attacked, and how even the hint that Verant might have made the right decision on a game nerf gets such posters called &quot;fanboys&quot; and worse (like, say, VAK for instance). Further, he goes on to talk about how higher-level players often get told that they are out of touch with the more mundane side of the game, and thus their opinions are biased. Ironically, what started out as a good thread eventually devolved into a flamefest that had to be locked.<p>This phenomenon is clearly visible to those of us who have been around the EQ community for a long time. And certainly Mobhunter's discussion threads offer plenty of examples of this as well.<p>Consider, for example, recent posts on the monk board about the change to fists at level 65. Despite the fact that this change actually impacted only a very few players, there was a vast outcry from people who weren't even close to level 65 about how unfair this was, and those who tried to say that the nerf wasn't a big deal were screamed at as out of touch with the game.<p>Is there a solution to any of this? Given the size and scope of the current EverQuest playerbase, the answer is no. Back in the day, when there weren't half a million people playing the game, message board communities were much smaller and more tightly knit. Nowadays, many old-time posters are driven away when they see their communities changed into little more than forums on how to twink your newbie and arenas in which to bitch about how evil Verant is.<p>See, that's why we have Mobhunter. Rather than letting my posts become lost in a sea of noise, I always have center stage, thus serving my enormous ego and considerable vanity. While your opinions are allowed to be heard in our discussion threads, I'm the one who gets the spotlight in the stories while you remain my faithful MAK minions.<p>Okay, if the above paragraph doesn't inspire a &quot;flame Moorgard&quot; day I don't know what will--even if I were to point out how ridiculously hard I was giggling when I wrote it.
