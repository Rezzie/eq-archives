If this fix is to prevent people from sitting to med while they are using an item, or casting a spell, will this change make it so that us bards will no longer be able to sit while singing our songs? It is nice to be able to sing Hymn and sit down to get the extra couple hp's a tick, or when we get low on mana because of the 39 charm song and we need to med, if we can't at least have a song going durring this time to help the party out, then might as well say goodbye to the doubling mana regen we get while sitting, as we won't be allowed to sit anymore.<p>As an aside, it will also eliminate a fun taunt bards have with shamans and druids, as we run past them backwards while ducking and singing selo's.<p>Please for once think of the bards before you put something like this on the live servers,<br>Harmani Camlhach, Bard of Kelethin (Vallon Zek)</B><p>This won't affect bard songs. In fact, it gives a little bonus to bards.<p>Here's how it will work, as I understand it.<p>When you are casting a spell or using an item that casts a spell or a song, you will no longer be able to sit down. You will still be able to sit while singing. In fact, you will now be able to start singing while already seated.<p>Ducking will immediately interrupt the casting of any spell or the use of any item. It shouldn't affect songs at all.<p>Over all this will make things easier for casters of all sorts.<p><B>Werdse_Wisdem<p>&gt;The main reason for this change is to fix an 'exploit'. <p>I'm guessing you're referring to being able to activate an item, then sit until just before it goes off to meditate, then stand for the resolution.<p>You said 'exploit' in quotes. IS this an exploit? Is doing it in convention to the EULA? Or is &quot;'exploit'&quot; in this sense &quot;something we don't want to happen, so we're changing it&quot; but not punishable?</B><p>Yes, that's what we're changing. As for punishment and 'exploit' and all that, don't worry about it. It won't be possible to do it after the patch anyhow, so it won't really matter one way or the other.<p>Alan</I><p>Hmmm, what more is there to say? Bards will be happy, while some casters will continue to find a bone to pick.<p>This is why I only play a melee. I just like to hit stuff.
