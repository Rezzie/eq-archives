But... I Don't Have My Rock Yet!</BIG><p>In a surprise move as part of yesterday's patch, Verant has randomized the spawn times on a number of ubermobs. The idea was that the first guild to log on after a patch shouldn't be able to monopolize all the desirable spawns. Fixing that problem is a good thing.<p>However, planning for a post-patch Tormax raid and not finding him up is a major bummer. Then you've got to haul your guild around and try to find what targets might be alive. This causes a bit of frustration.<p>But guilds that do North ToV are reporting some of the most frustrating changes of all. A Safehouse <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=9838.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=25">thread</a> reports that a new mob is up in the chamber of Vulak'Aerr, a drake who tells you how the former boss of ToV has ascended to Veeshan's side. Stepping onto Vulak's pad causes a mass of red-conning mobs to spawn and kill you.<p>What's more, the dragons in ToV all spawn randomly--on an individual basis. That means the traditional NToV dungeon crawl is a thing of the past, unless your server is nice enough to wait to raid the place until everything has popped.<p>So what's the deal with Vulak? Sure, his loot was insanely good, and he was always easier than Vyemm. Common belief was that Vulak was the reward mob for clearing the zone. Apparently Verant decided that more challenge had to be added.<p>Is the mess that spawns on Vulak's pad a kind of Ring of Fire event, in which players have to fight off waves of mobs to get to the boss (presumably Vulak's replacement) who would have the same loot table Vulak did? Or will the Vulak clone only spawn after all other named mobs are dead, a la the Ssra Temple basement? It's too early to tell, as everyone who has been there seems to have been sodomized by the new spawns.<p>Other changes to the zone are that Aaryonar's hitpoints have been upgraded significantly and his guards are now pets, and that the Lords and Ladies (and possibly every named dragon in the north and west wings) are all rooted in place. In other words, NToV just got a lot more challenging for the uberguilds, and basically impossible for most others.<p>Why make these changes to mobs after the top guilds have been farming NToV for months now? Aside from the random spawn times, I'm not sure what the motivation is. Feel free to <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/">blame Tigole</a> if you want to (just kidding, folks). Verant has decided to make ToV a lot tougher, and I guess we just have to roll with it. My main concern is that this action draws an even more definite line in the sand between uberguilds and the nearly uberguilds, which only fosters resentment and misunderstanding in the playerbase. Oh, plus I want phat l3wtz.<p>Someday, my precious rock... someday.<p><BIG>The Giants Will Not Be Outdone</BIG><p>Are the followers of Rallos Zek going to let some scaly worshippers of Veeshan have all the fun? No way! Changes have turned up in Kael, too.<p>Previously, when the Statue of Rallos Zek was killed, the Avatar of War would spawn for around 45-60 minutes. If no one defeated him during that time, the AoW would despawn.<p>This wasn't much of an issue until a few months ago when guilds actually became capable of killing this big baddie. Then the problem arose that one guild would kill the Statue without being able to fight the AoW, so any guild that could kill big bad was unable to do so until the Statue respawned. This was another of those problems that arose because of time zone differences.<p>According to a thread on the Safehouse, <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9842.topic">a big change</a> now eliminates that problem. After the Statue dies, a new mob called The Idol of Rallos Zek spawns. This new guy doesn't drop any loot; he's merely a trigger mob. Kill the Idol (who is still pretty tough) and the AoW rides again.<p>Assuming the Idol doesn't despawn until the Statue spawns again, this change is a really good one. It fixes the problem of &quot;accidentally&quot; spawning the AoW when you kill the Statue, so both AoW and non-AoW guilds can have the shot at the mobs they want. Oh, and the AoW's sword got <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9837.topic">upgraded</a>, by the way.<p><BIG>Luclin Mobs Lament: &quot;We Want Changes, Too!&quot;</BIG><p>In just a sickening display of insisting they get their way, certain Luclin ubermobs heard of the ToV and Kael changes and refused to be ignored.<p>Thought Horror Overfiend <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9845.topic">decided</a> he wants more, tougher guards that respawn faster, plus he wants to be rooted into place. THO, thy wish is granted!<p>The bosses in the Ring of Fire <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9839.topic">clamored</a> for faster spawn times and quicker action. Ring bosses, have it your way!<p>The Shissar in Ssra Temple <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9841.topic">complained</a> that the basement wasn't being guarded well enough, and have asked for some more help down there. Shissar, this is your lucky day!<p>The Umbral Planes have <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9840.topic">changed</a>, just as the patch message promised. Things are higher level, more named mobs are present, and some decent lewtz are showing up. Umbral Planes residents, you... aw hell, forget it.<p>I dread to see what other boss mobs have been rooted in place. I wouldn't be surprised if Grieg decided to stay put, for instance. But I guess we'll find out soon enough.<p><BIG>And Due to All These Changes...</BIG><p>It looks like an <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000491.html">emergency patch</a> is in order:<p><B>On Thursday, February 14th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all servers will be brought down for an emergency patch. The estimated downtime is 3 hours. <br>The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>I know I was having some pretty funky connection problems, but I'm not sure what exactly inspired this patch. Guilds could be excited about another chance at ubermobs, except that you don't know when they'll be up anymore.<p><BIG>It's Not Halloween Yet, Is It?</BIG><p>A systemwide message hit the airwaves last night, announcing that yet another series of GM quests and interesting adventures are coming your way:<p><B>[Wed Feb 13 19:31:46 2002] <SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE>: Brenlo : Greetings Norrath! Peril awaits you around every turn, familiar haunts are not always safe and you never know where new Evil will appear! Today starts a weekend of Adventure!  Let the fun begin!</B><p>The events that happened around Halloween were a lot of fun, so hopefully this adventure weekend continues in that vein. Is this a PR move to make people want to move to Legends? The timing is convenient, to say the least. But ultimately, who cares? If it provides fun for the playerbase, then it's a good thing.<p>Ah well, that's enough news for now. What we thought was going to be just another patch has turned out to have some far-reaching consequences for a lot of players. Like the ancient Chinese curse says, &quot;May you live in interesting times.&quot;
