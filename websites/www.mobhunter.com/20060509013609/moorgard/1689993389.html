<html><head><title>You Can't Go Home Again</title></head><body><h1>You Can't Go Home Again</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-04-28</p><BIG>Service with a Smile</BIG><p>The arrival of a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=55561">new server</a> was announced last week, but since SOE seems to have run out of deities and celestial bodies to name it after, they've come up with a rather novel concept:<p><B>In appreciation for those that have been EverQuest players from the very beginning, this server will be named after one of these long-standing player's characters. SOE will randomly pick 8 of the first 1,000 players who subscribed to EverQuest and who are still playing and then SOE will select one character name from each account. Current EverQuest players will be allowed to vote on which one of those names should be used for the new server.</B><p>We used our extensive insider connections to gain access to the SOE Random Name Tabulator(TM), the custom software used to select the next server's name. While unofficial, here's the list so far:<p><I>Mybankmule<br>Ikeelu<br>Uorulez<br>Pkferlyfe<br>Billclinton<br>Uorulez<br>Gimmeplatz<br>Sexforloot</I><p>Keep in mind that these names were created long before the naming filter became as advanced as it is today. We also realize that the same name turned up twice--hey, this is SOE randomizing code we're talking about, remember?<p>Seems to me a better idea would have been to name the new server after a prominent EQ opinion site... but I digress.<p>Absor also showed up to <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=55565">let folks know</A> the team is considering disallowing character transfers to the new place entirely, instead of simply holding off for six months as the original announcement suggested:<p><B>Thanks for all of the feedback we've already received about the new server! It seems that a lot of people are interested in playing on a fresh server. Several folks have suggested that we remove the &quot;transfers to this server will not be allowed until at least six months after it opens&quot; wording entirely and make it so that this server never allows transfers. <p>We'll take a look into this next week as we work on finding out the name of the server. The idea certainly has merits, and several eyebrows were raised in interest at the appeal of it. I'll post again when I have more information next week.</B><p>There are pros and cons to both approaches. Preventing cross-server moves allows the community on Moorgar--er, whatever the new server is called--to develop and flourish on its own without an influx of high-level people. However, limiting moves also prevents people looking for a fresh start from finding a potentially friendly home.<p>Either way, I'm not going to be losing sleep... even over the name. /sniffle<p><BIG>There All the Honor Lies</BIG><p>Some players were upset about <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=31001.topic">changes to Halls of Honor</a> after the last patch. Seems some mobs randomly summon that didn't before, and folks saw this as another attempt by SOE to nerf soloing. But it turns out that this change wasn't sparked by enchanters or druids or necros, but rather by some bards who were <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessageRange?topicID=17049.topic&amp;start=27&amp;stop=34">getting creative</a>:<p><B>The nerf was done to stop bards from ae kiting.<p>Me and a few other bards on Stormhammer were pulling 60 to 70 mobs at once and ae kiting them dead in under 20mins. We were making 3 to 4 aa's a kite.<p>The only limiting factor was the number of mobs up at once and how many you could pull before your computer got too laggy and crashed everquest.<p>My top record was 115. (almost every pullable mob in the zone) Got almost 6 aa's on that pull.<p>After I maxed my aa's I was doing it to powerlevel other people. Taking chars from 50 to 65 in 1 night, getting people 20 aa's in 5 hours, etc etc.<p>It wasn't an exploit, gms watched me do it several times. But I had a feeling it wouldn't last forever.</B><p>Wow. That makes a pre-nerf necro soloing in CoD look like a turtle.<p>You can't fault bards for using their abilities to come up with such a massive exp farm, nor can you blame SOE for putting a stop to it. It doesn't take a genius to see that nobody was ever intended to rake in that much experience soloing. Sure, SOE might have taken other approaches that wouldn't limit the ability of other classes to solo in HoH, but probably not without significant changes to the bard class. Besides, the designers should have learned from the Grey debacle that you have to limit mass AE kiting before zones go live, and adding summoning mobs is simply an easy way to get that done.<p>You know, stories like this almost make me want to play a bard. But then I remember that they have to carry a flute around with them, and recollections of a traumatic incident at band camp make me think better of it.<p><BIG>In the Sepulchre There by the Sea</BIG><p>You may recall that on my visit to San Diego I was told by the dev team that the long-delayed underwater Kunark zone of Veksar would finally be showing up in game. Sure enough, Veksar is on Test server right now, but it isn't quite what we'd expected.<p><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=ef229f115669b7e6482b98fe879a27f8&amp;threadid=15193">Early reports</A> and <A HREF="http://pub149.ezboard.com/feqdruids24038frm1.showMessage?topicID=3978.topic">pictures</A> show a pretty nifty zone with some new models and plenty of undead mobs. They also show, surprisingly enough, that most of the zone is <I>not</I> underwater as we'd always believed it would be. We asked Rich Waters what the scoop was on this decision:<p><B>The zone design is still an ancient Iksar outpost at the bottom of the Lake of Ill Omen, as it always has been.  When building the zone, we looked at the options and decided to keep most of the zone dry instead of making it completely submerged.  Fully underwater zones have never played very well in our engine, and manage to annoy more players than they entertain.  <p>The current implementation of Veksar takes into account all the existing lore on the zone and builds upon it.  I'm really pleased with how it came out, with excellent art and very entertaining content.</B><p>Seems like sound reasoning to me, for just the reasons Waters mentioned. From Kedge Keep to the Reef of Coirnav, underwater zones have always been plagued by z-axis, pathing, and lag problems that irritate players to no end. Keeping the place mostly dry gets a thumbs up from me.<p>A few people are saying the zone is too far out of the way to see much use. Granted, Planes of Power has spoiled folks a bit, but using the Knowledge book to transport to Firiona Vie and running across one more zone shouldn't be too big of an inconvenience--just think what a hassle it used to be to get to Sebilis. Ultimately what will determine how much this zone gets used is how compelling the content is and how fun it is to play there. Build it right, and they will come.<p><BIG>Working in a Coal Mine</BIG><p>One change that actually <I>was</I> mentioned in last week's patch message would be the revamp of Acrylia Caverns and its <A HREF="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=b6465ba5987184e6bfe6f06b26cfabdc&amp;threadid=6657">adjacent zones</A>. Surprise surprise, <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=31003.topic">opinions are divided</a> on whether the move was a good one; tradeskillers who liked to farm in peace for Acrylia ore find it inconvenient, while level 50-60 players looking for a new place to hunt for experience are rather enjoying it--despite the addition of see-invis mobs that make travel there a bit more difficult.<p><a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=13100.topic">Reports on the new Inner Acrylia</a> are sketchy, though you can actually get into at least the first part of it without doing the nasty key quest. But it sure sounds like more ring events and keys may be needed to get to the boss of the place, which will no doubt make a lot of people simply pass on the zone. But for the not-quite-uber guild that is looking for some new content to explore outside the planes, Inner Acrylia might have something to offer.
