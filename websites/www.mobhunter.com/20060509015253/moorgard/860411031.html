It's kind of hard to explain, but we'll try.<p>quote:<br>--------------------------------<p>All the Pet NPCs are named a certain way which reflects their level. Last week I was cataloguing the sats of the pets in game and I guess I accidentally edited the wrong NPC, when I went to set it back I set it's level to the level indicated in it's name. At some point in the past the level of the 49 necro pet was changed to be higher than the one listed in its name. This caused the max level of the pet as well as its average level to be lowered by 2. I have corrected the mistake I made in the pet's level, and we will be updating this on the servers this afternoon. The update will not require the servers to come down. I'm really sorry for this mistake, and hope I haven't inconvenienced anyone too much. Thanks to everyone who reported my error so quickly.<p>Take care<p>- Lawrence Poe<p>--------------------------------<p>Let me give a fake example. I'm oversimplifying this to help make it clear.<p>Let's say there was a pet named Bob4. That name would indicate that he was of the type Bob and is intended to be level 4.<p>At some point in the past it was decided that Bob needed to be 6th level. Because the name Bob4 is referenced in a lot of other places in the game, changing the name might not be the best idea, so someone just raised Bob4 to level 6.<p>When Lawrence noticed the error he'd made by accidentally editing Bob4, he went back to make Bob4 4th level, as his name indicated.<p>From looking at the data there wasn't an easy way to know that Bob4 should have been 6th level.<p>But when we delved into it and tapped into Gordon's impressive database talent we were able to look and see that prior to Lawrence's revision, Bob4 had indeed been 6th level.<p>Again, we're sorry for the error. And thanks for pointing it out.<p>Alan</B><p>
