We've had to do some rather in-depth work to be able to make these changes. We wanted to make certain that when we did it we could be confident that the results matched our desires, and that our desires were well considered.<p>We're certainly not ignoring Dark Ages of Camelot or any of the other games that are coming up. But we're not working any differently than we always have. I can say that we're honestly impressed with the work that other people are doing. And, sure, that drives us a bit. But our goal has always been to make EverQuest the best game of its type. This change works toward the betterment of the game.<p>...<p>We are going to review casters in much the same way we reviewed melee. <U>Melee is, however, a lot easier to quantify. It's not so easy with casters.</U> Damage output is by no means the only thing that a caster brings to a fight. It's much more complicated to evaluate the effects of debuffs, haste, buffs and even evacs when talking about combat effectiveness. But we certainly have plans to review spell casting.<p>We have, using warriors as a sort of measuring bar, brought the melee classes and hybrids in line with each other. Warriors should now be a little more flexible in that they should find more use for two-handed weapons. But they haven't gained the ability to deal more damage.<p>...<p>What we did was to carefully dissect the damage-dealing ability of all the melee-type classes (for sake of this discussion this includes hybrids) and we determined our goals for them when compared to each other. It was an internal comparison. The combat ability of these classes should now where we want them, relative only to each other.<p>...<p>Don't confuse combat tables and skill caps, though. They are not the same thing. Skill caps are one thing, combat tables are another. The combat table does not determine skill caps. It, basically, determines how effective a class is when using that skill cap.</B><p>Interesting stuff. Absor officially confirms what a lot of folks have concluded via log parsing for a long time regarding how damage tables and skill caps work. Also, he insists that these aren't spur-of-the-moment changes, but rather something that's been in the works for a long time.<p>See the underlined phrase? That's important after you read the next bit.<p>In the lengthy <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8186.topic">thread</a> over at The Safehouse, Kendrick popped in and gave a demi-official <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=8186.topic&amp;start=126&amp;stop=150">response</a> to rogue concerns. It's so interesting, we'll post the message in its entirety:<p><B>I'm going to jump in here quickly, and then jump back out.<p>What we did was NORMALIZE damage output for all melee classes based on existing damage output of Warriors.<p>We looked at what a Warrior can do at 60th level in terms of damage per second, minute, and fight, with a wide range of gear. Once we got a solid set of numbers for that, we made adjustments to other classes as needed.<p>We wanted the Knight classes to do roughly 85% of the damage a Warrior does, so we put them on the same damage table, and made adjustment to 2h weapons and how 2h damage bonuses work. With the changes on test, they are there. Prior to the changes, they were doing 70-75% of the damage a Warrior does.<p>We wanted monks to outdamage a Warrior, currently they were at ~110%, which we felt was not high enough considering the disparity in HP. With the addition of triple attack and a better damage table, they are now at 120% at 60th.<p>Rangers we wanted closer to Warriors, even with the last changes, they were roughly at 90%. Giving them triple attack brings them up closer to 95%. With proper use of spells they can get right at 100%. Giving them another 10 points of defense was the real change here, 200 defense meant they were taking a lot more hits, and more damage per hit, than other melee classes. 10 points gives them better survival chances, but still not as good as the Warrior, SK or Paladin. Those three classes still have superior AC and HP and Defense.<p>Bards are now at 65% of the melee damage of a Warrior. Before the changes that are on test, they were at 40%. I don't think anyone will dispute that Bardic melee was just too low.<p>60th Rogues are STILL doing 140% of a 60th Warrior in a group, and around 100% if they are not able to backstab. Those numbers are fine, some would say they are more than fine.<p>So, by increasing the damage output of the other classes in relation to the warrior, we have not diminished Rogues one iota. They did not need any melee attention, and the entire scope of these changes was to adjust/normalize melee damage output, and melee damage output ONLY. <p>Things like secondary utility were not even discussed when we worked on this, and if there are any changes to be made in that regard, it will occur at a later date, if at all.<p>We also haven't increased the overall damage done to a &quot;raid&quot; NPC in a given fight, if you work under the premise that most high end encounters are already min/maxed by guilds, with the bulk of the melee damage coming from Warriors and Rogues. Those that want to min/max for pure damage output will still be Warrior/Rogue/Monk heavy.<p>We HAVE potentially upped the damage output of mixed experience/casual groups that are not min/maxed, and that is just fine.<p>When we made changes to the 2h weapons, we looked at the best 1h weapons that were availible in the same area/level/difficulty range, and adjusted the 2h weapon ratios on a case by case basis so that they were closer in DPS to dual 1h weapons. Dual wielding the best you can get is still going to outdamage the best 2h weapons in most cases, but not by such a large margin as before. <p>Briefly, on the subject of casting classes. <U>They are next, and they are a lot easier to balance out amongst each other and against the melee classes.</U> The bulk of caster changes can be done via content, rather than code, and they WILL receive attention.</B><p>Notice the underlined portion there? See any sort of conflict with Absor's earlier statement?<p>That's right, folks. They are diametrically opposed. If I played a caster, I'd be just a bit nervous.<p>Now, let's address the issue of whether all this was done in reaction to DAoC coming out soon. If you know anything about programming, you know that major code changes don't just happen overnight, no matter how many programmers you have on the case.<p>Verant has, most likely, been testing these changes for some time, just like Absor says. Does DAoC have anything to do with the timing? Almost certainly.<p>But you know what? I could care less if these changes were inspired by the entire Verant staff converting to Scientology, as long as they get done.<p>I may not be able to hold my breath until the changes go live, but I'll be damned if I'm going to look a gift horse this sexy in the mouth.
