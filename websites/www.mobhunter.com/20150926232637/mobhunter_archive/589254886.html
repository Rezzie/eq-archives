There's a decent <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=15725.topic



">summary</a> over at Graffe's that touches on several points:<p><B>* The next fan faire is in July. The location is Boston.<p>* Manaburn will _not_ be getting nerfed. The dev team is perfectly happy with it currently. They are aware of what a group of MB wizards can do to Kunark mobs, but they said that a wizard with Ice Spear can nuke Emperor Crush in one shot and progression happens.<p>* Caster balance is still a big thing. It will happen slowly over time as they monitor the data acquired across all types of encounters.<p>* Ring of Vulak is hosed mostly due to a NPC trigger system that is very out-dated. They are currently working on fixing it (one programmer is devoted to re-writing it now). This should also fix Ragefire, which is a little broken now in Skyfire.<p>* The Kunark Epic weapons are pretty much done. No more tweaks unless something breaks. However, they are aware that there is a huge difference between epics (cleric vs. warrior, frex).<p>* Beastlords will be getting AA skills, disciplines and tweaks along with the rest of the caster balance. They are not a finished class.<p>* There are four programmers working on the new UI. It will be published to the Test server first, but there is no specific ETA. (Guessing around summer). It will not be part of Planes of Power, and it will be just a patch that everyone will get. It will allow custom graphic skins for UI windows.<p>* Not much info on Planes of Power (one of the internal guys called it Pains of Power, btw -- very funny.) They don't want to promise things they can't deliver. Quote from team member: &quot;We won't do anything in Planes of Power to make it harder on the player.&quot;<p>* Pretty much it's a new development team with the exception of the art team. New designers in charge, but most of them have been GMs at least or content designers from Kunark on. They seem pretty passionate about the game and very open to changes that seemed impossible in the past.<p>* Luclin is still getting tweaked. They asked for feedback, and there was a pretty good stream of it from the audience.</B><p>No big surprises there, really. Lots of stuff is in the works that has been in the works for some time. Then again, Verant has an awful lot of irons in the fire right now<a href="http://www.t-minus17days.com">.</a><p>The folks at EQ Traders have some trade skill-centric news to <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1264.topic">report</a>. There are specific points you should check out if you're into smithing or whatever, but the following sums up the general feeling of the piece:<p><B>He [person conducting the panel discussion] mentioned several times that he had no 'programmer' time to spare on complicated issues...and that the majority of the things he did have the power to fix would be the things that didn't require lots of coding.</B><p>In other words, trade skills are rather low priority.<p>The Ranger's Glade also has a <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=5a42e635f53178ba7bd41afa0ae9a542&amp;threadid=1639">thread</a> that provides info on the question of the oft theorized AC soft cap that will be of interest to many high-level folk:<p><B>[Scott Hartsman's] answer was basically that AC is made up of four components internally (yes he said four). He said there is no hard number entered anywhere for a softcap. He said he could see where one or two of those components might not add much after a certain point, but it wasn't coded with a specific number. He also made the comment that various components might be more or less effective against different mobs with different attack. <p>He did specifically stress though that it did not work like Wis/Int where after a certain number you get reduced returns. <p>This jives with the theory that the softcap is entirely relative to the mob you are fighting. 1100 AC might give diminishing returns vs. Fungus Mushrooms, 1000 against Sebilis frogs, but you might still not have enough at 1400 when you get hit by Tormax.</B><p>So there is no softcap per se, but there are diminishing returns based on the ATK of the mob you're fighting. This doesn't settle any of the arguments that rage on this topic, but those of us with a fondness for + hitpoint gear feel at least a bit vindicated (no offense to that guy in Kael intended).<p>All in all, it sounds like this FanFaire didn't have any huge revelations... not that we were expecting a whole lot, given the fact that Planes of Power is still six months away. The FanFaire in July should have more concrete info, as well as demos, we would hope.<p>Seriously, though, buy the Verant guys drinks and they sing like canaries. If somebody out there did so and has some dirt to report, please <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">send it my way</a>.<p><BIG>Testing, Testing, One, Two, Three</BIG><p>A couple changes have crept up on the Test server. Rangers are pleased to find that Cure Disease has been <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=5a42e635f53178ba7bd41afa0ae9a542&amp;threadid=1593">added</a> to their arsenal of spells. Rangers were lacking this spell forever, and are pretty excited by the potential change, it seems.<p>Less excited are the druids who <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=27182.topic">discovered</a> some other Test server spdat changes. It seems some new port spells or effects have been added that are designed to take clerics to the temples of their deities. As one druid puts it: &quot;Everytime a class obtains a port ability, be it self only, diety [sic] based, or whatnot, the value of a druid diminishes.&quot;<p>I wouldn't go that far. Druids are a sensitive class (must be all that Earth mother junk they hear and the granola they eat), but they really don't have to worry about their usefulness being lessened. If those effects go live, the greatest value to a cleric would be as an evac out of a very bad situation. Most <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008429.html">clerics</a> seem to like this idea (except for the Tunare clerics forced by their big, mean uberguilds to hunt in PoG, of course).<p>Allowing other religious-based classes (paladins and monks) to use such an item would be kind of cool. If nothing else, Quellious monks would like a means to distinguish them at least a little bit from the agnostics of Qeynos.
