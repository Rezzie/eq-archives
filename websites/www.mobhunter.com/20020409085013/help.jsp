<p><FONT CLASS=Title3><b>1. <a name="Q1">What is Mobhunter?</a></b></font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>Mobhunter is a news site dedicated to the game of EverQuest and issues that affect its players. If you don't play EverQuest and aren't interested in the game, you're at the wrong site and may want to try a different search engine.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>The thing that hopefully differentiates Mobhunter from other news sites is that we dig deeper and examine the larger issues behind the stories. We tend to focus on major game events and keep a close eye on the actions taken by Verant and its staff, reporting on the implications of the company's actions (or lack thereof) to the playerbase. While we are supportive and appreciative of the great game Verant has provided for us, we aren't afraid to hold them accountable for their mistakes.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>We do not post articles about trade bazaars or naked troll races. Our focus is not on small-scale events that affect only one server, but on major incidents that touch the playerbase as a whole. We pass this information along in a manner that is hopefully humorous, thought provoking, and enjoyable to read.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>Our readers are encouraged to submit news stories and editorials to us. We will post stories and credit authors who provide us with original news and perspectives that fit our general writing style.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title3><b>2. <a name="Q2">Using the Mobhunter Site</a></b></font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>Besides providing news stories and links to other sites of interest, Mobhunter allows you to create multiple character profiles, manage a guild roster (currently in beta testing), and enter into discussion threads with other players. To use these aspects of our site, you should become a registered user.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title3><b>3. <a name="Q3">Registering with Mobhunter</a></b></font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>Don't worry; this is quick and easy. Click the "Register" link and you will be taken to a screen that asks for a username, password, e-mail address, and name. We won't spam you or give out your information to anyone, ever--so don't be paranoid. We only ask for your e-mail address so that we can send you your password if you forget it and need it later.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>Note: Do not use your EverQuest Station ID and password when you register for Mobhunter! Make up something else-it's easy.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>Once you have registered, you should be logged in to Mobhunter. If not, you can do so manually. If your browser accepts cookies, our site will log you in automatically each time you visit.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title3><b>6. <a name="Q6">Adding a Character Profile</a></b></font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>Mobhunter lets you manage multiple character profiles and allows you to interact with other users through any of your character names.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>Clicking the "Add New Character" link opens the Character Creation Wizard, which will guide you through the character creation process. When you're done, click "Finish" and your character data will be saved.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>You can add multiple characters on multiple servers. Go ahead and add characters to your heart's content. When you submit an article or reply to a news story, you can choose which character name you would like to use.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>Note: Mobhunter's character profiles are still in development. More functionality will be added soon.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title3><b>7. <a name="Q7">Replying to a News Story</a></b></font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>Mobhunter encourages community interaction through the use of discussion threads on the stories we publish. Every story has a "Reply to this Article" link at the bottom. If there is already discussion on a story, the threaded posts will appear below it. Click on a message title to read the post. Navigate through the discussion thread by clicking on the message titles.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>To add your response, click either "Reply to this Article" below the text of the story (which creates a new thread) or "Reply to this Message" if you want to keep your response in a thread that has already been created.</font>

<p><FONT CLASS=Title4>The Mobhunter staff does not want to play babysitter, so please use common courtesy-and common sense-when posting messages.</font>
