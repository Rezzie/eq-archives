<h1 class="article_title">Is SOE Abandoning Everquest?</h1>
<p>by Loral on April 21, 2007</p>

<p>Almost since its birth, players have been asking about the possible death of Everquest. Any game requiring a company's commitment as much as a massive online game will put doubt in the minds of the players. What  happens if the company loses its motivation to maintain the game before the players lose the motivation to play? The remaining players of Asheron's Call 2 found out when it closed down shortly after an expansion's release.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the current status of Everquest.</p>

<p>Is Everquest dead? That requires a personal definition for a dead MMO. For the sake of this article, I will define MMO death as the lack of any support at all. Only when the servers are shut down, when all the developers are moved off to other projects, when all the support shuts down, and when players are unable to play; only then is a MMO really dead. Everquest is a long way from dead.</p>

<p>Is EQ dying? As long as new expansions continue to be produced and released and as long as there are enough players to allow groups and raids to face existing encounters, a MMO isn't dying. By this definition, Everquest is not dying.</p>

<p>But back to the original question: Is SOE Abandoning Everquest?</p>

<p>This is a harder question to define but let us consider a few known variables.</p>

<p>SOE is a different sort of company than other massive online game producers. While other MMO companies might focus on a single title, SOE has built a business around running multiple games with the same back-end infrastructure. They act as a MMO service provider. Not only do they run games with few actual players but they even pick up games that might be struggling. Matrix Online is one such example.</p>

<p>One element easily used to gauge the health of Everquest is to watch Everquest Online Adventures. EQOA has a lot of difficulty to overcome. It is a console title for an older system. It required specialized hardware, a wired network adapter and keyboard, to run. It had very little expansion or patch potential since patches had to fit within a Playstation 2 memory card. How EQOA ever got out the door is somewhat of a miracle. It isn't a bad game but it required a lot of work from the player to even get started.</p>

<p>Everquest Online Adventures still operates today, four years after its original release. With the release of the Playstation 3, it would still seem that EQOA's future is even more bleak but still it hangs on.</p>

<p>EQOA is the MMO we should watch to see just how long SOE will keep a MMO alive before deciding to pull the plug. Right now it would appear that any loss SOE accepts in relation to EQOA is low enough to make it worth keeping around. They can lower this loss by tying it into the rest of the server, network, and support infrastructure used by all of the other games they support.</p>

<p>This broad MMO infrastructure means that any of the SOE-branded MMOs are likely to stay online for a very long time. EQ, as one of the more popular SOE MMOs, is no exception.</p>

<p>SOE continues to announce and release new expansions for Everquest twice a year. While some, like the Serpent's Spine, have more to offer than others, like Prophecy of Ro, a lot of new content gets released every year into a game now eight years old.</p>

<p>SOE recently made a strategic decision that had many questioning the health of the game. The Serpent's Spine, an expansion intended to bring new players into the game by offering a new player race and large hunting areas, quests, and encounters for levels 1 to 75, was released only digitally. They did not sell it retail and did not offer a boxed version. For an expansion intended to bring new players into EQ, this seemed a strange decision. This practice continued with the Buried Sea.</p>

<p>This shift to online only releases seems to dictate that SOE has changed its philosophy in relation to EQ. Rather than attempt to bring new players into EQ, SOE hopes to bring older players back to EQ and keep current players playing. Given the very stiff competition of World of Warcraft, this might be a smart move. In the mind of one pompous egotistical high elf, EQ cannot compete with World of Warcraft for new players.</p>

<p>SOE recently announced the release of a new compilation pack for Everquest called the Everquest Anniversary Edition. This $20 boxed package will be available retail and includes Everquest and every current expansion. That is an amazing deal considering that, for us old timers, the base game and all thirteen expansions cost about $400. The release of the Anniversary edition could do a better job of bringing in new players than the release of the Serpent's Spine. Only time will tell.</p>

<p>What of Everquest 2? How does it relate to SOE's attitude towards EQ? We cannot know what is in the minds of the management at SOE but we can make assumptions on their overt behavior.</p>

<p>Everquest 2 cost a lot of money and a lot of that money likely came from Everquest's profits. SOE put a lot into the technology and marketing of EQ2 going so far as to release an entirely new set of player models strictly to market to Asian gamers. One cannot help but wonder if the money spent on Asian-friendly player models might instead have been spent on new player models for Everquest. Since the first days players asked for new player models we heard that the costs were simply too high. Yet a short time later SOE announces the release of new player models for EQ2. It is possible that these models were financed by the Taiwanese developer of Everquest 2, Soga, but I could never get a clear answer when I asked this question to SOE.</p>

<p>While SOE chose to release The Serpent's Spine download only, they still released and heavily marketed Echos of Faydwer Everquest 2 expansion to retail shelves. Again one could speculate that this shows SOE's desire to market only one of these games to new players. We cannot know the exact resources SOE spends on one game over another but we can safely speculate that EQ2 takes up significantly more resources than EQ. When one company runs two games, or in this case even more, there are times when its resources have to go one way or another.</p>

<p>What does this all mean for existing Everquest players? Not much. As long as we desire it, Everquest is likely to continue. As long as expansions are profitable, we will continue to see them every six months. As long as SOE has a team of artists, designers, and programmers dedicated to Everquest, we should continue to see improvements in the game.</p>

<p>There are areas where SOE's focus on EQ2 hurts Everquest, however, and it is important that our voices are heard. Better quality control, new player models, better server and network stability, and improved exploitation prevention are all important topics to existing EQ players. These requests also require significant resources and only by speaking out can we clearly show SOE that it needs to spend the required resources Everquest deserves.</p>

<p>Is SOE abandoning Everquest? Only if we let them.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say SoE is abandoning EverQuest, but they do seem to be neglecting it.  A lot of the small details which made previous expansions special are missing in The Buried Sea.  The lack of things to do for mid-level raiding guild players is disheartening.</p>

<p>>>> While SOE chose to release The Serpent's Spine download only, they still released and heavily marketed Echos of Faydwer Everquest 2 expansion to retail shelves.</p>

<p>It's more than that.  The retail version of Echoes was not only an expansion pack, it was a compilation pack.  So people could pick it up, and have the core game as well as all the previous expansions.  I found that an interesting decision (welcome too, as I had not purchased the previous expansions, and that brought me up to date.)  Considering EoF and TSS had a lot of similaritites (being developed at the same time, expansion for levels 1 thru max, new playable race in both, both seemed to be directed at bringing new players in, etc.) It would have seemed logical that TSS would follow the distribution model, and not only be on the shelves (a decision that still puzzles me greatly) but it should have also been a compilation pack like EoF was.</p>

<p>EverQuest seems to be fairly healthy for the time being, as loral said. And he is right when he says SOE is a bunch of money monkeys...but what really pisses me off, is the the fact they just refuse to advertise.</p>

<p>There are soo many people in the world, EQ still needs to be advertised... to give up and play dead against WoW is foolish! Not everyone wants to play WoW!  </p>

<p>The two games are in different leagues... WoW is attractive to many, but EverQuest still has some good times packed away in it...</p>

<p>But, I'm not giving up and saying, well WoW is better they win... I'm saying EQ is great, just needs new models and some more/better developers.</p>

<p>I think it really depends on how much it cost to keep the game running. You can see it hypnotically. If the everquest 1 team is made up of 40 people (sound, art, devs). And each makes 70K a year, everquest would need to make 2.8 million with out the subscriptions cost to break even.</p>

<p>There normally 2 expansions a year at 29.99 (30 to make it easy). They need to sell 93,333 expansion a year, or 46,666 each 6 months.</p>

<p>I don't know how many copys SOE sells, but i'm guessing it way over 46,666 an expantion. And even then i Doubt the team is 40 people making 70K.</p>

<p>Is SOE abandoning EverQuest? No.  But SOE can no longer make EverQuest a competitive game.  Is EverQuest dying?  Yes.  It cannot bring in new blood: this is the definition of endangerment, and EverQuest is well on the path towards extinction.</p>

<p>Why can EverQuest not bring in new blood? The answer was actually broached in a really well-written article of this month's "Game Informer" magazine, where an MMO designer contributed an article lamenting how publishing companies put out a budget of $5-10M and ask small development houses to produce an MMO. The end-result tends to be decent, but not revolutionary, but when the publishers look at the proof of concept, they stack it up against World of Warcraft, point out all of the ways in which it falls short, and then, ultimately, reject the project. One big-name firm (Ubisoft) has even turned away new development work because, in their view, they'd rather fund their own development teams and possess the creative capital, than have the creative process outsourced to smaller start-ups, like Sigil. It's a fascinating read, and I recommend everyone to read it.</p>

<p>World of Warcraft's budget? Vivendi disclosed that it was funded by Blizzard at a starter sum of $90,000,000 just on development.  It totally changed the game and the dollars behind how much money is necessary to create a competitive contender for new blood.  This totally ups the ante, and more and more MMO development houses are going out of business or consolidating, since larger publishing firms would rather spend that sort of money on internal talent that they can retain, rather than outsourcing it.  SOE's forthcoming purchase of Sigil is a harrowing deja vu of the Verant acquisition by Sony.  In the backdrop of all of these potential games being cancelled (Mythica, Wish, Ultima Online 2 all being great recent casualties), EverQuest's subscription numbers continue to steadily decline.</p>

<p>World of Warcraft is a great game, and I love it; don't get me wrong. But I am frankly a bit saddened to see that one game, which triumphs so decisively, which claims so much time, from so many players, developers, industry insiders, and investors, has such a wide-reaching impact on how all other games are made, and ultimately, how games get cancelled. </p>

<p>Everquest is not going to wrap up and be closed down next week.  That said, don't for a second think that SOE isn't completely aware of the number of paying accounts that have to be maintained in order to turn a profit.  They have made projections, they are 100% aware of thier monthly churn of people leaving, and people coming back.  Don't for one millisecond think that they do not have a known number at which the servers will be merged, then merged again, and so forth until only the most completely hooked players remain.  At the last, when no more expansions are being made, and no more development is being done because everquest is nothing more than an ancient history that still pulls in a trickle of profit, and the sole remaining server is the last one standing; even then, SOE knows exactly how many accounts have to be maintained in order to turn a profit...and the day that last remaining server drops below the threshold it will be turned off.</p>

<p>Until then, rest safe in the knowledge that everquest will remain up, safe, and florish with the wit, and the repast of those people who hold it dear.</p>

<p>Is there a way to bring everquest back to life?  Probably not.  SOE would have to win back the trust of litteraly tens of thousands of people whom they have burned over the years.  Those people have all told endless horror stories to thier gaming friends.  Those friends who have never even played an SOE title have told thier frinds the horror stories and so forth to the point that even the most unbiased person has a deeply rooted conviction that SOE changes the rules on it's players at random (EQII Class and Crafting changesx2, and SWG Class, crafting and combat changes), is impossible to solo (EQ...), and is only for "hardcore raiders who hate casual players" (again...EQ).  Heck, even a brief glance over there very forums where the "fans" of EQ liberally piss on the comments made by a fellow fan of EQ in a volley of praise over how "hardcore" EQ is because you have to repeat broken content endlessly in order to prove to your fellow fans how truely dedicated you are, help to fuel the view of EQ and SOE titles as being not for the average person.  In fact you generally come away from most fan forums with a sense that new people are simply not wanted, and are to be treated like dirt.</p>

<p>Now ask yourself, if you read this forum, your a fan of the game (or where at one point), you know the flaws, the failures, the issues.  How would you tell SOE in concrete terms what they should do to win back the hearts and wallets of all thos people they've burned over the years?</p>

<p>What grand plan would you have SOE persue?</p>

<p>If 10,000 fans of Everquest can't come up with a point by point plan to make Everquest rise from the ashes, then really what possible hope is there a bunch of developers in San Diego, who are more worried about thier carreers with SOE and thier ability to pay thier rent than any one game title, are going to do better?</p>

<p>Seriously, what plan would you form, would you have the stomach to go public, would you rally people to your cause, would you push with all your might, spend your own money, your own time?</p>

<p>Or will you just shoot people down?  Be a forum troll?  Quote things out of context?  And generally waste time while never actually doing anything about the thing you say your so pasionate about?</p>

<p> When the MMORPG market was just taking off and EQ had around 500k subscribers, it seemed everyone wanted to make an MMORPG. All these developers figured they could put out a game and get 200-300k subscribers. Unfortunately that was not meant to be and there was a huge shake up and many games that did not make those loft expectations were ended and countless more canceled while they were still in development. </p>

<p> I think SoE knows they can't compete with the 6 million+ subscribers of Warcraft so they are going with the strategy of puting a bunch of games with smaller subscriber bases and make a profit that way. Perhaps the future holds more games targeted to specific playing types, but that is somewhat doubtful due to the huge cost involved in producing and running a MMORPG.</p>

<p> With original EQ they should have redone the character models a long time ago and agressively marketed that they they have the most bang for the buck. Meaning original EQ has by far the most content of any MMORPG out there. Unfortunately 95% of this content goes unused due to most of the players being high level and raiding. I couldn't even imagine being a true newbie and trying to find a group to do anything.</p>

<p> It looks like EQ will be left to die a slow death. Sure they will keep coming out with expansions until it no longer becomes profitable to do so, but unless they come up with something fantastic they are not going to get any massive amount of new players. But who wants to buy a game with 7 year old graphics? It seems they are focusing most of their efforts on to EQ2.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Kaelon on April 29, 2007 11:41 AM</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to Ghost of Zek's opinions, most game publishers do not actually have a plan for disengagement.  Games like Asheron's Call 2 and Earth & Beyond are cancelled on snap-decisions once it becomes apparent that the game is in a downward spiral (AC2 was actually cancelled right in the middle of an expansion development).  Other games, like Mythica, Wish, and Ultima Online 2 are cancelled during development, after millions are already spent, when it becomes obvious that they will not yield an immediate profit.</p>

<p>EverQuest has a budget that is built on yesteryear's figures of a couple million bucks at most (expansions are undoubtedly getting funded for much, much less), but SOE is looking to competing with the big boys which means a $50M+ development budget at least.</p>

<p>The one silver lining for diehard EQ players is that SOE is quickly developing a reputation as the graveyard of MMOs -- it's the place where games go to die, more or less.  Whether it's Matrix Online, or now, apparently, Vanguard, games are sold to wholesale control by the publishing giant which then comes up with schemes to keep them profitable.  In the meantime, their gamers are driven away by poorer and weaker content.  Zolina's post is a great example of how this is already beginning to happen to EverQuest.</p>

<p>EQ2's figures are not that positive, either, regrettably.  All of the European PvP Servers (5 of them) are merging into a single super-server. How far off can U.S. server mergers be? (It's easy to forget that there was already one round of EQ2 server mergers, and three rounds of EQ1 server mergers).</p>

<p>All in all, it's getting tougher for gamers to choose where to invest their time if there isn't a prospect of a promising, flourishing world.</p>

<p>Ghost of Zek asks: "How would you tell SOE in concrete terms what they should do to win back the hearts and wallets of all thos people they've burned over the years?"</p>

<p>I talked about this last night over dinner with my wife. I don't think my suggestions are much different from ones I've given in the past:</p>

<p>1. Add New Player Models for All Races.</p>

<p>2. Rebuild Plane of Knowledge into a central hub of adventure, commerce, and social interaction.</p>

<p>3. Focus on 30 minute to 60 minute adventures, including travel time, and test them thoroughly. Build 20 excellent instances instead of 60 ho-hum ones. Test the hell out of them and balance them around real non-raiders.</p>

<p>4. Re-introduce monster missions that show the history and current storyline of Everquest. Make more monster missions like the Nagafen and Thurgadin missions and less like the faerie and orc missions. Build epic monster missions instead of cute ones.</p>

<p>5. Narrow the gear gap between raiders and non-raiders. Gear from The Buried Sea is still not as powerful as Anguish gear from seven expansions past. Next expansion high-end group gear should be better than Demiplane of Blood. Worry more about getting players into your current expansions than about making previous expansions obsolete.</p>

<p>Those are my five suggestions. It's a great question. What would you do to improve Everquest?</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Kaelon on April 29, 2007 12:09 PM</strong></p>
<p>Great suggestions, Loral.  My five suggestions:</p>

<p>1. 30-60 minute adventure content should be done int he style of Lost Dungeons of Norrath, updated for the latest scripting techniques (see Lord of Rings Online for an impressive example of what is done). </p>

<p>2. Eliminate the Bazaar; implement an Auction House commerce system to place the player economy into overdrive.  </p>

<p>3. Redesign tradeskills to emphasize simplicity, accessibility, and mastery of trades.  Add in stronger specialization tracks to encourage differentiation.  Then, limit players to the number of tradeskills they can pursue at any given time.</p>

<p>4. Continue redesigning and relaunching older world content, without discarding hallmarks of EverQuest lore (such as the Newbie Log in the First Nektulos revamp). Focus the next expansion on a Faydwer revamp or an Erudin/Paineel revamp.</p>

<p>5. Redesign the User Interface emphasizing simplicity and accessibility.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Redcloud on April 29, 2007 03:46 PM</strong></p>
<p>I'd love to see SOE rip the ideas of WoW, Vanguard and LOTRO off.</p>

<p>Among a few things:</p>

<p>Auction bid/sell house, sending results (success or sale) by mail like LOTRO</p>

<p>30 minutes Quests, lots of them, well tested. Collaborative questing, any quest should be shareable in a group to avoid a number of issues.</p>

<p>Complete revamp of graphics: let's face it, the comparison with this year's MMO is a killer. Models are one thing but the overall difference is huge.</p>

<p>I found LOTRO to be the closest of what I would have wanted EQ to be, in graphics and quest terms.</p>

<p>Make the 1-50 game of eq free to play (maybe with restrictions)</p>

<p>Lots of very good suggestions there.</p>

<p>Personally I think there is a lot that Everquest could do to reinvigorate itself, but it will be creative ideas such as this that enable it.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Sunshadow on April 29, 2007 06:52 PM</strong></p>
<p>To revitalize EQ, you need to make the word come alive again. To do this you need 3 simple things.</p>

<p>1) Shrink the world. Atm the game is to bloody big there are nearly more zones than players on the servers.</p>

<p>2) Get rid of instances except for raids, they just make the world feel empty.</p>

<p>3) Hire some GM's just for EQ rather than farming them across multiple games.</p>

<p>wow loral calling for new player models,  aint you the guy that used to continually slap me and others down years ago when we asked for such, stating price too high, well the subscription figures were higher then, and probably remaking the model cost lower, so how exactly do you expect them to do it now ? when  subscriptions are a lot lower.</p>

<p>for me eq died when they started to continually abandon contect, first then abandoned firona vie story arc, in favor of moden rasp and nedaria etc, then  they abandoned that !!! anyone here know if nedaria  alived or died ?? and came back to firona.</p>

<p>to say is it too late, is wrong, nothing is too late, its if they want too or not, they could make eq better than  wow if they put the effort in, will they, shrug, very much doubt it, but i dont care  i play wow now,  even though i dont get as much character interaction there is still loads to take up my time, and my friends i talk to with msn, instead of in group waiting for a mob to be pulled, shrug.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Mozartz on April 29, 2007 09:11 PM</strong></p>
<p>Some mentioned already that I would have included ( new player models ), but my five:</p>

<p>(1) Double experience advancement for levels 1 - 60</p>

<p>(2) Make all older content that is sub level 50, the same zone across all servers, but disengage     trading, dropping etc so that you minimize cross economic contamination ( if that matters anymore)) </p>

<p>(3) Make plat useful again by (a)a legitmate plat sink ( rez potions? makeable by clerics for ~250 with npc bought items? ) (b) Create sellable npc drops that aren't tied to tradeskills</p>

<p>(4) An aggressive marketing strategy which promotes EQ as being what it is (a) not WoW (b) challenging but not abusive<br />
    <br />
(6) The most radical idea and quite honestly Im not sure you could pull this off at this point: Make guilds (a) not able to have more members than 50 and then gear content accordingly and/or (b) make guilds have level restrictions such as 1-40, 41-55, 56-69. and 70+. For those guilds that are centered around levels less than 70, include an exp bonus when guilded.  <br />

<p>"While other MMO companies might focus on a single title..."</p>

<p><br />
Companies is the key word in that sentence, there aren't a lot of companies around making 1 MMO. Everyone may start with 1, but they never seem to stay there for long, especially if the first one is a success. </p>

<p>You're right about funds from EQ1 subsidizing other games (where else would the money have come from?), but in all honesty, isn't that just how business works?  Is there a specific accounting of how much $$ blizzard pulls out of development to give to Vivendi and its massive debt load? Does it really matter if a game is receiving proper development attention?</p>

<p>Naturally, my final question there should really be the focus of debate regarding EQ1.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Teremar on April 30, 2007 01:07 PM</strong></p>
<p>How would people feel about paying for new character models? Basically making them an expansion?</p>

<p>The bean-counters at SOE are all about return on investment. Expansions are great because they bring in money. Changes to the game only pay off if they cause people to change their behavior--subscribe when they wouldn't have otherwise. If the bean-counters thought new models would pay for themselves that way they'd have made them a long time ago.</p>

<p>So what if there were an expansion with little or nothing in it but new models? Make it separate from the regular six-month cycle of "real" expansions (since most of the devs wouldn't be involved anyway). They'd also probably include some sort of gimmick to drive sales. A level cap increase with no new content would be a bad idea, but that's the kind of thing they'd be looking for--something too good to pass up even if you don't care about the models.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that some people would react with outrage ("They should be free!"). But realistically that's the only way I see it happening. So if a lot of people would be willing to pay for a models-only expansion, I'd suggest communicating that to SOE.</p>
