If one is to be immersed at all in a virtual world, then there have to be significant consequences for one's actions.<p>The simplest example of this is seen when you first start a new character. You turn in a note to your guildmaster, and positive faction changes result. You kill certain mobs (orc, goblins) and you gain positive faction with nearby cities and certain guilds, and lose faction with the mobs you've killed. Generally speaking, the more levels you gain, the more complex factions become.<p>The conflict between the Freeport Militia and the Knights of Truth... the hatred of pretty much everyone for the Iksar... the Halflings and that damn wall of theirs... factions are everywhere in the game. Even the new Chardok has an <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8484.topic">NPC</a> to help you gain faction with the Sarnaks for possible quests.<p>Velious was the culmination of Verant's ideas on how faction should work. Would you side with the Coldain--the closest thing to a traditionally &quot;good&quot; race on the continent; giants--intelligent versions of the brutish thugs inhabiting Antonica and Kunark; or dragons--the traditional targets of dungeon-crawling adventurers everywhere? Even the new planes introduced with Velious had faction ties to the old world--especially the Plane of Growth. Suddenly, deciding what to kill wasn't so clear-cut anymore.<p>On paper, this faction system was a great idea. Suddenly, not every player would be after the same targets anymore. The days of every guild wanting Vox, Nagafen, Trakanon, and Venril Sathir looked to be numbered, since some guilds could kill dwarves, others giants, and others dragons, while still others hunted in Growthplane. It was just a matter of choosing which side you wanted to be on and making it happen.<p>In reality, things were a bit more complex. Your guild obviously had to decide where the biggest payoff would be for them. Dwarves were the easiest to side with, giants somewhat harder, and dragons seemed tough to get along with. Plus, the dragons were so tempting to kill for those shiny talismans that could shame the Necklace of Superiority. But rumors persisted of the biggest payoffs being reserved for those guilds who alligned with the dragons, so some guilds decided to take the tougher path and see what would happen.
