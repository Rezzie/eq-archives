Old mister Vulak ran things in the Temple of Veeshan, making sure the bills were paid, the guests were fed, and that all the baby drakes and wyverns were well cared for. For these services, Veeshan herself paid Vulak a handsome salary, and the old dragon hoarded a great many valuable treasures.<p>But when outsiders began invading the temple, slaughtering its inhabitants one by one, it became clear that Vulak didn't have the mustard necessary to defend his home very well. Once a week like clockwork, hoards of pesky short beings would invade the temple and beat up Vulak until he handed over his milk money. This became embarrassing for the dragons.<p>In order to hide her shame, Veeshan commanded Vulak to hide under the floorboards of his room. She posted a drake outside his door to tell invaders that Vulak had been summoned to his goddess's side. And if any of these mortals were foolish enough to begin searching his room, wave after wave of very tough dragonkind would appear and pummel these invaders to dust.<p>That didn't stop the mortals from trying, of course, and a few of the very best actually managed to finish off the last of the guardians. But more terrified than ever, Vulak remained hidden under the carpet, refusing to come out and meet his certain doom.<p>Until now, that is.<p>Members of the notoriously uber guild called <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">Afterlife</a> finally managed to coax Vulak'Aerr out of hiding after a three-hour long battle with some very tough customers. Besides the typical insanely good loot that always dropped, Vulak also gave up two of the much-coveted ancient spells.<p>Why so much <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=18793.topic">hubub</a> over ancient spells? Because they've been all but absent from the game since they were first added to the spdat file many months ago. Allegedly they were thought to drop off boss mobs, but even Vex Thal raids haven't turned up any. Now all of a sudden there are a couple off the notoriously buggy Ring of Vulak, and casters are a bit peeved.<p>Look, some loot <I>should</I> be insanely rare, as in only a couple people per server should ever see it. That's part of what makes players unique, and ancient spells fit into this category as well. But a three-hour fight that can only be completed by the very toughest (and perhaps luckiest) guilds does seem a bit much.<p>Does Afterlife's win mean the Ring of Vulak is fixed? Tough to say. Rest assured that more and more guilds will be testing it to see, though.<p>After all, that Vulak carries some pretty nice milk money.<p><BIG>Protection of the Cabbage Protected</BIG><p>One of the most involved trade skill quests ever put into the game is the Protection of the Cabbage quest. This lengthy pursuit uses most every trade skill in the book and results in a handy druid spell and earring, the latter of which can be traded in for a very nice general purpose earring for any class.<p>Since its inception, though, players have been concerned that the PotC quest would be going away. Why? Because the quest involves combining nine gifts, all of which are tradeable. On just about any server you can find folks selling the complete quest kit for 20-30K, and the results are comparable to other earrings that sell for 80-100K.<p>Rich Waters stopped by the Druid's Grove, though, to <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=27911.topic">assure</a> cabbage lovers that the quest is safe and sound:<p><B>It's just a rumor, there's no plans to remove Rebecca from Fungusgrove or change the PoTC quest.<p>Thanks,<p>- Rich</B><p>Is the quest too easy? Not if you actually make all the parts yourself. There are a ton of components to collect, not to mention the high-level trade skills that are required. But being able to buy a kit and get the earring in a matter of 10 minutes is a bit suspect. You should know by now that if something seems to good to be true, it usually is. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the gifts became nodrop at some point, but for now the quest is safe. Even so, I recommend you don't wait too long if you can help it.<p>Besides, as a melee it's cool to have a flowing thought item. My mana regen is now through the roof!<p><BIG>Vex Thal for Sale?</BIG><p>Ah, Vex Thal. The uberest of the uberzones. Only the best of the best can get there, because you have to be able to take down the Emperor in Ssra to complete the key quest. This is the one reward zone in game that is sure to be free of gimps and freeloaders. Ah, true uberdom at last. Right?<p>Right?<p>Maybe not, thanks to the magic of Stormhammer. See, part of paying your extra $27 a month for the Legends service is that you can transfer back to your old server at will. Or, if your character is a Stormhammer native, you get to move to the server of your choice with all your gear.<p>This sets up a nice little smuggling operation that lets you sneak gear from the Legends server to any other server that will meet your price. And what's the hot commodity that currently fetches the big bucks?<p><a href="http://www.playerauctions.com/listings/details/index.cfm?itemnum=1027258615">Power sources</a> from the Emperor himself.<p>That's right; the lengthiest, most dreadful quest in the game can be served to you on a silver platter. All it takes is real-life cash. Or, say you just want to <a href="http://www.veeshanvault.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=275">mess with a particular uberguild</a>, you can use the power sources to do that, too.<p>Furor and the <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/html/index.php">Fires of Heaven</a> crew aren't happy about it. Of course, they sell extra power sources, too, but only to people on their own server that they deem worthy. While that moral distinction may be dubious, at least they aren't exploiting the design of the game and violating the integrity of multiple servers to do it.<p>Regardless of who is doing the complaining, there is a valid concern that abuse of the Legends service is real. No, not everyone who plays on Stormhammer is a <a href="http://pub116.ezboard.com/flegends11114frm2.showMessage?topicID=180.topic">greedy primadonna who can't cope with life on a regular server</a>--that's an unfair stereotype. But even the most ardent Legends supporter would have to concede that unscrupulous individuals will use every opportunity to exploit design flaws in this game whenever possible. And it is a fact that the ability to move a character to another server complete with sellable gear is a questionable policy.
