<html><head><title>Best In Show</title></head><body><h1>Best In Show</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-06-20</p>The 2001 Game Critics Awards have been <a href="http://www.e3awards.com/win.html">announced</a>, and Sony has taken home the Best PC Game trophy for their upcoming Star Wars Galaxies title.<p>&quot;LucasArts, in partnership with Sony Online, the creators of EverQuest, revealed a game that is epic in scope, rich in potential, and simply breathtaking to look at.  Set across a span of time that encompasses all the Star Wars movies, the game will have 8 playable species and just about anything else you can think of.&quot;<p>The game was also runner-up for the Best In Show award.<p>Nobody is talking release dates yet, but Sony may find themselves in the very unique position of being their own strongest competition. Given the rabid fanbases that belong to both EverQuest and Star Wars, you know there's a lot of crossover, and--despite their best efforts--Verant still hasn't found a way to put more than 24 hours in a day. So, fanboy, what's it going to be... wood elf druids or Jabba's slave girls?<p>Just like Luclin is going to sell a lot of GeForce 3 cards, SWG is going to sell a lot of PCs.<p>The competition (that is, those few MMORPG titles that Verant is <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/">not making</a>) better step up to the plate with something good. Fast.
