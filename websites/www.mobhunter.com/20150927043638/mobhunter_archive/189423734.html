<html><head><title>One Quick Turnaround</title></head><body><h1>One Quick Turnaround</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-10-20</p><BIG>Ask and Ye Shall Receive</BIG><p>Rich Waters stopped by the firestorm that used to be the paladin message board to deliver <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=16958.topic">good news</a> to masses of unwashed paladins irate over the proposed change to the Slay Undead skill:<p><B> Over the last day, we've received a great deal of feedback and concern over the proposed Slay Undead change. We've put a lot of thought into the issue, and decided to hold off making any changes to Slay Undead for the foreseeable future.<p>Slay Undead will continue to work in exactly the same way, and deal the same damage it does on live servers currently, and remain at that balance through level 65. Damage caused by Slay Undead won't increase post-60, though Paladin melee damage in general will continue to rise as you level up. There will be no defense penalty imposed while using this skill.<p>We'd like to apologize for any undue frustration this has caused you, and we appreciate the feedback that was sent in. This change was well-intentioned, but we realized we were focusing too much on the potential of the top 5% of Paladins, and while the solution was reasonable for that sub-group, it wasn't appropriate to apply across the board.<p>Thanks for your patience,<p>Rich Waters<br>Lead Designer, EverQuest</B><p>As you can imagine, this news has paladins dancing in the aisles. It's a good decision on Verant's part, but the move is not without controversy.<p>Monks in particular have started a public outcry, claiming that it's unfair for paladins to get a nerf reprieve after monks took it on the chin defensively. A few smarmy paladins have responded that their reaction was simply more well-reasoned than the monks' was. And so fisticuffs ensued.<p>Rich Waters' phrasing is a tad unfortunate, as his introduction does give the impression that player feedback was the mitigating factor in reversing their decision to nerf. This lead to criticism that all you have to do to get Verant to change their minds is complain loudly enough. Of course, if this were true, wizards and mages and monks would have been untouched, while necros would still be the most uber class of all.<p>So what is the real reason that paladins are safe while monks failed to evade nerfdom? The key lies in Waters' comment that the change was really only intended to prevent &quot;the potential of the top 5% of Paladins&quot; from getting out of hand.<p>Slay Undead is a situational skill. As I said yesterday, there's nothing wrong with some classes having situation advantages over others; this is a fundamental principle of balance. Druids have advantages in outdoor zones with wide open spaces, for example, while other classes perform better in dungeons. That's just part of the game.<p>The thing that made the changes to monk defense, manaburn, and mod rods necessary was that these things affected every aspect of the game. Monks weren't just superior tanks against one type of mob; they were better at avoiding damage against virtually <I>every single mob in the game,</I> apart from a handful of bosses. Manaburn was ultra-powerful against <I>every single mob in the game,</I> just as mod rods were a crutch for <I>every single encounter.</I> These were global problems that had to be addressed with global solutions.<p>The Slay Undead skill is effective against one type of mob only, and in fact only becomes questionable in terms of balance when used by that top 5% of paladins. This fact is actually the monks' best reason to complain, though, because the defensive nerf has the least impact upon the top 5% of monks--the very people that made the change necessary. Just as it would have been unfair to hurt all paladins based upon the potential performance of a very few, it's a shame that monks with non-uber gear are suffering the most.<p>Slay Undead will cap at level 60, preventing paladins from gaining proportionately more power with the skill on the way to 65. Pallys are pleased with this solution, and monks will just have to find a way to suck it up and deal with it.<p>/em sucks it up and deals with it<p><BIG>A Shaman by Any Other Name Would Smell as Foul</BIG><p>For those of you wondering what your new class title will be when you hit level 65, the uncertainty <a href="http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=25544.topic">is over</a>:<p><B> 5755 Battlemaster<br>5756 Archon<br>5757 Protector<br>5758 Dread Lord<br>5759 High Warder<br>5760 Nature Walker<br>5761 Elder Grandmaster<br>5762 Symphonist<br>5763 Master Assassin<br>5764 Spiritweaver<br>5765 Arch Lich<br>5766 Arcanist<br>5767 Grand Magus<br>5768 Elder Phantasmist<br>5769 Feral Lord</B><p>I'm not so sure I like being called &quot;elder&quot; anything, but I guess I'll learn to live with it. Hopefully the rogue title will get shortened to &quot;Master Ass.&quot; Now <I>that</I> would be fun to see.<p><BIG>Babalu</BIG><p>Spell changes continue to pile up by the hundreds on Test server as Planes of Power draws near, and no place gives you better access to what's new than <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2002-10-20%2010:00:43">Lucy</a>. The site was recently revamped with a news section and a message board, which gives a much fuller feel to the mounds of raw data that the site provides.<p>Am I the only one who pictures Desi Arnaz doing his &quot;Luuuuuuuceeeeee!&quot; voice when I go to that site? Maybe it's just me.<p><BIG>Inbreeding Comes Through Again</BIG><p>Reports are circulating that certain Walmart stores have Planes of Power on the shelf today--two days before the official release. While a quick trip to my local store came up empty, other people are having luck picking up the expansion.<p>Hey, if you can take advantage of the limited intelligence of Walmart employees, why not do so? You might find yourself in the planes a day ahead of your friends. Of course, doing so requires that you actually step inside a Walmart--the store whose typical clientele makes Jerry Springer fans look like Rhodes Scholars. These are the people who couldn't handle the deep fryer at KFC and had to settle for stocking shelves at Wallyworld. So it's up to you whether you want to dig through stacks of auto tires and shotguns to hopefully find a copy of PoP. <p>Remember, kiddies, there's a patch tomorrow morning and then only one more day until PoP is live. To sorta quote Hank Jr.--&quot;Are you ready for some downtime?&quot;
