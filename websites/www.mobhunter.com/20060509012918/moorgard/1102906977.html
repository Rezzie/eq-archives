This is due partly to one of their new AAXP skills: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=5965bef54ae92837041fca65cc24c35c&amp;threadid=19038">rabid bear form</a>.<p>What does this new Luclin skill do? Gives them:<p>- Over 250 point ATK bonus<br>- 100% haste<br>- a disease-based proc (&quot;tainted bite&quot;)<br>- gives the shaman the double attack skill<p>The downside? It lasts five minutes and has a two-hour refresh timer, plus it can be dispelled like any other buff. There is some debate about the timer, but most shamans think this is a pretty cool skill. Too bad there isn't a foaming-mouth particle effect, though.<p>You'd think that would be enough shaman coverage for one day--but not here at Mobhunter! Being an old melee type, I know which class butters my bread, so I'm going to give my favorite buffers some <a href="http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~bnh/lotr/lotrmain.html">mad props</a> today. (Also, in case you haven't noticed, it's a Slow News Day.)<p>Shamans continue to have a hard time obtaining many of their high-level spells. Malo, Torpor, Pox of Bertoloxxus, and even the much-debated Avatar are all hard-to-find spells, and it's  a fairly rare level 60 shaman who has a full spell book. So those rowdy outdoor types at the Shaman's Crucible started a <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=0083431f9ea67384d364ba6fe5194510&amp;threadid=19114">petition</a> hoping that Verant will show some pity and make their end-game spells a bit more common.<p>Okay, I'm game. C'mon, Verant, help these folks out! Sure they complain about buffing you, and they smell <a href="http://www.nicotinewater.com/">horrible</a>, but most of 'em are pretty nice once you get below the first couple layers of dirt.<p>Wow. For all this press, I better be getting full shaman buffs without asking for like the next month. Get busy, shamans!<p><BIG>EQ Addicts, Unite!</BIG><p>Just about every message board has one. No, I'm not talking about trolls--most boards have more than their share, including Mobhunter. I'm talking about threads on how many AAXP points you have.<p>The latest thread to roll out at the Safehouse <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9539.topic">details</a> not only how many points folks have, it provides l33t strategies on the best ways to accumulate them. According to Thott, the guildleader of the uberguild called <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">Afterlife</a>, area of effect spells are still the best way to rack up the points (he has 91)--despite Verant's best attempts to nerf this technique.<p>Why am I bringing up this thread? Well, it's a Slow News Day for one thing, and the debates usually end up being at least mildly amusing. On the one side, you have the &quot;get a life&quot; people who secretly wish they had three computers and all day to play, and on the other you have the &quot;you're just jealous&quot; people who never wash their hair and had their voice lines disconnected because no one calls them anyway.<p>But once in a great, great while you find people who have a lot of points but are cool about it--and maybe that's why I'm bringing up this thread. Of course, now that I've said that, it will probably degenerate into the typical <a href="http://www.blogjam.com/cute_little_kittens/">angry flamefest</a>.<p><BIG>Is Your AC Going Soft?</BIG><p>Speaking of Afterlife, another of their members--a monk named Denzalo--started a rather interesting <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=20488.topic">thread</a> over at Monkly-Business which features the following controversial tidbit:<p><B>I just heard from a 100% reliable source that there really is a AC soft cap and it hasn't been raised since RoK. It sits at about 1100 (maybe closer to 1150) for monks and 1200 for warriors. Anything over that amount is 10% of face value. For example lets say you have 1600ac buffed, that extra 500 is actually 50 real AC. So 1600ac is really 1150ac. This is done to prevent players from becoming ungodly tanks. Now let's look at the AA archtype skill stability. At max it will give you 10% more mitigation. This means that your soft cap will raise 10%. So the 1100 will turn into 1210. The 1600ac monk will then have 1249 real AC. In order to have a nonAA'd monk to match that mitigation, he would have to have 2590ac! Unbelievable but true.</B><p>A debate naturally ensued, and flames quickly started to spread (see statements about trolls above). Seems that Kreugan from Fires of Heaven once posted his logs showing the apparent effects of AC scaling up to 1500 or so, which seemed to illustrate that there is no soft cap. So followers of the FoH results flamed the soft cap folks, and soft cappers flamed back. Just another day at the monk boards.<p>Which side is right? Hellifiknow. It seems that the results you get depend pretty heavily on your ATK versus the AC of the mob, or vice versa, or something like that. These number-crunching threads lose me somewhere around page two--and that's on a good day. But if you feel like debating the scientific relevance of finite data sets, or how many tetrion particles are emitted by a breaching warp core, then best of luck to you.<p>Wow, we got through yet another Slow News Day. If Absor doesn't post some juicy rant fodder tomorrow, don't be surprised to find the Mobhunter staff on the evening news as we're hauled away for indecent exposure in a convenience store. <I>That's</I> how committed we are to bringing you <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3801/the_lord_of_the_rings.html">news</a>, folks.
