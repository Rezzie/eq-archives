Here's the author's take on Sony's master plan:<p><B>Now, who remembers Legends? Show of hands? Good. Legends was not a haven for the Uber at Heart. Legends is a marketing experiment. Once again you begin to see the light. Last month Brenlo announced there would be no Guide Programme for SWG. Guess what kind of Customer Service they will have there? You pay for premium service, say $40 a month and you get 24/7 Customer service. Any bells ringing yet? You don't pay for the premium service, then you can e-mail your complaint to someone who cares, only thing is, Verant/Sony isnt planning on hiring these caring individuals because they... cost money.</B><p>The post charges various people in the CS department with maliciousness and ineptitude. Others claiming to have experience in the Guide program chimed in later in the thread with similar claims.<p>How much of this is true? Beats me. Remember, we're not caring about verifiable information in this roundup. Feel the freedom of anarchy! Revel in the chaos!<p><BIG>Ubermobs Back, Beefed Up!</BIG><p>As we noted last night, Ssra Temple and Sanctus Seru went down briefly so that the Emperor and Lord Seru could have their vulerabilities fixed. Well, according to an e-mail from one of our readers, at least one of them was uberfied:<p><B>I don't know about Seru as we haven't gone there yet, but we dropped the Emperor last night on [servername withheld].  He seemed slightly harder than before.  Magic was definitely NOT landing on him, so it looks like they've got his resist weaknesses fixed.</B><p>So not only did Verant keep the Emp killed at the behest of uberguilds so that gimps couldn't gain access to Vex Thal, but they brought him back a little tougher than before. Could the members of Fires of Heaven have paid Verant to make VT more exclusive?<p>Thankfully, we don't have to prove anything--we can just tell you the rumors. Wheeeeeeee! Writing stuff like this is fun!<p><BIG>VI to Druids: No Heal for Joo!</BIG><p>We'll break our theme for just a moment here to report an actual fact: the vendor that was selling the 75% CH spell for druids is no longer on Test server.<p>As you'd expect, <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=28730.topic">druids noticed this</a>, and are worried it means that Verant has decided the spell would be overpowering if moved to the live servers. A Test server cleric named Candarie <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=f362775a2c20fbfcf04487205e228267&amp;threadid=11958">answered some questions</a> about the spell:<p><B>* Is it used in chains? On what targets / how many druids / cleric if so? <p>Yes, tho most of them pitch a heavy fit about having to do it. We use a pair of druids in a spot that one cleric would have filled. Both druids fire at the same time so the healed amount is large enough to matter. <p>* What are your DRUID friends (not dr00ds but DRUID) thinking of the heal? <p>The druids really love it, but some I know are clamoring for group heal now. <p>* What is your PERSONAL opinion? <p>The Druid/Shaman CH is a class killer. I am glad it did not go live, and its availability has been removed from test, but those that have it are keeping it.</B><p>Seems that the spell was having a big effect on mid-level guilds, allowing them to kill relatively tough targets with much greater ease.<p>Is the druid spell really gone, or is there some other plan for testing it further? Why should we try to find out when we can simply incite you to panic instead? So go ahead--panic!<p><BIG>Planes of Power--No Mobs!</BIG><p>Sure, maybe you've seen all the fancy <a href="http://eqemu.sourceforge.net/planes/">screenshots of the upcoming PoP zones</a>. But did you happen to notice anything interesting about those shots? That's right, the zones are <B>virtually empty!</B> Barely a mob is shown anywhere! Does Verant really expect us to pay for empty zones with no loot drops?<p>I don't believe all that crap about those pictures being taken with some kind of emulator--those look like the real deal to me! I bet Verant is going to ship it as is and itemize it later. Yet another unfinished expansion! Looks like we'll be SoL again.<p><BIG>Verant Nerfs Player Exp Yet Again!</BIG><p>Why can't VI ever give players a break? The poor folks in <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/">Triton</a> were innocently trying to <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/images/sh.jpg">get a little exp</a> until Verant came along and nerfed it! Why are they always trying to keep AE exp groups down? They obviously hate all caster classes--except clerics, who of course are VI's new pet class.<p>(Okay, so this one is actually sort of true and verifiable. But it's still funny!)<p><BIG>Rumors By the Pound!</BIG><p>We can't verify any of the following rumors, but we've seen them on enough message boards by now to know that they <B>must</B> be true:<p>Fungus tunic is about to be <B>made nodrop</B>... feign death <B>fails more</B> after latest patch... clerics can <B>solo CT</B>--the god, not the zone... beastlord warders are <B>replacing warriors</B> maintanking the AoW... new level 65 rogue skill will be <B>quadruple backstab</B>... your epic is going to be <B>upgraded</B> next patch... PoM entrance is <B>moving</B> to the bottom of Befallen... the Sleeper can be <B>returned to his bubble</B> if you get Veeshan to spawn in Plane of Sky.<p>There are more rumors out there, but there's only so much we can cover in one night. I hope you guys are happy--some of you have been begging us to write stories like this for a long time now. Sure, this might set my Verant job application back a bit, but we felt we owed you the truth for once!<p>Or versions of it, anyway...
