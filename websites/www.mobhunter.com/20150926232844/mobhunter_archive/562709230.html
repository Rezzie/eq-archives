He apparently sees invis and cons indifferent to everyone, though he will assist another dragon if you are attacking or being attacked by one.<p>More interesting than what he looks like, however, is what he has to say. Ratamah provided the following quest dialogue:<p><B>[Tue Sep 11 19:19:19 2001] You say, 'Hail, Melalafen'<br>[Tue Sep 11 19:19:20 2001] Melalafen says 'We are aware of your presence, fleshling. <br>[Tue Sep 11 19:20:14 2001] You say, 'who are you ?'<br>[Tue Sep 11 19:20:15 2001] Melalafen says 'We are those who have been in hiding. We are those who have been in waiting. We are those who await the return of our Master. <br>[Tue Sep 11 19:20:28 2001] You say, 'who is your master ?'<br>[Tue Sep 11 19:20:28 2001] Melalafen says 'Our Master? Surely all know of our Master now. It was he who was sleeping. It is he who is now freed. We give him honor, loyalty, and our lives. Jaled'Dar, first of our order, set in motion the events that freed our Master. But the Master has departed quickly, perhaps to challenge the Mother herself, such is his power. We wish to aid our Master, but we fear he is not aware that we exist, for his last memory of Wyrmkind was one of treachery and defeat. We believe we know where he has gone, but we do not know how to reach him. <br>[Tue Sep 11 19:36:11 2001] You say, 'where has he gone ?'<br>[Tue Sep 11 19:36:11 2001] Melalafen says 'We believe that he is in a far distant plane, beyond the powers of even the mightiest dragon to reach. He goes places only Veeshan herself was able to visit. We believe he searches for our long departed Mother, to challenge her for rule of the very heavens. If only we had some means of reaching him, we would give him all our aid! We doubt your pitiful mammal brain is capable of devising a plan where we have failed, but we will listen to your chatter, such is our desperation.</B><p>Merileaf added the following:<p><B>What scale?<br>Melalafen says 'You have a scale? A scale from Kerafrym himself? His long slumber, or the battles after he was freed, must have weakened him a great deal! One such as our Master does not shed. If this is true, and you possess what you say, there is hope for us. With his scale, we can create a focus which gives us a chance to locate him in the far ether. But wait! If you have his scale, you must have been in his tomb! You are the ones who were responsible for freeing him, yes? If this is so, we owe you a great debt, for carrying out Jaled'Dar's plan. Give us his scale, and we shall reward you well. We also require the key Jaled'Dar crafted for you to enter the tomb. His tomb is a holy place, and the likes of you should not be allowed to further defile it. We shall not compromise, the key and the scale, o'</B><p>The quote seems to end abruptly.<p>So Kerafyrm is off to do battle with Veeshan herself. The Wurm Queen is the ruler of the Plane of Sky, though she doesn't actually live there; her size (watch the movie that comes with the original EverQuest CD) prohibits her from fitting into any zone imaginable. The Sleeper must be eating his Wheaties and buffing up for the big fight.<p>Interestingly, the things Melalafen says sound a bit like what I <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-1882000724">suggested</a> Verant should do with the Sleeper quest. Call me a prophet if you like.<p>What's unclear is whether Melalafen was intended to be up on all servers, or just the Rathe--the only server on which the Sleeper was actually awakened. Clearly, <a href="http://www.synergizedsolutions.com/simpsons/pictures/others/sideshowmel.gif">Mel</a> shouldn't be talking about his Master being off fighting Veeshan while Kerafyrm is still snoozing in his tomb on most servers.<p>And what about the quest he gives? Besides a scale that is apparently left behind when the Sleeper leaves his tomb, the quest requires the player to turn in the key to Sleeper's Tomb. While replacing a key isn't a big deal to any guild capable of obtaining one in the first place, giving up a hard-earned key to Sleeper's Tomb--which required giving up a hard-earned dragon talisman--has to sting a bit.<p>I'd imagine some folks on the Rathe server will be attempting this quest, assuming Kerafyrm left some scales behind when he took off.<p>Now that Mobhunter's favorite.. uh... mob is back in business, expect updates as soon as we get them.
