<html><head><title>Your Sunday Paper</title></head><body><h1>Your Sunday Paper</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-06-23</p><BIG>Sexy New Interface Simplifies Cyb0r</BIG><p>By now you've probably seen the screenshot of the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/screenshots/TheCoders.JPG">new user interface</a> over at Allakhazam's, and have read some of the <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=17815.topic">discussion</a> about it. It looks pretty sweet--new buff/spell icons that just might be easier to identify, multiple chat windows, a quick way to invite/disband people to and from your group, and more. It's hard to tell what the whole interface will be like based on this one screenshot, but it certainly promises to be an improvement over what we have now.<p>It's natural to compare what we can see of the new interface to that of other games on the horizon, but that's kind of like apples and oranges. Whatever Verant ultimately comes up with has to match the functionality of EverQuest as it currently exists, whereas upcoming games have a lot more leeway as to what features their UI has. Hey, as long as it takes less mouseclicks to get where I want to go, and as long as stupid stuff like tiny trade windows goes away, I'll likely be happy with it. Casters in particular are counting the days until the goofy spellbook of today is nothing more than a bad memory.<br> <br><BIG>Have Van, Will Travel</BIG><p>A reader named Forrest sent in his observations after going to the first stop of the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/eqinvasion/">EQ Invasion Tour</a> in San Diego. He reports seeing about eight staffers, only a couple of which appeared to be actual Sony employees--the rest being part of a promotional group. Attendees were being interviewed both on camera and off, and were asked if they played EQ, what their favorite things about EQ are, and whether anyone would like a free copy of EQ Classic. Forrest continues:<p><B>There are 12 stations at which you can play a very small scale world of EQ.  Each account they have has 4 level 8-15 characters, all equipped in their newbie quest armor (the gnome SK I played had every piece of Plague Knight armor) and weaponry for the level, such as mino axes.  They told me that only 12 zones were up in the demo world, which starts characters in North Qeynos.  I was able to travel to South Qeynos, Qeynos Hills, Blackburrow and Everfrost. Permafrost, qey2hh1, and qcat were all down, so I'm not sure what other zones they had up (unless it was erudxing and those connecting zones.  Each playable character has limited GM level commands, such as /buff, /zone, /kill, etc... as it was, you basically just ran around killing fire beetles and bats, then got mashed by guards when you attacked them.  Only 1 hr from when it started, almost all the playable characters were naked, so it was clearly just to attract new subscribers.  There wasn't much for die hard EQ players -- no events planned.  They were giving away free stickers (two types), free temp tattoos (two types), free EQ classic CDs, and a little blue foam armchair thing that you can put a cell phone in.</B><p>Well, that doesn't sound overly thrilling for most experienced players, but it just might win over some new subscribers (especially if those naked newbies are elven females--rowwrrrr!). The Mobhunter staff still plans to attend the Minneapolis stop. After all, it's our policy never to turn down a free temporary tattoo when we find one.<p>Thanks for the info, Forrest. You get the MAK award of the day!<p><BIG>Burn, Baby, Burn</BIG><p>The Alternative Advancement abilities introduced in Luclin range in usefulness from marginal at best to startlingly powerful. From a &quot;make the mob dead&quot; standpoint, nothing is more impressive than the wizard ability of Manaburn, which takes all the wizzy's mana and delivers one massive blast, often of the five-digit variety.<p>A dozen determined folks over on the Prexus server illustrated just how potent Manaburn can be by teaming up to <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=17752.topic">nuke the hell out of Sontalak</a>. As anyone who has taken on ToV's watchdog knows, this dragon is no pushover, but these rabid casters got him down to 1% health in no time, then used standard nukes to finish him off. Yes, they had a support staff present, but this is still an impressive accomplishment.<p>This would have been a really cool <a href="http://www.catboxing.com/">fight</a> to see. While some fear of a resultant nerf to Manaburn is understandable (though Verant has stated this is unlikely), it's too bad that the thread at Graffe's turned from a congratulatory pat on the back into a pissing contest. But I guess that sort of thing is the norm nowadays; anytime I see a 9+ page EZboard thread, I start to break out in hives.<p><BIG>Sing Us a Song, You're the Fansyman</BIG><p>For a sheer sadistic thrill, check out the further adventures of <a href="http://www.notacult.com/fansy3.htm">Fansy the Famous</a>, scourge of the evil and neutral teams on the Sullon Zek server. In this installment, Fansy makes friends with Rivervale's Priest of Discord and proceeds to make some corpses. Many corpses. Many, many corpses.<p>Some folks--including the GM staff--on Sullon Zek may disagree, but I think this page is a riot. It's almost enough to make me play a bard on a PvP server... almost.<p>Say it with me now... you know you want to... <B>GO GO GOOD TEAM!</B><p>All things considered, writing news on a steamy Minnesota Sunday isn't really so bad after all. It's better than breaking a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1556/2918056.html">sweat</a>, anyway.
