<h1 class="article_title">Loral's Declaration of Principles</h1>
<p>by Loral on February 24, 2005</p>

<p>In the movie Citizen Kane, Charles Foster Kane writes a front page editorial in his newspaper called the "Declaration of Principles".  I often thought about what my duty as a writer for Mobhunter includes.  What do I offer the readers of these articles?  What is my purpose?  </p>

<p>I have written forty six articles in the past year.   In a few comments over this last year, my objectivity and my purpose are questioned by those who obviously do not agree with my views.  While I have little chance of convincing these people that my views are correct, at least I can explain both my purpose and perspective.</p>

<p>So in marking my one year anniversary as a writer for Mobhunter, I offer to you my Declaration of Principles:</p>

<p>I.  I will attempt to help players better enjoy Everquest.</p>

<p>II.  I will attempt to help Sony Online Entertainment make Everquest a better game.</p>

<p>Some may feel that the purpose of editorials like these are to put the screws to SOE much as a free press keeps a government in check.  SOE isn't the government, it's a company with a product.  I make the assumption that by reading articles about Everquest, you too enjoy the game.  If I did not enjoy this game, I would not bother to write articles about it nor would I expect you to read them.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish the objectives above, I will perform the following actions:</p>

<p>I will write articles and editorials weekly or bi-weekly on the latest Everquest news or topics.</p>

<p>I will write bi-annual "Loral's Evil Agendas" with general suggestions for areas of improvement.</p>

<p>I will offer up several paths for communication from the readers of my articles including emails to loral@loralciriclight.com, in-game tells to "Loral" on Quellious, and comments on each article.</p>

<p>Here is what I will NOT do:</p>

<p>I will not say something I do not believe.</p>

<p>I will not bash anything or anyone without purpose or reason.</p>

<p>I will not focus on any one class, level range, or style of play.  I will attempt to focus on the game as a whole.</p>

<p>I will try not to waste people's time.</p>

<p>In return for my effort on these articles and the time others spend reading them, I ask for something in return.  When commenting here on Mobhunter, over at the EQ Live forums, or sending feedback to SOE, consider the following guidelines:</p>

<p>1.  When offering feedback, clearly state what problem you have or what solution you desire.</p>

<p>2.  Act with the information you possess.  Do not use false statistics or misrepresentations of the player base.</p>

<p>3.  Speak in detail. Do not overgeneralize.</p>

<p>4.  Do not use overdramatic metaphors.  Let us toss "slap in the face" and "red headed step child" onto the piles of Gehenna where they belong.</p>

<p>5.  Do not write with emotion, speak with facts and detail.</p>

<p>6.  Do not use threats.  Ever since Furor's "I will leave in 18 days unless you fix Time", everything else pales in comparison.</p>

<p>7.  Ask yourself what purpose your note serves or how it will help improve the game.  Do not use feedback simply to vent.</p>

<p>8.  Avoid overdramatics.  SOE doesn't hate you, your playstyle, or your class.</p>

<p>9.  Maintain your perspective.  Every one of us has important views, but it is only OUR view, not the view of all players.  Never assume everyone is just like you.</p>

<p>10.  Remember that this is a game.  It isn't a civil rights movement.  It isn't the federal, state, or local government.  Remember that you vote with your dollar.</p>

<p>In the movie Citizen Kane, Charles Foster Kane states that he will act as a champion of the people to protect their rights as citizens and as human beings.  No one person in the Everquest community can act as this champion.  No Everquest player requires such a champion.  </p>

<p>Every one of us acts as our own champion.  We vote with our dollar.  We have multiple vehicles to offer feedback.  Do not look to any one person or group to act as your champion.  Act as your own champion and tell SOE exactly what you want.</p>

<p>

<p>
<p>In number 9 I belive you meant to say 'perspective' instead of 'prospective'.</p>

<p>I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I normally find your editorials/articles worthwhile and somewhat informative.  My biggest issue with the site since you took it over from Moorgard has been that there's news happening out there that doesn't seem to make it into your weekly/bi-weekly post.  While that annoys me, I don't blame you for it, and I don't consider you a rabid fanboi or anything of the sort.  Not everyone has time to go troll all the different forums out there, not even the official ones most of the time.  Ultimately the source of my frustration is not Mobhunter, but MMORPG fansites in general, the majority of which have in my opinion gone from being useful places for news and information about the game to being vehicles for poorly- or half-written editorials that leave the reader wanting for more.  While I don't have the resources (or really, the time) to run my own fansite, it bothers me that I feel like I can write a better editorial on the changes in a patch message and how they'll effect players than i can read on any of several sites from people who do it all the time AND have an audience.  Mine just get posted to a guild website (unless I cross-post to official forums, but those are usually about mechanics), and occasionally people see them and comment, but very few do.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the fact that I still visit Mobhunter, even though I no longer actively play EQ (and in fact now spend time in three different games, of which EQ2 is only one) should hopefully illustrate my faith that you will continue to provide relatively unbiased views of the goings-on of EverQuest.</p>

<p>Thanks for the affirmation.<br />
</p>

<p>
<p>Where to begin?<br />
You ask things to your posters then I guess we might be entitled to the same courtesy:</p>

<p><br />
"I will not bash anything or anyone without purpose or reason."</p>

<p>Calling people that disagree with you cynics doesn't set a good example, now does it?</p>

<p>"Do not use false statistics or misrepresentations of the player base."</p>

<p>Ditto.</p>

<p>"Do not overgeneralize."</p>

<p>Talk about your playstyle, fine, but don't make it as if it's the one of the majority nor that's the better for the game if you please.</p>

<p>"speak with facts and detail"</p>

<p>That's in fact why we post. We often cover facts and details you (sometimes intentionaly?) leave out of your editorials. Namely raid content, bugs, a number of gameplay issues, all sorts of other things that may give a more objective perspective than one-sided fanboism.</p>

<p>"Ask yourself what purpose your note serves or how it will help improve the game. "</p>

<p>Well that's the problem, really. When an editorial turns into a selling pitch, that can't possibly help the game to really improve. Reason why what you call cynics actually are doing your job.</p>

<p>" Never assume everyone is just like you."</p>

<p>Indeed. It works both ways. Same problem as mentionned above and moreover the intent of force feeding your view of what the new content should be is the root of biased and untruthful editorials that get smashed for what they are. Those who are objective and more balanced don't. Not surprisingly.</p>

<p>In conclusion, enthousiasm are enjoyable to read, blind fanboism or just completely one sided editorials aren't. To ask something from others, you might need to set yourself the example. Which remain to be seen if you intend to change yourself as you try to change the nature of the game content.</p>

<p>Fixed the typo, thank you Talaen.</p>

<p>You're right about calling people cynics, Redcloud.  The people I had in mind are the continuing "EQ is dead" crowd, who ARE cynics, but not everyone who disagrees with me is a cynic so I removed it.</p>

<p>I can't always cover every piece of news that happens in a week and often pieces get cut out.  If you think there is a topic worth covering, always feel free to send me an email to loral@loralciriclight.com.  If I don't cover it, at least I will send you an email and explain why.</p>

<p>There are a few things I won't cover.  When there are bugs that SOE clearly knows about and has already addressed on the EQLive forums, I don't know that there is value in bringing them up here.  If there are topics I am simply unqualified to discuss, I usually won't get into them (details of raid content is one of these).  </p>

<p>I do have a general idea of the number of players at various levels and playstyles based on numbers I received from SOE.  Those statistics somtimes guide what I will cover and what I will not.  Even still, I won't discount any one playstyle but as far as raiding goes, there are many champions of raiding that hold SOE's ear far better than I could.</p>

<p>I believe in constructive criticism.  While I wrote a positive review (a review I still stand behind) for Omens of War, I also followed up with an article outlining the problems with that expansion in "The Warts Under the Emperor's Clothes".  Many of the problems mentioned in that article were addressed in Dragons of Norrath, including the time requirements to play and the lack of purpose in expeditions.</p>

<p>In my preview of Dragons, I was very positive about it (again, I still am).  It often takes a couple of weeks to see all of the rough edges once I see and understand these rough edges I will bring them up in a more critical article.</p>

<p>Again, Redcloud, it appears from your comments that the primary thing you have a problem with is that I don't cover raid content or stand as a champion of that particular playstyle.  There are certainly other websites that cover the details of raid content better than I ever could.  As for my views on it, I believe what I believe.  We simply disagree.</p>

<p>Loral, a good friend of mine has a saying that I believe works wonderful in these types of settings (eq, devs, cynics, etc) that he uses at work (not publicly).  And that is, "Everyone is entitled to their opinion no matter how stupid, ignorant, and worthless it might be."  Hehe, just thought that was funny.  Keep up the good work, Loral. (get rid of the bad...lol)  Thanks for writing this stuff.  Now if I can only get my company to serve nachos all day... or at least at lunch. :)</p>

<p>Loral I read you articles with pleasure, and know that you are passionate about the game we all love and hate at times.  </p>

<p>So how on earth at point five can you say do not write with EMOTION?</p>

<p>If your passionate about something it affects you emotionally, this will come out in anything that a person writes in response to a comment or aspect of the game they are unhappy with.</p>

<p>You yourself are guilty of writing with emotion.</p>

<p>I think every writer has to lay themselves out to possible criticism.  I'm sure actors, artists, game developers and all creative people feel the same way about criticism.  Keep up the good work Loral and I'm glad it isn't me who has to write this every week.</p>

<p>I guess the degree of disagreement is a matter of perspective too.</p>

<p>"The people I had in mind are the continuing "EQ is dead" crowd, who ARE cynics, but not everyone who disagrees with me is a cynic so I removed it."</p>

<p>They are indeed bitter and often for good reasons but that doesn't make it right nor healthy. So in that it's not really a disagreement to me.</p>

<p>"I can't always cover every piece of news that happens in a week and often pieces get cut out. If you think there is a topic worth covering, always feel free to send me an email to loral@loralciriclight.com. If I don't cover it, at least I will send you an email and explain why."</p>

<p>I'm not a big fan of emails. Often different people have different insights on the same topic and I enjoy thought provoking counter-arguments as much as defending my views. Reason why I'd rather comment in posts as they are here.</p>

<p>"There are a few things I won't cover. When there are bugs that SOE clearly knows about and has already addressed on the EQLive forums, I don't know that there is value in bringing them up here. If there are topics I am simply unqualified to discuss, I usually won't get into them (details of raid content is one of these)."</p>

<p>That's why I nailed you once over a post on raid content difficulty, but that's another matter.<br />
Take DoN. Your editorial was ringing too much as a selling pitch rather than the list of practical benefits for gamers. People may care to loose the arena in the bazaar, that the bazaar is a mess as is. That the summon corpse feature is a blast, that the DON augments are considerably better than LDON, etc.</p>

<p>"I do have a general idea of the number of players at various levels and playstyles based on numbers I received from SOE. Those statistics somtimes guide what I will cover and what I will not. Even still, I won't discount any one playstyle but as far as raiding goes, there are many champions of raiding that hold SOE's ear far better than I could."</p>

<p>I doubt you write these editorials for SoE if you can email them directly. The main audience here is the playerbase, not SoE.<br />
Despite our frequent disagreements there aren't that many sites with editorials with current EQ content. So in short I'm stuck with you and you with me P).</p>

<p>"Many of the problems mentioned in that article were addressed in Dragons of Norrath, including the time requirements to play and the lack of purpose in expeditions."</p>

<p>No doubt that in a number of cases SoE listens and improves the gameplay since Omens. I still hate the "anti-immersiveness" of point systems within a RPG MMO but I won't deny they provided worthwhile content in DoN so far. Immersion is an order of magnitude better than in LDON. And it brought back a few people. So it's all good on that front.</p>

<p>"In my preview of Dragons, I was very positive about it (again, I still am). It often takes a couple of weeks to see all of the rough edges once I see and understand these rough edges I will bring them up in a more critical article."</p>

<p>I would be curious to read that one. All the more that a number of issues remain pending about DoN, first of which the faction system.</p>

<p>"Again, Redcloud, it appears from your comments that the primary thing you have a problem with is that I don't cover raid content or stand as a champion of that particular playstyle. There are certainly other websites that cover the details of raid content better than I ever could. As for my views on it, I believe what I believe. We simply disagree."</p>

<p>I don't expect you to cover in any depth raid content rather than aknowledging its existence, its playerbase, its community-rich value, the benefits of having a strong raid content going for people to switch from single group to raid playstyles. In short to aknowledge that it's due to raiding and guilds that EQ owes its a large part of its longevity and that systematically undermining that playstyle for the single group casual crowd is bad for the game. It's changing the nature of the game and a dumping down of its longevity no matter what amount of single group content they may provide. That is the kind of objectivity I expect from you when you don't try to openly marginalize that playstyle. And yes I suppose we'll keep disagreeing and I'll keep setting the records straight if only for the sake of completeness. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy reading you, Loral, even if I rail into a number of subjects for the reasons stated above P)</p>

<p>"In short to aknowledge that it's due to raiding and guilds that EQ owes its a large part of its longevity and that systematically undermining that playstyle for the single group casual crowd is bad for the game. "</p>

<p>It is there that we disagree, but I certainly acknowledge the viewpoint.  I hear it quite often.</p>

<p>"I would be curious to read that one. All the more that a number of issues remain pending about DoN, first of which the faction system. "</p>

<p>I am already collecting some of the issues they are working on, but faction is not one of them.  I have yet to see a compelling reason why entire guilds chose only one faction instead of letting their members work on either side.  For years people asked for faction to make more of a difference.  Any problems we see are problems with having both good guys and bad guys as playable races.  In any case, you will see an article with some problems and areas for improvement within DoN.</p>

<p>People also seem to forget that I outlined the largest problem within Dragons of Norrath: the lack of content for players below 45.  People are quick to dismiss that criticism because they simply don't care.  I do.  I think a lot of other players care as well.</p>

<p>"I doubt you write these editorials for SoE if you can email them directly. The main audience here is the playerbase, not SoE. "</p>

<p>The champions of raiding I was referring to are the high visibility guilds who post their latest exploits on their homepages as well as some of the summit representatives who continually champion the call of the raider above all other content.</p>

<p>"Take DoN. Your editorial was ringing too much as a selling pitch rather than the list of practical benefits for gamers. "</p>

<p>I took the points I discussed about DoN all as practical benefits to gamers.  The guild hall, potion belt, bandoleer, corpse summoner, guild message board, email system, missions, mission point vendors, and tradeskill additions are all very useful features for a lot of the players of EQ.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, I also criticized them on the lack of content below 45.  Glowing advertisement propaganda wouldn't mention a problem as large as that.</p>

<p>In any case, I mainly wrote this article to inform readers that if they expect to read brutal articles that put the screws into SOE and air out all of their dirty laundry, they can go read the two hundred negative posts a day over on EQLive.</p>

<p>I'm here to help people enjoy Everquest and to help SOE make it a better game.</p>

<p>By the way, I generally hate big introspective conversations that stroke my ego.  This is a mid-week article that won't take the place of the regular Monday article I plan to write.  Monday we will return to talking about topics of importance, like Brenlo's new articles, the server mergers, and last night's dev chat.</p>

<p>My only concern with this is that you state two objectives, three things you will do, and four things you won't.  Then you follow that up with TEN things that you want from your readers.  This seems less like a declaration of principles and more like a contract.  I don't think Mr. Kane asked his readers to follow more rules than he set down for himself.</p>

<p>I always appreciate your site and comments about the genesis of EQ.  My account is set to expire this coming week and I have not yet decided if I will renew or not.  Coming here and reading all the comments has been huge in my decision process.</p>

<p>This past week I logged in after a few weeks off and I was pleasantly surprised to see that 29 of my guild mates were there happily raiding away.  I was a bit too late for the first raid but I joined them for the second one.  I really missed them and it was great to see them all again.  The numbers of folks playing was the most pleasant part of the surprise because we are not one of the uber raiding guilds.</p>

<p>I walked into the bazaar and thought I had gone into the wrong place.  I sure dont remember any of you saying anything about the changes there.  I still cant say if I like it or not but it was still a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>Now I ask you all once again, how do you like the new DoN?  I see some mention of the new features but I dont seem to see too much one way or the other on actually liking it.  Is it fun?  Is it fair to both single and small guilds as well as to  the big raiders?</p>

<p>Is there a new spell for me that would make my cleric worth having around?  IM still cranky about the spells from GoD of which I have maybe one or two max.  I really dont think I got my moneys' worth out of GoD and while I did manage to die a lot in OOW Im not so sure of the value there either.</p>

<p>Can you believe it, 9 additions now to EQ.  </p>

<p>Keep up the good work all of you.  This is the only eq related site I read and I value the info here greatly.</p>

<p>Congradulations on you first year Loral.  I really enjoy reading this site, and I enjoy the comments of your's and serveral other people that write in. </p>

<p>Yes so far I really like DoN.  The missions seem a bit hard, but then they are brand knew and that may change with experience.  I love the Guild halls, our is being used so much, that is almost like we have a large guild LOL.  I have not used the potion holder but I have used the bandolier, and love it.   I also LOVE what they did with the maps.  It is like having Black&white tv all your life and finally getting a Color TV.  WoW</p>

<p>
<p>Always2XS wins, although I don't necessarily agree with the same results.  The answer is nine.</p>

<p>He didn't clearly state a problem or offer a solution.</p>

<p>He didn't act with the information possessed (he jumps to the conclusion that SOE hates rangers without offering facts to back it up).</p>

<p>He didn't speak in detail.</p>

<p>He didn't use an overdramatic metaphor, I don't count him as having violated guideline number 4.</p>

<p>He wrote with emotion instead of speakin in facts and detail.</p>

<p>He used a threat.</p>

<p>He probably didn't ask himself what purpose his note served.  It certainly doesn't help improve the game.</p>

<p>He certainly didn't avoid overdramatics. (SOE wants to get rid of rangers?)</p>

<p>He didn't maintain his own perspective.  I doubt he speaks for all rangers yet he groups them into his statement.</p>

<p>I argue that his statement goes way beyond the feedback a consumer offers to a game producer.  While he may vote with his dollar, he isn't necessarily voting with his feet if he comes here to make a statement like that.</p>

<p>Overall, though, I counted 9 out of 10 and Always2XS's answer met that count.   Always2XS wins the contest and his prize will be in the mail on Monday (assuming I can acquire his address).</p>

<p>Thanks for playing!!</p>
