First came this one:<p><B>February 15th, 7:00 pm<br>------------------------------<p>- Released a new version of the graphics DLL that improves framerate.<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>Results from the new DLL seem pretty positive. A number of my guildmates had bad problems after Wednesday's patch, but the new file seems to have taken care of most of that.<p>Next came this little bugger on Sunday:<p><B>February 17th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>- Increased the drop rate on some 55-60th level Kunark spells that were overly rare.<br>- Added water and high quality ore to vendors in the Bazaar, as promised in the Feb 13 patch.<br>- Fixed a spawn problem in north Temple of Veeshan.<br>- Fixed a few minor issues with the Whistling Fists quest.<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>This one we weren't expecting--changes of this nature are usually reserved for scheduled patches. Hmm, I wonder if that bit about spells caught the <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=bfc9472fd94889e7972c25aaf5961cd9&amp;threadid=20122">attention</a> of shamans? Do ya think?<p>Yes, our barbaric buffing buddies gave up sitting in GFay auctioning for malo, torpor, and tigirs long enough to test out the spell drops. Preliminary results seem to indicate that the Emperor in Sebilis is dropping his rare goodies more frequently, and the juggernauts may be as well. More killing will be required before shamans let themselves get too hopeful. <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=12991.topic">Wizards</a> and <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=26531.topic">druids</a> are on the lookout for improvements, too.<p>Changes surfaced in ToV as well, The patch message mostly refers to the Ring of Fire-like replacement for gimpy old Vulak, with a few ubers <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=9883.topic&amp;start=26&amp;stop=48">reporting</a> that they have gotten through at least three waves of the nasty mobs. The problem was that the mobs would despawn randomly or too quickly, and this patch seems to have taken care of that.<p>As for the bit about the Whistling Fists quest, you can check out a <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm7.showMessage?topicID=3428.topic">spoiler</a> if you like, or just test the waters to see if you can figure it out for yourself. Dare to dream, young munkee.<p><BIG>The Adventure Weekend That Came and Went</BIG><p>Unlike last Halloween's events, which drew the attention of high levels and low levels alike, this Adventure Weekend went by without a lot of fanfare (pardon the expression). The <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=1563729945">announcement</a> itself was pretty low key, and events seemed to follow suit. <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=22202.topic">Reports</a> of another Befallen takeover and some new spawns in the Dreadlands met with mixed results and skepticism on the part of some players (then again, what doesn't?).<p>Regardless of whether or not you participated, hopefully you see such events as a good thing. After all, there's much <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/484/1626729.html">worse stuff</a> that could happen.<p><BIG>Officer, That Man Stole My Parse!</BIG><p>Pretty proud of your level 12 Iksar monk twink with fungus tunic, tranquil staff, and multiquested Velious armor? Then have a peak at some high-end monk <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showMessage?topicID=6862.topic">parsing</a> to bring your breeches back down to size.<p>Of course, <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=22340.topic">naysayers</a> and trolls will always try to put a damper on your party, but don't let them. They're only around to <a href="http://www.amiannoyingornot.com/">irritate</a> you.<br>
