Some very respected members of the community came forth with a screenshot as proof, and wizards everywhere began threatening to cancel their accounts and take up shuffleboard.<p>Leave it to Scott Hartsman, that nasty EQ technical guy, to pop up in his Gallenite identity and <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=18079.topic">ruin all the fun</a>:<p><B>1) That text message doesn't exist in EverQuest.<p>2) Test has been down since 6/28 due to some hardware issues.<p>3) I certainly hope that I'd know if we nerfed Manaburn. <p>We can all safely return to our regularly scheduled insomnia... </B><p>Following Scott's assurance came admissions of guilt on the part of the pranksters, many /rofl posts, and a bunch of bitter folks who felt they were mislead by people they trusted. Really, those guys should have known better. Joking with wizards about manaburn being nerfed is like telling Star Trek fans that Spock ears will no longer be allowed at conventions. It sounds funny until some geek flips out over it.<p><BIG>Testing? We Don't Need No Steenking Testing!</BIG><p>Yes, as mentioned above, Test server is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000617.html">still down</a>. Hartsman cites hardware issues, but speculation as to the <I>real</I> reason why (since of course it must be some kind of conspiracy) includes problems with the new interface, major code changes for the advent of Planes of Power, or the possibility that Test is being used to give the video game media a sneak peak at PoP. If the latter is true, they sure didn't invite Mobhunter to participate. /sniffle<p>Whatever the cause, the denizens of Test needed to find some way to keep busy, so they came up with a <a href="http://pub21.ezboard.com/feqtestregistryfrm14.showMessage?topicID=608.topic">Top 7 List</a> of things to do while Test is down:<p><B>7. Analyze Fironia Vie's upcoming PoP box-art pose.<p>6. Calculate how many Hill Giants you need to kill to afford the horse of your choosing.<p>5. Break down and actually read EQManual_Supplement.doc.<p>4. Surf and resurf the currently ultra-slow popular EQ websites, reading about proddies' experiences with the new UI.<p>3. Scan this messageboard for new threads and actually read all of them.<p>2. Climb and jump off your furniture to practice Safe Fall in real life.<p>And finally, the #1 Thing to Do While Waiting For The Test Server To Come Back Up:<p>1. Bash a hole through a window with your head and scream &quot;GODDAMIT VERANT LET ME IN!!&quot; over and over until you pass out or your neighbors call the police.</B><p>That really wasn't all that funny, so it's good they stopped at seven.<p>If you read the Test server board much, you run across the term &quot;proddies&quot; quite a bit. This is apparently slang for people on production (live) servers, much like the Zek folks refer to non-PvP players as &quot;bluebies.&quot;<p>In keeping with this tradition, I am hereafter going to refer to players on Test server as &quot;testes.&quot; I'm sure I'll have a ball doing so.<p><BIG>Grimlings Still Not Giving Up the Goods</BIG><p>Pretty much the only guild to take on the long key camps and Grimling wars needed to enter and conquer inner Acrylia has been Ring of Valor over on the Bristlebane server. Even though the amount of time spent to accumulate keys to reach the Acrylia bosses is on the magnitude of Emperor and Seru keys, the rewards remain very poor in comparison. So poor, in fact, that pretty much every other sane guild has heeded their warnings and not even bothered to work on those keys.<p>The RoV people still farm the area in hopes that loot will be upgraded or improved in some way. Sadly, things just keep getting worse, including their <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fringofvalor44669frm33.showMessage?topicID=134.topic">latest find</a> which isn't even usable:<p><B>Well last night we kill the Foreman and finally for about 20 seconds we think something uber dropped. A FT 2 robe with so so stats drops... Well, the race is all, and the robe is wizard usable, so we let one of our wizards loot the item. The item will not go into his chest slot.</B><p>Notice how the item is a robe, but doesn't list that it fits the chest slot. Neat trick, that.<p>Not only does Verant need to fix loot like this, they need to do serious work on the whole Acrylia Caverns zone in general. Apart from paladins and clerics who can take on the undead with ease, this is largely a wasted zone. The Ring of Fire has been tweaked numerous times and still sucks--but then pretty much all the RoF-type events suck, apart from the Coldain Ring wars, Ring of Slime in CT, and maybe a couple more. Don't even get me started on the utter disaster that is the Ring of Vulak.<p>It has some nice ideas to be sure, but Acrylia remains one of the most glaringly unfinished parts of the Luclin expansion. It needs to be fixed so that even more guilds don't get burned.<p>That's all I have for you tonight. Stay indoors, drink plenty of fluids, and don't let your CPU overheat. If all else fails, you can always hang out in Halas until September rolls around.
