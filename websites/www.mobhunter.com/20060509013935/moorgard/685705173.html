This guy was cool, smart, and obviously knew his job incredibly well. He could rattle off spell facts and answer player questions like it was second nature to him. He has been a great asset to caster classes in EverQuest.<p>The problem is, he's not EverQuest's spell guru anymore.<p>No, he hasn't left Verant. But according to <a href="http://www.graffe.com/">Graffe's Wizard Compilation</a>, he has moved on to another project:<p><B>It turns out that he will still be working for Verant on an unannounced project doing gameplay systems and mechanics. He seems to be really happy and excited. (before the e-mails start: yes, I asked him about the unannounced project and he didn't share any info.)</B><p>There's a <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=12261.topic&amp;index=29">good-bye thread</a> on Graffe's board if you want to wish Lawrence good luck.<p>Clearly, Mr. Poe is either going to be working on Star Wars: Galaxies or EverQuest 2. Care to place a bet on which?<p>The only good thing about this guy leaving EverQuest is that I get to make all kinds of Poe references in our little News Roundup. You all have <I>no idea</I> how long I've been waiting to do this.<p>And yes, I realize this story is almost a week old. Sorry about that. Sometimes we (meaning Kohath, Csenicier, Tann, and Medik) suck.<p><BIG>Le Tell-Tale Heart</BIG><p>As we have mentioned before, we get letters from our readers. One of the e-mails we received recently was from a French player on the Karana server. He noted that European players often ran into customer service issues because of the language barrier, and at times have been left with little or no support. Issues created by language translation are magnified on servers like Karana that have a heavy non-English speaking population.  And when GM's are contacted with instances of racism and harassment, players find it difficult to break down language barriers and are often left feeling frustrated or dismissed.<br> <br>When Tann, Mobhunter's own interviewer in exile, brought this matter to Verant's attention, they were quick to answer with some good news for European players:<p><b>Greetings, I am the GM of Antonius Bayle, Sony Online's newest EverQuest server and one localized in London, England specifically to address the needs of EverQuest's United Kingdom and Europe-based players.  My online hours are scheduled to coincide with European primetime play hours as are the hours of our volunteer Guide staff.  And while I myself do not speak French fluently, I am familiar enough with the language to be able to gather much of the information and communicate with the French players with whom I have communicated.  I am a fluent Spanish speaker, however, as well as being able to somewhat communicate in Italian due to my family heritage.  If a player is uncomfortable speaking with me in game, they are welcome to e-mail me so I can have the opportunity to translate word for word as well as responding in their native language.  An additional note, several members of our aforementioned Guide staff are native French speakers, as well as speaking several other languages including German, Swedish and Danish, to name a few.<p>Some more good news is that after speaking with the Director of Customer Service about your e-mail, he has authorized me to inform you that our European localization plans have not stopped at Antonius Bayle.  We are currently looking into opening EverQuest servers not only in France or nearby but also in Germany or thereabouts.  Nothing definite has been confirmed as of yet, but everything is looking good so far. I sincerely hope I have answered your questions and allayed some of the concerns presented by your readers.  If not, please do not hesitate to contact me with anything additional.<p>Patrick H. Cirelli<br>GM Drembo, Antonius Bayle<br>Sony Online Entertainment<br>pcirelli@soe.sony.com</b><p>More localized servers will be a good thing. Thanks for the fast response, Patrick. This will help our European readers a lot, I'm sure.<p><BIG>The Fall of the House of Eldin</BIG><p>Well, <a href="http://www.slownewsday.net/">Slow News Day</a> is back--or at least a ghost of it is. While the rant site that was Lum the Mad is still <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/">six feet under</a>, Pika the Mad has returned to fan the embers just a bit. It seems some donation money is missing, and Pika would like to see debts paid and the remaining cash donated to charity.<p>While I'm sure the whole meltdown of this once great site still weighs heavily on those involved, it's really time for the community to let the past go. Nobody wants to see old wounds reopened, especially ones as gangrenous and festering as those caused by SND's collapse. Hopefully the money issues will be handled quietly and we can all move on to brighter days.<p>But, uh, what's with not linking to Mobhunter?<p><BIG>The Purloined Legends</BIG><p>Absor let everyone know that Verant's <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=738364932">elite server</a> is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000483.html">open for business</a>:<p><B>You can sign up for the Legends server right now by going to the <a href="http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/showcase/home.jsp">Legends site</a>. Please read over all the features of the server before signing up. You should also read the <a href="http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/faq.jsp">FAQ</a>.<br></B><p>Signup was supposed to open on February 4th, but apparently there were some issues that crept up. Things seem to be working now, so go ahead and sign your life away.<p><BIG>In Her Sepulchre There by the Sea</BIG><p>The Prexus server has been down for a while. Nobody knows why. Lots of people are <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessage?topicID=15038.topic">speculating</a>, of course.<p>This non-informative story is merely to stem the tide of e-mail from people asking if we know what's going on. When we know, we'll tell ya.<p>That's all for now. Hopefully this Poe-centric roundup has inspired you to go read a book instead of browsing crappy Web sites all day. Hey, wait a minute...<br>
