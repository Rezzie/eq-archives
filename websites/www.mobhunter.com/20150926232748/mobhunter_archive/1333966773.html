Just Read It.</BIG><p><B>December 13th, 12:00am<br>------------------------------<p>** Texture Cache **<p>In an effort to improve loading and zoning times, we've added the ability to cache textures to your hard drive.  One of the things that your computer is doing when you load up the game or change zones is building textures and putting them into RAM on your computer.  Each time you log in or zone the game has to create the textures you need and put them into RAM for use during gameplay.<p>This, obviously, takes a little time.<p>We have added an option that allows you to save that information to your hard drive rather than creating it each time you log in or zone.<p>This does have a few drawbacks.  It will require a lot of hard drive space to store these textures.  In the most extreme case it could use up as much as 1.5 GB of hard drive space, though this would be the extreme.  It could, however, easily use 500 MB of space on your hard drive.  And because writing all this data to your hard drive takes a little time, the first time you use this feature it will take a bit longer<br>to log in.<p>The game will never allow you to fall below 500 MB of space on your hard drive when creating the texture cache.  This is to prevent any problems with a shortage of space on your hard drive.  But it also means that you will need to have plenty of hard drive space free to use this option; 500 MB plus the amount needed for the texture cache.<p>Also, if you change any of your setting for graphics {like changing the texture quality) it will have to rewrite these files, meaning that your first log in after making such a change will take longer than usual as it writes these files to your hard drive.<p>The benefits is that once you have allocated the hard drive space and logged in to create the needed files, the game can then read that information directly into RAM from your hard drive rather than creating them each time you log in or zone.<p>What this feature does not allow you to do is to increase the settings above those that are recommended.  If the game suggests that you only use ten models, turning on the Texture Cache will not make it a good idea to turn on more models.  This feature will not change that.  Those recommendations are based on the amount of RAM you have available and your video card.  The hard drive cache does not effectively add RAM to your machine, it just allows the game to save time creating the textures that your existing RAM and video card use.<p>There are two ways to activate this feature.  You can check the 'Texture Cache' box in the Options screen, or you can turn it on from within the eqclient.ini file.  To activate it, add the following line to the eqclient.ini file:<p>TextureCache=TRUE<p>This could improve load times dramatically depending on your settings.  The more models and graphics features you have turned on, the greater the potential increase in loading times you will see using the Texture Cache.<p>Remember:  This will require a lot of hard drive space, so be certain that you have a lot of free hard drive space if you turn this option on.  The more stuff you enable (models, texture quality, etc.) the more space you will need.<p>We expect this to be of greatest benefit to folks with 256 megs of RAM and a lot of hard drive space.  The more RAM your system has, the less benefit you should expect to see by using the texture cache.<p>* Patch Changes *<p>- Fixed a pathing problem in the waters of Acrylia Caverns<br>- More fixes for face and hair issues:  Most notably a bug with Erudite male hair color arrows changing the hair style instead of the color.<br>- Fixed a problem that was causing the % to crash some people when using in tells.<br>- Addressed several potential crash bugs.<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>Hooray! Another system tweak to hopefully increase your performance to the level that it was supposed to be when you opened the Shadows of Luclin box.<p>What the hell is the deal? A video game shouldn't require you to change your system.ini file to be able to play it. I get messages from people all the time who upgraded their systems specifically for Luclin, and still have crappy performance. As a friend of mine asked me today: &quot;What did I buy a new video card for?&quot; I see her point.<p>I have a 1 gHz processor, 512 megs of RAM, a 7200 RPM hard drive, and a GeForce 3 with 64 megs. This isn't a top-of-the-line system, but it far exceeds Luclin's requirements. Yet even after all the tweaks, my performance is marginal at best.<p>This is utterly ridiculous. I appreciate the fact that Verant is working to fix things, but that's like someone selling you a boat and apologizing later for all the gaping holes in the hull.<p>Luclin isn't an expansion. It's a huge, gaping breach that is rapidly sinking our jolly little ship.<p>Fix it. Fix it, fix it, fix it.<p><BIG>I Don't Mind the Grey Skies</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000427.html">stopped by</a> that thread on Dev Corner in which Abashi discussed changes made to the Grey.<p>Verant must be hearing lots of complaints, because Absor took the time to explain exactly what was done to the zone. First, he discussed what necessitated the changes:<p><B>Until the changes, it was possible to use an AoE group to pull and kill an extreme number of NPCs (upwards of 50+) in an almost continuous fashion with a lower level of risk than was appropriate. There were, essentially, three factors that contributed to this, factors that don't exist all together in any other zone. The addition of the light blue experience-giving NPCs made more low-hit point NPCs available to give experience. The Grey had a rather fast spawn rate, increasing the pool of available experience giving NPCs over time. Also the NPCs in that zone were given very low resistances in order to make casters more appealing to groups in the zone.<p>Looked at individually, these three factors all seem like good things. During testing this zone worked as intended. But when exposed to AoE groups, these factors created a situation that made such groups far too efficient in this zone.</B><p>Next, he went into great detail about what was done to re-tune the zone:<p><B>Increased the hit points of all NPCs in the zone 8% (yes, that's 8 more hit points for every 100 it had before).<p>Reduced the spawn rates on the NPCs in the zone. There are still plenty of NPCs in the zone, but it might not be possible to pull and kill 30 or 40 at a time at a fast rate anymore.<p>Increased the resistance of the NPCs to moderate levels. Where they were practically unable to resist spells before, they now can resist spells some of the time. Cold and Fire spells might get complete or partial resists half the time, doing full damage the rest of the time. The initial changes to the zone had the average monsters being quite resistant to magic based spells, and after looking at the results the magic resistance has been lowered to a more appropriate level. This change should allow people to snare and root mobs more easily in The Grey.<p>Additionally, a resistant monster was added to The Grey. The new Shimmering Rockfiend is highly resistant to fire and cold based spells, and adds a bit more danger to pure AoE groups. This is tempered by the fact that the Rockfiend is fairly rare, easy to see, and the soloing casters in the zone will learn to recognize his threat and avoid fighting him. If you are pulling 40 monsters to your AoE group though, chances are you'll pick up a Shimmering Rockfiend or two and have to deal with them.<p>This in no way makes casters completely broken in The Grey. It doesn't remove the ability to effectively run an AoE group in this zone either. What it does is reduce the effectiveness of pulling massive numbers of NPCs and wiping them out with an AoE group. And the zone is still very workable for the balanced experience group, as well as soloing casters.</B><p>Sounds pretty reasonable to me. But right now, <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=9922.topic">legions</a> of people who have never even set foot in the zone are flooding Verant with more e-mail about how unfair all of this is. And you wonder why Abashi gets <a href="http://www.urban75.org/useless/reflex.html">cranky</a>...<p><BIG>Hi, My Name is a_n00b_001</BIG><p>Alan had to take time out of his busy day once again to address one of those issues that makes you slap your forehead and want to shake someone. See, I'm convinced there is this clan of people called Patchwatchers. After every server downtime, these folks log in and check out every single item in their inventory, then try out all their class-specific skills, hoping they will find something has changed so that they can be the first to post about it.<p>What invariably ends up happening is someone fails feign death too many times, or doesn't see a fungus tunic drop after a few hours, or doesn't seem to be evading right, or has 18 fizzles in a row, and this person cries &quot;NERF! They nerfed XXXX in the last patch!&quot;<p>Sure enough, an itchy Patchwatcher sent Alan an e-mail complaining that some containers had been made no-drop in the last patch. Not all bags of a given type, mind you--just some of them. It's an evil Verant conspiracy, right? Right?<p><B>Those bags are no-drop only because they contain items that are no-drop. If you take the no-drop items out of the bags, you will see them return to droppable status.<p>Alan</B><p>Thanks, Patchwater. Please drive through.<p>NEXT!<p><BIG>Waitaminute, Maybe Patchwatcher Has a Point...</BIG><p>Erm, well, okay, maybe sometimes patchwatching is a good hobby after all.<p>We don't usually post stories about items here at Mobhunter; we prefer to leave that to the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/index.shtml">pros</a>. But in this case, the item change is kind of newsworthy--or at least interesting.<p>The aforementioned fungus covered scale tunic is almost always the subject of post-patch conjecture. But this time there may actually be evidence that drop rates have indeed been nerfed on this favorite item of twinkers and monks (not to mention monk twinkers) everywhere.<p>See, a new tunic was recently found called the <a href="http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/new/equipment/lazy/funguspatchvest.shtml">fungus patch vest</a>, and guess what--it has the <I>exact</I> same stats and effect as the fungus tunic. But unlike its predecessor, the fungus vest is usable by the Vah'Shir, is not usable by monks and druids, and most significantly, it is <B>no-drop.</B> In other words, you can still twink your kitty, but getting that regen item is going to be a lot trickier.<p>Even if drop rates on the fungus tunic are lower now, I'm not sure it matters. On any remotely mature server the fungus tunic is so prevalent that it's a rare zone you don't see one being auctioned in. And with all the old-school players needing 100k for their new horsies, a lot of fungus tunics are being unloaded for a song.<p>That's it from me for a few days (/em hears sounds of cheering in the background). Be nice while I'm gone, now!<br>
