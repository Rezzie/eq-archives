(original gamedesigner) Bill Trost. Currently the man in charge of EQ2, Trost was one of the creators of the original EverQuest, as well as the Kunark and Velious expansions. The interview details a bit of the game's history and the people behind it--although Brad McQuaid's name is conspicuous by its absence from the piece.<p>There weren't any huge revelations made about EQ2, but there are a couple quotes worthy of note:<p><B>We have big plans for E3 this year, where lots will be revealed.  It is very exciting...<p>Our core systems for EQ2 have been designed from the beginning to support expansions.  If EQ2 does well, I hope to be able to work on at least the first one of those, because we have some cool ideas that just don't fit with our initial release plans.</b><p>As I mentioned, SOE was very tight-lipped during my visit concerning anything related to EQ2, and we can see why--they want to save the fireworks for the E3 convention, which takes place this May in Los Angeles. If anyone out there wants to front me a plane ticket to L.A., I will be more than happy to cover this event for Mobhunter.<p>Overall the interview is pretty good, but it is kind of odd that one SOE employee (Mennix) would interview another. Oh well, good publicity, I guess. Maybe I will have Csenicier or Kohath interview me for Mobhunter. Or maybe I'll do my own interview--after all, it's obvious that I love listening to myself talk.<p><BIG>Pathing My Way Back to You, Babe</big><p>In an unexpected Test server patch message, it turns out the Dev Team has been working on upgrading mob pathing en masse:<p><B>Today we have introduced the first stage of an ongoing project to upgrade the pathing system for EverQuest. <p>Of course this means we would like you to keep your eyes open for NPCs doing bad things. NPCs will (should) move a bit differently, that is to be expected. If, for example, you are used to a specific NPC taking a round-about route to get from one place to another and he now takes a more direct route - that's a good thing. </b><p>Anyone who has ever pulled a mob more than ten feet in EQ--and in some cases, much less than that--knows what a thorn in the side bad pathing can be. There's nothing like aggroing a mob and watching it bolt off in exactly the opposite direction you intend it to go, especially when it brings back a bunch of angry friends with it.<p>It always seemed that bad pathing was a zone-specific issue, since many places have pathing that's just fine. If, however, the team has found a way to improve the pathing methodology itself, then more power to them. An across-the-board upgrade would be more than welcome, particularly for those of us who frequently act as puller for our groups and raids.<p>Those sneaky SOE folks didn't breathe a word of this change during my visit, which makes me wonder what else is up their collective sleeve. Fess up, you bastards! I know where you live--or work, at least.<p><BIG>The Beta Mac Show</big><p>Just when you thought SOE had forgotten about that whole EQ-on-the-Mac idea, <a href="http://eqmac.station.sony.com/registration/index.jsp">applications are being accepted</a> for the beta.<p>Since the ability to port the game onto the OS X platform was made possible by a DirectX emulation thingy (or something like that), I wouldn't expect the game itself to look much different. I will be interested to see how performance is on the Mac's hardware, though.<p>The few demos I've seen of OS X look cool enough, and there will always be folks who swear that the Mac is superior to the PC. Personally, the Macs that I've worked on have proven to be far less stable than my home machine running Windows XP. So until I see proof otherwise, I will stick to the opinion that Macs suck.<p>As if I don't get flamed enough for voicing my EverQuest opinions, now I'll get flamed by Mac fanatics. Lucky for me I haven't taken any shots at the Amiga for while, or else the freaks would really be out in force. Atari forever!<p>Anyway, as far as I know the plan is still to have Mac users on separate servers from the PC crowd, for technical reasons I guess. If this whole Mac experiment proves successful, who knows what <a href="http://dunkels.com/adam/contiki/">other platforms</a> EQ could end up on.<p><BIG>More Milk from the Money Machine</big><p>All the recent whispers about a new server coming online were proven true last week when the Maelin Starpyre server was announced. Not a split server and not really a virgin either, any player can <a href="https://store.station.sony.com/eq_item_moves/index.jsp">transfer their characters</a> to these new digs--for a fee.<p>At the low, low price of a mere $75, you can move one or two characters to the new server. The plus side is that you get to keep all your gear, unlike the typical non-Stormhammer transfer. The downside to this kind of move is that you don't know what the server atmosphere will be like once you get there. Your guild's attempt to escape competition might backfire, and you could suddenly find yourself in an even more hostile environment.<p>Speaking of Stormhammer, the announcement of Maelin Starpyre isn't sitting too well with some of the premium server's inhabitants, a few of whom have been expressing <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-1859855313">more and more discontent</a> lately. I have no idea what the server's population is these days, but it's a safe bet that the whole Legends experiment isn't the runaway success some in SOE probably hoped. In the meantime, Stormhammer patrons continue to shell out the higher fees, so some must still find it worthwhile. (Insert eBay farming joke here.)<p><BIG>Return of the Unwashed</big><p>Shamans around Norrath had been lamenting the unavailability of the Shaman's Crucible board, but as of today it seems to be <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=712e5bccaa128bebe01d6e46c8f8b00d&amp;threadid=11562">functioning again</a>. Time to get your post count back up by complaining about how you don't have Malo or Torpor yet.<p><BIG>The Video Card You Want</big><p>The reigning king of high-speed video cards right now is, of course, ATI's Radeon 9700 Pro. While many nVidia fans had been hopeful that the GeForce FX would take the lead as the chief speed demon, it turns out that under most circumstances the 9700 Pro outperforms its newer nemesis.<p>Upgrade junkies need not despair, however. The 9700 Pro will soon be outdone by another card after all--ATI's own <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1794">9800 Pro</a>.<p>Yes, Virginia, here is the $400 video card you'll want the Easter Bunny to bring you this spring. It rather significantly outperforms the 9700 Pro for the same amount of cash--though you can already see price tags on the older card being lowered in preparation for the new master's arrival.<p>How much will this card impact your EQ experience? Given the inefficiency of the game's engine and the fact that it isn't a DX9 (or even true DX8) design, it's really only the card's raw power that will provide much benefit. Anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering work <I>much</i> faster on the new card, and these two features (which smooth jagged lines and provide greater texture detail at a distance, respectively) make a massive difference on the visual quality of your EverQuest experience.<p>If you own a fast CPU with an 8x AGP motherboard and don't have a 9700 Pro already, the upgrade may well be worth it for you. Those with a slower CPU (1.5gHz or less) or those who currently own a 9700 Pro would probably see minimal improvements from moving to the new card under EQ. On the other hand, if you play true DX8 or DX9 games then you'd probably see a much bigger difference.<p>Personally, I just went from a 1.0 gHz Athlon to a 2.53 gHz P4 while keeping the same GeForce Ti4400 video card, and I can see a huge improvement in performance. This supports my supposition that the processor plays a bigger role than the video card when it comes to EQ, though I'll hopefully be able to pick up a 9800 Pro in the future to test my theory further. Since Kohath and Csenicier both picked up 9700 Pro cards recently, I'd love to get the faster version to rub in their faces.<p>In the meantime, of course, if anyone wants to send me one of the new cards, I'll happily run EQ benchmarks for everyone to determine if the card is really worth it. ATI, are you listening?<p>Wow, that's two free things I asked for in a single roundup. Oh well, if you don't put your name in for the phat lewts then you don't get them. That was the first thing I learned at the orc camps at level 5.<p>The second thing I learned, by the way, still holds true today: when the first thing doesn't work, ninjaloot.
