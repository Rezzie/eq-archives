This is partly due to the fact that bard news usually consists of &quot;this song is broken,&quot; followed by &quot;your song is fixed now,&quot; followed by &quot;no, it's still broken&quot; <I>ad infinitum.</I> The other reason is, well, we just don't know what the hell a bard does, other than put blinky things on our screens. There's something about carpal tunnel syndrome from hitting lots of keys, but other than that, the life of a bard is a mystery.<p>A recent patch change seems to have made bards <a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm1.showMessage?topicID=3336.topic">happy</a>, though. Something about pulsing songs and charm and... well, you sort it out. All we know about bards is that, aside from the blinky things, we've seen some well-played ones do amazing stuff. Oh, and that EQ Diva lady is nice (met her at FanFaire once, when Mobhunter was but a twinkle in our eyes). So, consider this little newsbite our shout-out to underappreciated bards everywhere.<p><BIG>Necro 101</BIG><p>Have you always had a preoccupation with the <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/709182.asp?cp1=1">dead</a>? Would you enjoy life as a skeleton or spectre? Then perhaps the job of necromancer is for you. Okay, you ask, but how do I get started?<p>Luckily, a <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/007057.html">how-to guide</a> was posted a while back to explain the benefits of this oft-maligned class. Yes, it's an old post that someone resurrected (an apt phrase), but it bears reading nonetheless. As I've said before, necros in an exp group can be phenomenal.<p>&quot;Hey, WTF is Moorgard being so nice to bards and necros for? Does he want a job with them or something? Stupid VAK site!&quot;<p>In other necro news, Verant's own Scott Hartsman (you know, that technical guy) <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=311">stopped by</a> their board (and other class boards, it seems) to discuss certain issues, and ended up posting some interesting findings on a spell distribution model he created:<p><B>Long story short, over a period of 2000-and-some seb repops, I measured that some classes' spells do, in fact, drop less often than others, exactly as many people suspect. (however, not as severe as some people think).</B><p>All those shamans who scoffed at the notion of truly random drops can thank the necros for vindication.<p><BIG>You Ain't Just Whistling Fisty</BIG><p>The much ballyhooed (well, discussed at least) Whistling Fists quest has been <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=22278.topic">solved</a>, resulting in a pretty darn nice (think epic-level nice, not Velious uber) weapon.<p>What's the deal with this? Well, The Whistling Fists thing was a long-standing Iksar monk quest that had gone unfinished since Kunark's release. The quest talked about a weapon of great power, but since it wasn't in game, no one knew what it would be. The Iksar monks had their shackle quests anyway, and could get their epic easily enough by killing the quest givers and obtaining the Robe of the Lost Circle (the hardest part of the monk epic quest).<p>Now that Verant has placed the quest for the Whistling Fists in the game (the quest itself has a great story that explains how Iksar monks came to be, btw), a bit of controversy is brewing. While Iksar monks were always able to do the human sash &amp; headband quests, humans could never do the Iksar shackle quests--until a recent patch. Now that humans can gain faction and actually wear the shackles, it seemed fitting that they would be able to complete the Whistling Fists quest. This doesn't seem likely, however, as the end of the quest requires interaction with Cazic-Thule himself, which is out of the question for a human monk.<p>The other issue is that--assuming the Whistling Fists weapon is supposed to be the Iksar equivalent of the Robe of the Whistling Fists that is required for the monk epic (still with me? lots of whistling going on, I know), then why are the weapon's stats so much better than those of the robe? Granted, the weapon quest seems much longer and more difficult, but honestly the stat difference is huge. And the question remains: does this mean the robes will no longer drop from the human quest givers (long considered by many monks to be an exploit of the epic quest)?<p>The end result of all this is that some monks are happy, some are furious, and lots of arguing is bound to happen. Hey, it's monks we're talking about. My solution: get your epic, but skip the Whistling Fists if you can and wait for a nice Luclin weapon with the same or better ratio plus a proc. And in the meantime, there are plenty of other weapons with excellent ratios that will tide you over until you move on to bigger game.<p>Wow, that's three classes I've been mostly nice to today. I better talk about something else...<p><BIG>The Old Mudball Upgrades His Temple</BIG><p>Ah, remember the days when The Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule (CT for short) was packed to the gills with level 30ish players killing lizards and getting phat lewt? Zone in now and you'll find those days are gone like a suit of Rubicite. Aside from the occasional powerleveler or Ravenscale farmer, the temple of the Faceless is abandoned--one might say it got lost a second time.<p>Over on Test server, however, CT has found <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9920.topic">new life</a> in the form of an upgraded 50+ raid zone. Named lizardmen and blue-to-60 mobs abound, giving high-level players another outlet for gaining those AAXP skills.<p>The downside? If you stocked up on CT gate potions or are a wizard who likes to hang out in south Antonica, you're out of luck. Otherwise, most players will be excited about this change, especially old-schoolers who used to fight there in the old days. I bet a huge portion of the player base has never spent more than a few minutes in this zone--in which case, you're in for a treat. Makes you wonder what they're going to do to the Avatar of Fear.<p>A sleepy Tuesday turned out to be somewhat interesting news-wise, Lucky for you guys, rainy days don't get the Mobhunter newshouds down.
