Check out the complete text of <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/future_plans.jsp">Smed's announcement</a> for all the details. We'll just post some highlights here.<p>One of the popular notions going around the message boards these days from disgruntled players (and former players who just can't walk away) is that EQ is dying, or that SOE just wants to push subscribers to EQ2. Smed has the following response:<p><B>We are going to continue to support EverQuest. As a matter of fact, we have two new expansions in the works. The first one's coming this Fall, and its focus is on dungeons! Many members of the EQ team are already hard at work on it. We've increased the size of the EverQuest team to add more amazing things to the game, to further expand places you've explored before and to continue to update the game on a constant basis. Our goal is to make sure EverQuest remains a dynamic game that continues to grow for years to come. We recognize that you've spent a lot of time in EQ over the years--so have we. Making this world exciting for you is our passion.</B><p>A new expansion in the fall sounds about right--this is probably the Lost Dungeons of Norrath title that was kicked around a while back. It's also worth noting yet again that SOE isn't stripping the EQ team down (though the thought of Scott Hartsman in a thong is positively yummy) and shifting resources over to the EQ2 side. They're two separate teams, just like the EQOA and PlanetSide devs are distinct from one another.<p>So how can you choose between EQ, PlanetSide, EQ2, and EQOA? Well, the good news is you don't have to:<p><B>We realize that many of you will want to play both EQ and EQII, so we're introducing the SOE All Access(TM) subscription. It allows you to play a large mix of our most popular offerings for only $21.99 per month. Our Legends customers will receive this same access to our games at no additional charge. This makes it affordable and easy to play SOE's games, including: <p>*	EverQuest&reg; (both PC and Mac version when it's released) <br>*	EverQuest II&reg; (when released) <br>*	EverQuest&reg; Online Adventures(TM) <br>*	PlanetSide(TM) <br>*	Station Pass(TM) Games (Infantry(TM), Cosmic Rift(TM), Tanarus&reg;) <p>Please note that Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided(TM) will not be a part of this package, nor will partner published games be included. You will also need to buy the retail version of any game you don't already own.</B><p>Again, this is something many players have been anticipating. In fact, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,58749,00.html">a recent <I>Wired</I> article</a> talks about how package subscription deals like this could be a good way to attract a wider audience to online gaming. After all, consumers are used to paying for cable and satellite packages on a monthly basis, so the ability to play an entire suite of games may indeed appeal to our variety-hungry culture.<p>Really, $22 a month is a bargain for all those titles. In fact, adding access to the other games with a Legends subscription could well make playing on the Stormhammer server a bit more attractive to some customers.<p>Many players have been debating the future of EverQuest in the face of competition, both from without and within. Early buzz on <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a> is certainly promising, and I'll be excited to see that game in action.<p>But personally, I can't freaking wait for EQ2. If you haven't seen the <a href="http://everquest2.station.sony.com/">revamped Web site</a>, go have a peek at the handiwork of Mr. Pearce's team. Those new <a href="http://everquest2.station.sony.com/media.jsp">screenshots</a> make me weep and tremble with excitement. I just can't wait to play around in a world that looks like that. Ultimately, of course, it's content that keeps players coming back, and this will be the true test for whatever game wants to become the yardstick by which other titles are measured. And if it's EQ2, Warcraft, Sigil, or somebody else who comes up with the most compelling game, that's where the audience will go. In fact, ideally the audience will keep expanding and will be drawn to a variety of places, all offering something unique and fun.<p>But as for good old EQ, there's no cause for worry. Yeah yeah, the game is dying. But it sure looks like we're going to have a lot of fun dancing on its grave for a long time to come.
