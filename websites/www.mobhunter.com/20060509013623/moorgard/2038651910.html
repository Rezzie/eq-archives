Take a gander:<p><B>December 19, 2002  3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>** Zones **<p>- Spectral Parchments, Ethereal Parchments, and Glyphed Rune word drops have been increased significantly in the third tier Planes of Power zones.<br>- The trials within the Halls of Honor have been changed slightly.  Please proceed with caution.<br>- Several Planes of Power NPCs are no longer angered quite as badly when they notice a healing spell being cast on a player they are angry with.<br>- Made improvements to the Planes of Power quest armors.<br>- Assorted quest, item, and dialogue fixes.<p>** Planes of Power Zone Progression **<p>As most know, progressing through Planes of Power zones requires that certain tasks be performed.  In many cases, one of the tasks required involves being on a raid that defeats a particularly powerful foe.<p>One side effect of this progress is that if the tasks were not accomplished in a particular order, a person on a raid may not gain the flag for completing the event, as they did not complete the prerequisite tasks.<p>The majority of &quot;zone boss&quot; style encounters in the first three tiers of Planes of Power zones have been changed to allieviate this problem of completing tasks out of order.<p>As of today, if you defeat one of these foes and do not have all of the prerequisites completed to receive the flag at the end of the event, you will be able to go back and complete the tasks that you have not yet performed.  <p>Once you've done that, you may speak with the Seer in the Plane of Knowledge who will make sure that you are then able to progress as if you had performed the tasks in their proper order.</B><p>And casters everywhere squealed with delight at news that their spells are easier to get. Seriously, drops have been pretty sparse in PoP, so this should make folks happy. Except, of course, for those casters who can't get into third-tier zones--or at least think they can't. There is even some confusion over what third tier zones are, though most at least agree on Bastion of Thunder, Halls of Honor, and the Tower of Sol Ro. BoT and HoH have key quests you can do to gain access if your guild isn't up to taking out boss mobs to get flags.<p>Upgrades to PoP quest armors are nice, even though most of them were pretty spiffy anyway. Some pieces had <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=72bf0a044b58a5cbc701bec51b13528e&amp;threadid=4550">handy effects</a> added to them, and some received other changes as well. Nobody will complain about getting something enhanced, will they? Silly reader, you should know by now that <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=2b074242196199f0198d20e465ca5a16&amp;threadid=9064">somebody</a> will find a way to be unhappy.<p>The elimination of the necessity to get planar access flags in a particular order is a big relief. It was rather silly that you could kill a boss mob and not get flagged for the next zone simply because you didn't hail some random NPC in Tranquility first.<p>As ever, post other changes you find below, or <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">drop me a line</a> and let me know what secrets you discover.<p><BIG>Mischief Makes a Move</BIG><p>The Plane of Mischief has a cult following. For whatever reason, some people just get obsessed with this zone, in spite of (or perhaps because of) the fact that it has never worked quite right. It was tuned and retuned at various times until it pretty much became useless. And, given the fact that the entrance is deep in the bowels of the Temple of Veeshan's north wing, it isn't exactly a high-traffic zone.<p>A revamp has been promised for a while now, and as a reader named Onetree has pointed out to us, <a href="http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheplaneofmischieffrm12.showMessage?topicID=477.topic">evidence suggests</a> it will be soon. Some spell effects have gone live that pretty much <I>have</I> to be associated with PoM--unless Verant plans on adding a masochistic chessboard to some other zone.<p>Will the Mischief revamp be everything fans have been waiting for? Who knows. A better question is how accessible the place will be. After all, the Plane of Tranquility has spoiled us a bit in terms of making planar access easy. At any rate, if new nastiness is to be added to the revamped zone--which will debut first for Legends subscribers, of course--hopefully they let people change their bind points. Though, come to think about it, I'm sure Bristlebane would find death loops to be a lot funnier than players do.<p><BIG>Miss Manners</BIG><p>Scott Hartsman recently answered some questions for the folks at <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/">Monkly Business</a>--you know, the site owned by that player auction guy. He talked mostly about the state of the monk mitigation changes:<p><B>We're not completely satisfied with it as a permanent solution, true, but it's not horribly broken at the moment, either. Monks as a whole are still extremely playable. <p>The main problem that we have at the moment is ambiguity inherent in parsing them. Due to their primary defense being avoidance, monks are the streakiest of all classes when it comes to defense. <p>One battle, they may take no damage at all. The next, against an identical opponent, they may end up losing 60% of their health. <p>Taken over a good number of battles, monks actually still do come out very, very well, regardless of their equipment, which is why this isn't a &quot;burning priority&quot; issue. The current problem was slightly overstated from a given subset of bad streaks. <p>The obvious, simple, answer would be to reduce the streakiness and then retune from there. However, the fact that monk defense is supposed to be avoidance-based is a central part of their class, and changing that just to make the numbers come out better would be fixing a subtle problem by redefining a class with a sledgehammer, which isn't a particularly good solution to any problem.</B><p>Monks, of course, generally <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=35369.topic">don't like this answer</a> and want a more definite solution. In hopes of resolving monk complaints, I am posting a bit of code below that Hartsman's team can add--free of charge, mind you--to the EQ code base:<p>100 if monk=uber then mitigation=mitigation-100; print &quot;yer gear is too good, so die!&quot;<br>110 if monk=nonuber then print &quot;good, monk, know your place in the universe&quot;<br>120 if monk=noob then mitigation=mitigation+100; print &quot;stick to the mesh armor and be happy!&quot;<p>This should make life tougher on evil uber monks but easier on the poor newbies who saw their lives ruined by the cataclysmic changes. Deathfist pawns are trembling even now. I knew I should have been a programmer!<p>Hartsman also hints at new scripting being added to some PoP events to prevent intentionally blown spawns. Not that this <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/">ever actually happens</a>, of course. It's all sunshine and flowers when it comes to mob spawns, remember?
