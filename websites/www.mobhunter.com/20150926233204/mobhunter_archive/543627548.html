Big patch leads to problems, which lead to a followup patch. As if you weren't expecting it:<p><B>On Thursday, October 17th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a brief update. The estimated downtime is 2 hours. The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>So what were the problems that lead to this being necessary? Well...<p>As the patch message mentioned, some encounters were tuned to take into account the change to mod rods. Well, many found certain mobs <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3289">too easy</a> after the patch, and based upon the following broadcast this evening, Verant seemed to agree:<p><B><SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE>: Fensor : Greetings!  We regret to inform you that Emperor Ssraeshza and Vyzh`dra the Cursed will be unavailable this evening. Please look forward to entertaining either (or both) of these fellows in the days to come.  Thank you for your understanding!</B><p>Of course the message came too late on some servers to prevent gimpy kills, but hopefully not too many guilds got easy access into Vex Thal as a result of this patch.<p>Speaking of mod rods, if you hung around in the Bazaar or Nexus for more than a couple minutes tonight you were sure to find a rod suddenly appear on your cursor. Yes, folks, we've entered the age of <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=29123.topic">mod-rod spamming</a>. Players anticipated this exact issue as soon as the upcoming change was announced, so it's too bad Verant didn't take steps to prevent it. Hopefully the followup patch will make rods unsummonable in certain zones. Either that, or change the name of the thing to Rod of Mystical Annoyance.<p>Right after the patch, the vendor who was supposed to be selling the targetable rod summons spell wasn't supplying it, but that was <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=7241.topic">soon fixed</a> manually on each server. Mages also noted that the old mod rod 1 spell now <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=7232.topic">shares the same timer</a> as rod 2, and it's unknown if this is intentional or a bug. Rod 1 wasn't real efficient as a means of gaining mana anyway.<p>Some wizards were pleased to find their <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm51.showMessage?topicID=137.topic">manaburn teams strong as ever</a> after the patch. Well, maybe Gorenaire won't be going down like she used to, but other Kunark dragons won't be a problem. Further testing of the new manaburn was continuing, with at least <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=21811.topic">some crits</a> showing up.<p>Monks continue to be flustered by the change to their defensive abilities. Parsing is still in progress, and reports of all kinds are flooding in. Though the patch message stated that mitigation had been changed, some parsing showed that it was actually avoidance that may have been nerfed. But the Plane of Mischief's recluse monk, Irontaail of Triton, may have the most <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessage?topicID=315.topic">interesting summary</a> so far:<p><B>Mid-lvl and high lvl NON-uber guild monks are reporting they can no longer solo, inc most light blues ... sort of crippling the mid-lvl monks ... but here's the bad thing imho:<p>1 - lvl 60 monk fighting next to me from non-uber guild 100+aa, had to FD off pulling 1 shroom starting 100% health with single Aeg. He told me after he could normally solo 1 shroom np and ended up about 50% health. He was pissed and logged .. so no telling if this was just a bad run or not.<p>2 - I had group Aeg and my self buffs running ... solo'd 10 shrooms in a row, no down time, one after the other .. ended 100% health 8-( .. I went down to 94% health during my lowest fight. I was running 5700hp, 1466 ac during the fight test. It may be different in VT tonight<p>But if this is an indication of what happened ... it will truely suck for mid-lvl, and non-uber guild monks .. and have almost the opposite effect as was intended ... </B><p>Monks also <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=33200.topic">freaked out</a> over seeing their Block skill cap lowered from 230 to 225. The silly monks who panicked were soon made to realize that the skill had always capped at 225 and that several Web sites had simply listed the skill cap info incorrectly. Gosh, it's so unlike monks to spaz out like that.<p>Other players were worried by rumors of a <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=16873.topic">stealth nerf to your exp bar</a>. Seems some folks thought that level 60 was going to be made harder in this patch, such that it would take longer to fill the bar. People who had maxed out the level in hopes of dinging 61 as soon as PoP comes out cringed at the thought of logging in to find the bar half full or something. Such worries proved to be unfounded, however... at least for now.<p>Verant wasn't kidding in the patch message when they mentioned that merchants have begun to more highly value the Staff of Forbidden Rites. Some players had been using vendors to recharge this rez stick that drops off Lady Vox, but now vendors are reportedly <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=33223.topic">charging over 200K</a> to sell back the stick. That puts the cost of recharging a staff at nearly half a million plat. Ouch--but it's probably about time.<p>On the plus side of the coin, warriors were pleased to find the meatshield--er, I mean /shield--ability had <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=2238.topic">gone live</a>. This skill available to warriors level 30 and up allows the tank to target a nearby player and absorb 50% of the damage done to that player, though at a cost--the warrior actually takes 75% of the mob's damage output. Whether this skill was intended to go live or not is unknown. Interestingly, <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=21813.topic">NPCs also gained this ability</a> in some zones. Fair is fair, I guess. Though if you play it smart, you actually get some bonus damage to mobs if they use this skill. Silly mobs.<p>There were other little problems that turned up. Many people reported that their keyrings were broken, though mine didn't seem to have a problem. Shadow Haven got some <a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/funkysh.jpg">odd wallpaper</a>, and Twilight Sea also had majorly messed-up textures.<p>All in all, it's quite clear that a followup patch was necessary. It's scary for Verant to have to scramble and fix major stuff this close to PoP's release, though. I wouldn't be taking time off work on the release date in the hopes that you'll be able to play without interruption. It doesn't seem to work that way anymore... if it ever did.<p><BIG>Oh, I Wish It Would Rain Down</BIG><p>Verant has supplied us with yet another god of the day for you to identify. Can you possibly guess who it is?<p><TABLE border="0" cellpadding="2"><TR><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/god3a.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/god3as.jpg"></a></TD><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/god3b.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/god3bs.jpg"></a></TD><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/god3c.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/god3cs.jpg"></a></TD></TR></TABLE><p><I>&quot;I rule through wisdom and kindness and am revered by many.

Knowledge, Tranquility, Disease, and Nightmares all get profiled.<p>The Plane of Knowledge includes the city of New Tanaan, where the residents all have golden-brown skin. Why? Because the city has so many Tanaan beds.<p>[blank stares]<p>Umm, it's late and I'm sleepy, k?<p><BIG>Good Questions</BIG><p>The folks over at Electric Artists had some sort of Q &amp; A session with Verant and posted a rather <a href="http://www.electricartists.com/everquest/eq_QA.htm">interesting interview</a> on their rather ugly site (sorry, but something makes that font look ghastly on my computer). I don't know who these people are or who at SOE answered the questions, but it's a good read. Most of the questions are direct and practical, unlike the vague ones that a lot of magazines and Web sites tend to ask.<p>Okay, seriously, I gotta get some sleep. Tomorrow there will be another patch to decipher, and who knows... maybe I'll have to write another of these damned &quot;what went wrong&quot; summaries tomorrow night.<p>It ain't easy being me.
