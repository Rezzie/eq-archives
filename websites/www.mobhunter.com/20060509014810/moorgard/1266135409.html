By way of explanation...<p>Yesterday marked the first public patch of a massive set of changes that included a) making the existing EQ Live servers run a whole lot more efficiently, b) beginning to support EQ being localized to other languages, as well as c) some foundation work for Planes of Power.<p>We've completely reworked a number of data storage systems - Characters, Guilds, and pretty much everything having anything to do with NPCs and their loot.<p>As many of you have experienced, it's not necessarily the smoothest road, but it's gone a *lot* smoother than it might have.   Once we get these all cleaned up, quite a few things will just be working better in general.<p>One example being: Anyone who's ever disbanded and recreated a guild, attempted to have one renamed, or tried to create one that was too close in name to an existing guild, has seen the limitations in our old way of handling guilds.  Those limitations and their frequently occasionally annoying side effects should be gone now.<p>As a result of some of the changes to character inventory storage, a few people who logged in yesterday have had their items with procs break.<p>People with non-functioning epics, Orbs of Tishan, or other items with effects that broke as part of our changes - Please make sure to petition for a trade in.  Test is still a non-support server, and we can't promise a timely reimbursal, but losing some of these larger things is a bit much.  We'll get them fixed up where we can.<p>Thanks for your patience, and for helping to find quite a few important bugs.  (Sorry - We've already fixed the one that was causing some NPCs to always drop their rare loot.  On the bright side, others were always dropping their common - That's fixed now, too.)<p>- The EverQuest Development Team</B><p>Sounds like they've changed some of the database structures to run more efficiently. Here at Mobhunter, Csenicier is our database guru, and he's screwed stuff up more times than I can count, so I can assure you that the potential for big problems is very real. The patch message's assertion that &quot;it's gone a *lot* smoother than it might have&quot; is no understatement, even though it sounds like things on Test were in a pretty bad state.<p>I was hoping for the Test patch message to include word on the complete heal bug and other major problems, but nothing on that yet. Sorry, tanks, you'll just have to keep dying needlessly. On the plus side, slack clerics can continue to blame the bug for your deaths, so it all works out.<p><BIG>That Voodoo That You (Used to) Do</BIG><p>The old 3dfx Voodoo line of video cards is, of course, dead in the water, but the Voodoo 2-5 still ran EQ pretty well--good enough for a bot or backup machine, at least. That is, until Tuesday's patch. Since then, Voodoo 2 users have <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/026724.html">noticed</a> that their cards stopped working altogether.<p>Verant confirmed that the Voodoo 2 is, indeed, no longer supported in EverQuest, and it isn't on their <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/compatability_matrix.jsp">list of supported cards</a>. Owners of the cards are upset and seeking justice, of course, but I think they should just spend $50 and buy a cheap GeForce 2 and be done with it. You'll powerlevel your toons even more efficiently, I assure you.<p><BIG>Overreactors Anonymous</BIG><p>There was a bunch of hoopla on other sites about how a recommended level modifier was being added to many existing items (okay, Kohath even wrote about the possibility of such a change to the fungus tunic, but Kohath is a n00b). Fortunately, Scott Hartsman arrived to <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=15405.topic&amp;index=14">make clear</a> that you don't have to lose sleep over this scare:<p><B>&quot;Recommended Level&quot; items have worked this way since they were introduced to the public with the launch of Luclin, and in its Beta since longer than I've been here. :)<p>No stealth intention on anything here, folks. It's just another option for specific items, at a designer's discretion.<p>It's been talked about on quite a few sites already - <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornertailoring.showMessageRange?topicID=3934.topic&amp;start=21&amp;stop=40">Here's</a> one sample, about the 4th message down.<p>It's also not the sweeping change that some appear to be assuming. It's not going to be applied to &quot;Every item in the game!1!1!&quot; or anything insane like that. <p>If designers have an item that they don't want to make NODROP due to twinking potential, now they have an option.<p>That's really all that it's there for, and as you've seen, it's been used somewhat sparingly over the past six months.<p>I like to think that options, especially alternatives to the absolutes of NODROP/NOEQUIP, are a good thing. :)<p>Best,<p>- Scott Hartsman</B><p>Scott also responded to specific panic over the Thurgadin gate potion:<p><B>&gt; And what about Thurg gate potions, with a recommended <br>&gt; level of 60, but currently you can still use them at a lower <br>&gt; level? Are they going to make it so that you can't use them <br>&gt; pre-60? Or implement the new partial-benefit mode, so if <br>&gt; you're below 60, you only get part of the benefit <p>(laughs) I like it.<p>Partial gate -- You zone out......and you never zone back in.<p>Shouldn't have that flag on it, most likely. <p>The Recommended Level on that item, as you correctly surmised, does absolutely nothing. :)<p>- S.</B><p>See? Much ado about nothing. Rest assured, Kohath is being suitably punished for adding to the panic. He'll be using his own toothbrush to clean the Mobhunter toilets for the next month, and won't be allowed to go on any <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~b3ta/femaleorshemale/#">dates</a> during that time.<p>One of our readers, Ibsen on Saryrn, sent me a nice e-mail discussing the notion of placing level limits on items:<p><B>It seems to me that a while back Verant wanted very badly to implement the trivial loot code and put a dent in the twink market. Wisely, they polled the EQ community and no doubt saw there could be a great deal of backlash if people explored new areas and never saw loot drops because they we too high. VI is approaching this problem from a new angle now and I would be interested to see your views and the views of others.<p>Personally, I think this is a step in the right direction for a couple of reasons. First off, the desirability of items goes up simply because they can be traded and thus the price of the item goes up as well. The price of an item would go down when you eliminate a large portion of the population that can use that item... Changing items like this means less demand for the sale of premium items which leads to less farmers camping the mobs that drop those items. This allows people that want to experience the challenge of taking some of these mobs down to actually do so instead of spending their time in NFP waiting for the camper to sell the wares... No Drop items truely suck in this game and with the addition of level specific code then more items could be droppable in theory.</B><p>Good points, and I tend to agree. Putting a recommended level on items is much, much better than making things nodrop. In fact, I wouldn't be opposed to things like NToV loot being tradable as long as there's a level 59 or 60 limit placed on them. Verant wants a healthy economy in this game, and making the best items sellable while limiting their use to players who are of the appropriate level to earn them makes a lot of sense. The nodrop tag should be limited to quest items in all but a few cases.<p>Well, I think I've belittled the Mobhunter staff enough for on day. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go. Verant is flying me away for the weekend on the company jet to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-040802playola.story">reward me</a> for all the free press I give to their game. I just hope the escargot is fresh this time; stale snails really cut into my enjoyment of the Dom Perignon.
