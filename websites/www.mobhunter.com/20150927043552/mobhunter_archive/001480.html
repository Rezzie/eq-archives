<h1 class="article_title">A Moss Snake Kicks You for 4 ^H^H^H^H^H</h1>
<p>by Loral on June 13, 2006</p>

<p>Much of the Everquest community's attention still lies on the Progression Server, now named "The Combine". SOE currently plans to release this server at the end of June. A lot of players are returning to the long forgotten lands of Norrath to remember the first days adventurers walked the lands. Whether or not they stay is a question yet answered.</p>

<p>Today brings the release of the largest patch since the release of Prophecy of Ro. While it contained few of the much needed content changes to Prophecy of Ro, it did contain a plethora of feature fixes.</p>

<p>Two improvements in particular may seem mundane to experienced players but do much to make Everquest a more accessible game for new players.  Players can now see group members on the in-game map, helping them locate their fellows when they get lost. I can't even fathom the amount of time I would earn back if this feature had been implemented six years ago. The next feature is the inclusion of the Guild Lobby into the core game. The ability for players to summon their body regardless of whether they purchased Dragons of Norrath is a huge improvement for lower and mid-level players who have neither the tools nor the experience to find corpses lost in the less forgiving pits of the older worlds. </p>

<p>These two improvements help bring Everquest closer to the industry standards for massive online role playing games. While many may shout, stamp their feet, and wave their fists saying that it is just the further "dumbing down" of Everquest - we will see how long they play on the Combine server suffering through eight hour corpse runs in Fear or sixteen-zone runs to get back their bronze armor. Long behind me are the days of horrifying corpse recovery - recovery that directly adversely affected my real life - and good riddance.</p>

<p>This patch also included the implementation of a new chat service back-end. While advertised as "transparent to the user", the service did have a few bugs.  Using a semicolon to send a cross-server tell no longer works and chatting in channels from EQIM also no longer works. No doubt this change helped SOE consolidate resources, but it would have been nice to ensure a truly transparent shift before implementation.</p>

<p>SOE modified experience gain for evolving items, intelligent items, and shrouds. In all three cases, experience gain has improved and now follows the same modifiers that regular experience follows when grouping. As players join others in groups, each player earns a higher percentage of experience than they would alone. Now experience earned by items and when transformed through shrouds includes the same bonuses.</p>

<p>Along with this change, SOE increased the amount of required experience for the single most popular evolving item, the cloak of the spirit tracker. This increase in total experience gain means that players who may have been 40% into the item's progression are now down to 10%. This change may be off-set by the overall increase in item experience, but again, only time will tell if the balance was met.</p>

<p>Today, SOE released one of the long awaited changes to the Everquest death system. Along with the full release of the guild lobby to all players, players will now begin losing experience and leaving equipped corpses starting at level 6. A corpse summoner in the tutorial will teach players how to recover their body using the summoners. While this doesn't meet the ideal circumstance of returning to a bind point fully equipped on death, it does help show players how to handle the death system in Everquest when they might be used to the systems in newer games.</p>

<p>This patch also released a new and much improved Nektulos forest. The previous version of Nektulos, released with the release of Depths of Darkhollow, often received complaints that it broke the realism of a forest. Instead of individual trees, that version had large single-sided objects painted with the texture of trees. This gave it the feel of a movie-set instead of a forest. The new Nektulos matches much of the layout of the original Nektulos but with a much improved look.</p>

<p>In the greatest retroactive nerf to the original Everquest legacy, no longer will moss-snakes kick. All animals not able to actually kick can no longer do so. While this change makes sense, it seems to be an extreme change to a piece of long lasting Everquest mythology. The elusive kicking moss snake will be forever missed.</p>

<p>Times are quiet in the lands of Norrath. The high-end raiders seek the beasts at the end of Deathknell and the treasures they hold. Others look to the history captured in the Combine. For those of us in between, we stare across the voids left in Ro's Prophecy and think to the days of adventure long past and far into the future.</p>

<p>I think the combine server will tear another rift in eq. after the hype is worn off and people see it is still just the same old game its "goose will be cooked". and then when the level is raised and the gap between casual and "uber" widens yet again in the super-ultimate-bestest gear yet feast another blow will be delt. the folks i know that still play eq do not want levels raised and do not even want another expansion released anytime soon for that matter.</p>

<p>I am truely disappointed that SOE spent resources on the combine server.  They claimed only a dev or two was working on the server.  Well I call bullshit on that.  Since the day combine Beta came up there have been 0 Developers and only maybe 1-2 QA on Test Server.  All this during the DX9.0c shift.  We had dozens and dozens of bugs that occured and were reported but went ignored and infixed due to the mass shift of resources from Test to Combine.  Many of these bugs have now patched to lives. </p>

<p>Combine will go down in EQ history as the biggest flop in this game, mark my words.  The manpower and resources wasted on this server are huge.  One or two Devs my ass.  This server will be a ghost town before POP is even unlocked.</p>

<p>I came back for the Progression Server. For me it's not even really about the good old days per se.  I stopped playing after 6 years just after DoDh came out. After Anguish, I was all raided out and it just looked to get worse.  </p>

<p>Combine will give me a chance to start over, play through the expansions at an accelerated pace and yet not fall too far behind due do various time sinks in the game. By Velious, I'm looking forward to NToV and Luclin boss raids. Then good ole PoP. After that we'll see how things are but it should be a good time.</p>

<p>I logged in my old character and I run from empty zone to empty zone.  I can't find more than a dozen people in any zone, that's less than two groups. Trying to play a new character is all but impossible. Combine will packed for some time due to the limited hunting grounds and popularity.</p>

<p>In short, Combine is the greatest thing SOE has ever done and it will bring in a new era of EQ. </p>

<p>I also think it's foolish to blame this server for all the patch blunders. Frankly, SOE has *never* done a patch successfully and one this size just begs for 2-3 more follow patches. They. do. not. test. Never have, never will.  That's what paying customers are for. Don't blame Combine devs on their lack of QA.</p>

<p>Progression is abit like the romance of steam trains. I can leave the third class compartment of the diesel power super train which is heading for the broken bridge to buy a ticket for a slow initially one class steam excursion. However its a fixed track to the same final destination and nothing will avoid the inevitable train wreck at the end. My dilemma is will the view along the way be worth the journey. </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Wonglow on June 15, 2006 06:27 AM</strong></p>
<p>First of all ,   in response to CONCERNED1 's post  saying the people he knows who still play EQ  don't want  more lvls and new expansions .............the people you know that play EQ must not play much or are likely in nowhere social guilds.</p>

<p>because ALOT of the EQ players on my server  are bored out of their minds when raids aren't happening due to maxing out PoR single group content within 2 weeks of starting on it ( thats not really hardcore pace either , it just went that fast)</p>

<p>many of us ( myself included)  maxed omens aa's before  Dragons of Norrath came out ( which had no aa's)  we waited for DoD  and sadly only had 200 or so worthwhile spendable aa's in that expansion which took a very short amount of time so we  again are waiting for MORE AA's</p>

<p>basically  most of us DO want more lvls ,  more specfically ALOT of us  DO want more aa's.</p>

<p>gab between casual and uber should be wide. There is no reason a person that plays for 5 hours a week should have comparable stats to a person that plays 5 hours a day.</p>

<p>you get out what you put in ,  no one is special ,  people aren't created Equal in real life nor  in Virtual life.</p>

<p>Progression server isn't the answer to EQ's problems</p>

<p>Answer is simple ,  Advertise the next expansion in comercials.</p>

<p>EQ has been around for like 7 years now ,  its not even remotely close to being dead ,  large amounts of WoW players  got maxed out too fast  with low depth and returned , ditto for many EQ2 players</p>

<p>basically EQ2 was a waste of time ,  u should not make a sequel to a game  you can't beat <br />
( even with max AA still always raid upgrades)<br />
They should have revamped the 3d engine  after Omens came out.</p>

<p>Eq1 with comparable graphics = WoW's coffin nail </p>

<p>vanguard? please  ,   Verant did it right the first time , they are gonna run into the same problem as EQ2</p>

<p>why  would a massive player base move to another RPG to start from 0 after putting 2-7 years into a charactor that isn't all it can be nor having seen everything the game has to offer.</p>

<p>I really hope SoE pulls its head out of its a$$ and upgrades  Eq1 graphics on a widescale  ,  advertise the next two big expansions and just destroy the competition</p>

<p>as that would be  the result in  advertiseing next couple expansions + complete  graphic overhaul.</p>

<p>wonglow: do you even grasp how absurd it is to compare wow to eq anymore? the most active subscriber numbers eq ever had for any length of time was at around 560k. wow has held MILLIONS. i mean do you understand that ? and the more "uber" eq has got; the more its base line subscription numbers have fell off. i understand alot of people are are in denial and wont accept the facts but jesus man look at those figures. in the wildest dreams of the eq devs they never hope to dream to have 5 million subscribers. i predict the raise in levels/aa/gear plus the failure of the progression server will eventually cause another exodus of eq subscribers. and when wow gets that new expansion....oh mamma look out. also no matter who is running vanguard when it comes out it will take some eq subscribers. if it just takes ten eq subscribers its still took subscribers from eq.</p>

-----</p>

<p>he is also missing the fact that a EQ with new graphics slapped on will not do as much to draw the casual/solo players as wow did. alot of the people who went to wow went there because they knew they could put in the time and get gear as good as a raider in most cases and the only thing seperating them from having all the gear the raider had would be the time put in not the guild they were in or the people they know.</p>

<p>and for every EQ player that returned 4 people replaced that EQ player on the wow servers. alot of EQ players I know are talking about going to wow because of the fact that they feel they cant gain significant ground in EQ in the amount of time they have to play because they cant find groups/solo.</p>

<p><br />
There it is.  EQ = EVERGRIND.  The game is SO vast that trying to put a dent into the content is very difficult.  70 levels combined with all the available aa's is a lot of work.  The game plods along at the same pace, i.e. slow, and is monotonous.  </p>

<p>There needs to be 'speed boosts' every once in awhile to catapult the player ahead to catch to the high-end.  The veteran-AA, Lesson of the Devoted, was a MUCH welcomed boost.  The initial talks of 'packaging' AA lines as rewards for mission arcs is also good to hear.  There needs to be more steps in this direction.</p>

<p>I'm a little saddened by the loss of the kicking moss snake.  It was a bug that became a 'feature'; it doesn't make any bit of sense but it was very entertaining.</p>

<p>I have to disagree with EQ ever defeating WoW.  The gameplay is too different to attact them to EQ.  WoW also has a huge fanbase with their previous games and from what I understand, a huge following in Asia (like Korea), I don't think EQ will ever get to compete with WoW in Asia.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that Combine Beta and Test are using the same code.  Having that many more people testing Test code seems to me like it'd actually help out.</p>

<p>Well, the pace of the game will radically alter once EQ manages to squeeze in an "out of combat" system, the amount of downtime that could be removed would be huge & consequently could be the major shift EQ needs to pull from the other MMO's.</p>

<p>Along with an improved reward of xp/& or AA/AA set for quests "THE GRIND"(tm)could be reduced to a secondary activity, & made an awful lot less painful.</p>

<p>Loral, just curious, have you been reading Nodyin's posts on hotzones and hit minor reitemization plans for the older expansions?  Some interesting thoughts there.  Basically, he's creating a few new named mobs per hotzone and having them drop more relevant loot for today's EQ.  Also, he's instituted a script where there's a chance that when beating on a mob, it will "call for help" causing a more difficult version of that mob to spawn nearby and attack the group.  That mob will carry the newer loot also.  </p>

<p>He plans to change the hotzones 2 to 4 times a year, and plans on these loot & mob changes to be permanent (will remain in zone even once hotzone status shifts).  </p>

<p>As an advocate of older expansions on live servers who is not planning on devoting much time to Combine, I find this an interesting draw to zones largely ignored.<br />

<p>I read about it last night and it sounded excellent. I was sad that I wrote the article before learning this but I might devote a whole article to it in the future.</p>

<p>Here was the post:</p>

<p><a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&message.id=241065&view=by_date_ascending&page=1">http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&message.id=241065&view=by_date_ascending&page=1</a></p>

<p>"I hope that everyone is enjoying the new Hot Zones released with the update this week. Now that the first players to hit the zones have had a few days to run through the content I wanted to discuss what some of you have already noticed, namely that there are some new items dropping in each of the Hot Zones.</p>

<p>This is something that we've wanted to do for some time now. I very nearly was able to itemize the Hot Zones that went live when PoR came out but we just weren't able to complete the items before that set of zones went live. Rather than tack on the items partway through the Hot Zone period I decided to hold off until we released the next set of items. This is not by any means a complete re-itemization of these zones and does not mean they were "revamped" in any way. New items were simply added to the zones in a variety of ways that I will discuss below.</p>

<p>The first and most obvious source of items in the new zones are the new named NPCs to be found in all of the Hot Zones. Some zones have more new named npcs than others but each zone should have at least one new npc. These NPCs have brand new drops that should be a bit more level appropriate for current day EverQuest than some of the items that might drop elsewhere in the zone and are older.</p>

<p>The second source of items are global rare items. A number of the Hot Zones have new global rares. In some zones nearly any NPC can drop these items. In other zones the global rares are restricted by race so only certain types of NPCs drop these items.</p>

<p>The final loot mechanism I used in the Hot Zones is something new I came up with for these zones - feedback is welcome! I did something I call the "Call for Help" mechanic. Basically it works like this....</p>

<p>Some (not all!) npcs in the Hot Zones will, during combat, realize they are in trouble and are not going to win. If they decide to call for help at this point a new NPC will spawn somewhere nearby. This NPC will be the same race as what you're fighting but will be just a little bit stronger. This new NPC will then run over and, well, start hitting you. Obviously a new NPC hitting you isn't fun so the up side to this is that the new NPC is a Named npc with loot that essentially spawned just for you and your group.</p>

<p>The chance of this happening is about the same as the chance to get one of the global rare drops found in the Hot Zones.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that this will add a bit of excitement and danger to normal experience grinding while offering a chance at some nice items in the process.</p>

<p>I hope you all enjoy the items and the zones in this set of Hot Zones.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Skuz on June 16, 2006 07:56 PM</strong></p>
<p>I really like what Nodyin has done there, just goes to show what a few changes in who does what can bring about.</p>

<p>This together with zone face-lifts, can really do a lot to make the game more interesting for new players (provided EQ somehow gets some prime time media exposure - perhaps tied in with the next expansion)</p>

<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Blackguard on June 18, 2006 08:01 AM</strong></p>
<p>Very frustrating listening to the WoW fanboys post in this thread.... the reason WoW has so many subscribers is because it is an "MMO starter kit"! It's easy... a game for the masses. To me, and many hardcore EQ players, that's a huge turn off. EQ is not dying.. it's evolving, into more of a niche market for the hardcore MMO gamer. IMO EQ is getting better, not worse... can't wait to see what the future expansions hold! I do agree that they need a graphics engine overhaul, hopefully they will see the light in that regard soon.. but other than that, there is nothing wrong with EQ!</p>

<p>so I guess thats saying EQ shouldnt learn from gates of discord a expansion that was hard core and turned off a majority of their players enough to quit and leave the game.</p>

<p>the fact of the matter is that the majority of EQ players are not hard core and dont want to be and pushing yet another gates of discord on them will only turn them off.</p>

<p>"we will see how long they play on the Combine server suffering through eight hour corpse runs in Fear or sixteen-zone runs to get back their bronze armor."</p>

<p>How can you still say that considering the sheer volume of people who have done EXACTLY that, willingingly, to become the level 70s of today.</p>

<p>A huge number of people did NOT find that a detriment, and a daresay those sorts of challenges led them to stay.</p>

<p>With these games being tailored to 'new players', I fear what is happening is that players are now able to exit the game as fast as they are entering. They can sweep through, say "Me for teh win" and move on to the next MMO because all this 'ease of use" has translated in fewer reasons to stay.</p>

<p>And lets face it, SOE is NOT well known for making compelling content as opposed to cookie cutter templates.</p>

<p>A huge amount of people I know in EQ have never done a true plane of fear raid. Plane of Hate yes, but not alot of people would raid fear.</p>

<p>I myself never did fear and only recently stepped into fear as a level 70. and I feel I have missed nothing by skipping fear.</p>

<p>I can see it easily.  The Difference between then and now is very simple.  then, we had no where to go. now, we can just leave and go back to our lvl 70 with 500 AA's once we remember exactly how crappy classic EQ was after a 8 hour Fear rebreak for lost corpses.</p>

<p>A scenario that will play out more often then not imo on the new Combine server once the "ooooh a Moss Snake" hysteria wears off.<br />

<p>"To me, and many hardcore EQ players, that's a huge turn off. EQ is not dying.. it's evolving, into more of a niche market for the hardcore MMO gamer."</p>

<p>The problem is that only a very small percentage of current Everquest subscribers are "hardcore". If you take hard core to mean high-end raiding or high-end level 70 players, there are far fewer active level 70 characters than those lower.</p>

<p>Everquest needs to bring in new players. It cannot survive as a super-difficult brother to the appeasing WOW unless it offers something substantially better than WOW. It will take more than 300 hps on a breastplate to get people to play EQ - it needs to be fun, challenging, rewarding, and playable. Many parts of EQ are just that but many others are too hard and offer too little of a reward so players just flock to the stuff they can do like Creator and Arcstone. Some see zones like this and the rewards offered there as broken content, too easy for people to acquire, instead of a clear view that most of EQ is too hard and the parts doable by most players need to be spread out. Making challenging content isn't useful if it ends up being Elddar, Devastation, Stronghold of Rage, and Relic. Those are challenging difficult zones and no one ever steps foot in them.</p>

<p>SOE needs to make fun, challenging, rewarding content for everyone, not just the top 1%.</p>

<p>i doubt the sony execs plan on spending the time or resources to totally re-vamp eq. they are doing all they are willing to in a effort to milk every last dime out whats left of eq and those that play it.i guess thats why they dont force the "devs" to make content that is more in touch with todays market.they just dont care enough to pump money in it or police up the devs from catering the game to "ubers" or excuse me....the hardcore niche,hahaha.how could eq be any other way then it is ? the devs that design the content are in uber guilds themselves. they basically are using the money for some 90 plus % of casuals that play to finance them making more uber content for themselves. i got to tell you....i have read alot of lorals' articles and posts before but i dont remember loral ever just out right laying the truth on the table like he did in a couple of posts before this one.im kind of shocked. </p>

<p>EQ = the suxxors compared to WoW and when Vanguard and Warhammer come out its going to be like EQ what?  Carry on for 6 more months with that weak ass progressive server.</p>

<p>Why do wow fanboi's post on EQ topics? Are wow players so stupid that they cannot sustain their own  news sites and forums for people to post on so their players have to troll EQ pages?</p>

<p>As far as the progression server keeping things alive I highly doubt it. Most of the people I know have no interest in it. You can never go back, EQ isn't all of a sudden gonna be new and unknown with the opening of the progression server.</p>

<p>It'll be hot for a month maybe two then it will die off. Many of the people who returned will fire up their old eq toons because the progression server will remind them of what they've been missing the past year or 2, Challenge.</p>

<p>Two years ago the mass exodus from EQ started with the betas for both wow and EQ2. That lasted about 8-12 months then people slowly started coming back. Because both eq2 and wow are dumbed down and most people who played eq need more challenge in their games.</p>

<p>And in response to the person that posted about the anniversary pricing, Sony sent out an email regarding it. If you were on the pricing last year you can resubscribe this year for the same price again. They had too much outrage over the way they screwed people over.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I wouldnt mistake these people for being fans of wow. because most of these people would leave wow just as quickly as they left EQ when the next big thing comes out.</p>

<p>Tanise,</p>

<p>You mention that people are coming back to EQ.  This is something I see posted often in online forums as a way of nay saying those that proclaim that WoW and other games have taken away from the player base of EQ.</p>

<p>Now before I go on, let me preface this.  I've been playing EQ for 6.7 years, and I'm co-guildleader of one of the oldest guilds on The Nameless.  My friends list has never had a single name on it removed, and our guild roster has never had someone removed from it for inactivity.</p>

<p>That said, I've seen not one "old friend" return, not one in over four years since I started to see a real decline in people.  In our guild roster not one person that was inactive two years ago has since logged his or her toon in, not even for a moment.</p>

<p>So I'm curious.  These masses of people that are in theory burnt out on WoW or EQ2 as they are so dumbed down, who seek the challenge that only being forever LFG, while 1% of the server screams through Monty Hall dungeons that they themselves will never see, can bring.  Where are they?  Who are they?</p>

<p>I really had some people return to my guild and EQ over time :-)</p>

<p>I also create an alt from time to time and am amazed to see some real n00bs in the newbie channel, as well as returned folks. Many complain about WoW.</p>

<p>Who remembers, "A fire beetle says, 'hit by non-melee damage for 15 pts!'" ??</p>

<p>That goes waaay further back than kicking snakes... <br />
And it was "live" for more than a year, long enough for people to ask that it be left in because, "polite talking beetles and snakes are a part of EQ". :)</p>

<p>IMHO, I think the progression server is a misnomer. It does not "progress" the game, it is a complete regression. Its a fun challenge only in a sense that its like a challenge playing American football (not soccer - the rugby derivative with sissy armor) with one arm tied behind your back. Sure it may be popular for a while like all novelties, but it sure won't make the game any more popular or improve it worth a dang.</p>

<p>While we're at it, whats with Vanguard? Am I the only one that feels, that all the progression servers will do is just hold on to the Brad Fanbois until Vanguard is released so he can take them all away? </p>

<p>11:30 pm PST on the Combine...</p>

<p>55 People in Ak'Anon.  /ooc was alive with people offer other people help, and not one condesending remark about *newbs*.</p>

<p>/sarcasm on</p>

<p>Oh yeah, this was a horrible idea, every one just hates it....</p>

<p>/sarcasm off</p>

<p>For the 1% or 2% of the game base that concider themselves l33t ubber raiders, who want that next expansion to have 4000 points worth of AA's and who can't comprehend why "casual" players don't want to have to solo grind out the first 1000 AA's in order to be allowed into a guild, only to be forced to skip 7 expansions worth of content as that guild no longer goes there; well your right, the progression servers probably aren't something your happy to see.  You see it as a waste of resources and time.</p>

<p>As a casual player though.  This rocks!</p>

<p>I am glad to see the progression servers start off so successfully. I personally don't desire the SLOW crawl through early Antonica without the other expansions, but i am happy so many others do. I wonder if the obvious desire to play the servers is due to playing EQ old school or being on a server where everybody starts off fresh at Level 1 without server transfers. It would have been interesting if they opened a totally normal server at the same time but didn't allow server transfers to it. That is a server that I would have signed up for.</p>

<p>I really do hope that the progression server(s) concept works out well.</p>

<p>But only as I would love to see them then try out a variation on that theme by having all races & classes in from the start, there are plenty of cities in the Old World to accomodate them, & I think it would be very interesting to see what the class/race balance would be on such a server.</p>

<p>Well glad to see that the progression servers are going as I thought they would. Already numerous people in the upper 20's and the server has been on line 2 days.<br />
Guess level 50 should be by next weekend and the first expansion online within 2 weeks. This is sure going to be a "long lasting" experience.<br />
The new Freeport is a royal pain in the arse. Whoever thought that they needed to "revamp" the zone and move things all over from where they had been for years needs a shrink. What a fiasco.</p>

<p>The progression servers are doing as I thought they would too and I've never seen so many people happy playing EQ again.  It's like a weight has been lifted off people's backs and they can have *fun* again.</p>

<p>Yes, the top 2% of people are leveling fast. So what. I'm level 8 wearing leather pants, a cloth cap and wielding a rusty sword and playing with 100's of others like me. Personally, I don't want to be level 50 when Kunark opens and I don't want to be level 60 when Velious opens. Those expansions have plenty for the mid level player and I look forward to playing there. So, let Kunark open in a month. Good luck getting Velious open that fast. Kunark begins a long line of time sinks that will halt things soon enough.</p>

<p>p.s. I solved the Freeport issue very easily. I started in Qeynos.</p>
