Awww, Just Look at the Screens</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-05-17</p>Ever wonder how the EQ team could announce a major expansion like <a href="http://www.everquest.com/luclin">Shadows of Luclin</a> and have it finished in such a short span of time?<br><P><br>Well, from the look of these Star Wars Galaxies Online <a href="http://www.starwarsgalaxies.com/media/screenshots.jsp">screenshots</a>, it wouldn't shock the Mobhunter team to learn that there was a sharing of technology between the SWGO project and the Luclin team.<br><P><br>That's a win/win for all of us. The EQ folks get to use the advanced SWGO character models as the basis for the Luclin characters, which would save lots of time and development costs, while we EverQuest players get to enjoy a huge leap in technology with a relatively short wait.<br><P><br>As for the Star Wars screenshots, well, there's no denying they're impressive. But I <I>still</I> won't touch that game with a 10-foot pole. Why? Because every sci-fi freak in the world is going to buy it and play it (note: only half the sci-fi freaks in the world currently play EverQuest), and I can't stand the thought of seeing fanboys calling their characters BoBaFeTt r0x0rsU and whatnot. Yeah, yeah, there will be a name filter, but you know what I mean.<br><P><br>I'll hang out with the freaks I already know, thank you. See you in Luclin.
