      <description>You want hard numbers? 

Here, hard real numbers:

Yea, EQ will die just as UO died, a game that awefuly droped to zero players over night due to greed... (sarcasm intended).

If ANY game there seems to be dying, it would be Asheron&apos;s Call. And guess what? They only ever set ONE expancion on the shelves. True, there is new content monthly but to get new playes in you must keep the game on the shelves and that is what expancions do.

Also note the diference between sudden changes and declines. CoH state does not worry me, mainly since an expancion for CoH is coming, but Asheron&apos;s Call and the Sims Online do.

If anything EQ will keep going for just as long as  UO has, so if you enjoy the game i would not worry. It must likely will leave the market only way after YOU are tired of it. Only thing i do note is it WILL leave the market eventualy, thing some people just dont accept.</description>

      <description>(Loral)We, as players, have no real idea how many players enter or leave the game.
---------------------------------

Not quite right.
I, as a player, have real hard data about how many players are playing.
When trader numbers in the (old) bazaar went down by 2/3 - the actual customer numbers are following.
When Sony closes half of their servers - there are no more enough customers.
When I have no chance to get a group, because there are no more groups (outside guilds) - the player numbers are dwindling.

PoP killed a lot of the smaller and mid sized guilds, it killed most familiy type guilds. The social networks took severe damage.
LoY was nice, it was aimed at the leaving players, but it was too little too late.
Everything after LoY was aimed at uber guilds only - the game went downhill.

Not even speaking about class balance or even usefullness of classes in groups/raids...
Sony made many bad choices there is nothing they can do to get those customers back.

Throwing out more expansions will alienate former customers even more - more levels to catch-up, more $$$ to buy them, more Items to farm, to be ready for actual content. And still not one long standing problem solved...

EQ is dead, like UO *g*
It was a great game, ruined by greed.

      <description>LoY wasn&apos;t the &quot;end of an era&quot; in and of itself, but LoY did mark the beginning of a decidely shorter development cycle, with more frequent expansion releases, targetted at specific styles and of play.

Is the game better off with this model?

Or did the game retain a stronger following before because we were made to wait a bit longer for what we really wanted?</description>

      <description>And you will enjoy it I am sure, Loral. Because now the game is being targetted at players like you, who already know the game intimately have experienced the cool content that noone does anymore. You have your communities to keep you going. You have your uber guilds recruiting still.

Maybe you have sentimental reasons for still playing. Maybe you met your wife here, maybe you feel attached to what remains of your guild. You write for Mobhunter!

Another reason for the decline of the game:

EQ1 used to cater for many kinds of players, even soloers really well, it really did. You could choose a class that soloed very well, it wasn&apos;t difficult to find out which class fit your playstyle. Many people chose their class because they could solo well, or group well. But it was their choice.

So why the hell did Sony make solo a &apos;four letter word;. I remember loads of people used to play their class solo and reach level 50+ You even had people soloing to 65 but they seemed to phase it out more and more. They reduced solo exp (idiots) and then increased the amount that groups get. Of course this means this is just a nerf in disguise, because all of their future content is balanced for the group. 

EQ1 had soloing options, they killed most of em off.

They made a lot of bad mistakes.

Sentimental value can&apos;t hold players forever.

      <description>&quot;Many would had quit a long time ago had the game never gained content beyond Kunark, no matter how many say they would play the game even more happily if it was so, truth is they would had borded sooner or later of the same content.&quot;

You and I agree completely.  The thing that drives the health of a MMOG is new and evolvoing content and features.

&quot;Thats when Sony released Legacy of Ykesha. My god, what have they done? The expansions lack the grandeur of previous expansions and the game is on the decline.&quot;

This is where perception comes in.  I think the two best expansions for EQ came AFTER Ykesha - LDON and DON.  I know my views are not everyone&apos;s but there are a lot of people who like the focus on single-group play.

I hope, as EQ ages, that we begin to form a smaller and tighter community with higher visibility to developers, more changes they might not have been willing to make, and a focus on content.

Money isn&apos;t everything.  Bad Boys 2 cost $125 million and Desperado cost $7 million but guess which one is the better movie?

Cutting budgets and limiting resources sometimes leads to some pretty innovative stuff.  You don&apos;t tend to rely on big giant flashy sets of forty zones like we got with PoP and Luclin.  Instead you get smaller expansions with a more radical system wrapped around it like DoN.

It&apos;ll be interesting to see how things turn out.  I like being there to see it.

      <description>Maybe I missed it, but I didn&apos;t see anyone say on this page that Everquest is dying. I don&apos;t believe it is, I simply said that the golden age is over for the game. 

An &apos;age&apos; for a fantasy piece of fiction could be 1000s of years. For modern times, 100s of years. For computer games, it&apos;s months! EQ changed it, started out with 25,000 ... grew to 450,000. We saw expansions increase our expectations of the game every time. Each expansion was a huge jump in what we came to expect... until after Planes of Power. I think the game reached its peak then. 

Thats when Sony released Legacy of Ykesha. My god, what have they done? The expansions lack the grandeur of previous expansions and the game is on the decline.

GoD gave us more bugs and game inbalances, like most mmorpg expansions, but most of all it took away the fun.

Omens was a good expansion, and it should have been released right after PoP - balanced for the lower gear of course. But by then it&apos;s too late. The new breed of mmorpgs is just around the corner.

The reason for this decline? Why have sony failed at keeping to keep game growing? There was a point where it was getting more popular all the time. What the hell was Legacy of Ykesha. Why is DoN so tiny? Where the hell is the fun. I

I&apos;ll tell you what happened. While these expansions of lesser quality were being churned out the company&apos;s energy was being directed elsewhere. Everquest 2. Why did they have to make this game. It still plays like EQ1, fecking levelling and grinding. So it has slightly different classes, I&apos;m still doing the same bloody thing that I did in EQ1. Feels like a different flavour of EQ to me.

WHY ! Don&apos;t tell me the games had different budgets, that&apos;s rubbish. They should have spent that money on EQ1 so the game got better looking and with better content. They could have done amazing things with EQ1.

Why couldn&apos;t they put player housing in EQ1? Why couldn&apos;t they completely revamp the low end game and balance classes when they were broken. Why did they nerf a class like a monk because they could tank rampage better than a warrior at the top %1 of the game, and then change it back years later.

They had the chance to make EQ1 grow forever or at least maintain a stable population. But they got greedy, they got franchises and they lost sight on what was important.

The golden age is over for EQ1. They&apos;re not even trying to compete with the mmorpgs like they used to do, they&apos;re just keeping it going and carved a niche for it.

Grrr.

I used to love EQ.

I hope blizzard don&apos;t do the same in 3 years time.

Damn it.</description>

      <link>http://mobhunter.com/000055.html</link>
      <description>Population may not have a big impact on MANY games, but in the case of comersial games like EQ, where profit is esential, it is.

True, they can go a long way down before they can&apos;t cut more corners to stay profitable, and until that day comes, the game will keep going, but dont expect that the constant new content that has become a norm trough expancions to keep going forever.

Many would had quit a long time ago had the game never gained content beyond Kunark, no matter how many say they would play the game even more happily if it was so, truth is they would had borded sooner or later of the same content.

EverQuest wont die any time soon, that is a fact. but it WILL die sooner or later, and unlike Meridian 59, I doubt SoE will be willing to sell the defunct game to anyone so the game keeps going.</description>

      <link>http://mobhunter.com/000055.html</link>
      <description>When Loral mentioned smaller MMOG&apos;s made me think of the games that my fiance and I take breaks playing.  
They are small third person, low graphic games, but with lots of content.  They are usually free for a period, or if you want to get into the better stuff.  One game I started playing before EQ a long time ago.  It is still around and I go back to it every once in a while.  It has low population, low graphics, and few upgrades in the last five years.  But it has a tiny following and keeps on going.  
So I agree population does not really have much to do with the death of a game. It has a lot to do with it being the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and making a lot of money for the Company.</description>

      <description>Ogul, great post.  What I think was said previously though was the point that there are many other MMORPGs out there that have much smaller populations.  Yes, they will begin to spend less money on expansions if the players begin to leave and others fail to take their place.  However, this doesn&apos;t mean lower quality expansions (at first).  It would begin with less &quot;new&quot; bells and whistles. ex: the bandolier buttons for EQ.  While that&apos;s all nice and pretty, SOE can save money on that stuff and keep up the new cool expansions.  It will become less &quot;we have this now, please come back&quot; and more &quot;try this out and stay with us.&quot;  Both will bring in new players, but it will be a long time before the actually quality of expansion dissipates. (like GoD before OoW)  Just my opinion.  Long live nachos.</description>

      <description>We, as players, have no real idea how many players enter or leave the game.  Our only real measure for the health of the game comes from the changes SOE invests.  While the total number of paying subscribers is the factor SOE looks at for the health of the game, as a player, my only concern comes from my own entertainment which is continually renewed with new content.</description>

I have to correct you there. As long as the game continues to bring new PLAYERS in it will not die.

Yes, expancions help with it, as they bring new shelf life to the game, but if the game starts loosing players faster than it gains them, sooner or later you will find that the production cost of an expancion actually becomes loss and not an investment with a return. It would only take 2 expancions that became losses instead of wins (balancing the new/returning players + sales of expancion vs the prodution costs) before they start cutting edges. 

I presume SoE may go for lower investment on the expancions before going for longer times in between if forced to. Altough many players may scream about it, it would be the wisest choise, sadly. Even so, a point will come where the fact that expancions dont bring new players or returning players comes and it will be the lack of player count that will kill the expancions, not the lack of expancions that will kill the player cont.

      <description>Here&apos;s what it comes down to.  I wrote about this in my brilliant and well-written article for Caster&apos;s Realm entitled &quot;Is Everquest Dying?&quot;:

http://loralciriclight.com/001248.html

There is one factor that will show the decay and death of a massive online game: a lack of growth.

Whether a game has one million subscribers or ten thousand is irrelavant when you consider that we never see more people than any one server hosts.

As long as games continues to bring out new expansions, it will survive.

We focus on three MMOGs at the present time: EQ, EQ2, and WoW, but there are over a dozen other massive online games still surviving and thriving with populations much lower than these three.  Certainly these three will continue as long as the companies hosting them continue to develop new expansions so that current players have something new to try out.

Although EQ plans to begin merging servers, they also plan to develop new expansions.  If you&apos;re enjoying EQ, it will continue to be around a long long time and you have little to worry about.

Although World of Warcraft has a lot of solo content and players easily reached the highest level, Blizzard will continue to bring out new expansions and new content to keep people interestd.  People who like WoW will continue to play.

Everquest 2 already has a mid-level adventure pack out, The Bloodline Chronicles, and they have plans to release two full expansions and two adventure packs a year.  That&apos;s a significant amount of new content every three months.

All of this is good for us players.  There&apos;s competition, there are choices, there&apos;s a huge pool of people all spending their working days to find new ways to entertain us in MMOGs and the really good ideas, like instanced content, missions, easier UIs, and quest journals, end up in all three games.

Everquest isn&apos;t dying.  Warcraft isn&apos;t dying.  Everquest 2 isn&apos;t dying.  The world of massive online games is just beginning and these grandfathers will tell their tale for years to come.</description>

      <description>Please, it&apos;s &quot;mindless and cowardly anonymous fanboi to you&quot;. Granted, I&apos;m probably a voice in a sea of hundreds of thousands saying the same thing you&apos;ve head 100s of times over.

People used to say I was a Verant fanboi too.

Those were the days.

Now is the hour of World of Warcraft. EQs golden age is over. Long live the king.</description>

      <description>I&apos;m all hears. How without provoking at least some of the critics concerning EQ. Exactly how will they.

Otherwise it&apos;s indeed just mindless fanboism. 0 facts to back it up.</description>
