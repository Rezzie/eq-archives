<h1 class="article_title">Notes from the West</h1>
<p>by Loral on June 10, 2005</p>

<p>I find myself with a moment to set quill to parchment and give you, dear reader, a glimpse at the treasures of the West.  This is not the sort of treasure you may be used to, glittering gems, jewels, or plates of gold (I lost 20 bucks at the slots in about twelve seconds).  I offer a far more valuable treasure: the golden vaults of knowledge.</p>

<p>Ok, enough metaphor.  This article will act as a working set of notes as this year's Fan Faire in Las Vegas, June 2005, continues on.  Keep an eye on this page for the latest notes and links to the articles and pictures of others.</p>

<p>Let us begin:</p>

<p>11:00 am, Friday 10 June:</p>

<p>The next expansion is called Depths of Darkhollow.  It appears to be an underdark-ish expansion but details will be thicker during the official announcement on Saturday.  The devs seem very excited about it and give the impression that they plan to take it in a new direction.  One unattributed quote: "No other MMORPG has done this yet".  We'll know more tomorrow.  Oh yeah, John Smedley, CEO for SOE, does a mean Axel Rose impression.</p>

<p>The new tutorial was also a big topic.  SOE plans to release the tutorial, a level 1 to 10 instanced zone with a variety of quests and missions, will be released in a single stand-alone format, both on CD and download.  New players can sign up for a station account and play the tutorial on a special server known as "escape".  New players can play up to level 10 without having to put in a credit card.  The tutorial has all new artwork, mostly from DON but some unique models such as the Kobolds.  This lets player get a good taste of EQ without having to commit anything more than download time.  </p>

<p>This whole package will be known as "Escape to Norrath".</p>

<p>Gemdiver, the manager for Caster's Realm, has an excellent <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=8993">article on the EQ Community Summit</a> including some great labeled pictures of the devs.</p>

<p>Kytheria from EQLive posted some <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Crier&message.id=140">excellent pictures</a> from the Summit.  If you look really closely you can see the top of my head.</p>

<p>At the present I can hear lord Brenlo mocking the players of the PvP tournament.  The winner of the level 50 tournament walks away with a 42" plasma TV so I imagine the competition is fierce.  Periodic release of lions into the arena helps keep people honest.</p>

<p>I have had many conversations with the EQLive developers including a couple of conversations with Craig Knapp, the Everquest producer.  Craig has an excellent wide view of the game.  He knows, as do the EQLive developers, what is important and what is not.  Fun and community are paramount.  Craig's enthusiasm for the "Escape to Norrath" trial and Rytan's work on the tutorial and the level 10 to 20 quests show their commitment to bring new players to EQ.  </p>

<p>All of the developers seem quite excited about the announcement of the new expansion.  No doubt, releasing the first information about an expansion like this to a live audience can be nervewracking.</p>

<p>1pm Thursday, 10 June</p>

<p>I posted some <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mikeshea/sets/438212/">Las Vegas Fan Faire pictures</a>.  I will be posting more of these throughout the day as well.</p>

<p>2pm Thursday, 10 June</p>

<p>Rumors and whispers about the new expansion run wild.</p>

<p>There was a lot of discussion about cheating and hacking and general customer support issues - a topic that gives me an ice-cream headache.  The programmers are building tools and techniques to trap a lot of the typical cheats.  A lot of the summit reps felt that better reporting on the numbers of cheaters caught and banned would help scare away cheaters and help the rest of us see that things are getting done.</p>

<p>SOE mentioned that they were seeing a fair amount of people returning to EQ after some adventures out in EQ2 and WoW.</p>

<p>I have a couple more details on the "Escape to Norrath" package.  Craig Knapp mentioned that the CD for the next expansion will include the 400 meg Escape to Norrath demo so that players can give the discs away.  Any deals for distributing Escape to Norrath on CDs in magazines or hand-outs at retail chains are still under discussion.  It wouldn't surprise me at all to see EtN passed out frequently on CDs.  </p>

<p>SOE wants to make it as easy as possible for new players to get a hold of the demo, install it, and get playing without difficulty or invasive requests for credit cards.  The trial also has an unlimited duration.  This isn't a 10 day or 15 day trial.  Players don't have to worry about installing it only when they have the most free time, players are free to play at their leisure before any commitment.</p>

<p>This is something that frustrated me with my purchase of WoW.  When I first bought Warcraft I found it interesting (frustrating) that I had to enter a credit card number before I was even able to patch or play a single day.  Aside from nice box-art I had no guarentee that I would like WoW at all (I ended up liking it a lot, but thats not the point).  A limited trial of some sort helps me see what I am paying for, especially when I have already paid $50 for the retail box.</p>

<p>I have had excellent responses to both <a href="http://mobhunter.com/000063.html">Loral's Evil Agenda, Las Vegas Edition</a> and <a href="http://eq2.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=8957">Loral's Evil EQ2 Agenda</a>.  It sounds like a few of these ideas have already been kicked around the SOE offices with positive responses.  Some of them, like the Plane of Knowledge issues, are very contested even within the dev team.  That is something we don't often realize.  Many of the arguments we have about uber vs casual or class issues or models or the focus on knowledge all happen in the halls of SOE before we ever learn enough to debate them ourselves.  The end result are decisions often built from the debates of many people, not just one person's single decision (even Smed).</p>

<p>Oops, another thing on Escape to Norrath.  If you log into Test, you will see the new server-based newbie chat channels.  The Escape server will be no different but nice folks, such as yours truly, are able to join that chat channel and help folks out from our live servers with a typical /join escape.newbie or whatever the channel happens to be named.</p>

<p>I suggested some sort of big-brother big-sister program and other folks chimed in by recommending that some system where helping newbies awards leadership experience.</p>

<p>Oops, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mikeshea/18564638/in/set-438212/">sai Maddoc</a> just sat down to me.  I must be in trouble...</p>

<p>2:36pm, Thursday, 10 June</p>

<p>Yes, Character Models...</p>

<p>The short answer: We won't be seeing character models any time soon.  SOE, all of those individual folks I mentioned above, are all interested in adding new character models.  They articulated the complexity a little bit (I get frustrated with players who micro-manage SOE so I try to avoid such statistics).  Each Luclin model, including new animations such as multiple weapon strikes, take up over one hundred individual animations per model with 32 models.  Each piece of different armor requires its own animations.  The total number continues to grow and grow.  The final number, 8.5 man years just for models alone, still doesn't include everything it would take to add new models.  I know nothing about character animation but the devs seem to shake their head when they talk about how the Luclin models were done.  Here's another interesting statistic: it takes the same amount of work to rebuild one new player race and sex that it takes to add in all of the new models in Dragons of Norrath - including the dragons.</p>

<p>When I brought up the new EQ2 models - a set of asian-friendly models soon to be released - I heard that there was no silver bullet for those models, it took a lot of time and it was part of the deal between SOE and the company hosting the asian servers to make it more friendly to that environment.  Here's a funny bit.  Moorgard stated that the asian audience demands mouse-movement and one-handed gameplay so they never have to put down their cigarettes.  That cracked me up.</p>

<p>SOE doesn't seem to hold the same worry that I hold.  They aren't concerned that a new set of models would not be well received.  After the mixed reviews I hear about Luclin models, WoW models, EQ2 models, and the new asian EQ2 models, everyone has a different opinion and paying 8.5 man years for models that may receive similar criticisms doesn't seem like a real good investment to me.</p>

<p>So we will have to see.  New character models are a topic SOE hears a lot.  By their words it is something they really want to fix.  New character models are not off of SOE's master to-do list but it isn't something we will see any time soon.</p>

<p>4:17pm Thursday, 10 June</p>

<p>I just got back from the "EQ: Progression of Power" discussions.  A lot of individual class issues were discussed with a general theme that life is really hard in Anguish and people seem do die a lot - go figure.</p>

<p>Here's a micro-list of topics and answers:</p>

<p>Blind, it's the human crash bug that even R.A Salvatore mentioned in the intro to Rogue's Hour.  The EQ team wants to fix it but its not a priority.</p>

<p>Endurance regen:  The devs built the current endurance regen based on no regen components.  They don't intend to have any endurace regen items or spells.  However, they recognize that downtime in general is a problem and hope to come up with a solution.</p>

<p>Ranger discs:  A ranger wondered why he hasn't received a disc since Kunark.  Since rangers have hybrid spells, the discs for melees are meant to make up for that.  There's no intention to add more ranger discs.</p>

<p>Cleric CH isn't enough anymore:  A cleric was concerned that existing heals aren't powerful enough for existing mobs.  The devs disagree.  It's hard for a reason.</p>

<p>Cleric Melee:  I didn't get the answer to this one but Saroc, the cleric represenative, asked what the intention is for clerics soloing.</p>

<p>PoP backflagging:  There are a lot of bugs with backflagging including holes in the quests and no way to track it.  Why don't they just open up everything up to Time?</p>

<p>Cleric Plate Class issues:  Clerics are a plate class but get eaten a lot.  The dev team recognizes the extreme gap between tanks and non-tanks.  Tanks can survive but non-tanks are completely destroyed.  There is no intent to let any other class really tank but they do see the gap growing.</p>

<p>Warrior's epic 1.5 and 2.0 clicky has too long a casting time when getting hit and no channeling skill means it will always be interrupted.  SOE will look at the problem but instant cast items "are bad".</p>

<p>Cleric invis:  SOE is looking for a way to stack invis potions and make improved invis potions easier to acquire.</p>

<p>Ranger bows:  Why is the epic not a bow?  Bow DPS is meant to trail behind melee dps because ranged attacks are safer than melee attacks with repostes, rampages, and AEs.  SOE didn't want to gimp the epic 1.5 or 2.0.</p>

<p>Will Pally DPS vs undead get increased?  There's a lot of weird issues with situational DPS.  In general, Paladins aren't designed to out DPS other DPS classes even against undead.  Rytan will look at the numbers vs undead, however.</p>

<p>Regeneration on raid wipes take too long.  Downtime is a big issue in general and SOE wants to address it.  However, you did die...</p>

<p>Loot all:  SOE wants to do this and it's just a matter of finding a time.</p>

<p>Stuns as they are on Lucy are not accurate.  SOE feels that the existing stuns, 5.2 seconds on NPCs, 10 seconds on PCs, is appropriate.</p>

<p>Delay death isn't enough.  A player feels that delay death isn't enough of a boost.  Frankly, an extra 250 hps feels like a lot for me.</p>

<p>Warriors with lightning reflex.  I don't remember what this was.</p>

<p>Shaman Craigs, the Shaman CH:  No complete heal will be further touched.  Rytan feels they go outside the intent of the game.  While heal improvements will occur, they will not occur with any of the three CHs.</p>

<p>I was just informed that Curt Shilling, EQ fan and major league baseball player, arrived.</p>

<p>6:47pm Thursday, 10 June</p>

<p>I added over twenty new pictures to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mikeshea/sets/438212/">Loral's Las Vegas Fan Faire photos</a>.</p>

<p>12:42am Friday 11 June 2005</p>

<p>We saw a preview for Depths of Darkhollow last night.  I have an article all written up and ready to go tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p>However, I can say that SOE may have found a way to solve the problem of level 20 friends and level 70 friends grouping together, the character archetype problem for groups and raids, and the unused content problem in one swoop.</p>

<p>Depths of Darkhollow lets you pick a monster and fight alongside your friends.  More details tomorrow but it looks very very cool.</p>

<p>Time for bed.</p>

<p>7:42pm 11 June 2005</p>

<p>It's been a crazy few days and I am bound to pay for it on Monday morning.  I just posted a full <a href="http://mobhunter.com/000065.html">Depths of Darkhollow</a> preview on both Caster's Realm and Mobhunter (there are very slight differences but mostly the same).  Everyone is really excited about it and the rumors run rampant.</p>

<p>I have a few other juicy tidbits as well.  It appears we will see a full geometric and graphical revamp of both Nektulos forest and the Plane of Knowledge!  Many times throughout the weekend, Craig Knapp has asked players what features would bring players together in one spot to find groups.  He suggested Minigames.  I suggested short-duration stackable buffs with regen and mana regen from a single unique NPC - just some bonus hp and mana for starting groups in this place.  Any other suggestions are welcome so post them here if you have a good idea.</p>

<p>There are only a couple of events left this evening.  I don't know how long I am going to last at the beach party tonight or how much more juicy information I might get as the night wears on and the alcohol runs free.</p>

<h1>Mobhunter Exclusive: Slap in the face!</h1>

<p>The escape to Norrath project is very similar to my idea I brought up several months ago here on mobhunter. I'll have to find the old post and maybe I and copy and paste it here. </p>

<p>Thanks for the follow-up, Loral, even the news on models was bad.</p>

<p><br />
My issue here is that they were rumored to be outsourcing the effort last YEAR at the previous summit.  8.5 man years is NOT all that much to a dedicated modelling/animation firm... and the only direct cost in time to SOE would be the management of that project and support for the outsourcing.  It is entirely possible we could have had new models and new animations by now, with only moderate impact on the release of DoN and DoDH.</p>

<p><br />
Instead, it's now 2005 and we are still using either 6 year old models, or 3+ year old models which were horribly unoptimized, with animations that the developers have freely admitted were largely unfinished.  Grumbuk has stated in the past that the luclin models are pretty much impossible to tweak or extend because they were done via a different process, and that it would actually be LESS work to redo them in the new process than to try and work within the old framework.</p>

<p>My gut sense is simply that the accountants at SOE don't want to pay for the change... and that is a very disheartening sign indeed, particularly given that the designers and developers are busy trying to attract new players to the game.</p>
</p>

<p>
<p>Yes, it is about money.  They could release new models with limited impact to the existing time frames but 8.5 man years (it's actually a lot more than that) is a lot of money and its not clear that it will help the bottom line of the game.</p>

<p>I always dread the model topic.  We know SOE knows we want it but the answer has been the same for a while:  We won't be seeing them any time soon.</p>

<p>By the way, keep watching the main article of this page.  I will be updating it every couple of hours.</p>

I find the character model issue unfortunate.  I seem to recall reading that Smedley said he wanted EQ to stand up graphically with the games being released today.  You can't do that without new character models (not to mention zone revamps.)</p>

<p>I've run into a few people (not a lot, but a few) that have said the graphics are the thing keeping them out of EQ.  8.5 man years is a lot of time, but if could pay for itself by bringing in more people to the game, and keeping people that are already here longer.  </p>

<p>I really hope this is reconsidered.<br />

<p>Shame they think that way about the models. I do can asure you, the current graphics SCARE AWAY NEW AND POSIBLE PLAYERS!!!!</p>

<p>I know people that tried the game and cursed me for recomending that aweful looking game to them.</p>

<p>New graphics wont directly increase sales on their own, that is obvious, but without them, many pick the boxes and put them back where they took them.</p>

<p>At the very least, they could apply the old model animations to the new ones...</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>Personally I think if they can completely remodel the old world with the same money it would cost to produce new models they should do that instead. as bad as luclin models are people notice how blocky some of the older world zones are sooner then the flaws in Luclin models.</p>

<p>in relooking at my desires. I would say..</p>

<p>1. Upgrade all old NPC models in old world zones to new ones. (useing old models for merchants in Rivervale just because they are Unique graphics shouldnt be a excuse anymore)</p>

<p>2. Upgrade all old zones graphically (moveing onto the older expansions if needed) because as fun greater fay was back then.. now its got terrible pathing. and chunky hills..</p>

<p>3. Upgrade all PC models to a new standard.. slimming down their CPU useage and makeing their movement more flowing.</p>

<p>From 1-3 graphic wise that is where I would stand should sony stand up today and say we have the money to do the stuff you want.. but only one at a time.</p>

<p>They have already begun replacing old-world mobs with the new DON versions.  New zones aren't likely but new missions in old zones are quite possible as the Unrest mission showed us.  Rebuilding the graphics to old world zones isn't likely to bring players back there without all new content as well.</p>

<p>However, I have it on high authority that a full graphical and geometric rebuild of Knowledge is being discussed.</p>

<p>When someone doesn't want to do something they "embellish" how difficult it is to accomplish to prove their point.   Happens all the time.</p>

<p>While there is no question new character models would take effort I think the 8.5 man years as a red herring. They don't want to do it. Remember, they didn't want to instance Time saying it was impossible. </p>

<p>It is up to the players to demand it. <br />

<p>
<p>Loral,</p>

<p>Thanks for the update. Have fun and try and win your money back.</p>

<p>I was thinking about your first item on your Evil Agenda: Help people find groups, and the discussions about the LFG tool.  </p>

<p>Add the capability to share your current task progression, or mission progression in the LFG tool. I can decide to share my progression level, and others should be able to quickly see the LFG players that are working on the same tasks / progression. If I log on and want to work on the next group task that I need for progressions. I should have asimple way of finding all the other players that are up to my current task. I know you can type it in the remarks section, but it should be more user friendly. If I could quickly see that a healer and tanks type are also at the task: Snowfoot Revenge, than I can send them a tell and try and team up and complete that task together.  It would be benificial to all the group memebers, and may assist in grouping up.</p>

<p>I like the new escape server. One thing I would suggest.  Prior to allowing a new person the option of transfering to a Live server, he should be given the number of people on the Live server that are in his normal grouping range.  The escape server is going to give the illusion that all the Live servers have an significant number of low level players on it. A person flies through 10 levels and has no problem grouping up with other players.  He transfers to a Live server and gets stalled because the server he is on, has limited people on it for him to complete his 10-20 armor quests.  This brand new motivated player will quickly fall into a LFG cycle that is not fun to sit through.</p>

<p>Mentor experience and Mentor abilaties, might encourage people to drop down levels and help others.  I picked a certain race and class because that is what I wanted to play, and progress with.  Why would I want to continually become another different class and help lower level players out if I am delaying my main character's progression?</p>

<p>Woot for the loot all button. Thanks for adressing it.</p>

<p>I hope your Real Life dice are better than my EQ dice.</p>

<p>
<p>The notes feature of the LFG tool lets you advertise exactly what sort of flags or progression you wish.  Tasks become more of a problem considering there is a limit to the amount of time you can accomplish a task if you leave the zone.</p>

<p>I believe, and I will reconfirm this, that the Escape server will recommend a single server for new players to join so players who don't already know what server they are going to should find a nice set of new players on the recommended server.</p>

<p>The new Depths of Darkhollow expansion opens up all new possibilities to hunt with lower level players.  Hopefully this helps as well.</p>

<p>If you have a particular clas syou like - such as heavy blasters - there will be blaster class types for the monster mobs.  I'll have a full article about Depths of Darkhollow up later today.</p>

<p>
<p>I know a lot of you are thinking that focusing on newer players is a waisted effort, but if what Loral is saying is true then it surely looks as if SOE doesn't agree with you. </p>

<p>SOE's latest attempt to retake the lead in MMOs seems to be a complete flop. The numbers I've seen shows EQ to have over 100,000 more active subscriptions than EQ2. Meanwhile, WoW has about million accounts give or take a hundred thousand or so. </p>

<p>SOE's best bet is to refocus on EQ and try to capture more and more players there. The MMO market is becoming a force to be reckoned with, so unlike a lot of you, I think EQ can only become more popular. EQ needs to market its history as the revolutionizer in MMOs and work over the next 2-3 years to completely redo the older content on the game and bring it to new standards. </p>

<p>I think that one of the next few expansions should take the opportunity to be the expansion with new graphics. Imagine how many copies of that expansion would sell? </p>

<p>Add to that, every other month EQ should release a revamped zone. Not all of the zones should be higher level content, but I would think more of them should include higher level content. The revamped zones of similar levels can be new hubs for players to find pickup groups. Despite what many think, having zones that people crowd to is a *good* thing - you're sure to find a group there. So, with fewer low level and mid level zones, people won't be spread out. Lastly, all underutilized zones need to have a purpose - they should be loaded with quests, tasks and perhaps unique merchants that sell things you can't buy anywhere else. The quests and tasks must offer rewards and many of them should be soloable. </p>

<p>With these changes made - new players would be attracted to EQ, those new players would stick with EQ (by having condensed zones to group, it would be easier to find groups and level) and it would still have the epic feel EQ has by having many zones loaded with quests, tasks, merchants and hopefully great lore which keeps them well travelled by those who enjoy to do that and by those who feel they want to accomplish a task in about a half hour and be greatly rewarded for it. </p>

<p>Loral, level cap increase or not?  Please tell us before you head out and get drunk.  Oh and AA's?  Could care less about content or mentoring fluff.</p>

<p>No level cap increase but about another couple dozen AAs.</p>

<p>Not that its at the forefront of everyones mind, but did anyone hear anything if they are EVER going to fix the old world boats?  I don't mind the transloacters, but the boats should still be there too.  I think it detracts from the roleplay element that the boats aren't used any more :(</p>

<p>okays lets look at this 8.5 man  years in depth.</p>

<p>that means to redo all models would take 1 man, 8.5 years, or 3102 days.</p>

<p>if you have a team of 10 men, it would take them 310 days. if you have a team of 100 men, it would take them 31 days or about 2 months work.</p>

<p>now, lets say each of these people is paid 1000 dollars a week, 8000 dollars per person for the projext, this would make a total of 800,000  for the whole project in monetary costs.    i believe even if you double or triple this figure just for the sake of it, that EQ makes more money for sony in 1 at definetly 2 months, to pay for this project.....   thank you.</p>

<p>Wow.  Um...</p>

<p>Couple of points:</p>

<p>Employees actually cost the company about 180% of their salary; the rest goes to payroll taxes, insurance, benefits, their share of office space/power/equipment, etc.</p>

<p>100 licenses for Maya Complete (the cheapest professional-level modeling package, assuming they need no plugins or extras) would cost $200000 or so.</p>

<p>100 computers to run Maya Complete would cost at least that amount, and very probably more.</p>

<p>While EQ might gross $800000 a month (I don't know current subscriber figures, and the Station Pass makes it more difficult to guess), presumably the rest of the developers would also like to get paid while these 100 people redo all of the animations.</p>

<p>You can't build, texture, or animate models in a vacuum.  You must build the base model before you can rig it or UV it.  It must be rigged before it can be animated.  It must be UV'd before it can be textured.  Apparently it must have the armor geometry added before the additional armor animations can be worked on. 100 people could not simultaneously begin this project and have it done in two months.</p>

<p>Assuming it is possible to start from scratch with a more modern animation system (which may or may not be possible within their engine -- I don't know), you're still looking at 32 models (each at least a person-month to build, rig, UV, and texture) with 4 sets of armor geometry each, who knows how many unique armor textures, and then they have to animate.</p>

<p>It's do-able, but it would be comparable to hiring an entire game studio's worth of artists, then having them work for half a year on product that is already released.  I want new models too, but I can't see how this looks like a good investment to anyone.</p>
