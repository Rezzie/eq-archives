So have we. If you want to see what it looks like for yourself, here's your lucky chance... maybe.<p>If you happen to be a subscriber to GameSpy's premium service, you can <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/september02/ac2/">download the beta for AC2</a> today--if you're one of the first 10,000 who try. Of course, if this is the first you're hearing of this news, you're probably already too late. Anyway, the service is $60 a year or $7 a month, and it does allow you to get betas that you might not otherwise be able to.<p>Over the next few days, GameSpy will be posting articles on various aspects of AC2. From what they've written about the <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/september02/ac2/combat/">combat system</a>, the game has some promise. Check out this bit about skill training:<p><B>There's always going to be a &quot;most powerful&quot; character, no matter how hard we try to balance things out, one well-chosen group of skills will return more for the investment than a haphazardly chosen group. However, because we allow you to un-train your skills and recover experience and skill points, players won't be locked in to the latter skills. They can change their character over time and sellback the &quot;bad&quot; skills and outfit their character with the &quot;good&quot; ones.</B><p>An interesting concept, though if left unchecked that ability to untrain skills would really make for some generic characters, since everyone will gravitate towards the most useful abilities. Ultimately the trick is to make the player choose between several skils that are <I>all</I> useful, not from one or two that are useful and a bunch of others that suck.<p>Relating to EverQuest, I thought the Alternate Advancement system was a great idea, but Verant kind of missed an opportunity for truly specialized characters. Rather than let melee train both combat avoidance and damage mitigation, for instance, why not make the character choose one path and then close the other? This would allow for different kinds of tanks in different situations. (Yeah, yeah, assuming avoidance and mitigation both worked right. I'm speaking hypothetically here.) Instead, people who can play for 12 hours a day simply max out their AA points and train everything, resulting in characters that have the same skills as everyone else yet again.<p>My hope for EverQuest 2 is that character specialization will allow for a variety of types of each class without excessive overlap, and that each variation of a class can be useful. Maybe a druid could choose to be a better healer, as opposed to another who chooses to be better at damage-based spells.<p>It's a dream, anyway.<p><BIG>Consolers Get Theirs</BIG><p>Not to be out-beta'd, Verant has announced that the <a href="http://everquestonlineadventures.station.sony.com/beta/">beta for EverQuest Online Adventures</a>--you know, the PS2 game--will open soon. Click the link to apply, assuming you have the necessary hardware. You need the new network adaptor thing, a memory card, and an Internet connection.<p>From what I've been told by people who have played it, EQOA is fun, and surprisingly rich in depth and content. I'd be tempted to try it myself, except for that whole needing-a-PS2 thing. The chance to kill Dorn B'Dynn's great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather is pretty darn tempting.<p><BIG>RTFM</BIG><p>In case you weren't aware, part of the recent change to Sony's EQ Live site was the addition an <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/index.jsp">online manual</a> that can be kept much more up to date than the printed variety. And unlike the manual supplements that show up with patches, you might actually read this one. You can view printer-friendly versions of each page and make hard copies if you so desire. It's certainly worth printing out <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/printfriendly.jsp?id=48064">chat commands</a>, for instance.<p><BIG>You're Having a New Effect on Me</BIG><p>As mentioned a while back, you have been downloading pieces of a new particle effects system for a while now. For the first time, you can check out some of the new effects on the Test server. Casters Realm has a page of <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/screenshots2/default.asp?category=16">images</a> if you don't feel like levelling up a new toon just to see them. There are big wolf heads, armors, floating leaves, and other such things. Here are some specifics from the latest Test server patch message:<p><B>- We've implemented a &quot;Near Clip Plane&quot; for the new particle engine. If you're drowning in particles too close to your face, you can make this number larger to cause EQ to &quot;clip out&quot; particles very close to you. This is stored as NewParticleClipPlane in your eqclient.ini. For now, you can change it there. <p>- The particle density for the new particles is controlled by the option &quot;NewParticleDensity&quot; in your eqclient.ini. The range to work with is 0.0 to 1.0. <p>- Unlike the first version of this patch message stated, commands such as /showspelleffects won't effect the new particle system.</B><p>They certainly look sweet, though we have to wonder how resource-intensive they will be. The strain on my graphics would have to be pretty light for me to want particle effects on under pretty much any circumstances. But for those who play more casually or don't raid a lot, the new effects might be a nice treat. And to those of you who whine whenever Verant releases a new feature instead of fixing some bug that bothers you... just cope.<p>Speaking of Casters Realm, you can check out Mennix's <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/articles.jsp?id=51446">interview with Baelish</a> over on the EQ Live site. Now maybe you can poke fun at another Web site guy for a change instead of me! /sniffle<p><BIG>Still More Test Junk</BIG><p>Test server, Test server, blah blah blah. Well, here's more stuff of note from the latest patch message:<p><B>- Deleting Spells from Spellbook: Storebought spells are now deletable from your spellbook. To delete a spell, right click it to highlight it and tap the DELETE key. Please note: This does not convert the spell back into a scroll. You will have to buy a new scroll if you wish to re-scribe the spell. <p>- Item Links: When you inspect an item with Alt-LeftClick, the item inspect window stays up. To paste a &quot;link&quot; to the item you're looking at into your chat bar, click on the item's graphic. That will &quot;speak&quot; a link that others can click on to see the stats of the item, as if they were inspecting it themselves. <p>- Clerics now get the BASH skill at level 25 and it progresses all the way to level 60. <p>- Altered Mage AA Frenzied Burnout to no longer make the pet suicide at the end. <p>- Higher level PCs will be more resistant to lower level NPCs' spells. <p>- Warder's Protection should have considerably fewer stacking and overwrite issues. Thanks to the folks at the Ranger's Glade for all of their help in tracking this down. (Ow. No pun intended.) <p>- Druid Damage Shields should now all stack in the correct order. <p>- Druid HP buffs are no longer overwriting stronger cleric HP buffs.</B><p>All pretty good stuff--especially the item stats thing. Stacking fixes are welcome, as is the ability to delete crappy old spells from the spellbook. Allowing high-level players to more easily resist the spells of low-level NPCs is a good thing, too. While I'm still very much in favor of the change to NPCs a while back that made them cast smarter spells, I was not real keen on getting nuked hard by green-conning mobs.<p>Also <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=31363.topic">rumored</a> to be on Test right now is that warriors, rogues, and monks get the Physical Enhancement AA class skill that was previously only for hybrids. While the &quot;pure&quot; melee classes are happy, hybrids see this as another slight, and of course everyone is using the opportunity to say that monks are still overpowered. As none of us Mobhunter geeks has a worthwhile character on Test, maybe someone there can confirm this little tidbit for us.<p><BIG>Drivers Wanted</BIG><p>The latest version of <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp">NVIDIA's drivers</a> actually does seem to make a bit of a difference on my GeForce 4 Ti4400. I notice slight framerate improvements in the Bazaar, for example--not huge, but noticable. Csenicier's gimpy GeForce 3 Ti200 doesn't seem affected, though, so your mileage may vary.<p>Get it? Drivers... mileage? This is why I make the big bucks, folks.
