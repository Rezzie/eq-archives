And when he <I>doesn't</i> talk, it seems people pay just as much attention.<p>A thread sprang up on the Druids Grove in which <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=31207.topic&amp;start=9&amp;stop=9">Alan responded</a> to claims that SOE hadn't lived up to their &quot;coming soon&quot; promises. After clearing up the matter, Absor then attempted to <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=31207.topic&amp;start=31&amp;stop=32">elicit ideas</a> for changing the impression that druids aren't wanted in exp groups.<p>Of course, when folks see Alan post in any thread, what generally happens is you see a bunch of non-related responses that amount to requests for EQ's community guru to come read some other class board and respond to their issues. When it happened once again, this lead to <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=31229.topic">miffed druids</a> not wanting their threads derailed and <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=24416">other classes</a> raising questions of favoritism. Does Alan like druids best? Is it because &quot;Absor&quot; is so close in spelling to &quot;arbor&quot;?<p>It is true that you see more posts from Alan and other SOE types on boards that are known for mature and reasonable discussion rather than rants. Additionally, there are sometimes other factors involved. Alan stated that he didn't post much on the necro board due to the language used there (prompting the creation of a moderated forum to encourage official posts), and he doesn't post on the monk board because it's owned by Yantis and his auction empire.<p>Those are pretty understandable reasons for not posting in certain places. And while Alan's job is to listen to what the community is saying, it's not his job to respond to every single &quot;hey Absor&quot; thread that pops up.<p>And yet, some players do feel disconnected and unlistened to, and not without cause. After all, it's not the fault of the average monk that Yantis bought their message board--that decision was made without community input. Nor is every necro to blame for the bad behavior of a few posters. So how can these players voice their concerns and feel as if they're being acknowledged by the powers that be?<p>I think SOE is making an effort to show that they are working on issues that concern the playerbase with the introduction of the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/index.jsp">Game Updates</a> pages. But I'm sure ideas for other ways to help dispense warm fuzzies to the masses would be appreciated by Alan in particular. So what about it? How can Mr. V reach out and touch you? Let's see you post some ideas below.<p><BIG>An Offer You Can't Refuse</big><p>A <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/6019958.htm">recent article</a> about online gaming is interesting in a couple ways. First, for the story itself: it seems life in the land of Sims Online isn't just about dating and going to shopping malls. Apparently there is a gangland hierarchy in the game that makes the nastiest PKers in Shadowbane look like little old ladies.<p>The seemingly innocuous world of the Sims has protection rackets, robbery, identity theft, and other Mafia-like bullying to force players into bowing down to various overlords. If you're tired of waiting for new episodes of <I>The Sopranos,</i> you need only subscribe to this online world and fugidabowdit.<p>The other reason this article is interesting is the way it's written. Over the past few years, the majority of stories about online gaming published by respected news sources (in this case, Knight Ridder) have sort of a &quot;look what these goofy Internet people are doing&quot; tone. But in this case, the story is a straight report of actual news, without any geek factor whatsoever.<p>Does this mean that online gaming has finally penetrated the mass media and become an acknowledged part of everyday life? It certainly seems like an encouraging step. The constant portrayal of online gamers as obsessed suicidal freaks does tend to get a bit old after a while.<p><BIG>The Nerf Bow Cometh</big><p>A group of rangers over on the <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fprexus81531frm7.showMessage?topicID=2443.topic">Prexus server</a> took down Sontalak the other night in a rather impressive display of what archery can do. Of course, anytime a single class of players takes down a mob that used to give an entire guild fits, an outcry is sure to follow.<p>In this case, a group of elementally equipped rangers in full raid buffs managed to eke out a victory over the Temple of Veeshan's nasty old guardian. Ripples went out through the online community, recalling how wizards with the pre-nerf version of manaburn were taking out old-world targets and charging large sums of plat for the looting rights. <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=39612.topic">Debate arose</a> about whether rangers should see a nerf because of their show of force, given what happened with manaburn.<p>Is archery overpowered? When you combine all the disciplines and AA abilities that affect archery, you can certainly make a case that it is. Clearly SOE overcompensated when fixing rangers, much as they did when changing rogues from an all but useless class into the top melee damage dealers. Should rangers be nerfed as a result? Absolutely not. The game has been tuned to take the current power of archery into account, so any major decrease in player power would do nothing but unbalance the game.<p>Generally the classes upset about the power of archery are those that feel they lack a similar ability to contribute meaningfully to fights. Again, a lot of this comes down to the disadvantages that many pure melee are facing. Rangers can dish out huge amounts of damage in a short period of time, and, like a caster, can do so from a safe distance. Although warriors and rogues can add a little bit of extra damage with bows, monks can do little but lob slow, low-damage weapons at mobs. While rangers should always do the most damage via ranged melee attacks, other classes should at least be able to do something that makes a difference.<p>Nerfing should be the last resort of game balance, except in cases of gross errors that cannot be corrected any other way. Archery is a bit of a mistake, but one that the game needs to live with. What's needed to balance the scales is for other classes to have similar defining abilities that make them powerful and desirable. Plus, it's just cool to kick ass every once in a while.<p><BIG>With Sympathy</big><p>Our best wishes go out to Povar's <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/">Triton guild</a> who just lost one of their members in a most tragic way. A monk named Makavelie interceded in a real-life brawl to stop two guys from beating up a third. One of the attackers had a gun, and took Mak's life in a sad act of brutality.<p>People who play EQ die; that's just a reality of life. But seldom do we hear stories of such acts of true heroism as in the case of Makavelie. His bravery and sacrifice should not be forgotten.<p>Our deepest sympathies go out to Shane's real life family and friends as well as his online family.
