<h1 class="article_title">Secrets of Faydwer Preview</h1>
<p>by Loral on November 04, 2007</p>

<p>The world of Everquest moves ever onward. Last week, under the careful guidance of Rashere, Everquest's lead designer, I was able to preview the strange new worlds found in the Secrets of Faydwer, Everquest's fourteenth expansion. Overall the expansion looks strong. It contains many new zones, over thirty missions, multiple tiers of equipment progression, five new levels, and a focus on single group hunting. The clockwork theme may either excite players or leave them cold, but the design looks excellent. Whether it includes enough to hold players for an entire year, especially in this post WoW world, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The story of Secrets of Faydwer involves the gnomish necromancer, Meldrath the Malignant, who unveils a floating fortress over the lost lands of Faydwer. Were-orcs, powerful undead, brownies, and the mechanical creations of Meldrath all threaten those who enter the lost lands. Secrets of Faydwer also continues the story of the Sleeper, the dragon Kerafyrm lost since the last days of Velious.</p>

<p>Graphically, the new expansion looks excellent. The brownie village and the new Crushbone-like dungeon of were-orcs feels like something you would see in Everquest 2, not Everquest. This game has come so far since the low-resolution flat textures of the original release in 1999. Like other expansions, Secrets also upgrades one of the older zones, this time Steamfont Mountains. The graphics of the new draconic zone is beautiful but still remains true to the artwork and architecture of previous draconic zones such as Skyshrine and the Sleeper's Tomb.</p>

<p>SOE chose to remain conservative with the expansion of Everquest. This is a smart move considering the <a href="http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2005/12/69816">general negativity of the massive changes to Star Wars Galaxies</a>. Everquest has evolved quite a bit over the years, but each evolution is a small change to the larger and consistent game built eight years ago. Secrets of Faydwer includes many refinements implemented in previous expansions including single group instanced missions and a tiered spell system. Secrets of Faydwer doesn't include any specific new gameplay features, but rather chooses to focus on enough zones, missions, equipment upgrades, and character level improvements to keep players busy for the next year.</p>

<p>Remaining conservative with Secrets of Faydwer is a good move considering the recent radical inclusion of a collectable virtual card game in both Everquest and Everquest 2. Attempts at revolution can still take place, but with as much hanging on the line as there is for Secrets of Faydwer, it is best to focus on the areas that have clearly worked and keep the radical ideas in the incubator a while longer.</p>

<p>Secrets of Faydwer marks the end of the six month development cycle for Everquest expansions. Instead of continual progression every six months, we now have a twelve month period of time until the next large set of content comes out. Secrets of Faydwer is built to give enough content for both raiders and non-raiders to, hopefully, fill those twelve months. Five new levels and a multi-tiered equipment progression system are two ways they hope to keep people playing over this period.</p>

<p>While The Serpent's Spine was intended to rebuild the lower and mid-level game of Everquest, Secrets of Faydwer focuses on the high level game. Secrets includes four tiers of content for players who prefer single-group hunting and high-end raids beyond the power of the current highest power raid zone, Solteris. While most Everquest expansions offered zones, encounters, and equipment for both raiders and single group hunters, the lead designer's description of Secrets of Faydwer focuses on high level single group play.</p>

<p>However, Secrets will contain twenty eight new high-end raids many above the current top raid zones for those few guilds who have cleared such areas. Secrets of Faydwer includes two raid zones with multiple progressive raids all above the Solteris level.</p>

<p>Equipment progression is one of the few main differences between Secrets of Faydwer and previous expansions. Equipment power will go up in large amounts in order to build tiers that require a certain power of equipment before one can proceed. In order to ensure players cannot jump a tier, the power of this gear will have to be high. No specific numbers were mentioned, but expect to see much higher power equipment than in previous expansions which leaned towards more conservative gains. This tiered equipment power level is a cornerstone in ensuring that Secrets will keep players busy for a whole year.</p>

<p>This expansion also marks a turning point in SOE's marketing for Everquest. Rather than releasing a single stand-alone expansion, SOE will release only a compilation pack that includes the basic game and all expansions. This is a dizzying amount of content in a single box; over four hundred unique zones and instances. If one considers the cost of the original game and $30 for each expansion, it includes over $400 worth of expansions for $40. However, for those of us who actually bought every expansion, this $40 pack is the only way to purchase it. That's a $10 price jump over the traditional expansions. Given the amount of time people spend in game, that's still not a lot, but at this price point one must consider it against the equally priced Burning Crusade expansion for World of Warcraft.</p>

<p>One sure way to ensure the success of an expansion is to include a character level increase. Secrets of Faydwer takes characters from level 75 to level 80 including all of the spells, disciplines, and alternate ability increases included with any level increase. These levels should take roughly the same amount of time as leveling from level 70 to level 75. Each time the level limit increases, older spells and equipment falls out of power. Focus effects on previous high-end raid equipment will become reduced or go out completely. All of this helps to push players forward into newer and more powerful areas but sometimes not without complaint.</p>

<p>Secrets of Faydwer has a lot to offer and, with the need to keep players involved for a year, it better be good. SOE took the best pieces of previous expansions and built it into a single large expansion with a focus on high-end single group play. Multiple tiers of loot, five new levels, and new high-end raids should keep players busy but, with a new Warcraft expansion on the horizon and the strength of Warcraft overall, SOE has an uphill battle to keep what players it has and to bring any new players in. From everything seen in the preview, however, Secrets of Faydwer looks to be a strong expansion.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: ElemLap on November  7, 2007 11:53 PM</strong></p>
<p>This is a nice review Loral, thanks!</p>

<p>It seems this expansion would be interesting for the existing players who have not quit EQ after all these years of dealing with Class, Group and Content problems... And the nerfs hitting once beloved classes here and there. </p>

<p>The $40 price for Secrets of Faydwer which includes all of the previous expansions does not actually make difference in attracting of the NEW players. <br />
It would just make slightly less expencive for the existing players to start the second account to be able bot their own alt, powerlevel them etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am curious where would SOE find new players willing to spend two to three years of casual play time to gain levels from 0 to 80, along with 500AA, being forced to solo trough levels from 0 to 60 or so?!<br />
All that bearing in mind that by the time such new player would get to level 80 their Class would possibly go trough few revisions (read - nerfs) and would no longer be interesting to play exactly at the levels one would try to reach?</p>

<p>Actually, I would be willing to pay $15 a month to be able start the new character at the Level 75, with 500AA's and decent equipment on some new Server for players who would prefer to skip the slow initial character progression and development.<br />
But it is a BAD idea, of course ;)</p>

<p>Therefore I'll be doing what I am doing - playing some newer and less problematic games that are fun :)</p>

<p>PS<br />
/sigh<br />
I use to love EQ!</p>

<p>Any news on when the new WoW expansion is being released?<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Johnny on the Spot on November  8, 2007 01:36 PM</strong></p>
<p>Actually Everquest will continue it's revitalization imho. By taking the "conservative" or incremental approach to balancing issues and new ideas, etc, EQ provides more stability than games like Eve Online which is writhing from the convulsion of having it's natural progression ripped from it's chest through dramatic nerfs. </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Teremar on November  9, 2007 12:03 PM</strong></p>
<p>Level cap increases certainly do sell expansions, but they also make old content obsolete. Combine that with new tiers of gear that are a substantial improvement over the past, and it sounds like SoF will be the most mudflationary expansion since at least PoP.</p>

<p>So it sounds like for at least non-raiders the expansion will be the game. The only people with a reason to do the older content on a regular basis will be those who are behind the curve and don't meet the requirements for SoF yet. That's not necessarily bad: it's how The Burning Crusade worked in WoW, and it looks like the next one will be similar (no, no date yet ASIC).</p>

<p>But it does raise the stakes. If SoF is a great expansion and has enough content to last the year until the next one, all is well. But if it turns out to be a bad expansion (and some have) people can't just ignore it. They'll end up quitting instead.</p>

<p>I have to comment on nerfs and changes too: my experience ranged from early Velious to Omens of War, and if you compare hunting in Old Seb "back in the day" to BoT or VT or WoS or MPG, the playstyle really is quite different. It tends to sneak up on you though, because of a couple clever things SOE did: 1) they mostly introduced changes in new content rather than changing existing content and 2) the most important changes were made not to the player characters, but to the mobs and zones.</p>

<p>.. </p>

<p>and that is the big reason WoW is doing so great in comparison. people may make fun of it and call them names in EQ but World of Warcraft does not require you bring friends to enjoy and when the low levels become sparse and thinned out it will still be fun for people because of the ease of playing the game.</p>

<p>I miss the game that was simple enough that you could just go to Thurgadin or Shadow Haven and talk to people and learn everything there was to know. Finding groups wasn't tough and everything you earned you felt was special. Those times are long gone though especially in EverQuest and I don't know if there will ever be another game that can replicate those feelings, at least not for me.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Redhenna on November 11, 2007 01:56 AM</strong></p>
<p>Aarkan, I think that alot of those feelings are gone for good, not so much because of changes in EQ, or MMOs in general, but because of changes in us.  I remember the exquisite thrill if running at level 10 from Qeynos to FP, the wonderfull feeling when some older player gave me 5pp just to help me get going, being in awe of that level 35(!) player standing at the Qeynos gate.  Those where great times.  In trying other games, none have ever even come close to replicating that.  I am left with the belief that the problem is not with the games, it's that the genre is no longer new to me, that I know I can recover from a mistake, that in a couple weeks, I will be that level 35 player, and so on.</p>

<p>It took me over 2 months to get a character to level 20 when I started EQ(I started during Velious era), with many wrong steps, failed experiments(ok, so JC is not a good get rich quick scheme when you are starting out with no money), a couple lost corpses, and so on.  I wonder how far I could get in EQ today in those two months, starting out with nothing more than I had then, except for more knowledge.</p>

<p>SoF sounds like it has alot of promise, but that does not mean much.  I thought OoW sounded terrible, and ended up loving it, I thought DoD sounded like the worst expansion ever, and found it to be one of the best.  I was more excited about PoR than almost any expansion, and now rank it as the worst ever.  TSS was going to be great, and from what I saw in beta, was sure of it, and yet it was a big reason I left EQ.</p>

<p>There are alot of questions...Is there going to be enough content to keep players interested for a year?  Will raiders find challenges outside raids?  Will nonraiders be able to work their way through the tiers of progression, without getting overly frustrated?  Will nonraiders finally have a way to work through the storyline of the expansion?  How long will it take to get the inevitable tuning mistakes fixed(ie, that mission that just about requires a raid geared tank to finish, but is intended for nonraiders and needed for progression)?  Will the insane amount of mudflation add to the game, or detract overall?</p>

<p>With a one year expansion cycle, these questions are pretty key, and the answers will tell alot about how long EQ will remain a success.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on November 11, 2007 08:44 AM</strong></p>
<p>That's a great post, Redhenna. I think you hit the nail on the head. As the industry moves on and MMO FRPG players begin to expect different things, we can't get back to the magic we had when we spent an entire weekend hunting Cockatrices on the north wall of Karnors in the Dreadlands. As the industry has "matured" so have we and we begin to expect new things than we once did. We expect them to solve a way for new players to catch up to old veterans. We expect easy quest systems and dynamic instanced encounters. We expect to never have to camp for any particular item or mob for more than a few minutes. Yet it was some of the pain back then that made the game so magical.</p>

<p>Again, great post. Thank you.</p>
