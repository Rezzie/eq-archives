That would have been cool. But lo and behold, it ain't two more, but <B>eight</B> more. Yep, ye olde banke space will be doubling. That's twice the space for you packrats!<p>You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone in the EQ universe who won't be pleased about having more bank slots. The only issue people seem to have (as with other LoY features) is that some feel such benefits should be freebies given to everyone instead of something you only get by buying the extension.<p>Gimme a break. Every industry in the world, from book publishers to auto manufacturers, charges you for updated and expanded features. Frankly, a one-time $18 charge for doubling your bank space would be worth it on its own, let alone all the other stuff you'll be getting with LoY. Stop super-sizing your value meals for a while and you'll save up those 18 bones in no time, you cheap bastards.<p>By the way, it seems <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4985">LoY will be released on CD</a> as an alternative to downloading it. EBgames will let you preorder a boxed version, though as some people have <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=24340.topic">pointed out</a>, EB will be happy to take a deposit on your unborn children if you let them. Seriously, all it will take is for Rod Humble to say &quot;Sometime down the road when we do EverQuest 3...&quot; for the game to be listed for preorder on the EB site, complete with a price and release date. But in any case, folks on dialup connections will be pleased to have an option other than watching their modems choke on a mess of frog parts.<p><BIG>Lingering Doubts</BIG><p>Last week's patch fixed a number of issues from the previous one, but problems still exist that remain to be addressed. Paladins and other classes are having <a href="http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=17565.topic">problems with Pacify spells</a> that seem either random or based somehow on the level of the caster. Thankfully, since paladins only exist to cast their level 65 Brell's, changes to their pulling abilities are inconsequential.<p>Druids were quick to note <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=30087.topic">changes to healing aggro</a> that were mentioned in the patch message. Examples seem to imply that the change may cause too much aggro in certain situations, though some druids don't seem to have a problem. The aggro change seems largely dependent upon how effective other players are at getting the mob's attention, so the jury is still out on whether this change needs more tuning.<p>Health bars are still a bit bugged, as a player can die and still show a small percentage of health on the screens of group members, but this seems to be a simple graphic glitch as heals are indeed landing properly.<p>Item links are still acting strangely for some people as well. Again, this falls more into the minor annoyance category for most people, but frequent buyers and sellers in the Bazaar have come to rely on links to do business.<p>While the benefits of decreased data bandwidth were welcomed by most players, <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=8864f40f1792ff98f8f24f65117307a5&amp;threadid=5151">not everyone is pleased</a> by the implications of this and other recent game changes. In any case, none of the bugs listed above signal the end of the world, but at least they give players something to complain about until the next patch arrives. <p><BIG>Your Daily Dose of Drama</BIG><p>Remember all the fun we had a couple months back when Monkly Business was sold to that Yantis creep? As with all such hubbub, the noise eventually died down and the monk board has carried on much as it always has. The attempt to set up a rival board pretty much fizzled, and MB remains as convoluted and twink-filled as ever.<p>Proving himself a glutton for punishment, however, Mr. Player Auctions has picked up ownership of a couple other message boards: the Prexus and Luclin communities. This time, however, it seems efforts at resistance are proving a bit more successful. The lion's share of the <a href="http://www.eqluclin.com/">Luclin community</a> has moved to a <a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/beqluclin">new message board</a> that seems to be off to a great start. Similarly, the Prexus folks have <a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/bprexus81531">their own message board</a> free from the <a href="http://pub112.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessage?topicID=20360.topic">selling out</a> of the old board's moderator.<p>Like any good daytime TV show, of course, the <a href="http://www.mysupersalessucks.com/">mudslinging goes both ways</a>. I expect chairs to be thrown across the stage at any moment, along with chants of &quot;You don't KNOW ME! You don't KNOW ME!&quot; from Yantis himself.<p>Not the most compelling batch of news, I will admit. I have been a bit bored lately<a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=292602756">,</a> but as the expansion draws closer I'm sure things will pick up.
