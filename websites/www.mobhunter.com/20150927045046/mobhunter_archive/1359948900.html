To quote my new co-worker Sanya &quot;Tweety&quot; Thomas, &quot;please direct all complaints about me being a sell out corporate whore to www.I Don't See You Paying For My Health Insurance.com.&quot;<p>As part of my new position, since ranting about our competitors would be wildly inappropriate, I'm turning this website over to its other writers.</b><p>His site is in good hands, to be sure. But we'll miss bitter, sharp-witted ol' Lum and his daily doses of vitriol.<p>One thing's for sure: <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/">DAoC</a> will be all the better for it. At least it better be, or we'll be the ones ranting at Lum.
