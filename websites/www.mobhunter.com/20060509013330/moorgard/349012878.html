<html><head><title>One Day Later</title></head><body><h1>One Day Later</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-07-10</p><BIG>Fashionably Late</big><p>Like any snotty debutante, this patch enjoyed keeping us waiting. Let's see what Miss Congeniality has to offer, shall we?<p><B>July 10, 2003<br>------------------------------<p>** Information Gathering **<p>You will soon notice a new dialogue box appear when you log in (it appears after logging in three times to prevent spam for new players).  We are asking you to let us gather a bit of information about your computer that will help us build the future of EverQuest.<p>The important thing here is that you can say no and we won't gather any information.<p>If you do accept, we'll gather CPU, RAM and video card information to help us evaluate and improve EverQuest.  If you agree and then change your mind later, you can disable the feature under the Options tab (Alt-O) and then the General tab in game.<p>So when you see the new dialogue box appear, please read it over carefully and click whichever answer you feel most comfortable with.<p>Thanks.<p>** Zones **<p>- Droga and Nurga moving to Live servers - These zones were revamped and sent to Legends, and now they are moving to the Live servers.  This is a great chance to revisit these zones.<p>- Chardok - Treachery and lies are not uncommon in the court of the Overking.  But there are some unusual rumors being told by some unusual adventurers.  Some say that there is strife within the council of the Overking, and that heroes may find adventure there while that strife lasts.  OOC:  We're introducing a new zone and a new zone type.  The Halls of Betrayal is a &quot;pocket zone&quot;, and new type of zone for EverQuest.  It will exist for a short time to be part of the storyline, and then will be gone.  So if you're going to see it, now is the time.<p>- Grieg's End revamp going to Legends - The redesign includes new encounters, items, traps, and events that make the zone a challenge for the experience group, with plenty of events for a raid group.<p>- Plane of Earth B - we have removed the Call of the Hero restrictions in this zone.<p>- Rallos Zek - the Warlord will now kick anyone out of the zone that is on his hate list and is not in a valid raid greater then 20 people in size.  This should prevent single players being able to attack him and grief other players who are making a valid attempt at him.  This is in addition to the previous limitations of having only one raid allowed to attack him at any given time.<p>- Increased Experience - We have increased the experience modifier in the Tower of Solusek Ro, Halls of Honor, The Temple of Marr, and the Lair of Terris Thule. <p>- Bastion of Thunder - The mini-bosses in Bastion of Thunder no longer spawn immediately after the zone comes up.<p>** Tradeskills **<p>- Tradeskill chance of failures changed - The higher your skill is over the trivial of the combine, the less likely you are to fail with a combine. This is a reduction on the chance to always fail.<p>- Stackable - Ice Burrower Silk, Pie Tins and Muffin Tins are now stackable.<p>** Spells **<p>- New Imbue, Enchant, and Thicken spells - New Imbue, Enchant, and Thicken spells have been added that create five magical items rather than just one.  These spells require five components and take longer to cast and use more mana.<p>- Damage Over Time Spell Foci - Extended Affliction has been changed to Burning Affliction, which causes DoT spells to do more damage instead of having a longer duration.<p>- Enthrall spells - Enthrall spells will not un-stun the target when they wear off if there are other enthrall spells on that target. Also, when an enthrall spell breaks due to damage it will now remove all Enthrall spells, not just the first one it finds.   <p>- Ferocity - We have removed the component requirement for Ferocity.<p>- Kindle - We have added a new Magician spell to the game called Kindle.<p>- Force of Akera - We have added a new Paladin spell to the game called Force of Akera.<p>- Burnout V - this spell should now stack with the Shielding line of spells.<p>- New Spell levels for Clarity line - Boon of the Clear Mind is now a level 44 spell, Clarity II is now a level 52 spell and Gift of Pure Thought is now level 56.<p>- Area of Effect spells - AoE spells that do not affect your group in PvP no longer affect your Raid in PvP either.<p>- Direct Damage spell messages - Striking the killing blow with a direct damage spell will no longer show a double cast on the spell message.<p>- Target Group Buff - TGB will no longer work with any illusions.<p>- Illusion - With Permanent Illusion, Levitation effects will no longer be stripped when zoning and gnome enchanters with a large-size illusion will no longer return to gnome size after zoning.  In general, characters that are under the effect of a size-changing illusion should be seen properly by everyone.<p>- Song Spam - Bards should see less spam when they hit low level PCs with their high level songs.<p>- Treeform - This spell should now work in Luclin outdoor zones.<p>- Draught of Lightning - We have added a new Wizard spell to the game called Draught of Lightning.<p>** Items **<p>- Bards Using Components - Bards using right-click items with a casting time greater than 0 will now expend any required components.<p>- Ornate Armor Molds - These molds are more readily available.<p>- Spellshield - Spellshield items now reduces spell damage by a percentage rather than a fixed amount. <p>- Strikethrough and Stun Resist - You will now receive a message when Strikethrough and Stun Resist work.<p>** Quests **<p>- Newbie Quests - Erudites, Trolls, Ogres and Barbarians now have quests in their newbie areas similar to those implemented for all other races.  This completes the updated newbie quests for all races.<p>- Seana and Stefan Marsinger - These two will be clearer when giving their quest requests, and will return them if you hand them to the wrong Marsinger.<p>- Bors Wharhammer - He will be checking level instead of flags as a requirement for his quests to bring him in-line with the flag removals for the lower tier planes. <p>** Alternate Advancement **<p>- Frenzied Burnout - this ability has been changed to better stack with the Burnout spells.  The attack speed portion of the spell has been reduced in percentage (it hastes the pet much less), but changed to a &quot;bard&quot; haste which will stack with Burnout V.  The strength bonus has also been decreased but made to stack with that of Burnout V.<p>** Skills **<p>- Sneak - Sneak will now work under water.<p>- Instill Doubt - Instill Doubt will now work if the Monk is using his other skills.  Previously, use of other skills such as a kick would cause Instill Doubt to fail.<p>** Interface **<p>- Camera - We have added the ability to bind cameras to keys. This will allow players to hit one key to switch to a desired camera rather than having to cycle through the F9 camera chain.  This can be changed in the Options window (Alt-O) under the Keyboard tab (select &quot;camera&quot; from the list).<p>- Auto-inventory - Items right-clicked off your corpse will now be place into your inventory in the correct order.<p>- Spell Favorites - Creating a spell favorite name that matches a name that already exists will cause the new favorite to be saved over the old (whereas before it would create a second list with the same name).<p>- Random name generator - Asking for a name should no longer result in a name that will be rejected due to duplication.  Note: names can still be rejected by GM's.<p>- Bow Graphics - Bows that have been autoequipped will now display a graphic.<p>- Raids - The creation of a group will now work from inside a raid.<p>- New Filters - We've added a Melee Warnings filter.  It will filter out &quot;cannot see your target&quot; and &quot;cannot hit them from here&quot; messages, along with other such melee warnings.<p>- Spell category lists - We moved a few of the Necromancer spells around on the category lists (from right-clicking spell gems) to make more sense.<p>** Miscellaneous **<p>- Updated character creation descriptions - Right-clicking the class, race or statistic buttons while in the character creation screen will display a detailed explanation of the item clicked.<p>- Clicking on corpses - Right-clicking on a PC corpse other than your own will no longer make a character visible.<p>- Mounts - Fixed a bug with mounts showing up with incorrect Luclin model settings.  Mounts should now only show up when the Luclin models for the character race of the rider AND mounts/elementals are both on.<p>Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we have changed:<p>EQUI_Optionswnd.xml<br>EQUI.xml<br>EQUI_charactercreate.xml</b><p>In addition to all the stuff we expected, there are some interesting surprises.<p>The patch message makes it sound like the pocket zone idea in Chardok is some form of instancing, but Absor <a href="http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=18489.topic&amp;start=33&amp;stop=33">posted on the pally board</a> that this is not the case:<p><B>Nope, it's not an instanced zone. It's a pocket zone, short lived for story purposes. We'll be testing the instancing stuff on a beta server, no Live Alpha Tests, thanks.</b><p>The message doesn't specify whether you need to be friendly with the Sarnaks to enter this new area, but I suspect people will figure that out soon.<p>The exp increase in several PoP zones is nice, and might open things up for a bit of grouping in odd places. It will be interesting to see how this change affects those who still dare to solo in Halls of Honor. I'm a bit surprised that Torment hasn't gotten some love, because mobs still enrage there and the exp sucks. It's a zone that could clearly support several well-defined camps, so it's a shame to have it be completely wasted now.<p>Some decent <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Live&amp;date=2003-07-10%2011:12:44">new spells</a> showed up today. Mages pets get more mana and improved buff stacking, paladins get a new stun, and wizards get a new nuke. Check the Lucy link for a bounty of spell changes, both announced and not.<p>The increase to ornate armor drops is long overdue. I'd venture a guess that nearly every server has far more elemental armor on hand than ornate armor. This gear offers some decent upgrades to the things most non-elemental folks have now, but it isn't so considerable that it will unbalance the game.<p>Other notable changes include messages when those fancy Time gear focus effects kick in, sneak working underwater (grats rogues), and hopefully less chances for raids to bug out. That last one in particular has driven everyone crazy for a while now, so keep your fingers crossed that it actually works as advertised.<p>Finally, what's with the survey about your system details? Well, the devs probably want to know what kind of gear people are running on so they can plan the system requirements for future titles and expansions. It would be great for everyone if EQ didn't have to support anemic hardware like TNT 1 cards. So do us all a favor: if you play EQ on a crappy machine, don't tell them! We don't want to know how you magically got your Voodoo 2 card to work via custom drivers, paperclips, and super glue. Tell them you play on a Radeon 9800 so we can get the system requirements upped already!<p>Okay, so I shouldn't encourage you to lie. Next thing you know, you'll be cheating on your taxes and telling the IRS that I made you do it. So just forget I said anything.<p><B>Update</b> - Turns out there were other problems with the patch, which require a followup, <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=57400">according to Alan</a>:<p><B>All of the recent changes to the keyboard have been an unfortunate side effect of our need to support multiple locales.  Nothing should be visibly different to EQ US customers.  All of what you're seeing are completely unintentional side effects that we're fixing.<p>The three big ones (Shift/Alt, and Slash-Enter to Autorun and the Keypad-slash) will be fixed in a brief update tonight.<p>We'll also be fixing Kindle so that it will scribe into the spellbook properly and we will be adding the deity restrictions to the new &quot;mass&quot; imbue spells.</b><p>Two patches for the price of one! Enjoy, kiddies.<p><BIG>Frog: The Other Other White Meat</big><p>GameSpy has announced that they will be having a series of exclusive interviews with SOE types about the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion. The <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/interviews/july03/ldon1/">first installment</a> is with Absor, and it gives some details about one of the five new areas that lead to the assorted soon-to-be-newly-rediscovered dungeons: Deepest Guk. I would have preferred them to call it Lower Than Lower Guk, but you can't have everything.<p>So the new area is located under Guk and is filled with evil frogloks that have been corrupted by Innoruuk. These new party poopers have vowed to make life miserable for the Marrified froggies who kicked the hapless trolls out of their city in the swamp.<p>Some details:<p><B>Deepest Guk, along with all of the lost dungeons, supports groups of levels 20 to 65. Each theme has a huge range of monsters and adventure types available. The Wayfarers Brotherhood, which is the group that has unearthed information about the possible locations of the lost depths of Guk, offers adventures for any group in that level range. </b><p>It's not entirely clear if the dungeons adjust themselves to the party level or if there are certain ones for various level ranges. As for new items:<p><B>There are all sorts of new loot to be found, some of it in Deepest Guk, and some of it as rewards given by the Wayfarers Brotherhood. The more work you do for them, the more they will like you. Succeed for them enough times and they may allow you to choose a reward from their acquired treasure horde. We're definitely keeping the tradition of discovery and reward alive in this expansion. We know how fun it is to be able to find and earn new treasure.</b><p>We're all glad to hear that there are new loot. (/blink)<p>Personally I was a SolB guy, not a Guk guy. In the old days, being a melee type with no friends and no means of public transportation (as opposed to now, being a melee type with no friends and plenty of public transportation), Guk was too far out of the way to risk a nasty corpse run. Nowadays, though, you can just use a book and end up practically outside the dungeon, so my old fears and abject laziness no longer apply. <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4017&amp;source=Test">Vive la froglok<a/>, I guess. Or, as they say, <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk//article/0,,2-2003310256,00.html?yhnws">it ain't easy being green</a>.<p>The <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/">LDoN site</a> has been updated with more Guk-specific info.<p><BIG>Geekdom is Normal and Healthy</big><p>A <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/07/06/college.gamers.ap/index.html">recent study</a> has declared that being a video game junkie is okay, as long as you can carefully disguise your addiction behind the facade of attending college classes.<p>Not only does frequent video game playing not turn you into a reclusive loner, apparently it actually makes you a social butterfly:<p><B>&quot;There's this stereotype of game slackers wasting time, goofing off, that really isn't valid,&quot; says Marcia Grabowecky, a Northwestern University psychologist who has studied visual perception in humans, including those who play computer and video games.<p>Playing games is so common for this age group, it's almost second nature, Jones says. &quot;It's common maybe in a way Monopoly was years ago,&quot; he says.</b><p>I don't know what kind of Monopoly this guy played, but I'm reasonably certain it didn't involve nearly naked dark elves giving him virtual rub-downs. If it did, then clearly I didn't pay the game enough attention growing up.<p>At least the genre is getting some good press for a change. While the study may not be the most <a href="http://shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html">scholarly</a> in nature, it provides us with an alibi when we get accused of wasting our time behind the keyboard. Unless you live in <a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/latest/story/0,4390,198682,00.html?">Thailand</a>, of course. But then again, someone's always trying to <A HREF="http://pub169.ezboard.com/feqluclinfrm12.showMessage?topicID=1021.topic">push gamers around</a>, so we should be used to it.<p><BIG>Signed, Sigiled, and Delivered</big><p>There are signs of things stirring over at McQuaid &amp; Co.'s new digs. Last week Sigil posted an <A HREF="http://www.sigilgames.com/000068.php">interview</a> with <A HREF="http://www.sigilgames.com/000010.php">Bill Fisher</a>, the company's lead designer. While at Verant/SOE, the Fishmonger worked on several epic quests, plus zones such as Kael Drakkel, Velketor's Labyrinth, Temple of Veeshan, Vex Thal, and the revamped Temple of Cazic Thule. He also worked on EQOA and EQ2 at various points in his career before leaving when Sigil was founded, and was a raid leader and member of some unnamed uberguild in EQ, according to his bio.<p>The questions Bill answered were submitted by readers, and some of them are actually pretty good. When asked about the frequent claims that devs don't understand their own games and how he responds to negative feedback, Fisher responds:<p><B>Developers do play the games they make; we have to know the game. I will note, however, that it's rare to find a developer who has as much time to devote to playing the game as a subset of the player base does.<p>As far as reactions to negative statements, I try to analyze the complaints and determine if there is a real fundamental problem that needs to be addressed. If there is a fundamental problem I attempt to fix it. Analyzing criticism, separating the wheat from the chaff, and applying the knowledge gleaned is important.</b><p>This bit was good too:<p><B>As far as unpopular decisions sometimes those must be made in order to protect the integrity of a game. Contrary to popular myth game developers are not &quot;out to get&quot; the players. If we were, these games would be *considerably* less enjoyable, that I can guarantee. As game developers we must be the stewards of the games we make and carefully watch over them to insure their long term health.</b><p>I'm pretty sure he's wrong. As I recall, all the devs I saw at the SOE offices had horns and carried around little pitchforks, but my memory may be clouded.<p>Anyway, Sigil's <A HREF="http://www.sigilgames.com/forums/index.php?">discussion forums</a> are now open if you want to interact with the folks there. Brad even answers <A HREF="http://www.sigilgames.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=58">posts with a ridiculous amount of questions</a>, so have at him! I need to figure out how to get access so I can ask whether their game will be available for the Atari ST.<p>That's it for today. Not the most <A HREF="http://apnews.myway.com//article/20030708/D7S5GR6O0.html">salacious</a> update, but at least it wasn't a <I>total</i> load of <A HREF="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-376381988">crap</a>.
