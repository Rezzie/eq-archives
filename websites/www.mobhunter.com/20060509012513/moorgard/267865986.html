Do you dare board the ghost ship Deep Tomb for a most perilous ride through the ages? Will you fight back the rising plague of lycanthropy as were-creatures take control of the night? Or simply enjoy the spirit of the ghostly season and partake in a romp of trick-or-treating? Regardless, know ye that the lands of EverQuest will be most perilous, and you shall be taking your life in your hands and must face the consequences if you seek out fame and fortune during this day.</font></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" align="center" valign="top" ><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/images/screenshot2_lg.jpg"><img src="http://everquest.station.sony.com/images/screenshot2.jpg" width="250" height="188" align="left" border="0" alt="View Full Size Image" hspace="10"></a><p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The rumors are spreading.
