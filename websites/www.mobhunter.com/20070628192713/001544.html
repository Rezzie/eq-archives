<h1 class="article_title">The Barriers of Online Gaming</h1>
<p>by Loral on June 24, 2007</p>

<p>Last week I spent a few hours playing the new Shadowrun demo for the Xbox 360. It is a very interesting evolution in first person shooters (FPSs). Rather than the standard run, jump, and shoot we find in most FPS games these days, Shadowrun adds "new verbs" as the marketing guys like to say. You can run, jump, glide, teleport, blast back, see through walls, resurrect, and heal. You can combine magic, technology, and firepower all as fast as you can hit your bumpers and triggers. It's a pretty amazing game but I'm not going to buy it.</p>

<p>It isn't the game itself that steers me away but the knowledge that I am never going to be good enough to compete with those who will have more time, more skill, and more dedication to it than I will have. Shadowrun focuses exclusively on online play and with an online game, there is no option for me to enjoy it in my own way. Other games like Halo 2 at least had a single player campaign but even those disappointed me when I knew how much energy went into the multiplayer portion of that game, a portion I would rarely play and never enjoy.</p>

<p>I've pontificated at great length on the difficulties of the non-raider in Everquest. For six years I played Everquest dozens of hours a week without ever reaching into the depths of Everquest's high-end raid content. Though I spent extensive time in Everquest, I never broke into the inner circles of high-end raiders until recently. Some players in Everquest, and also now in Warcraft, complain about the lack of support for those who have not the time, skill, or dedication to achieve the highest rewards. This problem isn't exclusive to these games. Recently, on the most excellent <a href="http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3?http://zdmedia.vo.llnwd.net/o1/Podcasts/051807.mp3">1UP Yours podcast</a> (43 meg MP3 file link), they discussed the barrier of entry for gamers who want to play competitive online games but cannot break into that circle of hard core elite gamers.</p>

<p>Building quality games for hobbyist gamers is extremely hard to do. Most games either focus on hard core elite gamers or focus on extremely short-duration gaming with little room in between. This has been a problem as long as gaming has existed but as games become more and more social, as more players interact with one another within these games, the problem becomes much more apparent.</p>

<p>Simple solutions cannot solve this problem. Adding features that automatically balance difficulties to even out the battleground will clearly show themselves as artificial. Hard core gamers won't like seeing their power limited and the victories of hobbyist gamers will feel hollow.</p>

<p>Before we dig too deep into this discussion, let us lay out some definitions. </p>

<p>Hard core gamers are gamers who have both the skill and the time to become the elite within any particular game. These are the high-end raiders in massive online games like Everquest and Warcraft. These are the guys who have ten times as many kills as the next highest player in Halo 2. These are the guys who make magic in Shadowrun really look like magic. These are the guys who post Youtube videos of themselves playing Freebird on Expert at 95% in Guitar Hero 2. </p>

<p>It would be easy for us to stereotype hard core players as jobless pimply teens hiding in their mother's basement but we'd be wrong. These can, and often are, adults with jobs and kids who just manage to have the time, skill, and dedication to be one of the best in their chosen battleground. Now that video games have hit an age where adults remember playing them throughout their lives, just about anyone can be a hard core gamer.</p>

<p>We can define casual gamers, a term I myself demanded to be tossed into the fires of the nine hells for its constant misuse, as gamers who play for very short periods of time, have little skill for more complex games, and who care little for the games themselves other than as a way to kill a few minutes. Casual gamers play solitare, they play flash games, and they play freecell when their boss isn't looking. They might play a Nintendo DS once in a while. They're the masses of people who still fawn over the bowling game for their Nintendo Wii. Any gamer who would take the time to read a message forum, read an article, or listen to a podcast about gaming spend very little time considering true casual gamers. We don't even consider them gamers. The marketing groups for the big gaming companies consider them constantly, however. They're building hundreds of new cell phone games a year just for this market.</p>

<p>hobbyist gamers is a new term for me. It defines those gamers who still consider themselves gamers but, either due to a lack of time, a lack of commitment, or a lack of skill, cannot break into the ranks of hard core gamers. Unfortunately for them, however, they know what a hard core gamer is. They know what the hard core gamers possess. These hobbyist gamers are the ones with one, two, or even three level 60 World of Warcraft characters but without a single piece of raid gear. They're the gamers who get destroyed dozens of times in an hour of Halo 2. Their corpses litter the battlegrounds of Azeroth.</p>

<p>hobbyist gamers didn't have much trouble in the past. It might take them twice as long, but on single player games, a hobbyist gamer could still complete it. Only on games with extreme difficulty or extreme time requirements would a hobbyist gamer simply quit. Online, however, these gamers face different problems. Instead of running at their own pace, they are in a race with some of the best and most dedicated gamers in the world. They may have done well against automated opponents but against real players they get destroyed over and over again. They feel as though they will never be as good as the hard core gamers and, when competing with them, either directly in combat or indirectly through content progression, they simply want to quit.</p>

<p>What can game manufacturers do to help? The companies that figure this out stand to make a lot more than the companies that focus on either the hard core or the casual gamers. There are no easy solutions, however. Everything must be carefully balanced. Double experience bonuses, instanced adventures, high-end loot purchasing systems; all of these have helped steer massive online games towards hobbyist gamers. Everquest and World of Warcraft could both reduce the amount of time it takes to complete meaningful group encounters such as the dungeon instances in WoW and the missions in Everquest. </p>

<p>Thirty minutes is all that can be expected when it can, for both of these games, take nearly that long to form a group capable of completing such an event. For player versus player games, there is no clear solution. Ranking systems don't seem to work. Equipment matching doesn't help make up for player experience. Dynamic difficulties are unrewarding for both types of players. Any game that is good enough to get the attention of a hobbyist gamer would likewise get the attention of a hard core gamer so there is no way to focus an entire game directly for hobbyists without also attracting hard core gamers.</p>

<p>The companies that find the right balance stand to make a lot of money. Right now that continues to be primarily single-player games like Zelda Twilight Princess, Crackdown, Grand Theft Auto, and the single player Halo campaigns. The designers of World of Warcraft made some smart decisions early on by keeping leveling fast even when hard core gamers hit maximum character levels in very short periods of time. Games like the multi-player Halo, Shadowrun, Battlefield, and Everquest will continue to reward those who put in the most time, have the most skill, and the highest focus. Many players would say this is as it should be. People trying to sell the games, however, realize the large number of players they're cutting off.</p>

<p>Breaking through the barrier of online gaming for hobbyist gamers is the greatest current challenge of gaming today. There exists a lot of potential for those who seek to break it.</p>

<p>Loral,<br />
Excellent article.  Also, I like the evolution of the site, it feels like a very definative growth process to embrace the MMO industry as a whole, rather than a pidgeon holed EQ only site.  It's good to see evolution and growth.</p>

<p>With regards to the question, 'how to embrace the Hobbiest Gamer', I'd like to toss out a bone to be gnawed on by the EQ developers.</p>

<p>I'd recommend meaningful reward for people to repeat quest driven content in support of other players that have not completed said content.  i.e. give the raiders an incentive to support the hobbiest, thus building new social ties.<br />
Ex. In EQ one of the driving death toll tones ringed out on the forums is the lack of desire on the part of the "haves" those that have completed flagging for places like PoP, OoW, GoD, etc., vs. the need for those same players to participte for the benefit of the "have nots"; those that simply cannot create enough player mass to push through that content block.<br />
Solution: Give "flagged" players a free AA, or somesuch if a person participating in the Raid Group completes a Flag event and becomes Flagged.  One per event.</p>

<p><br />

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Talaen on June 25, 2007 11:01 PM</strong></p>
<p>Well said Loral.  I like your definitions.</p>

<p>There's a few things that I think can help online games specifically remain challenging and depthful while still being games that "hobbyists" can play.</p>

<p>1.  The 90 minute rule.  I've talked about this since LDON hit - simply put, players should be able to play through a session and accomplish something from start to finish in 90 minutes-2 hours.  That includes time for forming groups, etc.  I don't think I need to go too much into why with the audience here at Mobhunter.</p>

<p>2.  Don't give in to instant gratification.  Everyone likes for their accomplishments to have meaning, from the most time-limited hobbyist to the most hardcore gamer out there.  By making the game too easy you only end up allowing people to burn out more quickly.</p>

<p>3.  Don't make raiding the endgame.  The raider/non-raider divide has been around for years, and one of the reasons that it's been such a big topic of discussion is that raids have always been implemented as the endgame.  Even in games that purported to have low and mid-level raiding, it still ended up being 90% endgame raids.  When you got to a certain level, raiding became the point.  Developers need to get away from that model if they want to really reach the broad hobbyist audience.  They need to say "here's our cool adventure game that anyone can do, and it has meaningful solo, group and raid content at all levels."</p>

<p>4.  Think outside the box.  Let's face it.  EQ was a graphical DikuMUD clone.  WoW, for all it gets bandied about, was an EQ/DAoC clone for the most part.  All the fantasy games are pretty much still building on the same DikuMUD platform.  While this has worked for the past ten years, now players have options, and they have more options every year.  If designers want to keep people playing their game, they need to start thinking of how to set their games apart from the crowd.  Players, especially the "hobbyist" gamers who don't really get to "finish" the current games they're playing, are going to be more likely to jump to your new game if you've done something relatively unique with it, and I don't mean licensing their favorite tabletop miniatures setting either.</p>

<p>5.  Don't forget the intangibles.  It's easy to think that players just care about levels and loot.  But it's wrong.  Players like a lot of things - they like social interaction, even if they don't act like it sometimes.  They like it when the game lets them throw parties and decorate houses and sit in chairs.  They like lore, and reading about the story of your game world.  They like making cool things, and that doesn't always mean a sharper sword or shinier suit of armor.  They like interacting with NPCs and we're not talking about "kill ten rats" questing here either, but being able to do things like ally yourself with the guards in town so that you can have them look the other way when you sneak into the baron's mansion to play robin hood with his gold.  If a developer wants their game to really have lasting appeal with the "hobbyist" crowd, they need to pay attention to all of these facets as well.</p>

<p>Those are my thoughts.</p>

<p>Nice definitiosn EXCEPT elite hardcore players in Everquest do NOT have to be raiders.  For many its simply a choice of game play style.  </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Redhenna on June 26, 2007 12:38 AM</strong></p>
<p>Interesting article Loral, and great comments Talaen.  </p>

<p>I have been playing Eve Online for the last 6 months, and find that it has some interesting answers to the problem.  Eve's skill system has skill training taking just time, but skills train whether online or offline, so that playtime has no effect on your skill progression.  Further, higher levels of skills take much longer than lower levels, but each level grants the same bonus, so you can get to close to long time player power fairly quickly.</p>

<p>Eve also has nothing like nodrop...if you have the skill prerequisites, you can use an item, no exceptions.  This gives multiple routes to improved modules/ships...you can get them as drops, buy them, or in some cases make them.</p>

<p>While, in fact, Eve is not the most friendly game for nonhardcore gamers, but does have some somewhat unique ideas that allow for those hobby gamers to at least not be forever behind the curve.</p>

<p>One of the hardest things for games is how to appeal to hobby gamers, players with more time but lack of interest in large operations(raids), and those hardcore raider types.  I am not even sure if it is possible.  It might be best for games to specialize, but that has real problems too, eg in EQ, many more hardcore raiders came from originally nonhardcore players.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: matt on June 26, 2007 08:10 AM</strong></p>
<p>Thats a great article sir. I absolutely agree with you. </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: kiztent on June 26, 2007 08:40 AM</strong></p>
<p>The thing you miss is the multiplication of rewards gained by the hardcore players.  Not only do they have better reactions (in the sense of doing the right thing to win), but they have more time with their teams (which matters in battlegrounds).</p>

<p>Plus, of course, they have better gear.  Because, you know, those advantages aren't enough.</p>

<p>The hobbyist needs to get over their need to compete with the hardcore player, and the developers need to stop rewarding hardcore players with better loot - at least if there's any meaningful PvP or rewards out of line with risk.  EQ was notoriously bad at this with, especially with PoP - quad kiting in HoH versus farming Seb, how does the exp/hour match up?</p>

<p>I'd recommend for the fix that the raid mobs drop swords/armour/stuff with exactly the same stats as the noob gear and that they add nifty titles and increase the detail and particle effects on  the loot.</p>

<p>Those who still wish to be first to a kill will be, but they won't get the ADDITIONAL advantage of better loot.</p>

<p>Loral,</p>

<p>   While I did enjoy this article, I find that you are more and more steering away from EverQuest centered material... this makes me sad as a long time mobhunter reader.  </p>

<p>  But as far as the topic goes, I think they need to add a field of research just to set up a gamer niche system.  I know that I've been a hardcore uber raider in EQ for a long time... and I also know that is how I've always played any game I play.  But my roomate, bless his heart, is a total casual... infact I was laughing out loud at work as I read your article because you basically peg'd our styles of gaming. </p>

<p>One with the desire and passion to dominate a game, and one with barely enjoy attention span to even beat the first few levels of any game.   </p>

<p>It really comes down to a personal/moralistic view of the hobby... when does gaming go from a hobby to an alternative life style?</p>

<p>That's what I want to know, and further more, if more people know a person's character than know a person's real name... who is the dominate form of life?</p>

<p>I guess the more you research gaming personalities the more you find the oddities of gaming culture (and it had been this way for all of man's evolution in theory).</p>

<p>Anywas, good artcile Loral... wish I'd see you steer back into EverQuest more!</p>

<p>What's interesting is that in Everquest, how "hard core" you are is almost purely about time available to play, and not really much about skill at all. Take anyone, have them have the time to raid 45 hours a week, have them pick a needed class, and I guarantee they can get into one of the top guilds on the server easily and quickly presuming they aren't braindead.</p>

<p>It is completely unlike a game like Halo, where it really is about skill.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Krozana on June 26, 2007 11:47 AM</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for finally giving me a name.    I've hated the term casual gamer, because as someone who when I am actively playing a game, plays for 20-30 hours a week if not more, I felt I was anything but casual, but being one who liked to do my own thing for most of my time and not join the 'hardcore' raiders I didn't want that moniker either.    Hobbist gamer is a great title :)</p>

<p>Thanks for a great article as well, nice as someone else said to see Mobhunter branching out a bit these days</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: barrant on June 27, 2007 04:12 AM</strong></p>
<p>I agree with Bim here.  EQ hardcore is all about investing time in the game, not skill.  I've been hardcore, casual, and "hobbyist" in EQ at various points over the past several years, and quite frankly, a trained monkey could perform very well in high level raids.  EQ isn't this remarkably challenging event as many would have you believe, it's just time consuming entertainment.  </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Sunshadow on June 27, 2007 08:48 PM</strong></p>
<p>I hate how the current mission times are mostly over an hour(all the way up to 3hours). I would like to see a lot more built around the models used in the MPG group trials. At the time they were short, hard and fun.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Shadowpro of Old on June 27, 2007 10:59 PM</strong></p>
<p>Loral,<br />
I appreciate your posts on EQ, they are like "the Patch" for an old overcome EQ addiction...</p>

<p>Anyways, I think that the way to make the Hobbyist gamer feel valuable is to have much more potential for random discovery in game.  Players, low level or high, should have the ability to discover or craft a weapon, magic item or jewel that sets them apart from the rest of the population.  (Bilbo, finds the ring and instantly he is a much more powerful dude.) These discoveries could provide great wealth or power to a small percentage of the virtual world.</p>

<p>I compare it to the guy who discovers a great invention, patents the idea, and makes millions off of the discovery...rags to riches.</p>

<p>Ideas like this could be infused into the lore of the game.  While the uber gamers are out earning their keep in places of uber-loot (which they rightfully earn) the hobbyist could be following a questing path which might lead to a great discovery.  Let some of the quests be available only once to the person that picks up the trail. eg. A person finds an old note which begins a quest.  If the quest goes unresolved for x amount of days, the note falls to the ground for the next inquisitive player (regardless of level) to begin.  Now that's a quest.  No spoiler site to dumb down the ride.  Let the final result be a complete surprise each and every time.</p>

<p>Lastly, I think that it wouldn't hurt to place some random items around the world in obscure places.  I was the guy who would run, jump & swim to the most obscure places, just to see what would happen and what was there.  How about a random Wurmslayer (now that dates me) at the bottom of that lake, on top of the rock?</p>

<p>My 2 cents... </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Bim on June 28, 2007 09:43 AM</strong></p>
<p>The problem with one shot quests is that they would entail a significant amount of development work for content that would only be appreciated by one person. Simply not cost effective or realistic.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Skuz Bukit on June 28, 2007 09:49 AM</strong></p>
<p>Very good article & whilst some might not see it is relevant to Everquest it very much is, I see, hear & interact with players that fall into your "Hobbyist" gamer definition on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Soon as I read your article I got a few ideas that could be implimented to help create a place for these players within current games, a fps & a mmorpg are the 2 i think can easiest be helped.</p>

<p>FPS:<br />
League tables, with an award for those at the top of their league table each month, pvp is by necessity a test of the best but having the best rack up kills versus people nowhere near their skill level, they get artificially inflated scores, (something wow adressed partially by way of their honour system)a system to filter better players into a different battle ground so that eventually you have the best competing with the best & the worst competing with the worst.</p>

<p>RPG:<br />
MMORPG for everquest the raid guilds at the high end are indeed difficult to enter & stay in if you cannot commit at that level, there are mid tier guilds etc, but the problem partialy lies with how the progression is on a raid aspect, typically you are expected to progress through older raids to gear up to a level competent to tackle newer or more recent content.</p>

<p>There is plenty of room to add mid tier content each expansion that sits at a reward level of past content (giving them another target to hit) that would not be appealing to the very high end (so the people actually beating it would gain a sense of beating something first).<br />
A serverwide "who killed what when" chart accompanied by some kind of league table has been player-organised for the conent for a while  but there's not a real league-table system so it's hard to have any competition unless at the very top, a league table that also took such mid-tier content added in each new expansion might hold more sense of achievement for the "hobbyist" level players that can handle the requirements of less than top-end guilds.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: wormy on June 28, 2007 02:10 PM</strong></p>
<p>Excellent article Loral!</p>

<p>To move away from a (single) game centric site to a broader scope (online gaming at all) is the way to go.</p>

<p>On topic:<br />
to attract and keep(!) hobbyist gamers, there need to be some sacrifices: the hard core gamers.<br />
They will come, run throught the game, will be bored and will leave - what stays are the hobbyists. It's a hard road for a publisher, because the hard cores will cry aloud and may keep other players away. But in the long run, the game will be a healthy one.</p>

<p>Long and rewarding quest series, some random encounters (even non-repeatable ones), lots of titles and fancy items to show off *g* - a big world with lots of things to discover, fight and build. Keep the focus on PvE - too much PvP will create greed (that's where the time/skill problems will surface brutally).<br />
