Over at the Safehouse, <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=22881.topic">clues</a> are surfacing. Let's follow the trail...<p>1. In the first <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/eqlive/indev.jsp">State of the Game</a> message, in the part that talks about upcoming high-level content, a hidden link turned up in the phrase &quot;begun a great task&quot; that leads to an interesting Web site called <a href="http://www.planesofpower.com/">Planes of Power</a>. Um, that's a cool picture.<p>2. Nathan Pearce, Director of Web Presence for SoE, <a href="http://www.deepfriedcomics.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3572">posted a picture</a> of his office to show a /GU comic he put on his door. On one of the three monitors on his desk, Nathan was displaying a picture of the same guy from the Planes of Power site. When asked about it, he said &quot;You'll find out on Friday.&quot;<p>3. Some new <a href="http://www.keithparkinson.com/">Keith Parkinson</a> (the guy who does the box art for EQ) artwork is making the rounds. One <a href="http://www.keithparkinson.com/new/pics/POPcover_sm.jpg">picture</a> in particular catches the eye. Notice the name of the picture: it screams &quot;Planes of Power cover.&quot;<p>The evidence is pretty clear. This expansion, aimed at high-level folks, will center around a collection of new planes--culminating, perhaps, in the Plane of Power itself (Rallos Zek's stomping ground). Hey, we've been saying since Luclin came out that Verant pretty much <I>had</I> to do another expansion of high-end content.<p>Should Verant be working on another expansion when the last one still has so many--uh--lingering issues? Well, I'd expect the answer you would get from them is &quot;there are two entirely different teams handling those assignments.&quot; And honestly, high-level content is very much needed at this juncture in the game. So while the Luclin engine and vast amounts of old content are in need of tuning, the need for new loot to farm overpowers us all.<p>The clock is ticking closer to Friday...<p><BIG>Don't Horse Around with the GM</BIG><p>I have been getting e-mail after e-mail asking that we mention this story, so I'll finally relent. (The original link is <a href="http://www.conard.net/pictures/eq/banned/banned.htm">here</a>, by the way, though the site is exceeding its bandwidth limitations.)<p>It seems that during one of those recent melee matches in the Arena, a paladin named Hwedung used his holy steed and was <a href="http://pub63.ezboard.com/fbrellrantsfrm2.showMessage?topicID=3251.topic">threatened with a banning</a>. Turns out GM Kriggan, the person in charge of the whole thing, didn't have horse models on and so thought that the pally had illegally modified his run speed. A huge debate ensued, and eventually Hwedung proved that he was right, even though the GM made the old &quot;well you might be right, but we aren't saying we believe you&quot; response.<p>Some people are making this out to be the worst example of GM abuse ever. Sorry, I've seen worse. Honestly, while the GM was clearly wrong and jumped to a stupid conclusion, it didn't really seem that malicious. Would I have been pissed if this had happened to me? Oh yeah. And I certainly can't blame Hwedung for being righteously angry and threatening to quit the game--I'd be tempted to do so in his shoes, too. But many of the people making such an uproar about this situation are just using it to advance their own agendas. Thanks, but we'll pass on that bandwagon.<p><BIG>More Maps, Man</BIG><p>Muse over at <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com">EQ Atlas</a> has finished his collection of outdoor maps with <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/westernwastes.html">Western Wastes</a>, <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/maidenseye.html">Maidens Eye</a>, and <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/umbralplains.html">Umbral Planes</a>. Nice job. Now Muse is all set to map the Planes of Power for us...
