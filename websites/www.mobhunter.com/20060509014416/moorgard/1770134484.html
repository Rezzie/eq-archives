The estimated downtime is 5 hours.</B><p>Well, it's about time. The longer the servers are up, the more jittery they get, and while many servers had some unexpected crashes and such during the last few weeks, it's been a while since we've had a proper downtime.<p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">Caster's Realm</a> asked Absor if the patch would include the debut of the new User Interface and Bazaar code:<p><B>Yes - As a part of the rollout for the new interface, Beta Two of the new UI and the Bazaar will begin on the Live servers as of the next patch.<p>It's had an excellent few weeks overall on the Test Server and we'll be running it on the Live servers in an optional mode until we're satisfied with it. We'll give details about how to turn these options on in the patch message. <p>- Alan</B><p>Which confirms our original intelligence that told us this stuff was slated to go live in mid-July.<p>It's interesting to note that these functions will be in &quot;optional&quot; mode for a while, and that this is &quot;Beta Two&quot; of the code. Verant is hedging its bets. That way, if things don't work, they can always just say, &quot;Hey, we told you it was a beta!&quot; And if it does work, then Hartsman's boys can shout how much their beta r0xx0rs.<p>I can't wait until I can enter the Beta Two phase of Planes of Power when I buy it on October 22.<p><BIG>Digging the Denmother</BIG><p>So someone at Verant decided to send Mennix (of &quot;<a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dear_mennix.jsp">Dear Mennix</a>&quot; fame) on the road and have him interview various people who run EQ-related Web sites. The halfling's first victim is <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/articles.jsp?id=49593">Niami</a>, Denmother of <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/">EQ Traders</a>.<p>Niami's site is already a vast wealth of trade skill information, but promises to become even more useful thanks to this nugget revealed in her interview:<p><B>Sometime in the next couple of months, we hope to take the &quot;next step&quot; and launch a massive searchable database that will allow folks to search for supplies, recipes, drop and trivial information, etc. It's a rather large undertaking, but we've got some wonderful volunteers helping, not only with the data entry, but also with brainstorming the database design, edit and query functions, etc.</B><p>Sounds terrific. With all the recent trade skill recipe additions, a database like this would be a huge timesaver.<p>Jeez, Niami is such a VAK for submitting to an interview like this. I mean, how big a kiss-ass do you have to be to let Mennix profile you? Niami must want a job at Verant really, really badly! VAK VAK VAK!!!<p>Yeah, that means a Moorgard interview is on the way. Just thought I'd give you a chance to get those flamethrowers ready.<p><BIG>Druids on the Head of a Pin</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm30.showMessage?topicID=13.topic">posted</a> over on the Druid's Grove about the removal of the healing penalty that Csenicier told you about the other day:<p><B>With the next patch to Test we will be removing the 10% penalty to healing from non-clerics. Clerics will still get the 5% bonus at all levels, and will still get their heal spells many levels earlier that the other priests.<p>We want to see how this plays out on Test, obviously, before we consider moving it Live, and before we consider other changes to the priest classes. This is the Test server, so you should neither expect the change to go Live, nor assume that it won't. Right now it's there to be tested, and whether it does or does not go Live will be dependent on what we discover on Test.<p>We are also looking at some changes to help to make clerics be a little more well-rounded, along with addressing some concerns put forth by druids and shamans. Those ideas are still in the development stage, and we'll talk more about them when we get done looking at the healing changes.</B><p>Is this change a good thing? Sure, everybody likes to be healed, and that 10% isn't an unbalancing amount. Besides druids and shamans, who benefits? Guilds that have a well-rounded makeup, really. That is, those that didn't get sucked into the &quot;recruit only clerics/warriors/rogues&quot; mentality which ran rampant for so long.<p>What changes will help clerics be more well-rounded? They already demand primal in Sleeper's Tomb and get some pretty slick weapons in Luclin. Pretty soon they're going to stop healing altogether!<p>Well, I guess that's one way of getting rid of complete heal...
