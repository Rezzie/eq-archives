The game will consist of packaged software and a subscription-based online service.<br>...<br>The current &quot;EverQuest&quot; &quot;is really a PC-centric experience where you're typing a lot of stuff,&quot; said IDC analyst Schelley Olhava. &quot;They're going to have to find a way to translate that to the console.&quot;<p>Scott McDaniel, vice president of marketing for Sony Online Entertainment, said the new version of &quot;EverQuest&quot; will be a fresh design optimized for console play. Chat components will be offered through a variety of peripherals, plus pre-set menus of common phrases. <p>&quot;It's going to work in a similar manner (to the PC game,) but its very much a streamlined interface and to a degree streamlined game play,&quot; he said. &quot;We're making sure it's very easy to get into it and start doing things quickly.&quot;</B><p>You'll have to wait for the offical &quot;golden time&quot; of noon Pacific to find out the rest of the details. Why would we hold back, since the story has essentially been broken anyway? Because we said we would, that's why. Hey, we like to pretend we have a <I>little</I> integrity around here... at least some of the time.<p>Hey! Stop giggling!<p>Oh, and keep in mind that &quot;EverQuest Online Adventure&quot; is a separate product from EverQuest--in other words, you won't be using your PS2 to powerlevel a toon on your PC.<p>Tune in at <B>noon Pacific</B> for the rest of this story.<p><B>Edit:</B> Well, since every other site seems to be breaking this story, we might as well, too. That integrity thing is overrated. We'll post the full details shortly.<p><BIG>Even More Cloak and Dagger (Minus the Dagger)</BIG><p>Absor was back today, <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000535.html">responding</a> to a couple questions from a player regarding the current state of the Luclin engine. We'll paraphrase the questions and give you Absor's actual answers:<p><I>Hey Absor, I just spent $1500 upgrading my PC so I can play Luclin, and I was wondering something. When is that Umbra thing is gonna be in the game so I get the kickass performance I've been waiting for?</I><p><B>Well, Umbra is in and working. It was never supposed to be anything that made a visible change, it just makes it so that the millions of polys in the game get rendered less frequently.</B><p><I>Uh, okay. By the way, when is my character's cloak gonna be visible? I just ninjalooted a CoF from a Naggy raid (dumb n00bs) and can't wait for my level 14 monk to be sporting a fancy red cloak!</I><p><B>Cloaks were an idea we wanted to add, but were always on the list of items to be cut first if they proved too problematic. We were pretty clear about cloaks not making the cut a while before Shadows of Luclin shipped. I suspect most people saw the first Firiona Vie model and assumed that because she was wearing a cloak that they were in for sure. But that model was just a test run, done early in production. We improved the models significantly after that. But cloaks were always a feature that we expected to drop. Implementing them properly would have made the character files a lot bigger than they are now, and that just didn't seem like a good idea.<p>Alan</B><p>Personally, I'm very, very happy there aren't any visible cloaks in the game. Some classes (like monks, which is the only class that matters, really) would look silly with a cape. Yeah, yeah, plate classes and rogues want them. Boo-hoo. Think of the monks!<p>That's about all the news we have for you right now. I'm sure there's <a href="http://newtown.hi-ho.ne.jp/raibo/raidersei/image/agency/cm/fuyu.swf">more</a> we could dig up, but you probably <a href="http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/record/02rs/HR256.htm">wouldn't believe it</a> anyway. So, let's quit while we're ahead. Sorta.
