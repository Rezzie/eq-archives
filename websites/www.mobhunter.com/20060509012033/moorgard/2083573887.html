Necros want this spell to overwrite liche form, but it currently doesn't because of a conflict in the way &quot;change form&quot; spells work:<p><B>We understood the request that it overwrite Lich. As I said, we'll have to look into that later as it would require an exception in code for this spell, not just a change to the spells themselves (I suspect that didn't make as much sense as I think...). Basically, you're asking for a single spell to be exempt from the existing rule system for all spells, and that would require some code to be written for that spell, not just a change in the spell database. That won't happen right now, our programmers are very busy. And before making any exception to any rule we'd want to look at it with a bit of care.</B><p>Since none of us has seen the actual code for EverQuest and lived to tell about it, we really don't know how complex such a change would be to implement. With all due respect to necros, we'd rather Luclin be made ship-shape than have custom coding done that affects only a couple spells. In the meantime, necros will continue to <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forumsnew/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=7795&amp;FORUM_ID=1&amp;CAT_ID=1&amp;Topic_Title=Quivering+Veil+of+Xarn%2E%2E%2E&amp;Forum_Title=General+Discussions">grouse</a> about the issue.<p><B>Camping for XP</B><p>Windows XP is available for retail sale as of yesterday. EQ players want to know if their beloved virtual world will run well under Microsoft's new standard operating system, and of course Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000363.html">confirmed</a> that Verant intends to support the platform. But Alan mentioned something we found interesting:<p><B>Obviously with it's release being so recent we haven't had any real opportunities to fiddle around with it and do any serious testing.</B><p>So no one at Verant was in the XP beta test? Microsoft didn't try to ensure that a piece of software used by half a million potential customers would work smoothly on their new flagship product? Sounds a bit fishy to me.<p><B>It's Hard to be Employed by a Goddess Who Just Got Whacked by Afterlife</B><p>Tunare has apparently <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000365.html">released</a> senior events master Lady Daegarmo from indentured servitude, marking the return of the once and future mistress of the Best of the Best and Test of Tactics tournaments. Read the nice roleplay post if you like, or just prepare to compete once again for your server's title.<p><B>FanFaire Redux, Halfling Style</B><p>Absor posted a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000364.html">link</a> to Mennix's <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/en/report_orlando.jsp">recap</a> of the Orlando FanFaire.<p>I swear to you, if prohibition is ever put into effect again, FanFaire will be about 20 minutes long. Seriously, FanFaire is like a frat party for your liver.<p><B>If It Moves, Kill It</B><p>In the promised <a href="http://slownewsday.net/story.php?story=73">Abashi-ism</a>, Gordon returns once again to Ester's broken-quest thread. He <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000358.html">discusses</a> just how rare Timbur the Tiny, a named giant in North Karana, really is:<p><B>To give you an idea, were you to kill his placeholder (one of about 15 different unrelated npcs) the second it spawned, you'd probably see about 1 Timbur per month.</B><p>Makes you shudder a bit, no? Now you have an understanding as to how some quest mobs are designed to work. While some mobs have a single, static placeholder, others require a whole zone to be hunted in order to see a rare spawn in a timely fashion. It's like the difference between hunting the Ancient Cyclops in the Ocean of Tears versus the free-for-all of South Ro. The latter requires a complex series of triggers and rare spawns to be cycled through before you get the mob you want.<p>Okay, that's all of an update I can manage before my tongue turns into sandpaper. Did I mention that I can't stand coconut?
