<html><head><title>Thank You, DAoC... Thank You!</title></head><body><h1>Thank You, DAoC... Thank You!</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-10-06</p>Abashi posted a lengthy <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000340.html">document</a> authored mostly by a designer called Rich Waters. This message confirms that the melee changes will go live with Monday's patch, and details exactly what changes will be made. Read the whole thing on Dev Corner, but highlights are listed below.<p><B>2-Handed Weapons</B> - Significant damage bonus increase; damage bonus listed on item stats; post-epic weapons (priceless, primal, maybe others) receive stat upgrades.<p><B>Warriors</B> - Taunt cap raised to 230 at 60th; epic blades usable in either hand.<p><B>Rogues</B> - Post-epic piercers upgraded; new piercers added from 51-60.<p><B>Monks</B> - Exclusive higher damage table; triple attack at 60; minimum damage for flying kick at 51-60; new blunt weapons from 51-60.<p><B>Rangers</B> - Double attack cap raised to 245; innate offensive bonus at 55-60; defense cap raised to 230 at 60th; riposte cap raised.<p><B>Paladins/SKs</B> - Moved to warrior damage table; 1H weapon/shield combos upgraded, new weapons added; taunt cap raised to 220.<p><B>Bards</B> - Offense cap raised to 252 at 60th; weapon skill caps raised; moved to warrior damage table; epic sword equipable in either hand.<p><B>Surprise Change to the Magic System</B><p>This is a big one. The high-end game will be seeing some major changes in the way encounters work with regards to spells landing on mobs:<p><B>Through our testing we found that many higher level creatures, and especially those creatures that are above 60th level, were typically resisting magical damage to an extent far greater than they should have been. This lead to a couple of classes having their usefulness in these situations either negated or reduced to a pure utility role. As such we've made the following changes:<p>NPCs now have less of a chance to resist any direct damage spell caused by casters above level 50. Super-high level NPCs have received a large reduction in the level-difference bonus they receive to their resists based upon the level of the attacking player character. We've increased the effectiveness of resist debuffs against a large number of higher level NPCs in regard to damage spells being cast upon them. We've also reduced the resistances on a wide range of NPCs, especially for NPCs in Velious. Finally, we've given our designers more control over the ability to customize any particular encounter. For example previously, if a designer didn't want a creature to be mesmerisable, he had to give it high magic resistance. Now they can set that feature individually while keeping magic resists reasonable so they don't take a bunch of classes out of the picture through the need for one feature.<p>Players will now also receive messages when an NPC is immune to a particular type of spell, much like messages regarding mesmerization have always been sent. We can do this since the designers have direct control over the effectiveness of certain utility effects, while still allowing damage-causing spells to go through. As an example, NPCs that were always immune to melee-speed debuffs by virtue of the fact that they had a very high magic resistance will still be immune to those spells, but magic-based spells that cause damage or do some other effect that the designer didn't necessarily want to rule out would now go through.</B><p>Okay, I'm a meat shield, not a caster, but you don't have to be Merlin to see what an important, even startling change this could be.<p>We'll have to wait until the changes are live to see what <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=2613.topic">mages</a>, <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forumsnew/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=7481&amp;FORUM_ID=1&amp;CAT_ID=1&amp;Topic_Title=Changes+MONDAY%21&amp;Forum_Title=General+Discussions">necros</a>, <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=9a9afe2565a4c72f4dbebb89788eeca2&amp;threadid=16856">shamans</a>, <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=25736.topic">druids</a>, and other casters think of them. Rest assured that they will be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism, given the near siege mentality that many EQ casters have adopted over the last couple years.<p>Of course, there is a caveat to these magic changes:<p><B>Finally, to compensate for increased magical damage, some NPCs have received additional abilities and/or stats. This serves to keep the encounters at a similar level of difficulty while balancing the contribution of melee and casters, rather than engaging exclusively in the melee-heavy strategy of before.</B><p>Remember, Verant's goal with these changes was not to make the game <I>easier</I>, but to make it more <I>balanced</I> and fun for a wider range of classes. Let's be honest--the classes having the most fun in the high-end game are the ones that are the most desired: warriors, rogues, clerics, and wizards. Increasing the abilities of the other classes is excellent, but doing so without balancing mob capabilites would make certain epic encounters trivial. Some mobs are going to be upgraded to compensate for that.<p>We may bitch a bit when Vindicator equips six weapons, death touches, and pisses fireballs down onto us, but if necros and mages can land damage spells against him and his uber kinsmen, a little extra work to modify our strategies will be worth it.<p>These changes are intended to make players feel good about their characters. On paper, this patch will accomplish that--in spades. Let's hope that it fares as well in practice.<p>Let the log parsing begin!
