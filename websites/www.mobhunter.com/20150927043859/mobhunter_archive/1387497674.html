This format still exists today within EverQuest, as exemplified by warriors, wizards, and clerics. All other classes are some offshoot or combination of the three core characters.<p>With choice, though, come questions of balance. If a druid is part cleric and part wizard, how much of each can the druid be without becoming more powerful than the parent classes? Conversely, how little of each can the druid possess before becoming marginalized and useless?<p>These are the questions that face EverQuest today.<p>In a recent post about <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=51358">the nature of the Test server</a>, Rich Waters summed things up pretty well:<p><B>The game has grown and shifted enormously from when it was initially released, and the role of each class has changed in many ways. Some classes have worked out fairly well, some have seen significant changes in the past, and certainly a few need some meaningful alterations to fit into present-day EverQuest. We're well aware that not all classes have grown equally over time. When the game was originally designed, no classes needed to have things like a defining raid role, as frequent raiding simply didn't exist in the original view of the game. Over time, many new factors have popped up and were retroactively squeezed into class balance, with varying degrees of success.</B><p>The points Rich makes are true of all classes, not just healers. One need only look to the rogue for an example. Since the original vision of a stealthy, trap-disarming scout didn't work, Verant compensated by giving the class ultra-high damage output. This skewed melee classes completely, and wasn't addressed much at all until the great melee balancing of a year or so ago. And, of course, the debate about just how balanced melee classes are still rages on.<p>At any rate, today the focus shifts to one class in particular: clerics. With new druid and shaman heals on Test server, clerics everywhere wanted to know what they would get in order to become more balanced. After all, exp groups would be much better off with a druid or shaman, and both of those classes can already solo far more efficiently than the cleric. Rich Waters stopped off at the cleric board to address this issue and and reveal <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=f880d4495f4adcb56a268b7170c28c8e&amp;threadid=11173">the new vision of the cleric class</a>:<p><B>- Provide clerics with useful group and raid roles as other priests gain raid quality healing <br>- Decrease the cleric's mandatory dependency on grouping for any reasonable gain <br>- Increase the level of variety and interest involved in playing a cleric</B><p>To accomplish these goals, the cleric class is undergoing some major changes. Sure, there are a few new healing spells, but the real upgrades are coming in other forms. A summoned hammer with considerable procs, a new yaulp that adds haste and mana regen, improvements to that goofy cleric pet, and the addition of the bash skill.<p>Waters says that internal testing has provided amazingly powerful results:<p><B>Using a combination of these spells, along with the clerics excellent buffs give surprisingly good results. In testing, clerics have been effective soloing the entrance to Charasis and Chardok, grouping in a number of high end dungeons, and even making reasonable experience as a two-cleric duo in Cazic-Thule.</B><p>If you read some of the lengthy discussion happening on the cleric boards, you see a lot of negativity towards these proposed changes. But look at the evidence Waters presents... a cleric duo getting exp in the new Cazic-Thule? In case you weren't aware, it's not like any two random level 60 people can waltz into this zone and duo--aside from maybe one spot in the whole dungeon, pretty much only a really uberfied shaman/monk team has a prayer with even the easier mobs. Two clerics being able to exp there raises the question as to whether clerics will become <I>too</I> powerful with these new changes.<p>A lot of clerics seem to be uncomfortable with the idea of becoming melee oriented when soloing and in groups. While the idea of a battle cleric is an old D&amp;D staple, many EQ clerics would rather see expanded nukes, DoT spells, or abilities that the other priest classes get. But if you stop to think about it for a moment, increasing the melee effectiveness of the cleric is really the way to go.<p>Why? Because giving clerics the type of nukes or DoTs that would make them happy would fundamentally change the class's role on raids. Right now, clerics are the cornerstone of healing on any high-end encounter, and while the new druid and shaman healing spells will help those classes find more of a role on raids, neither one of them will be challenging the cleric for healing when facing the Avatar of War, for example. But giving the cleric class raid-quality nukes would make the class far too diversified. As an archetypal class, clerics--like warriors and wizards--should have a more narrow focus in their abilities. The proposed cleric changes add a new dimension to the class without taking away its primary focus.<p>Ah, but why do druids and shamans get such massive spell upgrades then? Because druids lacked a major role on high-end mobs. Sure, they do great as spot healers, filling in the gaps between complete heals, and they might toss in some nukes now and then to help damage the mob, but largely the class had to wing it and fit in wherever needed. The new healing spells gives them a more definite focus without taking away the class's versatility. In the case of shamans, who already have raid-defined roles, the new healing spell (which does less than the druid's version, and rightfully so) once again adds versatility. The shaman's role on raids is dependent upon the possession of several spells, including Malo and Torpor--spells that are notoriously hard to obtain. Giving the shamans a heal of around 2K hitpoints allows shamans without those class-defining spells to have a worthy role against high-end mobs without fundamentally changing the way the class works.<p>So where do these changes leave paladins? This class is a hybrid of warriors and clerics, after all, and increasing the group and solo abilities of clerics would seem to infringe on the pally's role. For their part, most paladins <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=16346.topic">aren't worried</a> about the changes. They seem to feel balanced and largely happy with the role of off-tank and backup healer on raids, but I wonder if that will hold true when they try to get exp groups after these changes take place. I'm also very curious whether two paladins could duo mobs in the new Cazic-Thule.<p>Ultimately, I don't think these changes will ruin the game for anyone. The changes to the three priest types are all about making these classes feel wanted and needed. Clerics have a clear raid role, druids have a versatility in groups, and shamans fit both those roles if they have the right tools. The new spells assure both group-level and raid-level abilities for all, as well as adding a soloing option to clerics--the only priest that can't do so effectively today. The proposed cleric changes are the only route Verant could take without completely changing--or adding too much versatility to--the class that is already the cornerstone of healing. The new EQ battle cleric gives the class more options without adding to MUDflation. And that's a good thing.<p>So no, these changes don't mean the fall of Rome. But the Colosseum was due for a little redecorating, anyway.
