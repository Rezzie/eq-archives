She has been gone now for several months and I would really like to complete her quest.<p>Thanks,<br>Templar Crestus</I><p><B>Well, we thought we had her fixed with the last patch. But she refuses to be fixable.<p>Basically, despite intense effort on our part, she won't spawn as she is supposed to. We don't know why. We've rebuilt her and everything about her. We've examined everything and can't locate what it is that keeps her from spawning.<p>We're sorry about the problem, and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can.<p>Alan</B><p><I> Seemingly Tireless EQ Team,<p>I was simply wondering whether the broken &quot;Your faction standing with (X) could not possibly get better/worse.&quot; message was fixed with this past Wednesday's patch as was hoped. I did not notice a mention of it in the patch message.<p>Thanks.<p>- Shendare</I><p><B>Actually, it was fixed between a couple of emergency patches. So it was fixed a little while ago.<p>I'm sorry that we didn't announce it. There was a communications breakdown because of the emergency patches. I'll see who I have to kill to keep it from happening again... <p>Alan</B><p>Someone needs to be reminded that threats of physical violence are against the EverQuest code of conduct.
