Uh, Screenshots</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-10-09</p>Brad <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000344.html">posted</a> over on Developer's Corner about some feedback he's been getting on the flood of recently posted Luclin <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=2022313226">screenshots</a>. Here's a snippet:<p><B>On the whole, we've received both positive and negative responses. I'd like to comment briefly about the negativity.<p>First, there's certainly nothing wrong with sending it in -- we want players' true feelings about the issue. And we are listening.<p>Second, though, we do understand that players have built up an emotional attachment to their existing characters and their character's appearances. And this is totally normal and expected, and ultimately it's why we're keeping an option in to display the older characters if desired. We certainly realize that some players will flat out prefer to stay the way they are - after all, this is a game that's been out a while, and changing the status quo always creates controversy. It is also worth noting that the responses to the Vah Shir and the horse (as well as the backgrounds) were almost universally positive, and by and large, we feel this is because there's no point of reference and no pre-existing emotional attachment to that content (they were, by the way, created by the same art team as the other models).<p>That said, we absolutely want as many people to be pleased with the new models as possible, and so we will continue to make tweaks and adjustments and to issue new screen shots reflecting those changes. The characters, while nearing completion, are still very much 'work in progress.' We also hope that as you see the new characters more often, you'll get used the changes and start to appreciate even more the details and features this new technology allows us to explore. I know personally that I was a bit shocked and taken aback when I saw the first round of Luclin characters, but now that I've worked with the team day after day, watched the advances, and really become used to looking at them, I just can't go back - the older characters just pale in comparison.</B><p>He goes on to mention a few specific points, which I'll just sumarize.<p>1. The faces look a bit stiff because they're intended to use animations, which aren't active yet.<p>2. Ogres look different because they are evolving (devolving, perhaps) and becoming a little smarter and stronger, like they used to be before they were cursed by the gods. It's like what happened with the Klingons as they went from TOS to TNG, but in reverse. Or something.<p>3. Female models aren't wearing sexy clothing; in fact, the outfits are more modest than the models from the original game. Wave goodbye to the thongs, it would seem.<p>Keep giving the team feedback as more screenshots arrive. Got any monk shots, Brad?<p>In other news, players have <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000333.html">noticed</a> that the skies and landscapes seem to be brighter after the patch. Absor responds:<p><B>Things might have been tuned up a bit. Everyone should probably recheck their gamma settings and think about turning them back down a few notches. <p>Alan</B><p>Finally, if you frequent Eastern Wastes, you might notice a new resident outside Sleeper's Tomb. Garath the Trader, a non-Coldain faction dwarf, is looking to make a trade. If you are a monk, he'll take your priceless or primal hammer and give you priceless or primal velium fist wraps, which have an upgraded ratio of 15/20 (over the standard 13/20) and all the respective stats of their hammer counterparts, but weighing a mere 0.5. For paladins and shadowknights, he'll take your priceless or primal 1HS warswords and give you a very knightly blade indeed, with a 20/20 ratio and all the stats of the original.<p>If you look at this and other changes to high-end monk weapons, you'll see that Verant is serious when they say they want monks to do more toe-to-toe damage. This change is basically a free upgrade to a very godly weapon. Whether monks can stay alive while using them will be the real test.<p>As for the pally/SK blades, 20/20 for a 1HS weapon seems ridiculous, until you remember that these classes can't dual wield. Combine one of these swords with a shield from North ToV and you have a very powerful knight indeed.<p>It would have been kind of nice if there were class-specific turn-ins for the 2H priceless and primal, as the 45/44 ratio isn't that great, but I guess you can't have everything.<p>Or can we? Maybe if I promise to buy Luclin and not write any more <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-1467486383">&quot;reviews&quot;</a> of DAoC...
