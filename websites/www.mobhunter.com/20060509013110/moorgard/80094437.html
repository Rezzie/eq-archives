<html><head><title>Utilitarian Update</title></head><body><h1>Utilitarian Update</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-05-01</p><BIG>See Patch. See Patch Run. See Patch Run into Another Patch</big><p>In a fit of unmitigated honesty and humility, the EQ Ops team is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000559.html">letting us know</a> how badly FUBARed the servers will be next week:<p><B>On Wednesday, May 8th, at 2AM PDT, (9AM GMT), all servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. Due to the nature of these updates, we do anticipate additional downtime to occur. Most likely, the servers will be coming back down briefly after they are brought live for all players. Therefore, the initial downtime we anticipate is 8 hours. Once the servers are up, the next 4-6 hours could see several smaller patches applied which would require the downing of all world servers.</b><p>We've come to anticipate additional downtime after major patches, so this isn't so completely unexpected, but it was nice of them to let us know that they know.<p><BIG>/quit Bugging Me!</big><p>A player <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000560.html">suggested</a> that typing /1 to respond to a chat channel leads to far too many accidental activations of the /q command, which causes you to instantly go linkdead. A solution was proposed, and Absor liked it:<p><B>Consider it done. You should see it in the next patch (barring some horrible radiation accident or invasion by aliens).<p>/q will fail if it sees /q [anytext].<p>Thanks for the suggestion.</b><p>I've never made that mistake (yet), but it's a good idea.<p><Big>A Petition for Shorter Responses to Petitions</big><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000555.html">responded</a> to some of the heat he's taken for trying to discourage message board petitions. It's a really, really long response, so if you're one of those &quot;it's your job to interact with us and listen to everything we say&quot; people, then go read it. Me, I just like this quote:<p><B>The very last thing that any of us wants is for the community of these independent message boards to be ruined by the presence of EQ Dev team members.</b><p>Obviously, people like Absor and Hammerfel don't care about Mobhunter, as they have given us the kiss of death by posting here. Why do you hate us? What did we ever do to you?<p>Um, on second thought, don't answer that...<p><BIG>/yawn</big><p>There are some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000558.html">changes</a> coming to the Firiona Vie and Sullon Zek servers. An effort to get people to play on the servers, it seems. If such a subject interests you, then click on the link.<p>Sorry for the near lack of witty commentary in this roundup. I really want to save my juice (Craig Kilborn-ism) for the editorial, because I'm pretty cheesed off. But this spartan roundup will be worth it, because later--like Hemingway--I'll be shooting an elephant.<p>And before anyone from the ASPCA or PETA flames me, try reading some freaking literature.
