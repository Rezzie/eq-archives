Absor responded thusly:<p><B>The Trivial Loot Code is indeed a restriction based on the level of the character. But it isn't a punishment, as if gaining levels was a bad thing. It is simply a way of keeping content available to those characters of the level that the content was designed for. It's really no different than the fact that low level characters are restricted from accessing high level content, or that enchanters are restricted from accessing certain quests designed for paladins, or that worshippers of a certain deity are restricted from using items designed for worshippers of another deity.</B><p>I hate it when Absor is so... logical. Alright, uberd00ds, let's admit that just because we're level 60 and dress all <a href="http://www.pixyland.org/peterpan/Imagez/peter_stand_large.jpg">fancy</a> doesn't mean we have to do *every* quest in the game. Of course, I do want some of those things that cast snare, so /rude Verant.<p><B>Home, Home on the Wastes</B><p>Absor said she wouldn't be around until the next patch, but apparently Western Wastes came down on some (all?) servers this morning and Jaled's daughter is <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8028.topic">back</a>. Word is she's tanned, rested, and looking for romance. Warm-blooded bipeds need not apply.<p><B>Charging Camelot</B><p>Seems a lot of folks are <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Vl3zxmvxXTM&amp;offerid=13850.209015&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" >preordering</a><IMG border=0 width=1 height=1 src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=Vl3zxmvxXTM&amp;bids=13850&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" > Dark Age of Camelot from EBgames.com. It's raced up the charts to become their #2 best seller. Stick that in your server population and smoke it.<p><B>Mutual Admiration Society</B><p>We like Lum the Mad. The <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net/">site</a> and the retired ranter of the same name who now works at Mythic. We read them and cite their stories, and lately they've been doing the <a href="http://lumthemad.net/story.php?story=2263">same</a> for us.<p>Why am I telling you this? Well, I'm doing a news update about a news update so that I can link to their link in the hopes that they will link back to it. Got that?<p>Like I said, it's the Friday before a holiday...
