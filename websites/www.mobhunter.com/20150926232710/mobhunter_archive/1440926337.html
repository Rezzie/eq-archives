We'll start with the most interesting one, in case you're as sleepy as I am.<p>On what will be motivating the level 60 players to be taking exp camps from level 50 players:<p><I><B>[Solist] (Bill Coyle) Basically, high level players will be able to use experience gained towards new skills and traits rather than leveling...which of course isn't important once you've reached 60. These traits will contain many options from reduced casting time for wizards to the ability for a paladin to increase his lay on hands skill to heal completely. We're still playing around with the finalized list, but I'm sure it'll be a much desired feature for all.</B><p>I am curious to how this will be handled. Will there be a range of different abilities to chose from like current disciplines? Will I eventually be able to get all, say, 10 abilities available to my class? Or will the abilites scale up with time... in the quote above, it says wizards will be able to get reduced casting time for their spells. Perhaps if I trade in some of my experience, my spells will now cast 96% as fast as they used to, but will I be able to trade in more experience in addition to that which I have sacrificed to get 92% casting time? Basically, can we get more information on how these abilities will be given out?</I><p><B>I really can't tell you anything about that yet. Not only do we want to tease you all a little bit more, but we haven't finalized the system yet. But Solist is correct, there should be some interesting stuff in there for everyone.<p>Alan</B><p>This experience trade-in thing sounds good, but don't expect massive changes to your abilities--most upgrades will provide minimal enhancements. Still, anything is better than going nowhere with a full exp bar.<p>On the fact that the patch server has been supplying files you already downloaded:<p><B>We're sorry about the problems the patch servers were causing. As Mr. Smedley said (though not using these words... :) ) the goofy things the patchers were doing is not related in any way to the methods we use to catch hackers.<p>The old patch server was causing people re-download files and making accessing the game somewhat difficult. Again, we're sorry for the problem.<p>Alan</B><p>There was speculation that the constant re-patching people are running into had something to do with the recent bannings. Relax--it's just a system glitch and it will be fixed.<p>On the connection problems that have plagued many players as of late:<p><B>Recently we have been troubleshooting an issue with one of our ISP's. This troubleshooting is ongoing. At this time, by keeping this ISP in the mix, we feel that we can no longer provide the quality of service that EverQuest players have come to expect. We have therefore temporarily turned down our connection to this ISP and re-routed this traffic to our other ISP's. Best efforts are being made to resolve this issue. Once we are convinced the solution has been found we will bring this ISP back online. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused and will provide an update to the community once the situation is resolved.<p>EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>The most significant thing from that paragraph is the obvious need for a usable pronoun for &quot;ISP.&quot;<p>Absor also talks about how players' levels were given a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000338.html">boost</a> on the Firiona Vie server for the purpose of helping test some of the upper-end content. I'd quote some of it, but that would put me to sleep before I could post this article.
