No News</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-10-08</p><BIG>World Where You Live</BIG><p>While the debate continues as to whether having localized servers in Europe and other countries is a good thing, the main cause of concern for non-US players is that Planes of Power won't be on store shelves until late November. Sure, Verant is offering <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=51994">pre-orders</a> with a reasonable overseas shipping rate, but some folks prefer buying from a local store--which won't be an option for those who want to play alongside their US guildmates on the day of release.<p>GM Saryahn from the Ubi Soft customer service staff dropped us a line to explain the one-month delay a bit. Basically, the major points are as follows:<p>- Ubi Soft needs to receive the masters of the completed expansion from SOE, and SOE completes their own masters before doing the ones for Ubi Soft<p>- The masters then need to be tested in Europe to make sure they work properly on the new servers<p>- The CD itself needs to be manufactured; while this process might only take a week in the US, it can take three to four weeks in Europe to go from masters to product release<p>You can either accept these reasons or believe there is some conspiracy against non-US players--it's up to you. Certainly such delays could have been avoided with better planning or a different production schedule. However, given the fact that Verant tweaks their expansions until the last possible second, and given that there is a lot of stuff in motion at Ubi Soft right now, we tend to accept the simpler explanation: this is just the best they could do under the circumstances.<p>If you're a non-US player who doesn't want to move to localized servers, just pre-order the regular version of PoP from Verant or get it through a friend or an online place that will ship to you. Problem solved, for the most part.<p><BIG>Attack! Or the Lack Thereof</BIG><p>Over at the Fires of Heaven board, testing seems to indicate that there is a <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=3176">cap on ATK</a> gainable from items. The magic number is apparently 250, and the Avatar proc from primal/prismatic weapons counts against it. Since a big part of the draw of gear from Vex Thal is the ATK boost so many of the items give, this cap limits the usefulness of VT equipment and, to an extent, the weapons from ST.<p>Whether the cap is intentional or not remains to be seen. Verant was quick to address the discovery of the mana cap, so let's see if they move as fast on this issue. In the meantime, shamans are bemoaning requests to <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=1c08550d14a99308facec3080c45f428&amp;threadid=6264">keep some form of Avatar memorized</a> to make tanks happy.<p>Those shamans are a crusty lot, aren't they?<p><BIG>The More, the Merrier</BIG><p>A fairly significant change in how EQ works is having an effect on pullers and <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showMessage?topicID=296.topic">AE groups</a>. In case you never noticed it before, it used to be that only four mobs could hit you at any one time. Sure, you could aggro more than that, but once you had four actually hitting you then the rest would either stop in their tracks or path about strangely.<p>A recent patch changed this behavior, however, and now <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=6930.topic">NPCs can gang up on you</a>. This makes life interesting for enchanters as well, since they aren't... uh, the most robust of creatures, shall we say.<p>Again, whether this was an intentional change on Verant's part or an error in code is hard to say. I guess further testing after the next patch will be the best way to figure that out.<p><BIG>Use Your Illusion</BIG><p>Speaking of enchanters, one of their new PoP skills will allow them to <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=77732">project illusions</a> onto other players. This means that any player can be transformed into any other playable race--assuming one knows the right enchanter, of course.<p>While many classes are pleased about this fun little ability, none are quite as happy as monks. You see, for years there has been a not-so-underground movement to try to get <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=32709.topic">gnome monks</a> into the game. While this may not be a permanent solution, at least it should fulfill the sick fantasies of monks (but not mine--I swear!) for a little while.<p>Hey, at least we aren't screaming for <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=21334.topic">pointy hats</a> or something.<p><BIG>Camping's Not For Me</BIG><p>A reader named Caelestis dropped us a line to give at least a partical solution to the /camp desktop problem:<p><B>To get camp desktop to work simply issue the /camp desktop command and then go into your spell book. This will sucessfully close EQ and bring you back to your desktop. I know this doesn't help non-caster classes but knowing this maybe you could find similar things that might work for pure fighters.</B><p>I tried it on a couple casters, and sure enough it works great. So far I haven't found anything that will help pure melee characters in a similar manner, but if anyone does, please post here or <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">drop me a line</a>.<p>I'm not a fan of camping. But when I camp, I like to do it in style.
