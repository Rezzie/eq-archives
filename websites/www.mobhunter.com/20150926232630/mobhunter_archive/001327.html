<h1 class="article_title">Something New</h1>
<p>by Loral on May 16, 2004</p>

<p>Things are busy for me here at the Mobhunter compound. Not only is it my job to make Loral's coffee, but I also keep his cup fresh while he's typing on our strict deadlines. Add to that my time spent on the phone begging SoE to hire me as Moorgard's coffee guy and it becomes clear that there's little time left for things like site design and maintenance.</p>

<p>I have taken some time from my sycophantic toadying to add a little something new to the Mobhunter franchise. I think it's pretty self explanatory. Give it a try.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this, like everything here at Mobhunter, is a work in progress. I have other cool features that aren't implemented yet. And clearly, not every EQ server is yet supported. If people like this tool, I'll make it better.</p>

<p>Post here to let me know what you think.</p>
