<html><head><title>A Weekend of Legends</title></head><body><h1>A Weekend of Legends</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-02-04</p>In case you just crawled out from under a rock, let me tell you a little bit about what <a href="http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/showcase/home.jsp">Legends</a> is.<p>Legends is a new type of server that is limited to 8,000 players and has a higher fee of $39.95 a month. For the extra cash, you get more features:<p><B>1. Character Pages</B> - A combination home page and inventory database (updated automatically by the server) that tracks your items, character info, and text that you add.<p><B>2. Dynamic Server</B> - A smaller player population with a larger GM staff that conducts many events. Historical quests will be held on Legends first, and much of the content will be exclusive.<p><B>3. Legendary Items</B> - Unique new loot will show up on Legends first.<p><B>4. Calendar of Events</B> - The GM staff posts upcoming events, and players can add their own.<p><B>5. Interactive Maps</B> - A very cool dynamic map that tracks where you have been, where you are, and where your friends and guildmates are hanging out.<p><B>6. Tales of Adventure</B> - Player-submitted stories will be posted, or something.<p><B>7. Guild Halls</B> - An online guild management system and message board.<p>Of those seven features, numbers 1, 4, 6, and 7 can all be done now via homemade or third-party tools. The interactive map is a neat feature, but not $40 neat. That really leaves the larger GM staff and the exclusive new items as the most compelling selling points for the new server.<p>So is that enough? It seems to me that lots of folks had knee-jerk reactions to the announcement of Legends. Angry players had varying responses, but some common themes were:<p>- I shouldn't have to pay $30 extra for good customer service. This new server will get all the attention and there will be even less GMs on the &quot;cheap&quot; servers.<p>- The game is call Ever<B>Quest</B>. I should be getting dynamic quests <I>now.</I><p>- Tom Brady played well, but did nothing to earn the MVP award. (Okay, I added this one.)<p>- Legends just caters to powergamers and fanbois.<p>- Verant is just in it for the cash, and they don't care who they screw over.<p>Let's think about these points. I agree that customer service is part of what we pay for, and Verant's had a spotty track record in the past. But in the last nine months or so, the company has made huge strides forward in providing better CS. You just don't read about the obvious blunders that GMs used to make, and while players aren't always happy with the answers to their petitions, I'd still say that GMs go a good job most of the time. I don't believe Legends will get in the way of this, and I don't think Verant make the mistake of reducing its CS force on the other servers. But I guess time will tell.<p>Dynamic quests and events have been happening in EQ since way back when. For the most part, these events would be ruined by the appearance of idiots who attacked the quest characters, begged for loot, or cast annoying spells (Staff of the Observer, anyone?). It always seemed like about half the players wanted actual events, but the other half simply wanted to kill stuff and get loot. Maybe with a higher fee, grief players will stick to the old servers and Legends could really provide a cool interactive environment. Does this mean the regular servers don't deserve GM quests? Of course not. But Legends might provide an alternative for someone who finds such interaction to be the biggest draw of the game.<p>Are unique items worth paying the extra cash for? That's a tough call. Clearly, a lot of players get enjoyment from showing off rare or unique loot (else every uberguild on the block wouldn't have its own Web site). While having some new item named after your character would be spiffy, players have to decide for themselves how valuable this feature is.<p>Does Legends just cater to the desires of the elite? Are all those character pages designed simply to feed the egos of those Fires of Heaven people? In a way, yes... but that's pretty smart thinking of Verant's part. I think Legends actually <I>needs</I> an uberguild's presence to be successful. What better billboard is there to encourage people to play EverQuest than for someone to click over to the Legends pages and see epic battles with the toughest mobs in the game? If I were Verant, I'd be offering free character moves and Legends accounts to FoH, or Legacy of Steel, or Afterlife, or somebody. There's no better PR for your game than success.<p>Of all the arguments against Legends, I think the weakest one is the &quot;Verant is just out to screw everyone out of money&quot; mentality. Frankly, it's ridiculous. Did you ever notice that even when uberguilds rant at some Verant screw-up or complain about something that's broken in the game, they don't accuse Verant of acting simply out of greed? That's because, whatever else you want to say about them, guys like Furor and Tigole know that the people at Verant really aren't out to get you. The ones who do make claims like this are usually those who aren't very good or successful players, who simply lash out at Verant for perceived game flaws that are actually just reflections of their own lack of skill and character. This is not to say that everyone who has a gripe against EverQuest is a talentless moron; quite the contrary. But good players know specifically where to place the blame, and don't abjectly piss into the wind with meaningless claims that Verant is staffed solely by money-grubbing weasels who don't care about the game. That argument simply doesn't hold water.<p>Legends certainly isn't for everyone. If you don't play the game a lot at $9.89 a month, then you're unlikely to gain much value by shelling out four times that amount. Clearly, this service will attract the more dedicated player. And therein lies my greatest cause for concern: what happens if the entire population of 8,000 is made up of all hardcore powergamers who want to raid NToV at the same time? Granted, this is unlikely, but it's possible that Legends might have even worse population dispersement problems than regular servers do, considering the relatively similar times that most raiding guilds seem to play.<p>When all is said and done, is Legends worth it? While this might sound like a cop-out, in all honesty, that's up to you. I'm not going to move to Legends, but I certainly wouldn't mock anyone who did. Considering the fact that some people already pay $40 or more for their stable of EverQuest accounts, the extra cash isn't really the biggest factor. If the features sound cool to you, and the price seems fair, go for it.<p>Will Legends be good or bad for EverQuest as a whole? That's impossible to say. I honestly don't believe the new servers will have a significant impact on the old ones. While $40 is obviously an attractive price point for Verant, they aren't stupid enough to throw away the half million subscribers that were lured in by the $10 monthly fee. Whatever you think of the pricing, Legends will be followed closely by the MMOG market. If Legends is a success, it will prove that gamers are willing to pay a premium for exclusive service and unique content, which may usher in a whole new formula for online gaming. Why shouldn't companies have different pricing tiers that allow you to select the amount of company interaction you are comfortable with? In the same way you select what you want your cable TV package to include, maybe you will be able to select what kinds of gaming content you will pay for.<p>For me, Legends is neither good nor evil at this point. But I, like the rest of the industry, will be watching closely to see whether Verant's latest gamble is going to prove as fruitful as their previous ventures. If last weekend's Super Bowl from Bizzaro World had a lesson, it's that anything can happen.
