Yet somehow, in the back of my mind, I knew I would.<p>The crash of American Airlines flight 587 may have nothing to do with terrorism. I pray to God not. But the very notion of it has me--and I'm sure many Americans--twisted up inside.<p>For two months, we've tried our best to go on with our normal lives. While we kept the memory of that blackest of days always in mind, we were asked to carry on with the business of living. As a tribute to those lost, we could do no less. And for these two months, we've done a pretty good job of it.<p>But this morning I got an instant message from a friend of mine in New York, and all the emotions come flooding back. It feels like I've been kicked in the gut once again.<p>It's a sad thing to say, but plane crashes never had that big an effect on me before. Sure I was sad that people died, but I can't say it had a huge impact on my emotional state.<p>Today's crash, however, has ripped open a thinly stitched scar, releasing a flood of sadness and frustration. If there was any doubt, the wound is still there, as raw and aching as it was on September 11.<p>Whatever the cause, today's crash has left a multitude of victims in its wake--hundreds on a plane that didn't reach its destination, and hundreds more who will never see their loved ones again. Our prayers go out to all of them.<p>Yet another reminder that life is to be cherished.<p>Go, right now, and do that.
