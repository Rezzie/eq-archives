In the porn industry, this is known as &quot;blowing your wad,&quot; which is considered a bad thing if ill-timed, but in this case we have no choice but to risk it. If this article started off with anything else, you'd be asleep right now. Assuming, of course, that you aren't already.<p>Brad showed up with a <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/php-bin/eq/showthreaded.php?Cat=&amp;Board=eqwestwood&amp;Number=642074&amp;page=&amp;view=&amp;sb=&amp;o=">post</a> over on the <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/">EQ Stratics</a> message board. He talks a bit about why he left Verant, referencing the two posts before his (hence the player names below). Read those two posts--they're good.<p><B>Meladin &amp; Ididar, <p>Tremendous insight there :) While it's not all accurate, the general gist is, that being that I think I would indeed be more happy in a smaller studio, focussing on less products or even one, and then doing this all again :) <p>An entire company grew out of EQ's success, and I'm very proud of that, and wish them nothing but the best. But it's different now, and I want to be more hands-on again. <p>-Aradune</B><p>While this casts some doubt on my &quot;Brad was forced out&quot; theory from <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-1496772966">yesterday</a>, it doesn't necessarily invalidate it, either. In fact, my new working theory is that the real Brad was kidnapped by Mythic and replaced with an <a href="http://funnystrange.com/quiz/">evil</a> replicant. Dreams of unicorns and flying cars have ensued.<p>So why did Verant change the EQ Web site? Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000352.html">elaborates</a>:<p><B>Those of you that post to and read the Developer's Corner are probably familiar with the old EverQuest.com. That site basically caters to the experienced player, it's where we talk about new features, gameplay and stuff like that. A lot of that information isn't really useful to a potential new customer. When I want to learn about a game, I want to see screenshots, I want to get a feel for it. That's what we're trying to achieve with EverQuest.com. I've read comments on the net suggesting that it is just a marketing site now. That's almost true. We certainly want it to be appealing to potential players without blasting them with complicated concepts like melee balance changes when they just want to see if they are interested in the game at all. We do indeed want to sell the game to potential players through EverQuest.com.<p>So we renamed the old EverQuest.com site, it is now EverQuest Live. For those of you that are experienced EverQuest players, EverQuest Live is probably the site you want to bookmark (<a href="http://www.everquestlive.com">www.everquestlive.com</a>).</B><p>Truthfully, I don't know anyone who would admit to being a big fan of the old EQ site anyway. You don't look very 733t if you have <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/index.jsp">Harpy's Head Tavern</a> set as your home page. Still, it's hip to make fun of <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/featured_content/fippyfacts/index.jsp">Fippy's Facts</a>, so don't feel too guilty checking out the above link.<p>In old, moldy news, <I>Computer Games</I> magazine put last month's print issue online, so you can read that <a href="http://www.cgonline.com/previews/everquest-01c-p2.html">article</a> about horses in Luclin if you want. There are some screenshots too, but you've seen better already.<p>Did we mention a patch is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000351.html">scheduled</a> for the 23rd? We did? Damn.<p>That's about all the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,47552,00.html">news</a> we have for you at this point. Go wake the Sleeper or something.
