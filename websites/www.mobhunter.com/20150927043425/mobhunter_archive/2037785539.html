A player claiming to be from one of the uberest guilds ever complained that now the quest is way too hard:<p><B>The level of the mobs at this stage does make them very difficult to manage. This was intentional. I have personally participated as a player in the event both before and after the bug fix. It is still very possible for a good force of players to get to the fifth boss of the encounter, and as players become more powerful through alternate advancement abilities and equipment they may indeed make it farther. <p>As for smaller raid forces, there are some rewards for making it to the fourth boss that veteran players would be happy with. <p>The encounter is now as difficult as it was designed to be after the fourth boss. The treasure available past that point is commensurate with the difficulty, and the ability for players to obtain it very frequently makes it necessary to require a solid force of players.<p>If time permits, I may place a few waves in between these stages to make the progression more granular. This would have the side effect of taking longer to get to the toughest encounters. <p>As always, I am open to ideas. Feel free to email me any well thought out suggestions.</B><p>The brave soul even left his address so you could <a href="mailto:sburke@soe.sony.com">e-mail</a> your ideas to him. Having experienced the joy of the RoF after the upgrade, I agree that the quest is entirely different now. It takes an extremely talented guild at the top of their game to get to the fifth boss, and while the rewards are very good, there is a comparable loot elsewhere in Luclin that is easier to obtain. Methinks a bit of tuning is in order. Not much, but a bit.<p>Oh, Absor also wrote some more about <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000471.html">FanFaire</a>, but it was boring, so we're not posting it.<p><BIG>And Why <I>Is</I> It So Damn Misty There, Anyway?</BIG><p>Muse at EQ Atlas strikes again, this time kickin' it old school with a map of <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/cityofmist.html">City of Mist</a>. Just in case you've never been there, CoM is a nice place to get some l3wtz for your favorite <a href="http://www.bol.ucla.edu/~rahjr79/ninja.htm">monk</a>. Lesser classes like shamans and enchanters have some epic quest junk there, too.<p><BIG>Poe Pontificates Precipitously Per Previous Panel</BIG><p>Casters Realm has posted a <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4063">transcript</a> of Lawrence Poe's panel on magic from the Dallas FanFaire. It's a good read; Poe is a smart guy, and he really digs his job. He talks about all kinds of things, but what he said about the drop rates of shaman spells really caught my eye:<p><B>There's something of a phenomenon here because all the class spell drops are the same percentage.  I read a lot of class forums and things, and really, Shamans just seem to be really unlucky.  I'm serious, all the spell drops are on a very even percentage chance they can drop.  I do concede though that maybe they could be looked at across the board.  It isn't a Shaman specific thing though.</B><p>After reading this, I thought to myself, &quot;I wonder if this irritated shamans at all.&quot; Knowing this surly lot, I didn't have to wonder long. The word &quot;livid&quot; doesn't even <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=7cbf19c4f62a9bc5d6767d200b3023a2&amp;threadid=19570">come close</a>. As one shaman so delicately put it: &quot;Poe can kiss my fluffy white ass.&quot;<p>If you're a caster, you should read this transcript. Most of the stuff is over my thick melee head, but it sure sounds <a href="http://slate.msn.com//?id=2057934">important</a>.<p><BIG>Verant's Pet Class... No, I Mean... Aw, Forget It</BIG><p>Beastlords saw their Wild Lord's armor get <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9587.topic">upgraded</a> in the last patch, with added AC and effects. Of course, it didn't take long for this Safehouse thread to deteriorate into a monk whinefest because they don't have any Kunark armor and their AC sucks.<p>This seems like a good opportunity to point something out. Poor little Moorgard takes heat every time he pokes fun at a caster whine thread: &quot;He hates necros! He hates wizards!&quot; Yet I am just as likely to make fun of my own class (monks), or paladins, or rogues, or whatever.<p>What's the key here? I make fun of <B>whiners</B>. Monks, for example, don't have much to complain about these days, so when I see a monk really going off about how tough he has it, I call him out. Same goes for a wizard who complains about being underpowered, or a rogue who complains that her backstabs don't allow her to solo Veeshan's Peak, or whatever.<p>Luckily for me, it's very simple to cruise the class boards and find a whiner in any class you can name. Thus, I am always assured of being able to make fun of at least one class in every news roundup. If I haven't gotten to yours yet, please be patient; I will.<p><BIG>The Shadows Have Returned to SND</BIG><p>The URL for <a href="http://www.slownewsday.net">Slow News Day</a> is still active, and the page has recently been updated to read &quot;Coming Soon.&quot; No one knows whether the once and former rant site will actually be returning, but my sources indicate that the chances are slight at best. Still, more unlikely things have happened. I mean, <I>the Patriots are going to the SuperBowl,</I> for pity's sake!<p><BIG>If the Game Sucks, Distract Them With Boobies</BIG><p>Astounding though it may be, Anarchy Online is still up and running. This flashy game showed a lot of promise, but was soon proven to be the most despised online fiasco ever unleashed upon the public (and yes, that includes the first day of Luclin).<p>Nobody has been a tougher critic of Funcom's product than the folks at The Chosen, but even these guys appreciate the new AO <a href="http://www.thechosen.com/news/fullnews.cgi?newsid1012251986,19545,">ad campaign</a>. Maybe some hot virtual flesh can sucker a few people into subscribing to the game. Hey, anything can happen--see the Patriots quote above.<p><BIG>Even the Uberest Guilds Can Cry</BIG><p>At the new <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/">Legacy of Steel</a> site (update those bookmarks, people!), Tigole goes on a rather lengthy rant about the current state of EQ's high-end game. What used to take a l33t uberguild months of work to accomplish is now doable by any group of mediocre players:<p><B>The first major, game altering change took place with the big magic resist patch.  While the patch was overall a good thing, making casters more useful, it trivialized a number of *uber* encounters.  Now back to that fast foward.  Add the Shadows of Luclin Alternate Advancement skills into the mix and you have created an environment where basically anyone who can gather 40 people in front of a mob and have them press A at the right time can kill about 90 percent of the uber mobs that exist.  What I am saying is that uber encounters have been gimped -- straight up.</B><p>Tigole goes on to make some suggestions for ways Verant could fix the game, including adding more content, increasing and randomizing spawn rates, fixing the way triggered spawns work, and adding more servers.<p>While not all these ideas are workable, the overall point is a good one. High-end content is needed more and more every day, and the Luclin expansion didn't really add enough to keep the top guilds interested (aside from the AAXP system, of course).<p>Clearly another raid-oriented expansion along the lines of Velious is needed if EQ wants to stay vital. If EverQuest is going to remain Verant's flagship for another year, I predict such an expansion to be announced within a couple months. Should Verant decide to shift their focus to a whole new product--such as EverQuest 2--then I think Luclin will be the end of the line.<p>In the meantime, zone revamps will help a bit. When Veeshan's Peak finally gets its overhaul, let's hope it comes out as an alternate version of Temple of Veeshan North. This would give uberguilds some variety, and might allow guilds on their way up the chance to take a shot at some of the older high-end content without competition.<p>Okay, guess that's enough news for tonight. Any more, and you're liable to become bloated and gassy.
