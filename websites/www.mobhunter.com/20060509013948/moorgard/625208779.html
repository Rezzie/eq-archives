<html><head><title>The Countdown Begins</title></head><body><h1>The Countdown Begins</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-10-14</p><BIG>PoParations Continue</BIG><p>With the official release of Planes of Power only a week (!) away, Verant is in a tweaking frenzy. Good old Lucy has been overloaded with <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2002-10-13%2005:30:07">hundreds</a> of <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2002-10-14%2002:42:10">spell changes</a> over the weekend, many of which have been <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=876840909">summarized for you</a> by a reader named Onetree.<p>But it's not just spells; other changes on Test are having a more direct effect upon melee types. For instance, the Planar Durability skill <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3210">has been changed</a> to read as follows:<p><B>The Planes demand a certain hardiness of those who adventure within. Each rank of this ability adds an additional 5% to your maximum hit points. You gain the ability to train an additional rank at levels 61, 63, and 65.</B><p>When originally put into the game, PD was purchasable five times--once at each level from 61-65. So instead of a 25% hitpoint increase, the skill now only provides 15%.<p>But even more significant is the fact that the skill has now been limited exclusively to the three &quot;tank&quot; classes: warriors, paladins, and shadowknights. These three already had the highest hitpoint pools in the game, and now the gap between them and other classes is only going to widen more.<p>Is this a good thing? Well, in one sense it is, as it separates the true tanks from the situational ones. Monks, rogues, and rangers were never intended to be raid-capable tanks, yet this is a role that monks, at least, have found themselves in as of late.<p>But on the other hand, it does take away a very significant avenue of character advancement from non-tanks. Perhaps other melee classes could have access to a toned-down version of the skill, either offering a smaller percentage increase (like 3% per level) or having only one or two tiers, thus making the increase 5% or 10% and reserving the 15% increase only for tanks.<p>I definitely see the decrease from 25% more hitpoints to 15% as a good thing. Frankly, the original number felt too much like MUDflation, especially considering that players will also be able to gain hitpoints by raising the cap on their stamina by 50 points through the use of the Planar Power skill. So in other words, warriors with 10,000 hitpoints won't be found hanging out at the orc camps in East Commonlands--and that's a good thing.<p><BIG>Getting Defensive</BIG><p>Rangers are shooting celebratory arrows skyward over news that their <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=e2d271ac82c06d4382ddd05464c00413&amp;threadid=11366">Defense cap has been raised</a> on Test server from 220 to 240. This increases ranger AC substantially and should help them live longer, less vulnerable lives.<p>Some paladins, of course, <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showMessage?topicID=282.topic">aren't excited about this idea</a>. After all, rangers are the hybrid with better offense skills, while paladins and SKs get the higher defense capabilities. Some pallys are thinking they should see similar increases offensively to compensate.<p>The problem, of course, is that raising someone's defense by twenty points is not the same as raising someone else's offense by that much. Being given twenty apples is not the same as being given twenty oranges. Rangers are a chain class, and thus should be closer to the defensive capabilities of rogues (who probably have defensive skills that are too high, but that's another topic). This seems like a pretty safe change, since rangers still won't be used to tank anything noteworthy.<p>It is, however, a bit painful for monks to see <I>any</I> class get a defensive increase at the same time monkies are under the proverbial knife. Perhaps the change to PD and more tweaking to the defensive capabilities of other classes will require the <a href="http://shell4.bayarea.net/~tenarius/mudwimping.html">wimping of monks</a> to be less severe than originally intended. Meanwhile, there is a whole <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17">forum dedicated to complaints</a> on the monk board, so affected parties can vent their frustrations o'er yonder.<p>You know what? Nerf my defenses all you want. <B>Just give me my missing 7 hitpoints back.</B> Thanks.<p><BIG>Signs Point to a Refund</BIG><p>Verant announced last week that other skills besides manaburn <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52219">will be refunded</a> with the next patch:<p><B>Due to the upcoming changes to Manaburn, Rods of Mystical Transvergence and a previous change to Innate Regeneration, we will be reimbursing several Alternate Advancement (AA) abilities. This will happen with the next patch (scheduled for 3 am the morning of October 16th). <p>Once you log on after the patch, if you have any of these abilities, please check your AA window immediately! <p>If you have more than 30 unspent points, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT that you make certain that your character has 30 or fewer AA points before the launch of Planes of Power on October 21st! The return of these AA points may put your total number of unspent points over the 30 point maximum. Your pool will be reduced to 30 the first time you log in after the launch of Planes of Power on October 21st. <p>We will be refunding all Alternate Advancement points in the following abilities: <p>Innate Regeneration<br>Manaburn<br>Mental Clarity<br>Quick Summoning <p>Refunded Alternate Advancement points may be spent in any way you choose.</B><p>This is a fair move for casters, who might want to redirect their points in another area--or just buy the same skills again, if they so desire. The regen refund is a nice bone for trolls and iksars who originally gained higher regen from Innate Regeneration than other races did before the skill was nerfed.<p>Some casters have expressed concern that they will be getting so many points refunded that it will put them over the limit of 30 and the points will be lost. Please note that <B>the 30-point rule doesn't take effect until Planes of Power goes live,</B> so nobody will lose any points after this week's patch.<p><BIG>Standing in a Straight Linux</BIG><p>There is certainly no shortage of animosity in the world towards Microsoft and Windows. Even though Windows XP is tons better than previous versions, there are some who insist on raging against the Gatesian machine by running a flavor of the Linux operating system. Unfortunately, this has always meant restrictions as to what software could be used on the UNIX-based platforms.<p>Not so any longer. Support for running Windows applications on Linux has been building for a while, and now even EQ players can get into the act. <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/10/12/2037231&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=127">Slashdot is reporting</a> that the newest version of <a href="http://www.transgaming.com/">Transgaming's WineX</a> includes support for EverQuest. WineX is a Windows API implementation under Linux that allows more and more games to run on the alternative OS.<p>The solution isn't perfect, as is made clear in the <a href="http://downloads.transgaming.com/files/winex-2_2-releasenotes.txt">release notes</a>. However, careful tweaking has lead to success that makes Linux lovers <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=33037.topic">bounce up and down</a> with glee.<p>Transgaming has a really neat model, by the way, where paying subscribers get to vote on what games the developers will work on. Maybe Mobhunter should do something along these lines. Unhappy mages, monks, wizards, and necros who start sending me envelopes stuffed with cash will find themselves with a new champion!<p><BIG>The Evil That Men Do</BIG><p>Unfortunately, not all citizens of Norrath play nice. A recent message of the day (the yellow text you see when you enter the game) was directed at people <a href="http://macroquest.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=983">using a cheat program</a> to make mad cash off fletching. While EQ has never been as susceptible to the macroing phenomenon as Ultima Online, any use of macroing is troubling. Unlike a passive third-party solution like EQ Windows (which, while technically illegal, does no harm on its own), the MacroQuest program bypasses part of the game. Trade skills are no damn fun, and people should have to suffer through them equally.<p>Another nasty exploit making the rounds is that players have found a way to crash any zone in the game. Blue servers have used this trick to spawn raid targets multiple times, while PvP servers have used it to make enemies vulnerable to attack. Either way you slice it, this is a crappy bug that needs fixing ASAP.<p>After giving the matter some thought, I'm not going to post the steps to do it or link to any threads that explain how--they're out there if you want to look for them. I can assure you that Verant is aware of this problem and is actively taking steps to ban those who are obviously exploiting it. The bug has been fixed for a week on Test, and will be going live with the next patch.<p>Say it with me now: sploiters are weenies, sploiters are weenies, sploiters are weenies...
