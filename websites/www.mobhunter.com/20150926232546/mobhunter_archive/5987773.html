Because of that, the following items from the patch message did not make it Live. <p>- Sentry Rotiart now enacts his role in his quest properly.<br>- Beastlord pets can now be summoned in the Plane of Sky.<br>- The teleporter from the Great Divide to the Plane of Knowledge will now work during Coldain Ring War. <p>We'll patch these zones with the next patch and get these changes out. We're sorry about the error and the delay on these updates.</B><p>Those are hardly gamebreakers, but it did take Absor a while to get this message posted. I think Alan is even more of a slacker than I am. Well, maybe.<p><BIG>Chant We All Just Get Along?</BIG><p>Something not mentioned in the patch message that ticked off more than a few enchanters was the <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=84253">change to the Vengeance of Time focus effect</a>, making it no longer apply to slows and mezes. Chanters are also concerned by <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=84338">further tinkering</a> with their <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=3355&amp;source=Test">Command of Druzzil</a> spell on Test server.<p>The reason the dev team is messing with charm is, of course, that chanters and others who can control PoP mobs are ending up with uber pets that do far more damage than players can, thus allowing the caster to solo mobs that nobody else could. The big downside to nerfing the bread-and-butter abilities of charmers is, of course, that it negatively affects their role on raids as well. Balancing the ability is very, very tricky.<p>Is there a better solution? I dunno. If the goal is to limit the ability of casters to obtain overpowered pets everywhere except raids, then why not make charm spells even tougher to use, but balance this by sticking a charm slot item in game that gives massive benefits to charm and mez spells while the caster is in a group or on a raid? This would make soloing risky and tough like it should be while restoring the usefulness of chanters, necros, and druids in raid situations.<p>I'm just a dumb melee type, but it certainly seems like those charm slot items could be made to work for something useful like this. Hey, if they can make charms that give bonuses when you're solo, why can't they make ones that give you benefits while grouped?<p><BIG>Shadow[bane]s in the Rain</BIG><p>Next week is the release of the long, long, long-promised Shadowbane, supposedly the PvPer's wet dream come true. At least, that's how they billed it about two years ago.<p>Reports from those who have been playing in beta are mixed, leading to a lot of <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=2f88a5ee715157a288456579ae111966&amp;threadid=6120">interesting discussion</a> about the game. Despite some neat screenshots of burned cities, I personally don't see Shadowbane even making a dent in the EQ subscriber base, at least not for very long.<p>Why? Because a fantasy roleplaying game that focuses on PvP for its high-end content puts itself in a nearly impossible situation. Nobody wants to PvP in a persistent world unless he or she can win--and PvP doesn't leave room for a lot of winners. While Shadowbane got the right idea in basically removing levelling from the equation (disparity in levels being one of the main reasons fair PvP in EverQuest is pretty much impossible), they can't change human nature.<p>Some portion of hardcore PvPers fall into the category of griefers, taking pleasure in humiliating their opponents again and again. The presence of griefers makes casual players quit the game. But efforts to limit the abilities of griefers end up weakening the game, driving away many of the devoted fans of the genre. Therefore, what usually happens is you end up with a watered-down environment that doesn't please anyone.<p>Maybe Shadowbane will be the game to overcome this, but it sure doesn't sound like it. Honestly, I don't know if any game can. Maybe persistent worlds and PvP just can't work together, at least not in this stage of gaming's evolution. But I guess the attempt is worthwhile, and Shadowbane seems to be a step in the right direction in a lot of ways.<p>So, more power to them. But I doubt SOE is going to be breaking so much as a sweat on the 25th--although I predict a lot of the staffers will be logging in that day to check it out.<p><BIG>You Can Tune a Piano, But You Can't Tunaria a Fish</BIG><p>I've been playing EQOA a bit here and there in my spare time. It's a fun game--and I mean fun in the sense of having new things to discover without a lot of drudgery. My little Moorgard Jr. has gotten to level 9 so far, after really only a few hours of playtime. Anyway, I thought I'd share some of my observations and adventures. (Part of it relates to regular EQ--I swear!)<p>I started out as a monk, naturally. However, while most of my time is spent punching stuff, the line between melee and caster is not as clearly defined in this game as it is in EQ. Instead of a mana bar that only casting classes have, everybody gets a &quot;power&quot; bar (no, not the energy snack thing). Casters use it just like mana, but melee use power through their special attacks. Even at level 9, Moorgard Jr. already has a bunch of neat kicks and punches that do a whole bunch of damage, but he has to manage his power so that he doesn't run out. This makes even supposedly pure melees into a kind of caster, and it's really a good concept that adds another dimension to class balancing.<p>As I've mentioned before, one of the flaws in EQ is that melee abilities aren't really tied to any kind of limitation, except time. Disciplines and AA abilities give some spell-like powers to melee classes, but the only means of controlling them is through reuse timers. Thus most of the tinkering that happens with melee classes goes on behind the scenes with hidden damage tables, mitigation tables, and so forth, or else by the introduction of new armor and weapons. By linking the damage a class can do with the amount of power it has, EQOA has a whole different means of class balance that should minimize the massive caster/melee inequalities that exist in EQ today.<p>Anyway, like I was saying, EQOA is fun. You start out right away doing quests, and low and behold, you actually want to complete them. The early quests go fast, advancing you a couple levels in a hurry and providing useful items and abilities, all the while teaching you the game interface and what the surrounding area is like.<p>Speaking of the area, it's big. I don't know in terms of virtual square feet how the world compares to EQ, but it feels massive. While you move seamlessly from zone to zone so it seems like you're in one big open area, in fact the world is a 12 x 15 grid. This makes for a possible area of 180 zones, though 27 of those aren't currently in use and some of the others are just open water. The dev team said that some areas of the existing world are currently locked, so the potential for expansion is definitely there. In the meantime, EQ Atlas has a very handy <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/eqoa/index.html">map</a> that can help you navigate the world.<p>So there I am, working on my quests (running around killing fire beetles and badgers and the like), and I'm getting to the point where I need a gnoll paw for my next quest. While I'm on my way to look for gnolls, two younger monks run up and invite me to group. I figure why not, and accept. Immediately they start asking me where fire beetles are, so I take them to a good spot. These guys are whacking beetles like it's going out of style, and you've never seen anyone loot corpses so fast. Literally, these two guys are in a race to see who can get items the fastest or something. They were also keen on me showing them where all the other items they needed could be found, but I was a little tired of not getting any phat lewtz and I really wanted that gnoll paw, so I wandered off and they dropped me from the group.<p>After exploring the labyrinth that is Qeynos (blame Rod Humble for designing that one!), I managed to find a spot for gnolls--two little ones and a named. Yellow cons, but since monks are uber in this game, I could solo the normal one. Woot! About then, the two monks I'd grouped with earlier come running up and attacked the gnolls at my camp, aided by a couple guys who conned red to me. At first I had the normal EQ reaction of WTF!!!, but mobs respawn very quickly in EQOA--as in a couple minutes--so I didn't have a problem  snagging my own targets to kill, even in a camp of only three mobs. A little while later, a higher level guy came around and helped me kill the named, which dropped the paw I needed.<p>My adventures eventually took me to Highbourne, the Erudite city. Running between towns took a while, but monks get a cool sprint ability that helped a bit. Once you get to a new city you can visit the coachman, which kind of &quot;marks&quot; you for that city and lets you return there by visiting the coachman in another city. Think of it kind of like the way portals used to work in Velious--once you travel to the location the first time, you can port back there in the future.<p>So Moorgard Jr. is sitting in Highbourne, waiting for me to log in and get him to level 10. Like I said, the game is pretty cool, and even item decay isn't so bad--yet. A <a href="http://everquestonlineadventures.station.sony.com/content.jsp?page=Producer's%20Letter%20-%20Game%20Updates">producer's letter</a> is up on the official site, detailing some of the changes on the horizon, including the first major client update. If you find yourself wanting to try something a little different, the game is worth checking out. Plus, you can always giggle at the newbies.<p>Hey, it's better than getting yourself into <a href="http://www.internalmemos.com/memos/memodetails.php?memo_id=1409">trouble</a>, right?<br>
