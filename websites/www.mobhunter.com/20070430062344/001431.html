<h1 class="article_title">Two Contests and the Lost Files of Moorgard</h1>
<p>by Loral on October 17, 2005</p>

<p>Last week, in order to test a theory and add a bit of fun, I announced the official Mobhunter Spirit Shroud contest.  Here are the details:</p>

<p>Mobhunter's Spirit Shroud Contest!</p>

<p>Take yourself and five friends, switch to level 70 spirit shrouds of any type, and go defeat the Creator Dragons of Norrath mission.  Send me a single screenshot of you and your five friends in spirit shroud form, an inventory window to show me your level, a /who in your chatbox to show me the level, class, and race of your group's shrouds, and the body of the dead creator.  This should all be in a single screenshot.  Email the screenshot to loral@loralciriclight.com in jpg format.</p>

<p>If you are the first to send me this screenshot, you will win a brand new copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002XL3BA/">God of War</a> for the Playstation 2, this year's best action / adventure game.</p>

<p>Now on to the second contest:</p>

<p>Mobhunter's Red Cross iPod Shuffle Giveaway!</p>

<p>Support for those affected by Hurricane Katrina is still greatly needed.  Visit the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/">Red Cross homepage</a> and donate $20 or more to the Katrina relief effort.  Forward me a copy of your Red Cross donation receipt and your name will go into a raffle for a 1gb iPod Shuffle player.  The shuffle is slightly used but in fine working order. On November 15th 2005, I will have someone draw a name out of a hat filled with all of the $20 or more Red Cross receipts to find a winner for the 1GB iPod Shuffle player.  You may only submit one donation per name and address.</p>

<p>So donate today.  Help those who need our aid and perhaps win a fine mp3 player at the same time.</p>

<p>Now for our last bit of news, the Lost Scrolls of Moorgard!</p>

<p>In the late hours of the evening, when the blackness of of night was absolute, I found myself hunched over my writing table scrawling out this article on sheets of parchment with a large  quill.  A whisper brought my head up from my words, slipping through the ancient halls of Castle Mobhunter.  I picked up my candelabra dripping hot red wax onto the oak table, gathered my monk's robes about me, and with trepidation, followed the strange whisper.</p>

<p>The whisper led deep into the lower vaults of the castle, revealing halls and rooms I had never before seen, halls lost to the current residents of the castle.  The whisper traveled further until it led to a huge oak door banded with steel and marked with a great M.  I pushed on the door and felt an ancient latch break free.  The door swung open.</p>

<p>A room filled with dust and cobwebs held nine large pots.  I lifted the heavy lid off of one of these pots and felt old stale air escape for the first time in centuries.  Inside were sheaves of lambskin bound and tied in thick covers of leather.  I untied it, feeling the twine turn to dust under my fingers, and read the first page.  Suddenly understanding dawned on me.  I had found the <a href="http://mobhunter.com/moorgard/">Lost Scrolls of Moorgard</a>!</p>

<p>From September 25th, 2000 until August 16th 2003, Moorgard wrote over four hundred articles for Mobhunter.  These articles entertained and informed thousands over the years.  They helped steer Everquest into a new age.  Now these articles, once thought lost forever, have been found.</p>

<p>These articles document the history of Everquest from the times of Kunark to the times of the Planes of Power.  Follow Everquest back through its history from the eyes of Everquest's best editorial writer.</p>

<p>I don't recall ever seeing one and I seem to remember that some of the devs felt that the multiple pronounciations were a good thing - it made the words ours.</p>

<p>Actually, I do think I remember seeing a list with at least god names on it.  I was quite surprised that Luclin was pronounced "Luck Lynn".</p>

<p>DoD ended up #9 of the top 20 games for September.  COnsidering that it only cracked the weekly top 10 on its launch week, that's pretty good.  The truly humorous part (to me) is that EQ2's expansion came in at #11...</p>

<p><br />
I read this news from Turbine about "lessons learned with AC2", and I paraphrase since I don’t have the quote at hand:</p>

<p>One thing we learned was how people perceive sequels in MMOs, in single player games these tend to result in great sales, but in MMOs they only tend to split your audience.</p>

<p><br />
I think this is also true for EQ2. I think Moorgard himself (don’t quote me on this) once told if they regretted something it was naming the game EverQuest 2.</p>

<p>Anyway, as proven with AC2 and also with EQ2, the audience of these games tends to be a small subset of the original + the players that were interested on the original but never able to look past the graphics + a random other few.</p>

<p>So I am not surprised that EQII's expansion is selling way less than the EQ:DoD one. </p>

<p>Oh and for the ones living on a cave, Turbine already announced they will stop running AC2 servers, servers will be taken down December 31st at midnight. Doubt this will happen with EQ2, specially since the original game was much larger than AC so a subset of EQ1 is enough to keep the game rolling until it can mature on it's own.</p>

<p>Now, if there was a way for them to get rid of that big 2 on the box with future expansions...<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Maitreya on October 21, 2005 01:04 PM</strong></p>
<p>They really should have called it Everquest: Age of Rebirth or something. Or even just Age of Rebirth and leave EQ out of the name entirely. </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Ogulbuk on October 21, 2005 01:59 PM</strong></p>
<p>Norath: Age of Rebirth would had been perfect, as it keeps relation to the old EQ lore without making it sound as a sequel.</p>

<p>"I think Moorgard himself (don’t quote me on this) once told if they regretted something it was naming the game EverQuest 2."</p>

<p>It was actually John Smedley at the first Everquest Summit.  I have also heard this mentioned by people working on both EQ and EQ2.</p>

<p>"Oh and for the ones living on a cave, Turbine already announced they will stop running AC2 servers, servers will be taken down December 31st at midnight."</p>

<p>That is sad to hear.  I hate to see communities break up because of business decisions.  Does anyone have any estimated population numbers?  It is worth noting what it actually does take to kill a MMO.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: simkine on October 22, 2005 06:45 AM</strong></p>
<p>EQ2 has fewer people playing because it's not that good. Same with AC2. It had eye candy but was a very weak mmorpg.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Maitreya on October 22, 2005 10:58 AM</strong></p>
<p>"Good" seems to be pretty subjective in MMOs. I've heard a lot of people say WoW is the greatest thing they've ever played, but, from what I've seen and heard, I doubt it would hold my interest for very long. On the other hand, there are people who swear they hate EQ with a passion, but I've never loved a computer game this much.</p>

<p>So, just because many people don't like EQ2 doesn't make it bad, as clearly enough people to keep an MMO going think it's good.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Bunion on October 24, 2005 02:42 PM</strong></p>
<p>Loral, </p>

<p> If they had just gone by the numbers AC2 should have been ended long ago, I think turbine just kept it around until one of their new games was closer to release. As for numbers at the end I doubt there was even 10,000 subscribers. What really ticked off the few players of AC2 was they had just released an expansion for it in August. </p>

<p> I played AC2 for awhile and although it had potential, there were just too many poor design decisions. Not to mention what really doomed it was the chat server didn't work for better part of a year. What good is a multiplayer game where you can't even talk to your guild (or as they called it: Allegiance)or even to your group half the time.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on October 25, 2005 01:38 PM</strong></p>
<p>"What really ticked off the few players of AC2 was they had just released an expansion for it in August."</p>

<p>I went over and visited their closing thread.  It made me pretty sad.  To see the core of a community, even a small one, broken up like that was pretty brutal.</p>

<p>A lot of people were upset about paying for the expansion, thinking that the company squeezed out a few drops before tossing the game aside.  That probably wasn't the case.  Expansions do a lot to bring new players and returning players back into the game.  It was probably a last ditch effort to get new players into the game and fund continued uptime.</p>

<p>As far as squeezing it out, expansions run about $30 and we play the hell out of them for about six months (well, some of us do).  Today I'm about to go buy a copy of Metroid Pinball for my Nintendo DS.  I seriously doubt I'll get the same sort of playtime out of Metroid Pinball that I will get out of Depths of Darkhollow.  Even two months with an expansion is usually enough time to justify the cost.</p>

<p>The problem we run into is the idea of "investment" (I wrap it in quotes to keep it off of my shoes).  People think of their time in an MMO as an investment but don't think of the ten hours they spend playing Shadow of the Colossus as the same sort of investment.  When they're done with Shadow, they stick it on a shelf and happily go after the next game.  A game like EQ or WOW, or EQ2 or AC2, however, they expect to be able to play it for six years (and some of us have).  Yes, we pay a monthly fee on top of our $30 for the expansion, but its the cost of two movies and less than the cost of a DVD and we get a LOT more play time out of it than the typical game.</p>

<p>Still, its understandable to see the anger on that forum.  Regardless of the lack of a financial or time investment, people have an emotional investment.  We make friends, set up goals and accomplishments, build up our character.  In most games, we're done when we decide we're done.  In MMOs, some of us will be done when the company yanks the plugs.  That's a disturbing reality for this type of game.</p>

<p>I think what is truely interesting, is that there seems to be some kind of hope amongst the Developers that they can "return" Everquest to the top of the MMO market....</p>

<p>First off, these same developers are the geniuses that brought us unmitigated garbage like Gates of Discord. And despite some of the really interesting things in DoD, they made rewards for much of the events lackluster at best. </p>

<p>This is the development team that is supposed to find ways to bring in new players and encourage older veterans to return?</p>

<p>These jokers are the reason I only have a single account active out of the 5 I used to run. The game is still extremely flat, and lacks much in the way of true dynamics. </p>

<p>The re-envisionments have been nothing more than reaffirments of past views, and design. No class really has underwent a real re-envisionment, no base level changes, nothing that speaks of a true re-envisionment.</p>

<p>I was holding out a signifigant amount of hope that this was just initial staging, and that there was much to come in the process, but with word from the summit, and other sources stating that they feel the re-envisionments are about 70% done, it is clear to me that it is still business as usual.</p>

<p>Everquest the Game will last for a good long time yet, I have little fear that it will follow AC2 any time soon. There's still a very solid player base for the game.</p>

<p>But to dream that it can overcome a sequel syndrome, the next flavor of the month, dated player models, and ancient old world zone graphics, is more than a bit optimistic.</p>

<p>I personally feel they do not have any solid visionaries on staff that could pull it off. Not after seeing how they botched some really cool concepts in DoD.</p>

<p>As long as expansions come out, and have a great initial idea base, but after a week have people taking issue with something as baseline as risk versus reward?</p>

<p>No, I highly doubt Everquest will ever come close to the pinnacle of dominance it held 2-3 years ago as long as the current Dev crew is around.</p>

<p>Absor, Rashere, Brenlo and some of the other lost causes need to be removed before they could ever hope to accomplish that.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Vamirez on October 26, 2005 04:25 AM</strong></p>
<p>I think the time needed to loot your corpse and equip your gear is an interesting game detail. </p>

<p>You all know the following situation: A pull went awry, you died. You think 'Oh my god, now we wipe!' Right after zoning, you type 'Are you alive?? Hello??' A rezz window appears, you click immediately and arrive in a mid-combat situation. It looks critical. You loot your corpse like mad, hoping you will be armed in time and able to return to the fray and help turn the tide of battle before it is too late.</p>

<p>The same mechanisam applies when many people have died in a raid. You see them put their armor on while bitter fighting is going on around them, and I think this actually adds quite a bit to the situation - increased tension and increased difficulty (the situation has to be endured longer before rezzed people can help again).</p>

<p>I don't think the argumentation that its too much to right-click your thirty items does stand up against that. It reasonably takes a moment to reequip all your stuff. Removing details such as this imho make a game more bland.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: bleh on October 26, 2005 12:09 PM</strong></p>
<p>The main thing(s) that sucks about manually looting every item is, lag... it can take alot longer for someone who is lagged to loot their equipment, in extrememe cases its taken me 2+ minutes to fully loot a corpse.</p>

<p>b) related to the lag, but more about game's current mouse implemntation is just shitty. Thankfully, eq will very soon implement the standard windows cursor and make this particular frustration much less frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on October 26, 2005 03:59 PM</strong></p>
<p>I think people should respawn with all of their gear already on them.  Gear-loss only really effects mid-level players and it effects them far more and in a far worse manner than anything at the high end.</p>

<p>No game should get easier the further it goes along.</p>

<p>Players should respawn with their gear but a 15 minute death effect that does all but paralyze them.  A res will replace this with res sickness which isn't quite as severe.  Bodies are always naked, last 3 hours, and can recover experience when ressed.</p>

<p>I have no data to support it, but I think that the naked death of Everquest sets it far behind Warcraft, EQ2, and other competitive MMOs in the eyes of new players.  It can be easily fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Sunshadow on October 26, 2005 07:13 PM</strong></p>
<p>Yuck, what a horrible Idea. 15min of paralization(or something near it) would kill EQ. At least now I can "do stuff" when I die even if it is only run back to my corpse. If I dad to wait 15 min the words Boring, snore , snore pop into my head. It would end up if you died and there was no rez arround, people would just log off. I get frustrated when I crash and it take the server 5 min to let me back on (this is a problem that really pisses me off by the way). If I am to be hampered of 15 min I can see anger happening.</p>

<p>Death in todays game has been trivialised way to much IMHO. The 90+% rezzes, Clicky rezzes, guild lobby, automatic corpse summon to ZI, monster missions, Veteran AA all make death a trivial thing. If things keep on the way they are soon when you die you'll reappear at the zone safe point with full health, mana and equipment.</p>

<p>The challenge of doing things without dieing is gone. As a result the encounters have gotten harder to compensate. </p>

<p>If all those aids were suddenly removed from the game and the highest rez was only 50%, would we view our encounters differently? Would the game suddenly be more challenging? </p>

<p>.. </p>

<p>Yes, the game would get more challenging.. challenging finding a group that would want you :) as everyone would only be grouping with people they know would not cause a death. heck that already happens to a extent, if you were to penalize people even more for a death they would abandon any and all pick ups.</p>

<p>It might be true that new players would prefer a game that is the least mean to them when their character dies. The problem is, in my opinion, a good game has to be mean. It has to be difficult to master. Quite some people who had left my guild to play WoW have since come back, stating that its too easy, it gets boring fast. Some coming back from EQ2 said its lacking complexity in comparison to its predecessor. An interesting challenge does not only come from encounter difficulty but also from the game system and its little details. I wouldn't like to have EQ's peculiarities all smoothened away - I don't want to play on "I'm too young to die", I want to play on "Ultra-Violence" ;-)</p>

<p>I also dont think we need to retain our gear after death. Death in eq is supposed to be an inconvenience and it is quite easy to now retrieve your corpse via the guild lobby. If you want something that will help after deaths its a 'loot all key' for raids would be helpful and a method to increase endurance for Melee who depend on this for discs.</p>

<p>"15min of paralization(or something near it) would kill EQ. At least now I can "do stuff" when I die even if it is only run back to my corpse....Death in todays game has been trivialised way to much IMHO."</p>

<p>My idea is to shift the the disadvantage of death to one that effects everyone, not just the level 10 to 40 folks.</p>

<p>When I say paralyze, I mean basically that death effected players are unable to get back into combat unless they are ressed for about 10 to 15 minutes.  This is your disadvantage for dying but one that equally effects players from level 11 to level 50 without making people feel like they lost their gear.</p>

<p>The psychological effect of losing your gear is a much stronger penalty for death at the low levels than at the high.  Being unable to get your gear or your experience back because you don't know a cleric and your gear is stuck in the giant fort of Frontier Mountains at level 25 and you don't want to buy Dragons of Norrath just for a corpse alter (or you have but you didn't know about the alter), those things can kill a game for people.</p>

<p>I want to see them replace gear loss with another death penalty that ubers can't just walk away form while level 30s have to struggle.</p>

<p>Here was a post on the character model thing.  It is important to note that the EQ2 player models weren't paid for by SOE but by an off-shore group as part of EQ2's internationalization.  The immediate feelings of "OMG, EQ2 got new player models but EQ didn't!" aren't exactly accurate here.</p>

<p>"Well actually these models were in development with our partners in Asia for some time. They are the Soga character models that they developed for their market, we were able to adapt them into the current US version of the game so that's where it stands now and why your seeing the Soga models added. -  Raijinn"</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Sunshadow on October 27, 2005 09:17 PM</strong></p>
<p>It is the dieing in the middle of the giant fort at level 25 that was good for the game. I will explain. There is more than 1 one way to get a corpse which everyone seems to have forgotten.</p>

<p>1) Monks can FD drag.<br />
2) Casters can Invis drag.<br />
3) Necros can summon.<br />
4) Invis potion drag.<br />
5) Rogues can sneak/hide.</p>

<p>So if a level 25 you can't do any of these things then you ask for help. IE cultivate friends. </p>

<p>By making everything "easy", the need for player interaction has decreased by a massive amount. We don't need the game dumbed down any more otherwise all these cool abilities we have just go to waste. I cannot remember the last time someone asked me for a corpse summon or the last time I used it on myself even. With the veteren AA's I rarely even need my EE's unless I'm working out a new Kite spot. </p>

<p>Would a max 50% rez make getting groups harder I doubt it. However if you currently restrict yourself to MPG and harder groups then yes it will be a problem but then people will likely be more skilled. </p>

<p>"There is more than 1 one way to get a corpse which everyone seems to have forgotten."</p>

<p>But we weren't talking about "everyone" now were we, we were talking about first time lvl 25 players who aren't probably even aware that rezzes are something you can even do. I wouldn't be surprised if at lvl 25 even the classes you mentioned were even aware they could do such things. </p>

<p>Heck, even just having a bard >>find a corpse&lt;&lt; was a big deal when I first got the song. There were n00bs all over Greater Faydark who were forever losing them. </p>

<p>That's my point.  As a level 70 cleric I didn't think twice about running around in Dreadspire until I was killed by nasty horrible things.  I ran over to the corpse alter, summoned my body, ressed myself and off I went.  I lost 4% of the experience and about 160 plat.</p>

<p>Percentage based resurrections mixed with the higher skills of monks and rogues make corpse recovery much easier at higher levels than at lower ones.  If anything, death should get worse at the higher levels than it does at the low.</p>

<p>I think replacing equipment loss with a new death effect is a good compromise.<br />
