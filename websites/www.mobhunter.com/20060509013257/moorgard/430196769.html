Pets basically treat mesmerized NPCs as if they were dead<br>- Pets are neutral to NPCs.  Monsters will not attack pets first unless the pet is being aggressive to something<br>- Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature if no player does damage to that creature<br>- Pets take ZERO experience from a creature unless no player does damage to that creature<br>- The exception to the above rule is Dire Charmed pets, which will take a share of the experience scaled by the amount of damage they do.  In most situations (with an active party, for example) the Dire Charmed pet will not take experience.  Like all pets, they will take 75% of the experience if no PC does damage to the target.  As long as a player does damage to a creature, a Dire Charmed pet will never take more experience than it used to. <p>- Charmed NPCs will now respond to the /pet report health command - /pet sit down command should now work on charmed NPCs<br>- Fixed a bug that was preventing reclaim energy from working on Magician Epic pets.<p>** Miscellaneous **<p>- Fixed a bug that was causing a person that logs out with &quot;damage shields: OFF&quot; to be unable to see damage shield even when they turned them back on<br>- Fixed a problem that was causing crashes when /following someone on a horse if they went out of range<br>- Fixed a bug that prevented targeting an invisible NPC from horseback, even with See Invisible</B><p>Most of the big stuff in this patch was anticipated for the last week or so, while some bug and quest fixes are of course welcome. Tradeskills get the changes that have been in place on Test server for a couple weeks now, which meanst the folks at EQ Traders will have to come up with new roadmaps for skill gains.<p>As ever, if you find any surprise changes, <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">let us know</a> or post them below.<p><BIG>Acrylia Under Construction</BIG><p>Absor stopped over at Dev Corner to provide more detail on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000593.html">change</a> to the Acrylia Caverns zone--specifically, with the boss mob:<p><B>We just wanted to give you all a heads up about a temporary change we'll be making tonight in Acrylia Caverns.<p>The team is in the middle of revamping the final encounter in this zone. The first step in the change is an update to the difficulty of the final encounter to bring it up to where we'd like it to be. That part is mostly complete.<p>The second part is updating the treasure for the encounter to be in line with the new challenge. That part is not finished yet.<p>Because we are doing a 'full data' patch tonight, the changes already made to this encounter will go Live. That would mean more work for the same reward.<p>Since a lot of people don't read here, and some folks don't read patch messages (shame on you), we were worried that players would run through the more difficult encounter and be a bit upset at the rewards. So we're sending the Chieftain on a bit of a vacation until we get the retune completed. This will give us the time to make sure we've got it right and so that we can tune it without rushing the process.</B><p>I don't think Absor really needed to worry about it. Ever since the final boss in Acrylia--Tashakhi--was <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=801535420">slain by Ring of Valor</a> and the loots sux0red, I doubt anyone has gone through all the trouble of tackling 50 Grimling wars to outfit their guild with keys. RoV seems to have <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fringofvalor44669frm33.showMessage?topicID=130.topic">gone back</a> several more times to kill Tak (and if you had done all that work, why wouldn't you), and despite some okay drops the loot still ain't there yet.<p>Hopefully when the entire encounter is tuned, Acrylia will offer a real alternative for upper-end guilds, but it seems like this is still a patch or two away. It's probably taking so long because the gentleman who designed most of inner Acrylia has become a designer at Sigil--Brad McQuaid's new joint.<p><BIG>Breakdown of Pet Exp Changes</BIG><p>Rich Waters, EQ's Lead Designer, passed Absor a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000594.html">clarification</a> of the changes to how pets affect experience awarded, and Alan passed them along to us. It's a really long post, but the crux of it is this:<p><B>With the new rules, players get more experience than they used to with a pet in almost every situation. The only way you can get less than before is if you or your group don't damage a monster. As long as you do any damage at all, your pet will never take the 75% experience share. Make sure you do a bit of damage, and your summoned or regular charmed pets won't take a single point of experience.<p>For Dire charmed pets it's better also - If you do half the damage to a monster, the Dire Charmed pet takes no experience. If you do less than half, your pet takes as little as 25% of the experience when it used to always take half. It can still take up to half the experience if you don't do much damage, but if you're contributing to the damage you'll get more than you used to.</B><p>Makes me wish Nagafen still dropped the item that let any class summon a level 49 necro pet. Ah, the fun me and my skelly friend could've had together.
