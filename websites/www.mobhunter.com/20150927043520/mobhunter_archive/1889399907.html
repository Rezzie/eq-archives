The first step in the change is an update to the difficulty of the final encounter to bring it up to where we'd like it to be. That part is mostly complete.<p>The second part is updating the treasure for the encounter to be in line with the new challenge. That part is not finished yet.<p>Because we are doing a 'full data' patch tonight, the changes already made to this encounter will go Live. That would mean more work for the same reward.<p>Since a lot of people don't read here, and some folks don't read patch messages (shame on you), we were worried that players would run through the more difficult encounter and be a bit upset at the rewards. So we're sending the Chieftain on a bit of a vacation until we get the retune completed. This will give us the time to make sure we've got it right and so that we can tune it without rushing the process.</B><p>I don't think Absor really needed to worry about it. Ever since the final boss in Acrylia--Tashakhi--was <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=801535420">slain by Ring of Valor</a> and the loots sux0red, I doubt anyone has gone through all the trouble of tackling 50 Grimling wars to outfit their guild with keys. RoV seems to have <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fringofvalor44669frm33.showMessage?topicID=130.topic">gone back</a> several more times to kill Tak (and if you had done all that work, why wouldn't you), and despite some okay drops the loot still ain't there yet.<p>Hopefully when the entire encounter is tuned, Acrylia will offer a real alternative for upper-end guilds, but it seems like this is still a patch or two away. It's probably taking so long because the gentleman who designed most of inner Acrylia has become a designer at Sigil--Brad McQuaid's new joint.<p><BIG>Breakdown of Pet Exp Changes</BIG><p>Rich Waters, EQ's Lead Designer, passed Absor a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000594.html">clarification</a> of the changes to how pets affect experience awarded, and Alan passed them along to us. It's a really long post, but the crux of it is this:<p><B>With the new rules, players get more experience than they used to with a pet in almost every situation. The only way you can get less than before is if you or your group don't damage a monster. As long as you do any damage at all, your pet will never take the 75% experience share. Make sure you do a bit of damage, and your summoned or regular charmed pets won't take a single point of experience.<p>For Dire charmed pets it's better also - If you do half the damage to a monster, the Dire Charmed pet takes no experience. If you do less than half, your pet takes as little as 25% of the experience when it used to always take half. It can still take up to half the experience if you don't do much damage, but if you're contributing to the damage you'll get more than you used to.</B><p>Makes me with Nagafen still dropped the item that let any class summon a level 49 necro pet. Ah, the fun me and my skelly friend could have together.
