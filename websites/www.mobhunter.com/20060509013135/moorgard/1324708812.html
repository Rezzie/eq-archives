This did not affect warriors<p>- We think we've fixed many of the issues that were causing 1018 errors.  At the very worst players should be able to log back in faster now <p>- Fixed a problem that was causing quests to give no Alternate Experience to a character when that character had all experience going into their Alternate Experience pool<p>- Fixed a bug that was causing Claw of the Savage Spirit, Earthen Band and Breastplate of Day to show a negative statistic modifier<p>- Fixed an issue with some ATI-based video cards that was causing the inventory screen to flash<p>- All Levitation spells will now be stripped when entering a no-levitation zone.  There was a bug that caused the game to only strip the first Levitation spell found<p>- Earrings of Endless Speed are now no-drop<p>- Fixed a bug that was displaying erroneous and duplicate faction messages<p>- Also added some Tradeskill recipes for items dropping in Akheva and Maidens eye<p>- Tradeskills (including Alchemy and poison) now take %skill modifying items and buffs into consideration<p>- Scallywag's Arm Plates (Legends Only) are now wearable in the arms slot (was errantly flagged for the chest slot)<p>- All soft wicker pieces are now wearable by Beastlords<p>** A Tale **<p>Prime Heirophant Vek leaned over and looked into the jeweled case silently.  The young mystic behind him nervously fingered the cudgel hanging from his belt.  He knew what was coming.  The hold of the faceless had firmly taken hold of his heart and was beginning to squeeze.<p>Vek turned to him quietly and simply said, &quot;Find them.&quot;  He then walked silently out of the room.<p>Hierophant Zand turned to the young Mystic, &quot;Do as he has asked.  Do not return until you have the skulls of the ancients in your possession.&quot;  The young Mystic stumbled as he ran out of the room, visibly shaking.<p>Zand looked down into the empty skull case.  Something glittered softly in the corner of the case.  Zand reached in and picked up a small earring, emblazoned with the symbol of the Kunzar.<p>Zand walked quietly out of the room, and somewhere the soul of a dead emperor laughed with unholy malice.<p>** Another Tale **<p>Halor slashed frantically at the creature before him.  He swung down hard, cleaving the great worm in two.  Unfortunately there were many more were [sic] that came from.  Bauric climbed over a rock and stood next to Halor, fighting off another of the worms.<p>Halor suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right heel and spun violently around, causing his journals to fly out of his pack and onto the hard stone floor.  He swung at the worm larva with his sword knocking it away, but too late.  The worm had wounded him badly, he could no longer hold himself up on the wounded ankle and he fell to the floor with a crash.  Bauric cried out in pain as one of the larger worms bit into his arm.  That was the last thing Halor saw before the horde of worms squirmed across the stones and overcame them.<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>Ah, more little stories to puzzle over. The first bit mentions Cazic-Thule and the Iksar, so it most likely has to do with the update to the CT Temple zone that you downloaded with the patch. A gorilla now guards the entrance, and the lizardmen are much higher level. We'll report other changes as we hear of them. The second story has something to do with Vex Thal. Hey, maybe players can actually see the zone now...<p>Most of the bug fixes are quite welcome. While supposedly not game threatening, the faction message bug was getting quite annoying--especially if you parse that sort of thing. Those 1018 errors were really, really aggravating, so let's hope they actually fixed them. Tradeskills saw some additions and improvements, which I'm sure the folks at <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/">EQ Traders</a> are already delving into.<p>The spdat file was updated, and once again Remelio Gemweaver from the Tarew Marr server has provided us with a report:<p><B><I>New Spells:</I><p>Non-Player effects:<br>- 5 point-blank AOE spells named &quot;Shadow Warding&quot; were added--these port you to a location within Vex Thal.<br>- Spell named Kaggy's Curse added.. if you run into a frogloc named Kaggy you're in for some hurtin'... snare/dot/slow and very hard to resist.. on the up side looks like a dash of cure poison will take it right away<br>- A weird polymorph spell added, stuns you, illusions you, takes off 100hp, and decreases your int/wis by 40 and saps some mana (possibly an un-clarity) from the message it gives I'm guessing it turns you into one of those Neanderthal guys<br>- AOE blind/stun/250hp damage (very hard to resist)--probably added to something in Umbral Plains by the spell name and effect wording<br>- Carnage: Mini-avitar 40str 40dex 40atk 40 agi - even left the emerald as a reagent line in - maybe they're thinking of giving shimmies a lower level form of avatar?  Just guessing on this one, keep in mind that no classes are listed as being able to use so this might just be an item effect<br>         <br><I>Modified Spells:</I><p>Non-Player Effects:<br>- Cazic's Gift, that 1000hp heal I mentioned last time was fiddled with a tiny bit, looks like they changed the way it stacks or something--probably an effect on something since they are fiddling with it<br>- Blood Bath - Changed from a lifetap to a 150hp in 7.5 min regen, 5 ac 25 atk buff (sounds like a weapon proc but I couldn't find any listed)<br>- A test spell was changed that nobody will ever notice ;)<br>- Shrieker's Curse and Sun Revenant's Curse are now not curses, so remove curse won't work against them anymore.  They're tagged as harder to resist than a normal spell, but I think curses always worked like that anyway.  Both still check vs Disease, but no disease counters are added, so remove disease probably won't work still, you'll just have to wait for them to wear off.<br>         <br>Player Spells (the good stuff!):<br>- Arch Lich (60 NEC) - Ultravision added<br>- Glamour of Kintaz - Mana cost reduced from 275 to 175 (hurray!)</B><p>Thanks again, Remelio. Necros and enchanters will be pleased, at least--as will whatever mobs got some new tricks up their sleeves.<p><BIG>Come Out, Come Out, Wher-e-Vulak You Are</BIG><p>A couple days ago <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">Casters Realm</a> reported the following conversation with Absor:<p><B>The NPCs in the event are not giving rewards at this time, and this is intentional. If they did, people would simply farm this event for the loot, and that is not the intent. <p>At some point, the later bosses may give minor rewards, but dont expect anything on par with actual dragon loot. Your reward for winning this is getting a shot at Vulak. Yes, there I spoiled it, but let people know, Vulak does indeed still exist within the Temple of Veeshan.</B><p>This message puts an end to some speculation, but nonetheless breeds <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=10113.topic">discussion</a>. Yes, the Vulak loot is there, but it takes a hell of a lot of effort to get to it. I'd imagine some guilds that have been in NToV for months will simply decide that the effort isn't worth the time investment, even given Vulak's insane drops. Those who aren't so well equipped will just have to suffer through the waves of nasty mobs--if they can manage it--to get their phat lewtz.<p>The bigger issue is what the deal is with all these Ring of Fire-type events. Waves of mobs in the Coldain Ring War was a cool idea, but it has been so overdone in Luclin that it borders on cumbersome. There's the Acrylia ring itself, the big worm in the Deep, caller quests in Fungus Grove, and even lower-level versions in places like Grimling Forest. Rumor has it that something similar is included in the CT revamp, perhaps to spawn an upgraded Avatar of Fear.<p>While the ring idea is great when used sparingly, it gets old when it's applied as a means to spice up old content that wasn't broken to begin with. That's the case in NToV, and while it's unlikely to be changed back. let's hope that Verant doesn't go hog wild and change a whole bunch of existing zones. Methinks making Emperor Crush a triggered spawn wouldn't be well received by the citizens of the Faydark.<p><BIG>Yet Another Good-bye</BIG><p>A site called unknownplayer.com is <a href="http://www.unknownplayer.com/archive/02/03/04/391.php">reporting</a> that Kelly Flock, the CEO of Verant, has joined the ranks of those who have hit the road. Here is the official press release:<p><B>Kelly Flock has moved on to pursue independent business opportunities. Since its founding in 1995, Sony Online Entertainment has become the number one online games publisher, currently dominating the online subscription gaming segment. The management team of Sony Online Entertainment will continue to ensure the highest degree of quality in current and future game developments and customer satisfaction. John Smedley, Chief Operating Officer of Sony Online Entertainment, will manage the company and report to Yair Landau, President, Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment. &quot;We have a very strong senior management team here at SOE&quot;, says Yair Landau, President, Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment. &quot; I am very confident in SOE's continued success&quot;. Day to day operations, creative innovation and development continue unchanged. The development teams at Sony Online Entertainment continue to expand the growing world of EverQuest and branch out to new genres with Star Wars Galaxies and PlanetSide.</B><p>McQuaid, Butler, Kendrick... and now Flock. Well, at least Kelly won't have us pesky customers around to <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=1792188523">fuck him up</a> anymore (sorry, we just can't let that infamous quote go). To say that Verant has seen some changes lately is an understatement. Where doth The Vision (TM) lie? Smed holds the reigns, and Abashi has no small amount of influence now. What lies ahead for our beloved game? As the roster of recognizable names continues to shrink, Mobhunter will try to keep you up to date on events in the Verantdome.<p><BIG>A Kind of Mage-ick</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000511.html">continued his discussion</a> on mage issues, which continued to make my head hurt. Honestly, these are important topics for a class that has sort of fallen through the cracks as of late, and we're glad to see them addressed. But if I try to read this thread, I get a pounding sensation in my temples and little black spots start to cloud my vision. So I think in this case we'll just let Absor and the mages sort it all out, and I can go on living my happy life hitting stuff and playing dead.<p>
