Despite the volatile topic and guest caller, the story was handled reasonably well.<p>Then my wife gets home from work last night and informs me that we have to watch the channel 5 news at 10pm because they're doing a story on EverQuest addiction. I winced visibly, fearing the worst, most one-sided coverage imaginable. And sadly, my fears were justified.<p>Check out this <a href="http://www.kstp.com/article/view/10785/">summary</a> of the piece, only imagine it being delivered in serious, on-the-brink-of-tragedy tones by doe-eyed anchor Julie Nelson. Notice the section on Woolley's suicide. Hmm, there doesn't seem to be any mention of his <B>mental illness</B> or health problems like, oh, <B>epilepsy</B>. No, good old KSTP was content to simply flash the image of mommy holding up the picture of her deceased son. I guess they were assuming the picture was worth a thousand words--or a few accurate facts.<p>Notice the station's <a href="http://www.kstp.com/article/view/10004/">earlier story</a> on the suicide. It doesn't seem to mention mental illness, either. Notice the first line: <I>Shawn Woolley's addiction to an online computer game contributed to his suicide.</I> The point isn't clarified until the next paragraph--a sure sign of poorly written, deliberately sensational journalism. It's as if I began a story like this:<p><B>EverQuest improves the mental health of its players and helps prevent suicide.<p>That's what statistics from a paper published by the National Institue of Mental Health seem to indicate.</B><p>Notice the trick? I grab your attention with what seems like a fact, then cover my ass carefully down below. And if you look at the <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/harmaway.cfm">story</a> I'm talking about, you can see how I draw that conclusion. According to the NIMH, &quot;10.6 out of every 100,000 persons died by suicide&quot; in 1997. EverQuest has over 450,000 subscribers. That means, on average, about 47 players should kill themselves this year. Yet only one has. That means EverQuest must prevent suicides. Verant will be so happy to hear this news!<p>Of course, such a statement is presumptuous and inaccurate. But if I'm a TV station that's only after higher ratings, I don't really care about the accuracy of my headline, because I'm not the one saying it. I'm simply <I>reporting</I> the news, not making it. Right?<p>Yeah, technically, that's reporting. But it's <B>not accurate</B>, it's <B>not fair</B>, and it's <B>not responsible</B>. It's biased crap.<p>The vast majority of gamers depicted in the story were actually playing Quake and other first-person shooter games, though they did actually show a bit of EverQuest. A character was walking around in West Freeport, so most likely the station bought the game and created a noob so they could shoot some footage. But that's just an assumption on my part rather than a verified fact--not that the TV station would know the difference between those concepts.<p>How much of an attempt did the station make to tell the other side of the story? Very little. Even the people who tried to portray EverQuest as not being something evil came off as suspect:<p><B>Lee: &quot;It's just another video game that's all it is.&quot;&nbsp; <br>Reporter: &quot;But you have been addicted to this.&quot;<br>Lee: (smiles) &quot;I can quit anytime.&quot;</B><p>An astute viewer of the news segment would probably realize the person interviewed was being deliberately ironic. But someone who had bought into the story's attempt to panic viewers would likely be led to say &quot;See! He's an addict and he can't admit it!&quot;<p>I'm extremely disappointed in the obvious abandonment of any degree of fair or balanced reporting on the part of KSTP-TV, and I'm going to let them know it. I'm going to send them an <a href="mailto:9and10pmnews@kstp.com">e-mail</a> (there are separate addresses for <a href="mailto:management@kstp.com">management</a> and <a href="mailto:dhansen@kstp.com">comments on the site</a>, which you might want to cc:), and I encourage you to do the same. I will let them know a bit of the truth about the vast majority of EverQuest players--how we are ordinary people with a hobby that happens to involve a computer game. And I'm going to see if they have the guts to talk to me and actually present a fair, balanced story.<p>Somehow, though, I doubt they will. A normal, healthy, happy guy doesn't generate as much buzz as a mentally ill suicide case, and asking people to accept responsibility for their own weaknesses and flaws doesn't draw as many viewers as blaming it all on a video game. It's up to KSTP-TV to prove that accuracy means more to them than ratings.<p>Contact information, if you want to do more than e-mail:<p>KSTP-Television<br>3415 University Ave.<br>Saint Paul, MN 55114-2099<p>Switchboard: (651) 646-5555<br>Newsroom phone: (612) 5TV-NEWS (612-588-6397)<br>Newsroom fax: (651) 642-4409
