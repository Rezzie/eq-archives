Driven by hunger, they rise from their cursed tombs. Beware! An EQ Halloween is here!</b><p>The EQLive site has been updated with this ominous warning.<p><b>Boo!<p>To celebrate Halloween on Norrath, GMs and Guides will be running some spooky events across the servers.<p>Keep your eyes peeled for storytellers, tricks and treats, miscellaneous mayhem, and those ever pesky undead uprisings.<p>Walk carefully, and carry a big sword. You may just need it!<br></b><p>The tradition continues as Verant will once again run a series of Halloween events across all servers.<p><BIG>Trick or Treat?</BIG><p><b>October 31, 2002  3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>- Fixed a bug that was causing people to crash when certain text was sent.<p>- Spell drops were updated in the first two tier Planes of Power zones.<p>- Classes with 61+ level spells from other expansions will find they no longer receive these spells as rewards for turning in scrolls in the Plane of Knowledge.  Spells that can be purchased will no longer be given as rewards either.<p>- Updated several spells that classes should have been able to use but couldn't.  Also removed a few no rent and no drop flags from some spells.<p>- Anizok Maximizing Device and Anizok Minimizing Device can now be recharged via class-6 manabattery.<p>- Anizok Gauze Press changed to have 20 charges, rechargeable via class-1 manabattery.<p>- Addressed issues with Thelin Poxbourne hedge maze event.<p>- The combination for Greasy Diamond of Innovation has been fixed.<p>- If you helped Grimror and are uncertain what to do next you may glean some knowledge through Identify.<p>- Technique of Master Wu should no longer give a &quot;You can't hit them from here&quot; message when using flying kick or eagle strike.<p>- Wembly in the Plane of Storms should be more willing to talk to people.<p>- Also note, the volume of information in the Bazaar window has increased with the new search feature added on the 25th.  If you can't see the FIND button, you can stretch the window by clicking and dragging the lower right corner of the window.</b><p>A few bug fixes and several quest fixes.  The most notable treat being dropped in our bags is presumably a more liberal disribution of spell drops in first and second tier zones of Planes of Power.<p>There was one little trick conspicuously absent from the patch message candy bowl...<p><BIG>A Slap on the Fists</BIG><p><b>Monk fists will be 15/20 weapons at level 65. For the gain of five relatively short levels, this is a very reasonable upgrade from the 14/26 fists of level 60 monks. As most monks at level 60 have their epics, the upgrade from 9/16 to 15/20 is generally more accurate, and also fairly significant. When we looked at the damage numbers tonight, it showed that leaving monk fists as 18/20 weapons raised unarmed damage output by more than double, just for gaining five levels.</b><p>Jahaar (aka Rich Waters) <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=33867.topic">goes on to justify</a> this change.<p>It was only a couple days ago that news broke about monk fists being approximately 18/20 at level 65. In the midst of the thread discussing this discover, Absor <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=33809.topic&amp;start=203&amp;stop=203">dropped a bomb</a> on monks that caused much unhappiness:<p><B>We're going to have to change this a bit with the next patch. We'll be reducing the power of the monk fist somewhat. It's just not going to work out as it is, it's just too good - the improvement is too dramatic over the level range and for the 'effort' required to get this 'weapon'.<p>Obviously we don't want to bring you more news like this, but this much of an improvement just wasn't intended.<p>Alan</B><p>Outcry was immediate and extreme, as some frustrated monks announced they were quitting the game while others made thinly veiled threats of physical violence against Absor himself. Plus, there were lots of naughty words. Lots and lots of them.  It's still unclear if this nerf actually made it into today's patch as the text does not specifically mention it.<p>Now remember, the fact that level 65 fists were this good was only made public a couple days ago, and the vast majority of monks said they'd never use the fists anyway due to the stats they'd have to give up to do so. But despite all this, and the fact that very few monks are level 65 now and there was nobody who even claimed to be using their bare fists, monks started bitching up a storm.<p>Granted, it's been a tough time for monks lately. The change to the monk defensive table hurt a lot of the class, albeit mostly on an emotional level. Still, many could accept that change for the good of the game. But now a change to the monk's most primal weapon--their fists--seems to contradict the notion that monks are supposed to be the masters of toe-to-toe melee. Thus, even though no monks really were going to use their bare fists, they wanted to know that they <I>could</I> if they wanted to.<p>Combine the defensive nerf, this offensive nerf, and the change to the gnomish bandage summoning device, and some monks feel like their backs are against the wall. Or, perhaps more accurately, that their backsides are at the mercy of the Verant nerfstick.<p>Look, I've played a monk for over three years. By no way, shape, or form are we a neglected class. In our current form we have a ton of power balanced by certain disadvantages, but none so oppressive that we are useless. Plus, it's a very fun class to play.<p>So is all this fair? Well, maybe, because 18/20 weapons are pretty damn nice to be getting for free. But so few monks would use their fists in this form that to nerf them seems almost cruel. The very same logic that made the nerf to the paladin's Slay Undead skill unnecessary applies in this case as well. Once again, non-uber monks are being made to suffer because the top 3% of the class is unbalanced.<p>There's no question that the defensive nerf hurt non-uber monks while having virtually no effect on those it was designed for. Clearly a better option would have been to start by nerfing the AC on some of the monk-usable high-end gear (like the 60 AC legs from AoW) and then assessing how much the defensive table really needed to be changed.<p>If Verant really wants to be nice to monks, they should leave the 65 fists as-is, leave the gauze press alone (for the sake of other melee as well), reevaluate the defensive changes by focussing on equipment first, and make the monk epic usable from the range slot. <p>But even if none of these things were done, monks still don't have it so bad that they need to whine to the extent that they are right now. Hey, 15/20 weapons are still damn good, are are equivalent in damage/delay to the free upgrade that primal and priceless weapons got in the great melee balancing act of last year. Monks are still an awesome class, far away from the &quot;bastard stepchild&quot; that some members of the class would have you believe.<p>
