Drow) last night and got some info about the Sleeper's awakening and the aftermath. Brace yourselves:<p><b>After Blood of the Spider killed the final Warder guarding the Sleeper Kerafyrm, the following events happened:<p>1. Kerafyrm(The Sleeper) spawns and proceeds to own every living thing in the zone. (Actually it was 2 Sleepers, linked together and following same pathing almost exactly, a known EQ bug)<p>2. Kerafyrm appears in Skyshrine zone and repeats the same behavior (not a bugged spawn this time), killing MASS bewildered players in the process.<p>3. Several zones crash, scattered Kerafyrm sightings were reported in each of these zones but are as yet unconfirmed.<p>4. Several mobs in Western Wastes exhibited strange pathing before that zone crashed.<p>5. Nagafen spawned in his lair, but according to players in the zone he had nothing to say about the matter.<p>There were no server wide messages, no dialog between the different dragons, nothing special at all unless you count the piles of newbie corpses in Skyshrine. <p>Speculation is that the &quot;Epic&quot; event, which has been so closely guarded by Verant and reported to be working as intended, is either non-functional or just extremely dissapointing.<p>Seolta the Strategist<br>Blood of the Spider<br>The Rathe Server</B><p>And that's it. Folks, we are in <i>desperate</i> need of some official word from Verant on what happened.<p>Or is it just me? Most EQ sites aren't paying much attention to this story, but the Mobhunter staff is pretty darn interested. Are we nuts? Are our expectations too high? Are we placing too much significance upon this whole event?<p>Discuss how crazy we are with your fellow Mobhunter readers by clicking the &quot;Reply to This Article&quot; link below.<br>
