<p>It only took seven years (five if you count from Luclin) but we finally got our new player models.</p>

<p>What were they thinking? That it might be 'fun'? It is not a joke, it is not fun, it is sadistic. What were they thinking? That people that only get to play on the weekend might enjoy a little time off from EQ? There was a system wide message at about 10:30 pm on Saturday telling people to log out and re-patch immediately if they couldn't read the system wide message completely. I did so and came back to find that my camp had been taken and I was playing a red stick figure in an 'immersive' video game. A joke is when everyone laughs and thinks that it was funny and has a good time. I laughed when I realized that that they had gotten me ... but then the game was no fun to play in that state and there was no way to fix it and realized that this was not going to be an enjoyable everquest weekend.</p>

<p>This is one of the most idiotic things I have ever seen from the Sony corporation. I already look at brands other than sony when I shop due to my EQ experiences. I suggest others do the same if your unhappy. </p>

<p>Now let the Sony apologists start in. Have a good day.</p>

<p>Everyone I talked to or saw in chats seemed to think it is very funny April Fool joke!!  (once they got over the surprise of a backward message and finding themselves a red stick).</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Sabeth on April  1, 2007 04:31 PM</strong></p>
<p>I don't mind a practical joke or April fools day prank from a friend. I like that in fact. Sony is not my friend, if I was to stop paying them they would cancel my accounts in a heartbeat. I pay them for a service, just like I pay my insurance company or bank. My insurance company and bank do not play April fools jokes on me. Everquest is an immersive role playing game, red stick figures are not immersive. If the service was free they could do what they want. It is not free. I pay for a service and expect to get what I paid for. This is not what I paid for. The game is not enjoyable to me in this state. If they had provided a fix after the 'joke' that would have been another thing but the only solution is to 'deal with it' for half of a weekend. This is not acceptable.</p>

<p>I think they should leave it selectable as an option to choose when doing heavy raiding.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: RosesAreRed on April  1, 2007 11:12 PM</strong></p>
<p>Agreed.  It should be a reversible joke.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Aarkan on April  1, 2007 11:31 PM</strong></p>
<p>I think Barbados meant in the future. I don't see how this would completely disrupt your gaming Sabeth, what if there was a patch to say.. fix a bug that one door wouldn't open in Qeynos? Would you be so mad then? The red lines still allow you to play just fine. Sure you're supposed to be immersed but what's the harm when they take a step back for a couple days? Do you get nuts over the new years and halloween and christmas events too? Hell don't the anniversary quests break immersion?</p>

<p>Please just remember it is a game, and that you don't own your character or your gear or any of that. You lease them from Sony for a certain amount of time and they have the right to suspend that at any time. You agree to that every single time you log on. If that bothers you then by all means quit. Otherwise keep on keeping on.</p>

<p>If you took the time to read the news update at log in .. you would see the patch messages are very funny and SOE tried to make them silly for April Fools day.</p>

<p>This IS a game, and anniversary, halloween, xmas etc. special events and surprises are a short break to add a little diversion from grinding and looting.</p>

<p>The stick guys play fine .. they just look silly.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Keisa on April  2, 2007 10:22 AM</strong></p>
<p>I pay SOE to entertain me.  That's why I spend my money on the game.  Yesterday, April 1, I was thoroughly entertained, and my friends and guildies never looked so good.  I definitely got my money's worth, this month.  Seeing the swarm of red stick figures accosting Vule was worth every penny.</p>

<p>BTW, this was not reversible.  One of my friends logged in, called in his kids to see the new "character models," then went out and patched the game back to the normal graphics.  I, on the other hand, had a blast playing stick figures for a day.  I thank SOE for making my day so enjoyable.</p>

<p>Some people just can't take a joke.</p>

<p>*** Highlights ***</p>

<p>New Character Models!</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that we have developed new technology that allows us to change the character models for all races at the same time. This includes the following:</p>

<p>- New Graphics Engine: We completely overhauled the EverQuest graphics engine. . . yes again. All character models have been retextured using this new technology and the results are beyond anyone???s wildest dreams.<br />
- Dynamic effects for animations: Each movement of the model now acts as a separate entity, allowing more life-like animations.<br />
- Enhanced weapon visage: While we didn???t change the look of the weapons, they sure look better on the new character models.</p>

<p>*** Items ***</p>

<p>- Removed some unnecessary stats on Solteris items.<br />
- Fixed a problem with Journeyman's Boots.<br />
- Removed all keys that unlock doors from the world.</p>

<p>*** Quests</p>

<p>- By popular request, we removed all quests and raids from the game. Loot from these events is now found in the form of ground spawns.<br />
- Added 200 new quests in the Slamming Door quest series.</p>

<p>*** Spells ***</p>

<p>- All spells have been renamed to include Al'Kabor in the name. Long live the King!<br />
- Created a new Enchanter spell, Charm Door.</p>

<p>*** Zones ***</p>

<p>- Fixed the door that leads into Sverag, Stronghold of Rage.<br />
- Burned Woods has been moved. We'll leave it up to you to find out where it went.<br />
- Halflings have been kicked out of Rivervale. Their new home is in Runnyeye... yeah, that's where it is.</p>

<p>*** Classes ***</p>

<p>- Rangers are now working as intended.<br />
- Bards have gained the ability to yodel.<br />
- Magicians can now use an Open Sesame ability to open locked doors.</p>

<p>*** NPCs ***</p>

<p>- Snakes still don't kick. I mean, seriously...<br />
- NPCs now lock the doors to their shops and homes at night. Quit waking them up in the middle of the night!</p>

<p>*** Tradeskills ***</p>

<p>- A recipe for Ngreth's Nutritional Nightcap has been added. This drink will give some very nice stats, but will make the player drunk (player, not character). However, you'll have to seek out this recipe on your own.<br />
- Alchemy is not broken.<br />
- A new tradeskill has been added: Doorcraft. Recipes from this tradeskill will allow you to modify existing doors throughout the world including changing knobs, resetting hings, and patching holes in the door.</p>

<p>- The EverQuest Team</p>

<p>I thought it was pretty funny. My informal in game poll says about nine out of ten thought so too. </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Ogulbuk on April  2, 2007 04:11 PM</strong></p>
<p>I think its funny, and I think some people need to take that stick off their asses before it reaches their stomach, its already way too deep in.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Blakyce on April  2, 2007 05:01 PM</strong></p>
<p>That patch message is great, especially the reference to the great Burned Woods story. For EQ2 they gave us big heads. It was great to spend the day playing with huge heads.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Sunshadow on April  2, 2007 06:22 PM</strong></p>
<p>Was a nice change, system performance jumped up a heap. Soloing it didn't make 1 iota of difference, was a little confusing in a group though. </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: pffft on April  3, 2007 04:07 AM</strong></p>
<p>I found it funny that WoW is still the better game with a playing population EQ can only dream about. Mwahahahaha!!!<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Eldoria on April  3, 2007 11:51 AM</strong></p>
<p>Why do these "comment deleted"  come on here and flame EQ all the time if WoW is so great and EQ is so lame then why are they spending time on an EQ board?  Just leave us "poor old fools"  alone to our choice of games and play your little Wow :(<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Eldoria on April  3, 2007 12:00 PM</strong></p>
<p>Why do people want to spend time coming to a EQ board flaming those of us who chose to play EQ?  If WoW is so great and EQ is so lame then spend your time playing your WoW and live us "poor old misguided people" alone  :(<br />

Tin Foil Hat. that way the EQs wont invade his head causing him to become crazy and post here.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Hurk on April  4, 2007 03:00 AM</strong></p>
<p>EQ bashers and WoW fanbois come here because it's like watching an entirely avoidable train wreck happen in slow motion.  Being right does have its rewards!  <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Eldoria Flamestar on April  4, 2007 11:12 AM</strong></p>
<p>Your opinion  :(  I think EQ is great myself and if it is a train wreck then we are riding it by OUR choice  :)<br />

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: FedUp on April  4, 2007 10:22 PM</strong></p>
<p>I recently cancelled my EQ accounts, and left my guild only a week before they killed Mayong. Why? Because EQ has become a joke, a sham. The devs know it is close to the end - they have stopped being developers, and turned into caretakers. The stick figures thing was funny for a few hours, but when it didn't go away, it became an irritant. 90% of my friends who still play got furious and didn't log on when they realized it lasted past the 1st... and it reminded me of all the reasons I quit. </p>

<p>The devs are so completely, utterly, pathetically disconnected from the playerbase. They abandoned the single group game, and turned it into a repetitive raid grind gear fest. </p>

<p>It's sad, really... for 8 years I loved Everquest, I wish they could stop the bleeding, but I know it's over. Besides, even with the performance issues (which get better every week) Vanguard is a much better game. </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Eldoria on April  4, 2007 11:10 PM</strong></p>
<p>Some of what you are saying is true I think including some of your complaints, but as far as what is a good or bad game I still maintain that it is a matter of opinion just like what is a good or bad movie or even what is your faverite color you may say red is the best and I say green everyone has a right to there own opinion and it does not make either right or wrong just different :)</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Tolem on April  5, 2007 12:00 PM</strong></p>
<p>The only reason people come here and saw, "WoW" is a better game, or "vangaurd rules!!" is because its new. You left a game that you played for EIGHT YEARS, you could be playing UO and still think its the shiznit after EIGHT YEARS of ONE GAME. So maybe you just got a lil bored? </p>

<p>Why slander such a beautiful game. <br />
Go to your WoW, and your Vangaurd. In eight years come tell me how much you love it ;)</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Eldoria Flamestar on April  5, 2007 01:27 PM</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Tolem I could not say it better myself thing is we all need to stick together (I mean all online role playing games, EQ, EQ2, UO, DAOC, Vanguard, WoW, Etc.) I mean lets face it guys there are a lot of people our there and I know some of them that think we are all stupid and wasting our time playing online games when we could be part of the "real" world spinding our time doing something worthwhile like fishing or playing golf  :P</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: moongard on April  5, 2007 04:28 PM</strong></p>
<p>Loyalty?  We should be faithful to a GAME?  I definitely hope I've moved on to a better game than EQ, WoW, and Vanguard in 8 years time.  And slander involves the utterance of false and defamatory statements.  Did Loral lie about his in-game experiences?  <br />
Get a grip people, there's no need to respond to an OPINION piece with personal attacks.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Eldoria on April  6, 2007 11:20 AM</strong></p>
<p>No one here is sanctioning any personal attacks on anyone here or at least they should not be and I do not see anything posted above that should be construed as a personal attack on anyone.  I know all I am saying is when people come on here and say game X sucks or game y is way better than game z I think they should phrase that as there own opinion and not as a fact and besides I think 99.99% of the people that post such statements here are just doing it to be an irritant and not posting helpful or insightful information, notice for example how some who say that game x is better than EQ did not even bother to post there real e-mail address?  Looks to me like they are the ones who want to post a defamatory statement and then leave it anomysly :(</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: pffft on April  6, 2007 12:19 PM</strong></p>
<p>IN MY OPINION, WoW is a better game than EQ because 99.9% of the good folks have left the buggy EQ world and only the no-lifers remain.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Eldoria on April  7, 2007 12:54 AM</strong></p>
<p>You do have a right to express your opinion pffft and I would defend that but why do you have to be derogatory about people that do not agree with you?  I have a very full life myself and just because in my opinion EQ is a better game than WoW I fail to see why you wish to come on here and insult people and there life that you know nothing about and if you are so sure about yourself why do you hide behind that made up e-mail address :P</p>

<p>Futhermore pffft there are people out there (as I stated in an earlier post) that think we ALL do not have a life who play these games EQ and Wow alike and I think they are wrong too  :)<br />
