<html><head><title>Looking Towards Tuesday</title></head><body><h1>Looking Towards Tuesday</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-12-02</p>You have made arrangements to have Shadows of Luclin in your hands on Tuesday, right? I mean, you aren't thinking of waiting or anything, are you? ARE YOU?!?!<p>Unfortunately, if you're British you won't have much choice, as reported on <a href="http://www.everlore.com/">Everlore</a>:<p><B>All UK players should note that due to the strange reasoning that games are only released on Fridays, SOL will not be available until Friday 7th December. <p>This is from the 'Game' &amp; 'Electronics Boutique' shops.</B><p>I'm sure enterprising Brits will find a way to get themselves a copy on Tuesday. Players in other parts of the world are facing a similar situation; in Australia, for instance, the game isn't scheduled for release until the 16th. Since all the Gem Encrusted Ring-type drops will be long since nerfed by that point, dedicated Aussies will be seeking out help as well.<p>Speaking of the international community...<p><BIG>Le Big Mac</BIG><p>We kind of assume you saw these already, but in case you didn't, there are some newish Luclin <a href="http://www.eqloft.com/encyclopedie/luclin/galerie3.html">screenshots</a> on EQ Loft, a French EQ site. The pictures aren't techincally any different, but they somehow seem snooty and dismissive. Perhaps Jerry Lewis can explain that one to us.<p><BIG>Flash--It's Luclin</BIG><p>Verant has tagged a slick little Flash movie onto their <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/">EverQuest site</a> that illustrates Al'Kabor's discovery of the way to Luclin. Hey, it's not the Episode II trailer, but it's okay.<p><BIG>Spell Changes Galore</BIG><p>Lots of changes in the realm of the arcane arts--at least on Test server. As always, we never know which of these spells will go live, but it's always interesting to keep tabs on Lawrence Poe's tinkering.<p>It seems mages are <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=9009.topic

">losing</a> the spell that was supposed to prevent mobs from summoning players. Like we couldn't seen the handwriting on the wall for that one.<p>Wizards get a new <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=9033.topic">low-level nuke</a> spell that even old sorcerers seem to be happy about. Waitaminute... wizards happy? I must be loopy from cold medicine.<p>Druids get some <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=25965.topic">new spells</a>, including Spirit of Eagle (see invis, levitate, infravision, speed increase), Nature's Recovery (30 HP/tick regen), and Ro's Smoldering Disjunction (decrease a mob's AC, HP, fire resist, and ATK).<p>New <a href="http://www.final-destiny.org/info/EnchanterSpells-OnTest.htm">Enchanter spells</a> abound, including Spellshield (a sort of rune spell vs. magic attacks), new illusions, and Speed of the Brood (66% haste, AGI boost, and decrease STA loss).<p>Shadowknighs also get <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shadowknight/showthread.php?s=ac44273446cc33538b0409292ecd9837&amp;threadid=11128">something nifty</a>: Deathly Temptation, which turns the SK into a skelly and trades 16 HP for 6 mana/tick--a toned-down version of the necro's lich spell.<p>Not to be outdone, NPCs will have some <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=17924.topic">new tricks</a> up their sleeves as well. A few favorites include Breath of the Shissar (DoT for 4000 HP in 200 ticks, Decrease Attack Speed by 35%), Serpentine Curse (DoT for 6000 HP in 300 ticks, Decrease Mana by 70), and the impressive Touch of the Mistress (DoT for 60,000 HP in 1200 ticks, Decrease Current Hitpoints by 500, Decrease Strength by 100). You read that right--DoTs that last 20, 30, and 120 minutes!<p>Somehow, I feel like the NPCs got the better end of this deal.<p><BIG>Patches--Insert Quip Here</BIG><p>There was a new patch server message that explains why it will take you a bit longer than usual to get into the game over the next few days:<p><B>November 29th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>*Luclin Prep Patches*<p>Over the next several days leading up to the launch of Luclin, we will be sending you files that all customers will need, regardless of their Luclin status.  Among these are the art necessary for your client to display the Vah Shir character race, Beastlord pets, and Luclin weapons. <br>We appreciate your patience as we prepare to launch our most ambitious expansion to date.<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>We pretty much expected that. So even if you don't buy Luclin (/shudder), prepare for patches, and patches to those patches, and follow-up patches to those.<p><BIG>Where Do They Find the Time?</BIG><p>Just when you thought 100% of Verant's resources were going into the Luclin release, they surprise us by <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/en/

">announcing</a> another FanFaire:<p><B>By popular demand, the EverQuest Fan Faire is heading to Texas!!<p>Make plans now to join us in Dallas on January 25-26 at the Adam's Mark Hotel. Register early to avoid missing out on a great time!</B><p>It's a good thing Verant is sitting on truckloads of those EverQuest action figures, since none of the employees will have time to go Christmas shopping for their kids, what with the Luclin release and this FanFaire. &quot;Gee, thanks Dad, another Grenix Mucktail. This will look great next to the one I got for my birthday.&quot;<p><BIG>A Rumor That Will Make Your Guild Leader Puke</BIG><p>Are you in a guild that spent countless hours equipping your members with epic weapons? Did you experience the joy of killing the royals in Chardok? Of camping Ragefire? Of subjecting yourselves to the Plane of Sky over and over again?<p>Sweet. Then you're ready for round two.<p>Paladins are <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=13149.topic">yammering</a> about one of those &quot;a GM told my buddy&quot; rumors again. This time, the GM supposedly said that Luclin will have an upgrade step to the epic weapon quests, to bring the weapons up to date.<p>Right now, the officers in my guild just upped their Prozac dosage by 300%. But they can probably relax, because:<p>- This story is being told by paladins. They gossip more than old ladies in a beauty parlor.<p>- The rumor is pretty unlikely, as Verant has stated before that the epic weapons are not intended to be the best items in the game--dropped weapons are.<p>- All the crappy out-of-the-way mobs already drop items for the original epic quests anyway. Where the hell would they put the new drops? Oh, that's right--in Luclin.<p>Anyway, we'll all be too busy with our <B>epic armor</B> quests to worry about updating our weapons... yet!<p>God, I love causing guild leaders to get ulcers!<p><BIG>Twinks on a Rampage</BIG><p>Finally an uberguild Web page is fun to read again! Leave it to <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/index.shtml">Legacy of Steel</a> to find a way to amuse themselves (and us) after endless reports of NToV loot. The normal LoS l33t forces were retired for the evening as their twink alts came forth to slay Lady Vox. Ah, just like the good old days--but with much better equipment.<p>That's it. Go now and enjoy the last weekend of boring old graphics, and think about all the great times you've had in the Old World--because all bets are off come Tuesday.<p>P.S. If you don't have a hotkey for <B>/ooc CAMP CHECK</B> yet, you better make one now.
