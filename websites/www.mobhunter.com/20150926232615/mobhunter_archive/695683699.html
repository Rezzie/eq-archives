We've got a few interesting tidbits to highlight for you, just in case you didn't sign up.<p>Here's what those of us who can't be in the suicide capital this weekend will be missing at FanFaire:<p><B>Attendees will also be treated to a chance to experience EverQuest on high-end Intel Pentium computers in a Intel's &quot;Arm Yourself For Adventure&quot; game room! Each player will have one hour to experience EverQuest in its full glory on an Intel Pentium 4 system! Gaming doesn't get much sweeter than this...</B><p>Hmmm, seems Verant really <I>does</I> want you to upgrade your PC after all. You can almost picture some manager at Intel excitedly rubbing his greasy hands together at the thought of those extra dollars coming in.<p>New to this edition of the newsletter is a little riddle. It's made up of a poem and a puzzle piece--which turns out to be nine different puzzle pieces, actually:<p><table><tr><td><B>Nine to Unfold<p>Unity to bind <br>A word of discovery <br>An answer to find<p>Nine to unfold <br>Shattered and lost <br>A power untold<p>A domain of destination <br>Outside the normal world <br>The boundary of imagination <p>Veiled in darkest night <br>Combined, the magic is revealed<br>By a hand righteous of might<p>A new world will beckon <br>No longer concealed</B></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><img src="http://everquest.station.sony.com/images/9D1734R68CKY2.jpg"></td></table><p>That's the piece we got, anyway. Turns out that crafty Nathan Pearce and his band of Web-coding hoodlums came up with the idea of breaking an image into nine pieces and sending them out randomly to the various newsletter subscribers. He was hoping people would have to work together to solve the riddle--and they did, over at <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=10774.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=25">The Safehouse</a>. The players there put the fragments <a href="http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/puz/puz.jpg">together</a> and realized the tablet spelled out the word &quot;Nektulos.&quot; If you go to <a href="http://www.nektulos.com/">www.nektulos.com</a> you see a very interesting <a href="http://ojaste.dhs.org/~shariin/images/nektulos2.jpg">picture</a> indeed.<p>Further research found a hidden phrase in the HTML of the newsletter: <B>&quot;Now, don't get lost in the Sevac Gniliaw...&quot;, said the High Priest Hammerfel.</B> Spell that gibberish phrase backwards and you get Wailing Caves, which also has a <a href="http://www.wailingcaves.com/">Web site</a> with an associated <a href="http://ojaste.dhs.org/~shariin/images/wailing.jpg">picture</a>.<p>What is all this leading up to? Tune in next month to find out. In the meantime, let your speculation run wild. I have a feeling Mr. Pearce will be providing us more clues in the coming weeks.<p>Also revealed, at long last, is the truth about the legendary sea monster that has long been rumored to live in Lake Rathetear:<p><B>Known as the Megalodon, this fabled creature did, in fact, exist in the game at one time. However, its existence caused a couple problems in the game.<p>According to Game Designer Dan Enright, &quot;[Megalodon] was removed because the bounding volume of the model didn't stretch with the size of the model, so players couldn't hit him even though he could kill them. He also didn't path correctly because of his size and the depth of the lake.&quot;<p>But players weren't always at the disadvantage with the Megalodon thanks to that same bounding volume problem. &quot;He was an easy exploit target,&quot; explains Designer Bill Coyle. &quot;You could cast on him from land with impunity so he was removed. I miss that big shark.&quot; <p>The Megalodon was removed from the game during Beta, Phase 4. The story behind its sudden disappearance reveals that the Megalodon's growing power and thirst for carnage had come to the attention of the gods themselves. It is speculated that they had begun to fear the beast's mounting strength. Prexus, the Oceanlord, finally slew the Megalodon at the behest of his immortal peers.</B><p>Granted, a lot of today's players are probably saying &quot;I never heard anything about a sea monster there,&quot; but this is interesting reading for us old-schoolers. Maybe next time we can get the full story on Mayong Mistmoore's fabled disappearance, or find out whatever happened to <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/southernkarana.html">Cracktusk</a>. Give us more of these kinds of behind-the-scenes stories, please.<p><BIG>Tigole Sells Out!</BIG><p>Tigole, uberleader of the uberguild known as <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/">Legacy of Steel</a>, made a rather startling announcement on his guild's site:<p><B>This week I accepted a position as Associate Game Designer with Blizzard Entertainment.  Specifically, I will be designing quests for World of Warcraft, Blizzard's MMORPG based on the popular Warcraft series.  In addition to my duties as Quest Designer, I will also be expected to contribute to helping design the end game content for World of Warcraft.  The reason I am sharing this information (besides the fact that I have a masochistic love of reading rants and flames about myself) is because I know that the fans of this site are hardcore MMORPG players.  The readers of this site have also come to know my personal opinions on what constitutes a fun gaming experience versus what feels like a complete waste of time or poorly designed encounter.<p>You've all read my opinions on such things as tedious key camps, obvious time sinks devoid of any story or linear narrative, quests which reward the lucky over the skilled and quest rewards which are out of synch with the amount of time and effort required to complete them.  I hope that my association with World of Warcraft will serve to comfort MMORPG fans that &quot;one of us&quot; is on the other side of the fence, looking out for the interests of the player.</B><p>If you haven't checked out the screenshots and info on <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/">Worlds of Warcraft</a>, you should; it's an amazing looking game. We all know, of course, that pretty pictures alone don't guarantee a great RPG. But with Tigole helping to design quests and endgame content, we just gained a lot more confidence that this title will be worth checking out.<p>And uh, by the way, we're just kidding about the &quot;selling out&quot; part. In case you haven't noticed, there have been so many naysayers calling me or the site a sellout (or VAK, or wannabe Verant employee) that it's just kind of a running <a href="http://www.stinkfactor.com/cohandler.cfm?coid=8">joke</a> around here. Honestly, we wish Tigole the best, and are glad that one of the good guys (relatively speaking... /wink) is going to be a part of the next generation of MMORPGs. Keep 'em honest, Tigole.<p>Let's just hope the LoS site doesn't become a billboard for Blizzard, or we'll have to take back all the nice things we just said!
