<h1 class="article_title">Further Prophecies and the Everquest Expansion Release Cycle</h1>
<p>by mshea on January 16, 2006</p>

<p>First, a look at the news:</p>

<p>The beta for the new expansion <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=161906">began last week</a>, with beta requests succeeding sporatically as players hit the site.  Those invited into the beta are sworn to secrecy, not only on what wonders they see but even their attendance within the beta itself.  Silence itself becomes a clue.</p>

<p>SOE posted some new information to the Prophecy of Ro website including <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50053">two videos</a>.  One video shows the rebuild of Freeport including all new Freeport militia barracks, <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/expansions/prophecyofro/images/prophecyofro4.jpg">a new dock</a>, and the new temple of Marr.  The second video shows off some of the new zones in Prophecy.  The zones definitely look other-worldly.  SOE also announced a rebuild of both Freeport and the Desert of Ro released to everyone, whether you purchase Prophecy or not.</p>

<p>Contrary to the premature complaints on the forums, Prophecy of Ro will include both high-end and mid-level content.  The newly revamped Desert of Ro and Freeport zones will offer some new content for lower and mid-level folks while higher-end raiders will find new challenges as well.</p>

<p>Raging Fury was the <a href="http://www.lavanet.no/rf/">first to defeat Mistmoore</a> and later, SOE's Kytherea posted an <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50052">interview with the guild</a>.  In response to raid-tuning criticism, Prathun, the designer of the Demiplane of Blood and many of the high-end raids since Gates, <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=161910#M161910">talked about the tuning of the Demiplane</a>:</p>

<p>"The Demi-Plane of Blood was completed, start to finish, without any retuning.  That's nine end-game raids in three tiers that didn't need developer spying, gradually reducing the toughness, or removing hard features.  Guilds that beat Redfang, Zi-Thuuli, Hatchet, Sisters, Devlin, Tris, Roley, the Performer, and Mayong killed version 1.0.  Every time."</p>

<p>The guild Assent <a href="http://eq.nitrous.org/eq/media/">released a video</a> of their journey through the Depths of Darkhollow including a couple of clips of Mayong Mistmoore, the official end-boss of Depths.  Mayong's death resulted in a <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50054">new bit of lore</a> leading to the Prophecy of Ro.  </p>

<p>Chris Lena, producer of Everquest, recently <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50059">gave an interview</a> on EQPlayers.  Along with his Neil-Gaiman-like picture, Chris gave an excellent Kurt-Vonniguty answer to the question "How did you choose [Raghnell's] name?"</p>

<p>"I didn't – it was fated since before the dawn of humankind. So it is written and so it shall be."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000CPSHFS/">Everquest Titanium</a>, the $20 Everquest package including the base game, all ten expansions, and a 30 day subscription, has been released.  This is the easiest it's ever been to get into EQ.</p>

<p>Now on to our hot topic of the day:  The Everquest Expansion Release Cycle.</p>

<p>Ever since the release of Planes of Power, a massive expansion with nearly a year-long development cycle, SOE released expansions every six months.  Only once, after the release of Gates of Discord, was an expansion delayed, and then it was only for a month.  Every other expansion; Ykesha, LDON, Omens, Dragons, Depths, and now Prophecy; has come out or will come out every six months.</p>

<p>Every time a new expansion is released the boards light up with angry posts.  Most of these are from the "fix bugs" category (don't worry, I don't plan to gloss over this one so easily) but some dig into other thoughts and ideas.</p>

<p>Here are a few reasons people get upset about the six-month development cycle:  bugs from the previous expansion, class balance issues, haven't finished a lot of the content in previous expansion yet, one's raiding guild hasn't defeated the last boss yet, $30 every six months on top of $15 a month is a lot of money, the next expansion will come out buggy, one just got to a certain power level and doesn't want to have to get to a next one.  All of these are valid issues and all deserve a deeper look.</p>

<p>I have often dismissed the "fix bugs" reason mostly because those bringing it up don't follow through with a list of the bugs they want fixed.  Often the bugs turn out to be class balance problems - not real bugs, but there ARE real bugs that need to be addressed.  The best thing we can do is articulate this list and bring it up when we can instead of using a more generic call for bug fixing.</p>

<p>Whether or not these bugs would be fixed with a different release cycle is unknown.  We can assume, from the outside, that by delaying an expansion SOE could fix bugs instead of building new content, but given the unknown economic model, we can't say whether or not they'd have to cut back on the number of people on the developers team to make up for the lack of expansion money coming in.  Those bugs might last just as long whether there is a new expansion every six months or every year.  That doesn't mean bugs shouldn't be fixed, though.  It means we need to do our best to bring them to the attention of the developers and watch their progress ourselves.</p>

<p>Content progression is another big argument against the six-month development cycle.  A lot of raiders aren't able to finish the raid content in a new expansion before the next expansion comes out.  There is a careful balance between too much and too little raid content, it seems, and while some powerful guilds will have farmed the top encounters for months - others struggle to get past raid encounters from expansions long past.</p>

<p>The situation doesn't improve for single-group hunters.  There's often a lot of content unused by single-group hunters.  Some go immediately to newer and more rewarding content in newer expansions while some stay in the older hunting areas where they know exactly what to expect.  Many players who rely on pickup groups for progression have to move where the bulk of the players go - whether it is to new expansions or staying in old ones.</p>

<p>Can there be too much content?  Can't groups simply pick the areas they want to go, picking through the vast quantities of possibilities in search of the most fun and rewarding ones?  A lot of these problems require a different train of thought.  Everquest isn't a game with an ending (one of the reasons I hate the term "end-game").  Very very few ever hit every single major encounter in the game.  Accepting that many of us will never exhaust an expansion would help us more enjoy the content we do face.  At that point it becomes a question of whether or not we get our money's worth from each expansion.</p>

<p>Is $30 every six months for a new expansion worth it? It's up to each of us to decide.  No one forces us to buy a new expansion, though the drive of the other players makes the desire for new expansions different from single-player game expansions.  Ultimately, however, we vote with our dollar.  If the features and content aren't enough to interest us, we shouldn't buy it.  Most of the time, however, the features and content are enough to get us interested.  Compared to the $50 to $60 for single-player games, $30 for an expansion in which we may spend hundreds of hours is not a bad deal.  It's always important to remember that our true power in this game is our wallets.  If it's not what we want or we don't want it yet because we haven't finished the last one, we shouldn't buy it.</p>

<p>World of Warcraft changed the face of massive online games in many ways.  One element that may have led to its success is the sheer amount of polish.  It plays well and it plays clean.  There are bugs but they're hard to find and while other games may have one struggling to move around an interface, Warcraft builds a seamless world around you.  Blizzard is also spending up to two years of development time on their first new expansion.  Likely it will be as polished as the initial game.  Already they have people betatesting it, over six months from the release.  There is something to be said for taking that sort of time to clean up a product.</p>

<p>Is six months too short?  That's a hard question to answer.  We cannot say for sure that we would receive better products or better support if the cycle increased.  We simply do not know the full economics of SOE's business to say for sure how things will come out.  Before the days of Planes of Power they had much longer development cycles but bugs still existed.  They aren't worse today than they were back then.  Content still had to be tuned and retuned.</p>

<p>Personally, I always look forward to the newer expansions. I love seeing this world grow.  I like having vast amounts of content from which to pick and choose.  I like growing in power and seeing new places.  I always fondly remember my first days in a new expansion.  There are no expansions where I feel like I didn't get my $30 worth.  Sure, I get vexed when I think about Dragons and realize that most of my time there was in Creator missions.  Sure, I'm mad at the sheer amount of difficult or locked content in Gates.  I still spent many many hours, hours where I was highly entertained, in those expansions.</p>

<p>This topic has many facets and many of them, the business ones, are unknown to us.  As players we can do our best to tell SOE what we want, what we want fixed, show them what we are willing to pay for, and show them what we are not.  It isn't our responsibility to tell them how to run their business. It is our job to tell them and show them what we desire.</p>

<p>/agree</p>

<p>A very interesting and in-depth assessment of the 6-month development cycle.  I personally don't think a game can get too big.  I play very little of the new content, but I like knowing it's there, hearing people talk about it, and knowing that someday I'll have those areas to hit as well.  <br />

<p>The thing that bugs me is that on older expansions it's very difficult to find groups and stuff. I haven't done anything in Gates, Omens, Dragons or Darkhollow past the monster missions. My 2nd favorite expansion, LDoN, is completely empty and worthless and Luclin and Velious are gimpy exp.<br />
Meh, I know I'm just not looking hard enough.</p>

<p>I do think a game can get too big, and I think EQ has reached that point (indeed, reached it a while ago), as is clear by the huge numbers of empty zones.  I know tons of people (casuals, mostly, since that is what I am), that have not been beyond inkttua (sp?) in GoD, done any MPG trials in OOW, seen even a quarter of the missions (let alone the progression events) in DoN or even xp'd in DoD, (most people have at least seen the zones thanks to the slipgear quest and the goblin rogue shroud).  While part of that is no doubt due to people's unwillingness to try new things, it's also a result of the fact that there are already AMPLE options for xp, and the perception of many of the newer areas is that they require gear that can only be acquired through raids or hundreds if DoN missions (the option most casuals seem to pursue).</p>

<p>However, having too much content is not a 'problem' that is easily solved, particularly given that the MMO genre has basically solidified around a strategy of releasing expansions to attract new players, increase profits, and slow the attrition of existing players.  </p>

<p>As a result, I don't have any suggestions, simply a growing feeling that there is already too much (unused) content, and that a new expansion every six months is exacerbating the problem.  Of the new expansion, I am far more interested in the FP and Desert of Ro revamps (which, incidentally, do not require me to buy the expansion), than I am about new zones that will just continue to extend what is meant by 'high end.'</p>

<p>So... not a very constructive post, for sure, but I felt like offering my own entirely subjective feelings on the matter anyway.</p>

<p>Today I purchased the new Titanium version thinking I would reactivate an account I had been missing.  When I went to activate the registration the web page somehow took me directly to the spot where the registration is to be entered in and so I did so.  Once I had completed typing in the code I was taken back to customer information and to my dismay the account name was not the one I had logged into the game as but instead it had been switched to the last name I used when I logged into the account site.</p>

<p>What this means is that I have now registered the Titanium to my existing and fully expansion registered account.  There was no way at all for me to avoid this since the account name weas not posted on the actual activation page.  </p>

<p>I am now informed by SOE via their on line chat that once an account is registered it is impossible to be changed.  I interpret this to mean they are completely unconcerned with customer service even though the problem was cuased because of a bug in the way their registration software is set up.</p>

<p>I had hoped to begin playing the other account again but now I am out the cost of the new package and I have a nicely decorated box of cd frisbees.  They may make good games but when it comes to customer service they really are taking a huge backwards step.  Perhaps they need to be added to the Clark Howard List of Customer NO Service organizations.</p>

<p>sorry for the rant, I just dont like getting ripped off.</p>

<p>Horzek - you need to push a little harder on customer service.  there has to be a way to escalate it (throught the proper channels).  perhaps they can't modify an existing account's expansions but perhaps they can send you a new key or SOMETHING to alleviate the problem?</p>

<p>do your best and keep communicating with them until some sort of resolution can be agreed upon.</p>

<p>(just don't take it to the SOE boards)</p>

<p>No, that's exactly SOE's top notch CS at work.  I know someone who bought a game card for a friend as a gift so he could play again. He mistakenly activated it under his own fully subscribed account (which uses a CC). They refused to refund the error and transfer it to the other account. And don't give me any bs that they couldn't change it. Of course they could of.</p>

<p> I've also had my own run in with SOE where they decided to lose a customer rather than offer any assistance.</p>

<p>As for the new expansion... I think the expansions past GoD have shown they can push them out every 6 months.  They typically look weak until about 2-3 months in when a lot of the answers have been found and in retrospect were worth the price.  Of course I still maintain that the vast majority of players do not do most of the content but that is their own decision.  </p>

<p>Nice write-up Loral. </p>

<p>Are EQ and its community better off with expansions coming out before the community demands it? And why aren't we demanding it?</p>

<p>If you remember back to the days before PoP, there were some pretty strongly worded demands for new content as the previous release was being beaten. Not just from the end-game guild getting tired of farming the same content, but also from the near end-game guilds being cockblocked by said end game guild. ;) </p>

<p>With the advent of instancing and improved encounter designs that have taken place over the past few years, how long would it be before these various community segments would start rallying to ask for another expansion if the cycle were longer? </p>

<p>Remember, the expansions released after PoP, (the most high end focused expansion to that point in time), were very much focused on groups and lower levels (LoY / LDoN). By releasing a more targetted expansion every 6 months, you would still see a strong demand from various player groups asking for more content, groups that didn't receive new content in the latest expansion. Somewhere along the way, the player community noticed this, and groups of players would start claiming to skip expansions, fearing that their playstyle was not receiving "content", only features that may or may not be worth the pricetag of the expansion. SOE heard and responded to this complaint by building some fairly well balanced expansions, providing content for most playstyles, but continuing to maintain the 6 month release cycle that has been present since PoP's release. </p>

<p>So, is it a bad thing that SOE has evolved significantly over the years to better address these player concerns? </p>

<p>The 6 month expansion cycle has been around for a while now, and I believe the reason we're finally seeing complaints about the timeframe is that the expansions are actually providing the type of content we've all asked for. Personally, I prefer what's currently being done much more than the older, more targetted releases.<br />

<p>The marketing message has not reached me for Prophecy of Ro - I just cannot see any 'wow'-factor that makes it a compelling buy.<br />
Point of fact is that like the majority of players, there is still so much to uncover and experience in the expansions we already have, (and it is all accesable) that it PoR just has no interest for me (first time I can say that about an eq expansion).</p>

<p>That is the big issue with 6-month rolling expansions, it cheapens the eq experience by diluting it rather than by enriching it when the expansions come so close together.  <br />
Also, for every player it entices back into the game, it probably also acts as a trigger point for an existing player to make the decision to 'take a break' or try a new game.  My guild has lost 2 already unfortunately, citing the expansion release as the trigger for a decision.  I can relate to what they are saying.</p>

<p><br />
I so wish that the next expansion focused on restoring the 0-65 game, bringing in fresh blood and building on the work put into the new newbie trial, etc.  A rich player experience and not a 2 month character creation process would give mmporg players in other games a reason to play EQ.  When people put on their rose-tinted glasses and look back to eq of years past, that is the feeling that they seem to be describing and missing more than anything else.</p>

<p>I wonder if it says something that WOW are developing their 1st expansion and taking 2 years to release it? You could argue that the expansion schedule of EQ in the early days was similar. Should EQ take a leaf out of WOW's book or is WoW infact just a younger EQ waiting to happen?</p>

<p>I think 6 months is not long enough, not long enough for the average player to get all the important things from an expansion and not long enough to develop good story lines and bug test it. EQ gets alot right, but misses little things that can make the world of difference sometimes.</p>

<p>Raids are becoming more annoying, but the 24-7 raiders seem to be eating them up, I just hope it doesnt alienate others.</p>

<p>Regarding unused zones....whats the difference if a zone exists and no one uses it versus it not existing at all?  So some content is outdated.  It happens after 8 years.  The content is still there for anyone who does want to go somewhere quiet or for nostalgia.   But if you want to group, you know where to go.</p>

<p>I'm sure if the game is around for several more years that zones like Guk, Seb, etc will get a revamp and that will be a good thing.  But in the mean time they are still viable places to go.  You just have to BYOG.</p>

<p>Here's a note from a reader.  He approved this note for posting:</p>

<p>Loral,<br />
In your latest news article, you mentioned:</p>

<p>"World of Warcraft changed the face of massive online games in many ways. One element that may have led to its success is the sheer amount of polish. It plays well and it plays clean. There are bugs but they're hard to find and while other games may have one struggling to move around an interface, Warcraft builds a seamless world around you. Blizzard is also spending up to two years of development time on their first new expansion. Likely it will be as polished as the initial game. Already they have people betatesting it, over six months from the release. There is something to be said for taking that sort of time to clean up a product."</p>

<p>While I agree with this statement, and it is true in every sense ... There is more to the picture than just the above.</p>

<p>Over the past year, blizzard has also added lots of new content and functionality to their game. One could argue, as much content/functionality<br />
that a regular expansion would entail, including a total of 8 new zones, lots of new functionality to 3 zones that existed on release, increased functionality/features, and new spells/abilities.</p>

<p>For Functionality, they have revised classes, added new spells/skills to the game. Also, they have added new trade skill recipes, item types, items, monster types, quests, rewards, battle grounds & pvp honor system, progression types, factions, faction rewards, lore, and more. Dynamic world changing quest (1 so far) for the whole server and every level to participate in. Holiday events, and regular monthly and yearly events<br />
players of all levels can participate in  (traveling faire 1/month.</p>

<p>Children’s week 1/year - ect). Two looking for group tools.</p>

<p>As for content: they’ve added one outdoor top level zone to the game. Added cities/quests to two mid-level (40-50) zones. Added over one hundred new quests (probably a lot more). Two indoor five man dungeons (one mid-level 40-50, one top level 60). Three indoor dungeons for the raid environment (two 40 man raid level for highest level of achievement, one 20man- for lvl<br />
60 mid-level achievement). Three new battle grounds zones (PVP arenas, with goals. 40man war, 15man king of the hill style, and 10man capture the flag). 6 new outdoor raid bosses for 20-40 people. 4 new summonable outdoor raid bosses for 20-40 people.</p>

<p>Also, they’ve introduced new methods of players gaining top level equipment for non-raiders. You can now gain epic level 60 gear from difficult but<br />
doable class quests, dungeons, completing faction, PVPing, tradeskilling, farming/grinding for gold, buying a random drop bind on equip item, and<br />
completing quests open to all players. A non-raider has the opportunity to be every bit as powerful as a raider – something I haven't experienced yet in any MMO to date.</p>

<p>I understand this is an everquest site, and that you cannot focus on other games too often. However, I wanted to point out just how high the bar has been raised (in the eyes of WoW players at least) by blizzard. Also, please note: All of the above listed content was added without reducing the usage of older zones as was the case with the release of velious and kunark. Also, note, this game has a lot of replayability (something most other MMOs lack).</p>

<p>It's not uncommon to find someone with two or more top level (lvl 60) chars. For example, I myself have restarted on five different servers (Three PVP, two PVE), and have four level 60s. I also usually play with the same group of 7-10 people during my playtime regardless of which char I’m playing.</p>

<p>Maybe Sony could learn a few lessons from Blizzard in these regards. I am however, of the belief that Everquest is past its time for redemption. The<br />
system is too slow, and the world has too much history. Adding more areas and newer gear isn’t all about raising the hp caps and damage caps of<br />
monsters.</p>

<p>For this, I will take an example from WoW: Dire Maul. The goal in the north wing of dire maul, is to get through to the end boss of the zone, while<br />
specifically avoiding the deaths of several boss mobs that are in your way. This is called a 'tribute' run, where you kill the ogre king. If the king dies, you become king for the time you spend in the zone, and every boss you passed up in killing brings you a better item, than he would have otherwise dropped by being killed. Avoiding these bosses however is definitely more difficult than killing them.</p>

<p>One might say that this game has remained healthy for a year without an expansion. However, I'd argue that an expansion was released over the course of the year, which was a large contributor to keeping the game healthy and active.</p>

<p>*** Here's my response ***</p>

<p>I do think SOE brings a fair amount of the changes you mention.  We receive new free zones with each expansion including Lavastorm, Nedaria's Landing, Nektulos, and upcoming Freeport and Ro.  There are a bunch of new missions and encounters added after expansion releases including four monster missions released after Depths came out and about eight new missions after Dragons.  New spells, items, and quests are added continually.  Some are fixes but some are entirely new content.</p>

<p>I'm not saying its the same amount that WOW releases but over the same time period I think EQ has received a lot of similar updates.</p>

<p>and all for the low price of how much? WoW did it for free, SoE charged for it. I guess you totally missed the point of the quoted message. Typical.</p>

<p>Loral isn't the one missing the point here. The things he mentioned above were added by SOE free between expansions. </p>

<p>I'll start off the bug list.  Starting with DoDH, Steadfast Servants run out of mana early and stop casting heals 15-20 minutes into their 30 minute life.  Problem acknowledged by devs but still not fixed.</p>

<p>" Also, note, this game has a lot of replayability (something most other MMOs lack)."</p>

<p>Actually, most MMO's have very solid replayability in their early days, EverQuest was no exception to this. As the proverbial mountain gets higher with additional levels / gear, you start to see people shy away from rolling up new characters because the distance becomes to great (assuming their target is the ever elusive end-game for these alts).</p>

<p>I think the distance between a new starter to everquest & the High end is vast, the low end of the game is still enjoyable....IF you can find enough people to get a group going, since PoP it has been getting harder & harder to find people to group with at these low levels.</p>

<p>I think it is time to re-evaluate the low end of the game, Monster missions offered a means for lower players to group up with their higher levelled friends & offered very good xp rates, the problem is that you do not learn your class very well (although you do gain an insight into how other classes operate * i do think that counts for something) and the other big problem is that your skills will be very very far behind & poorly developed.</p>

<p>I think the low end of the game needs looking at in terms of offering gamers at those levels solo routes of play, be it missions, tasks, quests that enable fast progression but also fast learning & skill raises, the tutorial was great, but to face realities at the lower end if you cannot solo most of the time you are pretty much stuffed, in order to keep people coming into the game (and staying here) there needs to be a fairly quick progress through there, sure the old zones are fun, but the biggest part of the fun in eq is the fun you get with other people, there are too few people around at the lower levels for it to be fun, diehards can argue all they like about ( man it took me years to get to level 50 , why should these noobs get an easier ride) but the game is so far removed from what it used to be, i feel this is just another evolution that is needed to keep the game healthy.</p>

<p>I like the 6 monthly release cycle (well 5 & 7 month is more accurate)& I am looking forward to seeing what PoR can offer ( i am sceptical about it's size though ) but I think SoE really do need to get a "big picture" view on the whole game & how to adapt that big picture to todays audience & still remain loyal to its longtime supporters, I think big changes are still eeded to address that.</p>
