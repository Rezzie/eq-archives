<html><head><title>Saturday Night Special</title></head><body><h1>Saturday Night Special</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-04-27</p><BIG>Easter Time Again</BIG><p>It's officially a pattern. Anytime something new gets posted to a Verant Web site means it's time to break out your Captain Midnight decoder ring and follow the clues to some mystery page for Planes of Power or EQ2.<p>Hammerfel (a.k.a. Nathan Pearce) updated his <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/featured_content/Hammerfel/">Last Rites</a> page with a preview of a new design for the EverQuestLive.com site. But of course that wasn't all there was to it... oh no. But we'll let one of our readers, Spencer, explain how he found the latest Easter egg:<p><B>I knew it had to have a hidden link somewhere, so I went digging. There's nothing interesting in the text of it. But the picture on the side you can click on and make the image bigger, and under the new Community thing it says &quot;Absor hopes no one's found Darathar the Deceiver yet...&quot; and then a line or two under it says &quot;If you're looking for clues, you missed it already! ;)&quot;.</B><p>So if you follow the clue and go to <a href="http://www.daratharthedeceiver.com/">DarathartheDeceiver.com</a>, you get another one of those black screens with a picture hidden in it. And it's quite a picture.<p>Darathar appears to be the first of the EQ2 ubermobs, and to say it's a step up from Naggy and Vox is like saying a pint of Guinness is a bit tastier than a can of Schlitz. Granted, Verant got <I>a lot</I> of mileage out of those old dragon models--and seeing Nagafen for the first time remains one of my coolest EQ experiences ever--but the level of detail in this shot is, frankly, stunning. One can hardly imagine it being three dimensional and moving around on screen. Even the most jaded EQ fanboi has to be pretty impressed.<p>But enough of these silly teaser sites, Verant. Convert Pearce and his team into game coders and pound out EQ2 a few months ahead of schedule. Provide an unending supply of Mountain Dew and limit them to one bathroom break per day--I hear that makes programmers write faster.<p><BIG>Snake Loot 2.0</BIG><p>Okay, so <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/">Triton</a> killed the Emperor in Ssra Temple yet again (spell it with me: F-A-R-M-I-N-G, which of course you and I would be doing too, if we could) and this time got a 16/19 sword with a 100-point proc. But perhaps even more notable was the drop of Garrison's Superior Sundering, a wizard spell that does 2100 points of fire-based direct damage for a mere 540 mana.<p>Wizards are all <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=15965.topic">aflutter</a> because now they know the spell actually exists--albeit as a drop from one of the toughest (and toughest to get to) mobs in the game. Still, a spell of this magnitude <I>should</I> be damn rare. Then again, I bet the rogue daggers in Vex Thal are 18/18 and have 1000-point procs on them. And those are just the common drops from the mobs at the zone in, of course.<p><BIG>I'm Tired of Writing News, So You Do It For Me</BIG><p>This is a pretty important time in EverQuest history (if a computer game can be said to have &quot;history,&quot; but let's not get too philosophical here). With an expansion, a console game, and a whole new sequel in development simulatneously, Verant has a lot of content to design in a relatively short period of time. So it occurs to me that we should probably help them get it right.<p>This is where you, our esteemed, often drunken readers can lend a hand. Hard as it may be to believe, those poor schmucks at Verant actually <I>read</I> this site on occasion, and might even pay attention to what we say once in a while. So what I'd like to do is compile a list of some of the things that they've done right over the years, so that they can make the correct decisions in designing PoP and EQ2.<p>I'm not talking about what loot is the most uber or which character model turns your crank the hardest. What I want to know about is the encounter you think is the most fun, the quest you found most satisfying to complete, the zone that you found most immersive... stuff like that. I want things from all of EverQuest's life span--from beta through Luclin, from level 1 to level 60. Because if we give Verant examples of the stuff that works well, maybe that spirit can be captured in upcoming content.<p>Anyway, <a href="mailto:support@mobhunter.com">send us</a> your picks for the things you like best about EQ and we'll post a top ten list or something. If we use your suggestion we'll even put your name in lights here on the site--and oh, isn't that just a massive incentive for you.<p>Look at it this way: sit back and do nothing, and you have no one but yourself to blame if PoP and EQ2 suck donkey toes. Make a positive suggestion here and you can at least say you tried your best to help--and maybe you'll even make an important impact on the future of EverQuest.<p>Hey, stranger things have happened. Maybe.
