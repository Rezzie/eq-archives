This should save time when looting junk items, as players will no longer need to use the "right click--pause" method of determining whether or not to destroy an item.<BR><BR>



Combined with the confirmation box for looting no-drop items (you *do* have this enabled, right?) and the click-to-equip corpse looting change in the last patch, the methods for looting corpses of all types have improved dramatically.<BR><BR>



Verant is clearly putting a lot of work into upgrading the user interface and fixing bugs in anticipation of the Shadows of Luclin expansion.
