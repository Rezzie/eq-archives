It might screw up some of your First Brood dragon plans, or a Dain raid, so folks on the following servers will have to roll with the changes:<p><B>On Tuesday, October 23rd, at 12AM PDT (7AM GMT), the following servers will be down for network maintenance: Bertoxxulous, Brell Serilis, Cazic Thule, Erollisi Marr, Karana, Lanys T'vyl, Mithaniel Marr, Morell Thule, The Nameless, Prexus, Quellious, Rallos Zek, The Rathe, Rodcet Nife, Saryrn, The Seventh Hammer, Sullon Zek, Torvonnilous, Tunare, Veeshan, and Xegony. The estimated downtime is 6 hours.<p>The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>Absor must be getting a buttload of mail, because he went so far as to advise folks to RTFM before asking questions (not that we can blame him, of course):<p><B>The reduced resistances will be more noticeable the higher level the NPC is. You might not see a dramatic change until you try out some of those 'uber' encounters. That's where the problem with resistances existed, not with the lower level NPCs.<p>I urge you all to read over the comments we've provided carefully before submitting questions. We tried very hard to explain all this as clearly as we can. The answers to most of the questions I am getting have been given already.<p>Alan</B><p>Can we just come out and say we're wild about Rich Waters? Absor has been passing the mic to him and allowing this melee guru to give us the straight poop on what the recent changes mean. Kudos to Absor for doing so.<p>When a player brought up the notion that the change in 2-handers might be penalizing lower-level players, Mr. Waters quickly shot the baseless speculation down:<p><B>This is definitely not the case. I brought this to the attention of Hobart, who checked back over the two-handed damage code and examined all changes to it in the last three months. There were no negative changes at all to the two-handed damage of players, regardless of level. The two-handed damage enhancement this patch is all in addition to the previous two-handed damage bonuses. The damage bonus displayed on all two-handers now is the combination of the old 2h bonus PLUS the new 2h bonus. We were very careful when we implemented this enhancement, and equally careful when we checked out this issue today. In every case we checked, two-handed damage was either the same as it was pre-patch, or increased at the higher levels.<p>- Rich Waters</B><p>The folks of guild <a href="http://www.guildparadigm.org/">Paradigm</a> over on the Solusek Ro server have awakened the Sleeper. Why is this still news? After all, this would be the third time, and nobody cares about the third time a mob is killed, right?<p>We'd agree with that statement 100%, except there <I>is</I> something unique about this particular killing: Paradigm is the first guild to wake the Sleeper <B>twice</B> in as many days.<p>That's right; Paradigm killed Ventani--the fourth and final warder--on the 10th. Kerafrym gave his usual shout about being awakened and... <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fparadigm82099main.showMessage?topicID=934.topic">nothing</a>. He didn't wake up and wipe out the whole zone or go on his killing spree. GMs had to come and try to sort out what happened, and ended up repopping the warders--a first.<p>So what's an uberguild to do? Come back the <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fparadigm82099main.showMessage?topicID=942.topic">next day</a> and do it again. And that's exactly what they did, and it is precisely at this point that our tale becomes trite and boring. Yawn, another broken Sleeper script. Everybody go back to your homes, nothing more to see here.<p>Lastly, you should go download DirectX 8.0a right now. Why? We'll let Absor tell you:<p><B>In the next month or so, prior to the release of EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin, we will be moving to DirectX 8. This will be true not just for those purchasing Shadows of Luclin, but for everyone playing EverQuest.<br>In fact, some time soon, prior to the new interface rollout, we will be giving everyone the DirectX 8 version of the graphics engine dll. This will give players the option of using the new dll to help us find any hardware incompatibilities prior to the time we move to DirectX 8 game-wide. We'll be testing as many configurations as we possibly can in-house, but with the huge number of possible hardware configurations we can't test them all. The plan here is to nail the problems down now and have as many of you updated to DirectX8 as soon as we can before we make the switchover.<p>Why are we doing this? Well, you'll need it to use the new interface and we need it for all of the good things it lets us do for the game, primarily improving framerates (yes, even in the old world and even if you don't buy Shadows of Luclin). For a good idea of the new features we'll be able to implement with DirectX 8, check out our latest In Development (the EVERQUEST TECH DOCUMENT at the bottom).<p>. . .<p>Yes, if you read that carefully you noticed that I said something about a new interface. We will be releasing a new and impressively customizable interface to all EverQuest players with the release of Shadows of Luclin. I don't have a lot of details for you about the new interface at this time. I can tell you that we think you'll be very impressed with it. The main feature of this new interface will be the customizability that it gives the players. We're still building it, so I can't really elaborate, but there is no doubt in my mind that you'll be impressed, or in the least intrigued.</B><p>Faster frame rates = a good thing, and the new interface should be fantastic. Well, we're assuming it will be, anyway. In any case, DirectX 8 should be on your system, so go <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp">get it</a>. Then follow Absor's easy <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000348.html">installation instructions</a>.<p>It ain't <a href="http://www.maximonline.com/girls_of_maxim/girl_780.html">sexy</a>, but it's the news.
