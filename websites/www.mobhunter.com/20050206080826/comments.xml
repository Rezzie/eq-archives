<![CDATA[<p>I am sorry to hear that your server was that way. I was the Warrior that died at least 10 times.  The only time there was not any clerics to give rezzes, was during time they were running back with me to retrieve their bodies.  At least on The Nameless, even though my group had a cleric in it, I was probably rezzed just as many times from passing clerics.  <br />
I think for the whole night I lost a quarter of a percent of xp.  Yes I ran back to my body and dragged to a safe spot (well kinda safe) but my feeling was that even if I had not gotten a rez the xp lose did not come close to the experience.</p>

<p>Question? You guys are talking about things that are going to happen in next expansion. I have gone EQlive website and it never seems to have any more information than when they first listed the expansion.  Where are you guys getting your information at?<br />

      <description>Heh. So what you&apos;re saying is, all that info </description>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<![CDATA[<p>Heh. So what you're saying is, all that info is out of date, Loral?  :-)  Relax,just "picking fun." I didn't care about the article's brevity, I read it like all the rest.  </p>

<p>The real point of my post was kind of buried in the middle, and too subtle--that happens when I get whimsical: "I missed hearing about [the war] because I had to log to preserve my rez timer."  </p>

<p>There just weren't any clerics or necros available for a rez where I had died *the night before.*  All were raiding or offline, both nights, and I was under an hour left.  That's right, I had a choice between spending an unknown amount of time /ooc'ing in POK until a rezzer was free to gouge my lite bank account for a rez--hopefully in time-- or log and come back the next night, hoping to catch a friend online. (I did.)</p>

<p>Now that's great game design: punish the player for being online and enjoying content--make him get OFFLINE to preserve his progress. (And to be clear: that's a swipe at both game design and lack of action re: population drop on servers).</p>

<p>Based on what I heard of the event and how it went on my server, had I shown up, it would have gone poorly: a lvl 65 48AA Enchanter could have hoped to ninja-loot behind some uberguild, and maybe buff, if the lvl 70's were being lazy.  If unlucky, I could have died 10 times like one warrior, and deleveled to 64 if I were unlucky enough to miss (another) rez. </p>

<p>And no, I'm not whining about being 65.  Refusing to buy OOW and DON are *my* choice; I see no point in rewarding Sony for a bass-ackwards system that emphasizes short-term expansion revenue over long-term subscriber revenue, or thinking that the first necessarily leads to the second. </p>]]>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<![CDATA[<p>Hmmm every single GM event save for 1 roleplay one was just a GM slaughtering players. Unless you were topped out in level / aa / gear.. you stood no chance.</p>

<p>Some of them the GM's even used insta proc complete heal items constantly.. weeeeeee lets go get killed by a GM and lose some XP and get squat for it.</p>

<p>Thats what almost all my GM event xp has been, I played for 4 years and went to many many, in hopes that a new GM would acually be able to give some sort of unique quest of equal difficulty for the zone / people.</p>

<p>Best ones were not GM events but scripted zone changes like the halloween stuff. </p>]]>

      <description>&quot;Apparently on one server the players and FV </description>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<![CDATA[<p>"Apparently on one server the players and FV guards made a stand on the bridge into FV and held off the rampaging hordes for an hour until they were overwhelmed."</p>

<p>And that right there is why these events should continue :)  That's the sort of thing that gets people excited about the lore again.</p>

<p>One of the things that Asheron's call did right was to always have some sort of a plot event at every major update.  On a regular schedule even.  The players got used to it, expected it, and in the end they looked past a lot of other problems with the game because they were having so much fun at the monthly updates.  SOE, and other publishers, need to learn that lesson as much as possible.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that DoN is the next Velious in terms of expansions.  Lots of single-group content, lots of raid content, lore matters, factions matter, quests matter.....lots of great fun for everyone.  If that happens, then I think the slow exodus of EQ1 players will stop for the most part.<br />

<![CDATA[<p>They could have events in other zones such as MM raiding GFay/BB as an opportunistic attack while defenders are tired/dead from FV at a later time in the day etc.</p>

<p>Iksars attacking Lanys later on because they werent invited to the earlier party or because "there goes the neighbourhood, Dark Elves!, Arrgh!" etc etc...</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Tradeable doesnt mean just with players, you may be able to trade on type of token with another via a black market NPC.</p>

<p>Anyway we will see soon enough, since no one actually seems to know at this stage.</p>

<p>By the time I logged on after work the event was over, otherwise I would report on it. I did see a few players bodies in the FV tunnel and at its exit in DL.</p>

<p>My Guild killed some Dragoons and Golems in FV but they were stock standard from OT Docks.</p>

<p>Apparently on one server the players and FV guards made a stand on the bridge into FV and held off the rampaging hordes for an hour until they were overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Some good attuneable and no drop gear dropped apparently but being an off peak Guild we didnt see any of it. Its a pity they didnt stage it out over 24 hours....</p>

<p>People with dial up couldnt even zone into areas of conflict, the lag was too great.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I do not care what anyone says.  Last night I saw the system wide message and went to Dreadlands on my Level 63 Warrior and played in the war there. I joined up in a group of people I met that night at the start of the event. We were on the good side and we lost baddly. I died 10 times.  But you know I had more fun playing there last night, and listenning to what was going on, and following the battle all the way through FV, than I have had in a couple years.  The brand new people I met were great people and we killed and died together.  I was exausted and ready for bed when it was done and I have thought about it all day long at work.  </p>

<p>Now that is gaming. That is meeting new people and new friends.  There was new Lore in the making and I was there.  I loved it!</p>]]>

<p>Lavastorm got the best revamp of all and its for lower levels.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say paw is for ubers only but as we know, the term uber means so many different things to so many different people.  Five years ago, Mistmoore at level 30 was for ubers only.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Loral was kind of busy writing up all those guides for Sony, so we got the short shrift this week. As for EQ1, I was amused to note that the war in FV zone -- which I missed hearing about because I had to log to preserve my rez timer -- had a write up on UGO/CastersRealm, with a link to it and to the discussion thread from the EQ boards. </p>

<p>By three hours later, not one person had posted a comment. Gemdiver was forced to post his own followups for discussion...</p>
