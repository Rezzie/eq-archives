Now it's going back to being just a person again. The Web site part seems up in the air at the moment.<p><a href="mailto:myschyf@lumthemad.net">Myschyf</a>, also known as Deb, took over the asylum after Lum himself <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=1359948900">departed</a> for <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/">greener financial pastures</a> in July. Myschyf had this, among other things, to say:<p><B>Last week Lum had asked us to come up with a new name for the site and register a new domain, in effect, turning what we do now-a-days into a successor site. At first, I thought I would continue to write for and manage this successor site. However, I've had a lot of time to think about it this weekend and after careful consideration I am not going to go forward with a new site. <p>...<p>I've said what I had to say about online gaming and I don't have all that much more to say right now. I've found myself slowly becoming more of an editor for other people's articles rather than writing my own and that's not something I enjoy all that much. But I haven't been inspired in quite some time. <p>...<p>What will happen now is that on 9/30 we will take down the site... We will take the money left over in the donation account and, after paying for our surplus bandwidth usage for September, donate the rest to the victims of Tuesday's attack on the WTC and the Pentagon.</B><p>Clearly, Myschyf sounded more than a little burnt out, and the request of Lum the Mad--the person, not the site--to get a new domain name was just the last straw.<p>But faster than you could hit your refresh button, another notice was posted by <a href="mailto:eldin@darktide.org">Eldin</a> that announced he was going to take over the editorial duties from the aforementioned Myschyf and, in fact, the former Lummites were going to reinvent themselves with a new name:<p><B>Lumthemad.net has always been about one thing and one thing only: the community. The writers, editors, and posters of the site have always come here for the community. Feeling a particular affection for all the people whom I have met and communicated with over the past two years, I'm loathe to allow our little town center go. <p>So, I won't. <p>At this time, I'm taking over the administration of the site until I can get in contact with the other editors and writers of the site. Here are the issues facing the site at present, and I hope to have them addressed and resolved before 9/30/2001. <p>--- The site will obtain a new domain name. We will attempt to transfer as much content as humanly possible to the new site. Any writers, editors, and board administrators will be invited to stay with us and continue in their current capacity. <p>--- The message boards will continue in either their current form or a new one of our choosing. <p>--- Donations will continue. </B><p>We wish the staffers at the soon-to-be former Lum the Mad--the site, not the person--the best of luck in the task before them. It's not entirely clear how much of the site infrastructure the staff will be able to take along for the ride, but we're hoping the new site will work pretty much the same way. Then again, we Mobhunters are a nostalgic lot.<p>As for the reasons why Lum the Mad--the person, not the site--decided that his name could no longer be used as the domain of his former site aren't clear. One might speculate that Mythic wouldn't be fond of the idea of having potentially negative press associated with the name of one of their staffers... but then we wouldn't want to start any nasty rumors, so we'll just shut up.<p>Lum the Mad is dead. Long live Lum the Mad!<p><I>Have any unique insights or breaking news? <a href="mailto:support@mobhunter.com">Contact us</a>.</I>
