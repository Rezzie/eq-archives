As I've said many times, spell info makes my eyelids twitch, but thankfully Mobhunter once again calls upon the services of Remelio Gemweaver, who breaks down all the changes far more efficiently than I could.<p>Normally I'd just make this part of the news roundup, but we're talking a <I>really</I> long list here, so if you'd like to read all the gory details then check it out <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=1852193363">here</a>.<p>Thanks again, Remelio!<p><BIG>Toons for Your Toons... or Not</BIG><p>Coming soon to a television near you... it's <a href="http://formula119.com/eqtaa/index2.html">EverQuest: The Animated Adventures</a>. Every Saturday night on Cartoon Network you can join Eileen, Zozo, Tork, Bensaret, and the rest of our heroes as they battle Envie, Mayong Mistmoore, Sir Lucan, and the other forces of evil. Sounds like a terrific series...<p>If only it were real. In case the flashing &quot;Yes, it's a fake&quot; graphic didn't tell you, this cartoon is not real. The Web site is very well done--to the point of being scarily obsessive, really--and it's certainly a great idea, but it just ain't gonna happen. Still, have fun clicking around and reading about the characters, because you'll probably enjoy it.<p>If you need a real EQ illustrated fix, check out the <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/directcurrents/comics/Dec05/evqrk1.html">EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark comic book</a> that came out a while back. Brad McQuaid (/sniff) was the co-writer, and it's actually an interesting story. Brad works in a lot of familiar phrases--the little rogue running back to his party screaming &quot;TRAIN!&quot; was particularly satisfying. It's done in a deluxe format and runs about $6, but I'd say it's worth it for most EQ fans (the generous amount of bare high elf skin alone makes it a great value). The book definitely begs for a sequel, but I guess they'd have to find someone else to write it for them.<p><BIG>Who Needs Noobie Zones Anyway?</BIG><p>Over at the Safehouse, players are <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=10295.topic">reporting</a> that Nektulos Forest has been changed rather significantly on Test server. Orcs were added, halflings were moved, and some relatively higher-level NPCs showed up that aren't necessarily friendly to the native dark elf inhabitants:<p><B>There are three orc camps now. One at the old halfling camp next to Master Whoopal, one by the river on the same side,and a third one that's to the right as you cross the bridge going from Commonlands to Lavastorm. Master Whoopal now has the old halflings from the now-orc camp in a third layer around him-about a dozen halflings,many casters. On the Neriak side of the bridge,there's a stump with a small army of Leatherfoots,and there's also now an area where the guardians used to wander full of undead. A couple of DE NPC's explain the undead rising and why.<p>There's also a few followers of Rodcet Nife there now.</B><p>Whether these new NPCs are merely for quests or whether something more game-shaking is in the works, no one can say. Ever since the Battle of Bloody Kithicor, those dark elves have been making me rather nervous.<p><BIG>The New Math</BIG><p>Also at the Safehouse is a thread that attempts to explain how Verant got rid of the hell levels <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=10285.topic">mathematically</a>. I won't go into it here, but let me just say that if spell parsing makes me woozy, then you can only imagine what this does to me. If you like crunching numbers, though, have a look. If not, just play the game and enjoy the flatter exp curve.<p><BIG>Post-Patch Redux</BIG><p>After the patch yesterday (and the emergency downtime that followed), I was able to play for a few hours and indulge in some of the new goodies bestowed upon us. Here's just a quick recap of my initial thoughts:<p>Chat channels - Cumbersome at first, but great when you get up to speed. The hardest part now will be mentally keeping track of which channel is which. Setting unique colors will definitely help.<p>Hitsmode - Type &quot;/hitsmode&quot; and you'll get a crazy list of variables that will make your skin all itchy. Honestly, I didn't get to play with this yet, as I logged on right in the middle of a raid and didn't have time to fiddle around. The idea is a realy good one, though.<p>Radial Flora - It works, and that's good enough for me.<p>Armor Tinting - This broke my heart. When you activate it with &quot;/dopropertinting on&quot;, you get a message saying you'll see it next time you zone. Actually, you need to camp to desktop and come back. Why did it break my heart? Because on my GeForce 3 with Verant's approved drivers, the parts that should be skin colored are now jet black. Actually, it looks kind of cool on me (I'll add a screenshot later), but other characters look really stupid. I'm not sure what I can do--maybe installing the newer nVidia drivers will help or something. I'd welcome any suggestions you have.<p>Yeah, yeah, I'm obsessed with my looks. Can you blame me? I have a responsibility to the females of my server, you know.
