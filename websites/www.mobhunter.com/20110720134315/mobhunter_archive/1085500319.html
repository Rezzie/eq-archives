<html><head><title>A Whole New Experience</title></head><body><h1>A Whole New Experience</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-05-28</p>People on Test server were treated to the following patch message:<p><B>May 27th, 2003<br>-------------------------<p>** Experience System Change - Grouping **<p>We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in all of EverQuest. At its core, the idea is to positively reinforce grouping. There should never be any penalty to adding &quot;that sixth person over there,&quot; whatever class they may be, into your group. That is exactly the type of behavior that should be rewarded.<p>In a massively multi-player game, any mechanic that penalizes those who group is one that we need to take a serious look at. While there are definite benefits to forming &quot;well balanced&quot; groups in terms of damage, tanking, healing, and support, there shouldn't be an active penalty to those who cannot find groups of &quot;optimal&quot; balance.<p>As it stands in EverQuest, groups gain a 2% to 20% experience bonus, which we refer to as the &quot;group bonus&quot;, for having two to six members. In practice, however, this has never been much of a bonus, even in the case of a full group, given that the experience was already being divided six ways.<p>In the past, we had also attempted to reward people for adventuring in the more challenging Planes of Power zones by making those zones give a better rate of experience.<p>As of this update, groups now gain 20% to 80% &quot;group bonus&quot; experience for having two to five members. <p>Full, six-person, groups now see an additional bonus. Their experience is only divided five ways, yet they still gain the 80% &quot;group bonus.&quot; For those who think in terms of pie charts, it amounts to a larger piece of a larger pie.<p>Accordingly, the bonus inherent to Planes of Power zones will be decreased slightly. However, as long as person is grouped with at least one other, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system. The one down side to the new system is that there will be a slight decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones.<p>We realize that we are, essentially, &quot;manufacturing&quot; a new type of experience after a kill. As players, we also understand it is the people who spend time in full groups who have to deal with the most interruptions and setup time caused by organizing the extra people. It simply makes sense to reward that extra time, especially if it means bringing more people together. After all, that's the whole point.<p>We look forward to seeing how these changes play out on Test Server.<p>** Experience System Change - Level 60+ **<p>In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC levels that give a person experience after they reach level 60. The &quot;blue to 65&quot; range has been increased as far as level 50, with the &quot;light blue&quot; range extending to level 45. The best benefits, however, are still for fighting things around and above your level. <p>The world of EverQuest, at this point in its history, is truly immense and full of the best and most interesting content and visuals out there. Ideally, when a person logs on they should have a wide array of places in which to adventure. The addition of new content shouldn't entirely obsolete what already exists. Hopefully these changes will once again make that the case.</B><p>And so the amount of experience that people get will be increased, and everyone is cheering about it and thanking SOE heartily.<p>The End.<p>...<p>Don't buy it? Oh, you jaded soul.<p>Okay, so not <I>everyone</I> is happy, as if that's any great surprise. What's the cause for alarm? Take a look at this part again:<p><B><I>Accordingly, the bonus inherent to Planes of Power zones will be decreased slightly.... The one down side to the new system is that there will be a slight decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones.</I></B><p>As you'd expect, some members of those classes who tend to solo a lot are up in arms. <A HREF="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=26682.topic">Wizards</A>, <A HREF="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=31173.topic">druids</A>, <A HREF="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=86854">enchanters</A>, and of course <A HREF="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=18520">necros</A> all have some vocal representatives crying foul. But surprisingly, even some <A HREF="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=39476.topic">melee types</A> are managing to turn the change into another anti-SOE crusade. Considering that melee and hybrids who regularly complain about being denied groups stand to gain the most from this change, you'd think they'd be a little more grateful.<p>So do they have a point? All kinds of people are coming up with <A HREF="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=31173.topic&amp;start=58&amp;stop=58">charts</A> that attempt to calculate how the changes will work. Soloers on Test report their exp rate decreasing anywhere from 17% to 30%, depending who is posting. Is this just the latest proof that SOE is out to get soloers?<p>Well, you have to look at the big picture. Now more than ever, EQ is a social game. The current team really, really wants you to group up and meet people. The easiest way to do that is to ensure that those who group--especially in full groups--get the biggest reward for doing so. Substantial experience bonuses are a means to accomplish that end.<p>But why decrease PoP exp? Is SOE giving you a flashy new present with one hand while stealing your wallet with the other?<p>Realistically, there has to be a compromise. PoP zones have much higher ZEMs (zone experience modifiers) than older zones. To simply increase that even more would continue to lock players into a handful of zones because the exp would be too nice to leave. The combined effect of increasing experience for groups and expanding the level range of mobs that give experience should allow players a wider range of zones in which to hunt. After all, getting people to branch out is one of the stated goals here.<p>Unfortunately, this does mean that some players will suffer. Those who choose to solo in Planes of Power will indeed get less experience. But even though some are upset by this fact, other soloers see the wider range of zone choices as a worthwhile tradeoff. It has also been pointed out that soloers in PoP can probably group with a partner and reap the benefits of a group while still essentially soloing.<p>There are potential problems with the system. Some are already drooling at the possible revival of AE exp groups in places like Sebilis and Charasis. Such groups traditionally shun melee types for obvious reasons, and that would probably be the case once again. Additionally, the whole notion of this being a change for the better really hinges on just how much PoP ZEMs are decreased and whether the bonuses actually compensate for that. On paper, they should... but unless it turns out to be noticeable in practice, it's all just smoke and mirrors.<p>Overall, these are good changes that should benefit players. I wouldn't expect to see a night-and-day difference in terms of the exp I get even in a full group, but some visible gain should be there. And if players can revisit older content and be given rewards for doing so, then all the better. While it sucks that soloing takes a hit, EQ is really just falling in line with other games out there as well as those on the horizon. Soloing should remain an option for everyone, but grouping should be encouraged and rewarded. Because in the end, if you aren't grouping and meeting the people who share your community, you're missing out on the greatest part of the EverQuest experience.<p>I think what SOE is getting at is that soloing should be an alternative, not a preferred way to play the game. What I mean is, when a player logs on and wants to get the best exp they can, they should immediately think &quot;I need to go get a group.&quot; For those times when the person wants to be alone, doesn't have a lot of time, or just wants to mess around, they should be able to solo and make some progress. But SOE never wants someone to log in and say &quot;Soloing is the best way to advance my character, so that's what I'm going to do.&quot;<p>At least, that's my theory. Soloing should always be a secondary path to character advancement; grouping should always be preferable. I think the notion of having soloing classes and grouping classes is a paradigm from the old dev team, not the current one.<p>By the same token, all classes should have the option to solo, but obviously they do not. This is because the most effective soloing is done by characters who can avoid nearly all melee damage from a mob (snarers, kiters, pet classes, etc.). If SOE wanted to introduce content that allowed pure melees to solo, they certainly could. All they'd have to do is make mobs with relatively low hitpoints that didn't hit very hard, and make them 100% immune to magic of any kind, including snares and stuns. Casters would leave them alone and melee could pick them off at will. Heck, Fungus Grove would require very little modification to be made into exactly this kind of place.<p>However, I really don't think SOE wants to design content for soloers of any class. Soloers have been carving their own niche for a while now, and it will probably stay that way for the forseeable future. Just don't expect any changes that really encourage the behavior as a practical means of character advancement.
