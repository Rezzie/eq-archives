He found the new starting descriptions for various races that can play a beastlord--that text blurb you get when you finish rolling a new character.<p>Submitted for your approval...<p>Vah'Shir:<p><B>On behalf of the honorable Vah Shir, welcome! You have chosen to journey down a path that is destined to bring great pride to our people. As a Khati Sha you will be particularly in tune with the forces of the spirit world while maintaining the ability to inflict great damage upon your enemies through combat. You will be tasked with the exploration of the unmapped and untamed regions of our new homeworld. Your path enables you to develop a unique influence over certain animals. May they serve you well! This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY</B><p>Iksar:<p><B>Welcome to Cabilis, the new capital of the reborn Iksar Empire. Cabilis, or New Sebilis as some call it, is a great walled city located deep in the heart of Kunark. Before your hatching, the Hierophants of Cabilis detected the strength of your rage and the wisdom of your instincts. It was then that your fate was decided. You were taken outside the walls of Cabilis at the time of your rebirth and sent to live among and dominate the beasts of the wild lands of Kunark. You learned to fight as the beasts do, with tooth, tail, and claw. Like the Scaled Mystics, your devotion to Cazic Thule allows you to contact the spirit realm but while the Scaled Mystics are guided and aided by the spirits of the ancient Iksar, you subjugate the animal spirits to magically aid you and your companions. Many Iksar beastlords serve the Legion of Cabilis as scouts. Know that all other nations upon Norrath fear and dislike the Iksar and cannot be trusted. Only within Cabilis are you truly safe. This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY</B><p>Troll:<p><B>Welcome to Grobb, home of the most vicious race on all of Norrath, the trolls! As a beastlord of the Dark Ones, in service to both Innoruuk and Cazic Thule, you are among the most feral and bloodthirsty of all trolls. You choose to live in the swamps and marshes where you dominate the fiercest of animals to serve you. You seek to slaughter all who cross your path so that you may feast upon their corpses. Like the Dark Ones, you harness the power of your deity to enslave the spirits of the wild and force them to magically aid you and your companions. The beastlords of the Dark Ones frequently encounter violent territorial disputes with the ogre beastlords to the West. Nearly all other humanoids will choose to attack you on sight. This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY</B><p>Ogre:<p><B>Welcome to Oggok, mountain home of the ogres! Your ruthlessness and brutality are exceptional even for one of the ogre race. Your nearly uncontrollable instincts and rage have led you to live among the beasts of the wild, dominating the fiercest animals to serve you. There is no satisfaction greater than crushing your enemies with your bare hands. Like the Shamans of War, you harness the power of Rallos Zek to enslave the spirits of the wild and force them to magically aid you and your companions. The beastlords of the Feerrott frequently encounter violent territorial disputes with the troll beastlords to the East. Beware when travelling, because ogres have a habit of eating most other humanoids, you will be welcome in very few places and attacked on sight in most. This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY</B><p>Barbarian:<p><B>Welcome to Halas, the snowy home of the Northmen! As a beastlord in the service of the Tribunal, you have abandoned the trappings of civilization to live among the wolves, bears, and mammoths of the Everfrost. With your affinity for wild beasts you have learned to fight effectively with your bare hands and tame the most vicious of animals. Furthermore, your devotion to the Six Hammers allows you to contact the spirits of the wild to magically aid you and your companions in your battles. You pursue justice in the wild lands of Norrath where the unjust gather in tribes of bandits, poachers, and murderers. Your primary enemies are the troll and ogre beastlords in the lands far south of Everfrost who wrongly enslave the very spirits you ally with. This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY</B><p>The references to fighting with bare hands and claws certainly sound monkish, and the <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/previews/0,10869,2780291-3,00.html">Gamespot preview</a> from a few weeks back mentions an AC bonus when unarmed combat is used.<p>All this talk has monks wondering whether beastlords will get other monk skills that had previously been reserved only for their class. As monks have seen their uniqueness dwindle ever since the release of Kunark, most are not happy about the implications of the beastlord.<p>Still, it is almost a certainty that beastlords won't have the damage output of a monk without using a pet, and any mage can tell you that pet use has its drawbacks--depending on Verant's pet-aggro-of-the-week modifications.<p>But if we see a bunch of beastlords running around Luclin feigning death, you can be assured that an army of monks will be invading CS Home to teach those Verant folks a lesson.
