<i>Hail citizens of Norrath!<BR>

<BR>

Hear my words, for I bring news of great importance.<BR>

<BR>

Today I present to you an adventure, perhaps the greatest the Lands of Norrath have ever offered. It is a quest of great proportions, and a journey wrought with danger. Fear not though my friends, for the spiritual rewards of this journey far outweigh any hardship involved.<BR>

<BR>

As of now, we are once again gathering an adventuring party to protect and serve the lands of Norrath. Scribes are lining up even now so that they may take your application to become a Guide of Norrath.<BR>

<BR>

We are seeking those strong in character, bright in wit, soft with compassion, and filled with joy.<BR>

<BR>

If you've ever felt good helping a fellow adventurer retrieve his corpse, or with helping someone when they felt all was lost, then this is truly the adventure for you. Or perhaps you feel your sense of humor could bring smiles to the faces of Norrathian citizens. Maybe your renowned acting skills might be of help. If you are kind, compassionate, and helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.<BR>

<BR>

If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be difficult at times. You can be assured that you will be tried... That you will be trued. In the end though, the citizens of Norrath will benefit from your thoughtful participation, and the lands of Norrath will continue to become a better place.<BR>

<BR>

If you feel this is something you must be a part of, then I invite you to point your browser to: http://guideapp.everquest.com<BR>

<BR>

We ask so little of your time, but the benefits you can bring to Norrath are grand.<BR>

<BR>

A few things to remember:<BR>

1) You must have an active, and in good standing, EverQuest account.<BR>

2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.<BR>

3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.<BR>

4) You will need good communication skills.<BR>

5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.<BR>

6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must.<BR>

<BR>

Come one, come all... help us to make the lands of Norrath better than they already are... come be a part of the Everquest Guide Program!<BR>

<BR>

Bad grammar aside (sorry, you can be tried but you can't be trued), the guide program is definitely in need of some good people. If you're prepared for the abuse and actually know what you're doing, consider giving it a shot.
