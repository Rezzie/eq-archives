<html><head><title>Sobering Up</title></head><body><h1>Sobering Up</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-11-12</p><BIG>Fistly News</BIG><p>One of the larger <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=34305.topic">FanFaire reports</a> was posted over on the monk board, with details of interest to several classes.<p>For monks, the big topic was obviously the recent defensive nerf. According to the author, Smaxor:<p><B>Scott Hartsman answered saying: 1) the mitigation nerf did not have the intended effect, 2) they would be revisiting the issue and 3) our mitigation will still not be like it was before. He went on to say that they tested the change extensively with mathmatical models with varying levels of monks and equipment, but the fact was that the model failed when applied to the live servers. The take home lesson though not to be forgotten: they want us to be less defensively capable than a rogue and ranger (chain wearers). End of story. Face to face, he told me that our ranking behind the Knights as secondary tanks as the way it was before the nerf, was wrong. Ironically, when I posed a similar question to Absor in between sessions he simply shruged and said there wasn't much to say, that he thought the team felt the change didn't need a second look. Smaxor smash.</B><p>Rangers were <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=7edbe7ffaaaf3dd6f362ce4d781748d1&amp;threadid=13671

">alarmed</a> to hear that Hartsman was not a big fan of archery in its present incarnation:<p><B>Last note, Scott made many indications he isn't happy with archery as it is currently. He has major beef with endless quiver (a warrior from FoH asked if warriors would ever get an endless quiver AA or something similar and he said nooooo waaaay). He said archery was not meant to be the primary ability of a ranger. He also said that while it is &quot;broken&quot; it isn't outrageously so. By broken I don't think he just meant the whacky amounts of damage rangers can do now. I believe he was also talking about the line-of-sight issues. What it all boils down to though, is I doubt archery will remain as it is now down the road (probably for both good and bad, heh).</B><p>Given recent nerfs to other classes, rangers are a bit jumpy. Yes, archery may be a little too good right now, but the skill is situational enough that it doesn't destroy the game. While there's certainly no need for a ranged autoattack function like many rangers want, neither is there a compelling need to cripple archery as a whole. Hopefully our little woodland friends manage to avoid the nerfbat and steer clear of this <a href="http://www.phank.com/images/11_4/frogdeath.jpg">stormy</a> weather.<p>More things mentioned by the monkly reporter and others who added to the thread:<p>- No evade skill for enchanters<p>- No epic 2.0 weapon quests (though some discussion panels were clearer on this than others)<p>- Parchment drops have been tuned and are as intended<p>- Taunt for warriors will be retuned at some point to reduce the dependency on weapon procs for aggro<p>- Plane of Mischief revamp should be done in a month or two<p>- Graveyards may be added to some non-PoP zones<p>- Buff slots may be increased past 15<p>- Some rare spawns in PoP aren't dropping loot as intended<p>- Sundays and Mondays are the best days for your petition to get a fast answer<p>Hopefully Scott Hartsman or Absor will confirm or deny some of this stuff so that we know what was actually said (or at least intended). Until such time, please remember that none of the above should be treated as gospel truth.<p>Not that you believe anything posted here anyway, but... <p><BIG>Take It Easy, Take It Slow</BIG><p>One of the hotter topics lately has been the way slow spells are currently bugged in PoP, allowing mobs to avoid slows rather than partially mitigating them as intended. Shamans, of course, have a keen interest in this topic, and one FanFaire attendee caught Scott Hartsman to <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=7d289c1f2d033c916717858b31389c06&amp;threadid=7679">ask him a few things</a>:<p><B>First, he acknowledged again as said in his post that they know it is broken at the moment re how mobs are actually reacting. <p>Second, he said that the capability is there for the designers to make the effect random for a given mob, rather than always the same mitigation factor, and even to have the effect vary over the course of the fight. But if I understood him correctly, the current implementation is for a static effect, the same every time from a given mob. <p>Third, he assured us that they will implement a feedback feature which gives the shammy &quot;the information we need&quot; to react appropriately to a partial slow. I assume this will mean feedback so we know whether we should try again to achieve a better result, and to what extent the mob is slowed for healing and other purposes.</B><p>The thread also contains cries for shaman rebalancing and claims that Verant is ignoring the class. I can only assume that none of these people have actually seen a high-level shaman in action, because to claim that this class is underpowered based on the fact that druids and clerics get better heals just boggles me.<p>I will give you that alchemy could use a boost, though.<p><BIG>Vegas, Baby, Vegas!</BIG><p>As the wizards at Graffe's lamented that they had no official representative attending the SF event, <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=22843.topic">discussion</a> came up as to where the next FanFaire would be held. While not set in stone, word is that the likely target is Las Vegas in March.<p>Though east-coasters and mid-westerners are feeling overlooked, Vegas is the best location for all concerned. First off, March still qualifies as winter in many parts of the US, and we all know that southern Californians aren't anywhere near hardy enough to withstand potentially snowy weather. Second, Vegas is about the cheapest place in the country for people to fly to and stay for a few days--airfaire is always low, and package deals with hotel rooms are extremely reasonable. The casinos tend to make the trip pricey, but if you can successfully evade them, you're in good shape.<p>Kohath, Csenicier, and I already took a blood oath that we would attend a Vegas FanFaire, so you can bank on us being there. Of course, I don't know if that's incentive for you to come or to stay away, but you have a few months to figure out that little quandry.<br>
