(SOE), a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online gaming, announced today that its flagship product, EverQuest&reg;, is coming to the Mac.  SOE became an official online gaming developer for the Mac in January and has made its top games at The Station&reg; (www.station.com), such as Wheel of Fortune Online and Jeopardy! Online, available to the more than 25 million Mac users. <p>&quot;Supporting the Mac platform is a logical step towards growing our online community and building the most complete, interactive experience for gamers,&quot; said Scott McDaniel, Vice President of Marketing, Sony Online Entertainment.  &quot;Combine the power and stability of Mac OS X with Apple's outstanding desktop systems and you've got an incredible gaming environment that'll take full advantage of EverQuest's huge and seamless 3D world.&quot; <p>&quot;Mac OS X is awesome for playing games that involve fast-paced, high-end 3D graphics and visual effects because the most robust graphics technologies are built right into the operating system's core,&quot; said Ron Okamoto, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations.  &quot;EverQuest is a hugely successful game that delivers cutting-edge character development and player interaction. We're thrilled that EverQuest will take advantage of Mac OS X's advanced capabilities and provide a wonderful experience for our gamers.&quot;<p>In the Spring of 2003, Mac users can purchase the original EverQuest and the top-selling expansion packs including: The Shadows of Luclin(TM), The Ruins of Kunark(TM) and The Scars of Velious(TM).</B><p>What are we, prophets? It was only a month ago that we asked Scott Hartsman in an <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-1726225056">interview</a> whether we'd see EQ on the Mac, since <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/top_news_item.cfm?NewsID=4522">DirectX support</a> had become available. His response:<p><B>We consider all kinds of things, all the time. :) Personally, I'd enjoy seeing EQ on everything from Mac, to Linux, to my cell phone, and perhaps even my gas grill. (It's got a little window in the front.)<p>Again, though, it's all a matter of how many developers can work with the same source code at a single time without slowing the others down. I'd rather get the backlog of items that people are expecting, done, before we talk about the potential for new, major technology pieces.</B><p>Either Hartsman is a cagey bastard (which is probably true in any case) or Verant got the idea of porting EQ to the Mac from us. In which case Mac users everywhere now owe Mobhunter a huge debt and may begin sending big phat checks to us care of yours truly.<p>Hey, a girl can dream, can't he?<p>Now, of course, it's only a matter of time before Amiga users start clammoring for an EQ port. Csenicier is digging his Color Computer out of the garage as I write this in hopes of a CoCo version. Me, I've got the Atari ST all fired up and ready to load the game via the trusty ol' floppy drive.
