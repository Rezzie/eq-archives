Turns out soul binders made pretty good training <a href="http://petemoss.com/spamflames/ShifmanIsAMoronSpammer.html">dummies</a>, due to the fact that they were high level, had tons of hit points, and didn't hit you back. In other words, you could auto-attack, walk away, and come back to find your combat skills maxed with no fear of dying.<p>Well, turns out the soul binders are mad as hell and aren't going to take it anymore. All city zones with soul binders were taken down for a patch, and when they came back up the soul binders <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=20297.topic">had a new plan</a>. They de-leveled themselves (maybe they want to go on Vox/Naggy raids or something) so that they con green to pretty much everyone. Thus, attacking them won't raise your melee skills.<p>I remember being able to do this on the Iksar vendor in Dreadlands when he first showed up, but he was fixed in short order. Oh well, <a href="http://yugop.com/ver3/stuff/03/fla.html">time</a> to raise combat skills the old-fashioned way.<p><BIG>Your Beastlord's AC is Working as Intended</BIG><p>Are you playing a beastlord? Wondering where the promised AC bonus is? You're not alone.<p>Over at the Safehouse, they're <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9456.topic">discussing</a> just this issue--in no small detail. Absor popped up on Dev Corner to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000453.html">address it</a> as well:<p><B>Beastlords do get a native armor class bonus. This bonus is not affected by the weight the Beastlord carries like the Monk's is, but it isn't as good as the one that Monks get either...<p>The Beastlord is restricted to 'leather' armor. So AC on Beastlord armor is going to be lower than most classes. Armor for Beastlords is indeed rather similar than that of Monks. In exchange for Monkish armor and a resultant lesser AC in general (because Monks have that higher bonus), Beastlords get a bunch of other things, like pets, spells and such. The low weight on these items is pretty much just a bonus, and isn't meant to indicate that the Beastlord needs to carry less weight. The items are just lighter.</B><p>So, the armor bonus is out there somewhere. Maybe your pet can help you find it.<p><BIG>Get a Move On</BIG><p>No sooner do we respond to a <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-778410717">question</a> about character transfers than Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000454.html">announces</a> that they've opened up again:<p><B>We're sorry for the delay in the return of this service. But it is back up and available for your use.</B><p>So if you've been saving your pennies in hopes of moving to a new server and <a href="http://www.meet-an-inmate.com">finding your true love</a>, now's your chance.<p><BIG>Wizards Nerfed Again!</BIG><p>I throw <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000452.html">this</a> in only for the sake of my favorite translocaters:<p><B>With the next patch, the Sages Crown (Thurgadin Wizard quest helm), and the Icicle Circlet (Skyshrine Wizard quest helm) will be changed to NO DROP to match all other Velious class quest armor. So if you've borrowed one of these items from a friend or guildmate you should return them as soon as you can.</B><p>Can you see the auctions in GFay?<p><small>/au WTS sages crown, 00ber wiz helm soon 2B nodrop--200K</small><p>Sell 'em now, wizzies!<p><BIG>Easier Access to the Winter Wonderland?</BIG><p>Someone over at Monkly-Business is <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=20306.topic">reporting</a> that there is now a Nexus port to Velious on Test server. It reportedly takes intrepid travellers to the giant spires in the Great Divide.<p>As of this writing we haven't gotten confirmation on this, so don't consider it gospel yet. If true, it would certainly be a neat trick as to where the Velious porter in Nexus would be located. After all, there are four wings to the Nexus, and there are already portals for Antonica, Faydwer, Odus, and Kunark.<p>A portal to GD does make sense--after all, those are large Combine spires in the snow. Of course, frost giants roam all around the area, so those of you friendly with the dwarves or dragons may find yourselves feeling a bit <a href="http://www.armory.com/~moke/mouse.html">trapped</a>. But if this portal turns out to be real, melee would have almost no reason to bind anywhere but the Nexus.<p><BIG>More Maps</BIG><p>Muse at <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/">EQ Atlas</a> has a few more Luclin maps posted. Up this time: Mons Letalis, Sanctus Seru, and The Grey. The maps do their usual fine job of helping you navigate the lunar landscape.<p>Have a nice weekend, folks. Now where is that Guinness...
