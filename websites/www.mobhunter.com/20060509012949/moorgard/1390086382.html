Rod Humble and Robert Pfister--two of the reigning bigwigs at SOE--revealed a few further details on the next expansion in a <A HREF="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/everquestlostdungeonsofnorrath/preview_6030604.html">GameSpot interview</a>. Nothing earth-shaking here, really, but there are a couple things worth pointing out. First, a firm ship date has been carved in stone as <B>September 9th.</b> Here's the Cliff's Notes version from Pfister:<p><B>There are five dungeon themes. Each theme has multiple flavors to it, and each instance created has content designed for that group. Each of the dungeons (more than 40 in all) will have a unique layout, special points of interest, and in several cases a unique sub-theme. We are not randomly generating art in this expansion. Each dungeon is hand-crafted and pushes up the bar for what we can do with our engine. The layouts, objects, textures, and lighting really come together to produce some of the most exciting dungeons to date. As for the amount of content each dungeon will have, it depends upon the level of the group playing, the adventure selected, and the usual unforeseen dangers, but sessions should take anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes to complete.</b><p>Like the last expan--sorry, <I>extension</i>--Legacy of Ykesha, LDoN will be available via download. Presumably SOE will allow customers to pre-download bits and pieces prior to 9/9 so that the servers aren't an absolute zoo upon release. Humble points out:<p><B>Keep in mind that Lost Dungeons will be a far larger download than Legacy of Ykesha was.</b><p>And lest ye buy into the paranoia that SOE is trying to kill off EQ in favor of EQ2, Humble offers comfort to those dedicated to the current incarnation of Norrath:<p><B>You can count on another expansion in spring 2004. We have others planned, but marketing gets unhappy if we talk about things too far out.</b><p>Oh, and if you were scared that LDoN would be filled only with new models at the expense of your dear old friends, you can ease your furrowed brow. That's right, Bobby, <A HREF="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/everquestlostdungeonsofnorrath/screens_6030604.html?page=4">it's a froglok</a>. Looks like it's really EverQuest after all.<p>SOE people are going out of their way to state over and over again that they have no plans to kill EverQuest when EQ2 rolls out. Should you believe them, or is it just marketing hype? Well, think logically. The All Access subscription lets you play a bevy of Sony games for one price. Why should SOE care which game you play when they are likely to make the same amount of money regardless? Plus, they have a stable (stop chuckling!) product in EverQuest that is a known quantity and an established brand. They'd be foolish to scrap that in an effort to get people to move to a whole new game. Besides, EQ2 isn't going to have the depth of content that EQ currently has for years, so the expanding world of classic EQ is still going to appeal to many players for a long time.<p>Personally, I'd just like to see Rod Humble legally change his name to Humble Humble. Then he'd almost be a Nabokov character.<p>That's a literary reference, for those of you scratching your heads. Who says an English degree isn't good for anything?<p><BIG>Nice Chest, Honey</big><p>Things in Plane of Time have been quiet lately. Sure, there's the occasional problem or complaint, but it seems that most uberguilds have been discreetly farming away, pushing deeper and deeper into the plane.<p>Apart from the parade of to-drool-for drops that have become the norm, one set of items has been noticably absent from the game: elemental tunic molds. It was clear that they had to come from Time, because countless hours of farming in Fire, Earth, Air, and Water certainly hadn't revealed any. While the BPs showed up on Lucy, those were the result of database digging; none had actually appeared in the hands of players.<p>All that has changed. Among the guilds breaching the fifth tier of Time, <A HREF="http://www.townrebels.org/">Township Rebellion</a> has become the first to see an elemental tunic mold drop. And, uh, the result is kinda nice, what with 210 HP, 20 to all saves, and sweet effects that are tailored to the rogue class.<p>Unless Time-enabled guilds have been extremely unlucky, or unless tunic patterns were just added to the drop tables, elemental BPs seem like they will be rare finds. Still, we'll be anxious to see what other classes get. Hopefully they'll be as handy for every class as the rogue version is. But I guess Time will tell.<p>Have I used that one yet? It gets so hard to tell some Times.<p><BIG>Boys Against Girls</big><p>&quot;I can do anything you can do, better&quot; goes the old song, though it seems we need to add the awkward line &quot;except sell on eBay.&quot;<p>A recent study by an EQ-addicted assistant professor of economics recently <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/modules/exports/ct_email.asp?/news/930462.asp">made the news</a> a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993864">couple of times</a>, coming to the conclusion that male characters sell for more real-world cash than female toons do. In fact, virtual chicks are valued at 12% less than comparably equipped (if you know what I mean) males.<p>Why? The professor explains:<p><B>Castronova said he played the game as a female character a number of times, and would inevitably find other players assuming he was less knowledgeable or skilled.<p>&quot;I'm pretty experienced, but I'd still get people coming up to me and saying, 'OK, honey, stand over there and watch what I do,' &quot; he said. &quot;Even though everybody knows the person behind the avatar could be either sex, the male avatars tend to be treated as more skilled. ... We've just taken sex roles from Earth and put them into Norrath.&quot;</b><p>Seems fair to me. Obviously women aren't as capable as men, so any woman thinking she can be as skilled as a man in EQ is sadly--<p>/pauses to dodge the barrage of sharp objects thrown at him<p>Hey, I was just kidding! Women and men doing the same job deserve the same compensation, in life and in EQ.<p>However, it's hard to conclude that sexism is the only reason for the discrepancy in auction prices. Maybe male characters sell for more because it's mostly men who buy characters via auction, and they generally prefer to play males. I think to be completely valid, this study would have to include data on the people who shop for characters. It's highly unlikely, in my opinion, that the people who bought the toons had no personal preference whatsoever in which sex they wanted the character to be. If most buyers want male characters for roleplay reasons--or simply because they are male and identify better with a male character--then those decisions don't indicate sexism, but simply illustrate how supply and demand works. Of course the male toons would sell higher, because there is more demand for them.<p>Nor does the study touch on the benefits of playing a female character. Some guys have gone on record that they play female toons because other players are nicer to them and give them stuff. Now <I>that</i> indicates sexism, or at least an imbalance somewhere, because males are nice to female characters for the same reason men are nice to pretty ladies in real life: so they can get them in the sack.<p>Before the guys take their turn throwing stuff at me, let me be clear that not <I>all</i> guys have that motivation. But c'mon, fellas, you can't tell me that most of you haven't been moved to generosity by a giggle and a wink from a friendly (apparently) female elf or two somewhere along the line.<p>Not that *I* have fallen into that trap, of course, but other guys certainly have. I'm far too focused and dedicated in game to be distracted by such carnalities.<p>And by the way, anyone posting a contradiction to that statement who claims to be from my guild or server is lying. Lying, I tell you!
