<html><head><title>Walking on Broken Glass</title></head><body><h1>Walking on Broken Glass</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-05-30</p><BIG>No &quot;Soloing&quot; for You, I Guess</BIG><p>Yesterday we reported about Verant's EverQuest account key giveaway. Well, quite a few people are noticing that they didn't receive the Sony e-mail that contained the key.<p>To check whether or not you were supposed to get the newsletter, follow the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/newsletter.jsp">instructions</a> on the Harpy's Head Herald page:<p><B>Launch EverQuest <br>Click Change Account <br>Log In <br>Click Edit Registration <br>Make any updates to your personal information, then click next <br>Click Next again if no changes are needed <br>Check yes for &quot;Do you want to receive future Station emails with announcements of new games, contests, and more?&quot; <br>Click Finish </B><p>If you weren't signed up, don't feel bad. How is anyone supposed to know that it's a newsletter signup? The description sounds to me like junk mail, and anyone who's been on the Net for more than a couple hours knows better than to check little boxes that will get you spammed. Verant really needs to update that registration page with some clearer information--not to mention those system spec dropdowns. My computer was built in <a href="http://www.urbanreflex.com/may24_02/record.html">this century</a>, thanks.<p>Unfortunately, those who weren't signed up for the newsletter in time to catch the mass mailing are out of <a href="http://www.news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?id=561752002&amp;tid=1">luck</a>, according to Absor. The whole process was automated or something, and it can't really be done again to catch the ones who would have liked a key but weren't signed up.<p><BIG>We Don't Do Windows (Anymore)</BIG><p>Verant slipped a stealth file patch in this morning, ostensibly to announce that <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000585.html">Boston FanFaire registration is open</a>. Besides updating the eqnews.txt file, we also got a new version of the eqmain.dll.<p>Lord knows patched files are nothing to write home about, but it turns out the new .dll has a side effect that some people won't like: it makes the keyboard not function under EQ Windows.<p>EQW is a program that's illegal to use, so of course we at Mobhunter don't know much about it. But we're told that it allows you to play EverQuest in a window rather than full-screen mode. It doesn't hack your account or allow you to do other things you shouldn't; it just lets you play in a window. At least, that's what we're told. Anyway, many EQW users are already <a href="http://www.hackersquest.org/boards/viewforum.php?f=12">aware</a> of this news, and are awaiting a new version of the program that will work with the new .dll file.<p>Why doesn't Verant want you to play EQ in a window? They don't like the idea of people running other programs while playing EQ that <I>might</I> interfere with the way the game is supposed to work. However, just imagine if you <I>could</I> play the game in a window. It would be really handy to stay on top of your e-mail, maybe look up item information on a raid, or view the map for a zone you're not familiar with. Seems like a good idea to me. But since it's illegal, I guess we'll never know what it <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0221/taormino.php">feels</a> like.<p>(Note: If you post a comment that illustrates that you are a user of EQ Windows, please post anonymously. Mobhunter doesn't want to be the reason your account got banned.)<p><BIG>The Alan Report</BIG><p>Absor, just returned from <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000587.html">vacation</a> (no, he wasn't with me in Las Vegas!), stopped by Dev Corner to tell anxious paladins that <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000588.html">Sir Lucan's spawn</a> is broken, but should be fixed next patch.<p>He also assured folks that rumors of a product called <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000589.html">Exodus</a>, supposedly announced at E3 as a means to migrate everyone to EQ2 so that Verant could shut down EQ1, are false. Even if that was Sony's secret plan, they'd never choose such an obvious <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/paperboy/text/sports/693477sports05-26-02.htm">name</a>. Absor gave a warm, fuzzy speech about Classic EQ's lifespan:<p><B>We do not plan to stop working on EverQuest until you folks decide it's time for us to stop. It's your participation in the endeavor that will keep us going. For as long as you want to play our game, we'll continue to do our best to entertain you.</B><p>I'm pretty sure money fits in there somewhere, too.<p>Absor also posted a couple other things, but we told you about them already in previous stories, so we won't repeat them here. Mobhunter is faster than Absor!
