<html><head><title>Welcome to Plainer Advancement</title></head><body><h1>Welcome to Plainer Advancement</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-09-25</p><BIG>I Feel So Advanced</big><p>Seems like the ball started rolling on the <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=22998da3019756811945aaf4cde95e9e&amp;threadid=2994">FoH boards</a> and went from there. We'll put the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=234821473">complete (as of now) list</a> for you on a separate page in case you want to browse it, but here are some of the more interesting abilities:<p><B>Planar Power<br>This ability raises the maximum that your statistics can be raised to, with items or spells, by 5 points per rank. You may train in this ability twice each level, beginning at level 61.</b><p>This is fairly significant, as it seems the stat cap of 255 will finally be broken. All total, you'll be able to get an additional 50 points, raising the cap to 305 at a fully trained level 65.<p>How useful will this be? Well, you can get more hitpoints via stamina, but beyond that it's hard to say. We'll presume you will get more mana from the added WIS/INT, but those are the kinds of details you just don't want to take for granted quite yet.<p><B>Planar Durability<br>The planes demand a certain hardiness of those who adventure within. Each rank of this ability adds an additional 5% to your maximum hit points. You may train in this ability once each level, beginning at level 61.</b><p>Surprise, surprise, more hitpoints--an additional 25% to your base HP, no less. Welcome to the age of warriors with 9K+ hitpoints, hybrids with well over 8K, monks and rogues with upper 7K+, and even hearty casters.<p>Insert predictable MUDflation comment here. Go on, do it!<p><B>Innate Enlightenment<br>Those who have meditated on the plains of Tranquility find themselves able to expand their capacity of both Insight and Intellect. Each rank of this ability raises the maximum that you may raise your Intelligence and Wisdom by ten points. You may train in this ability once each level, beginning at level 61.</b><p>Did I say the stat cap would be 305? Scratch that. Presuming this baby stacks with the ability above, WIS and INT can be raised to 355. Mo mana, mo mana, mo mana!<p>Besides the caps going up, there will be the typical base stat and resistance boosts like we saw with Luclin. But beyond that, most of the abilities listed so far are just improvements on the already existing AAXP system (making a few of the obscure ones perhaps marginally useful now). There are a few skills worthy of commentary, however:<p><B>Mastery of the Past<br>This ability makes it impossible for you to fizzle a spell. The first level affects all spells below level 54. The second, on all spells below level 56. The third, on all spells below level 58. You may train in this ability once each level, upon reaching levels 62, 63, and 64.</b><p>This one is pretty nifty. Nothing like pulling the whole temple in CT to your party and screaming &quot;EVAC!!!&quot; only to see your druid fizzle on a low-level spell.<p><B>Suspended Minion<br>This ability grants the summoner the ability to suspend and recall their existing pet at will. The first rank suspends the pet at its current health only, while the second rank suspends the pet with all of its beneficial effects as well as its weapons and armor. You may train the first rank upon reaching level 62 and the second rank upon reaching level 64.</b><p>Saving pet buffs? A novel concept. We wonder how long the pet data is stored--as long as you're in the same zone, the same gaming session, or some other duration.<p><B>Lightning Reflexes<br>This ability further increases your chance of completely avoiding incoming melee damage. You may train in this ability once each level after reaching level 61.<p>Innate Defense<br>This ability further increases your mitigation of incoming melee damage. You may train in this ability once each level after reaching level 61.</b><p>Monks will finally be completely invincible! Mwahahahaha!<p><B>Mithaniel's Binding<br>This ability further increases the amount of healing provided by a single bandage while binding wounds. The two ranks of this ability may be trained at or after levels 63 and 64.</b><p>I spoke too soon. Looks like warriors will be able to CH themselves with two banadages. Doh!<p><B>Animation Empathy<br>Progressive ranks of this ability grant you finer control over your animations. At its initial level, you are allowed to give your animations 'guard' and 'follow' commands. At the second rank, 'attack' commands. At the final rank, 'back off' commands. You gain the ability to train an additional rank at levels 61, 63, and 65.</b><p>A real pet for enchanters?<p><B>Unfailing Divinity<br>The most devout find that their calls are answered with much greater frequency. This ability grants your Death Pact-type spells a second chance to successfully heal their target. Additional ranks of this ability cause said spells to do a portion of their healing value even on a complete failure. You gain the ability to train an additional rank at levels 61, 63, and 65.</b><p>No one dies. Ever.<p><B>Feigned Minion<br>This ability allows you to instruct your pet to feign death via the '/pet feign' command. Three ranks of this skill are available, causing your pet to succeed 25%, 50%, and 75% of the time, respectively. You gain the ability to train an additional rank at levels 61, 63, and 65.</b><p>Uh oh. Looks like I'm out of a job. Mage pets will be pulling Vex Thal now.<p><B>Vanishing Blade<br>The ability allows you to strike your opponents with such speed that they are frequently left dumbfounded, not entirely certain of where the blow originated. You gain the ability to train an additional rank at levels 61, 63, and 65.</b><p>Whatever class gets this would seem to gain a non-aggro attack. Just what rogues need to finally be balanced! /giggle<p><B>Shroud of Stealth<br>This ability provides a previously unheard of level of stealth. The Rogue is able to draw shadows about himself so completely, even creatures that are normally not fooled by such trickery are frequently unable to see him. You may train in this ability upon reaching level 63.</b><p>Invis that even see invis doesn't work on? Cool concept. I can hear the red server people screaming now.<p><B>Host of the Elements<br>This ability calls an assault of elemental minions into existence directed at a target. The minions attack the target without question until they are called back to their plane 6 seconds later. The initial rank of this ability calls five elementals. Additional ranks add two elementals each. You may train the ranks of this ability at or after levels 63, 64, and 65.</b><p>Are your framerates too high? Here's the solution. Invite ten level 65 mages on your raid and have them all use this ability. Your fondness for slideshows will be well rewarded. Okay, who's up for raiding Plane of Sky?<p>Okay, I'll grant you, it's a bit early to treat this stuff as gospel, since it only arrived on Test server yesterday. Plus, we don't even know how the planar points system will work, really. Will you only be able to rack up points in the Planes of Power themselves? Or will there be yet another setting into which you can pour exp that is gained anywhere?<p>At any rate, the path of advancement seems pretty clear. First get to level 65 (many will have it inside a week), then build your planar abilities. This is assuming, of course, that you are already level 60 with a boatload of AA skills. If not, then you'll probably continue to wallow in non-skilledness (new word!) for even longer.<p>There is a fair amount of criticism around the boards that the Plainer... um, Planar Abilities lack imagination. Well, some more interesting and unique additions would certainly be welcome on this list. But I wonder how far Verant could really go with these skills before utterly breaking the game. Seems to me like a lot of these abilities run that risk already.<p>As soon as the Planes open, prepare for the rush of campers looking for those pre-nerf exp spots. Expect to see lots of monks and clerics soloing, lots of druids and wizards quad-kiting, and lots of warriors with LFG flags on.<p>It's off to the races again, folks.
