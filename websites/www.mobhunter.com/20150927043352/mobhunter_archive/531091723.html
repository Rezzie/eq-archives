Sigil Games Online was formed by two of the game industry's most renowned designers, Brad McQuaid, co-creator of the revolutionary, massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;EverQuest&reg;,&quot; and Jeff Butler, former producer of the EverQuest Live and Expansion teams.<p>&quot;This relationship will further strengthen Microsoft's position in the industry as a premier publisher and incubator of high-quality games and innovative content,&quot; said Stuart Moulder, general manager at Microsoft Game Studios. &quot;Brad and Jeff's skill in creating compelling and immersive gaming worlds, combined with our commitment to supporting our development partners, will create a rich opportunity to develop exciting new game environments and experiences.&quot;<p>&quot;This is a match made in heaven,&quot; said McQuaid, CEO of Sigil Games Online. &quot;We couldn't have found a better publisher. Microsoft understands our ideas and goals, is committed to creating a superior gaming experience, and has the industry expertise to make it happen.&quot;<p>Specific details regarding content and timing will be announced later.</B><p>The rest of the press release is <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/020516/sfth025_1.html">here</a> if you really need to see it. News.com is also <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-915284.html?tag=fd_top">reporting</a> the story.<p>Is this news majorly surprising? Not really. We all knew Sigil was going to look for a big fish to publish its games--and who better to compete with Sony than its console rival Microsoft?<p>Just how this will affect Microsoft's other MMORPG offerings--Asheron's Call and the pending Asheron's Call 2--remains to be seen. Likely, all games will find a way to coexist.<p>Also unknown is just how tied Sigil's games will be to the whole Microsoft online infrastructure. Given the multitude of <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-911705.html">service outages</a> MSN and the Games Zone networks have, we're hopeful that Sigil will maintain some degree of autonomy.<p>Yeah, we know--we're playing into that whole &quot;Microsoft is the devil&quot; notion that's been popular ever since, oh, <B>Microsoft first started screwing people over decades ago.</B> We hope for Brad's sake that the publishing deal will keep Microsoft's hands off of any content or design decisions.<p>Hey, do <I>you</I> want what might be your next online game to be messed with by the crack team that brought you gems like Bob and Windows ME?<p>Didn't think so.
