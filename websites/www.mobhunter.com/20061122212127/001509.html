<h1 class="article_title">The State of the Equipment Gap</h1>
<p>by Loral on November 18, 2006</p>

<p>During the initial dark days of the release of Planes of Power, life was hard for non-raiders. Experience rewards had dried up for levels above 60 and the available unflagged hunting areas in the Planes were few.</p>

<p>For weeks I ran a Sunday morning Plane of Justice Executioner Trial event that would help non-raiders get into Valor and Storm so they could find areas worth hunting in. These trials, tuned for "high level players" proved nearly impossible for lower-equipped players. The way I got around this was easy: I brought in a ringer. High-end raiders from Luclin had no problem getting through these trials yet non-raiders could barely get through a trial without wiping out in the first encounter. This was my first experience with the danger of the equipment gap.</p>

<p>Few topics get as much attention or as much excitement as the discussion of the equipment gap. Often these discussions begin focused around a specific circumstance, for example the power of a new piece of armor dropping in Ashengate, but degenerate into large and long winded arguments about the core reward system found across Everquest over the past seven years.</p>

<p>While many equipment gap discussions can be easily discounted and ignored with no harm to either the players or the game, there are some important things for players and designers to both consider.</p>

<p>First, let us scope our discussion. </p>

<p>We will define the term "equipment gap" as the gap in statistical power between level 75 gear available to non-raiding high-end level 75 players, and the statistical power of level 75 high-end raid-level gear. Other power levels in older raid content will also be discussed and compared to current level 75 non-raid gear.</p>

<p>There are many zones in which the equipment rewards given are less<br />
powerful than that which is required simply to enter the zone, let<br />
alone defeating any of the bosses.  One such zone is the Theater of<br />
Blood.</p>

<p>We will define "raid equipment" as any equipment that requires more than six people to acquire. We will also define "raid equipment" as any equipment that can only be accessed by those with a raid flag or those with equipment acquired in raids.</p>

<p>We will define "raids" as any event that requires more than six people.</p>

<p>We will scope the whole topic of the equipment gap at levels 71 to 75. Any characters lower than 71 can probably find equipment of sufficient power to hunt in zones for the experience required to take them to level 75. However, it is important to note that level 65 raid gear still outstrips level 75 single group gear in some areas like Tacvi.</p>

<p>We will not define "casual" or "hard core" or "uber" in this article - they are meaningless and worthless terms.</p>

<p>So, with thos caveats laid out, lets look at the current state of the equipment gap and why it is an important point to consider.</p>

<p>The following helmet is the highest powered helmet available to a single-group level 75 cleric. It requires drops from a rare mob in Sunderock Springs, three more common drops from Direwind, and a Softly Glowing Powersource that drops very rarely in Vergalid Mines or Valdeholm, two level 70+ dungeons in TSS:</p>

<p>Mana-Fused Plate Helm<br />
AC: 55<br />
STR: +14 CHA: +15 WIS: +16 AGI: +13 HP: +215 MANA: +225<br />
SV FIRE: +10 SV DISEASE: +13 SV COLD: +12 SV POISON: +15<br />
Shielding: +2% Regeneration: +3 Mana Regeneration: +2<br />
Effect: Truesight (Worn) at Level 75</p>

<p>This next helmet is a raid-level cleric helmet available in the high-end raiding zones in TSS:</p>

<p>Mysaphar's Spiritmind Helm<br />
AC: 70<br />
STR: +30 STA: +30 CHA: +25 WIS: +35 AGI: +20 HP: +445 MANA: +455<br />
SV FIRE: +30 SV COLD: +35 SV MAGIC: +25 SV POISON: +35<br />
Shielding: +2% DoT Shielding: +4% Mana Regeneration: +3 Damage Shield: +3<br />
Effect: Faerune (Worn) at Level 75</p>

<p>When you consider the power of augments available at both of these areas of the game, the statistics get even more wide-spread, with a high-end of about 315 mana for a single-group equipped character and up to 650 for a raid-level equipped character - both at level 75.</p>

<p>With the release of The Serpent's Spine, the equipment gap between raiders and non-raiders is larger than it has ever been before. While single-group equipment power has gone up significantly since the previous expansions, it has not yet outstripped raid-level equipment released six expansion's ago even though that equipment was designed around characters ten levels lower than the current level cap.</p>

<p>One has to go back to early Gates of Discord and even Planes of Power in some cases to find equipment dropping in raids that is less powerful than the gear available to single group level 75 players in the most recent expansion.</p>

<p>Why does equipment matter?</p>

<p>Some specifics aside, and as a general rule of thumb, equipment power equals about 1/2 of the power of the character barring big discrepencies in alternate abilities. From the standpoint of raw numerical statistics, about half of the hitpoints and mana of a character can come from equipment. With level 75 Ashengate-level raid gear just about doubling the power of level 75 Ashengate single-group gear, a raider can be just about 150% more powerful than a non-raider at level 75 due to equipment alone.</p>

<p>Of course, this discounts a few important factors such as alternate abilities and player skill which can dramatically change the overall power of a character but these variables stacked with the variables in equipment power make it even more difficult to balance content.</p>

<p>The arbitrary numbers associated with gear don't matter outside of the game. There is no real extra joy that comes from a pair of 450 mana boots over a pair of 250 mana boots. The real problem comes from SOE's inability to properly balance content at the highest level. SOE isn't alone in this - Blizzard shows that they have the same trouble even more so in battlegrounds where two level 60 players will have dramatically different abilities to defeat opponents based on gear alone.</p>

<p>The gap in power between raiders and non-raiders makes it very difficult to properly balance content and SOE has proven unsuccessful almost all the way back to Planes of Power.</p>

<p>In Depths of Darkhollow, SOE attempted to account for the equipment gap by offering "Normal" and "Hard" selections on single-group missions. However, some "Normal" missions still proved far too hard for those without some type of raid-level equipment and "Hard" missions were still trivial to raiders wearing the highest-end armor from one or two expansions back.</p>

<p>The wide range of equipment power makes it impossible to pinpoint any setting of "normal" or "hard. Most content is tuned somewhere in between but ends up being only useful for a very select audience.</p>

<p>We saw this with Ashengate where SOE admitted that the range in equipment power meant that the zone would have been unusable to a large section of the player-base. However, in the tuning, they made it trivial for high-end raiders even before those raiders geared up on the new TSS raid armor.</p>

<p>The player gap is an important problem simply because properly tuning single-group content at the high end has proven unsuccessful for nearly eight of the twelve expansions.</p>

<p>What can be done to solve this?</p>

<p>There are a variety of methods to look into this problem, but the one that comes easily to mind is to simply reduce the gap. Offer higher-end armor for non-raiders and make it easier to acquire.</p>

<p>SOE should decide now how far back raid content should go before becoming obsolete. Particularly on level-cap increasing expansions, gear power should jump more significantly than it has in the past. For example, with the release of The Serpent's Spine, SOE could have decided that any gear found in high-end raids before the Citadel of Anguish in Omens of War should be easier to acquire for level 75 single-group hunters in TSS.</p>

<p>Raid content is important to keep alive, so improving it any more than that would make too much raid content obsolete and remove a lot of the entertainment found in places like Anguish, the DON dragons, DODH, and POR raids.</p>

<p>How would these changes improve the game?</p>

<p>Reducing the equipment gap helps the game in three ways:</p>

<p>First, it helps SOE properly tune content for certain level ranges instead of tuning around one point in a huge spectrum of player powers.</p>

<p>Second, it helps guilds gear up without having to repeatedly fight through very old raid content just to power up new members.</p>

<p>Third, it helps smooth the path for non-raiders to enter the raiding game. The raid game is a clear advantage of Everquest over competing massive online games. SOE should do what it can to make it easier for newer players to enter this area of the game's focus.</p>

<p>The power level that SOE decides to release for single-group and raid-level equipment in each expansion can have repercussions that last for years. It is important that SOE structure the power levels of equipment and thus improve their ability to properly tune high-end content.</p>

<p>This is probably one of the fundemental debates at the heart of everquest, & you raise an important point in terms of how to tune current group content.</p>

<p>With a huge gap in gear currently existing being a big part of the problem as regards developing group content that is suitably challenging & rewarding & then being able to apply that in such a way as high end raiders can also enjoy it is currently hugely problematic & so far totally unsuccesful.</p>

<p>I think though that group aquired gear should be less about farming a few rare items, the last thing everquest needs is yet more timesinks, rather I'd like to see rewarding group tasks that are also complex & tough challenges, yet designed for players with less than raid gear, if designed in the next expansion for players with tss group gear that might prove to be a useful starting point, to offering gear with a much closer to raid gear "power level".</p>

<p>This "power level" is what lies at the core, where do we as players see that the line should be? It should be there, no doubt, both to act as an incentive to improve a player's character, but also to define the strata within the games many expansions, raid gear if you have been a raider from PoP onwards has a fairly smooth progression curve, groupable gear has had a lot less focus on it's progressive nature.</p>

<p>DoDh loot "revamp" was where a new "model" for group gear was introduced, whereby group gear was modelled against raid gear, this was a step in the right direction but it doesn't seem to be working in quite the way it was intended.</p>

<p>Before the next expansion is here we will have high end raiders in unauged gear of 425+ hp/mana<br />
& high end groupers in unauged gear of 225+ hp/mana, for group content to be tuned with that kind of gap in mind in uninstanced content is just not workable, so SoE are effectively putting raiders into a "Raiders only raid" box, & groupers in a "groupers only group" box, for a grouper to step up into a high end raiding guild then becomes a case of that raid guild having to gear up a comparitively very weakly geared player in older, less used content, to give that weaker player more current gear.</p>

<p>Raiding is a huge part of everquest & one of it's best developed playstyles, eq raiding is one of the games greatest strengths, to make it such a huge jump to move from grouping to raiding is detrimental to the game.</p>

<p>While I agree with you loral SOE will never fix the gap. Why? They care about protecting the dozens of zones and raids worth of equipment that will be useless if you finally do fix this gap.<br />

<p>I agree that the TSS group armor lacks progression there should have been another level to the group armor to bump it up to around the 300 HP/Mana mark. I get the feeling that this armor should have had an extra Aug slot that somehow got lost. In their current for Teir 1 is barely an upgrade to DON cultural.</p>

<p>If on powering up to teir 2, it opened an Aug slot say Slot 15. Then Tenish could offer a group quest in Ashengate or Valdhome to obtain the specific Aug. Each slot should have a different quest so not everyone is fighting over a specific spawn.</p>

<p>Also by creating more than 1 or 2 levels in progression it keeps players in these zones longer. I have seen people get their teir 2 and then go back to doing Dain 1 for AA's. Not sure why, bores the hell outa me, but people do it.</p>

<p>I am also curious as to the respective power levels of the raid mobs in Sunderock/ Direwind/ Icefall and Valdehome. Mobs, like Fiddleback, Oblivion and Avalanche. Some of these should have been targeted at lower power guilds but not having tried any of them, I am unsure where they sit in the raid progression scheme.</p>

<p>Actually, closing the gap doesn't have to mean making old zones useless. The gap can just as easily be closed by removing the NO TRADE flag on raid gear from content 3 years old and older. That would leave plenty o'incentive to keep going back to the old content.</p>

<p>Plus, it has the ease of implementation angle going for it, in that no new content would actually need to be designed. :)</p>

<p>Removing the "No Trade" would just mean I would be forced to buy upgrades in the Bazaar at inflated prices and raiders could then go farm the stuff to sell in the bazaar when they are not actually raiding. Yes, it would close the gap but it would kill a lot of the enjoyment I get out of the game.</p>

<p>The equipment gap, the gap between becoming a raider for non-raiders, the lock out issue of zones.  All of that goes away in a three part process.</p>

<p>1) Remove the no-drop flag from any item that is not 100% needed to be no-drop for quest reasons (epic's and maybe a limited handfull of others), from any expansion more than 18 months old.</p>

<p>2) Remove the flag process for any zone entry that is more than 18 months old.  Leave the flags as optional for those that can/want to persue them for the end result rewards (AA's, etc.).</p>

<p>3) Add a tribute value to EVERYTHING, no exceptions.</p>

<p>The net result is yeah, there will be some people trying to fleece the bazaar market for the first three weeks.</p>

<p>After that, the abundance of what used to be raid only drops, a lot of which rot as they are of no value what so ever to the people currently able to get to them, will drive prices into the dirt.  Add to this the effect of newly equiped players able to now go into what are for the most part abandoned zones to exp (not raid), and to gain drops.  All fuelling the influx of older "raid" gear into the market.</p>

<p>Net effects:</p>

<p>1) Raiders will have a use for ALL otherwise useless drops.<br />
2) Non-raiders will be able to gear up (to 18 month old gear)<br />
3) Non-raiders with better gear will be able to group in areas they would have been slaughtered in had they been able to get the 72 people together to get into to unlock before hand.<br />
4) Whole segements of the game currently abandoned by raiders will become group exp zones.<br />
5) New "raiders" will be born from the now better equiped non-raider player pool.  Fueling the ability for the high end game to continue to grow, allowing for new blood, new guilds, and better competition.</p>

<p>Keep item #5 in mind.  It's the most important end result.  Keep it in mind when you ask yourself why your old guild died for lack of members, keep it in mind when you ask yourself what it would take for a new player to go from raw newb, to raider, keep it in mind when you consider the daunting task all too many high end guilds have in finding replacements for retired players (other than ebay hacks, or bots).</p>

<p>Total time needed by SOE, maybe 20 hours on the part of the itemization DBA to mass change the no-drop flag.  Some 10 hours to remove zone flag requirements by a programmer.  Add in some 10 more hours for the item changes to be reviewed by the quest developer to check for any major mistakes.</p>

<p>Net result, the issue is as dead as the hooker found in Absor's trunk in about 40 man hours.</p>

<p>Outstanding post by SomeoneThat AbsorHates. Very well thought out and offers alot of suggestions that are excellent IMO. Well done.  </p>

<p>What I don't get at all are the 2 posts above it:</p>

Excuse me , but how exactly does someone FORCE you to do anything in a pretend world ? You may CHOOSE to buy upgrades in the bazaar, but noone is going to force you.</p>

<p>Armarant said -->I agree 100 percent I get joy out of knowing that I can attain gear on my own without the need for the bazaar I dont want to be dependent on the bazaar in order to enjoy EQ.</p>

<p>I don't see how the proposed changes will keep you from attaining gear on your own. The gear will still be right there on the mobs like it always was. Again, you may CHOOSE to play EQ in the bazaar, but noone is going to FORCE you to shop there.<br />

<p>Instead of saying "removing the NO TRADE tag" I would amend it to "changing NO TRADE tag to ATTUNEABLE".  I don't think you'll get anywhere by simply removing the NO TRADE tag.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;naladini&#64;stormhammer&#46;org">Naladini</a> on November 21, 2006 12:28 PM</strong></p>
<p>Once again, this is about older raid gear, not the current stuff, so there's still plenty of seperation between current raiders and groupers.</p>

<p>Making old raid gear tradeable is a pretty easy change to make, doesn't impact the fact that monsters still need to be killed for the items to enter the game, and will help quickly close the gap between groupers and raiders.</p>

<p>Moving forward, subsequent expansions can be created with a smaller difference between raid/group gear, and the move against the No Trade flag could potentially be avoided for future expansions if a more consistent ratio can be maintained.</p>

<p><br />
From what I understand, Attunable would actually be a lot more work, in that for an Item to be attunable, there actually needs to be 2 copies of each item in the db, a tradeable and untradeable version. Add to that, difficulty in handling existing versions of items, which would probably wind up as a 3rd set. It also represents a much more gradual shift in closing the gear gap.</p>

<p>I'll grant removing the no drop tag from older raid gear has some advantages. It really would reduce the gear gap, and by tying the gap to the pace of raid progression (something SOE is good at controlling) it makes sure the gap stays reduced. It's easy to do. And giving raiders a new source of income reduces their opposition. But we should carefully consider what else it would do to the game.</p>

<p>A lot depends on the supply of raid items for sale, and that depends on how much time raiders would choose to spend raiding for cash. A raider can answer that better than I can, but in order to actually reduce the gap their has to be enough raid gear for sale that most non-raiders will be able to get a good bit of it. So let's assume that's the case.</p>

<p>Given that:</p>

<p>1) Almost all current single group gear immediately becomes obsolete. It's simply blown away by what can be bought in the bazaar.</p>

<p>2) Thus the progression path for non-raiders becomes "accumulate cash to buy raid gear in the bazaar."</p>

<p>3) At the same time, anything non-raiders can get or make just lost most of its value to other players. Thus cash drops and vendor trash become the primary objectives for single groups.</p>

<p>It's true that no one's forced to buy gear in the bazaar. Nor is one forced to level up, gain AA's, etc. Progression is the basis for the game, so if the best progression path makes for poor gameplay, that's a problem. Even if it's only the best progression path for non-raiders.</p>

<p>I would hope that the problems inherent in making the accumulation of cash the one and only requirement for non-raider progression are self evident (and this post is long enough without describing them). But let me add a couple of notes on non-raider psychology, in the spirit of "speaking for myself but strongly suspecting others feel the same way."</p>

<p>One problem is that I've often felt that the single group game is not respected, by raiders or the devs. Making single group progression consist of accumulating the crumbs from the raiders' table only increases that feeling.</p>

<p>Another is simply that wresting your gear from the cold dead hands of the mob you just killed is far more satisfying than buying it in the bazaar. Making money and spending it wisely has a place in the game, but it shouldn't be the entire game. Removing the no drop tag from raid gear would do exactly that.</p>

<p>Dear Krylax,</p>

<p>Of course no-one is forced to buy in the Bazaar. But as this is a discussion about closing the GAP it is relevent. As a group geared player I am unable to take down old raid mobs so how does the GAP close by making their drops tradable if I don't buy them in the bazaar. It doesn't. So again making those items tradable is useless to me. It forces me to buy them, if I choose to close the gap. What I and a lot of other people want is a way to close the gap within a group environment.</p>

<p>We want to be able to progress, not have stuff just handed to us.</p>

<p>Well said Teremar and Sunshadow. Every expansion they create group items that don't close the gap. If they ever wanted the gap closed they would have done so already. </p>

<p>Sunshadow,</p>

<p>Thanks for the second post. I can see that changing the no - drop flag wouldn't help you in your situation. Myself, I always liked wheeling and dealing in the bazaar, using my alchemy skill to make pp, etc. It added another dimension to the game for me. So buyable upgrades would help close the gear gap for me and the people I group with.</p>

<p>I don't want the gap closed. I want the gap narrowed.</p>

<p>Raid gear should always be better than single-group gear in the same expansions, or even up to three expansions back, but level 65 Tacvi gear shouldn't be better than the best single-group level 75 gear this far into the game.</p>

<p>Narrowing the gap would help the game out a lot.</p>

I agree with this completely. When i said "close" the gear gap I should have said "narrow".</p>

<p>One more thing I'd like to say (it's off topic - sorry).<br />
I posted a complaint a couple of articles ago about my inability to get my 69 and 70 spells and the trouble I had doing my job without them. From what I've read over at the shammy's crucible the TSS spell system is great and would help solve my problem. Kudos to the folks at EQ for making this change.</p>

<p>I think I would put the gear from the hardest, best designed, complex group missions & tasks as closer to Anguish level, it all comes down to risk versus reward, I would rather repeatedly try a difficult group task with 5 motivated people to gain a powerful gear item, than spend weeks camping parts in an  annoying & boring time-sink.</p>

<p>It boils down to having group tasks of a comparable level of difficulty & complexity to the equivalently powered raid, I don't see why some groupable, progressional tasks cannot reward players with gear that is closer in power to raid gear, it's down to time invested in the group game that matches raid development.</p>

<p>I certainly dont want to see where groupers are walking around in very high end gear that they got without so much as breathing hard, I want to see groupers in powerful gear that they had to use guile, ingenuity, planning & a lot of hard work to attain, reason being is the one thing missing from groups is a real sense of achievement.<br />

<p>I have come to point i believe where I can no longer play and enjoy this game. I dont have the time to raid so I'm screwed. I'm in a small family guild, Screwed. I play a Melee and if group not on i sit LFG for 3+hours, Screwed. </p>

<p>I thought the push to 75 was good for the game but after getting there I now believe otherwise. I cant solo or Duo anything that would produce a decent drop for me. And now im too high to get decent XP in the older zones i can now solo. It was a good 6+ year run and i had fun but its a raiders game now.</p>

<p>I agree the gap is huge now, but I think you overstate what is required to get the TSS armor, and I don't think it should be easier to get, as many of the camps are trivial (ie light blue trash) at 75.  The power sources drop almost every time you kill a named in Vald for example, and both together require a similar overall effort as past armor quests.</p>

<p>What surprised me most when I returned was that my gear was still pretty good, even after two years of not playing.  Very little of what drops is a big upgrade for me which was surprising.  </p>

<p>I think for most classes, gear matters very little in reality, less than you figure at least.  Any caster can have 15+ mana regen with bazaar trash and chances are if they get hit in good gear or bad gear in these zones they die.  My bots do fine with bazaar gear because they don't get hit.  Of course for tank classes, and even dps melee types, armor/weapons are pretty much what the class is based off of and this is where the gap can make or break a group.</p>

<p>I think it would have been a better idea to make it so any named over a certain level can drop the smaller molds, and then same for the bp/leg molds.  Then just as you level regardless of where you are, you have the chance to acquire them.  An AC upgrade where needed (for example the TSS warrior quest armor has less AC than elemental), changing req level to make sense (66+)and small 20ish hp/mana upgrades would make this armor perfect and superior to what I wear from years ago.</p>

<p>It's interesting to look back at itemization, particularly Kunark.  There was a huge gap before Kunark came out, between those who raided the planes to those who didn't.  When Kunark was released, items better than what we had were dropping from places like Karnors.  In effect we had to start over regearing, but we still had an advantage in that we were better equipped to get the new upgrades than anyone else.</p>

<p>The same was somewhat true in Velious where the Kunark armor was made obsolete by the quest armors, which anyone could get.  Raiders broadly had to re-equip with that armor, and other smaller things before moving into tov.  It hasn't been like that since, raiders in luclin and beyond, pretty much have gotten the real upgrades only on raids.  </p>

<p>They should really go back to that method, where the gap was there, about 30% as the end of an expansion neared, but then was severely lessened when a new expansion comes out.  In this way, raiders can get items in a new expansion that are as good as the previous raid items, and so can single groupers, but as raiders near the end of an expansions progression, they are wearing items 30%~ better than a grouper.  The raider almost always has an advantage because they come in with superior gear from the last expansion, allowing them to progress quicker (ie quicker exp, fighting harder named initially etc).</p>

<p>To get there from here the next expansion would need to have a large jump in the power of non raider gear, and a smaller jump in raider gear, so from the say 250~/500~ currently it'd go to like 375/550 in the next expansion, and then 475/600 in the following, and then basically following that trend, making a gap but keeping it more like 25-35%, most of which occurs at the start and end of expansions, with the middle time having the two groups be relatively close gear wise.<br />

<p>(quick reply: Raiders shouldn't fuel the gear for a server.  Players should be able to go out ON THEIR OWN (either 1 or 2 groups) to get their major upgrades.  Sure make a few soloable to make it a little easier.)</p>

<p>I think "The Gap" can't be discussed in terms of HP/MANA anymore.  (I don't know if it's just the terminology we use for this topic??)</p>

<p>There are really lots of subgroups for the itemization: weapons (ratio + proc), armor (AC + hp/mana, focus effects (melee + caster), stats.  I think partly what has exacerbated "The Gap" is upgrading part, but not all, of the subgroups.  Boosting the hp/mana of an item does NOT mean it's an upgrade unless the other effects are also present or compensated through another piece of gear.</p>

<p>Each class needs their set of gear: warriors need AC + mitigation mods, melee dps needs weapons with good ratios, and casters need foci for their spells; oversimplified but trying to be brief.</p>

<p>It gets very complicated with all the different focus effects we have.  Warriors don't just need AC and hp/mana anymore, they need the good stuff like shielding and a whole host of other effects.  </p>

<p>Looking for upgrades lately is frustrating because of balancing all of these stats with the choices given (loot).  We have seen a gradual increase of hp/mana on items but there is consistently a disconnect when including other foci.  Numerous threads come up with each expansion release questioning the itemization.  A few of the latest examples from the Veterans Lounge:</p>

<p>-TSS 70+ Single Group Weapons.  <br />
-Weapons in TSS So far  </p>

<p>-Teir 4 Helms: Warrior 90ac, Paladin 70ac, Chain 70ac Why?</p>

<p>-Lack of focuses on end game class only items<br />
-Focus affects after level 70 </p>
