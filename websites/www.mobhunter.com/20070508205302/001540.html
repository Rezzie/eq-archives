<h1 class="article_title">What Does a Yearly Expansion Cycle Mean for Everquest?</h1>
<p>by Loral on May 05, 2007</p>

<p>On 30 April 2007, Everquest's current producer, Clint Worley, announced that SOE would begin a yearly development cycle for Everquest expansions beginning this November and taking place every November thereafter. Today we discuss the possible impact of this large strategic change in Everquest's development.</p>

<p>During the original Everquest Community Summit SOE stated that predictable population drops occurred between expansions. The population would also predictably rise every time a new expansion was released. SOE argued that six-month development cycles helped keep the population more steady than the peaks and valleys seen in yearly expansions. Now SOE moves back to the yearly expansions, a release cycle we haven't seen since the release of Planes of Power.</p>

<p>This recent change brings up many more questions than answers. For example, what will this do to the development team itself? Will SOE reduce the amount of money spent over the year? Will the same number of developers remain on the staff throughout the year-long development cycle? How does this affect the developer's salaries? If it lowers the amount of money they earn, will they be more likely to find other projects?</p>

<p>What will this do to the product itself? Will the cost increase? Some players speculate that the cost will likely go up to $40 per expansion. A yearly release of the entire Everquest collection including all previous expansions and one new expansion could be another strategy. With the strength of competing MMO expansions such as Blizzard's Burning Crusade expansion for World of Warcraft, SOE may have a hard time selling an Everquest expansion for the same cost.</p>

<p>What will happen to the in-game population over the year? Will the lands of Norrath become barren during the summer months? Video and computer game releases often relax during the summer months, hoping to focus attention closer to the holidays. The number of people playing Zelda: Twilight Princess during the summer matters very little to the overall health of any single player's experiences, but a reduced population in an MMO affects each player who wishes to play - especially in a game with a very clear focus on group and raid encounters.</p>

<p>What caused SOE to make this radical change? The quality of expansions released in the spring has always lagged behind the quality of expansions released in the fall. What happened recently to make them decide that a yearly release was a better idea? Was it the clear lack of quality in spring releases or some other decision based on player metrics and business trends?</p>

<p>What will SOE do with those extra months? Will we see larger expansions like Omens of War, The Serpent's Spine, or even Planes of Power? Will SOE return to a multi-tiered model where even high-end raiders need to progress through multiple sets of end-zones in order to complete all of the raids in a single expansion? Will SOE use the time to debug, tune, balance, and polish the release? We can certainly hope.</p>

<p>Why would SOE tell us this now? Perhaps they tell us to help quiet the voices that complain about the current twice-yearly release cycle or perhaps they are setting us up for future changes yet unheard.</p>

<p>It will be nearly nineteen months before we see the true result of this change. The November release this year gives SOE two more months to improve this fall's expansion but we won't see the full result of a yearly development cycle until fall 2008. That's a long way off and a lot can happen. With the recent release of Lord of the Rings Online and the upcoming Age of Conan, the competition for massive multiplayer online role playing games gets thick. Blizzard will no doubt release another expansion for World of Warcraft in that time. Rumors speak to a new Blizzard MMO release as well, possibly announced in May. This is also the first full year with consoles being able to fully support massive online games without any hardware modifications or additions. What will the population in Everquest be like when the MMO universe has many alternate worlds to explore and half a year before Norrath sees changes to its landscape?</p>

<p>The console market is ready for a good powerful console-based massive online game. All of these things may drastically change the landscape between now and the first full-year expansion release for Everquest since Planes of Power.</p>

<p>We will end this discussion with a few predictions and a few things to monitor over the next year.</p>

<p>First, I predict the next expansion will be a large one with a level increase, possibly even to 85, and multiple tiers of single-group and raid progression. The expansion will have to include a large amount of progressive encounters and rewards to keep people playing throughout most of 2008. It may also include a large amount of solo content, and may need to if the populations do begin to lower over the summer of 2008. I hope we begin seeing more regular releases of new player models. SOE cannot include new models in an expansion if they plan to change them for everyone, but it is clearly the most outdated feature of Everquest right now. Overall, I expect this year's expansion to be a big one, on the order of Omens of War, The Serpent's Spine, and maybe even Planes of Power.</p>

<p>Over the next year we should continue to watch the population of Everquest. I expect we may see a server merger in the spring of 2008 to off-set the reduced amounts of players over the summer. We should also keep an eye on the development staff itself. If we start to see some of the bigger names moving on to newer projects, that could bode poorly for the game overall. Eventually Everquest will make that transition from a fully developed and marketed product to one of maintenance and upkeep. This next year may be the time we see this switch.</p>

<p>At this time we have far more questions than answers. We can keep our fingers on the silk strands of our web, feeling for the vibrations that will tell us more of what may come to pass, but for now, the web remains still.</p>

<p>I think you sum-up quite well the concerns of many regarding this change.</p>

<p>I think your prediction of a level raise may be right, although previously level raises were each 2 years, SoE may see level raises yearly as an important part of their new strategy.</p>

<p>I think we'll likely see a raise to 80, 85 is possible but I think it's unlikely, but I think both will be a bit harder to attain than in prior expansions.</p>

<p>I also think there will be a need for a large AA pool the next expansion, AA are seen as a major "something to do to stop me getting bored", & I also think we muight see more expendables.</p>

<p>We might see a further tier of cultural armor introduced, though the ac on the type 12 AAAA created augments will not advance past the current last blood as they were too high ac.</p>

<p>As for dev staff, I sincerely hope the change does not mean a downsizing, as I think it will be impossible to meet the goals & aspirations the devs currently have with less people.</p>

<p>Probably a good move in the long run because the expansions will be more polished when they come out, but being stuck with TBS as the top expansion until November makes me queasy.  The expansion has very little reward for Anguish-Demiplane guilds like ours:  the orux weapons and armor aren't upgrades and we can't survive Solteris, so all we can get are spells and the skeletal hand augment.</p>

<p>I think they should put an orux augment vendor into Katta who sells upgraded DoN style augments.  Level 75 focus effects, Life Sap III, maybe some very expensive ones that have combined effects.  If orux won't work because there's too much of it floating around, create a fifth currency.</p>

<p>I think its all just a guise from SOE in order to hide their real plan which is to take over Vangard: Saga of Heroes since it would be cheaper for them to take over another game that is similar to EQ and make it thier own instead of rebuilding a whole new game from scracth or trying to rebuild EQ.</p>

<p>My assumptions comes from Brad McQuad's recent post that was originally on VNboards and has been copied to the Silkyvenoms board of SOH.  McQuad pretty much says that Vangard is working on a deal (plan to sell most of its game right) with SOE in exchange for a financial bail out.</p>

<p>You can read the McQuad comments here:</p>

<p>*************************************************<br />
SOE is in discussions with Sigil regarding the future of Vanguard and Sigil Games in Carlsbad. Talks are going well and first and foremost, our primary concern right now is what's best for Vanguard and its community. We want to ensure that this game and its community have a healthy future. The specifics that we work out over the coming days will all be with that single goal in mind.</p>

<p>What does that mean? It means that right now Vanguard is doing decently but not as well as we hoped. If you havent read my last long post that outlined some of the things that went wrong during development, etc., please do. So the bottom line is that SOE is going to be getting more involved with Sigil and Vanguard our relationship is going to become even tighter much tighter. At this point I cant say much more than that.</p>

<p>Does this mean an acquisition? I cant say at this point.</p>

<p>Does this mean more or less people at Sigil? I cant say at this point.</p>

<p>Does this mean management changes at Sigil? I cant say at this point.</p>

<p>I *can* say that regardless of the turn out, SOE knows that Sigil has the experience and vision necessary to run Vanguard and therefore a major change in that area is extremely unlikely and would be foolish on their part.</p>

<p>What it does mean at this point is that both companies agree that we need more of SOEs involvement if Vanguard is going to continue to get the support it needs to both continue to be worked on and improved and debugged and optimized. When people start getting burned out of the Warcraft expansion (pardon the pun), we need to make sure that the game is more polished and will play on lower end machines. As people continue to level up, it means that we need additional higher level content, including raid content. If we are going to change our marketing message effectively to target those who played a lot of EverQuest but who have grown up such that they have jobs, families, etc. that they cannot and will not play another EverQuest even though they enjoyed they game years ago. Weve done studies and its not atypical of an old EQ player, when they hear about Vanguard, to assume that because many of the people involved in Vanguards development worked on EQ as well, that Vanguard must simply be an EQ 3. From that point they dont even give Vanguard another look. They dont do any more research on the game. They dont go to the official sites. They dont go to the affiliate sites. Instead they think to themselves, ah well, were I younger and had my life not changed, Id give it a shot, but I just dont have the time for another EQ with better graphics right now.<br />
And thats it they dont give Vanguard another thought EQ peaked in late 2001 at almost 500k subscribers. In its lifetime its sold over 2 million units. Putting EQ in a vacuum and thats a lot of people who played and who arent playing anymore. And the total number of subscribers didnt start going down until sometime 2002. Im also pretty sure up until its peak that the average lifespan of a player was nearing 9-23 months. And as I mentioned in my last lengthy post, this group of people who played but dont anymore could arguably be put into two sub-groups those who look back fondly at those months and even years and those who dont. I have read posts and received emails from people who claim to have played to max level and then quit very angry the I just played your game for 2 years and now I hate you emails. But realistically how big is that group? Even if it was half (boggle) the other group is still pretty big. So ignoring all of the people who have quit or who are growing bored of their current MMOG (WoW, FFXI, DAoC, etc) that need to be reached (and in a very different way, especially the WoW player), both a word of mouth and a formal marketing campaign targeting these people clearly needs to launched. These people need to know that Vanguard does have the EQ feel in many ways but that it is much more soloable than EQ was, especially the early EQ days. They need to know that you can play for short periods of time and advance. They need to know that the end game is not all about raiding into the wee hours of the night. Some subset of these people will still feel burnt out of MMOGs period, but I think theres a lot of people who havent been reached and our and others research supports that. False assumptions are being made by a lot of people. The reality is that Vanguard *is* the game most of these people are looking for it has the good they remember, but has eliminated a lot of the tedium and necessary long hours that dont fit into their lifestyle anymore.</p>

<p>Then there are the people who are growing weary of their current MMOG. Given how much larger the MMOG gamespace has grown since EQs zenith in 2001 (arguably 7 times as large worldwide, and at least 2-3 time as large in North America alone), we have to take advantage of this. At some point these people are going to want to start a new MMOG (especially after the WoW expansion newness has worn out, which for most of the non-hard-core would be when you really have to start raiding in the expansion). LoTR Online is an x-factor reviews from beta testers seem to indicate that the game is more casual like WoW, a small game, and that it looks really good but can run on a lower end system much better than Vanguard (just as WoW can). So at least for a time the more casual bored WoW player may migrate to LoTR Online. How sticky (e.g. how long that game will hold onto players) is unknown, but I think its safe to say that a significant percentage of the more casual bored WoW player will head to LoTR at least first, given the franchise around it. Conservatively this leaves the more hard core WoW player (which in Vanguard or EQ terms would be considered either a hard core or, more likely, a core gamer). That number, even just taking the North American and European gamer is still potentially a large one and needs to be targeted (given Vanguards high system specs, the time it will take to localize, and Blizzards name recognition and pre-existing proven marketing ability in Asia, I wouldnt count that group, although a very significant one, until 2008 or so. Targeting that group is for a future discussion).<br />
Lastly, theres the very real issue of Vanguards system specs, even for the core and hard core gamer in North America and Europe. For a variety of reasons and mistakes on our part that I wont get into right now, Vanguard was released with system spec requirements that were too high for January 2007. Continued optimization will help to a degree, but the games big hope here is simply Moores Law and that by the second half of 2007, and certainly by the end of the year, the system spec issue will have been greatly diminished. The big problem that remains is that you still pretty much need a new system as opposed to, say, simply a new graphics card. But eventually, gamers do replace their systems. Given what Vista (especially the Ultimate edition) takes to really run, combined with other games that come out by the end of the year that really push technology, many people will be compelled to buy new systems. Unlike EQ, which was one of the first hardware only games, Vanguard needs not only a fast graphics card, but also a system with pci-express, fast memory, a fast FSB, etc. With EQ, you just needed to buy a Voodoo 1 or Voodoo 2 the rest of your system is fine. With Vanguard, however, just plugging the fastest AGP card into your 2-3 year old system doesnt cut it. In fact, Vanguard runs pretty well on a 2 GB system with a decent pci-express video card and fast memory in a 2.6 GHz Pentium; conversely, run the game on an older AGP system, the fastest AGP card you can buy, and a 3.2 GHz CPU and youll have framerate issues. The game is simply not CPU bound, nor just graphics card bound, but rather mostly bound by the data that it needs to constantly move from the CPU to main memory to the graphics card, and then all the way back again. Its all about the various bus speeds and caches moving data around efficiently is arguably more important than processing that data on the CPU or GPU. The only fix here, again, is time. Vista (especially the Ultimate edition, which is whats being pushed to gamers) wants fast components. Direct X 10 hardware and software will help a lot, especially when there is a DX10 version of Vanguard. A native 64bit client of Vanguard will eventually help a lot too. Bottom line: by the end of 2007, a lot more people should have upgraded, especially if Microsoft succeeds with Vista and native DX 10 games. And if they really push Gaming for Windows like they did, say, the Xbox 360, the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008 should be a very different landscape for PC games in general and Vanguard specifically. Was the Vanguard tech ahead of its time? Yes, and there has been a price to pay for that short term. But MMOGs ideally never end and if youve architected your engine to both push the limits of existing and near future technology as well as easily employ future technologies, then you have a game that doesnt look dated one, two, even three plus years down the road. And thats what we did with Vanguard so we feel some pain now, but if we can keep the momentum going, this decision pays off in the long run (big time).</p>

<p>In summary, there are arguably a lot of people who by mid to end of this year in the MMOG gamespace for whom Vanguard could potentially be very attractive. What the game needs is a re-launch of sorts, including targeted marketing campaigns, an all-around successful move by gamers to the next generation of hardware, continued good word of mouth viral marketing by those who are already playing, enjoying, and re-subscribing. And all of this could and should ramp up by the end of the year, all the while the Vanguard team is putting in more content, the live team filling out high level content as well as adding to areas of the games vast seamless world which are a bit empty. Then a re-launch towards the end of the year that includes the first expansion, one that would add RTS style city building, ship to ship combat, jousting, and a second half of the Kojanese Archipelago that makes ship travel meaningful and by meaningful I mean not tedious, rewarding exploration, with lots of new areas (both in the existing world and in the extension of the archipelago). And Im talking about some re-use of existing art, combined with new art that fits into the existing continents, and then finally some all out new stuff different styles of terrain (islands) and ocean to look at while making your journey to found a new player city while constantly being attacked by exotic sea creatures, leviathans, and other traditional members of fantasy and crypto-zoology. Not to mention pirates with canons, or other players and their ships on the PvP servers. And who knows, could be first expansion or second, but eventually you need to pull from Mesoamerican mythology, encounter empires based on Greco-roman architecture... it goes on and on, its all planned out, and Vanguard can do all of it given sufficient time. The tools have matured, both in terms of art and design, and the art process orders of magnitude more efficient because of years of Maya scripting, an in-house terrain generator that creates what you want as opposed to spitting out algorithmically generated hills and valleys, and an art team that has this process down pat for example, they were able to re-create Tursh and Leth Nurae in a fraction of time it took them to create the original, smaller, and much less interesting versions.</p>

<p>SOE is in discussions with Sigil regarding the future of Vanguard and Sigil Games in Carlsbad. Talks are going well and first and foremost, our primary concern right now is what's best for Vanguard and its community. We want to ensure that this game and its community have a healthy future. The specifics that we work out over the coming days will all be with that single goal in mind.</p>

<p>So what does that mean again? Again, I apologize for not being able to go into details and its the details that need to be worked out. But I think its safe to say that both Sigil and SOE see the potential of a mind blowing game by the end of the year. Whats needed, bottom line, is some time, and how to get that time is whats being worked out. And so I still see a 500k+ game, I was just off by a year for a variety of reasons, some under my control, many not. And I think SOE sees this as well. To pull it off however, requires a funded and supported Sigil and a well marketed Vanguard with these different target audiences identified and solid plan on how to reach them all, and then a solid execution of said plan, hitting them hard, pushing these WoW everywhere point of purchase materials from the front to the very back.. In the meantime, the Vanguard that was launched in early 2007 continues to move forward, with much of what Ive talked about patched in over time, and the rest in the first expansion (or re-launch, or whatever we all agree upon in terms of product and service placement). Bottom line, Vanguard continues to march forward, a solid and fun game today, and an even better one tomorrow. More state of the game posts by me, a regularly updated In the Works . And whatever kind of increased partnership between Sigil and SOE is necessary to make this vision a reality. And again, as for what that means exactly, more on that later . </p>

<p>This is where I believe all the SOE resources are going to right now....to bail out Vangard.  SOE is not taking more time on this next expansion to fix some old bugs, provide us with better content, or a cleaner game.  This is just what they want us to believe. </p>

<p>IMO, the bottome line is that SOE is looking at taking control or Vanguard and can't resource EQ1, EQ2, SWG or any of there other games in the short term if they do.  Vanguard is going down fast, really fast so they are selling themselves to the DEVIL (SOE) and SOE to keep the game a float and hopefully their careers.  </p>

<p>Again, IMO, SOE see's this as its best way and the quickest way to get back at WOW and is all over this deal but SOE will have to pull and reallocate resources to make it work.  The turnaround time for Vangaurd is short lived so SOE/Sigil need to hurry.</p>

<p>I not normally a conspiracy theorist but this is just too coincidental. I don't trust SOE and never will play another of their games hosted or developed.  I'd rather go without than get back into another SOE system.</p>

<p>This post was NOT made by the real Aarkan, Loral. I don't know what it said but I am the #1 guy to not spoil stuff especially not the movie of the year.</p>

<p>On topic, I'm really hoping they can add ways for new or returning players to catch up reasonably to the people with very high gear and hundreds of AA's. I've tried getting back into EQ many times though I always give up when I notice there is absolutely nobody in my level range that wants to group or do anything fun and that it will take me unreasonable amounts of time to catch up to everyone even a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Sunshadow on May  7, 2007 02:34 AM</strong></p>
<p>For a game in EQ lifecycle they absolutely need to make it easy to get into the game and easy to get to a reasonable level.</p>

<p>Firstly they need to release all future expansions so that they include the full game up to that point. Similar to the annerversary edition. That fact it included TBS was fantastic.</p>

<p>Secondly the road to at least lvl 60 has to be made faster. This can be achieved by uping the ZEMs on lower lvl zones. They also need to be able to purchase/unlock blocks of lower AA's as with over 1000 they are more daunting then levels at this stage.</p>

<p>Sadly, I think the most likely reason for the change is that SOE has lost money--or at least not gotten the return on investment they wanted--on the last couple expansions. Otherwise they'd keep doing what they have been doing. And if that's the case, then making one expansion a year that's<br />
twice as big (and thus twice as expensive to develop) and charging twice as much for it doesn't change much. SOE needs to change the ratio of revenue to costs.</p>

<p>One change is that players may be less likely to skip the only expansion of the year. That would help the revenue side. I've seen some anecdotal evidence that more people aren't buying all the expansions--does that match others' experience?</p>

<p>But it's more likely that SOE is looking to cut costs. I suspect they plan to reduce the total amount of EQ content they produce per year, and recognized that splitting what they do produce into two expansions would make them even easier to skip--especially since they can't lower the price proportionally (or they'd just keep losing money).</p>

<p>I don't say this to criticize SOE. They're in the business to make money, and the harsh reality is that fewer subscribers means a smaller market for expansions means less money coming in means less money for producing content.</p>

<p>This also changes the purpose of expansions. In the past they've been a major profit source. Now I suspect the focus switches from selling expansions to maintaining player interest so they keep subscribing. It's a subtle change, but it will be interesting to see how it plays out. SOE may even be willing to lose some money on expansions to keep people playing. That could be a good thing for players.</p>

<p>SOE also has to make a strategic decision: with reduced resources it's going to be much harder to keep ahead of the hard-core raiders who already burn through content at a frightening pace. On the other hand, they're EQ's most loyal customers and that part of the game is EQ's biggest strength. Thus I wouldn't be too surprised if we see an even greater focus on high end raids. I don't think it's too unreasonable to assume that other players probably haven't done a lot of the existing content. More AAs are definitely a good idea for them, and a level cap increase may help them be able to do more content--though that also trivializes some of the content they're supposed to do. Itemization revamps to make older zones more attractive might be a cheap way to keep people interested in playing them rather than clamoring for new zones--maybe that's something they could do in between expansions.</p>

<p>Everyone should also expect to spend more time in any given content, as SOE has to make it last a year. Lower drop rates, longer grinds, etc.</p>

<p>Now this does coincide with with Brad McQuaid apparently wanting to see more resources for Vanguard, but they're really separate issues. If keeping the EQ dev staff the same size made economic sense and if increasing the size of the Vanguard dev staff also made economic sense, then SOE could easily do both (either directly by acquiring Sigil or by sending them more money). I'm not sure either is the case.</p>

<p>Vanguard was developed and marketed as the "hardcore" MMORPG, with long travel times, annoying corpse runs, etc. The target audience was always different than WoW's. Never having played it I couldn't say why that hasn't worked out. Perhaps the number of people who put up with that when EQ was the only thing going turned out to be a poor predictor of how many people wanted it given a choice. Perhaps WoW's high-end raid game has turned out to be more satisfying for hardcore players than expected. Or perhaps Vanguard simply failed to execute? I don't know. I have to admit I was amused by the bit on travel though. In development they always said travel would be time-consuming, but that it would also be "meaningful" and fun. Apparently they got the time-consuming part, but the meaningful and fun part will be in the next expansion...</p>

<p>I'm dubious about Vanguard suddenly changing its focus to attract more players. But if they decide to do it, I'd say new blood is needed. The name Brad McQuaid has too many negative associations. Besides, we know what his preferences are in an MMORPG. He may be willing to change Vanguard to make it commercially viable, but who wants to play a game whose devs don't like it?</p>

<p>>> then making one expansion a year that's twice as big (and thus twice as expensive to develop) </p>

<p>I don't think an expansion that's twice as big is twice as expensive to develop.  Costs are not linear like that.  The cost of box art, printing CDs and whatever marketing they do (just to name a few) wouldn't change.  </p>

<p>Other costs, in terms of lore and zone art(for example) would be more, but not twice as much.  Maybe 30-50% more.  Plus, they could do certain things to improve efficiency.  Such as taking an existing zone and make 5 different instanced missions in it, which would be no more art work though a bit more developemnt time.  They don't need to make twice the number of character models.  Maybe a couple extra, but not double.</p>

<p>So while I agree it will cost more, it certainly wouldn't double.</p>

<p>As for the Vanguard stuff, very strong rumors have been around for a couple weeks.  With the population closer to the Matrix than EQ and EQ2 combined, it's the only hope for that game to survive.  </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Keisa on May  7, 2007 02:05 PM</strong></p>
<p>I recently started playing Vanguard a fair bit.  Here are my viewpoints:</p>

<p>Vanguard's biggest problem, without a doubt, is that it requires a high end system to play.  If you have a 2-3 year old computer like I do, then it is a mediocre experience.  I even have a very nice video card, and when I go to one of the major cities my computer chokes.  I can barely take a step every 2-3 seconds, and turning to go through a door while moving is a catastrophy waiting to happen.  Vanguard's response to this issue is that people will have to have better computers to run Vista, so by the end of the year most people will be able to run VG fine, what we call in the industry Overcome By Events (OBE).  Really, now.</p>

<p>Vanguard is supposed to be like the original EQ1, but when I play it, I feel more like I'm playing WOW.  Everyone can solo well past where I am in the game.  It might take a hell of a lot longer than WOW, but there are an overabundance of quests that take anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours to do that can be solo'd.  The only way that I see that it is like EQ1 is that there are more timesinks in this game than any game I have ever played.  Everything is measured to take a certain amount of time to do, and everything takes lots of time.  It is divided into smaller, more digestible bites, but the game itself is one long grind, be you adventuring, tradeskilling, harvesting, or doing diplomacy.  If you like grinding, then this is the game for you.</p>

<p>I have done tradeskills in almost every MMO I have ever played, and VG tradeskills has to be the most tedious, boring system ever.  The system is somewhat similar to EQ2, except where EQ2 is dynamic and interactive, VG's is menu driven.  When I say menu driven, I mean that you perform an action, get results, then choose another action.  This is the first game I've played where I just flat out decided I won't do tradeskills because it was not enjoyable.</p>

<p>Diplomacy introduced a new and interesting way to play the game.  Basically, you play a card game where your cards determine your skills at diplomacy.  Using your cards (diplomatic skills), you sweet talk, cajole, or threaten your opponent into coming around to your point of view.  My one complaint is that since the decks are static for all the NPCs and randomness has little to no affect on the game, and you have to win a gagillion games to build skill and win quests.  This means playing the same game over and over with little to no variation.  I think it is a good start, but all NPCs should randomly choose cards so that games are interesting instead of being highly repetative.  If I have to beat the same three NPCs 100 times to go on to the next set of NPCs, then those NPCs should not always play the exact same way.  I really like diplomacy, but don't know if I'm going to be able to stand the grinding aspect.</p>

<p>So, that's my view of VG.</p>

Not sure how this became a Vanguard article, with all the replies as such.  Thought we were talking about the 1-year expansion cycle for EQ.</p>

<p>Anyway, with regards to diplomacy in Vanguard, the Vanguard devs have stated that the AI is not really that great right now, which is why the NPCs have an extra card than they should based on their skill.  That's something they were working on, and when the AI is improved, the extra card will go.</p>

<p>I know what you mean about playing the same game over and over.  I found a couple NPCs in Tursh (two of which have since been removes) where I could go and play over and over and over, using the same deck and beat them about 95% of the time (lost once in a while when I wasn't paying attention.)</p>

<p>So, how about that 1 year expansion cycle for EQ. . . . .<br />

<p>1 Year expansion timelines.</p>

<p>First I think it's important that people keep in mind, that the "next" expansion is due out in November.  What ever the content, etc., it's not part of the 1 year cycle.</p>

<p>That said, a jaundiced eye should be used in reading everything in the latest producers letter.  In a nutshell, nothing that was said was new.  Pretty much the same verbage was used by Brenlo when addressing the community at large after the fiasco of Gates of Discord, and the first players summit.</p>

<p>The Everquest community sits now years later, with very few of the changes that where promised at the first summit made true.</p>

<p>Actually, the key point everyone should cling to is, the developers as a whole all said they had been given the controls to make sure that never again would an unfinished product be put out the door.</p>

<p>Yet, it seems, they where not being all that truthfull at the time.</p>

<p>If a prediction should be made at this early hour in the game of SOE public relations vs. the existing user base; it is this: What ever SOE says is no doubt something that they will claim later was never promised(tm).  That prediction is something you can take to the bank.</p>

<p>The whole Vangaurd thing just might be correct. Vangaurd is a great game, it just needs some minor tweaks. And I can see Sony recognizing that and wanting to take advantage of it by buying into it. Or just flat out buying it. We don't know for sure what the outcome will be as of yet since no one is talking. But that just might be part of the reason Sony is going with the yearly expansion cycle for Everquest.</p>

<p>I play Vangaurd, and I find it to be a very enjoyable game. Keisa made some very salient points however, and I'd like to respond to them.</p>

<p>++++++++++++<br />
Vanguard's biggest problem, without a doubt, is that it requires a high end system to play...<br />
++++++++++++</p>

<p><br />
Very true. I have a new (January) XPS 700 with an 8800 and 4 gig of ram. And I get stutter lag when first going into some chunks or cities (chunks are what Vangaurd calls zones, except the zone time is very fast, on the order of 3 seconds). But then again, I have my resolution set to 1920x1600 and almost everything maxxed out in the video options. Even so, the hardware requirements is a big problem right now.</p>

<p>++++++++++++<br />
Vanguard is supposed to be like the original EQ1, but when I play it, I feel more like I'm playing WOW...It might take a hell of a lot longer than WOW, but there are an overabundance of quests that take anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours to do that can be solo'd. The only way that I see that it is like EQ1 is that there are more timesinks in this game than any game I have ever played...It is divided into smaller, more digestible bites, but the game itself is one long grind, be you adventuring, tradeskilling, harvesting, or doing diplomacy.<br />
++++++++++++</p>

<p><br />
Vanguard does have a good number of quests, a good quest log that actually guides you on what your steps are for completing a quest, there are a good number of mobs available to beat on and they are populated in areas suitable for various level ranges. If that's like WoW, then that's fine by me and it's about time. And speaking of time, yeah, it takes a while to do things. So what?  What kind of enjoyment would you get from an MMO if you maxed your level in a week? As you yourself point out, at least it is portioned into small enough bits to get something done each night. THANK YOU for that Sigil. Yes, although it does take time, you can solo for quite a bit...until you hit the high 20s and 30s, where it slows down considerably for the soloer. Most quests at that level require a group to complete and the mobs get harder to solo too. But if you can't solo to your twenties in EQ1, you aren't hunting the right places.</p>

<p>Grinding, yep, there is a lot of grinding. However, most of it is for faction. You see, there are a lot of quests that you cannot get until you have a certain amount of faction. And many of these have outstanding armor or weapon rewards.</p>

<p>And yes, crafting is a grind as is diplomacy. But crafting has always been a grind, in my eyes. I will agree that the Diplomacy grind is a little much, but only a little.</p>

<p>++++++++++++<br />
I have done tradeskills in almost every MMO I have ever played, and VG tradeskills has to be the most tedious, boring system ever. The system is somewhat similar to EQ2, except where EQ2 is dynamic and interactive, VG's is menu driven. When I say menu driven, I mean that you perform an action, get results, then choose another action. This is the first game I've played where I just flat out decided I won't do tradeskills because it was not enjoyable.<br />
++++++++++++</p>

<p><br />
That is a valid interpretation. However, let me point out that the "menu" system (not really what you'd traditionally call menus, but close enough I suppose) allows for you to stop crafting at any point, go do something IRL that comes up, return, and be exactly where you were and continue.</p>

<p>Also, there ARE dynamics to crafting in Vangaurd, just not "real-time" dynamics as in EQ2. That is, you will definitely get complications that are random, to a certain extent, to which you will have to respond, a-la EQ2. It's just that you can take as much time as you want to select the response you want to make. And this is important due to the following...</p>

<p>The kicker with crafting in Vangaurd is it is entirely points-driven. No power, no endurance, just points. That is, each thing you do, from an action to advance the quality of the item, to an action that advances the progress, to all the response actions for complications, they all use up points from your fixed allotment for the recipe. So, crafting requires thought, at every point, as to whether to increase progress at the cost of quality, and vice-versa. PLUS, there are the random gods-forsaken complications. So, much more planning is required to come out with a high-quality item.</p>

<p>++++++++++++<br />
Diplomacy introduced a new and interesting way to play the game. Basically, you play a card game where your cards determine your skills at diplomacy. Using your cards (diplomatic skills), you sweet talk, cajole, or threaten your opponent into coming around to your point of view. My one complaint is that since the decks are static for all the NPCs and randomness has little to no affect on the game, and you have to win a gagillion games to build skill and win quests. This means playing the same game over and over with little to no variation. I think it is a good start, but all NPCs should randomly choose cards so that games are interesting instead of being highly repetative. If I have to beat the same three NPCs 100 times to go on to the next set of NPCs, then those NPCs should not always play the exact same way. I really like diplomacy, but don't know if I'm going to be able to stand the grinding aspect.<br />
++++++++++++</p>

<p>Yes, and no. As you restate, the cards ARE your diplomacy skills. But you don't have access to your entire deck in a parlay (the name for a diplomatic "fight"), you have to select a set of your cards to use beforehand. Which to choose? Well, there are some indicators on the NPC to help guide you as to the type of "combat" they favor, but that's all you get the first time you parlay with someone to determine what cards you want to pick. And altough all NPCs have access to the same decks, they don't all use the same cards in a parlay. Many NPCs will play their cards differently from others to a certain extent. And learning how a particular NPC uses their cards can take several parlays, even a dozen or so depending on the difficulty of the parlay. And let me tell you, they can be HARD. Depending on how much higher the NPC's diplomacy skill is than yours, the parlay can get to be extremely challenging or even impossible to win. So there is definitely challenge involved learning the different NPCs. However, yes, once you do learn an NPC it becomes a matter of choosing the same cards over and over and over...until you've beaten them as many times as you need for faction or diplomacy skillups or w/e.</p>

<p>Diplomacy is also how a vast portion of the game's lore is presented, and it's all fascinating. Sigil did a great job with the lore. All you lore-junkies will love it.</p>

<p><br />
Most of the big issues that I have with the game don't involve the game itself at all. Lag, crashing to desktop after chunking a few times, getting stuck in geometry, grouping issues like being dropped from group when chunking and some odd looting issues where noone in the group can loot an item because the game thinks another item is being rolled on even though there isn't. Those kind of things. Each alone isn't too bad, but some nights you get all of them and it can be annoying.</p>

<p>All in all I give Vangaurd a thumbs up, but they need to work on these things and make the game completely stable. If they do, it will be just as fun as Wow or anything out there, but with some challenge to it. Sony may see this and just may be planning to snap it up.</p>

<p>"I don't think an expansion that's twice as big is twice as expensive to develop...[various good points]"</p>

<p>It all depends on what you mean by "twice as big" (and I was rather vague about it). The things you describe, like adding a couple more models rather than doubling the number, or adding more missions to the same zones, are exactly what I expect them to do. I just wouldn't call the result "twice as big."</p>

<p>The bottom line is that I think we're going to see downsizing (though perhaps not until after the next expansion ships). How big an impact that has on the game experience will depend on how creative the devs can be about using the reduced resources. But the obvious things like reducing the number of unique models and reusing zones, are things players do notice and I, at least, don't like.</p>

<p>Hmm, after reading my post I see my point might be lost in all the Vangaurd talk, for which I apologise. My point was this: In my opinion Vanguard is a great game. It's like WoW but with much more challenge. Fun, beautiful artwork, entertaining, engaging and it doesn't go by too fast. It just needs some tweaking. Sony isn't stupid. They can see this.</p>

<p>After I read your previous article about whether Sony is abandoning EQ1, not a few days later rumors were floating around that Sony was buying Vangaurd. I was completely floored. I immediately thought about how disastrous this could be for EQ1 and it's diminishing subscriber numbers if it were true. Then Brad confirms that there actually IS talk going on.</p>

<p>Now comes news that Sony is moving to a yearly EQ1 expansion release cycle. And this makes my spider sense tingle (to tie into that odd Spiderman 3 post). Your ideas could be all there is Loral, but it could also be we now see Sony's plan for it's shot at a million-plus subscriber MMO.</p>

<p>Quote:</p>

<p>"But I think its safe to say that both Sigil and SOE see the potential of a mind blowing game by the end of the year. Whats needed, bottom line, is some time, and how to get that time is whats being worked out. And so I still see a 500k+ game, I was just off by a year for a variety of reasons, some under my control, many not. And I think SOE sees this as well. To pull it off however, requires a funded and supported Sigil and a well marketed Vanguard with these different target audiences identified and solid plan on how to reach them all, and then a solid execution of said plan, hitting them hard, pushing these WoW everywhere point of purchase materials from the front to the very back.. In the meantime, the Vanguard that was launched in early 2007 continues to move forward, with much of what Ive talked about patched in over time, and the rest in the first expansion (or re-launch, or whatever we all agree upon in terms of product and service placement)."</p>

<p>This one section says a lot to me about the state of the game for Vanguard and the expected influx of SOE resources (people, money and man hours) associated of getting to this point of the "New" vision.</p>

<p>If Brad's "newly, updated, improved, Vision" from his sound bites above come true, I see a totally new game in SoH by year end or 1QTR 2008.  What does this mean for EQ IMO.....even less of what you have received now in the short term.  I see some potential major sacrifices on the part of EQ to fund (meaning overall resources) this new venture if SOE jumps in the game as both SOE/Sigil may seem vigilant to try and take down the GIANT called WoW.</p>

<p>It's a market trend, and it means that for the staff they can lead more "normal" lives. Given that they stay up during cycle releases for hours on end and what not.. it's just not healthy. Older you get, the more you own and have the more it owns you. There's a bit about also employee retention.<br />

<p>"What the game needs is a re-launch of sorts, including targeted marketing campaigns, an all-around successful move by gamers to the next generation of hardware, continued good word of mouth viral marketing by those who are already playing, enjoying, and re-subscribing."</p>

<p>Stop living in the past. With all the alternatives available today, you don't get a second kick at the can. Customers will no longer put up with the premature launch of a buggy game and will not fund its development. Your "vision" of 500K subscribers for an EQ style timesink with the added bonus of the "SOE experience" (poor quality, incompetent marketing, adversarial customer service, broken promises or outright lies) is a pipe dream.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Brogan on May  7, 2007 10:26 PM</strong></p>
<p>People that think a game can overcome a catastrophic launch are in for a big dissapointment in my opinion.</p>

<p>You get one chance to launch. Do it well and you may have a bright future. Do it poorly and you will probably never recover, no matter how much you improve the game later. EQ and WoW both had "IT" at launch, and both were polished enough that the bugs were mostly just annoying.</p>

<p>Those that failed miserably at launch have never reached their initial numbers again. VG missed its opportunity.</p>

_______________________________________</p>

<p>Except Sony doesn't have a history of doing "just some tweaking" to games when they attempt to turn them around. If they get creative control of Vanguard in the deal, or buy it outright, expect to see a major changes at some point. See SWG and  EQ2 as evidence, moreso with SWG. They made some big changes to those games to try to garner more interest in them.</p>

<p>In any case I agree with what others have said. You get one chance to get it right, at release. People no longer have to, or are willing to, tolerate buggy, overly demanding (hardwarewise and timewise) or unfinished games. There is way too much competition out there so that if a game gets a bad rep because of a hasty release, people will not give it a second look. You would think after years of company after company making the mistake of releasing too early having their games flop (or at least not come close to subscription expectations) that some would learn, some never do though. If Vanguard is supposed to be as much better as Brad claims it will be by the end of the year, then perhaps they should've waited till the end of the year to release it.</p>

<p>As for the new schedule for EQ expansions, whatever. EQ will probably be around for at least another 5 years but it will be a shadow of it's former glory. It doesn't matter to me because I stopped playing nearly 3 years ago and never intend on going back. Why should I when I have a gazillion better choices? Still I do find the whole MMO industry intersting and love watching it evolve so I'll be watching what happens to EQ with curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: xsi on May  8, 2007 03:04 PM</strong></p>
<p>I guess I'll chime in as the sole voice of optimism here. :P  I think it's a good thing, believe it is largely motivated by complaints over the quality of recent expansions (and, most likely, lagging sales on the spring expansions), and think the result will be a single larger, more polished expansion each year, with the dev team hopefully also having time to pursue zone revamps and new models.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm drinking SOE kool-aid, but I've been hoping they'd switch to yearly expansions for a while now.. and, until we see evidence otherwise, I'm going to hope this means good things for the game.</p>

<p>We won't really know until Nov. 2008 anyway.</p>

<p>As for Vanguard... eh.  Don't play it.  I've heard some great things about LoTR despite it being a turbine game, so may try that, but I'm also sticking with EQ for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Redhenna on May  8, 2007 04:32 PM</strong></p>
<p>I supect that this descision had zero to do with Vanguard.  I believe SoE has deep enough pockets to not have to steal from EQ to help get Vanguard to where it needs to be, and certainly does not need to limit expansions for EQ to pay for Vanguard.</p>

<p>I suspect the reason for the change is due to a steady decline in overall EQ population, and the resultant reduction in expansion sales.  SoE feels a need to do something to try and reverse the trend, and so are trying what worked for EQ2, which is taking longer on an expansion(The last EQ2 expansion was very well recieved, with positive comments on it's longer development cycle).  Combine that with a significant player outcry for a longer expansion cycle, and more polish for expansions, and I think they see this as a way to retain players better, reduce costs a bit, and maybe encourage old players to return.</p>

<p>Will it work?  I dunno.  It could work, and will have some positive aspects to it for sure.  More polish, more testing time, more development time will allow for fewer bugs, more completeness, and for a larger feel to each expansion.  The biggest risks are if they can release enough with each expansion to keep players interested for a year(running out of things to do in an expansion is not as bad when the next is two months off, as opposed to running out of things to do with 6 months to wait), and the fact that they cannot afford a bad expansion any more due to the very long time between expansions(ie, 1 year with a PoR crap expansion being current would not be fun).</p>

<p>A couple other possible concerns are that, with a one year cycle, they limit some of their flexability.  Right now, no new AA's every other expansion is not too bad, but with a 1 year cycle time, you would pretty much have to include AA's every single expansion as one example.</p>

<p>Another concern is with the next expansion.  It has to have enough to keep players going for a full year, but does not have that full year development time.  It is very important that this next expansion does not come off as rushed, has a whole lot to do, and is reasonably complete on release.</p>

<p>Overall, this could be an overall good thing, if done properly.  If the expansions have the polish, the testing, enough content and things to do to carry player interest for a full year, then this might work well.  Some one suggested here that each of these expansions should include all previous content in the purchase price, and I agree, each should be something that new players can use to access EQ.  If this is done, and done right, it could be a great thing for EQ...but if it is done poorly, it has the potential to be very very bad for the game overall.  A game can lose alot of subscriptions over a year, for just one bad expansion.</p>
