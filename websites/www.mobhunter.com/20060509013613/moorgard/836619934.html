<html><head><title>Clearing the Slate</title></head><body><h1>Clearing the Slate</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-07-21</p><BIG>Putting the Pets to Bed</BIG><p>When Rich Waters first posted about the upcoming changes to the way pet resistances will work, pet classes of course got nervous. Sure, it sounded like a good thing, but what if the pet's master had really low resistances and the pet ended up weaker by the change rather than stronger?<p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000629.html">stepped in</a> to clarify the situation a bit over on Dev Corner:<p><B>Summoned pets will use his owner's resists and level against NPC spells unless the pet has a natural resistance that makes them immune or mostly so. Note: This only affects summoned pets and it will no [sic] affect spells cast by PCs - we don't want to make a change that might dramatically change PvP until we know more about the effect it might have.<p>For example, fire elemental pets have incredibly high fire resistance, but low resistance to other type of magic. If someone tries to cast a fire-based spell on this pet, it will use its innate fire resistance because it's so high. If someone tries to cast a poison spell on the pet, it will use it's owner's current poison resistance score instead.<p>We've also added a bit more information to the /pet report health function. It will list the pet's current effects along with its health.</B><p>In other words, the pet gets the best of both worlds. It will use the owner's resistance if that is higher, otherwise it will use its own. And as Casters Realm <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4414">clarified</a>, this will be a dynamic process that gets checked on every spell that hits the pet.<p>Please note that, as Alan pointed out, this whole affair only affects spells cast by NPCs. The PvP world of the Zek servers won't be impacted, so all you griefers can relax.<p><BIG>Other Test Additions</BIG><p>A reader named Mirross parsed the latest patch on Test server and found a few new spells thrown into the mix:<p><B>Curse of the Shrine:<p>45% snare.<br>200hp dd.<br>LURE. Disease resist. (Note - doesn't add dis counters so not cureable).<br>300 feet range PB AOE, lasts 1.8 mins. Recast 1 minute.<br>Message: &quot;You are cursed by the spirits of the shrine&quot;.<p>Crusader's Banishment<p>Teleport to -210,-730 in skyshrine<br>Range 100.<br>Recast 45 seconds.<br>Target: Any (that means single).<br>Message: &quot;You have been banished&quot;.<p>Will of the Crusader<p>Reduce attack speed by 75%<br>Dispells 1 buff.<br>100hp DD<br>LURE magic resist.<br>Targetted AE, 200 range.<br>1 minute recast. Duration 1.5 mins.<br>Message: &quot;The will of the Crusader envelopes you.&quot;<p>Dismal Rage of the Shrine<p>Decrease attack by 200<br>Decrease Aggro multiplier by 85% (like emp DD)<br>250dd. Push target up by 5, back by 3.<br>Decrease AC by 30.<br>Unresistable single target spell.<br>30 second recast. 8 hour duration.<br>Message: &quot;The rage of the Shrine consumes you.&quot;</B><p>The paladins got <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=16053.topic">all excited</a> when they saw the word &quot;crusader&quot; in these spells, thinking they might be used by one of the paladin deities in Planes of Power. And they could be--though it would be odd for Karana or Mith Marr to be banishing people to Skyshrine. Maybe changes are afoot in the dragons' town. If so, either Yelinak is being seriously uberfied or he's being replaced by somebody a lot more badass than he is. Replacing a Velious boss at this stage in the game doesn't seem real likely, though. Better to replace the bugged Ring of Vulak with some really tough mofo (hint hint).<p>Another spell that the pallys found does pretty clearly seem to be a PoP addition:<p><B>Graveyard Sending1 <p>Slot Description <br>1: Teleport to -2104,-1939 in ponightmare <p>Mana: 0 Skill: Innate <br>Casting Time: 0 Recast Time: 0 <br>Fizzle Time: 0 Resist: Unresistable <br>Range: 100 Location: Any <br>Time of Day: Any Target Type: Targeted AE <br>Spell Type: Detrimental</B><p>This might be one of the things that sends your corpse to the Graveyard area if you can't get to it within a certain period of time.<p>The thing with new spells on Test server is that they could change or be removed at any time, and in fact may simply be red herrings thrown in by Rich Waters or somebody. In other words, don't bank on 'em going live.<p>The strongest evidence, though, that all these spells have something to do with Planes of Power is the arrival of a <a href="http://pub21.ezboard.com/feqtestregistryfrm14.showMessage?topicID=666.topic">new guild</a> on Test server. The Pantheon--apparently a guild from the Innoruuk server--has been copied over to Test with all their gear intact under rather hush-hush circumstances. What could they have been brought there to test? How about all those spiffy new planes?<p>We may not ever know the truth, but speculating sure is fun.<p><BIG>Where Everybody Knows Your Name</BIG><p>The promised <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/renames/">list of name changes</a> is finally up, so here's your chance to check up on that applicant to your guild and find out if he or she is hiding a shady past. Funny how there are so few changes listed on Stormhammer--the only server where the service is free. One assumes the list doesn't take into account all the changes that took place on Legends before you could do it on the ghetto servers.<p>When will Verant become more progressive and offer a gender change service to its customers? Until then, I'll just have to keep working on that suit of skin in my basement.<p><I>Put the lotion in the @#$%ing basket!</I><p><BIG>A Question of Service</BIG><p>Verant posted a new <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/faqs/faq_cs_contact.jsp">Customer Support FAQ</a> that's worth a look. It covers what you should do in a lot of situations, such as getting harassed, losing your corpse, or getting stuck under the world. It also covers how to report violations to the naming policy--one of my favorite pastimes. I've reported more jackasses with stupid names than I can count.<p>I think Verant needs to work up a separate FAQ for uberguilds. Maybe Absor could post some responses to some frequently asked uber questions, such as:<p>Q. My guild just killed an ubermob and the loot sucks. How can I get it upgraded?<p>Q. We've been camping a boss mob's spawn point for 12 hours and it still hasn't popped. Can a GM spawn it for us?<p>Q. Some n00b is camping spawns in Dawnshroud for exp and is keeping me from my Vex Thal shard. Can you ban his account until I get my quest item?<p>Now that's the kind of information customers really need.
