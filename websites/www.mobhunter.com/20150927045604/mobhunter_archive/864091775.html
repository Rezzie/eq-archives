The server is sending the client the wrong faction name. Also, if a faction change would affect three factions, it's often displaying all three faction names as the same.<br>Faction updates on characters are working correctly, this is only affecting the displayed faction name that you see.<p>Because this isn't causing any issues with character faction, we don't plan to patch to fix this until our regularly scheduled patch. A patch to fix this would require taking all servers down, and especially considering yesterday, we'd rather leave them up and let you all play. I just wanted to reassure you that it's just a goofy message error, not a problem with the actual faction of characters.<p>http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000503.html<p>It's not really possible. There's no way to know how much a character gained or lost during the time that this bug existed. We apologize to those that didn't get as much experience as they earned. Those that gained from it get to keep the boon of this particular bug.<p>http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000506.html<p>You can view your character information at http://legends.everquest.com. Just sign in with your Station name and password and you'll see a My Character button. If you have multiple characters on the server you can pick one from the drop-down list in the upper right. It's all pretty snazzy.
