By that I mean you can actually use it in most situations without slowing down your system to an unusable level. Wizards actually got some cool animations for <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=21021.topic">Ice Comet</a> and <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=21038.topic">Manaburn</a>. Other classes are <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=6828.topic">not so impressed</a>, but hey, the system is still in progress. If you want to turn the particles off, just open the Options window, stretch the bottom edge of the window down a bit, and set the particles to off and opacity to zero. Now you're free and clear.<p>The <a href="http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=12023.topic">Sleeper's Tomb revamp</a> did go live, even though a lot of servers had to have the zone popped manually for the change to take effect.<p>Legends, by the way, got a <a href="http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/newsview.jsp?o=51863">Skyshrine revamp</a> that the regular servers will probably see around the time PoP becomes available.<p><BIG>The Bad</BIG><p>It was a rough day to be a bard. The new patch introduced all kinds of stacking issues, broken songs, and changes to the way illusions work. What's new, right? Well, Absor stopped over at the bard board to offer <a href="http://pub105.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=15169.topic">an apology</a>:<p><B>It seems that I come here far to often with my head bowed to beg forgiveness. But here I am again.<p>I had written a note to myself to get something into the patch message about the illusion stacking changes on bards songs. I failed to do so. I'm very sorry. There's nobody to blame for this but me.<p>Let me address some of the concerns that have come up as a result of my foolishness.<p>The following items are bugs and should be fixed with a patch that we expect to push tonight.<p>1. The Epic effect, Siren's Song and Nature's Melody interrupting songs.<p>2. Avatar overwriting the epic.<p>3. Epic proc should now be affected by Singing Master, not Instrument Mastery.<p>4. The epic and Rondo should now stack.<p>However... the change to the stacking of illusions was intentional (and should most certainly have been mentioned in the patch message - again, I'm sorry). It seems pretty obvious to me that stacking illusions doesn't make a lot of sense.<p>I think that covers everything. But please let me know if I missed something and I'll look into it.</B><p>Bards don't have a lot of faith in patch day, and this business didn't boost anyone's confidence, I'm sure.<p>Just so the bards didn't feel all alone, shadowknights also <a href="http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=6fc3a03d686d89ebb01e0722c3cae520&amp;threadid=6017">got the shaft</a> and didn't receive the spells that were promised to be found in Echo Caverns. Expect this to be fixed in the patch, according to Absor.<p><BIG>The Ugly</BIG><p>Crashes. Lockups. More crashes.<p>That pretty much sums up how a lot of people spent their afternoon. There was a thread on the Technical Help board that offered <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/031634.html">some fixes</a>, consisting mostly of:<p>- use /filter badword to turn off the profanity filter<p>- turn off spell effects with /showspelleffects off<p>- Delete the SpellEffects folder in your EQ directory<p>Those tips seemed to help, but there were a bunch of issues with the new UI windows that caused other people to crash. Post-patch crashiness is one of the downfalls of a custom user interface system that people will just have to live with, most likely.<p>Chat channels were out of commission most of the day as well. While this isn't gamebreaking per se, it certainly makes you realize how much you've come to depend on chat channels for mini-raids, loot calls, and general BSing.<p>The biggest, ugliest screwup in the patch, though, was the <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3031

">complete buggering of the aggro system</a>. If you tried to fight any kind of boss mob after the patch, you know what I mean. You could forget rampage control, managing healing aggro, or anything of the sort. Basically, people seemed to get aggro in no particular order, making even previously trivial fights highly difficult for many guilds. And I don't mean lamers, I mean highly skilled players.<p>A patch day like this makes one wonder how much testing was done on these changes. Sure, any programmer knows that you can't always anticipate how changing code in one place will affect something else, but c'mon... most of these problems should have been caught long before making it live. It really causes people to dread new features, because so much of the time their introduction means that we'll be having bugs and downtime for days afterwards.<p>Anyway, here's Friday's new patch message:<p><B>September 27, 2002  1:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>This patch fixes a number of issues that first arose in yesterday's patch.  We apologise for the additional downtime.  <p>- Zones should be considerably more stable.<p>- Item links no longer cause display lockups.<p>- NPCs once again choose their targets properly.<p>- Gravity Flux-type spells again function properly.<p>- The Guildmasters of Sanctus Seru are no longer quite as mean as they were previously.<p>- Ring of Flamewarding is again wearable by Wizards.  <p>Thank you for your patience, and have a good weekend!</B><p>No mention of the bard stuff. Go figure!<p>Post below if you find any new bugs introduced that we can look forward to being patched away tomorrow.<p>Oh, and just in case you wondered why hoarding AAXP points is no longer allowed, <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1047.topic">check out this Planar Advancement menu</a>. Now those are some expensive skills, bub.
