If teenage boys weren't moved by Kunark's shots of FiVie in chains with her chest heaving, this image is guaranteed to send them all running for the Vaseline and locking their bedroom doors.

<P>It seems Mistress Vie likes to be spanked with that naughty staff of hers. All that's missing is the black leather bondage outfit.

<P>Could Luclin be EverQuest's first NC-17 expansion? Check the poster out <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/display.cgi?/eqshots/eqluclin1.jpg">here</a> and judge for yourself.

<P>P.S. What is the Kerran doing to that wolf, anyway?
