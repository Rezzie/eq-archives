<h1 class="article_title">Flagging and Attunement: Blizzard Gets It, SOE Doesn't</h1>
<p>by Loral on March 08, 2008</p>

<p>In their <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html">patch notes for version 2.4</a> of World of Warcraft, Blizzard removed the attunement requirements for entering Mount Hyjal, Black Temple, and Karazhan. These three raid zones have been the cornerstone of raiding in the Burning Crusade expansion. Until now, these zones have required a series of quests and instances in order for a player to enter the raid. With this patch, that requirement will disappear.</p>

<p>The same week that this was announced, my wife's Everquest guild went back to Planes of Power twice to get a few guild members flagged for the upcoming Everquest anniversary Fabled boss mobs. Planes of Power is over five years old now. Five years and SOE still hasn't released the flags of Planes of Power.å</p>

<p>Flag restrictions break guilds apart. Flag restrictions alienate players. Flag restrictions make it harder for players in a massive online game to play together. It is contrary to the primary purpose of an online RPG: bringing people together.</p>

<p>Flags can kill an MMO. Blizzard understands this. SOE does not.</p>

<p>For six years I've discussed flagging with game developers and other players. I've read all the articles about it. I've pontificated about it with hundreds of players; some who take a practical big picture approach, some more narrow-minded and exclusive. Everyone has an opinion about flagging and I will admit that, in some circumstances, it has a place. However, that place is fluid and changing - not static.</p>

<p>I've discussed flagging in numerous interviews with designers for Everquest. They have stated to me that the days of flagging entire expansions, like Planes of Power and Gates of Discord, are over. They state that the difficulty of the content will be the requirement for entering and battling in a zone. They state that any flagging will be minor and require very little for those who wish to enter.</p>

<p>Yet flags remain. New expansions still require quests to enter zones. Older zones continue to have the flags they required upon release. The designs intended to keep guilds that play four hours a day, seven days a week, from progressing too fast now get in the way of guilds that play far less often.</p>

<p>Flagging has wrecked guilds. Struggling guilds that lose members often have to recruit new members without flags, forcing the guild to move back to previously defeated raids. Now long-time members find themselves spending hours on raids they already defeated a year back in order to flag a handful of new people. These veterans, seeing how their time is wasted on events they no longer enjoy, rightfully leave to find better ways to use their time. Now the guild itself is even further back than before.</p>

<p>I have watched guilds self destruct like this for years. The guild that first entered Plane of Time on my server broke apart because flagging for Demiplane of Blood became too much of a burden. Now I see the same thing happening again with guilds facing those same flags today.</p>

<p>Flags also prevent players from returning to their game of choice. A player might leave a game and return half a year later to find that their friends have progressed so far as to leave that player behind. The guild either chooses to spend their time in raids they have long since defeated or that player cannot rejoin them. In a game as old as Everquest, any barrier keeping older players returning hurts their business.</p>

<p>People were surprised when Blizzard announced they would be opening up the attunement restrictions for their top raid zones in Burning Crusade. There was a public outcry from those who had spent their time attuning their characters and their guilds. They felt the removal of this attunement cheapened the time they spent "working" to get into these high-end zones.</p>

<p>Blizzard didn't listen. Blizzard sees a game with ten million players and knows that most of those players don't post on the forums, don't read the websites, and don't have the time to attune and re-attune others for high-end raid zones. Though the game doesn't often stress social interaction, they know that flagging hurts the ability for players to play together in these high-end zones. They learned that the requirement for flagging to slow down top end players ceases to exist when those players are well past the top end. They learned that attunement should be fluid and changing - not static walls that must always stay in place.</p>

<p>I managed to acquire my attunement for Karazhan over about two weeks. I fought through all the solo quests. I begged my way in to the three required instances. When I first stepped in, I remember how it felt to finally enter the zone for which I had spent those hours. Like many, when I heard the attunement would be dropped, my immediate visceral animal reaction was one of jealousy and pack security. How dare those who worked not at all enter the zone for which I worked so hard! That moment disappeared quickly. I know why Blizzard did it, and they were right to do so.</p>

<p>It would be inaccurate to state that World of Warcraft's high numbers and the dwindling numbers in Everquest are strictly due to flagging. These flagging restrictions in Everquest aren't the biggest barrier for new or returning players. The steep level and alternate advancement requirements are worse. Flagging, however, is the largest barrier for high level players. Flagging grinds up guilds and spits out those who remain. Some end up in a smaller and smaller number of high-end guilds. Others leave the game completely.</p>

<p>All is not lost for Everquest's flagging woes. SOE could, and should, take an aggressive stance on the removal of flags for older expansions. Removing flagging for every zone and raid in every expansion up to and including Prophecy of Ro would be a good start. Removing flagging for every expansion older than a year would be the next logical choice. Alas, such aggressive moves are not SOE's style. They choose to play it conservative, making small changes over long periods of time. This is wise. Why alienate the players they have left? Yet this must be balanced against the damage that older flags inflict on lower-tiered guilds.</p>

<p>Flagging and attunement requirements work against the strongest draw of massive online games. They prevent players from playing together.</p>

<p>Planes of Power?  Heck, doesn't Vex Thal still need a key to enter?  For that matter, doesn't ST?  Keying for those older areas probably isn't all that hard anymore (I don't know, I don't play EQ anymore), but that it's even still there is kind of crazy.</p>

<p>Flagging: I agree to some point about flagging needing to be there for when the hardcore guilds tackle the expansion...relaxed (bit not removed) for the mid tier guilds hit it & removed for the social/family & casual guilds hit it.</p>

<p>After content is one year old ..lower the number of tasks/flags required after two remove/lift flag requirements, & do this each yeae.</p>

<p>However:</p>

<p>There should be some form of recognised reward for anyone wishing to actually work through the flagging content, be it a clicky of some kind or a title, or a charm item, or a trinket.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Kiztent on March 10, 2008 09:16 AM</strong></p>
<p>In regard to the first comment, keying for VT is retarded stupid, if I remember right.  A classic run all over Luclin and get rare drops from rare spawns quest.</p>

<p>As far as the kara keying goes... it's pretty easy.  Huntsman and Moroes are pretty good 'gear check' bosses.  Not like you'll see much of Kara if you can't down them, so who cares if people can zone in.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Redhenna on March 10, 2008 12:44 PM</strong></p>
<p>Flagging needs to change, for all the reasons Loral mentioned.  Flagging for a current expansion is fine, if done in moderation, butt after a period of time, 1 to 2 years, the flag has served it purpose, and needs to go.  Unfortunately, 2 things happening recently mean this is unlikely to be even considered.</p>

<p>Cultural armor in SoF, when combined with a last blood aug, is overpowered for what is required to get it.  That is a problem, but a small problem if handled correctly(ie beta test, and/or fix immediately).  Unfortunately, SoE handled it as wrongly as they could, telling players that this ungodly expensive armor was, in fact, intended to be as powerful as it was.  Players then sunk unreal amounts of PP(it could take up to a million or more PP for a full set of this armor)...then SoE realized that, in fact, this stuff was too good.  By now it was too late really to fix it, and after much debate, decided to leave it alone, as it will be a short lived issue.  A vocal segment of the high end populous is incensed(partly because many had threatened to quit over this if not fixed, and now they look foolish not quitting...not that they ever where going to).</p>

<p>SoE announced a plan to increase AA experience at low AA counts.  Basically, if there is a multiplier added to AA exp, and the lower your AA count, the higher the multiplier.  Some loud high end players are, not surprisingly, totally and completely pissed over this.  How dare SoE help players other than themselves?  Despite the fact that these people have zero reasonable arguments, they are spamming the boards, making it look controversial.  Truth is, of course, very few people are anything other than totally for the SoE plan, but those against it are throwing an all out hissy fit.</p>

<p>With those two things going on, I suspect SoE is going to avoid anything right now that might benefit non high end players.  It's sad, but it's the truth.  High end players like to refer to the 'Mentality of Entitlement", claiming that lower end players think they deserve special consideration...ignoring that high end players think they should get the special treatment, and ignoring that lower end players did not ask for unbalanced cultural armor, or this AA exp change.</p>

<p>Among MMO players are some of the whiniest, loudest people around.  I should know, I am one of them.  The unfortunate truth is that these people can, and do, get in the way of developers making needed, good changes.</p>

<p>The real problem with flags is that they are character based, not guild based.</p>

<p>It makes sense to have a way to force guilds to progress through content, but its silly to enforce this at the character level.</p>

<p>It would be way harder to implement, but it also would be much more useful for the comunity, if flags of these types were a "sit based" deal than a direct character thing.</p>

<p>Imagine if every time a given guild ran a "flagging process" they didnt flag the members of the group but instead aquired entrance tickets for each member of the process. If 5 members were present, they earn 5 tickets.</p>

<p>Every time the guild wants to enter a raid zone, they automatically hug a ticket, so if a guild has 100 tickets they can have 100 players raiding that zone at once (makes more sense if the zone is instance based as it allows for multiple raids to go on at once.)</p>

<p>Such a ticket based system would do wonders for guilds in any game. For one, its a guild asset that can be used as a "benefit for joining". </p>

<p>It also can be a more quantifiable guild progression system. New guilds start in zero, just as new characters start at level 1. </p>

<p>Finally it establishes a system that locks out new content from guilds, yet wont force players to return in 5 years for more flagging.</p>

<p>Theoretically, a guild may have to redo flagging if their ranks grow large enough for their current concurrent roster to enter these raid zones at once.</p>

<p>This system can be kept hand in hand with the current character flagging so that solo players that quit guilds can still enter flagged zones if they were part of at least one flag acquisition team.</p>

<p>Loral,</p>

<p>Good article.  I agree that while flagging is not the deathnell of EQ MMO issues.  It certainly is the cockblock on joining a guild and on recrouting to a guild.</p>

<p>As some know, I was a long long time player of the enchanter class.  When the raid guild I was in dissolved I chose to roll a shaman.  Simple reason being that at that time (I don't know about now) enchanters where generating more agro for less effect and had essentially no defenses vs. the mob DPS by comparison to a shaman.  Net effect was enchanters where getting fewer and fewer non-guild non-raid invites.</p>

<p>So after solo'ing to 70 my shaman began solo aa grinding.  After 100 aa's solo I took a look around the "raiding" guild on The Nameless.  Fully 100% required new members to be Anguish flagged.  No exceptions.  With an understanding you'd either "solo" them (which ment 3 boxing by most descriptions), or joining a lower level guild, using them as a tool to get flagged, then leaving them.</p>

<p>That canabalistic approach to using others as a tool was one of the hand full of reasons I tossed in the towel.</p>

<p>Removal of essentially dead weight flags/keys, etc., would go a long way to stopping that practice.</p>

<p>Everquest would be a different game if they opened up all the flagging back through The Serpent Spine. I can't imagine anyone would leave because of it that wouldn't or shouldn't leave anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Redhenna on March 11, 2008 02:06 AM</strong></p>
<p>I bet a few would threaten to though.  They would use the exact same tired arguments, threaten to cancel there eleventy-four accounts, and generally throw a hissy fit over it.</p>

<p>Between the cultural armor outcry, the aa change outcry, and the levitate change outcry, the official boards have been about as stupid as I can ever remember them.</p>

<p>I've often felt like EQ's main problem was that the devs listened too much (one might say, exclusively) to their hardcore playerbase.  I'm happy to see them start to make changes that appear intended to benefit the game as a whole, in spite of the potential outcry.  And I'm happy to see a lot of people on the boards come forth in support of the changes, whether they benefit them personally or not.  But, man... the venom and rhetoric being spewed by a few posters is just unreal.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Naagin on March 11, 2008 07:30 AM</strong></p>
<p>Another upcoming change in Everquest is the new class correspondent set up. Rumors say the whiny high end players will be targetted for inclusion and will have to sign an NDA once in the program. </p>

<p>I see this as reversing the current EQ trends and a shifting back to "catering to the ubers" will begin anew, effectively killing the idea of flag releases after x amount of time goes by.</p>

<p>P.S. Flagging on a guild level vs a player level is BRILLIANT.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Skuz Bukit on March 11, 2008 08:41 AM</strong></p>
<p>I really like the "guild flag" idea , it would help EVERY guild a ton, flagged members leaving mid-tier guilds can totally wreck their progression while they are forced to yet again reflag new members for the billionth time.</p>

<p>More things like that please.</p>

<p>Also I'd even go so far as to make gear "guild-flagged" whatever you earn on a raid with your guild, gets stripped if you leave, wanna go elsewhere? let them gear you up.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loxyll on March 11, 2008 02:33 PM</strong></p>
<p>Wow!  I really like the guild flag idea.  I am a long time but casual player (over 7 years and 7 Veteran AA's to prove it).  With my playing habits I know there are zones I'll never be able to see because there is absolutely no way I can take time to get flagged.   Associating flags to guilds would be fantastic and as was mentioned in an earlier quote, would be a great recruiting point.</p>

<p>I hope SoE has the since to look at the bigger picture and not the whiners.</p>

<p>"I hope SoE has the sense to look at the bigger picture and not the whiners."</p>

<p>This isn't meant to be an attack on you, just seems appropriate starting point.</p>

<p>Everquest is the bigger picture.  It's not a single person's perspective, or 1000, it is, what it is.  Being the truth that this is, Everquest has been doomed to collapse under the weight of it's own player's wishes, complaints, visions, expectations, needs and wants.  Players, my friends, are "the problem".</p>

<p>Thankfully I accept and understand this concept, probably why I'm still enjoying Everquest.  Acceptance people, acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: naagin on March 12, 2008 07:18 AM</strong></p>
<p>You're missing the point the original article and most of us in the comments section are making.</p>

<p>"Players" aren't the problem.<br />
"Short-sighted, loud, and listened to" players are. Because they do not represent the vast majority of subscribers.</p>

<p>The only thing leading to the collapse of EQ are a lack of marketing and a history of the game swinging back and forth on class abilities, nerfs, and flagging requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Kaelon on March 12, 2008 03:08 PM</strong></p>
<p>It also isn't just the flagging/attunement that Blizzard gets - it's also the loot.  Consider how they continue to make the same or better gear available on alternate paths.  With Patch 2.4, players will be able to obtain gear that is superior to Black Temple gear by either solo-ing or 5-manning in instances and Heroics.  This builds on the previous tradition of enabling solo-ing PvP'ers to get competitive gear to PvE high-end items.  However, the latest changes place gear in the hands of badge collectors, rather than elite raiders.  Excellent move!</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Brubel on March 12, 2008 03:19 PM</strong></p>
<p>I really enjoyed EQ when I played but realize I could never go back and play it.  I don't have the time to devote to a mass keying/flagging timesink.  I stopped playing just at the ends of the PoP and beginning of Omens.  The content seems to be geared for large raids and that play style is no longer for me.</p>

<p>I do play WoW very casually and am glad to hear about the flagging requirments going the way of the DoDo Bird.  If I have time and get to that level; I'll still try do some of the attunement quests.  Glad they can see the light where SOE can only see burnt out bulbs.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: RetiredEQ'r on March 12, 2008 06:17 PM</strong></p>
<p>I retired from EQ in Janurary, partly as I needed to change directions in my life, and partly because of huge issues such as the articles topic.</p>

<p>There are many things which motivate a player to continue to play, or to finally say enough is enough.</p>

<p>This article is just one, but for me it was a pretty huge one.</p>

<p>Like the proposed aa exp changes (that are not yet live), I think they may be finally starting to realize they need to do more to keep new blood flowing and ease some of the requirements over time so both new and returning players do not have to go through the motions of ~9 years of content (or however much was missed by the returning player) just to catch up to current.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Moreau on March 13, 2008 02:16 AM</strong></p>
<p>I will keep this short tonight.  I agree with Loral that the older flags need to be removed.  I cannot see a guild seriously pursuing Planes of Power content when superior armor is available to farming groups or in the bazaar.  Those old raid zones are no longer part of the bragging rights list.  I personally think that Demiplane of Blood is a bit early (level 70), but everything at level 65 seems deserted (Planes/Gates).  So, it is probably best to drop the flagging and just let people roam free and enjoy the sights of yesterday, just as they do with zones from original 1999 EverQuest (level 50).</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Brewall on March 14, 2008 11:07 AM</strong></p>
<p>Flags on content older than one year should be removed and is long overdue.  Zone flags were put in place to slow people down from consuming the content too quickly.  With 9 years of expansions, there is no need to slow down old content.</p>

<p>Let's face it, having people pay for a new expansion but use content from 3-4 years ago is not something that is going to retain people.  If you bought a new car and had to drive around in your old clunker - you would not be happy. If you then had to keep driving it - you would sell them all and drive something else.  Sony's goal should be to have uber guilds at latest content and majority of players an expansion behind.  This will ease recruitment, and keep people with latest graphics and content - plus generate excitement/sales for new expansions. More sales = more development funds. I would find it hard to believe uber guilds would argue that majority of players should be multi-expansions behind.  If they do, their hubris is killing the game and should be removed from any recomendation group.</p>

<p>Remove flags, and add character badges of honor. Each old flag earned shows on your character that you defeated it.  No bonuses, but a status symbol and recognition that you achieved something.</p>
