But leave it to the folks at GameSpy (Damn you and your scoops! Damn you!) to bring us the first real facts.<p>Shawn Lord, who has crawled forth from his shadowed cubicle at SOE to become lead designer on LDoN, gave GameSpy an <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/interviews/june03/eqldonpc/">interview</a> on what we'll see in the upcoming expansion. His Lordship gives us a summary of what the latest chapter in the saga of Norrath will be about:<p><B>The Lost Dungeons of Norrath is designed to bring back the thrill of the dungeon crawl. There's a certain sense of danger that comes along with being a small group of heroes traveling into the depths of a dark cavern seeking adventure. LDoN is built for single groups of characters that want to push their way through a dungeon from beginning to end. There won't be any &quot;camping&quot; of spawns. To further your adventure you'll have to forge ahead and see what lies in wait for you in the gloom around the next bend.</b><p>It sounds like there have been an awful lot of lost dungeons floating around:<p><B>More than 40 adventure zones, dozens of new NPCs and, well, the whole thing is about quests that take you into these new zones with a goal to accomplish.</b><p>The zones themselves may not be overwhelmingly massive, though, as it sounds like they are designed to take a couple hours for the typical group to complete them.<p>If you're afraid of additional levels ruining game balance yet again, you can rest easy:<p><B>We are not adding any new levels, classes, or races with this expansion. Our focus is on the new technology and all the new adventures that we'll be providing.</b><p>Dungeons will be <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-1738011095">instanced</a>, using what SOE is calling a &quot;Dynamic Dungeon System&quot; (or Dungeon Action System, depending what you read). Apparently this also adjusts the level of content to the people who are undertaking it:<p><B>Only members of your group can access a specific dungeon, and the challenge level of those dungeons is based on the composition of your party. In those dungeons NPCs will not be respawning, once they are killed they stay dead, so camping isn't an option. If you want a new fight, you have to move deeper into the dungeon.</b><p>Interestingly, GameSpy also posted the official SOE press release for LDoN, but it was taken down--presumably since it was dated Monday the 16th. Expect the press release to be circulated then, along with an update of the <a href="http://www.lostdungeonsofnorrath.com/">official site</a>, if the Web team follows its usual pattern. Currently the page shows a map of the old world with little mouseover graphics where the five &quot;environments&quot; will be that lead you into the dungeons themselves. It sounds like these will be Tranquility-like gateways with NPCs that send you to the dungeons:<p><B>The NPC that gives you the adventure will also give you an idea about where that adventure will be located. Getting there is up to you. In fact, some of the challenge to a given adventure may be getting to it. Once your group arrives at the proper location, you will find an entrance. No special items are needed; you just need to have been sent on their adventure by the proper NPC.</b><p>The press release also said that the expansion will be downloadable as well as boxed for retail sale. A good move on SOE's part, given the success of the Legacy of Ykesha extension.<p>So does LDoN serve as the counterbalance to the raid-heavy Planes of Power? With its focus on single-group content, it should make an awful lot of players happy.<p>But what about all the folks who enjoy raiding? I'm not just talking about uberguilds here; there are people who love raiding Kael and ToV and plenty of other places that aren't at the endgame yet. If LDoN doesn't offer at least some raids, I think it would be a big mistake.<p>Yes, PoP is doing a pretty good job of keeping most guilds busy, and non-uber folks have suffered a bit due to the way the expansion was designed. But delivering a new expansion without raid content would be overcompensating too far in the other direction. The folks who will have completed Time when LDoN rolls around will need something to stay interested in the game, and breaking down into units of six so that they can experience new content isn't likely to cut it. After all, the camaraderie of guild raids is a big part of the social appeal of EverQuest.<p>Don't get me wrong--Lost Dungeons has some great ideas for the game, and it does offer something that is sorely lacking for a lot of players right now. But the most successful and praised EQ expansions have always been those that offered a broad range of content to players at all levels in the game--Kunark and Velious come to mind as popular examples. Some combination of PoP and LDoN might have hit the nail perfectly on the head, but as disparate products spread a year apart they might be too specialized to serve the overall good of the game. I think whatever the next expansion beyond LDoN is, it needs to offer compelling content to everyone from level 1 to 65, from the casual player to the hardcore raider. If it doesn't, or if it takes too long to come to market, I suspect a lot of players will be devoting their time to new challenges.<p>Then again, maybe SOE realizes this might be an issue. Notice those polls that have been popping up since the patch?<p><BIG>An Animated Response</big><p>We realize you're all still basking in the glow of this week's patch, but the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp">Upcoming Updates</a> page has been, uh, revised (it's really a pain coming up with alternatives to &quot;updated&quot; to avoid redundancy) with some teasers:<p><B>It's still a bit too early for us to have a lot of details about what we'll be bringing you in our next update, but we can mention a few things.<p>We recently patched a few new animations for the Luclin models to the Test server. We have redone the Run, Walk and Turn animations for those models. This required a rather large amount of data to be downloaded for the folks on Test, but if you're curious you can log in there and check them out. We're going to be working out a way to get those new animations to all the Live servers with minimal impact as soon as we can.<p>We will continue to work on partial revamps of zones and the other items listed in our <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/future_plans.jsp">Future Plans</a>.<p>The next update for this section should be up some time around the start of July.</b><p>I haven't logged onto Test to peek at the new animations yet, but early reports indicate they're a mixed bag. Hey, that's fine, they're still a work in progress, and just about <I>anything</i> would be an improvement.<p>Just to underscore a couple animation points again so they don't get forgotten amidst all this new walking, running, and turning:<p>- Fix the &quot;frozen solid while sitting&quot; problem<br>- Fix the asstastic 2HB animation<p>Hey, I play a monk. Sue me.<p><BIG>Prexus Fall Down, Go Boom</big><p>Absor posted an <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=56698">obituary of sorts</a> for the Prexus server. Well, not really, but it did have a catastrophic failure that made very bad things happen:<p><B>Last night at about 1:00 in the morning Prexus had a severe breakdown. Our Operations team has been working to get it restored and back into service. Our hope is that we'll have it back up and running some time this evening.<p>That's the bad news. The worse news is that we will have to recreate all of the characters on the server from backups that are perhaps more than 24 hours old. Anything those characters have earned in the last day or so will be lost. Unfortunately, we will not be able to restore items or experience lost to the roll back.<p>There is some potential good news, though. If you have deleted a character in the last year or so, that character may return. So if you see a character that you deleted a few months ago on your character select screen, that's why.</b><p>That sucks donkey balls for residents of Prexus, especially if they had just accomplished some major goal or event that was undone as a result. Unfortunately, hardware problems happen, and even the best backup systems in the world don't work all the time. It's somewhat fortunate that a relatively small amount of playtime was lost, considering the apparent severity of the breakdown.<p>Just goes to show you, never trust a water sign.<p>I'm an Aquarius, btw.<p><BIG>So Stay on My Arm, You Little Charmer</big><p>Alan also posted a tidbit on <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=56705">erroneous charm stats</a> that was mildly amusing:<p><B>There is a way (which I'm not going to explain...) to make it look like your charms are gaining a lot of extra stats. If you see this happening, please do not think that your charm actually has those stats and run of thinking that you are now invincible. You're not.<p>This is a visual bug. The stat increase is only on your client, and is not seen nor accepted by our servers. It's not a super charm.<p>We'll fix this bug when we can.</b><p>Awwww, Alan, why take our fun away? I want to know the l337 trick for making my new charm look all uber and stuff! Anyway, who's to say I'm <I>not</i> invincible? /rude<p><BIG>Less Naked Bottoms Per Capita</big><p>Over on the FoH (yesIstillplayandifyouaskmeonemoretimeI'llbanyou!) board, it has been pointed out that a <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=347c1aececcb43a171db4891166122b9&amp;threadid=7593">recent patch to Time</a> made pant patterns drop off some of the gods. This is a good thing, since previously the only place to get elemental leggings was from deities in the elemental planes, which could force Time-capable guilds to keep farming those areas instead of moving past them as they should.<p>Some of the gods in Time were also made beefier, which is of course a mixed blessing for the players at that point in the game. But you take the highs with the lows, I guess.<p>No sign yet of BP molds, but uberguilds still have a ways to go before getting to the end encounter in Time B, so they'll no doubt turn up at some point. Hopefully BPs won't be any more rare than legs in the elemental planes, so at least guilds in Time will have a realistic shot at farming them before moving on.<p>Assuming they have somewhere to move on <I>to,</i> of course.
