The estimated downtime is 8 hours.<p>- The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>These are maintenance downtimes, not patches. Even so, the ubermob respawn cycle gets restarted, so if you're on one of these servers, you get to enjoy the wonders of waiting for your favorite loot target to show up.<p><BIG>Just Down the Street from the Hash Bar</BIG><p>Hey, a new server is on the way for the Euros who have such crappy connections to Verant's boxes in the United States. Next stop--<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000529.html">Amsterdam</a>:<p><B>We're opening a new server, the second EverQuest server to be located outside of the United States.<br>The new server is called Kane Bayle and it will be located in Amsterdam.<p>We will be opening the server as a test server for a while to help test network and connection issues, so we need to have a lot of people testing it out. You will be able to access the new server by running TestEverQuest.exe. Once you do Kane Bayle will be one of the servers on the Test Servers selection screen. Remember, though, that this is a Test server and all of the Test server rules apply.<p>Important note: Because this is a Test server, we will be wiping characters when we take the server Live.<p>Keeping that in mind, we want to encourage you to log into the server and play for a while. We really want to see how it holds up under a full server load, and for that we need players logged in and playing. Now is also a good time to try it out and see if Kane Bayle will provide you EverQuest with a better Internet connection. So please give it a try.<p>Thanks for playing EverQuest, and have fun on Kane Bayle!<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>Methinks the team that set up the new server has a <I>massive</I> case of the munchies right now. Let's just hope the Customs agents can still be bribed. &quot;No way, bro... I have, like, no idea how that got into my suitcase...&quot;<p>Please forgive our rather ham-fisted attempt to make the announcement of another Euro server into something even mildly interesting or worthy of <a href="http://www.google.com/jobs/britney.html">repetition</a>.<p><BIG>See How You Stack Up</BIG><p>A reader named Spytfyre tipped us off to a <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1960">post</a> by Verant's own Scott Hartsman over on the necro board concerning the possibility of stacking DoT spells. It's good reading, even if you know better than to play a necro:<p><B>DoT stacking has been mentioned enough times in the past (both distant and recent) as something we'd consider doing that I'd like to break character and explain in a bit of detail why it's harder than anyone had assumed.<p>(Please bear in mind - I'm still mostly the new guy. I've played forever, but I haven't been on this side of this particular discussion yet. :)<p>UsulDaNeriak wrote:<p><I><h5>as i know BoD doesnt stack. both necs get healed, but one everwrites the others dmg. general opinion i have read so far was, BoD dmg doesnt stack. however, maybe i am wrong.</h5></I><p>You are certainly not wrong. Quite the contrary - You couldn't be more correct. <p>Zarloth wrote:<p><I><h5>I suspect the stacking code is a huge mess. It was made with only a few limited spell lines in mind, and now with all new spells and stuff, the limit is hit.</H5></I><p>The observation that &quot;It was made with only a few limited spell lines in mind...&quot; is 100%, dead-on correct, with all of the associated difficulties that you might assume.<p>Please assume for a moment that some of those difficulties include, for example, an extremely limited amount of storage for each effect (buff/debuff), for each spell, for each PC, for each NPC, and so on.<p>And further, that those extents were excruciatingly painful to change. <p>Sskeli wrote:<p><I><H5>Yes the &quot;who&quot; of the casting is kept track of...how do you think you get the 'your spell has worn off' message?</H5></I><p>...which is an absolutely logical assumption, and the vast majority of the time, it's correct.<p>Unfortunately, there's one problem, and that's the problem that prevents us from just saying, &quot;Yep! We can make this happen. Give me 3 days...&quot;<p>What happens to the &quot;Wears off&quot; message when you log/zone out, then log/zone back in?<p>99% of the time, you don't get it.<p>Unfortunately, the caster's identity is a best-guess. <p>...and therein lies the problem. If we stacked DoTs using the same logic, every DoT in the game would become a zone-in/zone-out exploitfest. <p>Not that the majority of people would do such a thing. We can probably all agree, though, that writing to the majority in this case means that the minority will take undue advantage.<p>That said, there are other changes that we're making that will make this type of change easier. It just takes time to decode what's gone on over the years and make sure the bases are covered.<p>A cleaner, shinier EverQuest will be able to bring this back into the realm of the possible. In the meanwhile, the best that I can offer are my apologies if this is something that was promised that we haven't delivered on.<p>Hope that helps at least a little. :)</B><p>Hartsman is EverQuest's Technical Director, and he's developed a very positive online presence since taking the job. We give a big thumbs up to any Verant employee who actually goes to the players' home turf and communicates with them--especially somebody who isn't afraid of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_1894000/1894775.stm">obsessed</a> and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/serialkillers_figures020325.html">freaky</a> necros.<p><BIG>My Pet, Do You Have a Second?</BIG><p>As the <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=26844.topic">druids pointed out</a> a few days ago (see, I told you we've been slacking), pet summon spells on Test server currently have a one-second cast time. Rich Waters <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4197">commented</a> about this change:<p><B>I wanted to see what the impact would be if pets were all fast casting, pretty much guaranteeing that a character could summon his pet almost anytime. There are concerns about things like chain-casting pets and the effect it could have on soloability for instance. The changes on Test should allow us to see the worst case.<p>I'm not sure whether this particular change will go live or not. I'll see how it looks, and continue experimenting with other aspects of pets as well.</B><p>Pet classes think this change is <a href="http://www.dvdfile.com/software/dvd-video/index.html">cool</a>. Of course, they might be excited by the prospect of 'sploiting it to summon pets continuously one after another, but we'll give them the benefit of the doubt.<p>That's it for the news today, aside from one tiny little message we'd like to pass on to Verant: <B>DON'T RAISE THE LEVEL CAP IN PLANES OF POWER!! DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T!</b><p>Okay, you can go back to sleep now. I know I will.
