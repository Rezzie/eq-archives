And like many players, we found that zones were crashing left and right, and then crashing again. Some people found themselves rolled back to rather unfortunate last save positions.<p>While a popular thing to do was simply to <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=35895.topic">blame the bards</a> (usually a safe bet), it seemed more like these crashes were somehow tied to the health level of boss mobs. Servers were taken down somewhere around 9:30PM eastern last night, with another early morning patch today.<p>It <I>almost</I> seemed that <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/035209.html">server-side filtering</a> was kinda sorta working--after being completely broken for like forever. Packet flow was minimal even on a raid with 50+ people, not pushing 9K like it often does. It was hard to be sure, though, what with zones going down all the time. Maybe it was just a side effect of yet another attempt to make ShowEQ not work again.<p>Another interesting unmentioned patch feature can be found by hitting Alt-N. It's a new story window, presumably to list in-game lore that gets added as we get closer to the next expansion. Maybe Verant finally realized that no one reads their newspapers (if in fact new issues even get added anymore).<p><BIG>Mace Window</BIG><p>Absor made a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53589">rare appearance</a> on Dev Corner yesterday to clarify a few things about the new windowed mode:<p><B>When running EverQuest in a window you may wish to unlock your mouse. To do so, use the SHIFT + ALT + R key combination.<p>You can change that key combination under Options - Keyboard. <p>I also wanted to remind you that ALT + ENTER and ALT + SHIFT + R do not work until you get into the game - character select currently ignores them. <p>We are also aware of an issue that has occurred when trying to use ALT + TAB with EQ in a window with Windows XP. Essentially, Windows XP keeps a list of program compatibility information. Unfortunately, for EverQuest it specifically disables ALT + TAB. We're working on a solution to this issue.</B><p>The windowed mode works pretty well. My biggest gripe is that login and character select screens aren't windowed--hopefully that gets changed soon.<p>EQ's windowed mode seems to handle other applications better than EQW does. For instance, a browser window runs much zippier for most people under native EQ than it did with EQW.<p>By the way, <a href="http://www.eqwindows.com/">EQ Windows</a> was updated to work correctly with the new patch, so fans of the formerly renegade program can now choose which way they prefer to run the game. Of course, EQW is required if you want to two-box on one machine. A lot of people wonder why Verant didn't just implement their windowed mode the same way EQW did it and save everyone a lot of trouble. Who knows.<p>Today Alan again posted, this time helping XP users who want to use <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53598">Alt-Tab</a> to switch applications:<p><B>First, you'll need the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=09DAC794-B803-4B92-83C9-6A9E8B801434">Windows Application Compatibility Toolkit</a>. It's nearly 7 megs. <p>You'll need to download and install the toolkit. Then: <br>Open the Compatibility Administration Tool. <p>At the top go to Search - Query.<br>Search for EverQuest.<br>Double click the item the search finds.<br>Right-Click the EQGame.exe entry and choose <I>Disable.</I></B><p>This is a stopgap measure until Microsoft updates its EQ compatability information. HA! SOE is at someone else's mercy for a change!<p><BIG>Mitigating Circumstances</BIG><p>One of the &quot;features&quot; of Planes of Power is that slow spells can be partially resisted by mobs. Rather than landing for all or nothing, mobs can now have mitigation levels that allow them to be partially slowed.<p>Yesterday's patch introduced some new messages in the eqstr_en.txt file that finally give feedback on the effect when a slow lands. The messages may not give exact numbers, but they're better than nothing:<p><B>9029 Your spell was mostly successful. <br>9030 Your spell was partially successful. <br>9031 Your spell was slightly successful. <br>9032 Your spell may have had the opposite effect of what you desired.</B><p>Some shamans are a <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9679">tad dismayed</a> by these messages, especially the last one. Seems that some mobs can actually be <I>hasted</I> by casters attempting to slow them. That's a nasty little surprise.<p>Like all things in the game, players will just have to adapt to this. As long as people remember which mobs get hasted by slows--assuming it's consistent and not a random thing--this won't be a massive change. It's certainly not the death of shamans, who are still a vital and versatile class... even if they don't always believe it themselves.<p><BIG>DX9-teenth Nervous Breakdown</BIG><p>Scott &quot;Skippy&quot; Hartsman dropped some info on Dev Corner <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53572">concerning Microsoft's new DirectX 9</a> and how it will affect EQ users:<p><B>Our Testing Department began running a full compatibility run on EverQuest with DirectX 9 before the holidays and recently finished the first pass.<p>There really isn't any compelling reason to upgrade to it right now, since neither EQ nor many video drivers makes use of any DirectX 9 specific features.</B><p>Hartsman goes on to list the hardware configurations used by SOE in their testing procedures. It's a pretty nice assortment of machines--imagine all the bots you could run!<p>Anyway, DX9 isn't going to impact EQ players because the game isn't written to take advantage of it. Software that is--and we'd assume EQ2 will fall into this category--should benefit greatly. And DX9 is going to be needed to really take advantage of AGP 8X video cards.<p>As the Joker is wont to say, &quot;Think about the future.&quot;<p><BIG>Wu Are You?</BIG><p>Monks went on a major whinefest yesterday when their Technique of Master Wu planar skill was fixed. The ability, which granted a chance of allowing monks to score multiple special attacks per round, was working 100% of the time even with only two points spent in the skill, thus increasing DPS a disproportionate amount. Yesterday's patch corrected that mistake, but it didn't stop monks from breaking out the sackcloth and ashes over what a poor, underprivileged class they are.<p>What many haven't realized yet is that, in addition to fixing the skill, it was also <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=35903.topic">upgraded</a>. The description of the skill used to promise a 10% chance of extra special attacks per level, but now it has been changed to 20%. This means that monks can attain the same level of performance that they could from the bugged version, as long as they spend the extra points to raise the ability to level five.<p>Monks are supposed to be damage dealers, and this is the one unique damage increasing AA that monks have. While it isn't in the league of archery disciplines, any boost to damage is appreciated.<p>Where do you buy that sackcloth armor, anyway?
