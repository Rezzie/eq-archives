Well, it's becoming pretty clear just what that message is talking about.<p>The folks in <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fringofvalor44669frm33">Ring of Valor</a> over on Bristlebane have become the first guild to legitimately <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fringofvalor44669frm33.showMessage?topicID=128.topic">kill</a> what might have been the last living ubermob outside of Vex Thal--a big scary dude named Tashakhi (with an apparently unique model, no less). Tashakhi makes his home deep in the caverns of Acrylia, home to those dirty hippies known as Grimlings.<p>Since he/she/it is a denizen of Luclin, of course, you can't just stroll into Acrylia and lay the smack down on Tashakhi. Nope, you have to do a long, involved key quest, which includes a triggered war that is fairly tricky to complete. Oh, and that's just for the key to his general area--<I>one</I> key, which means you have to do the quest 50 times or so to get your guild in there. After that, you have to go through a whole bunch of triggered Ring of Fire-like events to make your way to the boss himself.<p>Which seems to be the trend in Luclin. Seru and the Emperor in Ssra Temple both require months of work to get to, and Vex Thal takes even more time on top of that. All in all, that's not even so bad, really, since Seru and the Emp put out the phat lewtz in spades, and Vex Thal promises to do the same. So it could be argued that, despite having the appearance of being nothing more than massive time sinks designed to keep uberguilds occupied until another expansion can be rolled out, at least these key quests eventually result in a profit.<p>That's what Ring of Valor expected, too. But if you look at what they received, <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11059.topic">many would agree</a> that this guild got the shaft. The items are decent, but hardly of the scale that would make anyone forget NToV anytime soon--which is what, after all, the designer of inner Acrylia initially promised.<p>Don't despair too much, though. Verant has, for a while now, adopted a policy of loading uberzones with marginal loot that can be upgraded later. This came about following the massive backlash after many Kunark items needed to be nerfed due to being foolishly overpowered--moss covered twig, anyone? It seems fairly likely that Tashakhi's loot will see some upgrades. If not, don't expect to see anyone else exploring inner Acrylia... ever. You see, players cling to the idea of risk vs. reward just as tightly as Verant does.<p>Say it with me, now: Veeshan's Peak. There, I think we all feel a little better.<p><BIG>Song Sung Blue</BIG><p>We at Mobhunter have a habit of picking on bards sometimes. Hey, with those wacky instrument animations, gaudy armor colors, and all that prancing about, they're pretty much asking for trouble. In our defense, Kohath did make a bard to try to understand the class better, but I think his nearly complete lack of hand-eye coordination hindered those efforts considerably. So we continue to be a little harsh on the bards.<p>And we're not alone, it would seem. Thott, leader of the uberguild called <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">Afterlife</a>, has completed yet another of his generally well-written essays on EverQuest. This one, cheekily titled <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/retune.php">Bard Retune</a>, provides a list of flaws and weaknesses in the bard class which are at best oversights and at worst outright insults. Many compelling arguments are made, and it's clear that some long-standing bugs need to be fixed in a very bad way. <p><a href="http://pub105.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessageRange?topicID=13914.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=25">Discussion</a> about the article over on the bard board ranges from complete support for the paper to a few voices of disagreement--some citing that the tone is overly negative or whiney. Personally, I didn't think there was any real whining going on (certainly not compared to those massive petitions compiled by certain other classes), and I thought most of the points were made fairly objectively.<p>My problem with the paper, I guess, stems from my belief that if all these proposed upgrades were made, bards would be <I>the</I> uberclass--something Thott himself says he doesn't want. He provides graphs that compare the relative power of bards to wizards, druids, clerics, and paladins, and discusses mez abilities vs. those of the enchanter. I think it's worth noting that bards must be compared to so many other classes to even begin to understand their role in the game.<p>Currently, bards are desired both in exp groups and on raids, and even with all the FT items in the world, it isn't as if casters are telling bards to turn off manasong. So how do you balance a class that solos incredibly well, is loved by exp groups, and provides crucial resist/attack/mana &amp; HP regen on raids? If you upgrade their damage via songs or via melee, does that throw the class completely out of whack?<p>I don't know. Verant probably doesn't either. In fact, we clipped the following ad out of the classifieds in the San Diego paper:<p><H6>WANTED: FT game designer for successful online gaming company. Full health/dental, 401K, profit sharing. Competitive salary. Must be able to balance bard class.</H6><p>This particular ad has been running for two-and-a-half years.<p>I find the assertion that bards are a pulling class to be a bit suspect. The notion of a &quot;pullling class&quot; seems entirely situational to me. I've worked with great bard pullers, but I've seen just about any class be able to do it well under the appropriate conditions--even warriors can do it sometimes. Successful pulling is much more defined by the player than by the class, really. Of course, monks are something of a target in Thott's paper, so I'm probably not as objective as I should be on this subject. (I'd argue that FD classes <I>are</I> crowd control classes, in terms of what crowd we bring rather than what we can do when it gets there. But that's a debate for another time.)<p>As far as tuning bards goes, I think finally and really fixing all the bugs outlined in this paper is a good place to start. After that, compare the damage output and utility of bards again, and see what upgrades are actually needed, if any--throw in a movement speed upgrade for good measure, too.<p>Whatever you want to say about bards, they are a complex class that can do a little of everything. Tuning a one-dimensional class is easy, but bards present multiple challenges. Still, Verant has had plenty of time to work on it, and deserves some nudging to at least get those bugs out of the way.<p>Oh, and maybe not breaking them every other patch would be nice, too.<p><BIG>The Thing That Killed the Radio Star</BIG><p>We mentioned the other day that the video card market was due to heat up, and, as suspected, Matrox has re-entered the fray with an impressive card indeed. Initial looks at the <a href="http://www.gamersdepot.com/hardware/video_cards/matrox/parhelia_release/001.htm">Parhelia</a> reveal not only faster anti-aliasing and improved memory architecture, but a very cool feature called <a href="http://www.gamersdepot.com/hardware/video_cards/matrox/parhelia_release/007.htm">Surround Gaming</a> (if you don't read the rest of the preview, just look at that page). Basically, you can hook up three monitors and get an Imax-like effect of panoramic video. Imagine running around in EQ2's new Befallen with a video setup like that... wow!<p>It's too early to tell whether you should be scrapping your GeForce 4 for a Parhelia (stupid name, btw), but it's certainly worth keeping an eye on this one.
