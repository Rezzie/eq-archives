Well, I was thinking, if there's an interest, of doing something similar here as well.<p>How it works is this: people send in emails, asking me questions. I sift through them, pick out a few every week or so, and then answer them. I was thinking of doing both columns, in that different people read that site as well as this one (although I'm sure there's overlap).<p>I am more interested in answering certain questions than others, though. In other words, I have neither the time nor the inclination to compete with Absor  I'm not looking for EverQuest current event questions, or why a certain item was changed or has certain stats, or whether a quest works or not, or why was 'taunt' changed recently, or to engage in a big debate over the precise rule set of Sullon Zek vs. Tallon Zek.<p>That's what this board in general is for, and we already have a working feedback loop in place.<p>Rather, I'd be interested in answering more broad questions. Questions about game design in general, or why certain decisions were made in creating EverQuest. Or even questions about some of our other announced products, and how they might be similar or different to EverQuest. Or questions about our company in general, our philosophies, what we do every day, how games are developed... or even, 'Brad, who the heck are you anyway?'<p>Now, I'm not at all certain how many people are interested in this sort of thing, but heck, let's give it a try. Send your emails directly to me, but make sure they have ASK BRAD in the beginning of the subject, or they'll slip through my email filter. Then every week or so I'll reply to as many as I can with a public post in this forum (btw, when you send an email in, if you don't want your name shown, please make sure you let me know).<p>And please try to adhere to the themes and topics I've described. I'll have to ignore everything else (and, of course, that includes flames and the like - please be nice to me  ). <p>My email: <a href="mailto:bmcquaid@station.sony.com">bmcquaid@station.sony.com</a><p>-Brad McQuaid<br>Executive Producer, EverQuest<br>Vice President, Premium Games<br>Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive<p>
