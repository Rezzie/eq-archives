To quote:<p><I>After two months of battle, we finally managed to take down the ruler of the Claws of Veeshan, Vulak'Aerr. Congratulations to FoH and Cestus Dei for putting in so much time and effort to see this goal realized. <p>The actual fight with this beast lasted over 14 mins and took an INCREDIBLE force to complete. Don't ask me what that means, just know that the amount of firepower we dumped in him would have killed Statue of Zek four times over....</I><p>The loot is, frankly, insane. INSANE, I tell you!<p><img src=" http://www.linkdead.com/~bwhite/kaoavulak.jpg"><p>Uhhhhh...<p><img src=" http://www.linkdead.com/~bwhite/mdobvulak.jpg"><p>Oooooo... <p><img src=" http://www.linkdead.com/~bwhite/fcovvulak.jpg"><p>Bllvwalamrrrr... (/em drools and babbles)<p>Remember how Kunark came out and suddenly players and items were just so much more powerful than in the original game? Remember when Velious came out and it seemed at first that items were only increasing in effectiveness by a small margin?<p>Well, throw the curve out the window, students, because there is not just a gap between good items and awesome items, there's a freaking canyon.<p>In other uber news, someone calculated what the <a href="http://faerdal.homestead.com/files/IdealMonkItems.htm">ultimate monk</a> in the very best gear would look like. Talk about scary... this guy would out-tank 95% of the warriors you'll ever meet--if he existed, that is.<p>Drooling over uber items is half the fun of playing EverQuest. Me, I'm just trying to figure out how to hack the accounts of the FoH guys...
