You can <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Vl3zxmvxXTM&amp;offerid=13850.209015&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" >preorder</a><IMG border=0 width=1 height=1 src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=Vl3zxmvxXTM&amp;bids=13850&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" > it if you like.<p>How will DAoC affect EverQuest's stranglehold on the market? Tough to say at this point. While many people enjoyed Beta 3 for a while, comments went something like this: great graphics, improved interface, zero content. Judging content from a beta is unfair, I grant you. Beta 4 is about to start, so one would assume that the game will see a huge addition of lands, cities, and quests. But with only six weeks until release, you can expect a buggy, incomplete product to hit the shelves.<p>You heard it here first (I think). While trying to be all things Verant is not, Mythic will find itself in the same spot every other MMORPG has occupied upon release.<p>One potential up-side awaits the EQ faithful. If you remember back to when Ultima Online 2 seemed immanent, Verant released a whole bunch of interface upgrades for EverQuest. Now, you can call that coincidence if you want to, but Verant knows very well that they have some tough competition to keep at bay. Expect to see some additional freebies coming across your patch message in the months ahead.<p><B>No Love for France</B><p>The promised FanFaire in Paris has been <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/en/sorry.jsp">postponed</a>. No reason was given on the EQ site, which leaves some room for speculation.<p>The obvious guess was that attendance was looking poor. However, I find this scenario unlikely. EQ is huge in Europe, and this would be the first chance for a lot of those players to meet the Verant staff. A more likely scenario, in my opinion, is that the Verant staff can't spare the time to make an excursion to Europe right now. With Shadows of Luclin promised for December--and the renewed threat of competition--Verant is probably hesitant to commit the huge resources necessary to pull off a FanFaire on a totally different continent.<p>If the postponement of a FanFaire means a slightly more stable Luclin release, then I'm all in favor of making the Europeans wait. After all, they have <a href="http://www.eurodisney.com/">other amusements</a> to occupy their time.<p><B>Fippy Says &quot;You Suck&quot;</B><p>Another edition of <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/featured_content/fippyfacts/index.jsp">Fippy's Facts</a> has hit the Net. This time, the bane of the Qeynos newbie zone gives us the breakdown of how many people play each available race.<p>Surprisingly, humans dominate with 17.3% of the market. Dark elves are second with 11.1%, followed by wood elves with 10.9%. High elves and half elves are next, but each has only single-digit popularity. Iksars, barbarians, Erudites, dwarves, gnomes, halflings, and ogres follow, with trolls--as always--bringing up the rear with a mere 3.5%.<p>The male/female ratio for each race is also listed. This ranges from a 62.7/37.3 high for wood elves (surprise surprise) to an 89.6/10.4 low for dwarves. I guess bearded women have as challenging a time in EQ as they do in <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_137749.html">real life</a>.<p>Overall, less than a third of all EverQuest characters are female. What Fippy can't tell us, of course, is how many of those &quot;females&quot; possess the same set of chromosomes in real life. As ever, cyber with care.<p><B>Server Populations on a Need-to-Know Basis</B><p>Lum the Mad <a href="http://lumthemad.net/story.php?story=2255">reports</a> that a change to the server select screen has been made on Test server. Instead of listing populations, servers now only reveal whether they are up or down. Further, an unnamed source reports that Ester the Tester came into a chat room and said that the &quot;/who all count&quot; command will be disabled, too.<p>Why make such a change more than two years after EverQuest's release? Perhaps Sony decided they don't want any kind of subscriber information in the public eye. Or maybe Verant decided that it's unnecessary information that confuses new subscribers.<p>Or maybe, just maybe, someone in the company is legitimately concerned that player numbers will take a huge hit when there is another real 3D fantasy roleplaying game in the online marketplace (see DAoC newbit, above). Maybe Sony/Verant doesn't want its users saying to themselves, &quot;Hmm, there used to be 2300 players online at this time, now there's 1700. Maybe I should check out that new game, too.&quot;<p>Could this be why <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/">EQ Vault's</a> server population list is broken?<p>We're betting that the gears of Absor's spin-control machine are busy cranking away even as you read this. Then again, such a change might be made and we could see no official comment for weeks. It's happened before...
