First I&apos;d like to say I really would love to hear answers to Aarkan and Chark&apos;s questions.  The &quot;redo&quot; of the AA exp system was the #1 reason as a solo&apos;ist why I finally called it quits, Quickly followed by the realization that with more and more expansions each with at least some &quot;flagging&quot;, I was paying for content with a zero sum change of ever seeing it regardless of any personal ability to survive inside t</description>

<description>Are there plans to make the pets meaningful again? Not as a substitute for warriors, of course, but allow some meaningful soloing?

Will there be a pet inspect window? Where we could replace fire/cold/magic based weapons as necessary without making a new pet? 

Will there be a /pet swap command to exchange the &quot;pocketed&quot; pet with the active one?

<description>In the past two expansions, poor and/or unfinished itemization has been an undeniable problem.  Has Merloc been given added manpower to work on itemization for this expansion and will said itemization undergo multiple rounds of feedback and change from beta testers, to try and weed out some of the usual obvious issues?</description>

<description>Keep the questions coming! I will be sending them to SOE on Thursday so get them in soonest. If not I&apos;m filling it with nothing but sloppy fanboi questions like &quot;how cool was it to work on?&quot; and &quot;How much ass does the Sleeper kick?&quot;

Don&apos;t let that happen. Post away.</description>

<description>We were told that the new human models have been shelved, but that a different race is now being worked on, and that race&apos;s new models might be seen sometime around the launch of SoF.  Is this still the case, and when can we start seeing screens to offer feedback?  (And, are you still building everything off of the drakkin model, or has the reaction to the horrible human models changed your approach in that regard?)</description>

<description>Who cut Absor&apos;s hair?

Seriously, per my previous question, if they&apos;re not going to revamp the playermodels, can they at least comment on redesigning or adding new graphics for armor and weapons?  The displayed graphics for armor for example are much too limited.  How great would it be to actually have players look different from each other not just based upon color selection?

My warrior doesn&apos;t wear crafted armor any more but you</description>

<description>How does SOE rank classes in their current state in terms of DPS and tanking, (it&apos;d be great to get an actual ordered list for both), how much does this differ from the way they think the classes SHOULD be ranked, and what is being done in SoF to effect the necessary changes, (if any)?</description>

<description>Hopefully this is in time...

Quick preface:  I played EQ for 6 years, and played hardcore.  My account expired in April, and I parted ways with EQ, but it was an amicable parting of the ways.  I am not one of those bitter ex-players, explaining at length why EQ sucks.  I don&apos;t think it does suck, and if it may have moved in a direction I did not like, I can still understand some of that reason.  I think the devs do increbile things, conside</description>
