Isn't that pure fun? Especially when you want to see that fancy new compass Verant promised you in the patch message.<p>The reason people were crashing was due to changes made to the new user interface. Despite the waves of people complaining about such changes (and believe me, I did my share of cursing yesterday), the UI is, technically, still in testing. One hopes that changes made don't completely break our ability to play, of course, but I guess it's the luck of the draw until the UI is declared to be done.<p>Anyway, Absor posted a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000652.html">guide</a> to help folks get up and running again. The Reader's Digest version of it is:<p>1. Make sure your custom UI folder contains only the files that are necessary. To do this, create a new folder. Then figure out which custom windows you will use and copy those .xml files (and any associated graphics files) into the new folder. When you can actually get into the game, /loadskin that new folder and make sure everything works as intended. If it does, you should have less hassles with patches in the future.<p>2. To actually get into the game, you need to edit all your UI_charname_XX.ini files and change the UISkin line to say &quot;Default&quot; instead of your custom folder name. You'd need to do this for all your characters. Alternately, you could just delete those files--either way works.<p>That second step was key; I couldn't get into the game without it. Also, check <a href="http://newui.technosapien.net/index.htm">EQ Interface</a> and its forums for updated versions of whatever mod you were using. (Note: While that site is terrific, they need to update their directions for making a custom UI folder. They still say to make a copy of the default folder and unzip changes into it, which isn't the right way to do it anymore. Start with a fresh folder and <I>only</I> unzip changes into it.)<p>After much fiddling I was able to get things working okay yesterday. The patch was still a big hassle, but at least most folks were able to play... eventually.<p><BIG>The Key Point Here</BIG><p>Key rings went in with yesterday's patch as a means of no longer needing to carry soulbound keys to certain dungeons. It's a great idea that many people have wanted for a long, long time.<p>However, those of us wary of destroying our keys after adding them to our rings were vindicated as <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000654.html">Absor</a> and several in-game GM broadcasts warned people: <B>do not delete your keys.</B> There's some problem that needs fixing, yada yada yada, so don't destroy them.<p><BIG>Speaking of Keys...</BIG><p>A <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=5478.topic">new face</a> turned up outside of Sleeper's Tomb after the patch. His name is Nelef the Trader, and he's asking about prismatic scales. You might remember that these ultra-rare scales drop after the Sleeper is awakened, and can be turned in to a dragon named Melalafen in Western Wastes who will give you various rewards. Trouble is, Mel also wants your hard-earned ST key before he gives up the goods.<p>That's where Nelef comes in. He offers to examine the reward Mel gave you and return it to you along with a replacement key to the Tomb.<p>Why do this? Because Verant wants you to see the revamped Sleeper's Tomb when it goes live, I suppose. It's a nice gesture, and those who happen upon a scale no longer need to ponder the value of giving up their ST key.<p>As far as other post-patch changes go, there are also reports that <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11790.topic">Befallen</a> was changed again, maybe for good this time. Might be worth a look-see.<p><BIG>Because They Want to, That's Why</BIG><p>Patch fans will be pleased to know that Verant has already <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000655.html">announced</a> the date of the next one:<p><B>On Wednesday, August 21st, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 3 hours.</B><p>Hopefully this will tune performance a bit, as well as clean up the key ring bug and other UI issues. Was I the only one who noticed graphics were a little extra laggy last night? Maybe they had to de-optimize something to disable those UI exploits that have been running rampant.<p>Enough babble. Back to UI tweaking I go.
