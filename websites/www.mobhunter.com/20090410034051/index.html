				<h2><a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=466" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Spam: the New Poetry">Spam: the New Poetry</a></h2>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Have you ever actually browsed your junk email folder? Sure, there&#8217;s nasty virus-laden stuff you need to watch out for, but some spammers are including a wealth of inspired writing in their messages that a student of modern poetry can&#8217;t help but find captivating.</p>
<p>Check out this gem, found in a message entitled &#8220;Restore your organs ability and productivity now&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>but let me tell you thats not how it will really go i imagine most kids will want to stay home and play computer games but their moms will make them come and so theyll grudgingly put on a some church pants and skirts so i was wondering if you could help me know how to bring the romance back into our modern life its not really that important no matter the dress or the menu we just want the kids to come to feel the spirit of the temple but its like you said anne when you dont use your imagination to make life beautiful how much you miss what an adventure it is</p></blockquote>
<p>Marvelous! This passage has a stream-of-consciousness quality to it that I admire. I knew many would-be poets at university who had no hope of matching such majesty.</p>
<p>Later in the same email, the author shifts focus to a new subject framed in the context of modern life:</p>
<blockquote><p>breakfast i always have two eggs and salsa always i dont really get sick of it and it would really stink if i did because theres not a lot out there for breakfast actually when you are at your ideal weight and ovulating regularly you can have any kind of whole grain hot cereal without a problem you know steel cut oats etc i am not quite there yet berries and grapes are pretty low on the glycemic index and i have those too oh and i love cottage cheese with fruit grant and i listened and danced to his music on valentines day</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascinating! As an audience, we are enthralled by the narrator&#8217;s candor on her eating and ovulation habits. Yet it is the hint of romance at the end of the passage which truly captivates us, leaving us to wonder as to the identity of &#8220;grant&#8221; and the mysterious composer of the music to which our protagonist danced.</p>
<p>This modern epic draws to a close with yet another slice-of-life observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>do you have to be obsessed with yarn and needles and hooks like i am to think that is the most inviting little space youve ever seen when cate is too scared to go downstairs penny will go with her and everything is all right she lets cate dress her up for weddings or try to ride her or pull her by the tail almost daily and even knowing the torture she will soon endure she gets so excited when cate gets home from school</p></blockquote>
<p>Using yarn and needles as metaphors for our fear of institutions such as weddings and school is beyond brilliant. You&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find social commentary of this caliber among today&#8217;s published so-called poets.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll realize that a wealth of reading wonder awaits in your junk folder. It is perhaps the ultimate irony that beauty and thought of this quality is being relegated to the trash bins of modern culture. The future of our society is alive and well, not within the cold walls of the classroom, but inside the nurturing womb of the spam filter.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Lum posted articles about two GDC talks, one by <a title="A force of nature" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/03/26/barnett-does-gdc-gdc-survives-the-experience/" target="_blank">Mythic&#8217;s Paul Barnett</a> and the other by <a title="He really did write the worst quest ever" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/03/27/jeff-kaplan-does-gdc-explains-how-not-to-write-quests/" target="_blank">Blizzard&#8217;s Jeff Kaplan</a>. While the articles themselves are interesting, I found the comments sections even more enlightening.</p>
<p>In the former, you have a number of commenters saying what a blowhard Paul is, some of them implying that WAR&#8217;s subscriber numbers are an indicator that Mr. B doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>In the latter, you have a number of commenters saying what a blowhard Jeff is, some of them implying that despite WoW&#8217;s success it&#8217;s clear that Mr. K doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>Which to me is yet another amusing example of Why Devs Can&#8217;t Possibly Win. Because if you fall below some community-perceived bar of success then you are a clueless failure, and if you&#8217;re above that bar you&#8217;re out of touch and too afraid of losing profit to innovate.</p>
<p>Despite the occasional exaggeration or bluster, neither of these guys is trying to put himself atop a mountain proclaiming he has the answer to the mysteries of the universe. Ultimately, they state their opinions and observations in public forums because people ask them to. As attending or reading such presentations is an entirely optional undertaking, I find it odd that some folks seem to get angry that these guys are even allowed to speak.</p>
<p>From the <a title="Raph will think it's funny I call him mighty" href="http://www.raphkoster.com/" target="_blank">mighty</a> <a title="I could also have said &quot;blowhards&quot;" href="http://terranova.blogs.com/" target="_blank">intellectuals</a> to the <a title="The lowest of the low" href="http://www.mobhunter.com/" target="_blank">lowly bloggers</a>, we&#8217;re all just trying to inspire discussion about what works and what doesn&#8217;t so that those of us lucky enough to work in the industry can keep doing this for a living and hopefully get better at our craft. If there&#8217;s any value to be had in GDC and its ilk, it&#8217;s that. Sometimes you just have to look past a lot of bullshit to find it.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Okay, it&#8217;s not technically <em>my </em>book per se, but I did coauthor a chapter with my old (and I do mean <em>old</em>) comrade, Tracy &#8220;Owlchick&#8221; Seamster. The book is called <em>Writing for Video Game Genres: From FPS to RPG</em>, and its contributors come from the Writers SIG of the IGDA. Our chapter is, as you might guess, about writing for MMOGs. The rest of the book covers pretty much any type of video game you can imagine.</p>
<p>Obviously the focus is on writing, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about me jamming a bunch of opinionated design theories down your throat (after all, you get those for free on this blog). If for some reason you find this book appealing, you can pad my wallet with a hefty .002 cents per copy royalty by ordering the book directly <a title="Shameless plug." href="http://www.akpeters.com/product.asp?ProdCode=4179" target="_blank">from the publisher</a>, <a title="No shame at all." href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Video-Game-Genres-FPS/dp/1568814178/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1238125481&amp;sr=1-7" target="_blank">via Amazon</a>, or <a title="Seriously, I need money." href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Writing-for-Video-Game-Genres/Wendy-Despain/e/9781568814179/?itm=1" target="_blank">from Barnes &amp; Noble</a>. Word is it may even show up in your local bookstore at some point.</p>
<p>Let me warn you ahead of time that I had to hold back a bit on some of the details I would have otherwise included had my current project been on the shelves already (have to protect the secret sauce, you know), but I think the stuff Tracy and I put together is nonetheless useful for anyone thinking of becoming a writer for an MMOG.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m most proud of the fact that I now have something tangible to show my mom to explain what I do for a living. Video games she doesn&#8217;t get, but a book she will understand.</p>

					<p>Ten years ago today, a game launched that would have a huge impact on my life in more ways that I can count. It was a big, beautiful, maddeningly imperfect game that would become an obsession. But more than anything, it gave me countless hours of fun.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has been a part of the franchise over the last decade and more. Being a small part of the magic has been one of the great honors of my life.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>On RPG Vault, FusionFall&#8217;s Rich Weil outlines a lot of the reasons <a title="or should I say wishy washy" href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/962/962114p1.html" target="_blank">community management is a much more nebulous position</a> in online gaming than many other development roles. <a title="Talks more about community than most community managers" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/03/13/warcraft-killed-the-community-star/" target="_blank">Lum</a> (honorary community manager) and <a title="Likes to use the word &quot;weenies&quot;" href="http://eatingbees.brokentoys.org/2009/03/13/go-read-this-well-talk-about-afterwards/" target="_blank">Sanya</a> discuss the article and agree with most of what Rich says, and there&#8217;s not much in the piece that I would argue about either.</p>
<p>But I think there&#8217;s more to this general misunderstanding about community management than a lack of metrics or solid job descriptions. The profession also lacks a sense of history.</p>
<p>If you want to judge a designer, artist, or coder on a game he or she has worked on, you can (usually) pick up the game and evaluate it for yourself, or at the very least do some digging into reviews and feedback on the particular aspects of the game linked to this person&#8217;s efforts. To evaluate the work of a community manager, what are you going to do&#8211;dig through years of forum posts? Search out fansite interviews? Google for vague impressions?</p>
<p>The very nature of community management is that it&#8217;s <em>of the moment</em>. These moments have a cumulative effect for members of the community&#8211;they either develop a sense that the community team is listening and actively working on their behalf or decide they&#8217;re useless corporate shills&#8211;but beyond the realm of the player base and dev team, the community manager has a hard time making a clear impression. Unless you were a member of the relevant community at the time, there is little chance you&#8217;ll know anything more than third-hand rumors about what Abashi did to piss off players, or what Sanya did to make the Camelot Herald kick ass, or what Moorgard did or didn&#8217;t say about frogloks. You can read random insinuations posted on message boards by those who may or may not have been there, but often those recollections are made through the hazy veil of selective memory.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re talking about a profession that not only lacks standardized tools, job descriptions, and advancement opportunities (is there a pure community job in gaming anywhere above the director level?), but where new generations of community managers can barely get a sense of what their predecessors have done right or wrong.</p>
<p>Sure, I suppose if someone comes up with a formula for measuring exactly how a community manager&#8217;s efforts impact specific aspects of a particular product, those metrics would help justify the position to those who doubt its value, but we&#8217;ll never entirely get away from the fact that OCR is indeed a touchy-feely affair (as it should be; if it ain&#8217;t touchy-feely, it ain&#8217;t community). Personally, as much as I&#8217;d like to see the next generation of community managers armed with proper standards and metrics, I&#8217;d just as much like to see them endowed with a real sense of what went before so that they can help guide this discipline to a better future.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure whether listening to certain bands affects your scores or whether people of a certain score range share similar music tastes, but I don&#8217;t think this project is all that scientific anyway. Regardless, it&#8217;s a pretty sure bet you can use something on this chart to point out to a buddy how dumb he is.</p>

					<p>I hate saying it as much as you hate me for saying it, but it&#8217;s true. In what should be the best of its seasons, Battlestar Galactica&#8217;s final batch of episodes has been mostly dreadful.</p>
