<html><head><title>A Whole Lotta Ham</title></head><body><h1>A Whole Lotta Ham</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-09-19</p><BIG>300 Flavors</BIG><p>As if you didn't know already, Test server was recently spammed with about <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2002-09-18%2012:28:36">300 new and modified spells</a> for the Planes of Power expansion that is now little more than a month away. Casters Realm is compiling a nicely organized <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/pop.asp">list</a>, but you can also check class boards for spells and reactions to them from <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=af237b69a478c69f3217ac126aa80736&amp;threadid=5569">shamans</a>, <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=28746.topic">druids</a>, <a href="http://pub105.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=15085.topic">bards</a>, <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=8561">necros</a>, and <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=2ba0b1b15f55ae31bfb16732fdc9c3b9&amp;threadid=11980">clerics</a>, among others.<p>Some classes (like druids) seem to be pretty happy with the new spells, while others (like shamans) feel let down because they don't see much innovation. There is a bit of complaining that the new spells are often just expanded versions of ones that already exist, with higher stat bonuses, more healing, higher resist boosts, etc.<p>Frankly, it's not that surprising. There really haven't been many fresh spell ideas since Kunark was released. Why? Because there's only so far Verant can go without blurring the lines between classes or introducing abilities that break the game completely. Sure, new ideas for spells abound on the class boards, but not all of them are what most players would consider realistic. In the same way that AA abilities in Shadows of Luclin made melees do the same things they had been doing just a bit better, the new PoP spells allow casters to improve on the abilities they already have. In some cases that isn't glamorous or exciting, but it's advancement nonetheless.<p>Right now, one of the more interesting debates is whether the level 64 cleric spell Word of Reviviscence is a group heal or a group resurrection. If it turns out to be the latter, a mass group buff rez would speed up recovery from failed raids immensely. It would also be a fun way to get a bunch of naked people killed a second time if the big nasty mobs are still hovering around camping corpses.<p>Sorry. Sometimes my sadism is difficult to contain.<p><BIG>To Serve Man</BIG><p>As we reported yesterday, there has been a storm of controversy surrounding recent posts made by people claiming to be current or former members of the guide program (my inbox has been similarly flooded). Charges of ineptitude and maliciousness abound, and a common theme is that Verant intends to eliminate even basic customer service as part of your monthly subscription fee.<p>The uproar seems to have been big enough to <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=51760">elicit a response</a> from SOE's Alan Crosby, also known as Head GM Brenlo:<p><B>Rest assured that there is no plan to institute a &quot;pay for Customer Service&quot; model. We have a large staff of over 70 GMs and Supervisors for EverQuest alone and plan to continue with the same level of Customer Support, as part of the purchase price for all of our soon to be released titles. <p>Customer service will always be an integral part of SOE's products and while we may not respond to every issue as rapidly as we would like, we do try to resolve them all in time. If you find that your issue has not been responded to, please use the Contact a GM link on the EverQuest board. These emails are generally responded to within 48 hours thanks to the diligence of our Email GMs. In addition, while GMs are available in limited numbers 24 hours a day, you may have the best chance of contact during peak usage hours which are from 5PM to 8PM PST as this is when most GMs are available.</B><p>Who is telling the truth? Time will tell, I guess. But as one of my minions pointed out on our message board, the pragmatic approach to needing less customer service is to make <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=150111588&amp;msgid=-1138749005#message">a more stable game</a>. Having less bugs along with more content that works correctly and makes sense is the best route to minimizing the need for customer service. Will that ideal ever happen? Of course not. But it's certainly something to shoot for.<p><BIG>You Want Fries with That?</BIG><p>All that boring twinking and skill work got you down? Then why not buy a pre-made character? No, stupid, I don't mean from eBay or those other player auction sites--I mean from the makers of the game.<p>Fortunatly, I don't mean SOE. Slashdot is <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/19/0334258&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=98">reporting</a> that Origin has decided to try this service with Ultima Online. That's right, you can now <a href="http://support.uo.com/advancedcharacter.html">buy relatively well-developed characters</a> for a mere $29.95.<p>Most UO players are <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/php-bin/uo/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Board=uouhall&amp;Number=3323534&amp;page=0&amp;view=&amp;sb=5">pissed</a>, as you'd imagine. The uproar rivals the screaming heard when Legends was first announced in EQ.<p>Would Verant ever try such a thing? You can be sure that the money people at Sony will be paying attention, and if the program is a runaway success in UO... who knows. But let us hope and pray that the idea is as much of a dismal failure as it deserves to be, and residents of Norrath can go about twinking our alts the old-fashioned way.<p>Incidentally, the irony in the statement above is intentional.<p>By the way, the folks at MMOGNews are holding a little <a href="http://www.mmognews.com/article.php?sid=47">contest</a> in which they give away one of these fine Advanced Character accounts! Hmmm, I wonder if I'm eligible...<p><BIG>Another Excuse for a Cookout</BIG><p>In case you weren't aware, September 18 is a Norrathian holiday--<a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=32127.topic">Jade Mace Day</a>. It is fitting that this day is set aside to honor that sturdy old Kunark weapon, as 9/18 is the mace's damage/delay ratio.<p>Jade Mace Day joins other holidays that honor weapons, such as Ykesha Day (8/24), Combine Short Sword Day (4/23), and Mosscovered Twig Day (3/10). There is a movement to add a thirteenth month to the calendar so that we could celebrate Primal Warsword Day (13/20), but it is unknown at this time whether Congress will pass this bill into law.<p>Keep those cards and letters coming.
