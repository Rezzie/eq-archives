A quick example of the bug: warrior gets low on hit points, warrior is completely healed, warrior gets &quot;you died&quot; message, warrior does some more damage to mob, warrior gets smaller heals, warrior is hit, warrior gets another &quot;you died&quot; message. According to Alan, there is a workaround in lieu of an actual patch:<p><B>There have been some questions about spell damage and spell healing not taking effect properly, things like a player seeing a) multiple death messages, b) &quot;you died&quot; when they should have died to an NPC or c) seeing healing messages and then dying from damage that would appear to be less than the amount just healed.<p>It's a bug in the spell filters -- The workaround for this is to turn spell filtering totally off.<p>We're sorry we didn't patch code with the last patch, but we're in the process of updating some of the server architecture, which includes character storage, so we're taking our time on it. We need to make sure everything is working properly before we can patch this stuff, which includes the fix for this particular bug.</B><p>If this trick actually works, we can survive until a proper patch, I guess. It seems an odd solution, though. The bug seems more like a delay between the time the spell thinks it lands and when the hitpoints are actually restored, though I guess some odd filtering problem could be at the heart of it. Maybe having the PC spells filter completely off requires the client to update sooner or something. In any case, we'll soon see, as warriors will no doubt be testing the waters of this &quot;fix&quot; tonight.<p><BIG>WAAAAAAA! I Want My Own Quest! WAAAAAAAA!</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000545.html">answered</a> a player's question as to why non-Iksar shadowknights get to do the Greenmist quests when the Iksar are such unfriendly SOBs:<p><B>These quests are available to all races in much the same way that other quests are available to Iksar, and for pretty much the same reason.<p>In fact, it could easily be argued that non-Iksar doing these quests are putting in far more time and effort than the item earned is worth. If you aren't aware of the faction requirements for these quests, look into them. It takes a LOT of effort for a 'softskin' to earn the right to perform these quests. So much effort that I suspect even the Crusaders would be appeased (in fact, they are, that's what the faction thing is all about).<p>Yes, we'd love to have individual, long-running, super-involved quests for every single race/class/deity combination. Heck, eventually we might reach a point where we have that.<p>But with these quests the character doing the quests has to establish a friendly (well, as friendly as one would expect with the Iksar) rapport with the quest giver, so that basically means that they have proved themselves. It's just like saying that there is no way that the Humans would ever allow an Iksar to use their bank, and yet given the right amount of effort from an Iksar, they do allow it.</B><p>I'd make some crack about how the person asking this question is a selfish baby, but I agree with them at least a little bit. Though I could give a rodent's behind about SK armor or anything having to do with Iksar, I do think having quests that are unique to certain races and deities is a good thing. I mean, should handing in 9,000 bone chips really make Iksar SKs get all chummy with a gnome or a human? You'd think the lazy handbags could just collect their own...<p>Anyway, I'm hoping Planes of Power does have some unique deity-specific quests. I'd hate to see Iksar monks doing quests in the Plane of Tranquility, though I have a sinking feeling I won't be able to escape that. After all, it took a couple years for an Iksar portion of the monk epic quest to surface, and there's only six months until PoP is due.<p><BIG>This Newsbit Has a Recommended Level of -10</BIG><p>Last week Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000545.html">confirmed</a> something we <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=1266135409">already told you</a>--that the recommended level field on some items was not new, and that the fungus covered scale tunic has not, in fact, been nerfed on Test server. However, they aren't ruling out a change in the future:<p><B>We haven't made any decisions about applying the Recommended Level to items like the tunic. But I wanted to let you know that such a change is not impossible, for the tunic or other items with similar affect when twinked.</B><p>There was a big debate on our site as to whether twinking is good or bad--healthy or unhealthy--for the game. What I've decided is that your belief depends entirely upon what kind of EQ player you are:<p>If you look at the game from a <I>roleplaying</I> perspective, twinking is bad, because in theory each <I>character</I> should be earning his own items. Thus, roleplayers will always be against twinking, because it takes away from their immersive experience. <p>From a <I>replayability</I> perspective, twinking is good, because in theory each <I>player</I> earns items that can be distributed among various characters as the owner sees fit. Thus gamers (for lack of a better term) will always be in favor of twinking, because it enhances their enjoyment of the game.<p>Does that solve anything? No. But maybe you'll understand a bit better why people on the other side of the debate just won't budge. Now go hug each other, you two.<p><BIG>It's Called &quot;Responsibility,&quot; Jackass</BIG><p>Last Friday CNET posted <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-881673.html">yet another story</a> that had to do with EverQuest addiction--this time talking to &quot;survivors&quot; who merely let their lives fall into ruin rather than commit suicide. Well, fine. One popular story breeds others like it--that's to be expected in the news business. However, the attitude taken by the story's initial &quot;victim&quot;--Dennis Bennett--makes me sick:<p><B>Bennett, whose family life and grades in school have recovered nicely since he stopped playing the game about a year ago, considers himself a recovered &quot;EverQuest&quot; addict, now able to control his desire to immerse himself in the game's rich fantasy world. <p>&quot;The game almost ruined my life,&quot; said the network engineer in southern Indiana. &quot;It was my life. I ceased being me; I became Madrid, the Great Shaman of the North. Thinking of it now, I almost cringe; it's so sad.&quot;</B><p>Dear Mr. Bennett: you are pathetic. EverQuest didn't ruin your life; you did. Your weakness. Your insecurity. Your lack of common sense. You. You. You. (And by the way, anyone who calls himself &quot;the Great Shaman of the North&quot; is due for an ass whooping in any case.)<p>It's become a cliche of modern culture, but it's so sadly true: people don't want to accept responsibility for anything. Blame TV and movies for an increase in violence in our society. Blame the schools for kids being stupid. Blame a video game for your own lack of self control.<p>The world is full of potentially bad things: cigarettes, booze, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/484/2226064.html">narcotics</a>, guns, violent images, gambling, hurtful words... the list goes on and on. But the fact that these things exist doesn't mean you must abuse them.<p>Even a &quot;good&quot; thing, when taken to an extreme, can become a problem. Having a job is considered a good thing, yet being a workaholic is not. Being in love is a good thing, but obsessing over someone to the point of stalking them is not.<p>EverQuest--and video games in general--would be considered a &quot;good&quot; thing by most people, or at least something that isn't inherently evil. But as with anything else, overindulging can lead to disaster. But that's hardly the fault of Verant, Sony, or the product itself--it's the fault of the person who abuses it.<p>I'm not saying there can't be mitigating factors, including mental illness and the possibility of genes that actually make you more likely to be an addictive personality, but somewhere along the line you have to stand up and take responsibility for the choices you make in life--whether that's playing a video game or sticking a syringe full of heroin in your arm. But people like Dennis Bennett--who would rather blame a video game for the fact that he's a lousy parent and husband than face his own character flaws--aren't likely to do so.<p>Be better than that.
