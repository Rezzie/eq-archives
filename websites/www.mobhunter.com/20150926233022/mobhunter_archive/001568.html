<h1 class="article_title">Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition Review</h1>
<p>by Loral on July 03, 2008</p>

<p>Dungeons and Dragons has been a staple in my nerd pedigree since I was 16 years old. I've played on and off since high school, playing D&D 2nd edition and D&D 3.5. For most of this time I was the dungeon master of the game, putting together adventures, customizing monsters and encounters, and building the story through which the players would all play.</p>

<p>About a year ago I got quite frustrated with D&D 3.5. Our gaming group, a group of adult friends who gathered monthly to play for about four or five hours, had reached level 13. Most of the players ran more than one character, sometimes because another member of the group left and sometimes to fill a role the party missed. During these games every battle took nearly two hours. It got so bad that I had to tune adventures around four, three, and sometimes as few as two combat encounters per adventure simply to ensure we'd leave at a normal time. Modules like "City of the Spider Queen" had to be completely re-written to let our group have any chance at finishing it.</p>

<p>At Gencon 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition and, a year later, I now have the 4th edition Players Handbook, Monster Manual, and Dungeon Master's Guide sitting on my desk.</p>

<p>D&D 4th edition solved many of the problems I have with 3.5. Combat is fast, characters are streamlined but still powerful, I'm able to write and run the adventures I want, and everyone at the table is having a great time.</p>

<p>Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition is the best tabletop RPG I have ever played.</p>

<h2>What makes 4th Edition Great</h2>

<p>There's a lot of great stuff in 4th edition but a few of these stand out as the clear advantages of the system.</p>

<p>First, the rules are simplified and more consistent. For example, attacks against enemies always mean rolling a d20 and adding your modifier. It doesn't matter if you're hitting with a sword or firing a fireball. You always roll attack rolls. This is a big switch from 3.5 where spells required defenders to roll saving throws while fighters rolled attacks against static defender ACs. The four defenses in 4th edition; AC, fortitude, reflex, and will; make sense and feel natural.</p>

<p>Second, all character classes are fun to play. The cleric in 4th edition sure isn't your daddy's cleric. Though healing is still a large part of a cleric's job, the cleric can drop a lot of damage and boost a party's effectiveness quite a bit. This is the first D&D cleric that is genuinely fun to play.</p>

<p>Third, class powers rock. I remember when I first saw feats in D&D 3.5 how I saw them as the evolution of skills. Feats were skills that actually meant something in combat. Now combat powers take that up a step further. Character powers are the true strength in your character. They are the abilities you will use the most often in any given combat. They are the cinematic action-packed moves that impress the rest of the players and make you feel like a real hero instead of a farmer with a sword.</p>

<p>Fourth, character power and monster power is very well balanced. The power curves in D&D is much smoother from level 1 to 30 than it was from 1 to 20 in 3.5. One of the brilliant changes in D&D 4th edition is the monster power levels. Instead of simply having a monster level that compares to a character level, monsters can come in four different types: minions, standard guys, elite guys, and solo guys. Minions may be as powerful statistically as a player at any level but any single successful attack kills them in a single blow. This way a level 23 party may get attacked by twenty level 20 abyssal ghouls but any single hit on any of them will drop them dead. Normal guys are the typical monsters we're used to. Elite guys are powerful versions of normal guys but count as two, have twice the hit points, and often have some sort of secondary attacks. Solo guys, like dragons and beholders, can fight off an entire party by themselves. Again, these can be at any level, so a level 3 solo white dragon still counts as a single solo creatures as does a level 30 solo ancient red dragon. As a DM, these make it a lot easier to build powerful boss creatures surrounded by threatening fodder like a good John Woo movie.</p>

<p>Fourth, and most importantly, 4th edition is simply more fun to play. Players focus on their powers instead of digging into the minutia of the rules. Fighters have a whole pile of actions to perform while wizards are much more streamlined and focused instead of choosing from hundreds of possible options while the rest of the players look bored.</p>

<h2>The Problems of 4E</h2>

<p>D&D 4th edition isn't perfect. For one, since every attack requires an attack roll, players will miss a lot more often than they used to in 3.5. Wizards always had the option to cast a magic missile and do a little damage. Now magic missiles can miss, something unheard of for the last 30 years. When your turn may not come around for ten minutes or so, it's pretty lame to miss your roll and have to wait another ten minutes.</p>

<p>Second, 4th edition is really built around miniatures on a battle grid. While players can possibly play D&D with just dialog and maybe some paper diagrams, most of the rules focus on a square battle grid and miniatures. For the past two years or so I've become hopelessly addicted to D&D miniatures so this isn't a problem for me. It justifies the money I've spent.</p>

<p>Third, character creation is still pretty complicated. Attributes, races, classes, and items all have modifiers to your baseline statistics that require quite a lot of page flipping. For example, to calculate your athletics skill check you have to know your level, your attribute modifier, your possible racial modifier, your class trained skills, and any possible armor modifier. For an experienced player this isn't so bad, and its a LOT better than the overly complicated skill system in 3.5, but it makes it difficult to quickly build characters for a one-night game. I personally can't wait for some sort of online javascript character generator that can help me quickly build PCs for a one-night game. In the mean time, I'm back to using PC-like D&D miniatures for quick games or 1 on 1 games.</p>

<h2>The Fear of Change</h2>

<p>There's a lot of criticism surrounding 4th edition. Amazon currently posts a customer rating of 3 out of 5. Many of the reviewers don't even own the books but simply attack with many various criticisms that generally come down to the following:</p>

<p>1. 4th Edition is too simplified and misses a lot of the stuff I had and liked in 3.5. </p>

<p>2. I already have too much invested in 3.5 and I don't want to switch.</p>

<p>3. 4th Edition is World of Warcraft on paper.</p>

<p>Nearly all of these arguments come down to a single problem; a fear of change.</p>

<p>I don't know how many of the critics are actual Dungeon Masters and I don't know of those who are DMs how many have tried 4th edition, but after reading through and playing through a few D&D 4th edition games, as a DM I can't see ever going back. In my 3.5 games the planning was too complicated, too much time was spent at the table looking up strange rules, and combat took forever. 4th edition gets rid of all of that without losing the tactics and fun that makes a game like D&D great.</p>

<p>I can understand those who feel like their shelf full of 3.5 books suddenly became worthless. However, looking at my own substantial collection of books, I see very few I'd actually give away. Many of them, like the Book of Vile Darkness and the two Fiendish Codices bring me nostalgia even now. Game systems change and there's no one forcing anyone to switch. Everyone knew Wizards would come out with a new version some day and frankly, I'm glad they did.</p>

<p>The "D&D = Warcraft" straw-man argument is perplexing. First, a pen and paper game is never like a computer game. Second, WoW is pretty popular so who cares if it does steal from it. There are elements to D&D that mimic some of the rules of WoW such as the talent trees and some of the character class attributes, but combat is still very much D&D and 4th Edition definitely has its own flavor.</p>

<h2>D&D's Biggest Problem</h2>

<p>There's one large unwritten problem surrounding a game like D&D, one that has nothing to do with the rules or the cost of the books. Sometimes its just hard to find a group with which to play. I've been lucky in my life to have four of five good D&D groups that played for over a few years. I'm very lucky to have two groups now, one a weekly game that I run with my friends and another that I play in every other week. This mostly comes from the location in which I live, there are enough people around the DC area to find a few different groups of folks. For folks living out in the sticks, however, finding a group can be rough.</p>

<p>Add onto this the stigma of being a D&D player, one we often enjoy together but one that gets in the way when we want to find or build a group, and many might toss D&D aside and focus on computer games instead. I know there were times in my life where I really wanted to play D&D but was too shy to really hunt down and find a good group. It takes a lot of guts to invite yourself into a group of a bunch of strangers, especially for socially awkward folks like myself who tend to gravitate towards games like this.</p>

<p>There's no clear solution to this. The internet helps with sites like Meetup.com and various D&D boards where people meet and get together. However, as long as the game isn't mainstream, it will be hard for a lot of people to play.</p>

<p>I can think of only one solution that may help give players the opportunity to play: adventures written for two players. Like D&D miniatures, D&D could be played by two players, one as a DM and one as a player. The player character would have to fight alone but could fight down a series of nasty bad guys and solve a simple plot. I've read enough posts to see a high demand for one-on-one adventures but so far have seen very few ever published. Like soloing in World of Warcraft, one-on-one D&D adventures have a better opportunity to bring D&D to more people. I hope to see this expand in the future.</p>

<p>Until better solutions can be found, D&D will always be a hobbyist game played by a few folks in dark basements scattered across the country.</p>

<h2>4th Edition, My New Favorite Game</h2>

<p>As a DM, 4th edition is a dream. It gives me all the tools to build an exciting adventure that feels like an excellent action movie without worrying about power balance. Combat is fast and fun, with lots of options for both the players and the DMs. The rules are easy enough for veteran players to jump right in with mostly logical conclusions to the questions that come up during gameplay.</p>

<p>As a player, D&D 4th edition makes every class fun, gives enough options and customization to build the sort of character one wants to play without so much customization as to overwhelm. Class powers are the next evolution in character action providing the action-packed actions we'd expect in a good book or movie.</p>

<p>Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition is the best tabletop RPG I've ever played.</p>

<p>Did Robin Laws have a hand in the development?  The combat & monster system sound like they were lifted directly from his mid 90's game, Feng Shui.</p>

<p>Having played D&D since the white boxed set, I don't want to hear people griping about having to invest in a new system.  Been there & done that multiple times.  I know of two groups that still play AD&D because they didn't want to reinvest in new a new system.  Nobody is putting a gun to your head to switch.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Hoshisabi on July  7, 2008 03:47 PM</strong></p>
<p>My big problem with it is that it has become less generic with this new edition.  D&D 3.5 was already starting to merge the fluff and the crunch together to the point where you had little things that would appear in your game that (as a GM) you might not approve of.</p>

<p>I saw more and more classes gain minor abilities that could only be explained as "magical."  I had a setting in mind where the magic and the martial were separate, but that was hard to maintain.</p>

<p>Now it's really impossible.  Fighters are based around abilities that are almost magical.  So are all the rest of the classes.</p>

<p>And in a stunning sense, wizards are a lot less magical than they have ever been.  I can't have a wizard that spends hours a day invisible.  He doesn't want to attack, he just wants to be invisible.  Well ... now I can only do it once per day at level 16 or higher.  Granted, as long as I don't attack, I guess I could sustain the spell all day.  That just doesn't capture the feel the way I wanted.  Even worse is the idea of the wizard who is almost permanently flying... that's now a daily spell that lasts a maximum of five minutes (granted, TWO daily spells, if you take both Fly and Mass Fly.)</p>

<p>I guess I'm just itching for a GURPS that has the appeal and simplicity of D&D 4ed.  I've thought for a long time that the system doesn't constrain the roleplaying that you can do within it, but sometimes it does introduce axioms into your story that you might not appreciate.  "All X are Y" and "No X are Y" type ideas that you get for every game using that system, so it's not entirely true that you can ignore the system.</p>

<p>Disappointing 4th edition really is.  Casters have been reduced to almost nothing.  The Spell Compendium from 3.5 is now ash.  There really is no ability to control how a mage learns spells.</p>

<p>All classes have, in essence, become the same.  The simpler learning curve of fighters compared to the advanced study of the mage is no more.  It makes it hard to use the imagination.</p>

<p>For instance:  a first level mage versus a first level fighter.  That magic missile comes full force smacking into the chest of that fighter.  The fighter, however, picks himself back up and then proceeds to hacking apart the mage with his axe.</p>

<p>10 levels later... 5 booming magic missiles come smack into the fighter while an already shot acid dart continues to pump acid into the fighter.  30 feet a way, the fighter still has a long way to go only find a glob of impenetrable darkness cast over him.  The only thing he hears is the chanting of the mage's newest spell, a fireball.</p>

<p>That has been the epitome of D&D.  It is the backbone of all their novels based on the rpg.  And it's gone.</p>

<p>I haven't played D&D for years (let's just say that when I last played we didn't have any fancy "editions") but I remember all too well the leveling curve Magical Tim describes. At low levels magic-users were practically a liability ("Come on guys, protect the magic-user. He'll be useful someday.") while at high levels everyone else is relegated to filling space while spells decide the course of the battle. I guess you could call it balance overall, but in practice it meant someone was always frustrated.</p>

<p>Maybe the 4th edition does a poor job of fixing the problem. Maybe it even makes things worse. But I'm not going to fault them for taking it on.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Mike on July 14, 2008 04:48 PM</strong></p>
<p>I can honestly say I've been playin D&D even longer than you - I still have all of the old 1st edition AD&D books, played second, played third, played 3.5 - picked up 4th and really wanted to like it.  Unfortunately it's just not D&D anymore - it's too pigeon holed, the mechanics and powers are sub-Diablo 2 level of interest.</p>

<p>This isn't a case of fear of change... it's a case of Wizards putting out a dud... and 4th edition is an absolute dud...</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Richelieu on July 16, 2008 03:19 PM</strong></p>
<p>I've been a DM/GM for 20+ years.  I've played a variety of different RPG's.  I've also read through the 4th Ed books, made a few characters, and ran a few mock combats.</p>

<p>I considered listing the pluses and minuses, but it really isn't worth it.  You are a DM, it's your house, change it to suit your needs.</p>

<p>My final analysis is this: no matter how you play it, the game was designed to emulate MMO's to some extent.  Hasbro is a corporation and they want a piece of the MMO pie.  If you don't think this is the case... just wait... I'm sure they will attempt an online MMORPG based on 4th (pls god not Eberron).</p>

<p>I will not run or play 4th Ed because they didn't just hearken back to the days of the pink box... but they flat-lined the class mechanics and pigeon-holed PC's, NPC's and monsters alike.  Adjustments can be made... but why bother?  3.5 has the depth I require.</p>

<p>Like I said, in the end, a DM can make it work to suit him.  Can change/flesh out the rules, expand npc's or monsters, etc.  It doesn't matter the system you use, use the one that suits you.  4th doesn't suit me, I deem it too "simple."</p>

<p>If you feel 4th is better because it's "sleak" or "streamlined"... just wait.  They'll be so many extra abilities, new classes (complete with new "multiclass" feats), paragon paths, epic paths, feats, skills, that those who feel bogged down now will once again have that familiar feeling.</p>

<p>Hasbro is here to make money.  A whole new set of books... allowing a revision of the old material to be republished... allowing an easy transition to an online game...</p>

<p>Now this may seem cynical... only time will tell.</p>

<p>Last thought:  As a GM, if you "taunt" one of my "mobs" you will be the first to die, and 10 minutes won't be enough to make you feel better.<br />

<p>I played D&D for a long time.  Basic and 1st are my favorite.  But I have enjoyed 2E, 3E, and 3.5E.  But for me, I don't enjoy 4E.  I find it bland and the magic is just wrong for me and my group.  I have played 4E a few times now.  For my group it's back to the earlier editions.</p>

<p>I think one of the problems is that they are trying to make the classes balanced against each other instead of building a party that is balanced against what it is fighting.  Oh well, I hope the new kids growing up enjoy 4E as much as I enjoyed the earlier editions.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Don Dennison on July 23, 2008 03:31 PM</strong></p>
<p>Well having just read reviews on 4th edition and not actually reading them myself i must say that the general feeling i get is that the game has been "streamlined" for simple conversion into a video game which would make sense given todays MMO game popularity. It would make sense (marketing) to launch a Pen and Paper game and identical MMO video game online to bolster the ranks of D&D players.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on July 23, 2008 06:04 PM</strong></p>
<p>I guess I just don't see how the video game metaphor holds up. If we're saying it uses the best of other roleplay systems that video and computer games use, sure, I suppose that's true. But the important differences between a video game and a tabletop game are still there. The DM still builds the world, the players still have a huge degree of freedom in their characters and in the world. It's still a bunch of people sitting around a table, rolling dice, eating pizza, and having fun. How is that like a video game?</p>

<p>We've now been playing Keep of the Shadowfell for about five weeks now. Not a single one of our players, even the relatively anti 4e guy, is complaining. The game is a blast.</p>

<p>Hi there.  I go way back to 1E and the original basic rules, then I played a lot of 2E in my day.  However, my group of friends that played broke up years ago when 2E was the latest version out there.  I felt that 2E was a worthy successor to the original AD&D, and we enjoyed it very much.  My only complaint back then was that they just flooded the market with too many different campaign worlds and optional rules booklets, to keep track.  I never picked up 3E or later versions, and from what I am hearing, I am glad that I got out at 2E.  I just went back and reread some of my 2E stuff, and I just love it.  I have checked out 3E and later stuff at the bookstores, and not been impressed.  </p>

<p>Did you guys even look further into the game? 4E books and gameplay, i agree has went down in quality. The hole point of the 4.0 is to make it easyer for there new online table top game to be understood and used by the younger people. I have been playing d&d from when 3.0 came out but i started in 2.0 ( i even still have the old books) 4E is enjoyable on its own, but you guys seem to forget that its not the original dnd, every E has changed the game so mutch, 4E is trying to remake it. That simple, I play with both 3.5 and4.0 rules by changing the 4.0 rules and adding in old 3.5 rules (im calling it 3.75 E) well email me if you have anything to tell me (mushiepang@gmail.com)</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: AenorVZ on July 31, 2008 03:20 AM</strong></p>
<p>I used to DM when I was in high school and at one point I had a campaign with about 13 players. Keeping that many people entertained to the point where they were kicking me awake every sunday to play in my world I thought was a pretty good endorsement of my skill in the area of extemporaneous fiction.</p>

<p>However, as a DM, I felt AD&D was broken because of its turn basis (let me stand around and watch other people move until it's my turn, then I can run across the room while everybody else is standing still). And honestly, it was always going to be limited to the core group of friends I gamed with.</p>

<p>When my roommate got me hooked on Everquest in 1999, it solved those two problems. The client-server architecture allowed simultaneous action by thousands of players. I didn't just play in that world for the next two years, I lived there. I know I'm not the only person who dreamed in-game dreams at night back in those days.</p>

<p>Just a note for those who have heard me talk about wanting to 6-box in EQ. Living Legacy gave me the chance to try it out, and I have to say it's pretty hard on the carpal tunnel syndrome. I went with cleric, warrior, shadow knight, druid, enchanter, wizard. I wish I'd had time to learn how to use Inner Space because that would have saved me alot of key strokes.</p>

<p>But nothing about that free time gave me any desire to pay to play the game in its current state. And that brings us back to my favorite subject. According to dev chat logs there will almost certainly be a new progression server as soon as Combine progresses to the current expansion, which could happen at any time. I'm predicting there will be one by the end of the year. To quote Redhenna:</p>

<p>"AenorVZ--The progresion servers where short term big successes, less so long term. Any further specialty ruleset using anything like similar rules(ie classic, another progression, etc) would be even less successfull short term. Further, SoE and EQ have limited dev time, which raises the question, is it better to use that limited resource to pull in short term profits, or to use it to improve the main game, working to retain players, create new players, and motivate players to return for the long haul. Which is most profitable over the next year or two?"</p>

<p>I'm going to keep pounding this into your heads until maybe one day you will wake up and get it. When thousands of players post on the forums asking for the same thing, it's bad business not to give it to them. The progression servers made SOE money. Now we're asking for a slow progression server that those of us who only subscribed for the first three months of the original progression servers might stay on for 9 months to a year. </p>

<p>That would be triple the profit for SOE, and that increased revenue for the game would justify the salaries of developers who are working on the current state of the game. And Redhenna, will you please just try to understand this... another progression server will take ZERO DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>ZERO</p>

<p>DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>They could have the server up and running in 5 minutes. So this is not a threat to you or anybody else who thinks that encouraging the devs to ignore popular outcry and focus on your narrow agenda is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Goffers on August  2, 2008 01:29 AM</strong></p>
<p>I have played D&D from Basic when I was 7 years old back in the early 80s until just buying 4th ed the other day.  I must say that I am really apprehensive with this system.  I am sure the proof will be in the pudding, in both the gameplay as well as convincing my gaming buddies to actually play the game.</p>

<p>It is hard to completely identify my concerns, but much of them I believe have to do with what everyone nowadays seems to call the "flavor."  By "flavor" it seems that this is a fairly irrelevant idiosyncratic taste that can be changed in a very simple fashion such as "let's pretend that the dragondudes don't look so ridiculous."  </p>

<p>However, sometimes the medium is the message. The mechanics of a game cannot help but fundamentally alter the so-called "flavor".  You cannot throw some sugar and cinnamon on a bologna sandwich and call it a ginger snap.</p>

<p>Ultimately, 4th ed rules set up a world that is far more like WOW than any fantasy novel.  Though there is a blanket notion that "if you don't like something you can change it", the aesthetics embedded within the rules suggest a game that is not much like role-playing and is more like the cooperative gaming found in WOW, or like in a board game.  I liked WOW, and played it for a few months before I became bored with it (as I do with nearly all MMOs).  I became bored with it because ultimately it feels like a meaningless solipsistic slog to me, more massively multiplayer mutual masturbation that anything else.  In true RPing people aren't so worried about going out without a healer and a tank or whatever.  Games are adjusted and the true importance is placed on the interesting characters and THE STORY - you know, character story arcs, moral choices, etc.  Gathering things to appear powerful is what is problematic about real life, I do not want to replicate it in game format.</p>

<p>Races and classes in 4th ed. are more designed around "playability" and "game balance" than they are about making sense in a specific game world.  For example, halflings have no penalty to str, dwarves not penalty to cha, elves to con, therefore humans are as weak as halflings, as charming as dwarves and as hardy as elves! Plate costs 50 gold! Dragondudes' most salient feature, scales all over there bodies, has no in game mechanic like damage reduction or improved AC.</p>

<p>This being said, I do appreciate the attempt to make characters fun at all levels in combat.  I just hope that this attempt does not ruin those aspects which are just as important, if not more, the time spent out of combat.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: that guy on August  2, 2008 11:05 PM</strong></p>
<p>i've read all of these review and im irritated. first and foremost im not gonna say how long i've played D&D and whatnot... all that crap doesn't really matter IMO... i like all the editions, for different reasons for each</p>

<p>what matters is this, they came out with a new system to use for the game, but the game is forever the essense of the creativity coming from the DM and the characters playing it... If you want WoW on a table, you could do that just as easily with 1st than with 2e-4e. Books are the basic mechanics of a gaming system to add paper justification of min/maxing a dream character (which will always be a crucial of PCing, but not its entirety) and challenges of monsters, puzzles, dungeons, and advanced (almost intimate) personality conflict and drama... How else could these corporation(s) come out with games like Shadowrun and Werewolf and BattleTech and (my old fav) Rifts and survive but by adding variety and flavor beyond what was the status quo...?</p>

<p>Bottom line of my arguement is this... You can hate on any one of the editions or games all you want... you're still at fault for either not having the creativity enough to dance around a numbers system and end up on top, or having a sh*tty DM/GM who can't think of any kind of story beyond "HACK SLASH BANG ZOOM MONSTER DEAD GOLD EXP REPEAT"</p>

<p>ROLE playing and ROLL playing is decided by the gamers, not the game. If you dont like the limit to spellflingers in their search for more variety in spells or you dont like how grunts are almost magical in their abilities as they grow... adapt, improvise, and overcome... (read as: use it, change the rules, and/or just keep playing!)</p>
