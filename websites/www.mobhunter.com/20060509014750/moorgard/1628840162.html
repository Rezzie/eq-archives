Speak with the fellow that gave them to you before for more information. <br>- Fixed a bug where casting Levant while on a horse could cause crashes. <br>- Fixed a problem that was preventing pet owners from controlling their regular pets if they had a Wake the Dead pet in use. <br>- Fixed a bug that caused characters to summon corpses with similar names rather than the intended corpse. <br>- Fixed a bug with Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword of Xuzl that prevented them from disappearing when they should. <br>-Temporarily removed the Scarecrow Change Form component from Nights Dark Terror to correct a faction issue. The Scarecrow form change will be reinstated in the near future. <br>- Fixed the spell gem colors for some Area of Effect spells. <br>- Corrected more issues with spell turn-ins. You should no longer get vendor sold spells, and all the spells you get should be at the appropriate level. <p>** Items ** <p>- Removed the level casting restriction from Necrotic Divining Device. <br>- Fungus Covered Scale Tunic is now Magic. <br>- Removed the &quot;Pending Lore&quot; tag from the Shralok Pack. There is no current plan to make this into a lore item. <p>** Alternate Advancement ** <p>- Corrected the description for Host of Elements. <p>** Tradeskills ** <p>- Fixed the invisible forge in Felwithe. <br>- Added Collapsing Fletching, and Collapsing Mortar and Pestle.

Dire news he brings to his master, the Lord Yelinak; there is much turmoil in wake of the prismatic's release, and he must inform the ancient dragon of the weary times to come. As he rushes past the lumbering trees on all sides of him, he harks back to a more peaceful time. Certainly the brow of his mighty Lord showed less strain, less agitation, though not much. He had always thought that the prismatic's release would surely be more problematic than anything else he could imagine. He now knew that there was much more at stake than ever before, and that the Shrine would need to be on its guard. <p>As he came to the entrance of the Shrine, he tensed for a moment, hoping that this dire news wouldn't end the life that he and his kin had known for so long. Yet he feared that nothing could stop that change, for the might of the Kin would be tested in the coming times, and there would surely be dangers he had yet to see. He made his way through the corridors up to his master's chambers. As he came closer, he noticed new members of the Kin he had never before seen. As large as his Lord, they spoke quietly amongst themselves and with Yelinak himself. He was unnerved by this startling addition to the Shrine, but felt that it was likely necessary. Perhaps his Lord had already heard the news and had already begun making plans. Either way, it was his duty to inform Yelinak of the recent events; the Giants would know no struggle like that which the Shrine would give them. <p>He walked towards Lord Yelinak, majestic in his appearance yet with a certain calming aura about him. He cleared his throat and began, &quot;M'lord Yelinak, I bring news from the East...&quot;</B><p>Shamans everywhere breathed a sigh of relief at the promise of a fix to mobs negating the effects of slow spells. While slows will continue to be mitigated in effectiveness, hopefully they will now work as intended.<p>Another big change is the increase in raid size to 72 members, or twelve groups instead of ten. This will ease up on the panic that occurs every time an apparition spawns to give character flags (OMG I NEED RAID INVITE ASAP PLZ!!!). The patch message also promises an increase in raid experience. Well, anything is better than zero, I guess. Killing 500 mobs and getting 1% AAXP makes you wonder why you even form a raid at all. By the way, I still think I'm the first person who equated raid exp with socialism, so don't <I>even</I> try to steal my thunder on that one.<p>Scarecrow form nerfed? Nooooooo! Thank goodness they left the flogloks alone.<p>Pickpockets mourned the loss of their ability to steal fungus tunics. So much for twinking all my Zek toons.<p>The increased performance of the /who all GUILD command is nice. Now it will be harder for ninjas in your guild to try and skip raids. Uberguilds will like it because it might help them root out spies a bit easier. And if you think I'm joking about that last part, you don't know the end game in EverQuest very well.<p>The mp3 player that was on Test server for a while went live, just in case you weren't already listening to music while you play EQ. Personally, I'm kind of digging all the new planar themes myself.<p>Skyshrine got its revamp today, bringing the ghetto servers up to the Legends standard--for now, at least. It looked like there was some decent mid-level loot dropping from the new mobs, which should give guilds living in the shadows of ubers something to shoot for.<p>All in all, this patch had a lot of worthwhile fixes and nice additional features. As ever, post any new discoveries or hidden nerfs below, or <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">drop me a line</a> and tell me about them.<p><BIG>Third Prize is You're Fired</BIG><p>For just about as long as EverQuest has been on store shelves, message boards have been a vital part of fostering the sense of community in the game. No single company has provided more of those discussion forums than EZBoard. From class boards to server boards to guild boards, an incalculable number of people rely on EZBoard for communication every day--Mobhunter included.<p>But in recent years, the pricetag for EZBoard's services has steadily been on the rise. This is natural in a climate where Internet-based companies need to show profit or face extinction, but some have argued that EZBoard's rates have soared beyond tenable levels. Many popular forums have moved to other hosting options, leaving EZBoard's hefty bandwidth-based charges behind.<p>Adding to the ranks of rebels are the moderators at Monkly Business, who have refused to pay the nearly $4000 bill that EZBoard wants to renew its Gold status. What this means is that those going to MB who haven't paid EZBoard on an individual basis will be inundated with pop-ups--including some of those evil, evil Gator ads.<p>This presents something of a dilemma for us at Mobhunter, because it has always been our policy not to link to sites that present you with potentially dangerous pop-ups. But since the monk board is a good source of info--and since there are several means to avoid getting hit by the pop-ups--we will continue to link to stories there, albeit with an advisory attached.<p>How do you avoid the pop-ups? There are several freeware programs that block them, or you can switch to a browser like Mozilla that has the functionality built in. You can, of course, become an EZBoard subscriber and thus avoid them entirely. Whatever you think about it, EZBoard is a company that provides a service, and they're just trying to make money like everyone else.<p>The larger issue in all this is what happens when other sites stop paying for EZBoard and either live with the pop-ups or use an alternative message board service. One of the nice things about EZBoard is that once you're logged in, you're logged in to every message board you access. Alternative boards (like shamans, shadowknights, and clerics employ) all require individual logins and passwords, which can be a huge hassle.<p>It would be great if another global option came along that was an alternative to EZBoard, but such universal acceptance seems unlikely at this point in time. If I were Sony, I'd be a little concerned by all this, since message boards are a huge part of what holds the EQ community together. All the more reason to keep their EQIM program free and to foster even more ways to keep their players talking to one another.<p><BIG>The @#$%ing Leads Are Weak? <I>You're</I> Weak</BIG><p>Zaar, leader of the uber juggernaut known as <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/">Triton</a> on the Povar server, recently posted a little <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=60a1feceba15fccd0ed6becdda71719e&amp;threadid=3792">perspective</a> on life as a necromancer. Rather than complain about endless nerfs and rant about how hard it is to find groups, Zaar embraces his role as a necro while providing clear evidence of bugs that need to be fixed in order to improve his class.<p>Sure, most of the time the Triton board contains nearly as many expletives as a Mamet screenplay, but Zaar states his case in a calm and reasonable manner. Hopefully Verant is paying attention and gives these issues the response they deserve.<p>No matter how much certain classes have been nerfed, all of them have a role in the game, especially in Planes of Power. Hyperbole such as the monk outcry over the defensive changes (&quot;we suck now,&quot; &quot;we're useless&quot;) help neither the game nor your place in the universe.<p>There are times when it's hard for any class to find a group, guilded or not. But ultimately, if you're a good player, you will become known as such and will be invited to groups more often than not. Those of us who have been in the game a long time remain so because of the relationships we have buit, and those relationships are far stronger than what class you play or whatever the latest nerf is.<p><BIG>I Made $970,000 Last Year. How Much You Make?</BIG><p>If you would indulge a departure from the world of EverQuest for just a moment, I wanted to talk a little more about <I><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0104348">Glengarry Glen Ross</a></I>. My fear is that some of you will run out and rent or buy the DVD and send me hate mail saying &quot;This piece of crap is your favorite movie? You owe me $20, jackass!&quot;<p>This is a film in which very little actually happens. It's the story of a group of salesmen who work in an office, and a crime that occurs there. No gun fights, no car chases, no sex scenes. Just lots of razor-sharp dialogue and a script so tight you can bounce quarters off it.<p>The reason I love this film so much is that it's basically a clinic on how to be an actor. Every performance in this movie is Oscar-caliber on its own, but to combine them together into one film is astonishing. Al Pacino tears up the scenery. Ed Harris fills the screen with vindictiveness and greed. Alec Baldwin gives the performance of his life. A pre-fame Kevin Spacey renders a startlingly brilliant reading as the office weasel. But above them all, Jack Lemmon caps his career as the floundering Sheldon Levine, a lost soul that makes Willy Lomen look stable.<p>The film is based on David Mamet's play, and he also wrote the screenplay. With not a syllable out of place, Mamet provides the ammunition that this troup of actors delivers in spades.<p>The cast decided to forgo their usual paychecks and worked for scale on this project, making it truly a labor of love that doesn't happen too often in Hollywood. Maybe this adds to the mystique of the film for me, making it all the more special.<p>So no, I'm not trying to sell you on this movie. It honestly isn't for everyone--especially if curse words make you blush, because this movie has more of them than any other I've seen. But for those of you who appreciate the craft and artistry that goes into making motion pictures, I can think of no finer example than <I>Glengarry Glen Ross.</I><p>&quot;Will you go to lunch? Go to lunch. <I>Will</I> you <I>go</I> to <I>lunch?</I>&quot;
