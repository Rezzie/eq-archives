<h1 class="article_title">Vanguard, LOTRO, and the Secrets of Faydwer</h1>
<p>by Loral on May 26, 2007</p>

<p>The circles of massive online gaming grows ever wider. The industry's reaction to the success of World of Warcraft is beginning to pay off as new games are released in a post World of Warcraft industry. Today we will talk about two of newer games; Vanguard and Lord of the Rings Online; as well as discuss Everquest's latest announced expansion, Secrets of Faydwer.</p>

<p>The criers cried loudly over the past few weeks in relation to Vanguard. A few months ago, <a href="http://www.sigilgames.com/sonypressrelease.html">Sigil announced</a> that Sony Online would manage Vanguard's back-end maintenance including servers and support. Later in a highly publicized and brutal set of articles we learned that Sigil, the company behind Vanguard, brought the entire staff into the parking lot and <a href="http://www.f13.net/?itemid=560">fired them</a>. While half of the staff ended up getting hired on by SOE, who now controls the entire Vanguard game, not just the back-end maintenance, the other half did not.</p>

<p>I was reminded of an <a href="http://dvinfo.net/conf/archive/index.php/t-11246.html">article I read</a> a few years ago when Microsoft shut down a major operation in Japan. In Japan, there is often an unspoken bond between employers and employees. Employment is often for life. When Microsoft's Xbox sales took a dive in Japan, they brought a large number of employees in to a conference room, told them they were fired, and escorted them out the opposite door outside the building. They had no idea how the employees would react and thought it safer than dropping a pink slip into a mail box.</p>

<p>An unofficial and <a href="http://www.f13.net/index.php?itemid=561">anonymous interview with one of the Sigil casualties</a> circulated as well giving an incredibly detailed, albeit one-sided, accounting of the development of Vanguard. Though clearly biased, this interview gave quite a bit of detail into the lack of solid development, the lack of clear direction, and the importance of saving face to the outside world while inside its a rats nest of office politics and duct-tape coding.</p>

<p>Held within the arms of SOE, Vanguard is likely to exist for a long while. Those few who enjoy the game can likely continue playing it as long as they desire.</p>

<p>If I had to make one clear statement about what caused a game like Vanguard to fail, I would point at system requirements. World of Warcraft made a few points very clear when considering the success of a massive online game:</p>

<p>1. You have to support lower powered systems.</p>

<p>2. You have to support soloing.</p>

<p>3. You have to give clear direction for progression with quests and a rewarding leveling curve.</p>

<p>In another case study, we have Lord of the Rings Online. While I have not played the game myself, I have seen it over my right shoulder on my wife's system. Lord of the Rings learned much from Warcraft in both the interface and the game design. The UI is clean and requires no customization to be effective. The quests are streamlined, well understood, clearly labeled, and polished. Though not as system-friendly as WoW, the game runs well on lower powered systems and flawlessly on current hardware platforms.</p>

<p>One aspect of Lord of the Rings Online has a clear advantage over World of Warcraft: Middle Earth.</p>

<p>Blizzard has done a good job over the past ten years in building a solid fantasy world but it's nothing when compared to the power J.R.R Tolkein's Lord of the Rings has held over the fantasy genre for the past fifty years. Much of the fantasy we enjoy these days comes from the original thoughts of Tolkein. No other story has impacted fantasy as much as Lord of the Rings and, with the recent success of the three films, there is probably no more valuable piece of intellectual property for a game world. Whatever Turbine paid for the rights, it was worth it.</p>

<p>Turbine, the developers of Lord of the Rings Online, or LOTRO to those who walk Middle Earth, learned well from their history. They developed three other massive online games; Asheron's Call, Asheron's Call 2, and Dungeons and Dragons Online. They developed a game that is easy to play, plays well on older hardware, and captures Middle Earth enough that fans of the world feel like they're part of the story. It has all of the makings of a successful MMO and, from initial reports, that success has been initially achieved.</p>

<p>Turbine's history is not flawless, however. The failure of Asheron's Call 2 is well known as one of the largest failures of any massive online game. If MMO producers learn one lesson from history, they would do well to learn it from Turbine's actions with Asheron's Call 2 and SOE's self-declared mistake in naming Everquest 2 as a sequel to Everquest. MMO sequels hurt not only the sequel but also the original. With three active MMOs, it would also do well for Turbine to consolidate the back end maintenance and support of all their games into a single infrastructure as SOE has done. Doing so builds a much more stable environment for the survival of MMOs with lower numbers of subscribers.</p>

<p>Lord of the Rings Online has a lot going for it and I expect it to do very well. It won't dethrone World of Warcraft, but it would not surprise me to hear of subscriptions over one million.</p>

<p>Now we turn our spyglasses to the west where SOE recently announced Secrets of Faydwer, the fourteenth expansion for Everquest due for release in November 2007. This announcement came shortly after Clint Worley's producer's letter which described a new yearly release cycle beginning this November and every November thereafter.</p>

<p>SOE released a few facts with the announcement including a level increase to 80 and the new spells and AAs required with any level increase. The expansion looks to be an overland expansion based in Faydwer with possibly two larger endzones, one the lair of a gnomish necromancer and the other surrounding one of Norrath's most notorious villains, Kerafyrm The Sleeper. </p>

<p>Those adventurers of the old worlds remember Kerafyrm as the devastating force released from the Sleeper's Tomb. Kerafyrm was the only monster to ever walk across zones in Everquest, killing every player and non-playing character in every zone in which it traveled. In a great tale captured in the legends of Everquest, Kerafyrm was actually killed on a single server, Rallos Zek, by over 150 players in a three or four hour period of constant attacking, dying, and resurrecting. Many old time players will enjoy facing off against the most powerful of dragons later this year.</p>

<p>With a year gap between the release of Secrets of Faydwer and the next Everquest expansion, Secrets must contain a lot of events, encounters, zones, and rewards to keep players happy and continuing to play throughout the year. It is unlikely any expansion beyond Planes of Power can contain enough to keep all players happy and playing throughout the year.</p>

<p>As we get closer to November, we will likely hear more of the features contained in Secrets of Faydwer.</p>

<p>Turning our spyglass to Blizzard, we see the release of the World of Warcraft 2.1 patch. We should all recognize the importance of us downloading a 300 meg patch so that the upper .001% of WoW players can have the Black Temple to feast upon. I kid, of course, but as a player who primarily spends his days hunting fel-gazelles in hellish grassy lands that look strangely similar to lands in which I hunted at level 25, I can only watch the most excellent <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/2p1/#">Black Temple trailer</a> and imagine that, if I had 20 extra hours a day, I too could walk those cursed lands and face Illidan himself.</p>

<p>Maybe someday.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Ghost of Zek on May 28, 2007 11:32 AM</strong></p>
<p>Just thought I'd chime in and ask everyone a quick question;</p>

<p>1) For those of you still playing Everquest Live!; what do you see as the essential top 3 things SOE needs to do in order to both expand the user base, and keep the existing players in the new expansion?</p>

<p>2) For those of you no longer playing Everquest Live!; what (if any) key three things could/should SOE do to draw you back as a regular player for not less than 12 months.</p>

<p>I'll start off with my own three answers as a former player.</p>

<p>a) Drop the prices on the EQ subscription (and all single games) to 9.95 a month and 14.95 for the station pass.</p>

<p>b) Unify the currency systems from LDoN, DoN, and forward, to one cross compatible currency, and make risk+time vs. reward balanced throughout.</p>

<p>c) Ensure that all trade skill drops (with the exception of truely rare quest arc drops), are available to un-keyed, un-grouped players.  Or alternately, ensure that there are solo methods to gain access to all "group" or "keyed" areas.</p>

<p>Simply put, EQ and the SOE products for the most part (with the exception of EQ2 IMO) lack the polish to rate the fee SOE charges.  Tons of bugged content does not = value.  Second, there is no unified method of advancement of gear/spells in EQ, this needs resolved.  Lastly, players need to know that they can at some point without needing an "ubber" guild access most of the content of the game at some point even if they have to work a little harder than those that had ubber guilds.  Content still locked out to the average user because the game itself lacks the sheer MASS of users still interested in it two, three, even five years later is, too put it simply not "content", it's wasted space on the users harddrive.</p>

<p><br />
haha - I see the grass is the same shade of green. :)</p>

<p><br />
Regarding the Sigil purchase, I found the interview with Brad McQuaid to be an interesting read. <a href="http://www.f13.net/index.php?itemid=562">http://www.f13.net/index.php?itemid=562</a>  As Moorgard pointed out <a href="http://www.moorgard.com/?p=125">http://www.moorgard.com/?p=125</a> there are a lot of perspectives on this type of situation.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Regarding the EverQuest expansion, I believe that for the expansion to be truely successful, a better effort needs to be made on expanding more of the game. Introducing content (especially spells and AA's) for lower levels, removing the laser-focus on the "next 5" levels of the game will be a big part of making the game appeal to more potential players.</p>

<p>IMHO, the biggest knock that I had with the 6 month expansion cycle was that the devs had to stay too focused in the scope of what they were building. Loosen things up, put a strong zone/abilities effort in for the 60+ crowd, and dramatically speed up the xp curve in the 50's (seriously, don't write content, just bend the curve), and I think things will go pretty well, and might even pull a few more folks back into the fold.</p>

<p>Just wanted to chime in on Ghost of Zek's post, where I fall into the #2 category. The primary key things that EQ1 can do to bring me back:</p>

<p>* Reduce the landmass size! Instead of making the world more and more ginormous with every expansion pack, try revising the zones you already have! Give them a bloody history for crying out loud! As it is, people are so stretched thin that it's simply no fun at all.</p>

<p>* I concur with unifying the currency and make all of the corresponding systems less complicated. I'm all for customization and alternate advancement, but the EQ1 implementation leaves alot to be desired for me. EQ2 on the other hand, I'm pretty happy with.</p>

<p>That's about it from me! I've been purposefully silent on the whole Vanguard situation, part out of the sheer disappointment I've felt from the let down of it all, part because it's been said so well in many other blogs. =)</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Redhenna on May 29, 2007 03:37 AM</strong></p>
<p>On Ghost of Zek's question:  I fall into catagory 2, and as much as I have high regard for EQ, probably there is nothing that SoE can do to bring me back.  I played for close to 7 years, and with my life situation, had very high playtime for most of that.  I hit a point where I had been there, done that, and EQ just was not fun any more...not through real fault of the game, but after so much time, it just got old.  I went to Eve Online, largely because it was so completely different from EQ.  Most MMO's felt alot like more of the same.  EQ2 was a level based MMO, WoW was a level based MMO with crappy graphics and annoying playerbase.  DDO did nothing for me. DAoC ditto.  CoH was not bad, but still not great.  With all these games, I felt I could log on, and within a few minutes, I had the basics of how to controll what I did, and the basic ideas of how to advance, all figured out.  Eve, after a 2 hour tutorial, I still felt overwhelmed, and loved it.</p>

<p>For there to be any chance of me going back to EQ, it would need to add lots of really hard single group content, and lots and lots of reasons to exp(levels/AA's).  Hitting that max level/AA barrier was incredibly demotivating to me, and really suck the fun out of the game.  Combining that with all single group content being totally trivial at my gear/AA level(I am still somewhat bitter over the AG/FC difficulty nerf...I went from having the most fun I had had in EQ since GoD, to totally bored), and it got harder and harder to log on.</p>

<p>Of course, to do what it would take to get a player like me back, would require doing things that might be less than ideal for EQ as a whole.  My situation was definatly outside the norm.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Pants on May 29, 2007 08:48 AM</strong></p>
<p>It really is exciting times for MMO fans nowadays. There are so many choices to fit many tastes, and even more games with promise on the horizon. This was really not the case even 5 years ago as most of the games were basically slight variations of the same theme or just released with such poor quality that there was no point in even bothering to try them. I have tried LOTRO and it is a good quality game. I don't see any glaring faults with it but yet I could not get into it. It felt too much like WoW to me and I've already played WoW since release, so I got bored with LOTRO rather quick and canceled. Still if people haven't tried WoW because of the crappy player base but want a game that's very easy to get into LOTRO could be for them. Also it could be good for a short break from WoW if you're currently a WoWhead.</p>

<p>As for what SOE could do to bring me back, nothing would work. I don't see any point in going back to something I played for 6 years. It's not like it's going to keep my interest long no matter what they add. I have recently upgraded to a new computer and want to move forward with new stuff, not rehash the past. Heck I even refuse to go back to City of Heroes and I loved that game at one point. Cryptic didn't want to spend much effort adding new content and instead wasted a year nerfing pretty much everything so they won't be getting my buck again. Besides SOE should spend their efforts trying to retain as many people they have now for as long as possible with the kind of stuff that those type of players would want. They aren't ever going to attract many of the people who quit back to the game for any extended time. Time has passed EQ by and the MMO world moves on a new direction. There is nothing wrong with this and in fact it's a good thing. Who wants a stagnant gaming industry?</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Teremar on May 29, 2007 10:41 AM</strong></p>
<p>One thing the WoW lore has that EQ hasn't had for a long time is beings that are far beyond the power of any mere PC. Players seem to take a positive pleasure in "knowing" that Arthas would easily wipe out any raid guild, let alone one of the Aspects, or the Old Gods, or the Titans (though it's funny how many "badly weakened" Old Gods you run into). There's even been some grumbling about the prospect of players defeating Illidan (who, incidentally, has been part of the Warcraft lore since long before Pan's Labyrinth was made--not that a scary guy with horns and bat wings is at all original).</p>

<p>EQ? Meh, we've been killing gods for years. Any time some ultimate enemy is introduced you know it's just a matter of time before the raiders have him on farm status. The Sleeper though, he was different. Him you couldn't kill. (Well, you *could*. I remember hunting orcs outside High Hold Keep while someone updated everyone on the progress of the Rallos Zek kill--and explained what it took to pull it off. At the time that just added to the mystique.)</p>

<p>Maybe it's just another instance of that "first MMORPG magic" but I'll be rather disappointed if The Sleeper turns into just another raid boss. Something needs to keep those player egos in check.</p>

<p>(And uh, Loral, did you not notice the three new quest hubs for solo/occasional-group players in 2.1?)</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Mytwocents on May 29, 2007 02:09 PM</strong></p>
<p>The obvious fact is SOE wants to increase retention and bring players back? How?</p>

<p>1. Keep everything as it is. Most casuals are 4-5 expansions behind and realizing they may not see cool end zones or encounters for years. Let them buy other games that offer beating entire game in 6 months. Let players dry up until ubers run out of recruiting pool.</p>

<p>Easy Alternatives: Increase drop rates on encounters except for latest. Double the Epic Orbs in Anguish. Double the Rare boss drops. Double the drops. This gears players up faster.  What top guild really cares if Anguish or Demi drops are double?  More gear will push guilds through and tighten spread.  More players concentrated in newer expansion. More players buying expansions because they are 'done' with old one.</p>

<p>2. No more currencies. No more multi endzones. One endzone with a great storyline. This last expansion could have been great if it was 100% pirates. Katta run-around city, pyramids, underwater ruins = waste. Focus. Do one thing and do it well. Tie it to one story.</p>

<p>ps, expansion before that, frostcrypt vs arcstone. How about a tunnel between them?<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: wormy on May 29, 2007 02:09 PM</strong></p>
<p>I fall under 2 too ;)</p>

<p>SOE needs to add a way to close the level gap for returning players, the AA gap and the equipment gap. Without this, there's absolutely no way to go back to this old grinding game.</p>

<p>My main is up to GoD/OoW equipment (I was in a top raiding guild back then).<br />
Now, with several expansions released, there was still no way to upgrade my equipment, without joining such a top raiding guild again (that is, no useful rewards for group or even solo content).<br />
My playing time is nowhere near it was back in the ol'days.</p>

<p>If I may return to this game, there'll be 10 or more levels to catch up, several hundreds of AA points to grind, and still no way to get upgrades without a raid guild - and no way to join a raid guild without the necessary equipment (looks like a catch-22).</p>

<p>I played this game since beta3 - maybe it just lost the magic over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Chark on May 29, 2007 04:05 PM</strong></p>
<p>You may no longer be End Game<br />
But ALOT of Guilds are NOT End Game</p>

<p>Come back to the game and you will find a raiding guild that suits your real life there are many out there now, That do not raid 10 hours a day 6 days a week.</p>

<p>The reason SoE is suppose to be going to one expansion a year is because so few guilds are raiding past Anguish or Dreadspire.</p>

<p>There is only one Guild per Server that is truly END GAME these days. Everyone else is very far behind. <br />
.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: RosesAreRed on May 29, 2007 04:51 PM</strong></p>
<p>There are a few things which would be easy for SOE to do to encourage new and casual players.... both in the old game zones and in the next expansion.</p>

<p>After the tutorial, put new players in their home racial city so they can meet other newbies, learn how to play a class and adventure, immerse and explore vs grinding in "hot zones" to try to catch up.  POK is too generic.  If I were a newbie dumped there, dazed after a tutorial which has nothing to do with the lore of the game, I wouldn't know where to begin to find a group or a zone to play in.  I believe in quite a bit of hand holding at the low levels to lead a player into the lore of the game... and both WOW and LOTRO have proven this is something gamers want.</p>

<p>Make all the zones with similar level encounters similar in experience and rewards.  I understand that new expansion zones need an edge to encourage people to buy , but there is no reason for the disparity in the old content. There are many many zones that no one plays in because it isn't worth it.  I hear returning players, especially, regretting this.  They remember these zones as great fun to explore and play in ... getting there as a goal to aspire to or starting a new char to play there, but no one will play there with them because the newer, grinding zones give the best rewards.</p>

<p>Avoid creating zones, such as the low level Stone Hive, which are creatively and visually very appealing but are avoided and empty because 1) they are in out of the way, obscure places 2) almost all of the drops are quest items - useless no drops for most players 2) there are way too many adds for a balanced group of the correct level to deal with, so almost everyone playing there does so with high level guardians.  They finish a quest and then leave - never to return.</p>

<p>Definitely add more solo content at all levels.  Although I am not one, there are many people who like to solo kite or do solo experience quests ...  they can log on for an hour or so, have a lot of fun, and leave without messing up a group they have joined or feeling guilty because they have neglected real life obligations.  Meanwhile, they have leveled a little or finished a quest for a nice prize and feel they have accomplished something vs wasted an hour or two LFG with nothing to show for it. </p>

<p>Gimp flagging to open content to more players and the guild standards which enable raiders to quickly join their raids are both the type of innovations which have made the higher end game more accessible to casual players and less of a time sink. The guild lobby and the guild halls are also examples of additions which have made the game a lot more fun, especially for those who have limited playing time.</p>

<p>Definitely unify the currency and rewards offered in the different expansions.  Like the "too many zones too spread out" complaint, there are so many  <br />
requirements to fulfill - faction, level, etc. that, again, it's next to impossible for any but the hard core to make use of what they earn or to find groups willing to work to completion on these projects. </p>

<p>I hear even seasoned, old time players asking in /general how to get this item (to use the magus) or that key (for their younger alts).  It's too much, diverse information to keep track of.  Like The Abysmal Sea (seemed like a great idea for trade skillers - but no one goes there) these complicated ideas make the game less fun, not more interesting.</p>

<p>KEEP THE BOXED SETS ON THE SHELVES of major game retailers.  The last set with all the expansions at a reasonable price was very popular but hard to find.  Many players who had fallen behind with the last downloads rushed to upgrade when the set hit the shelves.  Since the rewards of old vs new zones are so unequal, players who don't have all the expansions have no hope of finding a group. </p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: RosesAreRed on May 29, 2007 06:11 PM</strong></p>
<p>A final thought on the yearly expansion vs 6 month interval.</p>

<p>Almost everyone I chat with who has been playing for a lot of expansions has bag and bags of items from unfinished quests, flags and missions.  Each time a new expansion came out ... everyone rushed to it, abandoning the content they had been working on because the fun of exploring new places and the better rewards to be found made the old content obsolete.</p>

<p>I am curious if the yearly cycle will allow people to go back and finish all these quests or if the rewards are too menial to be worth the trouble.</p>

<p>It would also be nice if SOE would make a "keyring" for flags, similar to the keyring for keys.  The current system of running around to seerers for POP flag info is confusing and time consuming. Why not just make it easy to find out what is missing without a 3rd party parser?</p>

<p>Meanwhile ... items that people have long ago forgotten what they are for ... continue to clog the bank bags of everyone thinking they MIGHT finish up that one last ........ someday .....</p>

"Come back to the game and you will find a raiding guild that suits your real life there are many out there now, That do not raid 10 hours a day 6 days a week."</p>

<p>This may be true for the US time zones - but outside the US there are not enough people left playing. SOE abandoned the international markets.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: xsi on May 30, 2007 05:28 PM</strong></p>
<p>I think it is very telling that, eventually, every thread about what to do to fix EQ ends up being a thread about raiding.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: RosesAreRed on May 30, 2007 07:48 PM</strong></p>
<p>But not really surprising, since the raiders are the original players, and there is no way for a new player to catch up or incentive for them to do so.  Which leaves only raiders, their alts and returning players who demand more more more high level content.</p>

<p>Imagine you are just starting to play a game. You have many factions to repair (if you can figure them out through research on 3rd party sites because you know no one to talk to) to get armor, loots, cash and prizes and to even play in certain zones ... none of these interconnected.  </p>

<p>Even if you manage to make a few friends and level up a bit, the newbie zones are empty, the zones of progression are empty, the LDONs are empty, the MMs are empty, the equipment you can get is so inferior that it is practically useless and the only way to level is to grind as best you can.</p>

<p>Most guilds don't want you unless you are at least level 65, so you don't have the advantage of a group to mentor you.  </p>

<p>So you cancel your subscription and go play another game.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: xsi on May 30, 2007 07:57 PM</strong></p>
<p>"But not really surprising, since the raiders are the original players..."</p>

<p>Says who?  I know a number of non-raiders who have played EQ since its launch.  My wife and I are two of them.</p>

<p>Your post was very much the sort of behavior I was commenting on.  The raiding population in EQ seems more and more convinced that there is no other type of player in EQ... and that assertion seems like a potentially self fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>If EQ is supposed to be only about raiding, then SOE should ditch 2/3 of the content, narrow their focus to just raids, and see what that strategy accomplishes for them.  </p>

<p>Otherwise, any thoughts about revitalizing EQ must, in my mind, treat the other playstyles as more than just intermediate and ephemeral steps on the inevitable path to becoming a raider.</p>

<p>I realize that my prior post may have sounded harsh or preachy.  </p>

<p>My point is that, if SOE wants EQ to be about anything other than raiding, they have to look at ways to revitalize those other styles of gameplay as well... and not merely as a means for would-be raiders to level up and join guilds.</p>

<p>Too often, I see comments on the problems with the pre-70 game that are purely looking at it from a raiding perspective, or something that people should be able to push through as quickly as possible so that they can get to the 'real game' of raiding.  If raiding is the whole point of EQ, then you should do away with the early game entirely or extrapolate raids down to the low levels, so people can raid their way from 1-75 (soon to be 80).  Honestly, I think that's a losing proposition for EQ.  While it is definitely one of the games with the most raiding content, I'm not sure whether, despite their extremely vocal presence on the boards, there are actually enough raid-focused people to carry EQ on their own.</p>

<p>I would much rather see more done to revitalize the 1-60/1-75 group game and attract new players of all playstyles.  Some of them will certainly go on to join raid guilds, while others will remain content in the group content.  To get the sort of critical mass you'll need to keep EQ healthy at those levels though, you need to satisfy multiple playstyles, as, more often than not, it's the lifelong groupers who provide people for the would-be raiders to group with.  Focus too much on one or the other, (or avoid marketing at all, as is the current modus operandi), and you'll continue to face the existing issues of not having enough people of the appropriate levels to group with.</p>

<p>As for what could be done, there have been a number of suggestions.</p>

<p>(1) Newbie server.  Sort of an outgrowth of the escape from norrath free tutorial server, but available for all to create players on, and highlighted as a 'newbie server' with preferred (green) status on the server selection.  Cap levelling at a certain point below the normal servers, and allow free character transfers to/from other servers at any point below the max level.  Reuse the tutorial server population so that people trying the game out for free mingle with existing players, and maybe even extend the free trial period to level 30.</p>

<p>(2) Cross-server grouping.  Sort of like (1) but without the physical server namespace.  </p>

<p>I like (1) better though just for the server atmosphere.  Each makes it easier to find groups though, which would in turn make it more likely that a new player would stick around and continue to play, thus addressing the population and grouping concerns.</p>

<p>I'd also like to see the newbie experience continue to be revamped.  TSS was SOE's attempt at this, but Crescent Reach is a HORRIBLE newbie city in my opinion.  It's laggy, it's confusing, and it has freaking lifts that have and will kill more than a few people.  Worse, the TSS content past about lvl 30 tends to be significantly harder than old world content, making it that much more likely that people get frustrated and quit.  Add in the unavailability of spells, the horrible weapoons, and the need to trek to PoK for a lot of stuff, and I think TSS would have been a failure at attracting significant numbers of new players, even if it HAD been marketed.  </p>

<p>Basically, SOE seemed uncertain of what TSS was was really supposed to be... a self contained 'entrance' to EQ, with quality content from 1-75, or just another expansion for existing players, which also happened to have some lower level zones.  To accomplish the former, they would need to revamp the city, (replace lifts with stairs or portals, or something!), and revisit the RvR of the mid-level zones in the expansion to figure out why even level appropriate players rarely go there.  (Lessen the number of no drop, unsellable, crap quest gear, fix pathing, get rid of unnecessarily harsh procs, etc.)</p>

<p>Anyway, my point is that I don't think EQ can survive purely by focusing on the raiders, whatever the raiders think.  And, while I believe SOE realizes this, they need to do more to attract and retain players from levels 1-60+, either through content, better means of finding groups, increased marketing, or all three.</p>
