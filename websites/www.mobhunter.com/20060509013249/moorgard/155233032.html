<html><head><title>Leaving Las Vegas</title></head><body><h1>Leaving Las Vegas</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-03-30</p><BIG>Daddy Needs a New Pair of Shoes</big><p>At what might be the most-attended FanFaire ever, news on upcoming game changes was plentiful. Also on tap were peeks at EverQuest 2 and <a href="http://planetside.station.sony.com/">PlanetSide</a>, two upcoming SOE titles that seemed to impress a lot of folks.<p>While more detailed reports and transcripts will be forthcoming, here are some details showing up on the various message boards so far:<p>- <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=38073.topic">Monks</a> will see half their mitigation abilities returned in Tuesday's patch<p>- <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=20874">Rangers</a> will be more responsible for their damage after the patch because of hate list changes--the limit of 60 players on the list will be removed, as will the impact distance has on hate generated; the fix to various missle attack bugs is still in progress, though<p>- <a href="http://www.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=16100">Necros</a> and other DoT casters should be seeing their DoT damage displayed in the future; necros will have their level 65 pet fixed as well<p>Someone on the bard board <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=16903.topic">summed up</a> a few more comments:<p><B>Beastlords will probably get MGB... &quot;we gave warrior's a taunt button, we need to make it do something&quot; -- Scott Hartsman re: Warrior's vs Knight Classes holding aggro... Explanations that they dont want to kill enchanter's charm abilities, but increase the risk, and try and stop things like chanter pets flat out tanking for groups which was never intended... New spell gems arent going to happen anytime soon, but they'd love to do it... Numerically displaying mana could be coming some day...</b><p>Monks, of course, are all cheerful about the announced change, and are optimistically looking forward to seeing the effect it will have upon their class... maybe monks on Mars, that is. It comes as no surprise that most have already concluded the change isn't enough and won't be happy until they can tank the Emperor again. The lessons of the past are lost on some of these people. Ever notice that rangers still take crap for dying so much? It's because they actively undertook a campaign of letting everyone know how much they sucked back in the day, and guess what? People believed it, and still do--even though they don't suck at all anymore. Monks need to cool it before the damage they do to their class is irreparable.<p>Rangers have been both anxious and worried about modifications to archery--and they should be. The change to the hate list may be an inconvenience to some, but it makes sense from a game standpoint. Now when mobs ping-pong around, rangers will get screamed at even before wizards.<p>The Safehouse has a nice summary of <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm31.showMessage?topicID=98.topic">EQ2 features</a> taken from the May issue of Computer Gaming World that is sure to whet the appetites of many. Honestly, not seeing the EQ2 demo is the biggest bummer of missing FanFaire, because I am <I>really</i> looking forward to this game. Starting over at zero is okay if the world is compelling enough, and by the look of it EQ2 has the best chance of making the leap worthwhile.<p>Keep in mind that most of the news reported so far is subject to the frailties of human memory and the dangers of misinterpretation. Don't jump to too many conclusions until you read the notarized transcripts, which should show up soon.<p><B>*** Updated 4:00PM CT Monday, 3/31 ***</B><p>Today Absor <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=155233032&amp;msgid=-1009470803#message">clarified</a> some of the information presented above:<p><B>Quick points about some of the stuff that is linked to or mentioned in this article.<p>1) We are indeed changing the way Monks mitigate. But Len [Lenardo of Monkly Business] made up that 50% number. We never gave a number. What we said was, it will be better than it is, but it's not going back to the way it was.<p>2) We are not implementing any &quot;archery&quot; changes with the patch tomorrow. We are improving the limitations of the Hate list, meaning that folks won't drop off the end of the hate list anymore (and that would usually be those using range combat, including archery and spells). An archery/missile spell update (for things like walls causing missiles to poof) will not be implemented until the whole system is looked over in full. When that will be, we don't know at this time.<p>3) The exception to #2 is some changes to archery in PvP.<p>4) &quot;-- They acknowledged that they know Child of Bertox (65 pet) needs fixing and will be fixed in the near future.&quot; Actually, we said that we've been testing it. We haven't actually decided if it needs fixing or not.<p>Eventually I'll make sure that a relatively complete and accurate transcript is posted someplace, so you won't have to read what other people think they remember that we said. But it's about 3 hours of recorded material, and I don't type all that fast...</B><p>Like we said, until the official transcripts are up you're just getting hearsay. We elected to run with the news circulating on the message boards with the disclaimer that you get what you pay for.<p>The <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/scheduled_downtime.jsp">Scheduled Downtime Page</a> has just been updated with the following: <p><B>The patch originally scheduled for Tuesday, April 1st, has been cancelled. <p>The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>So there won't be any changes tomorrow after all...<p><BIG>I Hate to Ask for More</big><p>As I mentioned in the report of my trip to the SOE offices, the Plane of Hate has been under reconstruction, and it looks like the devs have put the zone up for some playtesting. Over on the ranger board, a Test server inhabitant named Splunge gave a <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=20697">rundown</a> of the changes to the zone:<p><B>The mobs are basically the same, but some have gotten an upgrade. The layuot is competly different, imagine the old city just expanded and made much bigger. Mobs at zonein are a little weaker then regular Hate mobs, light blue and some greens to 65, but the further you go in, the higher level they become. The mobs areound the enterance are a bit more spaced out and more easily single pulled instead of getting massive trains from bad pathing and proximity aggro. Its gonna be a good place for single groups to get xp of all levels...<p>Inny and the Maestro definately got heavy-duty upgrades. We didnt see inny but we did test Maestro extensively. The devs said hes being tuned to a 4-5 group all 65 encounter. They were still tweaking it but its gonna be similar to the Terris Thule encounter with a twist or 2. We had 6 groups avg lvl 63 and we wiped mutiple times trying to get the hang of it, so they have more tweaking to do.<p>Do not worry about the Hate revamp. I think youll like it.</b><p>Sounds promising. Currently the &quot;new&quot; Hate is coexisting with the old one on Test, but that may be for zone evaluation purposes only. Whether the old version of PoH will be kept around or not is unknown, though it seems unlikely. As long as the epic drops remain accessible from similar level mobs, making the minibosses and Inny himself more buff should present no problem--and lord knows level 65 folks could use more places to hunt for exp. It's also safe to assume that the inhabitants of Stormhammer will get the revamp first, but we'll see.<p>Now the team just has to come up with a roleplay reason for Innoruuk's sudden urge to redecorate.<p><BIG>Poe Sport</big><p>Casters Realm put up an <a href="http://www.crgaming.com/editorials/vieweditorial.asp?Id=129">article</a> about a visit to Sigil, the company founded by ex-Verant boss and EQ co-creator Brad McQuaid. The piece says virtually nothing--the company isn't leaking any details about whatever it is they're developing--except for one tidbit of note. It seems Lawrence Poe, former EQ spell guru and one of the devs on EQOA, has jumped aboard the Sigil boat.<p>Poe was fairly popular with casters, and the wizards at Graffe's are <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=25554.topic">commenting</a> that he'll be missed. Sigil is certainly drawing a good group of devs--maybe the deep pockets of Microsoft are singing a siren song. It will be interesting to see how much Brad's Vision (TM) affects the new game. In any case, we wish the Sigilians the very best of luck.<p>Hmmm, weren't the Sigilians in a ST:TNG episode or something? They had ridges on their foreheads, I think.<p><BIG>Scam Them All to Hell</big><p>Yet another <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=37997.topic">trap</a> to gain access to EQ accounts has recently surfaced, and this time there's some serious cash on the line. Some jackass devised a site called eqemail.com, which offers a free e-mail account to anyone who signs up. The trick is that he asks for an existing e-mail address, which he then tries to access using the password you entered for his site. If you're one of those people who tends to use the same password a lot, this gives him control of your main e-mail. Then he goes to the Station site and requests the username for the EQ account tied to that address, then requests the password. Boom, he takes control of your characters, strips them of items, and sells both the items and characters quickly, leaving you with nothing. Plus, the guy could clean out your PayPal account and the like as well.<p>Interestingly enough, Yantis (known for his site that sells items and accounts for cash, as well as for taking over ownership of various EQ message boards) is offering a $10,000 reward for info leading to the arrest of the scammer. Why? Maybe Yantis was a victim as well... his reward page is unclear on the matter.<p>Regardless of the motivation for the reward or who it's coming from, ten grand ain't bad. But the best reason for catching this dink is because he's ripping off innocent people. So hell, Mobhunter will tack an extra $10.43 onto that reward (it's all we could find in the couch cushions) and will happily beat the bastard with rubber hoses when he's caught.
