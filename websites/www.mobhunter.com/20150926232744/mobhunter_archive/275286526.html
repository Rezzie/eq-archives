In case you just tuned in, the spdat file contains spell data, so changes generally mean spells or item effects have either been added or modified.<p>The most significant additions are a version of <a href="http://dynamic2.gamespy.com/~planeteverquest/deq/cgi-bin/dumpeq.cgi?M=2?SpellID=2764">Summon Corpse</a> that doesn't require a coffin, a wizard <a href="http://dynamic2.gamespy.com/~planeteverquest/deq/cgi-bin/dumpeq.cgi?M=2?SpellID=2734">ability/spell</a> to send people to the Nexus in Luclin, and <a href="http://dynamic2.gamespy.com/~planeteverquest/deq/cgi-bin/dumpeq.cgi?M=2?SpellID=2767">Dragon Force</a>, which apparently is a Monk spell/skill that does a small amount of direct damage with a knockback effect. This could be very handy, assuming Verant doesn't make it some sort of 72-minute discipline--which would suck. Monks are already <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=16455.topic">babbling aimlessly</a> about the potential.<p><B>Angry Rogues, File Your Complaints Here</B><p>Also in this patch, one of the rewards from a Rogue quest in the Plane of Sky--the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/crystalmask.html">Crystal Mask</a>--was flat-out <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8467.topic">nerfed</a>. It used to insta-cast unlimited charges of invisibility, but now it casts Gather Shadows with a five-second casting time.<p>Rogues are pissed, as you'd imagine. But seriously, folks, the item was ridiculously overpowered, and rogues should probably have expected a nerf at some point, especially considering the changes to the <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/incarnadinebreastplate.html">Incarnadine BP</a> a few months back. Still, suggestions to change the effect so that it either had a cast time or was self-only are pretty valid. Expect to hear about this one for a while, as--despite their ability to assassinate--rogues have a hard time letting stuff die.<p><B>For Tailors with a Sweet Tooth</B><p>The nice guys and gals at <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/">EQ Traders</a> are back from FanFaire with some new tradeskill info. These folks tirelessly figure out oddball recipes and spend ridiculous amounts of time and platinum working on tailoring, tinkering, and blacksmithing. If you ever have *any* question relating to a trade skill, this is the place to go. Also, check them out if your avatar is craving <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=1189.topic">chocolate covered cherries</a>.<p><B>Ester Leaves Cave, is Frightened by Own Shadow</B><p>The mostly absent (as of late) Ester the Tester <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000358.html">returned</a> with a plea:<p><I>&quot;As we start to look beyond Luclin we would like to revisit all of our 'old world' quests. The amount of content in our game is a bit staggering so we would like to ask your assistance in finding the broken or incomplete quests.&quot;</I><p>What a dangerous request. Poor Ester is about to be flooded with e-mail from people who can't figure quests out and so believe them to be broken, seemingly unable to look up spoiler info on any of the myriad of sites dealing with that sort of thing. Oh well, a job's a job.<p><B>Making Mischief</B><p>Travelers around Norrath have <a href="http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheplaneofmischieffrm1.showMessage?topicID=528.topic">discovered</a> new mobs in certain zones (including Unrest) that seem to have something to do with entering the Plane of Mischief. This zone is currently underpopulated due to the <a href="http://www.knightsofthecreed.com/pom/run.htm">insane</a> extremes one must go to in order to enter it.<p>Is this a move to make Mischief accessible to more people? Should this zone receive more widespread use, or remain something of a &quot;reward&quot; zone (though arguably it isn't even this anymore due to recent nerfs)? You be the judge.<p><B>Time to Defend the Gates, My Friends!</B><p>Looks like a nasty <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=25796.topic">NPC</a> is terrorizing the populace of Freeport. A human female necro named Driana Poxsbourne roams the tunnels under West Freeport, and is apparently poking her head above ground and causing trouble. She's green to a level 41, but necro NPCs are notoriously tough for their level (shame the same cannot be said for their PC counterparts, eh? /tease).<p>Before every necro on my server challenges me to a duel, let me just say that Moorgard will be protecting the newbies of Freeport from this vile menace every chance he gets. I wish she was a dark elf, though, as they are so much more satisfying to kill.<p><B>If You Build It, They Will Use It to Invade Troy</B><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000356.html">returned</a> from FanFaire to post a follow-up on horses. He provided a link to the nearly obsessive <a href="http://www.innmates.com/~bhinder/eqhorse.jpg">diagram</a> that someone named Bhinder made.<p>If the Greeks had been this detail-oriented, Odysseus might have made it home sooner.<p>Absor also comments on the upcoming <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000353.html">UK server</a>. If you have an opinion on whether it should allow /movelog players or not, you'd best drop him a line.<p><B>Get Your Free Uberweapons Here... No, Don't... Yes, Do</B><p>Hey, remember that dwarf outside Sleeper's Tomb that was trading primal handwraps to monks with primal hammers and giving that godly 20/20 knight sword to pallys and SKs with primal warswords? Well, he <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=16417.topic">went away</a> for a couple days, but seems to be back after the patch. So if you were sweating about it, you can relax now.<p>Whew, that's a lot of news for such a small patch! Dorfs will try to use this opportunity to argue that good things come in small packages, but don't you believe them!<br>
