<html><head><title>Your Morning News Bagel</title></head><body><h1>Your Morning News Bagel</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-02-11</p><BIG>I Wonder If He Got to Keep His Flaming Sword</BIG><p>IGN posted an <a href="http://pc.ign.com/news/41526.html">interview</a> with Brad McQuaid last week, in which the once and former Avatar of Karana (who still plays EQ, btw) discussed how his new company plans to succeed in an increasingly crowded MMOG market:<p><B>By being one of the best, and by both expanding on the genre, taking it where it needs to go, as well as learning from the mistakes and failings of the first and second generation of these games. We are confident we've dialed in on some unique features that will drive this emerging industry forward. In other words, our intent is not to make an evolutionary game, nor to just take a few baby steps forward.</B><p>That's a fairly big promise. Brad is essentially saying that his next game will be a significant leap forward in the genre, not just <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com">an EverQuest imitator</a>. The other promising thing he mentions is that several major publishers are taking an interest in what he and Jeff Butler are doing--and with good reason. While EverQuest has gotten a facelift and a steady stream of new content, its engine will always have limitations. Sooner or later, the next big advance in gaming will draw players away from EQ. Whether Verant manages to do it with EQ2 (yes, they <B>will</B> have to release a sequel eventually) remains to be seen, but we at Mobhunter have to believe that Brad McQuaid stands the best chance of pulling it off.<p>The next couple years will be interesting, to say the least.<p><BIG>Beads Recalled--Mardi Gras Crowd Saddened, Stunned</BIG><p>A mage has <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=21752.topic">posted</a> over on Monkly Business that the spell Eye of Zomm has been changed on Test server such that the eye is no longer aggro to mobs that don't like the caster.<p>Why would someone post on a monk site about a level 8 mage spell? Because that spell happens to be the effect on one of the highest-priced items currently in the game: Holgresh Elder Beads. This trinket, which used to drop in the Wakening Land, became standard issue for l33t monks who pulled high-end mobs. Because the eye would grab the attention of the bad guys, monks could use this tool to gain aggro without having to endanger themselves as much as regular pulling would entail. This trick is especially useful in the north wing of ToV.<p>Monks have a split reaction to the news. Many are outraged, beside themselves with bitterness over what they see as yet another slight against their class. Other monks (most likely those who have never owned the beads) are pleased with the change, pontificating that monks shouldn't need such a crutch to do their job.<p>Arlos, a monk from <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/">Legacy of Steel</a>, has something of a philosophical view on the matter:<p><B>Will nerfing this spell make pulling NWing more difficult? Sure, there's some pulls that will be a fair bit more difficult actually. Will it really impede any good guild from slaughtering everything up there in 6 hours or less? No, not really. All it is going to do is like the safe spot change, increase annoyance value, without actually increasing difficulty.</B><p>On the other side of the coin, wizards (who also get the spell at level 8) are mostly <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=12655.topic">happy</a> about the change. They've wanted the eye to be non-aggro since beta, so that it could be used for the purpose for which it was presumably designed--as a scouting tool.<p>Personally, I hate to see a spell or item changed three years into the game. There's no question the current use of the spell (mostly through the beads) is clearly not what the designers intended. But this far into it, changing the rules on how something works is a bit suspect. I mean, Verant already stopped the beads from dropping--is this added move really so necessary? NToV has been cleared regularly for months and months, so why worry about making the change at this point?<p>From a design standpoint, perhaps Verant didn't have the ability to make the eye work as intended until now. Non-targetable NPC code wasn't introduced until Luclin, and maybe this was how they wanted it to work all along (something like a temporary familiar). Making the eye non-targetable would also affect the other classes that love Holgresh Elder Beads--necros and SKs. Despite the fact that eyes have about five hitpoints, these two classes can lifetap the eye to gain an essentially limitless supply of mana.<p>Basically, there's no solution that's going to make everyone happy. But if the change does go live, monks will just have to get used to dying more often, necros and SKs will have to find something else to tap, and NToV raids will take longer. Wizards and mages, meanwhile, can cast their eyes with glee and report to you exactly how many pickclaws are up in the Highkeep raider room.<p>In any case, you have about two days to unload your beads on some unsuspecting twink in GFay or EComm before the next patch. <I>Caveat emptor.</I><p><BIG>Welcome to the World of Planned Obsolescence</BIG><p>If you get a Best Buy ad in your Sunday paper, you saw that the latest video card, nVidia's GeForce 4 MX 440, was <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/detail.asp?e=11099087&amp;m=488&amp;cat=521&amp;scat=522">advertised</a> as on sale this week. With 64 megs of DDR RAM at a price of only $179, you might be shocked into running out and picking up this card as a replacement for your suddenly obsolete GeForce 3.<p>Don't be too hasty. Turns out the GeForce 4 MX line is, in a way, actually a step <I>backwards</I> in the effort to move video cards toward compatability with DirectX 8.1. Check out what <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1583">AnandTech</a> has to say on the matter:<p><B>More specifically, the GeForce4 MX features no DirectX 8 pixel shaders and only limited support for vertex shaders. The chip does support NVIDIA's Shading Rasterizer (NSR) from the original GeForce2 but that's definitely a step back from the programmable nature of the GeForce3 core.</B><p>This is not to say that the GeForce 4 MX isn't a great card for current game titles. It has a much improved anti-aliasing engine (AA is the feature you <I>must have</I> in a video card, period), a very neat transparency system called nView, and great framerates at high resolutions.<p>Disappointed? Don't be. At $179, this card is still a great deal for those with a GeForce 2 or older who are on a tight budget. And for those of you who need the true next generation card, you'll want to wait for the <B>GeForce 4 Ti 4600</B>. This top-of-the-line beauty has all the features of the MX line, adds in the missing shaders for true DirectX compatability, and sports 128 megs of RAM. While current games don't benefit all that much from the new chipset, <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1583&amp;p=12">benchmarks</a> using the engine of the upcoming Unreal 2 show impressive improvements with the new card. In other words, the Ti 4600 will really make tomorrow's games come to life.<p>Will the GeForce 4 make a night-and-day difference in your EverQuest experience? Until reviewers start using EQ as a benchmarking tool, we'll never know for sure. My guess, based on the evidence so far, is... probably not. As long as your video card is an upper-end GeForce 2 or better, you'll still get the best bang for your buck by upgrading your CPU and upping your RAM to 512 megs or more. If you demand the best of the best, of course, you don't have any choice but to upgrade. But if you have that much cash to throw around, feel free to send a little our way; the Ti 4600 will run you somewhere between $300 and $400.<p>All in all, not a bad start for your news week. Maybe Mondays aren't so bad after all.
