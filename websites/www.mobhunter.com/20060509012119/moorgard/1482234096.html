We Think</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000607.html">reports</a> that the comment system on Dev Corner is working once again. Also of note, as pointed out to us by a reader named Tyck, is that the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Technical+Help&amp;number=3&amp;DaysPrune=20&amp;LastLogin=">Technical Help</a> forum has reappeared, despite notice that it was <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000591.html">going away</a>. Are we to assume that this is a permanent thing, or just an artifact of a bad patch? While it gets a bit noisy in there, the forum is useful in many situations, so we're in favor of it sticking around.<p><BIG>Mostly Good Patch News</BIG><p>A number of subtle (or not so subtle, depending on your perspective) changes crept into Wednesday's patch, which are only now bubbling to the surface. Here's a few things from various message boards and tips from our readers:<p>- A nice new <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerpottery.showMessage?topicID=797.topic">pottery item</a> showed up that seems tailor-made for tradeskill folks (pardon the pun). No-rent bags make me nervous, though.<p>- In Ssra Temple, a mob called a Shissar Mystic is now dropping a couple heretofore unseen (in game, that is) <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=beb5a05d0d78b47a731e6ae184b8ed7e&amp;threadid=2493">shaman spells</a>--Acumen of Dar Khura (group acumen) and Primal Essence (mini-Avatar).<p>- A marginal beastlord-only weapon dropped by the Cursed in Ssra Temple was upgraded to be arguably the best current <a href="http://image.inkfrog.com/pix/Vesp/cursedweapon.JPG">monk weapon</a> in the game (not counting Vulak's drops at this point). It's so good, it's almost <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/CrimeBlotter/crimeblotter020612.html">a crime</a>.<p>- Though Stormhammer (the Legends server) is gaining the Jaggedpine Forest zone, they lost Marauder's Mire. Apparently the NToV-quality loot that was dropping for very little effort is no longer part of the $40 monthly fee.<p>Thanks to Eric, Martin, and Alukan for submitting some of the above newsbits.<p>Absor also <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000605.html">confirmed</a> something about NPC casters that players have been noticing--the need for NPCs to be in a player's line of sight to cast on them was not made live in the patch. Alan explains why:<p><B>We decided not to move that particular part of the changes Live. It was just too easy for PCs to take advantage of the line of sight change. NPCs aren't smart enough to overcome that advantage.<p>We're continuing to keep our eyes on the changes we've made, and we'll keep looking to make new ones.</B><p>Seems the mobs need to brush up on their strafing skills before the LoS change can be put into effect. When you think about it, though, we don't really want <I>all</I> spells to require a strict line of sight. Not being able to heal someone from around a corner would very nearly make the game unplayable.<p><BIG>You're Bound to Read This</BIG><p>Fippy Darkpaw, Verant's furry mascot, posted another <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/fippy_facts.jsp">Fippy's Facts</a>--this time giving stats on bind points. It's fairly interesting, as it shows most people stay bound near a starting city. Does this mean soulbinders are a bigger success than even Verant anticipated?<p>Other stats of note:<p><B>- The zones with the least people bound in are: Kurn's Tower, The Deep and Ssra's Temple. <br>- Over 1.5 Million people are currently bound in Greater Faydark. That is a lot of Elves! <br>- At this time, 8 suicidal people are bound in Sleeper's Tomb. <br>- 2800 people are bound on The Planes.</B><p>Maybe Fippy (or his human counterparts) could supply a similar list showing where level 60 players are bound. The differences would be interesting, I'm sure.<p><BIG>Stand-up Comics</BIG><p>For those who need a break from debating the recent changes to caster NPCs, <a href="http://gucomics.com/">GU Comics</a> provides a chuckle. What's more, the joke is at the expense of rangers and paladins--all the better!<p>See, nothing earth-shattering... nothing universe-altering... just a short news roundup to get you through the weekend. To all those who celebrate it, enjoy the holiday.<p>I miss you, Dad.<br>
