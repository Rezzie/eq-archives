<html><head><title>You Have Been Silenced</title></head><body><h1>You Have Been Silenced</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-06-19</p><BIG>The Long Road</BIG><p>Are you tired of flying all over the country going to FanFaires? Think it's about time Verant returned the favor and came to visit you? Well, you're in luck, because SOE has just announced the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/eqinvasion/">EQ Invasion Tour 2002</a>.<p>What the hell is that, you ask?<p><B>* The 2002 EQ Invasion will cover more than 10,000 miles of the US this summer. <br>* The tour kicks-off in San Diego, CA on June 21st and ends on/around September 13th in Boston, MA. <br>* The centerpiece of the 2002 EQ Invasion Tour is a modified v-nose cargo trailer. The EQ trailer is equipped with 13 Sony VAIO computers, 13 sound systems, and 1 world of Norrath.  <br>* The trailer license plate reads &quot;EVERQST&quot;. <br>* The EQ Invasion Trailer is over 26' long, 8' 10&quot; high, and weighs a whopping 3,415 lbs.</B><p>So this big trailer full of equipment is going to be tooling around, giving away prizes and letting you play EQ on some pretty fancy hardware. Where can you find it? Check out the snazzy <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/eqinvasion/flash_map/eqinvasion.html">map page</a> that shows you where and when the EQ-mobile will be in your area. You might win a free copy of EQ Classic, an Intel audio player, or some Altec-Lansing speakers.<p>Sounds like a pretty cool idea. My only concern is that the people in the van might just be some demo crew hired by SOE rather than actual Verant employees who really know the game. If the goal of the exercise is simply to draw attention to EQ and get some free media coverage, then anyone will suffice. If the plan is to do something nice for the players and have some fun with them (as in a FanFaire on wheels), then only real Verant staff will do.<p>We'll be the judge when the tour hits Minneapolis in August. Join the Mobhunter crew at the Mall of America and check it out with us. But if anyone besides me wins the speakers, I'm going to be pissed.<p><BIG>Also Known As 2:45</BIG><p>Absent for lo these many months, <a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/">Quarter to Three</a> has returned with a new batch of reviews, previews, and insight on the video game market. They even have the balls to say that Morrowind isn't the greatest things since sliced bread--blasphemy!!<p>Why would we be plugging a non-EQ site here? Because Quarter to Three has always proven to be very well-written and often quite <a href="http://www.landoverbaptist.org/news0602/scoobydoo.html">funny</a>. Smart sites are a good thing, so we give QtT a big thumbs-up.<p><BIG>Absor Turns the Tables on Us!</BIG><p>Here at Mobhunter, we naturally get a lot of EQ news from Absor's posts over on Dev Corner. Well, for a change it's Absor who's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000611.html">linking to us</a> by plugging our <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-1726225056">interview with Scott Hartsman</a>.<p>Yeah yeah, further proof that we're Verant's stooges... /yawn. I prefer to think of it as an example of the cyclical nature of the universe. Would have been nice if they had <I>spelled our name right,</I> of course... but I'm getting used to that.<p>This would also be a good time to mention that some of our readers posted the whole Hartsman interview on various message boards, which is something we don't want to encourage. We love it when people link to our stories and post quotes from them (after all, that's a lot of what we do here at Mobhunter), but we don't want our stories published in their entirety on other sites. We're not trying to be <a href="http://www.npr.org/about/linking_form.html">freaks</a> about it, but the idea is to bring readers here, you see. Besides, think of all the poor people who would be missing out on our witty photo captions! Your cooperation is appreciated.<p><BIG>Competition Heats Up</BIG><p>A great many people picked up <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/">Neverwinter Nights</a> today, which is Bioware's adaption of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe--the real one, not just another knockoff. While not massively multiplayer in nature (games are limited to 64 adventurers at once), this is a different breed of online RPG in that you can design and host customized adventures. The DM (Dungeon Master, duh!) can build the world and actively participate, leaving many of the mundane mathematical functions to the computer--which is exactly where they belong.<p>The graphics and effects look pretty impressive, and the draw of the D&amp;D universe will appeal to many. Word is that some folks at Verant and Mythic were already playing today.<p>If you've ever complained about a lack of content in an MMORPG, now's your chance to show them how it's done. But if your universe sucks, you've got no one to blame but yourself.
