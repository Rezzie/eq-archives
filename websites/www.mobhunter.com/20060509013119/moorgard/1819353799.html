Have a look at EQ's <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/interface/">new user interface</a> and be the judge as to whether the wait has been worth it.<p>Click around for yourself, but here are some of the highlights:<p>- Improved icons in the Spell Effects window. Positive buffs have a blue outline and debuffs have a red outline. Hmm, I wonder what outline spells like Torrent of Fatigue will have.<p>- Group window with Invite/Disband buttons very handy.<p>- Ability to split off any subset of the main Chat window into its own window. You can send all of guildchat to one window, all auctions to another, etc. Filtering specific types of chat is also much easier, thanks to cascading windowed menus.<p>- The Inventory window isn't startlingly different, but the layout is a bit more natural and the exp/AAXP bars are easier to read.<p>- Managing your custom hotkeys/macros will be much, much easier thanks to a layout that is 500% better than the clunky old method.<p>- All game options (sound, display, mouse, keyboard) are finally easy to get to without that stupid F10 cycling necessary before.<p>- A Pet window shows your pet's health, plus gives easy access to common pet commands. What's more, your health bar will also show your pet's health, even without the Pet window up. I'd wager that the combo pet/owner health bar is not visible to the group, though.<p>- Spell book pops up in a movable window via a single click on your spells bar. Dandy new spell icons abound, of course.<p>- Much clearer Training window, making raising skills at your guildhouse that much easier.<p>- No need to remember those pesky [Ctrl] commands to open and close certain windows. A Window Selector appears on screen, allowing you to click windows on and off to your heart's content.<p>The only thing I really wanted to see but didn't is the new Trade window. Nathan Pearce's Web team will hopefully add a screenshot of that very soon. It's also unclear how the /hitsmode command will be affected. I'd love to be able to stick <I>all</I> combat spam into one window, including NPC casting. Maybe if you peel off guildchat, ooc, auction, shout, etc. into separate windows, all you'll be left with is combat stuff. That would be okay. I'd also like all /tells to go into one window, and I can't quite figure out whether you can do that.<p>Overall, the new UI kicks ass. It makes the things you do everyday much simpler, and finally does away with the silly need to change screen resolutions that has been nagging users for over three years now.<p>Some will complain that the new interface isn't revolutionary enough. I'd argue that it doesn't have to be. A UI should be all about elegance and efficiency, and this one seems to fit the bill. There are some nice new toys included, but for the most part the UI just improves upon what you could do already.<p>But it isn't just the users who benefit from this improved interface. Verant's flagship title is still insanely popular, but it definitely needed a facelift. The new UI makes EverQuest look much more like a current game rather than one that was beginning to show its age. This dandy little interface should buy the company some time until EQ2 is finally ready to see the light of day.<p>There's no clear date yet for when the new UI will go live, but we're guessing it will be pretty soon. I, for one, am looking forward to it.
