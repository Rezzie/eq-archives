<h1 class="article_title">Riddles in the Depths</h1>
<p>by Loral on August 01, 2005</p>

<p>The war of Antonica rages on. While the elves stay close to home after the orcish attacks three weeks ago, Barbarian mercenaries and the Frogloks of Gukta battle against Ykesha's armies in the southern rathe mountains. Armies of barbarians marched from Halas to rathe Mountains where they battled Ykesha's forces from the south. Many adventurers were chewed to pieces in the upper and lower jaws of this huge battle. Some, however, found a trinket or two within the piles of corpses.</p>

<p>The quality of these items and the dubious methods by which they were acquired made people angry. Some worried that items of such a high quality reduced the value of the items rewarded in higher-end raid content. The random rewards and the short duration of this event, however, won't build any threat against consistent raiding with known loot.</p>

<p>Warlord Ykesha himself faced adventurers on the battlefield. When it became clear that he was not meant to be destroyed by mortal hands, these adventurers found other ways. They brought armies of Frogloks against him for hours until the sustained damage became even too great for the warlord. These adventurers sadly discovered that Ykesha's shield was little more useful than a cloth cap; less useful, in fact. Still, the look of such a shield is no doubt a prize in itself.</p>

<p>Now we see the trolls looking south to Gukta and <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/Absor.JPG">prophets of doom</a> already call the city lost. Let us all pray for our little green friends.</p>

</ul>

<p>Last Thursday EQ Stratics hosted another excellent <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/DoD/dodhoc.php">Developer's Chat</a>. More often that we'd like, dev chats don't give us a lot of news that us nosy website writers can't dig up on our own. The dev team likes to stay tight lipped on future efforts until they are sure they will occur. When announced, these new efforts usually show up on the EQLive forums rather than in a developer chat.</p>

<p>However, in this week's chat we received a lot of juicy detail on Depths of Darkhollow. Lets take a look.</p>

<p>Many Anguish-level raiders complained that Dragons of Norrath offered few raids at their power. It appears that Depths will include a significant number of raids aimed at players who have already finished Anguish. </p>

<p>I feel it is important to understand that not all raiders are of nearly the same power. Often raiders refer to themselves, other raiders, and raid targets as though they were all right around their same power. I have heard Qvic+ raiders state that true raiding doesn't begin until Qvic. I've heard Time raiders say that raiding means Time and above. Much like there are players of all levels, there are also raiders of all levels. Four Anguish level guilds may seem like a lot for a server, but there are hundreds of guilds on every server and dozens below Anguish who also want newer content.</p>

<p>However, when a guild defeats Anguish, there is nothing else out there to challenge them. Everyone below this power still has something ahead of them to defeat. That is probably the best reason why it is important that Depths include targets post Anguish to keep Anguish raiders happy.</p>

<p>This chat gave us a few more details about the "Play as a Monster" feature or as I like to call it - the Monster Mash. As we have heard, this feature is actually split into two parts: Spirit Shrouds, and Monster Missions. The Monster Missions will allow a group to switch into the bodies of monsters in order to complete a mission. Some of these missions will be flashbacks into the history of Everquest. </p>

<p>We learned from this chat that the monster missions will not have restrictions on the levels of the players who want to join them. This means that a group with a level 20, 34, 36, 54, 60, and 70 characters can all group together and go on a mission. Loot will be distributed based on your level. This is a huge improvement in the social features of this game. Now players can group with their friends regardless of class or level for these missions.</p>

<p>During Sprit Shrouding, a player can switch to a monster with a pre-defined class template of their level or below. During their time in a spirit shroud, players will earn items and experience as normal which will switch back to their main character. Spirit shrouding adds a whole new variable to the existing game. I can't wait to do the new Crushbone missions with a level 18 werewolf.</p>

<p>There will be normal missions in Depths of Darkhollow as well. The rewards for these missions will not be a point-based loot system. With Dragons, players focused on the missions that offered the best point rewards for the least effort, such as Creator or Gimblax. Depths missions will offer rewards to those seeking a variety of progressive missions instead of the those completing the same mission over and over. It isn't yet clear exactly how this will work or whether it will compete well against a point-based loot system for pickup groups.</p>

<p>New "Intelligent Items" will have many different abilities and will earn experience as characters do. Intelligent items can be acquired through regular hunting, raiding, or tradeskilling. They will have many personalities including cowardly, heroic, persuasive, or mocking.</p>

<p>If you purchase the retail version of Depths of Darkhollow you will receive a free Clockwork Boar mount. This may be the best retail purchase in-game reward yet. Over the years I have continually missed out on the retail rewards because retailers cannot keep up with my desire to play the expansion the minute it goes live. It looks like this year I may have to wait a day if I want that crazy clockwork boar!</p>

<p>It was a great dev chat and I look forward to the next one. In the meantime, let us look to our froggy friends to the south and wish them well.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Trigga on August  1, 2005 08:20 AM</strong></p>
<p>Since DoDH mostly consists of indoor zones won't the free Clockwork Boar mount be superfluous in most of the expansion?</p>

<p></p>

<p>(Just like half the druids spell book!)</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by:  on August  1, 2005 10:11 AM</strong></p>
<p>I beleive it was stated during fan faire, that while many of the dod zones appear to be indoors, most of them will be flagged outdoors.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Of course, they also stated that there are NO MORE MOUNTS coming, so that appears to be a bald faced lie.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on August  1, 2005 02:13 PM</strong></p>
<p>Can you pull up a quote where SOE said they would never add another mount?  I can't find one.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by:  on August  1, 2005 04:56 PM</strong></p>
<p>It wasn't a written quote, it was spoken during one of the roundtable or brunch thingies.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I specifically asked if we could ever get drake type mounts (flying/lev), and the reaction was no new mounts were ever going to be added, at least not until they ever got new player models.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: xsi on August  1, 2005 06:25 PM</strong></p>
<p>Is this where I chime in with a rant about player models?  /duck</p>

<p></p>

<p>Seriously, DoD(h) sounds interesting.  The war, on the other hand, has been a horrific experience for me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Thus ends my brief editorial.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Jyve on August  1, 2005 06:55 PM</strong></p>
<p>As for most content, what you got out of the war in enjoyment (if not loot) was what you put into it.</p>

<p>A great many people REALLY enjoyed the lore, the buildup, the battles, the consequences of what occured.  It was a concern on the nature of triggering the optional events (seriously, who ever thought of the hand ins to trigger to the level that was required without having feedback something was changing needs to think about using a mechanic like this again).</p>

<p>When things kicked off, it showed what can be done in the game.  It's been mentioned countless times that not alot changes in EQ, this event surely put that to bed, and with the EQforum detectives working as hard as they have, it shows the events that are likely to happen again when we've entered the Age Of War properly.</p>

<p>Yes, the loot to be earned was fairly free dropping, and KS'ers and Ninja's were out in full force.  Probably many of them not even realising why there's loot dropping!  But most people who had a chance at getting the drops were very civil to each other (at least on AB).  Small groups of idiots trying to sploit it for others will not cloud my judgement that this was a staggering event to behold.</p>

<p></p>

<p>12/10 for effort, 8/10 for implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Sunshadow on August  1, 2005 07:30 PM</strong></p>
<p>The War, other that being a talking point, is reallyonly a source of frustration. To the point where I am no longer participarting. The fact that the content is all high end, which precludes most people is the piont most people hate. I would have much rather seen a war that builds up from a lower level point. I mean where did crushbone ever get level 70+ orcs from, Bah. That bit of the war should have been level 30/40+ the rathe could have been 40/50+. Freerott could be 60+ with the final battles building to 70/raid.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sure the earlier event would have been farmed so the loot should have been scaled as such. But it would of been a lot more fun, had better participation and would have seen people actually fighting for the right side rather than just farming the captains for loot.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As to DoDH I think this will be great. Personally because I like to solo a lot cause i only get 30 min or so a day to play this will allow me to hit some of the easier solo content again. Sure the XP coversion may suck but I had much more fun in the 30'ies running around Overthere than I do now in POS. Another great thing will be organising lower end guild events, where all guild members can participate. I bet Vox and Naggy will need to be put on cycles again as most guild will now be able to shroud enough members to take them down.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Since the retail box probably won't even make it to Australia I doubt I will see this clockwork boar myself which is a shame. But still it is a nice reward.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: xsi on August  1, 2005 07:43 PM</strong></p>
<p>"12/10 for effort, 8/10 for implementation."</p>

<p></p>

<p>I would say 8/10 for effort, (I'm sorry... but SOME of the implementation issues go back to SOE simply not bothering to think things through... and I see that as a problem with effort), and 2/10 on implementation.</p>

<p></p>

<p>30 second delay on hand-ins.  Utter lack of anything beyond aforementioned hand-ins for low level players to do.  Huge problems with training and faction abuse.  Said trainers gaining access to high-end GoD or CoA-level items.  This was sloppy, pure and simple.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As for 'nothing ever happens in EQ', you're right... things are at least changing.  Unfortunately, much like when we were the b**ches of the Wayfarers, the players are once again pretty much meaningless in the grand scale of things.  Whatever happens, the frogs are getting kicked out, the trolls are retaking Grobb/Gukta/Grobb, and the set-in-stone timeline will continue.  I'm not sure being able to die and/or profit from these events is quite what players had in mind when talking about an interactive, evolving world.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I second that! I went to the Ferrot to see if I could get in on the action. Ahhh No. all were red and hit like trucks. Some others came and asked to group (they were lower than me.) I said no, I dont want to die 25 times in order to kill something only to have the loot stolen out from under me IF it drops. Very poorly thought out I believe.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I heard people in Rathe dying 30- 40 times! NOW thats FUN lol.</p>

<p>That's horrible. I cannot BELIEVE that they're giving us a mount after saying they wouldn't. They totally lied to their customers. It's a slap in the face!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Oh my god, SoE devs changed their mind.  What a slap in the face!  Sorry, but with a changing, evolving game, in an evolving, changing industry, SoE not being willing to change, and adapt would be a much larger slap in the face.  If you want to get upset about something, try and find something actually important.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on August  2, 2005 07:13 AM</strong></p>
<p>I believe friend Maitreya was being sarcastic =)</p>

<p></p>

<p>I don't remember them saying no more mounts but either way I don't think its something to get bent out of shape about.  It disappoints me that the mount will be a box-reward only instead of something purchasable in-game.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by:  on August  2, 2005 12:26 PM</strong></p>
<p>Good point was raised earlier about it being scaled up, that there should of been things for lower level people todo, then scaling up to the high end battles.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Thing is, there was...</p>

<p></p>

<p>Lvl 20 characters could go to Crushbone and kill the new DE's that appeared for loot (lvl appropriate stuff/xp potions) to help start the Faydark battle.  Mid levels could do the 3rd gate Necromancer quests (at least part of them, some required nadox drops, low level Planes drops, though I bought mine in Bazaar, so with the Guk drops, this could of been done solo around lvl 35).  I did this as my main and got a Greater XP potion, though it was reported that rarely some people got some very nice items from the hand ins.</p>

<p>There was the content for all levels funnily enough, it's just that MOST people only saw the battles.  Ok, I've also heard it said that 'how were we supposed to know about all this?'.  If you zoned into Neriak FQ, a guard sent you a tell by just being in the zone for a minute to go see the Necromancer GuildMaster and ask 'what project'.  You then got the first task, which was to go collect Undead Froglok Tongues, (Very easy of course, once again, a mid level group would of had no problems with this).  After the hand ins of the tongues, you then got the new tasks.  These were brilliant, 3 tasks, appearing in the task window, with multiple steps to work through.  Exactly how the rest of the stuff should of worked.  This is my main complaint about this whole war thing, there were some excellent parts to it, just not carried on through the whole event.  I can see why, sheer time pressures and the limited ability to test the thing to tune it.  </p>

<p></p>

<p>Looking back on it, I wish I'd of ran round a few more city zones to see what other quests would of been available from the different factions.  This is where we messed up a fair bit on AB, we didn't get alot of the sub-quests done.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Overall, I REALLY enjoyed this event.  The main part of it being, I was discovering stuff that was new.  I had the chance to find new Npc's/quests/loot that wasn't written up and commented to death on Alla/rpgexpert/guildBoards.  IT WAS NEW!  That feeling of the unknown, where's it all heading to, I REALLY enjoyed it.  </p>

<p></p>

<p>Downsides was this issue that no-matter how much I was into it, who I'd talked to, what quests I'd done, what faction tricks I could do, when it all came down to triggering the next part of the battles, I had to create a level 1 toon just to get the hand ins done.  My main character would just sit back and be unable to contribute any more (well, apart from farming Nadox for weapons).</p>

<p></p>

<p>This kinda leads on into another reason it didn't do well. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Quests (events) that require multiple steps by differing groups are going to be difficult to get working.  Normally, most events would be triggered by a single group/raid to get things done.  I think this is the first event that required such a large amount of people, that even a single guild going flat out would have problems getting it going all the way through.  It took many people working together, even cross server for information sharing, that it was always going to be a risky situation.  Co-ordinating that many people for quests/farming/hand ins was a large task, that of course was made even more difficult by no-one knowing for sure what would happen by their actions.  It was very hard to drag people from PoK to help with hand ins when they'd ask 'well, how many do we need to hand in? for how long? and what'll happen? and are you 100% sure this is the trigger?'    It's a good point...</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Ok, another good point was made, scores for effort, true, maybe should of been lower as testing appeared not up to snuff, but for Scope of Vision then, 12/10.  Implementing an event that spanned the whole of the old world, that changes the face of Norrath forever, and for getting as many people involved (for good or bad!).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Hope lessons have been learned well from this whole event to then go on and do more of this scale.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Maitreya on August  2, 2005 12:45 PM</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I was being sarcastic. Heh. If you scroll up some, someone said SoE told a "bald faced lie." I was just flying with that and poking some fun at that "slap in the face" crowd.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As for the event, I loved it. I think, however, that many would have liked it more if there were more dynamic changes other than the trolls taking their home back and if these varied from server to server.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For example, if the barbarians won the Rathe Mountains battle on a certain server, they would set up camps in Rathe to keep the ogres and trolls from marching that way and attacking the Karanas, Qeynos or Halas. The barbarians would become a permanent addition and would have levels appropriate for Rather Mountains mobs. Maybe add a few dark elf and troll corpses as parts of the scenery, and have existing NPCs talk about the battle a bit.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On a server where the armies of Ykesha won, the opposite would happen. Camps of trolls and dark elves would set up to defend Oggok and Grobb from invaders from Qeynos and Halas. Barbarian corpses could be found scattered about Rathe Mountains and the locals would still talk about the battle.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That sort of thing.</p>

<p>Seems like a piece of shit expansion to me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I failed to find any part in your text body where the class balance changes were announced and funded.</p>

<p>Seems like SoE is maxing their efforts for great sales again, while ignoring the playerbase.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Maitreya on August  3, 2005 02:21 PM</strong></p>
<p>Ignoring the playerbase? How so? By giving us things many of us have been asking for, like a play as a monster feature, a mentoring type system or more missions?</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on August  3, 2005 03:02 PM</strong></p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that "Everquest: Class Balances of Norrath" wouldn't sell real well.  There have been many patches so far that have delt with some of the class balance problems but I feel that anyone who had serious class balance issues won't be happy no matter what SOE does.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the mean time, I can't wait to play a Werewolf in Crushbone.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Maitreya on August  4, 2005 12:57 AM</strong></p>
<p>I just thought of 2 more uses for the Spirit Shroud.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It will be great for players who regret not "smelling the roses" on their way to 70. How many people have actually hunted in ALL of the dungeons in Norrath at the appropriate level? With the Spirit Shroud, you can shroud down and visit all those dungeons you missed at the right level without having to roll an alt.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Second, with the spirit shroud, we'll never have to farm greenies again. Let's say a high level player decides he wants to be liked in Cabilis. The easiest way to raise Cabilis faction is turning in tons of bone chips to Trooper Mozo in Field of Bone, and Kurn's Tower is probably the best place for bone chips. Today, that player would have two options: 1) spend plat in the bazaar to buy them or 2) spend an hour farming greenies. With the spirit shroud, he could shroud down to 15 or so and hunt in Kurn's tower, getting the bone chips he needs AND experience.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If it's half as cool as it sounds, the Spirit Shroud alone would be reason to buy Depths.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on August  4, 2005 11:11 PM</strong></p>
<p>It was on mine.  Being able to hunt with your friends regardless of level is an excellent addition to the game.  Ask players what they want and they'll say "something with +350 hitpoints on it".  Give it to them and they quit.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Asking what players want is the reason that both EQ2 and WoW became primarily solo games.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Lythian (aka Eclat) on August  4, 2005 11:39 PM</strong></p>
<p>Actually Loral, I have to disagree with you there.  I primarily play EQ2 but as an old time EQ player I like keeping up with the news on Mobhunter.  What I disagree with is that EQ2 is a primarily solo game.  Sure, there is TONS of solo content.  But much of the game cannot be done without a group.  Each time I have hunted recently I have hunted in a group and been grouped within minutes of lfg-ing.  EQ2 is what you want to make it- solo or group.  And while it is easier to solo, it is and always will be more rewarding (in every sense) to group.</p>

<p>Yeah, Eclat.  I knew I wasn't exactly being fair when I wrote that but it has still been my experience so far in both games that the huge amount of solo content has pushed people away from finding groups.  That's probably a whole other debate.</p>

<p>Don't kid yourself or others, Loral. If it didn't matter you wouldn't be preaching that same story over and over and over about casual vs raider balance...</p>

<p>Just to recap EQ is a progression game. Remove progression and you remove a LOT of the purpose in EQ. Fun is fine. Fun is good. Fun goes hand in hand with purpose. If EQ purpose was to collect a bilion lilies, you'd better leave the lilies around. Whatever the mechanism in it, you better not screw around with it as if it didn't matter or being casual about it. p</p>

<p>That sounds remarkably like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Progression is critical to Everquest. Without tangable progression, people will quit. Watching our characters grow in strengh and power keeps us coming back. We enjoy watching our characters improve. We like seeing numbers go up as we equip new items. We like destroying foes as easily as they once used to destroy us."</p>

<p>I am also curious as to what type of weapons we will be able to use when spirit shrouded? As a caster I don't carry weapons but will I need them if I shroud into a tank mob or will I be restricted to "Natural Weapons"? If I can use weapons and armor then I am going to need a heap more bank slots.</p>

<p>If MMOs were mostly about solo, then guilds wouldn't really need to exist. Nor would the social interraction be so important.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Yet they are.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Which makes me think that what VOCAL soloers asked ISN'T what MMOs are about and probably nor what is good MMOs anyway.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And to go back to other topic: Loral, it matters that the carrot exists, much less how far of it is. Headroom isn't a novel concept. It mattered how one communicate about the above mentionned carrot. It always did. Be it THE VISION or whatever coherent view a company upholds about it's game. Nothing new here. But there is very disctinct differences in the ways SoE has communicated about it, during and after VI times. Currently DEVs communicate a lot but some are very awkward about it.</p>

<p>Sunshadow: I believe it's been said the monsters have their own equipment when shrouded.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Maitreya on August 10, 2005 12:54 AM</strong></p>
<p>So, frogloks can be necromancers, shadow knights and rogues now.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Sunshadow on August 11, 2005 09:47 PM</strong></p>
<p>Will I be able to shroud into a level 15 tank mob, get a temp and a few DS buffs and head to PC and ding every 5 minutes all the way up to level 70? Also can you get AA experiance while shrouded?</p>

<p>what is the actual reason for sony only making this clockwork boar available to people who get retail box set ?? basically im in the UK, so now if i want this boar, im going to have to wait until game is available here ?</p>

<p></p>

<p>i thought digital downloading was cheaper for sony ? shouldnt they be encouraging people to get software that way, instead of discouraging them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>guess i will have to wait for boxed set and not play in the new expansion until then, sigh.</p>

<p>On a totaly different subject, I was reading this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=723&Itemid=2">http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=723&Itemid=2</a></p>

<p></p>

<p>and saw this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Is it a game?</p>

<p>It's a SERVICE. Not a game. It's a WORLD. Not a game. It's a COMMUNITY. Not a game. Anyone who says, "it's just a game" is missing the point.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Yes it is cheaper for Sony to do digital downloads.  It is also more convenient for everyone involved.  However, Sony also wants to keep EverQuest boxes on the shelves of Best Buy and the Web at EB Games.  This is a form of advertising.  The /claim items are a way to appease the retail merchants, who basically would have no reason to stock EQ if it were cheaper and more convenient to simply download the game.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: mac173173 on August 12, 2005 03:46 PM</strong></p>
<p>I think the problem for the UK and Aussie players (as well as those in other countries) is that even with the /claim items, stores are not stocking the game. Many players have complained that the game does not show up in the UK and elsewhere till months after release, and they have to pay hefty shipping and import taxes, way beyond the levy on the digital download.</p>

<p>free gargoyle spirit shroud if you download the new expansion</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Maitreya on August 13, 2005 03:31 PM</strong></p>
<p>The gargoyle shroud is only if you pre-order the download. However, you also get it with a box. The only way to NOT get the gargoyle is to download the expansion after it's live.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on August 14, 2005 04:45 PM</strong></p>
<p>That Raph's Rules article was always interesting for us armchair game designers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Expansions have always created a big jump in player numbers for the game overall.  The numbers begin to go down slowly after an expansion release and then jump up at the time the expansion is released.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I remember hearing people talk about another game's free-release expansion, one that was download only and didn't cost any money and aparently it didn't help them gain any more players as a pay expansion would have.  Part of that is probably marketing - New boxes on shelves help sell not only the expansion but the full game itself.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So SOE needs to get boxes on shelves but they need to give retail stores an incentive to carry it and and that means giving an incentive to the players who buy it at store.  Obviously for most of us its easier and cheaper to buy the downloaded version so they have to put something out there so I will get in my car and battle Beltway traffic to get to a stupid Best Buy and buy the expansion two days after I could have downloaded it.  It sucks, but that's business.  This is the first time the incentive was enough to get me to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by:  on August 14, 2005 06:47 PM</strong></p>
<p>well money is no problem for me, so   let me download it, and later on   buy the boxed set, i could then enter some sort of code to get the stupid boar,  then sony gets money from me nice, shrug, i dont care, i just dont like to wait for stuff lifes too short.</p>
