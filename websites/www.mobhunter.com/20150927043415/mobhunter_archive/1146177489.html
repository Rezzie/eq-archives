<html><head><title>Patch Preview 'Pectacular</title></head><body><h1>Patch Preview 'Pectacular</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-06-04</p><BIG>Cards on the Table Time</big><p>We were told last time SOE posted their <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp">Upcoming Updates</a> page that we'd be hearing more details on June 4. Sure enough, today saw an updated Updates page (which sounds redundant, when you think about it) with some fairly major changes that will be showing up in next week's patch on June 11.<p>There really isn't anything shown that a regular Mobhunter reader or browser of message boards wouldn't know about already, but some nice changes are coming nonetheless. Rather than copy the entire text, we'll give you the highlights:<p><UL><LI>The Nurga/Droga revamp that has been on Test a while will move to Legends. The former will be targeted at level 40-50 players, the latter is for 50-60.<p><LI><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=56432">Veksar</a> will be opened up on the live servers.<p><LI>Group exp bonuses are going in, and the experience range for 61-65 folks is being expanded.<p><LI>Two slots of shared bank space will be added to swap items between characters on the same account.<p><LI>PoP zone access changes will be implemented, meaning flags are going away for Decay, Honor, Valor, Storms, BoT, and Torment. No word yet if Torment will be made not to suck so much.<p><LI>DoT spells will report their damage to the caster with every tick.</ul><p>Additionally, casters will see several major changes. First, descriptions will be added to spells to give people a better idea of what each does. Second, right clicking on an empty spell gem will open up a category tree that lets you track down the spell you want and memorize it without opening your book. Finally, right clicking on your spellbook will open up a <A HREF="http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=18311.topic">spell favorites</a> menu that lets you save multiple spell configurations. This will make memorizing spells after death much easier, as well as swapping spells around for different purposes (raids, groups, soloing, etc.).<p>Also, a whole bunch of changes designed to make life easier on new players will be showing up:<p><B>...we are adding a Tradeskill tag to items that are used as components in trade skill recipes. To help guide new characters, Guildmasters will take a more active role in helping out new recruits by directing them to some starting points for quests. There will be even more quests in the newbie zones, most of them revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even the grandest cities. In addition, NPC merchants as well as other notable folks will have a title that will explain what their jobs are.</b><p>Aside from the newbie additions and the spell favorites thing, we knew all this stuff was coming. Interestingly, I've heard some old-school casters complain that the category tree dumbs down the game too much for their tastes, but they <A HREF="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=26784.topic">really like</a> the favorites. Clearly the EQ team took a page from the PlanetSide squad, as that game has a rather nifty feature that allows you to save favorite armor/weapon configurations for easy recall.<p>(On a side note, I'll be posting a review of PlanetSide sometime soon. It's a pretty intriguing game--despite the fact that I seem to get slaughtered about once a minute.)<p>Anyway, the <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/future_plans.jsp">Future Plans</a> page was also updated, and it proves to be another hefty read. More changes sometime down the road include:<p><UL><LI>Partial zone revamps of The Deep, Howling Stones, Dragon Necropolis, Sirens Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, Cazic-Thule, and Velketor's Labyrinth. These are along the lines of the improvements to Nurga, Droga, and Veeshan's Peak. Since they don't require a complete artwork overhaul, they seem to be able to do these relatively quickly.<p><LI>Updated character descriptions during the creation process. Uh, yeah, they're just a <I>bit</i> out of date.<p><LI>A new class of focus effects for DoT spells.<p><LI>Some item upgrades for things that drop in tier 2 and 3 PoP zones. You know, so uberguilds will be tempted to go back and slaughter all that lower-level content in their free time.<p><LI>The ever-popular melee balancing idea will be addressed. Honest.<p><LI>Block might be added to shields, or there may be some other way to make the use of shields more desirable.<p><LI>Failures on trivial tradeskill recipes might go away. But they might not. But they might. Really.</ul><p>There are a few new tidbits on the list, but nothing that's going to blow anyone away. Still, when even the <A HREF="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=18830">necros say SOE is making positive changes</a>, they must be doing something right. But I'm not sure why they want to revamp the already revamped CT, unless it's to take out the annoying AE slows and enrages that so many mobs have there.<p>Honestly, the biggest issue on the table is a successful solution to the class balance problem. Zone revamps and interface candy are nice and all, but no single topic impacts as many players as the current class disparity. It's good that the devs are taking their time to get it right, because if the payoff isn't there you're going to see a lot of angry players. Not that you won't anyway, of course, because players get angry about everything--but we mean a <I>lot</i> of players.<p>In any case, knowing a week in advance what's coming is going to make patch days a little anticlimactic. SOE is trying to steal my thunder! It's a good thing there's an endless stream of bugs and complaints to write about, or we'd be out of business.<p><BIG>I Guess Somebody Found Them</big><p>It has been pointed out that EB Games is offering a <A HREF="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=235859">pre-order</a> for the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion. But then EB is notorious for happily taking your money long before a real release date is known. In fact, I can pretty much guarantee you that EB is way off in this case.<p>Why? Because the listed ship date is 9/30/03--a mere two days after <A HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/">Chicago FanFaire</a>. The team won't be anywhere close to sober enough by then to launch a major expansion. I'd suggest waiting until sometime in October to actually release the product.<p>The EB page also gives this little tidbit on some of the included features:<p><B>The story that began in Broken Skull Rock now yields new clues about an event threatening to change the face of Norrath. Hunt for long-hidden artifacts of power from forgotten dungeons, secret catacombs, and long-buried ruins. A mystery is unfolding and a new age of exploration and adventure has begun! <p><UL><LI>Focus on single group content<br><LI>New technology with an emphasis on personalized encounters<br><LI>Environments catering to a wide variety of play styles<br><LI>Hundreds of new quests<br><LI>Legendary dungeons filled with undiscovered horrors, items and fame<br><LI>Powerful new spells for all casting classes</b></ul><p>Pretty vague, but you can't expect a lot at this point, since there hasn't been an official press release on the product yet. If the focus on single group content proves true, the expansion could appeal to high-level folks who aren't in uberguilds storming around the elemental planes and Time. I'm sure we'll be hearing some official news on LDoN fairly soon.<p>Gee, something is threatening to change the face of Norrath again. Funny how that seems to happen every 6-12 months or so.<p><BIG>Uber U Back in Session</big><p>For those keeping track, <A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">Afterlife</a> continues to make progress in Plane of Time, having cleared the last member of the first set of gods and moved on to the next. Some pretty impressive stuff is dropping with a lot of all/all tags on it. Welcome to NToV 2.0--or is that VT 2.0? Anyway, it's worth noting that to take advantage of some of those new melee effects, folks might have to give up vengeance and other goodies in those slots. Oh, the tough choices those poor Time dwellers have!<p>By the way, <A HREF="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/">Legacy of Steel's page</a> has finally gotten an update, notable not so much for the mobs they kill but rather for the arrival of another one of Tork's tales of genital misadventure. I'm convinced the Coen brothers should do a movie about him, if they can get Billy Bob Thornton to play the part of the hairless bard.
