It drops in Velks and currently can't be used by anyone due to a bug.<p>Something changed with the Sullon Zek <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000257.html">points system</a>. Don't ask me what, because trying to keep up with that thread gives me a headache.<p>The will be no ogre monks on the upcoming <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html">roleplay server</a>. &quot;But you're ruining my roleplay experience!&quot; Shut the @#$% up.<p>In the &quot;why didn't anyone ever think of this before?&quot; department, a reader suggested that spells tell you what <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000258.html">component</a> they need. Lawrence Poe thinks it's a good idea, but he's too busy <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000252.html">nerfing monk armor</a> to make the change right now. Hopefully soon.<p>Finally, <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000256.html">threads</a> needed for the Coldain shawl quest were made nodrop in the last patch, which is apparently as intended. Which means there will either be hundreds of these threads rotting in the upper ramps of Velks or hundreds of n00bs begging for threads from the exp groups killing there.<p>That'a about all the thrills I can take right now. For real excitement, go see a <a href="http://www.planetoftheapes.com/">movie</a>. Big thumbs up from this monkey.
