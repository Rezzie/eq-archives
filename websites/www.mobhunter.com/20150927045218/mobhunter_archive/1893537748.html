There was downtime this afternoon for about an hour, which resulted in yet another patch message:<p><B>June 5th, 2002   3:00 pm<br>------------------------------<p>** Emergency Patch **<p>- Fixed the zone between Iceclad and Eastern Wastes.<br>- Fixed the firepot room in Timorous Deep.<br>- Updated a handful of zones to fix a problem with NPCs spawning in the wrong place.<br>- Fixed the graphics cache issue that was causing characters' inventories to appear with the wrong item icons. <br>- The petition queue is now working as it should be.  (The delays some of you might have experienced with your petitions this morning should be reduced dramatically.)<p>We are aware of the following items, but are not able to fix them at this time:<p>- The skiff is broken in Erudin<br>- Corpse resurrection timers aren't decrementing while people are offline<p>** Previous Patch Update **<p>We fixed these items in the original patch, but forgot to mention them.<p>- Familiar Link Death issues<br>- Moving traps<p>We're sorry for the downtime.  Thanks for your patience.<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>Issues that were taken care of include the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/023824.html">firepot room</a> in Timorous Deep not taking travellers to their proper destiations, and the fact that some folks found themselves zoning from the bridge in Iceclad Ocean into East Freeport instead of Eastern Wastes. That's quite a trip.<p>The patch didn't totally fix the scary <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=5318.topic">graphics glitch</a> listed in the patch message. If you looked at your inventory, you likely found your item icons completely wrong, to the point that it was virtually impossible to locate anything. Many players also had mouse cursors become nearly invisible. To fix it required you to quit EQ, go into options and turn off texture caching, delete all the texture cache files, turn caching on again, then log back in. Fortunately a graphics .dll showed up in the evening that rendered the deletion of those files unnecessary. Making players erase multiple files from their EQ directory is a bad idea.<p>It's unknown whether the NPC spawning issues in the patch message referred to a problem with the <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=5084.topic">Angry Goblin/Warlord</a> spawn for the Chardok ring/chord quest. Be careful if attempting this quest right now, as it could result in a loss of items.<p>More downtime was destined to follow, of course, with yet another patch on the way:<p><B>On Thursday, June 6th, at 3AM PDT, (11AM GMT), all servers will be brought down for a brief patch. The estimated downtime is 2 hours.</B><p>According to a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000598.html">note</a> from the EQ Team that Absor passed on to us, these are the issues the Thursday patch is supposed to address:<p><B>We got a few of our focus effects crossed up in this patch, and will be patching servers tonight at 3am PST to fix this issue. The same items will have a focus effect on them, but in some cases we assigned the wrong focus type to a given item. We'll be updating them in tonight's patch, so you might want to hold of on any expensive trades until after the patch since the effects on items may change slightly.</B><p>While most casters are pleased with the addition of focus effects (Graffe's is keeping a running <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=17129.topic">list</a> of them), some have <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=17163.topic">pointed out</a> flaws in the selection of which effects go on which items. Others <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=17171.topic">complained loudly</a>. Still others <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=27516.topic">took it personally</a>, and hoped to send Verant a <a href="http://www.kissmyass.com/humor/translation.cfm">message</a> of their own. It's doubtful that everyone will be happy even after some of the corrections in the Thursday patch, but then again, some folks probably wouldn't be happy unless they logged in to find that every piece of their armor had a free effect on it.<p>Not all is doom and gloom, of course. Mages were <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=5326.topic">pleasantly surprised</a> to find some of their pets were enhanced in other ways besides being more obedient. Apparently the level 52 and 58 fire pets are now smarter, casting useful spells rather than simply meleeing most of the time. Perhaps this change is tied in to the mention in Wednesday's original patch message that caster NPCs would make better decisions when it comes to casting spells. Or maybe Verant just wanted to see if it was possible for mages to be happy, ever.<p><BIG>I Slaw the Light</BIG><p>Rich Waters, busy guy that he is, took a few minutes to pass on some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000597.html">details</a> about the Protection of the Cabbage quest:<p><B>If you are not a Druid and you've completed the Protection of the Cabbage quest, go and speak with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove - She's more than happy to give you something you'll be able to use instead of Xanthe's Earring.</B><p>There's a lot more stuff in the thread about what to do if you lose items in the quest, but it gets a bit wordy. If you're thinking of doing the cabbage thing, definitely check it out.<p><BIG>Video Killed the Radio... Umm, Dragon</BIG><p>In case you didn't attend the E3 show, you can check out some <a href="http://www.4gamer.net/patch/cool/main_e3_2002.html">video clips</a> for various titles, including Planes of Power and EQ2. Medik was chasing after me for a while now to watch these videos, and I'm very glad I finally did.<p>These narrated tours provide some insight into what to expect in PoP, and you'll see quite a lot of the Planes of Knowledge and Tranquility. The narration mentions the inclusion of &quot;virtual areas&quot; in some of the zones, where a quest or NPC might take you and your group to a place where you need to complete some certain task or kill a particular bad guy. This area will be unique to your group--other players can't join you--so the encounter can truly be tuned for six people. Multiple instances of this virtual area might be spawnable so that different groups don't need to compete for content. A welcome concept indeed. Be sure to check out the third clip--it includes some absolutely <I>badass</I> fight sequences with Solusek Ro and the new particle system.<p>The EverQuest 2 video will make you wet yourself. Literally. For everyone who, like me, looked at those screenshots and said they couldn't possibly be real... prepare to have your mind blown. The animations and effects in this game are beyond stunning. I realize I'm babbling like a freak right now, but just go look at the detail on the player characters and their armor. Be sure to wear an extra pair of Depends, though.<p><BIG>Better Late Than Never</BIG><p>GameSpy has just posted a <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/june02/eqlegends/">review</a> of the Legends service, including interviews with several actual players on the Stormhammer server. Why it took so long to do this review I have no idea, as Legends has been around for months now. I guess it's as good a time as any to evaluate whether this &quot;premium&quot; server is worth forking out the cash.<p>To GameSpy's credit, it's not a complete fluff piece. They did talk to at least one player who's not totally happy and who plans to leave the server. The author didn't seem to really draw any conclusions about whether Legends is worth the price or not, and I doubt any nay-sayers are going to be won over, but the article is worth reading.<p>They even interviewed an ex-guildmate and FanFaire drinking buddy of mine, Grumpee. Thankfully for the reader, GameSpy must have hired a team of copy editors to clean up his responses, because I've never known Grumpee to write a complete sentence, let alone make sense in an interview. gRumpEe'S seNtncEz uSulY lOOk liKe tHIs. /wave Grump<p>Okay, that's enough for now. Keep your fingers crossed that we won't have another day of patch mania.
