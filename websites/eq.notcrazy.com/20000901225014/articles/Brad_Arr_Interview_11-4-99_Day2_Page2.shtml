<font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> Have you had a chance to try out Asherons' Call yet? <P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> Absolutely<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> How do you think EQ compares to it?<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> Well, no comment. It's always been my personal and professional policy not to comment on the competition. I wish them the best. I have a lot of respect for anybody who's out there who wants to make a game like this and everyone will approach these games slightly differently, trying to appeal to, perhaps, a slightly different audience, and I wish them all the best. It really is up to the players out there to decide and they should go wherever their gaming needs are being met.<P>

---------------<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> I know there have been a lot of complaints about abusive GMs and well, just general complaints that they've unprofessional and abusive. What steps has Verant taken to help try to resolve this problem?<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><a href="http://eq.notcrazy.com/articles/eqncbrad6.jpg" target="_new"><img src="http://eq.notcrazy.com/articles/eqncbrad6.jpg" height="146" width="195" align="right" border="0"></a><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> Well, we take any reports of abuse very seriously. We investigate it. It’s definitely not something that we are going to tolerate. That said, there are always going to be problems in any kind of customer service organization like this. We try to find out what exactly happened, what the problem was and try to resolve that with both the player and the GM. And like I said, you know, we're not going to tolerate it. Our GMs, should, at all times act professionally and they should treat our customers with respect. You do have to keep in mind however, that it is a little bit different than the "customer service" you get when you go into a retail store, because there, in a sense, the customer is always right.  Whereas in EverQuest, in a game like this, the collective group of the customers is always right. In other words, we always have to act in the best interest of the game as a whole, which sometimes means flat out saying "no" to the customer.  And some customers, I think, aren't accustomed to being told "No".  Typically, you never tell a customer "no", but in the sense that we have to preserve the integrity of the game as a whole for our entire customer base, sometimes that is necessary.  But, again, that should always be done in a professional manner. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that our customer service will continue to get better and better, and we deal with all allegations like that very seriously, but there will always be, I think, in these games, reports that something didn't go right from the players perspective, because they didn't get their way. And we try to minimize that and keep everyone as happy as possible. It’s kind of like, you know, you're playing D&D at home with your friends and you get upset at the dungeon master because of something that went down. Know what I mean? Situations like that are sometimes inescapable. But I will say that we continue to do periodic polls. We recently did a poll as to how people felt about customer service, I think a couple months ago. And the vast majority were happy and content with our customer service, but not everybody was, so we have a goal, and that is better and better customer service.<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> What kind of new music tracks are you planning to put into the expansion, i mean, like, how many new ones are you going to be putting in?<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> Undecided at this point.<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> Any ideas as to possibly putting it on an audio CD?<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> That's been talked about. There's a lot of little things like that that we'd like to do. It’s starting to become a little more popular with some of the games, whether they're console games or PC games, the ones that have a real strong soundtrack to see that there's a separate product. I'd love to see all sorts of EverQuest related stuff, whether it’s soundtracks or toys, t-shirts, or what have you. So it’s safe to say that we, 989, and Sony are looking into that. We'd love to offer something like that, but there’s nothing yet really solid that we can commit to.<P>

---------------<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> What kind of new technologies does the expansion pack use? Like the motion blur and the t-buffer on the voodoo4. <P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> Basically what we're doing is pushing the existing engine harder. We are making some modifications to the engine, but it’s still the same engine. The engine had a lot more potential that we were earlier unable to take advantage of for two reasons. 1. You can’t go too far beyond in the terms of system requirements, and we had to look at what we believed the majority of our user base when we launched, what their systems would look like in terms of CPU and 3D Card and memory. There were a lot of features that we actually put into the engine say 3,6,8 months before we launched that just the programmers were working on and we did not have the time to take advantage of to the extent that we wanted to before we shipped. An example would be a lot more things were animated. We were able to animate a lot more things in the world towards the end. And we weren't able to take advantage of that to the degree we wanted, so going into the expansion we will be able to take advantage of that. But in terms of going into the engine and making some serious changes to the way the engine is structured to take advantage of some of the latest generation of cards, probably we'll only be able to do that minimally, if at all, because that could create other problems. Certainly other technologies that we're developing, like our Sovereign engine, and the technology for products beyond that (which I actually can't talk about) will take advantage of all the hardware. <P>

---------------<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> I know a lot of the models in the expansion pack are going to be higher quality models, what about current models, like the very common ones, like the character models for the player races. Are those going to be upgraded at all?<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> No plans to do that. Basically, we only have a fixed amount of resources and we have decided to concentrate on new content as opposed to re-doing old content.<P>

---------------<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> Given that the expansion pack has higher system requirements than the original, is it just a lot of little things contributing to it, or are zones and everything going to be bigger than they were before.<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> Bigger.  In terms of square footage, they'll all be pretty large. Obviously, you already have varying sizes of zones -- Qeynos hills is one of the smallest, and West Karana is one of the largest. So, you'll have varying physical sizes of zones and they'll mostly be very large. But, they will be bigger in the sense that they will take up more memory because we're putting a lot more detail and larger textures into it and such (the main reason behind upping the memory requirements). Then, of course, using larger textures, and more textures, uses more texture memory on your 3D card, hence the increased requirements for the 3d Card, and then to process the polygons, we're using more detail in terms the polygons, that takes more CPU and more horsepower on the 3d Card. But it’s an incremental step up in system requirements. We're probably looking at a minimum 266 [CPU], minimum 64 megs of RAM, the more RAM the better, but it's not a huge jump. It’s pretty much just keeping up with the fact that systems are getting more and more powerful every day.<P>

---------------<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> the user interface for example, when your buying items, trading weapons, and plans for that to basically change with the resolution, to make it scaleable?<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> No short term plans for that, possibly long term plans. It’s not an easy task. It was actually designed back when the idea of having a 3d card going beyond 640x480 was like, yeah right. Know what I mean?  But by the time we got the game done it was like, oh, no problem. <P>

---------------<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> That pretty much wraps up all the questions I had for ya, I'd like to take this chance to   thank you guys for giving me this chance to drop down and say hi to you guys, and as a small thank you, I know its not much, here's a notcrazy pencil, [Brad chuckles] one of eight in the world, all hand carved personally by me. And that, pretty much wraps this up.<P>
