<font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> What about group member limits? Do you plan to increase that from its current limit? I read a good suggestion on the newsgroups once, that would be to basically make a group of groups to sort of make a war party. <P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> I like the idea, however there are no short term plans for that, but I wouldn't rule it out. And I do like the idea where you have a greater group structure and then the smaller parties of six could exist within those greater group structures such that a large band of people, lets say, are going to assault a dragon or something, and it would assist them in organization and communication. I think it's a great idea.<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> I would definitely have to give kudos to any group of five or six that can go in and take out lady Vox.<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><a href="http://eq.notcrazy.com/articles/eqncbrad2.jpg" target="_new"><img src="http://eq.notcrazy.com/articles/eqncbrad2.jpg" height="146" width="195" align="right" border="0"></a><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> Well, yeah, absolutely, and of course it is part of the challenge, by design, for going to, let’s say, one of the alternate planes or assaulting a dragon. One of the big challenges by design is the organization necessary. I mean, just as in real life, if your planning any kind of large scale assault, just being able to keep that many people together and focused, and on task, is a challenge which requires some pretty hefty leadership. I definitely want that to also be true in EverQuest, and it is. Just because you have a bunch of high-level guys doesn't mean your going to be able to pull something like that off. You have to work well together as a group and cooperate. But with that said, I'm not against giving those groups some additional tools to facilitate their communication.<P>

---------------<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> Blame it on Douglas Adams as I've been reading Hitchhikers Guide [to the galaxy] lately, are there any NPCs programmed to ask "What?", "I don't understand!", and "Have you seen my pants?"<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> [laughs] There may be some out there. I know a lot of the guys writing NPC dialog and some of the quests definitely try to interject a bit of humor in there.<P>

---------------<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> What is the one thing in the ruins of Kunark that you really think will wow the EQ fans?<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> Hmm. Well, it could be any one of the three major aspects of the expansion. Those three being: an entirely new continent to explore, and the new playable race, then the updated graphics.  I guess myself personally, there's a lot of explorer in me - that’s personally how I play these games. So, just the opportunity to find all the nooks and crannies and hidden entrances and secret passages, and the new dungeons and new outdoor zones… that's what gets me most excited, but it really depends on the player.<P>

---------------<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> EQ is by far the most popular Massively Multi-player On-line RPG, what do you think has been one of the biggest keys to it's success?<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><a href="http://eq.notcrazy.com/articles/eqncbrad3.jpg" target="_new"><img src="http://eq.notcrazy.com/articles/eqncbrad3s.jpg" height="146" width="195" align="right" border="0"></a><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> Hmm... I think it's a combination of... well with EverQuest, there is a short term and a long term focus, and I think we, in terms of bringing a player in and getting him or her really into the game and addicted and committed to playing the game do pretty well at that.  There is that first hook of bringing them in and attracting them and the second part is keeping them playing. And I think we pulled that off. We achieved both of those really well. The first thing is bringing them in is the graphics. I think it’s a very immersive world and I think we really pulled off the 3d environment pretty well. A lot of people said it couldn't be done, you couldn't have a massively multi-player 3d game. And with the multiple camera views and the fantastic artists we have on the team and the world builders and the real stark contrast between the different areas of the world, I really think it makes people want to explore. They really feel like they're there. I think that sucks people in and gets them really interested. And then what keeps them playing is the cooperative nature of the game. Where as some of our competition in the past focused more on player versus player and really felt that, well, I've heard statements like to have a community you need to have that kind of conflict, which I don't agree with. Instead we focused on cooperation and people meeting friends on-line and going out in parties together and working together -- those friendships and that cooperation keeps them playing. And then there’s all the stuff that keeps people playing any RPG: character development, acquiring items, and treasure, and stuff like that. I think all of these points together is what brings people in and keeps them playing.<P>

---------------<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> What do you think has been the biggest feat, the hardest thing to accomplish that you've managed to accomplish with Ruins of Kunark, or hope to get accomplished with Ruins of Kunark?<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> Well, Just getting it all done. As a designer, and I'm sure my team feels the same way, you always feel compelled to do better than you did before. In addition to better graphics and larger textures and more polygons, we’re really focusing on a lot more detail in the world. There's a lot more fine-tuning, a lot more areas that are more memorable, even more immersive. You know you always try to do better than you did before. So, at first with the expansion, we were like, okay, no problem, we're just going to create a bunch of new zones, just the same way we did before. You know, ‘been there, done that’ right? We'll just have to crank out some zones. But then, our kind of innate desire to better ourselves, to do better than we did last time too over. So it’s just a heck of a lot of work making 20 plus new zones and making them that much better than before. It’s just a lot of work, but its worth it because, they're something fantastic.<P>

---------------<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Arr:</i></font><font color="white" face="Verdana"> How about a quick run down of the big name features in the expansion I know you have the new continent, the new race, and the updated graphics. What else is a big feature in it?<P>

</font><font color="gold" face="Georgia" size="+1"><i>Brad:</i></font><font color="#ECD278" face="Verdana"> To be honest with you, beyond that which we have already revealed on the web page, there isn't anything we could go over at this time. That's really about all we're prepared to announce at this time.<P>
