        Yukitaro Antslayer sent in a lot of great items for our Equipment
        section! He is lvl 46 and the GM&nbsp;of KEG on Rathe. Thoril Honorblade
        sent in the stats for the Mistmoore shield as well. Thanks a lot! I am
        going to write an editorial on the Paladin class and inviting Verant to
        take a look. After reading my editorial, I will set up a seperate
        message board to respond and discuss it. If ANYONE&nbsp;would like to
        write a differing opinion I will post it as well. This new section will
        be on the balance of the Paladin Class in Norrath.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">June 27 </font><font face="Arial" size="3">-
        Tait sent in the information on Ringmail Armour. Thanks a lot Tait! You
        can see it <a HREF="../ringmail.htm">here</a>, or go to Information,
        Weapons and Armour. Yukitaro Antslayer sent in some great info, look for
        it soon!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">June 22 -</font><font face="Arial" size="3">
        Zanto sent in a great story about his journey into Innothule and his
        fight for Ghoulbane! Thanks a lot Zanto! You can see it <a HREF="../story3.htm">here</a>
        or click on Information, Player Stories. Although some disagree with the
        retrieval of Ghoulbane, a story is fun to read anyways. Lots of new
        items being worked on, should have them posted tomorrow.</font></p>

        - Busy weekend! Received quite a few great emails on Friday. I have
        posted as much as I have time for tonight. Check <a HREF="../weaparm.htm">here</a>
        for the latest and greatest Weapons and Armour. Click <a HREF="../leather.htm">here</a>
        to see Leather added to the Armour section. Thanks to Wismerhill of
        Solusek Ro for the Gigantic Zweihander, Chirche for the Shiny Brass
        Halberd, Saerloon for the Blackened Iron Bastard Sword and Tait, who's
        pic is posted for the Leather Armour! Thanks a lot everyone!</font></p>

        - Finished up an Editorial written by Kirel Redhand of Crimson Rose. It
        is an interesting overview of the Gods and the role of a Paladin. Thank
        you Kirel! Good work! You can see it <a HREF="../edit2.htm">here</a>.
        Congrats to FoH last night. They successfully killed Lady Vox in
        Permafrost. The GMs were in attendance and congratulated them. The
        Dragon carried seven UNIQUE&nbsp;items. Each Server has seven different
        unique items on Lady Vox. Get up to level 50 quick! You can read all
        about it <a HREF="http://www.firesofheaven.org/foh/index.htm">here</a>.
        On a personal note:&nbsp;Last night was great! We ventured into Runnyeye
        and I was lucky enough to get myself a Blackened Iron Crown! Keep up the
        Good Work!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">June 15</font><font face="Arial" size="3">
        - Added a bunch of new items to Paladins Equipment last night. Just
        posting them over lunch hour today. You can see them <a HREF="../weaparm.htm">here</a>.
        Or go to Information, Weapons and Armour. Also added a few links.</font></p>

        Lo and Behold! Dame Kathia du Lac has found a major element of the
        Soulfire Quest! Click <a HREF="../zimel.htm">here</a> to get the latest
        development in the most exciting Quest ever! Sandain of the Children of
        Tunare has sent in the information for Bronze Plate. Thank you Sandain!
        Check out the Armour section under Information and see the changes made
        to Plate and Bronze Plate. Keep this great info coming! Any Paladins out
        there have a full suit of Leather? Send a pic of yourself and an
        inventory screenshot to <a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">June 10 -</font><font face="Arial" size="3">
        Added some graphical plates to the Message Boards. I will also be adding
        links to this page. A&nbsp;large number of people get to the message
        boards without coming here first. Added a great story by Cheradenine of
        Bristlebane. Great story! It can be found <a HREF="../story2.htm">here</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">June 9</font><font face="Arial" size="3">
        - Updated Links page. Fixed up Dame Kathia du Lac's plate pic. Sorry
        Milady! You were looking stretched for a while there. :-) I would also
        like to add another feature to Armour. Along the top I will have two
        sizes. Small and Medium. There are weight differences for small and
        medium and can change Overall Weight. Any Dwarf or Elf have a full set
        of banded? I&nbsp;also received the info for Small Bronze Armour. I&nbsp;will
        post this as quick as I can. The latest patch in EQ also allows one
        thing I missed very much. 100% of text is now sent with your words. When
        you used to type :-) or ... or !? etc, only the first character would
        appear. Now they all do! Thank you Verant!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">June 8 </font><font face="Arial" size="3">-
        Added EQ'Lizer to links and started updating Links page. Do you know of
        any other class specific sites out there? What are your favourites? I
        know of a Bard site that is quite good. Going to post that later. Any
        others? Send links to <a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">June 7 -</font><font face="Arial" size="3">
        Added the Brilliant Sword of Faith to the Holy Swords list. Thanks for
        reminding me about it! Plate section is up, just very incomplete.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">June 5 </font><font face="Arial" size="3">-
        Completed the Banded section. Working on Plate now. Varrus(my character)
        is the model for Banded. The famed Dame Kathia du Lac will be our model
        for the Plate section. Any Elves or Dwarves out there who would be
        willing to send in a pic of your armour and a screenshot of your
        inventory? I still require full suits of Cloth, Patchwork, Leather and
        Chain. After we get the basic armour out of the way we can start to post
        Bronze, Rubicite and Mithril, etc etc.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">June 4</font><font face="Arial" size="3">
        - 10000 hits! Dame Kathia du Lac has sent me a pic and some info on
        Plate Armour. Thank you very much Dame Kathia! The Banded section is
        just about done. If you have any ideas on improving the layout, drop me
        an email at:&nbsp;<a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a>.
        Yeldarb SpiritBlade of Rathe sent in the Quest info for the Test of
        Truth. Thank you very much Yeldarb! It can be found <a HREF="../truth.htm">here</a>
        or under Information/Quests.&nbsp;</font></p>

        - I put the May news on a link to reduce clutter on the news page. I
        have almost completed the banded armour description. What I need now are
        fellow Paladins who would be willing to send in a pic of themselves with
        a complete set of Leather, Chainmail, Cloth and Plate. I also need the
        weight and Armour Class of each item. I can handle just the pics though.
        I can't afford to have of everything. hehe Dame Kathia du Lac has posted
        on the Quest board about a response she has received re:&nbsp;Zimel
        Quest. It is indeed not complete but we will keep you up to date as fast
        as possible. Also posted the stats for a regular halberd. I will post
        the Verant response re:&nbsp;Zimel's Blades as soon as I can. Keep up
        the good work!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">May 31 -</font><font face="Arial" size="3">
        Decided to change the layout for certain parts of the site. I have begun
        the &quot;upgrade&quot; to the Weapons and Holy Swords. I will have one
        section for Armour and Weapons and the other for Holy Swords. Does
        anyone have a full suit of plate? Of leather? I have a full set of
        banded so I will show the example I would like to create from that. I
        will also be posting the stats on all weapon types, focusing on weapons
        Paladins use. A few beginners have sent me questions regarding becoming
        a Paladin. Does anyone have a Player Guide that could target starting
        Paladins in the starting cities? I would like one for Freeport, Felwithe,
        Kaladim, Qeynos and Erudin. Thanks for all the support. Look for
        exciting changes and check back every day!</font></p>
