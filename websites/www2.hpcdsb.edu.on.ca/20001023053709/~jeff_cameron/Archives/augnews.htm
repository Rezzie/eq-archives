        <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><b>August 23 - </b></font>Well,
        Vacation was great! Back to the Grindstone and improving this website.
        Working on improving graphics and overall appearance. Anyone have Cloth
        Armour for a screenshot? I still do not have any information on the BSOF&nbsp;Quest.
        Is there none? If you know the Quest, not how to get the blade, can you
        send me the information to <a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>August 12 - </b></font>Posted
        the information for the Shining Star of Light Quest. Thanks to Blackwing
        for the information. Going to verify the Quest tonight with the other
        solutions that were sent in. Does anyone think they have the fortitude
        to write an advanced Paladin Player Guide? I would like to have a Guide
        from levels 1-20, 20-40 and then 40-50. If you think you can effectively
        put together some information, please send it to :<a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">&nbsp;paladin@lweb.net.</a>
        And, on a side note, Congratulations Kaladin and Friends! That was great
        fun last week and I am glad you aquired Ghoulbane. How's it holding up?
        *grins* Have you cleaned out Lower Guk with it yet?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>August 11 - </b></font>Started
        a large update to the whole site. Click <a HREF="../gencon.htm">here
        for Gilfalas' GenCon coverage</a> to get the latest in the EQ
        Universe. Thanks a lot for all the work Gil! Added a link to Tristram's
        Website(on the Links Page). He has a lot of information and it is a
        great site. Please drop by and check it out. Posted the Final Draft that
        was sent to Verant by Gilfalas. In addition to the Petition, I&nbsp;have
        posted Verant's responses. Check it out <a HREF="../petition.htm">here</a>.
        Royal sent me a story a while ago, found it in my archives and posted
        it. Sorry about the wait Royal! You can find it in the <a HREF="../story.htm">Stories</a>
        section. Valor Fireheart sent in the stats for Ribcage Armour and the
        Silvery 2 Handed Axe. Thanks a lot! Check it out in the Equipment
        section.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>August 10 - </b></font>Wow,
        having a lot of great fun on Tallon Zek. Getting excited about Kunark as
        well. Check out EQVault for some info. Working on a couple of things,
        still waiting for the Shining Star of Light Quest info. Are there any
        high level Paladins out there who have journeyed to the Planes? Any
        Paladin specific items that would be of worth or interest? Send it to <a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a></font></p>
