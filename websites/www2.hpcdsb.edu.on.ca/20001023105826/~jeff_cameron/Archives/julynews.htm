        - </font>Gilfalas has sent in a Petition to Verant that closely
        resembles the 2nd Draft. Aside from a few typos, it is in general
        agreement with most of you. If Gilfalas could send me a copy of it, I
        will post it as the Final Draft. I would like to hear thoughts on titles
        and the relative importance of them as a priority to other classes being
        fixed. I received 6 emails in the last two days asking for this to be
        included. A discussion won't harm anyone. :-) Has any completed the
        Shining Star of Light Quest? If so, can you send us in the description?
        And a screenshot of the Orb? Send it to <a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a></font></p>

        </font>THE AFTERMATH - I learned a valuable lesson today. *smile* I
        should have prefaced the proposed ideas with this comment : I did not
        make these suggestions up. They came to me in emails from various
        posters on the site. I received a few immature and childish emails
        calling my intelligence into question? I posted the Petition so that the
        Paladins of Norrath could be heard. There are many differing opinions.
        Some valid, some not. I wish I could share everything with all of you
        but I cannot. The only idea that came personally from me was the idea of
        a ranged Taunt or similar spell that allowed us to tag mobs from a
        distance. If you would like to comment on the Petition, remember, I am
        reiterating ideas from all of YOU. A few valid points came out though. I
        think the Petition has served its purpose in garnering discussion on our
        Class. I think we are doing well when most requests are based on
        improving our Class as Characters and not as &quot;They are better, we
        want more.&quot; Some call it nitpicking, I call it a game that should
        suit the people that play it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1">July 23 -</font><font SIZE="+3"> </font>Updated
        the Petition. More informative, took out some of the useless things.
        Reposted on General Board, please read. <a HREF="../petition.htm">Here.</a></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1">July 23 -</font><font SIZE="+3"> </font>Worked
        last night on compiling everyone's suggestions and ideas and have put
        together a Petition(cringe). I feel it is well balanced and thought out.
        I am posting it <a HREF="../petition.htm">here</a> to be read, and will
        be posting it on the General Board to read your comments. After
        reviewing everyone's thoughts, I will do a final draft and we can send
        it off. I think the Paladin class is well balanced as it is, but these
        changes would enable us to be more in character and feel like we ARE&nbsp;Paladins.</font></p>

        </font>Well, Sir Lucan has been put back but he has a new friend!
        Brother Anton(Cleric) is always close to him and will make the combat
        extremely difficult. Has anyone done the Quest for Sir Lucan? If you
        have, can you please send me the information to:<a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a>
        Sir Lucan drops an item that grants you the Brilliant Sword of Faith but
        I would like the facts before I post the information. Luck to thee All!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1">July 15 - </font>I have received
        numerous emails asking about information of the BSOF and how to obtain
        it. It seems Verant has disabled the Quest. There is a path bug with Sir
        Lucan D'Lere the Captain of the Freeport Militia. They have removed him
        from the game until they repair the problem. Until then, there is no
        BSOF Quest, meaning the SoulFire Quest is also broken. As soon a I hear
        word of Sir Lucan appearing once again, I will get you all of the
        information I can. Until then, Luck to thee! And I am working on posting
        more information.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1">July 8 - </font>Ungrim Ironfist
        has found Soulfire! I read about his findings on EQVault. Click <a HREF="../zimel.htm">here</a>
        to see the updated Quest Info. I have updated the Zimel's Blade Quest as
        we now know it is working and there is a path we can follow. Now that
        the Quest is complete, please read the solution by Chapter and ONLY&nbsp;read
        it if you are stuck. Aside from early on, the Quest is fairly easy to
        follow and you should be able to solve it without help. Soulfire IS&nbsp;a
        no drop item. It is for Paladins only. You must be a very high level to
        complete the Quest. This is the only reason I have posted the Quest
        information. Please use it wisely. Also posted the information I&nbsp;have
        received on the Brilliant Sword of Faith. Many Paladins have sent me the
        information over the past few days and I thank thee for your help. Would
        like to get a screenshot of a player in possession of the BSOF.
        Interested? Send it to <a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1">July 6 - </font>Great long
        weekend! Time to get back to work! I received an email last night about
        SoulFire. It seems someone has attained one and is auctioning it on a
        server. I&nbsp;do not where, or who has it but the email did say they
        would tell me what they know in a day or so. (Take this knowledge with a
        grain of salt) Working on updating the Zimel's Blade Quest and finishing
        off the skills list. Posted two stories by Kulgan Kardaan and Patryn
        Brightflame. Both well written and very entertaining! You can see them <a HREF="../story.htm">here</a>.
