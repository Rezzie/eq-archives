    <p><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 1 :</font>&nbsp;</font></b>Kalatrina
    Plossen is one of the greatest Paladins in the Land. Her duty is to train new, young
    knights and keep an eye on the Hated Freeport Militia. She can be found at the Hall of
    Truth in North Freeport. She is directly above the entrance on the second floor. When you
    Hail her, she informs you she has need of young knights. After further investigation, you
    learn of a spy within the Militia. He is in danger and Kalatrina hands you a note to give
    to him. He can be found in the Freeport Militia House.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 2 :</font> </font></b>The beginnings
    of your Quest! Rush over to the Militia House. The spy is in the middle of the Militia
    House in the Courtyard on the first floor. You give him the code and he warns you of
    danger. You hand him the note. Suddenly, Militia swarm to the spy and begin attacking him!
    He hands you an old piece of burned parchment and yells to return to the Hall of Truth. He
    falls to the Evil Guards. Run to the Hall of Truth! Upon further inspection of the note
    you read:&nbsp;Zimel's Blades with some prices. Give the note to Kalatrina. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 3 :</font> </font></b>Kalatrina is
    excited by the note you have been given. DO&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;give Kalatrina Plossen the Note.
    If you do, restart the Quest and get it again. This is where the Quest is
    counter-intuitive. If you give her the Note, she tells you Zimel was a great Blacksmith
    who knew the secret of enchanting blades and making superior weapons. She tells you to go
    and talk to Rashinda Elore at the Office of the People. Rashinda is difficult to get any
    information out of but once you do, you determine that Groflah Steadirt of Groflah's
    Forge, was a friend of Zimel's and may have more information. When you ask Rashinda of
    Zimel's Blades, Lakeen Boorheez wanders in, saying he is lost. He quickly exits and heads
    to the tunnels.</p>
    <p><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 4 :</font>&nbsp;</font></b>Run over to
    Groflah's Forge and ask him about Zimel. He is on the second floor of the Forge and is not
    very helpful. He is nervous when you ask him of Zimel and tells you he will not speak
    here. Hand Groflah the Note you received from the Spy. Groflah tells you many things and
    asks you to meet him at the Seafarer's Roost. He can study the Note and try to decode the
    information. Groflah hands you the Note back. </p>
    <p><b><font SIZE="+1" color="#808000">Chapter 5 :&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;</b>Wandering over to
    the Seafarer's Roost, buy a drink, relax and watch Freeport go about its business. Groflah
    SHOULD&nbsp;show up between 1am and 3am. When he arrives, ask who Zimel is. He will go
    into a long story about how Zimel has disappeared and the Blade, Soulfire has been lost.
    Hand Groflah the Note and he attempt to decipher it. Groflah tells you that he thinks Sir
    Lucan D'Lere, Head of the Freeport Militia, and Pietro Zarn, Head of the ShadowKnight
    Guild in Freeport are in cahoots and searching for Soulfire as well.</p>
    <p><b><font SIZE="+1" color="#808000">Chapter 6 :</font> </b>Thanking him for his
    knowledge, look about the Seafarer's Roost. Who is wandering around? A&nbsp;beggar named
    Tykar Renlin should be close by. Asking Tykar for information about Zimel, Tykar responds
    by saying he is thirsty. Purchase a Drom's Champagne from the Bartender and give one to
    Tykar. Repeat this three more times. Tykar informs you that Zimel has been thrown into
    Prison by the Militia near the Arena. Feeling guilty, Tykar hands you a blanket to give to
    Zimel if you should meet him.</p>
    <p><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 7 :</font>&nbsp;</font></b>Alas! It is
    true! Zimel is locked in a cell and has been driven crazy. After asking Zimel various
    Questions, he responds by saying he wants some items. After deciphering his unintelligible
    speech, you determine he wants Bog Juice, Edible Goo and a Blanket. Well, Tykar gave you
    the Blanket. You have seen Edible Goo in the various Bakeries and know it is the most
    basic of delicacies. Bog Juice, wait! You know a Brewer who has the recipe and seem to
    recall even drinking some before! Hand each of these items to Zimel. Zimel will give you a
    key simply marked H.K.102</p>
    <p><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 8 :</font> </font></b>H.K.102? 'tis a
    Chest key. Ah! In Highhold Pass, Humans have built a bank there to guard their riches from
    the barbaric Orcs and Gnolls. Visit the bank in Highhold Pass and hand the Bank Clerk the
    key. She thanks you for the key and hands you a Note to deliver to Brother Hayle. Alas,
    she is certain he is being held captive in a cell in Splitpaw, a Gnoll stronghold. </p>
    <p><b><font SIZE="+1" color="#808000">Chapter 9 : </font></b>Journeying into Splitpaw, you
    find Brother Hayle and hand him the Note. Brother Hayle hands you the Note once again and
    asks you to retrieve a number of items for him. He would like you to prove your nobility
    to him. He asks you to bring the Hilt of Soulfire back to him. The Hilt is being held by
    an Evil ShadowKnight named Xicotl in MistMoore Castle! As well, bring him the Brilliant
    Sword of Faith(Quest info <a HREF="bsof.htm">here</a>). Finally, he asks you to bring your
    Testimony(Quest info <a HREF="truth.htm">here</a>).</p>
    <p><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 10&nbsp;:</font>&nbsp;</font></b>You
    have destroyed and defeated many Evil Creatures that wander Norrath. You have lived up to
    your name and go back to Brother Hayle, truly bringing proof of your Nobility. Brother
    Hayle will thank you and grant you the greatest blade in the land! Soulfire!</p>
