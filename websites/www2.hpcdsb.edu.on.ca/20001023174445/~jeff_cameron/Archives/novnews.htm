        All, I have found an interim solution to the Message Boards. I think you
        will like them. I have also made registration optional. This will also
        allow everyone to post information about themselves as per the request
        from early last week. I think most things are worked out so far, will
        just be tweaking the settings over the next few days. Check it out!
        Register! Put little funky pics under your names. :-) Also updated the
        AC&nbsp;on the Armour of Ro. Here is the link to our <a HREF="../message.htm">old
        message boards</a>. Please do not post to them and just grab any
        information you require from them. I will leave them up for a while.</font></p>
        <font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>November 3 - </b></font>YIPPEE!
        Woohoo! Talk about a great day in EverQuest! This is what today's patch
        message is :</font><b> </b>
        <p align="center"><font COLOR="#CC0000"><b>*Item Enhancements*</b></font>
        </p>
        <p><b><font COLOR="#CC0000">The entire set of the Armor or Ro (Paladin
        class specific armor) and Darkforge (ShadowKnight class armor) has
        received an increase in AC</font><font COLOR="#CC0000" face="Arial">.</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">So, any of you Paladins out there with the Armour
        of Ro. Can you post some stats on the General Message Board? I will post
        a header that reads Armour of Ro. On another note, my Companions and I
        decided to attempt Ghoulbane last night. Well, after two hours(not my
        first time) the Shin Lord spawned in front of me. Sword in hand! A quick
        fight and it was mine! Anything interesting you would like to send to
        Paladins of Norrath? Send it to <a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>November 2 - </b></font>LARGE&nbsp;update
        today. I had all of this ready to go last night. Jixl Xycron of Xegony
        sent me in stats for <a HREF="../valorium.htm">Valorium Armour</a>. I
        finally have them posted(I&nbsp;still need the arms). :-) Thank you Jixl!
        Vladimirr D'Benefiece of Bristlebane asked me to post the Reagent
        required for the Symbol line of <a HREF="../spells.htm">spells</a>.
        Thanks for the input, hope you like it! Renain sent in some information
        on the <a HREF="../star.htm">Shining Star of Light Quest</a>. He sent in
        who to talk to to get it recharged. Avarus of Innoruuk sent in a screen
        pic of the <a HREF="../magitem.htm#mow">Man-O-War</a>. Thank you all!
        Anything interesting you would like to send to Paladins of Norrath? Send
        it to <a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a>.</font></p>
