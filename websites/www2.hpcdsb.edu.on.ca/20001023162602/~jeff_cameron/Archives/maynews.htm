        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 26 </font>- <font SIZE="-1">Have
        a few minutes for lunch. I received an email about Zimel's Blades. Thank
        you Dame Kathia du Lac very much for the info and I updated the page
        right away, just forgot to post it. </font><a HREF="../zimel.htm"><font SIZE="-1">Here</font></a><font SIZE="-1">
        it is now. As well, does anyone have a rundown of the Test of Truth
        Quest? Can you email the details so I&nbsp;can get it posted? </font><a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net"><font SIZE="-1">paladin@lweb.net</font></a><font SIZE="-1">.
        That way we can get more information out there. As well, do you know
        anyone who plays a Paladin in EverQuest? Have they seen Paladins of
        Norrath? I am just wondering what the percentage would be for people who
        know of our page. And, a little advertising never hurt anyone! :-) Tell
        your friends! Let's break the Counter.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 25</font> - <font SIZE="-1">I&nbsp;have
        posted the Quests page finally! Zimel's Blades has the honour of
        becoming the first Quest to be posted. Quests are under Information. I
        have posted the steps I know from the Message Board. The info on this
        Quest is by no means perfect. If you notice ANY&nbsp;problems or
        discrepancies, please send me an aswer to :</font><a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net"><font SIZE="-1">&nbsp;paladin@lweb.net</font></a><font SIZE="-1">.
        I am planning on including Keywords and screenshots in the future, but
        feel the data is what most need now. If you have been able to get ANY&nbsp;further
        on this Quest please send me the info or post it on the Quests board. I
        am also going to stop the Beginners Board as there has been no interest
        in it. Any ideas for the board? For now, it will be changed to an in
        persona, Tavern, God's Might. Post stories of Truth and Justice! Your
        battles and victories! All are welcome.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 24 </font>- <font SIZE="-1">Dakk
        Kirrawak of the Protectors of Tunare sent in some great info on
        Ghoulbane! Check out the Information section under Holy Swords or you
        can get see it </font><a HREF="../ghoulbane.htm"><font SIZE="-1">here</font></a><font SIZE="-1">.
        Our Holy Sword section has been started! Anyone own a Bone Bladed
        Claymore? Soulfire? *grin* Send me a quick pic of stats and yourself
        armed with it. You will become immortalized much like Dakk on the
        Paladins of Norrath!</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 19 -</font> <font SIZE="-1">Chirche
        of Tunare sent Paladins of Norrath a great story! 'tis a great tale and
        I hope you all take a moment to read it. It is under Information or can
        be found </font><a HREF="../story1.htm"><font SIZE="-1">here.</font></a><font SIZE="-1">
        On another note I have received numerous emails and offers of help. I
        truly appreciate the help you all have offered. I am going over the
        future of Paladins of Norrath and am figuring out the best way to
        incorporate everyones skills and ideas. I would still love Player Guides
        and Stories as well! Keep them coming! Email them to me at </font><a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net"><font SIZE="-1">paladin@lweb.net</font></a><font SIZE="-1">.
        Thanks for all of the help and Fare thee well!</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 18</font> - <font SIZE="-1">Completed
        most of the skill list late last night. Finally have a couple of minutes
        so it is now posted. No description of the Magic skills. I still haven't
        found a good enough explanation of them and will work on that tonight.
        Haven't had any response on Holy Swords. As soon as I get some concrete
        information I can design a page for them. If you own one, take a
        screenshot with the stats showing. Send the screenshot to </font><a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net"><font SIZE="-1">paladin@lweb.net</font></a><font SIZE="-1">.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 17</font> - <font SIZE="-1">I
        wrote an Editorial over the weekend to address what I&nbsp;feel is an
        important issue with Paladins. Please read it and post some comments on
        the General Board or email me at:&nbsp;</font><a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net"><font SIZE="-1">paladin@lweb.net</font></a><font SIZE="-1">.
        The Editorial is under Information or can be found </font><a HREF="../edit1.htm"><font SIZE="-1">here</font></a><font SIZE="-1">.
        The skill list is well under way, there are just A&nbsp;LOT&nbsp;of
        skills. Hope to have it done soon.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 15</font> - <font SIZE="-1">The
        message board has been VERY&nbsp;busy. Thank you everyone for such a
        great response! I am splitting the message board into 3 separate boards
        to meet the demand. I have the messages to stay for 200 posts and that
        is the most the service will provide. If we split up the board into 3
        distinct groups it will work out well. We will keep the current board as
        a general discussion area. The two new boards will be: Beginners, this
        board is where new Paladins can post questions. Experienced Paladins,
        please take a look at this board every once in a while and post answers
        to some of the questions. The third board will be dedicated to Quests
        and Holy Swords. As I get information on Holy Swords I will post the
        information on the website. If you own a Holy Sword, can you leave a
        post on the Quests Board. I will contact one of you. I would like to get
        a screenshot of the specs and stats etc. Lots of ideas! Now we just have
        to get all of them on the site!</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 14 -</font> <font SIZE="-1">Rolan
        of&nbsp;COR posted his version of a Player's Guide on the message board.
        I have it posted now so enjoy! I think I&nbsp;have finally figured out
        how to do the top banner without being too large etc. Now onto other
        things! I have a breakdown of all the skills we get as Paladins and a
        short description of them coming soon! Have a good weekend! If things go
        well I should FINALLY&nbsp;be Level 20!</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 13</font> - <font SIZE="-1">Had
        a short break at work so I decided to post a new nav image I worked on
        last weekend. If you like it great! If not, I'm open to suggestions.
        Just have to figure out how to put a border on it so it doesn't look
        like a square. Keep playing!</font>&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 13</font> - <font SIZE="-1">Well,
        I need a hand. I have decided to put my energies into improving the
        overall visuals on the site. I can do that, what I need the help with is
        content. Do you have a story? Interesting Info? I would also like to do
        information on Quests. Zimel's blades? I am fairly far into that one,
        one step behind the furthest I have heard. I would also like some info
        on the Paladin Guilds throughout Norrath. Location, merchants etc. AND,
        if there are Good alignment Guilds out there that are basically centered
        on Paladins send me a link and I'll post them for all to see. As well,
        One of Us will become famous! I would like to post information on the
        highest ranked Paladin in Everquest. Then start a Hall of Fame as we all
        hit 50. Be the first one there! Luck to thee and Fight well!</font>&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 12</font> - <font SIZE="-1">Serelas
        sent me an email regarding the Guide posted by Gil-Glorion. Was the
        Taunt skill ever attained at 8 in betas? Anyways, I deleted the Taunt at
        level 8 bullet and put a short comment for level 1 or 2 to use 1 or 2
        points! 'tis now a work of art! Good work Paladins of Norrath!</font>&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 12 -</font> <font SIZE="-1">Well,
        I have a few moments for lunch. I have posted Gil-Glorion's Player
        Guide. I made a couple of changes to update the skill information. Thank
        you Gil-Glorion! If you are interested in submitting any material to the
        Paladins of Norrath, please send me an email to:&nbsp;</font><a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net"><font SIZE="-1">paladin@lweb.net</font></a><font SIZE="-1">

        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">May 11</font> - <font SIZE="-1">Thank
        you all! The response to this site has been outstanding! Within hours, I
        had over 20 emails from Paladins across the land! I have a PvP&nbsp;Article
        being written and received an email with a great listing of Paladin
        Spells from level 9 - 49! There are a couple Player Guides done already
        and I am receiving more. I am going to post most, if not all Guides I
        receive. You can never have too much information! The message board is
        going well. Thank you for all the support! Now I REALLY&nbsp;have to
        improve this site before too many people see it this way! *grin*</font></font></p>

        Newcomers! If thou art here, thou art most assuredly a Paladin, a
        Warrior of the Light or fight for Justice in Norrath! I wanted to get
        the Message Board up ASAP and will be working on the rest of the site
        throughout the week. By Friday all links should get you somewhere. I was
        surfing the web last night trying to come up with some half decent pics.
        It is tough. Not really any good &quot;Paladin&quot; pics out there. If
        you know of any, can you post some links on the board, or if there are
        fairly small, email me at </font><a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net"><font SIZE="-1">paladin@lweb.net</font></a><font SIZE="-1">.
        And of course, send me any Player Guides you have created or Articles
        you would like posted. Enjoy the site!</font></font></p>
