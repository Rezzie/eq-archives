        have been VERY busy again at work.&nbsp; The site is in need of some
        drastic updating.&nbsp; I have started Paladins of Norrath, Part 3. It
        is quite similar to this, but I am organizing it and polishing the parts
        I have missed.&nbsp; I am completing the Armour Guides and will be
        starting a REAL section for Paladin equipment.&nbsp; Basically, if it
        has PAL on it, you should be able to look it up.&nbsp; As well, a few
        Quests are being updated and there are some great Guides I have.&nbsp;
        Wildantor, can you please send me a copy of your Ro Armour comments to <a href="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a>?&nbsp;
        Thanks for all the help everyone!</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="4" color="#808000">April 11 - </font></b><font color="#000000" size="3">There
        is an interesting discussion about the Planes on the General Forum.&nbsp;
        Would any lvl 50+ Planes veterans be interested in putting together a
        couple of Guides?&nbsp; I am sure they would be read by all.&nbsp; I am
        40 now! but am interested in how the Planes work.&nbsp; Any Paladin from
        level 1 to 50 would be interested!&nbsp; Please send in any information
        (if you are experienced) to <a href="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">me</a>.&nbsp;
        Lord Searfire WAS in the Temple last time I checked so the GM was
        mistaken.</font></font>

        just finished a fairly lengthy editorial this weekend and am posting it
        now.&nbsp; You can read it <a href="../edit6.htm">here</a>. Thanks to
        Kuno for the Sands of Ro this weekend!&nbsp; I arrived at Sol Temple to
        speak with Lord Searfire to get another Cauldron.&nbsp; He was not
        there?&nbsp; He did not show up on tracking (thanks to a Druid with me)
        and he was not anywhere I could find.&nbsp; That means NO more Ronium
        for Paladins on Xegony.&nbsp; I sent a tell to a GM and petitioned.&nbsp;
        He said &quot; Check next patch, they must have removed him.&quot;&nbsp;
        Is anyone on the other servers having a problem finding him?&nbsp; A
        little warning or explanation would have been nice. :-)&nbsp;</font></font>
