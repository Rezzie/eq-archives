    <p align="center"><b>by Gil-Glorion </b></p>
    <p>This document is intended to be an inclusive Paladin's guide. In it, I highlight the
    strengths and weakness of the Paladin class, and tell you what and what not to do to be
    effective. I have read all of the Paladin guides I know of, and while they all contain
    good information, none of them IMO tell you all you need to know. Telling you your
    strengths and weaknesses is good, but none of them that I have read have told you what to
    actually do to minimize the weaknesses and use the strengths to their greatest advantage.
    I hope to do this. Let me be frank, Paladins are weaker generally in any role until after
    level 22. Playing a Paladin before this consists of knowing how to use your strengths and
    minimize your weaknesses. Some of this is HEAVILY IMO, and could be disputed. I don't
    cover how to act as a Paladin here, as it would make this too long.</p>
    <p>The basic <b>strengths</b> of the Paladin are:<ul>
      <li>The ability to save the day in a way that no one else can with Lay Hands. This is
        possibly the best ability in the game.</li>
      <li>The ability to provide backup healing/buffing.</li>
      <li>The ability to Tank (which comes to full fruition at level 20).</li>
      <li>The ability to (after level 15) be very effective against undead.</li>
      <li>the ability to solo pretty well.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <b>weaknesses</b> are:<ul>
      <li>The ability to tank is not very good until level 20.</li>
      <li>Leveling is *very* slow.</li>
      <li>You do not get spells until relatively late in your career.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><font SIZE="+1"><b>Starting as a Paladin</b></font></p>
    <p>Paladins need STR (for plate armor) and WIS (for mana) primarily.</p>
    <p>I would say that an 85 STR is minimum to carry loot and wear armor (and even then you
    will need buffing magics probably).</p>
    <p>Having less than a 90 or so WIS begins to degrade the primary benefit of a Paladin,
    which is the healing/buffing/undead DD/Undead Lull ability. If you leave WIS at 60, why
    not just be a Warrior?</p>
    <p>Racially, each choice has it's pros and cons. I refer you to other guides concerning
    races as they are much better than anything I could give you here (eq.stratics.com for
    example). I chose a High Elf for RP purposes, but a Dwarf or Human are argueably the best
    choices.<ul>
      <li>At level 1 drop 5 points into 1 handed slash. This isn't essential but it gives you a
        nice headstart. Maybe one or two into Taunt is helpful as well.</li>
      <li>At level 4 I dropped 10 points into tailoring and did not regret it (but I wouldn't say
        this is necessary since you can buy Patchwork now for cheap. Back then hardly anyone knew
        how to tailor). If you don't you might want to consider dropping some into 2 handed slash.</li>
      <li>At level 6 I drop 10 points into Sense Heading. I guess you could build this from
        nothing but it takes forever, and Sense Heading is *very* valuable.</li>
      <li>At level 6, drop 1 point into Bash.</li>
      <li>At level 9 drop 1 point into Channeling, Divination, Alteration, and Abjuration.</li>
      <li>At level 10, drop 1 point into Dodge,</li>
      <li>At level 12, drop 1 point into Meditate.</li>
      <li>At level 15, save yourself a LOT of frustration and drop at least 10 points into
        Conjuration. Hammer of Wrath costs 50 mana and is your firstn Conjuration spell (i.e. you
        haven't built it up before now). Building it from base is hideously time consuming and
        wastes TONS of mana. Also drop at least 10 points into Evocation for Ward Undead if you
        can.</li>
      <li>At level 17, drop 1 point into Parry.</li>
      <li>At level 20, drop 20 points into Double Strike.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><font SIZE="+1"><b>Starting out</b></font></p>
    <p>I would solo until level 5 at least since this will usually get you to where you need
    to be the quickest. No matter where you are, kill everything in your path that will not
    hurt an important faction (like Pixie Tricksters for example). Stay near the guards if you
    need to run. You should at a minimum have full patchwork and a rusty weapon soon. Most any
    Newbie zone is ok at this level. Build both 1 and 2 handed slash at these levels.</p>
    <p>Levels 5-9 are really hard. You will need friends that will let you group with then
    even though you hit less often and can't cast anything yet. Many powergamers will shun you
    (especially if you just used your Lay Hands) but hopefully some will be impressed by your
    brevity (you are selfless and willing to lay down your life to save another, right?). When
    you get a group of friends to adventure with, tank tank tank. Build Taunt. Try to keep the
    monsters off everyone else, even if you are not the only tank.</p>
    <p>Other players will appreciate this. I always Taunt in combat unless I'm under two
    bubbles of health. Use your Lay Hands sparingly, but use it.</p>
    <p>Don't hog it to yourself. I almost never waste my Lay Hands to defeat a tough monster
    I/we would otherwise not be able to kill. Save it for when a party member really needs it.
    You will make a lot of friends this way. Whenever I see a party member at less than a
    bubble in combat, I Lay On them. Your true usefulness now (and forever) is saving the day
    when no one else can. Almost no class can save the day like you can at this level (and
    none EVER in so dramatic a fashion). If you waste your Lay Hands to solo a tough monster,
    you will not be able to &quot;save the day&quot;. Misty Thicket is where I was at this
    level, and I made out well there. If you have the patience, build 1 handed blunt. This
    isn't necessary, but it will save you time later.</p>
    <p>Levels 6 you get Bash, and I *HIGHLY* recommend you use it. Don't listen to people who
    say Bash is useless. They are wrong when it comes to a Paladin and Bash. Bash may not be
    good for other classes, but it is VERY good for you. It's especially useful with a Shiny
    Brass shield since you can Bash ghouls and such. I bash on an average or 6-8 points per
    hit. Complimented with a Combine weapon, you close the gap a little between those dual
    wielding, kicking fighters. Still not as good, but much better.</p>
    <p>An additional recommendation-Don't use a Minotaur Axe. They are too slow for you as the
    only attack you have, and without Kick or Dual Wield you really pale in comparison to
    other tanks. Try to get a regular/steel/fine steel Longsword or Scimitar. You hit almost
    twice as fast for just a few points less damage per whack. As a Paladin, this will work
    out better. Trust me on this one.</p>
    <p>Levels 9-12 are much better. You *finally* can heal and buff yourself, which are
    lifesavers. I recommend you spend a level or so soloing at level 9 to bring up your feeble
    magical skills (I did this in Misty Thicket on obs/spiders/wasps). By level 10 you should
    be good to go and are ready to be a more valuable asset to the group. Continue doing what
    you were doing before in groups, except now you can heal/cure disease/buff too. By now you
    should be making some decent cash. Start saving for a Combine Longsword/Scimitar and a
    Shiny Brass Shield. I know you are hating that newbie look by now, but you can live in
    leather armor until level 14-15 if you need to. Crushbone, Blackburrow, and Paw are good
    places for you at this level. Complimented with a Combine weapon, you close the gap a
    little between those dual weilding kicking fighters. Still not as good, but much better. I
    developed 2 handed slash until this level, then dropped it (left it at 65 or so) to use
    Bash. It's still high enough to pick it up again later this way. Meditate also makes the
    mana gain a lot faster, and Dodge is nice too. Good places for you now are Befallen and
    Unrest.</p>
    <p>Levels 15-17 You get spell upgrades (yay!). Hammer of Wrath, Holy Armor, Cure Disease,
    Ward Undead, all are great assests and against undead you are a great benefit to any
    group. If you don't have that shiny Combine yet, Hammer of Wrath works just fine and is
    almost as good in fact. I did not build 1 handed blunt until level 13 or so, and it went
    up slowly to start but it did go up. Ward Undead is an awesome spell and is the most
    efficient way to draw from distances and kill undead for you. Once again, you may want to
    solo a while to develop it. I cannot over-emphasize it's utility for you. Alone I use it
    mainly draw and finish off undead, keeping a store to heal myself in combat. In groups I
    burn it all onto them and between that and me hacking away I do a lot of damage.</p>
    <p>If you don't have a Combine sword (or Hammer of Wrath handy with good 1 handed blunt
    skill), Shiny Brass Shield, and at least partial Banded/Ring/Chain armor, you need to make
    that top priority. You need all these IMO to do your job in a group. You definitely go up
    a bunch of notches on the usefulness scale at these levels, especially in places like
    Unrest and Befallen. I began to successfully lead and primary tank in groups around this
    level.</p>
    <p>Levels 17-19 This is the final stretch for us brothers. At 17 we get Parry which is a
    great additon. Not much else to say. Your mana has gotten to the point where you can do a
    very good amount of healing and dish out some serious justice to undead. From my
    observations, if you put stat points where I told you to, you should have a ton of the
    blue stuff in comparison to what your spells cost. People actually start looking for
    Paladins now. Unrest is still good but Befallen is probably too low level for you now. You
    will do well anywhere, but I still recommend you stick to undead areas.</p>
    <p>Levels 20-22, and beyond. You made it. You finally get Double Strike and this closes
    the substantial gap between you and the Warrior in terms of dishing out damage. At this
    level your fighting ability is finally comparable to the other tanks. Level 22 Spells
    bring Root, Center, and Invisibility to Undead (among others). These are the just about
    the most important spells you will ever get, especially Root. You should already have
    enough experience in the game to know what I mean by that. I can't say much about anything
    beyond this range, I can't see that far.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="+1"><b>Soloing</b></font></p>
    <p>Soloing is never really easy, and it's not nearly as much fun as grouping, but so far
    as the ability to do it goes a Paladin is pretty good. I have probably soloed about 4-5
    levels in total (besides 1-5). Paladins are good at soloing mainly because after level 9
    you can heal yourself during combat instead of running when it gets hairy. Really tough
    monsters will interrupt you when casting, but whites and under usually will not (depends).
    With practice, you can become fairly adept at tabbing between yourself and your target to
    heal. Always keep buffs on, and pick a place near a wall or corner. This was you have
    50%-75% less area to keep a watch for monsters wanting to join your fight. Of course,
    always have a clear exit to run (preferably with guards). I suggest you do NOT rely on Lay
    Hands to beat tough monsters unless the payoff is enormous (like if you see a monster
    carrying a great weapon or something). This practice is good once, but since you can't do
    it consistantly, it's not worth being screwed later on because you used your Lay Hands.
    When you solo, you need to take single blues one after another as fast as possible with
    Lay Hands as a backup. You should not take one Yellow or Red per hour+half then blues
    after that.</p>
    <p>he best thing to do is to run up, hit a single blue, then run back to your cubby hole
    (drawing the monster back) to finish it at levels before 15. Rinse and repeat. This is the
    basic process for most any character. At level 15, if you solo undead you can stay in your
    cubby hole and draw single undead to you with Ward Undead. When doing this, conserve mana
    for healing.</p>
    <p>Use one Ward Undead to draw then hold off and just melee it. If it starts going bad,
    heal yourself and duke it out. If it goes well and the monster flees, hit it with WU again
    so you don't have to follow and expose yourself to more risk. You can also use Lull Undead
    to take only a single monster when there are two, although I rarely found this to be worth
    doing.</p>
    <p>At level 22 you get Root to make them stay put. This is very important since by then
    you will be doing more damage faster, and monsters will tend to flee earlier and bring
    back really tough nasties if you let them. Root is essential to solo at later levels.</p>
