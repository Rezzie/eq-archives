        <p><font face="Arial"><font COLOR="#808000"><strong><big>January 22 - </big></strong></font><font COLOR="#000000">Greetings
        all! The Paladins of Norrath event was a great success(screenshots are
        coming)! About 80 Paladins attended and met at the Tunnel in East
        Commons at about 9:20(after Xegony came back up). We all zoned in to
        West Freeport and pushed the population to 104 before the zone crashed.
        Someone pulled 5 Militia to us and they were all quickly dispatched.
        Only Waylan, a level 14 Paladin was a casualty. Valor Fireheart pulled
        Sir Lucan D'Lere and his Guards outside the city. Many came to Hail Sir
        Lucan. A Dark Elf Shadowknight attacked Sir Lucan but quickly ran for
        his life. Valor Fireheart came back and brought Sir Lucan to Romidar and
        his Companions. The fight was mighty! Over 50 Paladins jumped into the
        fray and destroyed the Corrupt Militia's Leader. Sir Lucan arose from
        his corpse and once more attacked our Fine Paladins. After another short
        disconnect, Sir Lucan had fallen, again! Romidar was barely able to
        swing his blade in the fray, but knelt down and pulled the Testament
        from the Skeleton! We all headed back to the tunnel and by 11:30,
        Romidar returned wielding SoulFire! It was truly superb! All in all, I&nbsp;had
        a great time and really appreciate everyone's participation and
        enthusiasm. To sum up the night, a Paladin made a noble statement that
        went something like this, &quot;What other class would come together
        across ALL&nbsp;of the Servers to assist one of their own?&quot; I am
        proud to be a Paladin of Norrath!</font></font></p>

        <p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Arial">Greetings All!<br>
        Here is the plan.<br>
        Friday, January 21 - 9:00 to 11:00pm EST<br>
        Location : Xegony - East Commons Tunnel.<br>
        We will all get together for a real time chat and lots of Bog Juice!<br>
        We will start off the evening by raiding Freeport at about 9:40. We will
        assault the Corrupt Militia and take down Sir Lucan! Romidar Trueblade,
        our Guest of Honour for his glorious work for Paladins shall receive the
        looted prize from Sir Lucan's corpse! A small token of our gratitude.<br>
        From there, we can head back to the East Commons Tunnel and have some
        duels, cheer for Verant's good sense and drink more Bog Juice!<br>
        Please have /ooc turned on and I(Varrus) will keep everyone updated on
        the situation. :-) We want the assault to be as painless as ever.<br>
        See you Friday!<br>

        There are quite a few high level Paladins on Xegony that frequent our

        Paladin if someone has a better idea for the Server.&nbsp; It would be
        great to have a realtime chat with the Paladins on the Forums!&nbsp;

        <p><font face="Arial"><big><font COLOR="#808000"><strong>January 17 - </strong></font></big><font COLOR="#000000">Good
        news!&nbsp; In case any of you have missed it, Abashi gave Paladins a
        major overhaul.&nbsp; They have basically touched on ALL of our
        weaknesses and put us on the road to happiness. :-)&nbsp; Romidar, I am
        sure everyone here thanks you wholeheartedly, you are one who deserves
        his title.&nbsp; Here is the news, clipped from the Gameplay Forum :</font></font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><i><small>Hello all, I said I'd stop in tonight and let you know
          what was decided. As of the next patch, Paladins and SKs will receive
          additional hitpoints, and increased caps on bash and taunt.<br>
          The additional hitpoints will be noticeable for Paladins and SKs over
          level 25. This was done because the Paladins, SKs, and Rangers had the
          same HP base, which was incorrect. This change will basically put
          Paladin and SK HPs midway between rangers and warriors of the same
          race.</small></i></p>
          <p><i><small>The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in
          particular, Paladins could not taunt opponents off of Rangers, Monks,
          Rogues, and Warriors due to their lower damage output. Though the
          Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt,
          this change in addition to some of the taunting spells should help
          them fulfill their role as a tank.</small></i></p>
          <p><i><small>Bash was increased because Paladins typically aren't
          switching to two handed weapons, choosing instead of using the bash
          skill. Most warriors, being ogres, trolls, or barbarians for the most
          part, do not worry about bash and instead opt for slam, which uses the
          same skill. Paladins are typically the only characters who use a
          shield throughout their lives.</small></i></p>
          <p><i><small>The problem of an AC disparity between Paladins/SKs and
          rangers still exists due to the ranger class-specific armor typically
          having an AC that is too high. We'll be further examining the AC
          disparity over the coming weeks, and will address it with items.</small></i></p>
          <p><i><small>Additionally, the need for Paladin/SK 1H weapons above
          that of the Ghoulbane has been brought to the attention of our Live
          team (the item/quest people). Quite frankly, if you are still wielding
          a GB in the high 40s, you aren't doing the damage you should be doing.
          However it's apparent that Paladins (and the smaller SKs) prefer to
          retain their bash.</small></i></p>
          <p><i><small>Also, the Armor of Ro should be more obtainable after the
          next patch. The class-specific mid-level armor in general is still
          being analyzed and will improve over the next few patches.</small></i></p>
          <p><i><small>Finally, Fear will drop more items. I was able to obtain
          several pieces for each class upon testing it last night.</small></i></p>
          <p><i><small>-Gordon</small></i></p>

        <p><small><font FACE="Arial">Abashi mentioned on the gameplay forum that
        there is a known bug with AC. It is known to definitely affect Paladins,
        but other classes could be bugged also. A patch should be on the Test
        Server soon to fix it.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Arial">Basically the bug &quot;caps&quot; AC so that the
        AC number displayed in the information screen cannot raise past a
        certain point regardless of equipment or spells.</font></small></p>
