        Cindersmash sent me in an editorial he has written on the Paladin class.
        Please give it a <a HREF="../edit5.htm">read</a> and post any thoughts
        you might have on the General Board. If YOU&nbsp;would like me to post
        your thoughts or a specific topic to discuss, please do not hesitate to
        send it in to paladin@lweb.net. The Seekers of Lore were added to the
        Links section. I have added a new <a HREF="../story7.htm">story:Spinning
        Thread</a>, to the Story section. It was sent in by....I&nbsp;deleted
        the email after getting the file! There is no name on the story, please
        send me your name and we can fix it up. It's a great story!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>October 27 - </b></font>Posting
        the info I&nbsp;received from Benton D'Marr last night. Thanks Benton!
        The Armour of Ro Info is almost complete. Just need a screenshot of a
        full suit and stats for Bracers and Helm. Until then, Benton is the
        model. :-) The Armour of Ro Guide is almost complete. Just tracking down
        some required info for faction improvements. Please check the General
        Board today and drop me some info if you know it. I&nbsp;will try and
        get that posted before lunch is done.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>October 25 - </b></font>Well, I
        have started the Definitive Guide to the Armour of Ro. :-) It may be a
        tough one, but with everyone's help we can work on it together! Verant
        has officially altered the Quest for the Armour by lowering the
        Blacksmith skill requirement to 101. While this is not enough in most
        people's eyes, they have at least acknowledged our response. Now if they
        would only give our Armour a half decent AC&nbsp;I&nbsp;could put up
        with the CRAZY Quest requirements! I want to see our AC close to
        Warriors, less of course, but how about better than Shamans?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>October 21 - </b></font>It has
        been done. Krispinn successfully made the Greaves of Ro! I have posted
        the stats of it on the <a HREF="../roarmour.htm">Armour of Ro page</a>.
        Beldukil also posted the stats on 4 other pieces that Benton D'Marr
        successfully made. I have no screenshots yet and would like to post
        them. Send them to <a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a>.
        Because of the AC, many Paladins would like to express their displeasure
        to Verant. Namely, that Rangers and Bards have higher AC than Paladins
        do? It is my understanding that we as Paladins, sacrificed offensive
        power to gain a higher AC(through Plate) and the ability to Heal.
        Rangers, unable to wear Plate, and capable of dealing more damage,
        prefer offense over defense. This is no longer the case when comparing
        Quest armour. It is either equivalent or greater than the Armour of Ro.
        Brad McQuaid visited our site the other day and scans many sites daily.
        We could put together a petition but I&nbsp;am fairly certain he is
        getting a good idea of the situation now. Maybe in a couple of days,
        after he has been given time to respond, we can decide on a course of
        action. I&nbsp;have posted a Comments post on the General Board for your
        comments.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>October 17 - </b></font>Ah,
        Questing away, away, away and away. I have not spent too much time on
        the Armour of Ro yet, but have spent a couple of nights in West Commons
        looking for a Nightfall Giant. Haven't seen one yet! :-/ Roajin
        Wraithbane posted an interesting <a HREF="../letter.htm">letter and
        response</a> he received from Brad McQuaid. What do you think? Is the
        Armour of Ro Quest too involved? I haven't seen anyone running around
        with any on yet, while I have seen Shaman, Necros, Bards and Rangers in
        suits that are almost complete. I would rather our Armour be difficult
        to achieve, but is this too difficult? Ah well, I&nbsp;will continue my
        Questing this eve, TFC and AoE II have snuck in on my playtime. Both are
        Great Games! Good Luck on your Quests. Still looking for screenshots and
        stats on Armour of Ro. Please send them to: <a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net.</a></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>October 11 - </b></font>Happy
        Thanksgiving Everyone! I have posted the information on the Armour of
        Ro. Aziraphale was on the Test Server and posted this information on the
        General Message Board. The link is off of the Armour and Weapons page,
        or <a HREF="../ro.htm">here</a>. Thanks a lot Az! One other GREAT&nbsp;comment.
        GB was not camped last night on Xegony. Our party fought our way down
        there, was almost there and saw a group of DE's and a Troll run past us
        invis. They set up camp in the Shin Lord room. They informed us they
        were camping GB for a level 16 Pally that the DE&nbsp;Wizard had. Hmph!
        I petitioned to ask a Guide about Ghoulbane. The Guide answered my
        petition about an hour later. He said he could not do anything for me
        and that DE's were allowed to camp GB. No problem, I&nbsp;agreed. Then I
        said, &quot;When will GB&nbsp;BE&nbsp;NO&nbsp;DROP?&quot;. He told me
        that GB&nbsp;WILL&nbsp;become a Quest item and will therefore be No
        Drop! Yippee! Verant has finally listened! It sounded like the GB&nbsp;Quest
        will become part of the patch on Tuesday. Now I wonder how they will
        rationalize killing a Frogluck Paladin? *smile* Have any information you
        would like to send me? Send it to :&nbsp;<a HREF="mailto:paladin@lweb.net">paladin@lweb.net</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>October 7 - </b></font>Have you
        heard of EQ&nbsp;Crossfire? It is a great site that I&nbsp;added to the
        Links page. Azorath is the man behind the scenes, please pay him a
        visit. I have also posted one of his main articles called <a HREF="../edit4.htm">Ruby
        Fever</a> as an Editorial. Parts of it are unbelievable but true! Go to
        the General Message Board and comment on the Editorial if you would
        like. I&nbsp;will post a subject called Editorial - Ruby.</font></p>
