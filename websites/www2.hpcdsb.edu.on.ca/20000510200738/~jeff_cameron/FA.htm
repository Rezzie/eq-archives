    <strong>What it boils down to is this:</strong><br>
    <br>
    Inte will tell you that he needs four things and upon you handing them to him he will give
    you the blade he wields. These four things are two blessings, the head of Miragul and the
    Robe of Miragul. The blessings are received from Inte when you give him items that prove
    a)your nobility and b) your sacrifice.<br>
    <br>
    The first blessing, nobility, is received from giving him a Soulfire. <br>
    <br>
    The second blessing, sacrifice, is recieved from giving him a Ghoulbane. <br>
    <br>
    The head of Miragul can be found by killing the Lich of Miragul in Everfrost.<br>
    <br>
    The challenge to obtain the final component, the Robe of Miragul, is where things get
    interesting. Indeed it seems it will be necessary to bring back Miragul from the dead (or
    undead as the case may be) and defeat him to obtain his robe. But how to do this? Well, it
    seems the two book parts dropped from the dragons can be combined to form the book of
    scale. The book of scale can then be given to the Oracle in OOT who will then present you
    with a most interesting item. No, it's not the robe itself but it seems instead a key
    component to getting Miragul reincarnated. How to actually do this though I have no idea.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Facts and History about Miragul(a complete history can be found <a href="miragul.htm">here</a>):</b>
    </font><font color="#000000"><br>
    <br>
    <font face="TAHOMA" size="2"><strong>History:</strong><br>
    <br>
    &quot;...Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling life energies
    to make a portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he
    withdrew silently to his most secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all
    the while of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate
    experiment. The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul hid his
    remaining and fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered from the
    other necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then dispersed, revealing a
    shell of the man Miragul once was, an undead mage, what ancient scripts and legends called
    a lich. In his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich, while
    retaining all the mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage&#146;s
    soul, now locked within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and
    desire to amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these human
    traits, and Miragul&#146;s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began to
    aimlessly wander his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with
    artifacts of power.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Facts:</strong><br>
    <br>
    He is a necro skeleton mob in the caves in Everfrost(The ones you need to swim to get to)
    He is not hard for a 40+ group of 6. Was blue to me at level 49. He often wanders and
    tends to stay close to the entrance to the caves near the water. He drops his head when
    killed. I would assume that his spawn time is about 4-5 hours like most all other quest
    mobs but this is not confirmed. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Information about the Book of Scale as related to Miragul:</b> </font><br>
    <br>
    <font face="TAHOMA" size="2">&quot;We combined the books and gave the &quot;Book of
    Scale&quot; to the Oracle, who then tells you something about ressurecting yourself will
    lead to total chaos in Norrath (whats wierd is he refers to you and not Miragul). What he
    gives you is in fact &quot;Miragul's Phylactery&quot;. The item is no drop so whoever
    turns in the book must be able to do the next part of the quest. The person who completed
    it on our server was an SK. I, like you guys, figured the first thing to do with the item
    would be to give it to Miragul, the problem is he is KOS to everyone. Some things I would
    like to try are to see if a necro in their skeleton form is KOS, also the item has a blank
    effect on it. My guess is that this time its not a mistake on the item unlike many other
    new items in the game. I think you click on miragul and then activate the item with a
    right click. This is just a guess though, and I look forward to seeing what other people
    try.&quot;<br>

    Here are some definitions of a phylactery submitted by Beldukil Lawbringer of the Povar
    Server. Definition #3 seems to fit in the case of Miragul.<br>
    <br>
    phylactery \Phy*lac&quot;ter*y\, n.; pl. Phylacteries. [OE. filateri, OF. filatire,
    filatiere, F. phylact[`e]re, L. phylacterium, Gr. ?, fr. ? a watcher, guard, ? to watch,
    guard. Cf. Philatory.]<br>
    1. Any charm or amulet worn as a preservative from danger or disease.<br>
    2. A small square box, made either of parchment or of black calfskin, containing slips of
    parchment or vellum on which are written the scriptural passages Exodus xiii. 2-10, and
    11-17, Deut. vi. 4-9, 13-22. They are worn by Jews on the head and left arm, on week-day
    mornings, during the time of prayer. --Schaff-Herzog Encyc.<br>
    3. Among the primitive Christians, a case in which the relics of the dead were inclosed. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>A speculation about liches:</b> </font><br>
    <br>
    <font face="TAHOMA" size="2">concerning liches...you can kill a lich as much as you like
    but it is never truly destroyed until you destroy their &quot;soul jar&quot;...basically a
    high level necro discorporates their soul and stores it in a holding device, most often
    referred to as a jar, that way if their body gets destroyed, they still have their soul
    and can then inhabit another body, then discorporate again, etc<br>
    <br>
    now the plane NPC says he was never able to defeat miragul, and would love his head as a
    trophy...ok fine, done deal go kill the lich and get a head<br>
    <br>
    suppose for the other part (robe i think?) you have to *truly* destroy miragul, which
    means destroying his soul....so how exactly does one do this? just drop the
    &quot;jar&quot; and break it and poof he's dead? probably not...i can just see having to
    find some special NPC who knows how to destroy the soul of a lich (for 2000pp of course)
    and then rewards you with the robe or something....just a thought but sort of makes sense
    a bit...of course, maybe giving miragul his soul would corporate <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Speculation about the next steps:</b> </font><br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="TAHOMA" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;I think you might have to give
    the Phylactery to Akera to get him to spawn the Lich of Miragul, whom you then kill on the
    4th island in the plane of sky to get the robe&quot; - Yukitaro Antslayer, KEG GM, The
    Rathe<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There are NPCs in Paineel who respond to questions about Miragul. Actually they
    refer to him as Myragul. Also, there is a &quot;tormented soul&quot; there that will not
    respond to my erudite shadowknight. One NPC who responded to questions about Myragul also
    responded to a question about the Oracle of Marud.&quot; - Avarus, LoD, Innoruuk Server<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The tortured soul is currently the front runner for the Myragul Robe quest. Now all
    we need is for an evil acolyte to take Myragul's Phylactery to the tortured soul and then
    bring 20 or so friends and be prepared for a decent fight.&quot; - Drool Darklighter <br>

    spawns Miragul and you kill him for the Robe and Head (exact same head as before so I'm
    betting the Robe was added after his lichness dropped his head by error)<br>
    <br>
    HOW? Well there are lots of ways. You can have the Lich Harmonied and then sneak up on him
    from behind and give it to him. You can apparently use illusions + mes + mind wipe to hand
    it to him.<br>
