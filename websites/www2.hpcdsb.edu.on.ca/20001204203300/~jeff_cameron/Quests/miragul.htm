        <p align="center"><font color="#000000"><strong><big><big>&nbsp;</big></big></strong></font>Over
        three thousand years in the past humanity was in its infancy. Mankind
        dwelled in<br>
        the center of Antonica, spreading out slowly to inhabit the vast and
        fertile plains of<br>
        Karana. Villages appeared and prospered, several reaching the size of
        towns, and two<br>
        even became cities -- Qeynos to the west, and Freeport to the east.
        Humanity, much<br>
        to the disdain of the elder races who watched from afar, was strong --
        it rapidly gained<br>
        a solid foothold in the world of Norrath and was there to stay.<br>
        <br>
        This is not to imply, however, that humanity was at peace. Early on
        small groups<br>
        formed, some linked by similar appearances, others by common goals.
        Competition was<br>
        fierce, and when resources grew scarce for one reason or another many
        groups<br>
        abandoned the promises and alliances of their past and fought. A few
        leaders spoke<br>
        out against the violence, urging the masses to remember why they had
        fled the cold<br>
        north. They had broken away from the lands of Halas and their barbarian
        brothers in<br>
        the name of peace, and these leaders insisted that humanity adhere once
        again to<br>
        those principals to which all had agreed.<br>
        <br>
        Their cry was not totally ignored, and the fighting subsided. Villages
        were encouraged<br>
        to trade with one another and to respond to competition nonviolently. An
        economy<br>
        based largely on agriculture appeared and the villages and small towns
        were<br>
        surrounded by large farms. Most of humanity’s leaders were pleased
        with this, wanting<br>
        nothing more than peace and food on every man’s table after a hard day
        of work. A<br>
        few, however, wanted more. Even though their people had risen well
        beyond the<br>
        standard of living endured by their barbarian brothers to the north,
        they were not<br>
        content. Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales of
        elves, dwarves,<br>
        and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient
        abandoned cities. A few<br>
        even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and the mystic arts.
        And when that<br>
        discontent minority of leaders heard all of this, they became both
        jealous and<br>
        determined.<br>
        <br>
        A small, fragile man of great intellect called Erud led this group, and
        he formed them<br>
        into a council. They quickly became irritated, even disgusted, by their
        fellow man.<br>
        Leaving a small network of spies behind, the remainder of Erud’s
        followers fled the city<br>
        of Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west
        and landed upon<br>
        the barren coast of the island of Odus. The land was sparse and
        uninhabited and quite<br>
        appealing to the council and their people. They quickly built a city of
        their own,<br>
        dissimilar in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was
        almost entirely a<br>
        towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within it the scribes and
        scholars, who called<br>
        themselves High Men, gathered and analyzed reports, captured books and
        scrolls, and<br>
        other artifacts brought to them by their spies. The first human mages
        were then born<br>
        – wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the great halls of
        Erudin and grew<br>
        immensely in both power and knowledge.<br>
        <br>
        One of the more adept practitioners of the arts was named Miragul.
        Unlike and more<br>
        extreme than the others, he not only abhorred his human brothers on the
        mainland to<br>
        the east, but he also grew to hate his fellow Erudites. To him they were
        both short<br>
        sighted and narrow. They created schools of thought, categorizing magic
        into three<br>
        groups and assigning themselves to three classes: Wizards, Sorcerers,
        and<br>
        Enchanters. Miragul found this limiting and thoroughly resented the
        thought of being<br>
        restricted to one school of thought or another.<br>
        <br>
        He soon found others who felt similarly. They were a small but growing
        group of<br>
        outcasts who often studied forbidden texts and other knowledge generally
        kept secret<br>
        from the majority of students. The council was morally and ethically
        opposed to much<br>
        of the information gathered afar by their spies. Miragul found that
        these outcasts not<br>
        only studied the three schools of magic, but also a fourth. It was
        called Necromancy<br>
        and a few lucky spies had returned from a distant underground city (Neriak,
        it was<br>
        called, home of the dark elves) with both their lives and also ancient
        texts describing<br>
        this art. Miragul was intrigued, and, by using powerful magic, created
        for himself four<br>
        identities, four separate countenances and names, and joined all four
        schools without<br>
        the knowledge of the council, nor anyone else for that matter.<br>
        <br>
        It came to pass some years later that the council, in its ever growing
        desire to know all<br>
        there was to know, both in distant lands and also in its own city,
        discovered the group<br>
        of Necromancers. They were branded heretics and great conflict arose.
        For the first<br>
        time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a
        civil war not<br>
        entirely dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from back on
        the mainland.<br>
        But there was one very significant difference – they did not use
        swords and bows, but<br>
        rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the hundreds were
        lost, great<br>
        buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics were
        forced to flee<br>
        Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern regions of Odus.<br>
        <br>
        Miragul, being a member of all four schools, was not blind to the
        implications when the<br>
        conflict began. He left the heretics before they fled the city,
        abandoning his fourth<br>
        identity and siding apparently with the council. But this was only a
        ruse in order to buy<br>
        time. He soon gathered every artifact and tome he could discreetly steal
        and then left<br>
        Odus entirely, taking a ship back to Antonica and to the city of Qeynos.
        The lands of<br>
        men, however, were not only to his dislike, but also filled with Erudite
        spies. Miragul<br>
        grew afraid, even paranoid, and soon fled again. He headed far to the
        north and then<br>
        to the east, wishing to avoid the barbarians of Halas. After many weeks
        he found<br>
        himself near the great lake called Winter’s Deep and he hid there for
        some time.<br>
        <br>
        While Miragul waited in secret his mind was not idle. He schemed and
        planned, and<br>
        looked over every letter of every scroll and tome he had taken from
        Erudin. Time<br>
        passed and his understanding and power grew. But he was unsatisfied and
        a deep<br>
        hunger for even more arcane knowledge ate away at him. He soon left his
        hiding place<br>
        and began to travel long distances in search of more ancient texts and
        artifacts. His<br>
        power had grown and confidence overcame his fear of Erudite spies. Once
        again he<br>
        cloaked himself in false identity and countenance and traveled the lands
        of men.<br>
        <br>
        Not far to the south of where his cache of artifacts lay, Miragul soon
        found another of<br>
        the new races, the Halflings, and their town Rivervale. The mage feared
        these small<br>
        people and their propensity to sneak and to steal, and as his treasures
        grew in both<br>
        size and value, he eventually made the decision to move even farther
        north, and away<br>
        from all intelligent life. He traveled leagues and leagues, far beyond
        the range of both<br>
        Erudite spy and curious Halfling, and eventually came to a vast tundra.
        This land had<br>
        no name, and was not until centuries later referred to as merely the
        Frigid Plain. This<br>
        frosty and remote environment appealed to Miragul’s heart, for it had
        grown cold,<br>
        obsessed with only knowledge and the abstract, and filled with only
        hatred for others.<br>
        Creatures with intelligence forced him to be discreet and slowed his
        acquisition of<br>
        knowledge and items. He had as little to do with them as he could, only
        hiding amongst<br>
        them when absolutely necessary.<br>
        <br>
        Under the icy ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large
        network of tunnels<br>
        and rooms in which to hide and study his collection. He used no labor,
        but rather deep<br>
        magic to remove the earth from his way. Room after room, passage after
        passage, he<br>
        did create to house his store of artifacts. He split his years, spending
        one score out in<br>
        the world, exploring and amassing knowledge and items, returning them to
        his cache,<br>
        and then the next dabbling with them, experimenting in one of several
        laboratories he<br>
        had created.<br>
        <br>
        Many years passed, even centuries. Miragul grew old, even though he did
        his best to<br>
        extend his life using magical means. There was a limit to his
        enlightenment when it<br>
        came to aging, and he soon acknowledged that one day even he would die.
        Only one<br>
        aspect of death did he fear, and being no longer able to learn and
        collect wrought him<br>
        with terror. As his skin grew wrinkled, and his breath short,
        Miragul’s time was spent<br>
        less exploring the world of Norrath and more studying the existential.
        He soon<br>
        discovered the various hidden dimensions that neighbored his own, the
        Planes of<br>
        Power and Discord. He discovered means by which he could traverse these
        planes,<br>
        making portals that led between them. But his strength was leaving him,
        and his<br>
        journeys into these realities were short and often unprofitable. More
        and more, his own<br>
        mortality limited his reason for living, and the specter of death
        haunted him daily.<br>
        <br>
        The mage’s research into life and death was built upon a foundation he
        had learned<br>
        from his fellow outcasts centuries before in Erudin. Necromancy, more
        than any other<br>
        art, became Miragul’s obsession. Eventually he discovered a means by
        which to create<br>
        portals within his own plane and made them to travel great distances in
        mere seconds.<br>
        He traveled back to Odus, to its southern regions, in search of the
        other<br>
        Necromancers. Perhaps, he mused, they had unearthed by now a way to
        cheat death.<br>
        <br>
        The mage soon found that the heretics of Erudin had built a city into a
        great hole that<br>
        led to unknown depths beneath the earth. This chasm was apparently the
        result of<br>
        that huge civil war from which Miragul had fled centuries earlier. The
        city, called Paineel,<br>
        though somewhat suspicious, allowed Miragul to enter and after a time he
        earned its<br>
        inhabitant’s trust. Many humored the old man and his claims, while a
        select few<br>
        respected him and were willing to trade knowledge for knowledge, power
        for power.<br>
        They revealed to him the true power of necromancy, the ability to raise
        the dead,<br>
        creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to their master. Many
        of the<br>
        heretics planned to assault Erudin with vast armies of undead, to wreak
        revenge upon<br>
        the council that had exiled and made war upon them in centuries past.<br>
        <br>
        One important aspect of their necromancy interested Miragul, the fact
        that the undead<br>
        ceased to age. Their lives appeared endless and the elderly mage knew
        that he must<br>
        discover a way to be like them. He feigned interest in the heretic’s
        goals, learning spells<br>
        to raise the dead, helping them raise their undead army. All the while,
        however, he was<br>
        experimenting himself, hiding much of his research in the small home he
        was given in<br>
        Paineel. After some time he discovered that which he had sought, a way
        to transform a<br>
        living being, as opposed to a corpse, into the undead. Unfortunately,
        time was scarce,<br>
        for he was tired and almost dead himself, his body deteriorating with
        age, and the<br>
        heretics were almost ready to make war once again.<br>
        <br>
        Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling life
        energies to make a<br>
        portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival,
        he withdrew<br>
        silently to his most secret laboratory and prepared his final spell.
        Dreaming all the while<br>
        of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate
        experiment.<br>
        The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul hid
        his remaining<br>
        and fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered
        from the other<br>
        necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then dispersed,
        revealing a shell<br>
        of the man Miragul once was, an undead mage, what ancient scripts and
        legends called<br>
        a lich.<br>
        <br>
        In his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich,
        while retaining all the<br>
        mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage’s
        soul, now locked<br>
        within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition
        and desire to<br>
        amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these
        human traits,<br>
        and Miragul’s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began to
        aimlessly<br>
        wander his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with
        artifacts of<br>
        power.</p>
