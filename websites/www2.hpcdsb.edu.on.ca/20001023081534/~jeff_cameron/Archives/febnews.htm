        Was on course all last week and was not able to complete any PoN
        projects this mopnth. :-/&nbsp; Replay updated his <a href="http://www.cazic-thule.com/replay/pallyfaq/">Paladin
        FAQ</a> and here is a link to the <a href="../ro.htm">Guide to Armour of
        Ro</a>.&nbsp; Things should start moving again soon!</font></font></p>

        Aradune has announced on the Test Server that the Fiery Avenger Quest
        *will* be in this week's patch.&nbsp; I have created a Fiery Avenger
        Knowledge Pool in our Forums so any that wish can share information.
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Best of luck and may Marr's Light guide thee to victory!</font></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><big><strong><font COLOR="#808000">February
        6 - </font></strong></big><font COLOR="#000000">There are many people
        complaining about the recent &quot;upgrade&quot; to our Lay on Hands.&nbsp;
        LoH was supposedly increased from level*25 to level*27.&nbsp; Many have
        tested it and it doesn't seem to work.&nbsp; Why? Oh Why, do they not
        just check your current hps and make that LoH's value?&nbsp; If I am
        level 50 with 1800 hps including Cleric and Shaman buffs, just make LoH
        heal 1800hps.&nbsp; That solves the disposable Paladin problem and makes
        us heal up to our own hps.&nbsp; If we used it on a Warrior it would not
        heal to full, but players of our level or <em>less</em> would be healed.
        &nbsp; If they want to get picky, even base LoH on natural hps.&nbsp;
        Making an easy solution difficult.&nbsp; Working on Armour pages!&nbsp;
        Posting them soon!</font></font></p>

        Paladins!&nbsp; When you are excited and run to the closest forge in
        Freeport to make your first piece of Ro Armour, DO NOT USE AN OVEN.
        &nbsp; *grins*&nbsp; That's right, I ran to the Oven beside the bank,
        never looked at the title and combined, losing both my Greaves mold and
        bar of HARD WON Ronium.&nbsp; Alas, live and learn.&nbsp; I have another
        Nightfall Giant head, just too bad Melatite is so difficult to acquire.&nbsp;
        Unto a new month!&nbsp; I will be fixing up the old Armour description
        pages and I have new updated pics for the Armour of Ro guide.&nbsp; I
        will also be adding stats on each Quest item on its respective page.</font></font></p>
