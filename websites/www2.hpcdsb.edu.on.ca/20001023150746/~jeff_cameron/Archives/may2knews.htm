        the Stories section!&nbsp; Thanks to Lorin Darkbane for a LOT of text to
        edit. :-P&nbsp; EQLinks was added to the General Links.&nbsp; The Spells
        and Equipment sections are still under construction but should be done
        by next week.&nbsp; Ridged D'Avenger sent in an <a href="Editorials/edit7.htm">Editorial</a>

        Guides.&nbsp; There is also a new Story in the Story section and I will

        Greetings all!&nbsp; Have a few things to mention.&nbsp; I had almost
        completed the update to PoN when a harddrive at work DIED.&nbsp; The
        tape backup was about a week old and was corrupted.&nbsp; :-/&nbsp;
        Needless to say, I had two other sites for work that had to get back up.&nbsp;
        I have finally got around to working and restoring the old/new site and
        the template is almost complete.&nbsp; I hope you'll like it!&nbsp; It
        should be coming online within the week.&nbsp; On a good note : one of
        my Companions was fighting in Karnor's last night and looted a pair of
        Deepwater Gauntlets!&nbsp; I was just talking to him and he has them
        saved for me. :-)&nbsp; Woohoo!&nbsp; For all of you wondering, they are
        18AC and the effect is Cancel Magic.&nbsp; Nice!&nbsp; I wonder what
        colour they will be?&nbsp; Anyways, keep up the good work and the new
        site will be here soon enough!</font></p>
