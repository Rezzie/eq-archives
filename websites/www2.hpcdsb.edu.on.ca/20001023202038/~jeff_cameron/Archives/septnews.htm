        the site. Thanks to Sir Farse Remvad of Tarew Marr for the Sharkskin
        Shield stats. I will post this Quest soon. Started a Valorium section
        under Armour. Posted the BSOF Quest. You can get it <a HREF="../bsof.htm">here</a>!
        Added a couple of new links. New site is coming, but still a lot of work
        to do. More to come this week! Keep your eyes out!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>September 20 - </b></font>Well,
        I&nbsp;have the majority of the new site planned out and am writing the
        code for it now. :-) I had a rough EQ weekend and am going to post an
        editorial <a HREF="../edit3.htm">here</a>. Check it out. On the General
        Board, I&nbsp;have posted a thread called EDITORIAL. Please leave some
        comments if you would like.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1"><b>September 3 - </b></font>Making
        good progress on revamping the website. I need a couple of things from
        my Fellow Paladins. Long ago, someone wrote a REALLY&nbsp;good post on
        race considerations. I think it was Beldukil but I&nbsp;am not sure. Can
        anyone write the article? Try to include a Race Chart as well. It was a
        great post and I&nbsp;thought I had saved it but it is missing. I&nbsp;would
        like to apologize for not getting the site improved fast enough. :-)
        This is my busiest time of the year but will have time within the next
        couple of months to improve things. The message boards are quite busy
        and on the whole, the discussions are great.</font></p>
