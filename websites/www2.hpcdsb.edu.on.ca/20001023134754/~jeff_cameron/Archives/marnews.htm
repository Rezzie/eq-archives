        2h weapons the same -- sorry in advance.</small></font></strong></p>

        and that brings the Knowledge Pool to its completion.&nbsp; The past
        couple of weeks were great fun and apart from the last day, was a great
        success.&nbsp; I will leave the Forum up for a couple of more days and
        the remove it as it has served its purpose.&nbsp; Romidar Trueblade and
        Interslayer have both voluntarily stepped down as Moderators.&nbsp; I
        received 2 more pieces of player artwork!&nbsp; They are great and you

        sections and have been adding sites.&nbsp; The Fiery Avenger Quest is
        moving right along.&nbsp; Hottoq and company gave us a lot of valuable
        information and Drool Darklighter seems to be leading most with his
        experiences and information.&nbsp; Although not all that come to the
        Fiery Avenger Knowledge Pool come for a good purpose, the majority enjoy
        and appreciate all the work that is being done. &nbsp; Please do not get
        discouraged!&nbsp; Keep the ideas coming.&nbsp; This is *THE* best point
        of all Quests we have experienced.&nbsp; No one knows the next step and
        people are racking their brains coming up with ideas.&nbsp; I remember
        when we all worked together to solve Soulfire and it was truly a great
        time for innovation and friendship. &nbsp; Put aside the posts you think
        do not help and post to others that are stuck or offer ideas!&nbsp; The
        Fiery Avenger Knowledge Pool has been a stunning success and will
        continue to do so until that Blade finds a Paladin's hand!</font></font></p>

        Interslayer and Bephsi are now moderators to our Forums! &nbsp; Thank
        you very much for the help and have fun!&nbsp; There has been some
        incredible information posted on the Fiery Avenger forum and they *may*

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><font COLOR="#808000"><big>March
        2 - </big></font></strong><font COLOR="#000000">I have received numerous
        emails about the need for a moderator for our Fiery Avenger Knowledge
        Pool.&nbsp; Interslayer, Bephsi, Romidar and Hooloo have been nominated
        or volunteered their services.&nbsp; I will post a discussion on the FA
        forum and you can decide on who would like to do it.&nbsp; With that out
        of the way, I just thought I would explain why I did not move quickly on
        picking a moderator.&nbsp; First of all, we really haven't found the
        Quest, so to me, almost any information is still relevant.&nbsp; Even
        though Nennon has been heavily criticized, it is possible that his
        information is the best we have.&nbsp; I haven't had the time to keep up
        with everyone and I haven't even been able to play much.&nbsp; Even
        though the majority of all the Nennon-talk going on has been flames,
        there is still some information that may prove valuable to some.&nbsp; I
        have a hard time believing that you end up paying some obscure NPC a lot
        of money to start the Quest but remember, a human wrote the Quest and is
        bound by human capabilities(read illogical).&nbsp;&nbsp; So, when you
        decide who will moderate the Forum via the posts, I will contact the
        lucky people(2) and we will be VERY careful on what we delete so you can
        decide what is valid and what is not for yourself.</font></font></p>
