Greetings.  I see you have found your way to <i>The Harpers at Twilight</I>.  So, do you think you have what it takes to join this small but vigourous guild?  Does anyone ever know their true measure?  I am just a simple member of this fine guild, but if you ever see me in Hibernia, and express an interest, it is in my power to initiate you into our ranks as an apprentice.  Take care though.  The road you are about to travel is not an easy one.  You may want to look over the ideals we hold dear.  Once you read that, maybe you can find out a little more about us.<P></font>

<B>16 Dec 01</B> - More links added.  Now we can communicate with members of the Alliance.  Still working on membership and the membership page.  Right now my focus is on levelling and getting my tradeskill up.  Wait for the new year!<P>
<B>29 Nov 01</B> - Got the links page updated.  Still looking for actual information from our members.  Also, if anyone has graphics or content they want to send me, please do so at <A HREF="mailto:brightblades@msn.com">brightblades@msn.com</A>.<P>
<b>27 Nov 01</b> - Updated this web page to be a little more informative.  I am still collecting information from the guild leader to fill out that page, so most of the information is scetchy and incomplete.<P>
<B>26 Nov 01</b> - <I>The Harpers at Twilight</i> are recruiting!!!!!  Feel free to look us up in-game and ask about the guild.  You can also e-mail one of our members from the member's page or post on our message board.<P>
<B>17 Nov 01</B> - I made a message board.  Now if I could only get people to post there!<P>
<B>6 Nov 01</B> - Larian is famous!  It seems my Ranger Guide is rather popular.  Not a bible by any means, but it seems people are enjoying it.<P>
<B>29 Oct 01</B> - Larian is invited into <i>The Harpers at Twilight</I>!  I like the name, and I am familiar with the <a href=adnd.html><i>Forgotten Realms</i></a> reference.<P>

<I>The Harpers at Twilight</I> are a very small group of roleplayers on the Guinevere Server in The Dark Age of Camelot, in the Hibernia realm.  We are always looking for new members, so please look us up and let us know.  Currently this is the only web page out there that talks about the guild, but I am trying to get more information out there so we can become better known.  Right now we are mostly folks in the level ranges of 12 to 25.  We actively roleplay, get involved in RvR, and in general support each other in any way we can.<P>
Many of you may be familiar with the Harpers of Forgotten Realms fame.  This is basically what we are trying to emulate.  <P>
