My favorite persona is the Kurgan.  I love combat decks, and he's the most brutal.  
I also like to play Slan and Connor.  I have a lot of promo cards and Quickenings that 
make these decks even more brutal.  Imagine facing Connor with Slan's and Kurgan's 
quickening.  Just hope you have a few Divine Interventions in your deck!

<p>

</center>
<p>
For my Kurgan deck, (without giving away my entire deck) I play with Kurgan's Follow-Up.
  I start it off with a regular attack, and then with a slash.
  Normally this isn't anything to most people, but with Kurgan's +1 damage,
it starts to eat away at your ability.  If I'm playing with Quickenings, 
I start off with a slash, and then do a power blow.  I use a lot of ripostes 
(all to the same spot).  They'll run out of blocks soon enough.  
Just to make things nastier, I try to get a couple of Master's Advances out with a 
catwalk or mountain cave.  I always play with a Carl or two, just to keep them from 
running away like the cowards they are.
<p>
My Slan deck is not as big as my Kurgan deck because he doesn't have a Follow-up.  
I just power blow them into submission with Master's advances and catwalks out.  
Then, with my Pre Game Darius, I get a couple of Shooting Blades off.  
Not as versatile as the Kurgan, but still mighty effective.  Slan's intimidate is a 
great card to frustrate your opponent with.  You're beating him senseless and he can't 
attack back!  Just watch them squirm.
<p>
Now, I didn't used to watch the TV Series, so most of my love for Highlander comes from the 
original movie.  If movies didn't always have the good guy winning, the Kurgan would 
have crushed Connor like a worm, but oh well, he didn't.  I like Connor as a persona for 
Highlander the Card Game because he is a finesse fighter.  The Master's Block/Master's 
Lunge combo is deadly, and I love it.  Using catwalks, mountain caves, Master's Advance, 
Carl, and Connor's diagonal slashes can make life difficult for your opponent.  
As a get away from it trick, I like the It's a Kind of Magic.
<p>
Now, there are a lot of Cheese/Lock/Pedestrian decks out there, and I hate them.  People who play them are sissy slap fight wimps!  I usually Darius in a couple of Katana Run Away Trains, and always play with some Greenfield Hobbies.  I use Upper Hand and Watcher Counters to further frustrate toe cheese deck wimps.
<p>
Well, that's about it for my Highlander page.  Check out the next page for trading and stuff.
<p>
<B><font size=+3>These links are dead since TCG is such a sucky company!  I didn't bother removing them since I figure I shouldn't do any work to help promote this lying and cheating company.  Of course if they ever pay me the $1000 they owe me (since Mar 1999), maybe I'll be a bit kinder to them!<P></font></B>
<A HREF="decks.html"><IMG align=left border=0 SRC="card_button.gif"> Deck Ideas.</a>  I've won tournaments with some of these decks.  Check them out for some great ideas.  I don't update this page too often because I don't want to give away ALL my strategies.  However, it should get you going in the right direction.

<A HREF="hcard.html"><IMG align=left border=0 SRC="card_button.gif"> A list of all my cards that I have, and the ones that I need.</A>  I'm in the process of getting everything I <em>really</em> need, but it never hurts to be on the look-out for things.  Besides, promo cards are hard to get a hold of!  I also have a lot of cards to trade if you need something.  If I can't get it, there are a couple of people out there who can, and I can point you in their direction.
