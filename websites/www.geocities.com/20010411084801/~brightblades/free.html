I know that some of these items are a bit out of date now that Third Edition is out, but some are still usefull for roleplaying and such.<P>
I made a bunch of gaming aids for AD&D that I found to be very useful.  They are in Microsoft Word V7.0 and Microsoft Excel V7.0.  
If you don't have these versions, still try to download them, and you may be able to use them. 
I also found a .WAV file of the Highlander theme.  Just thought you'd enjoy it.  I will be updating this 
page often with more stuff for you to download.  <P>

These things are in no way meant to be Official TSR products, or meant to infringe on 
anyone's copyrights.  I just happened to make these for myself, and other people liked them, so I thought I'd share.<P>
<B>Just to let you know, all the files just pop up on the screen (no file transfer).  You can still save them 
from there.  You'll need to use the back function on your browser to get back to this page though.</B>
<P>

<uL>
<li><A HREF="sheets.xls">Character Sheets for AD&D - 104K (sheets.xls)</A><BR>
These are a bunch of sheets I made to help me keep track of AD&D characters.  They are set up 
for a Skills & Powers game.  They are pretty inclusive, and have sheets for the players and DM.<P>
<li><A HREF="menu.doc">A Comprehensive Menu - 25K (menu.doc)</A><BR>
This is a sample Menu of just about anything a character can order at an Inn.  It really adds 
to the role playing of a game.  If you want to use different economic levels, just add or delete items 
as you see fit.<P>
<li><A HREF="code.doc">The Code of the Harpers - 12K (code.doc)</A><BR>
This is a Forgotten Realms specific creation.  I just turned the whole book into a one page 
reference sheet.  This is also something good for the players to refer to if they happen to join this 
organization.<P>
<li><A HREF="gems.doc">The Magical Properties of Gems - 18K (gems.doc)</A><BR>
This is another Forgotten Realms creation, but it transfers into just about any game world.  It list a whole bunch of 
gems that characters may find, and gives uses besides money for them.<P>
<li><A HREF="crit_hit.zip">Critical Hit Generator per Combat and Tactics - 18K (crit_hit.zip)</A><BR>
Thank you Mr R. Stephen Winter for this program.  You can download this at his page too.  It sure makes the Critical Hits 
from Combat and Tactics easier to do.  (I never could figure it all out with the way the rules were written!)<P>
<li><A HREF="treas.zip">Treasure Hoard Generator - 390K (treas.zip)</A><BR>
This program by <a href="mailto:theicemage@mindspring.com">Brett A. Paul</A> is really cool for those adventures where the party is taking on a 
biggie with a lot of treasure.  Not only does it generate the really good stuff (coins, gems, MAGIC), but it 
also adds in a bunch of mundane items to flesh out the hoard.  Or you can go to his home page at <a href="http://theicemage.home.mindspring.com/">The Ice Mage</a>.<P>
<li><a href="http://www.accessone.com/~ghwerig/Adnd/adnd1.html">RStephen Winter's AD&D page</A><BR>
This fellow web resident had also made a lot of AD&D items that can be used in any campaign.  Enjoy them as much 
as I did.<P>
<li><A HREF="prince.wav">Princes of the Universe - Queen - 276K (prince.wav)</a><BR>
This is the theme song for Highlander the Series.  Just thought it would be Cool.<P>

<li><A HREF="http://www.thefreesite.com/">The Free Site</a><BR>
This page claims to be the source for all sorts of free stuff on the web.  I believe them, there are 
tons of free things to get out there, and they have them conveniently arranged too.<P>

<li><A HREF="http://themes.tierranet.com/">Desk Top Themes for Windows 95</A><BR>
This is a link to a guy who has tons of Desktop themes for Windows 95.  I use the Lord of the Rings one.  
It's really cool, and I think you'll enjoy it.<P>
<li><A HREF="http://www.holodeck3.com/">Star Trek Themes and Stuff</A><BR>
This will get you to Starbase 21.  They have a whole bunch of Star Trek related desktop themes, 
pictures, sounds, and just about anything you can do with a computer.  I recomend the Holodeck 3 
screen saver.<P>
<LI><A HREF="http://aplusart.simplenet.com/aplusart/index.html">A+ Free Art.</A><BR>
A bunch of free graphics that you can use on your page.  They have clipart, backgrounds, bullets, 
animated GIFs, and so on.<P>
<LI><A HREF="http://soundamerica.com/">Sound America.</A><BR>
A bunch of free sounds you can use along with the free art to really spice up your web page.  This is
the sort of fun stuff that makes the web so interesting.<P>
