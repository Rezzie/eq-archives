The following chronology was posted in the Forgotten Realms Mailing list on June 17, 1997.
The authors are <A HREF="mailto:gkrashos@banda.ntu.edu.au">George Krashos</A> and
<A HREF="mailto:jasona@commnections.com">Jason A.</A>, HTML by
<A HREF="mailto:olove@pobox.com">Olaf Krusche</A>.
<BR><HR>
As a service to the list, I thought it would be useful to post a revised
timeline of the Realms that I have made. I stress that it is by no means
totally and utterly complete, but I assure you that it is a sight more
up to date than the one in the FR boxed set (Revised)!:) Please do not
plague the list with "but you forgot..." or "you've misdated ...." posts
as my revised timeline is simply a template for you all to add in your
own stuff and my omissions. Additionally, this timeline does not incorporate
the timeline presented in the Netheril boxed set. Why? Because I don't
have that particular product ... yet! Anyway, enjoy my months of toil through
dusty tomes and mouldering Dragon articles!
<P>-- Krash<P>
Below is some additional information that I've collected, just in
case anyone's interested. (Just as an aside, normally I don't like long
timeline postings, but the FR list has been so slooow lately, I thought
that there might be something here to spark a discussion).
<P>
   Anyway, here's the additional timeline. Let me know if anyone's got
any additional dates.
<P>-- AJA
