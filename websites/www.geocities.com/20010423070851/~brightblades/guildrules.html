<BR><U><CENTER>Our History<BR></U></center>
I have compiled a small history of our guild, taken from the journals of my ancestors. It is my hope that you learn from their words the meaning of our brotherhood.<BR>... It was once said that my very ancestors were the first people to set foot on the shores of Norrath, whether this is true of not doesn't matter. The truth is that my ancestors were great explorers, and kind people. My father has told me many stories of their journeys and for as long as I can remember I have dreamt of the day when I can journey to the far reaches of this great land. <BR>Before I could grow up to see the wonders and joys of Norrath, tragedy struck.  Many of my ancestors and friends were killed in the last rampage of the orcs, including my own father. Our endless struggle with them has gone on long enough, and I have learned the meaning of hate from the Orcs.<BR> Now many moons from that terrible day, I have finally set out on my journey. At first I set out on my path alone, with no one to turn to.  The struggles were many, and the way was hard.  Here I learned the meaning of lonliness.  With the birth of many new days, and the wonders of Norrath to greet each dawn, I continue on my trek.  Recently I found a small handfull of travellers that share my point of view and my desire to explore Norrath. My hope is that we will meet many others on our way... and together we shall set out on this long journey, and together we will finish it, thus learning the meaning of brotherhood....<p>
