<h1>About my Family</h1>
<br>
<img src="family.jpg"><BR>
Finally got a picture Brooke would agree to let the world see!<P>
<br></center>
I had a bunch of pictures of my wife and daugter.  Brooke didn't think it was a good idea to have all these pictures up for the world to see (personal security and all that), so I removed them.  If you are one of my relatives who really wants some pictures, I can always have Brooke Snail Mail you some copies.  Besides, it was getting to be quite the pain to keep this page updated!<P>

<P>
My 
wife had a Web Page too, but I had to delete that too for the same reasons she had me remove the pictures.  All it used to talk about was how happy we are.  Basically, I'm about as happy as 
one can be.  The only complaint I have is that Brooke won't
 let me play on the computer as much as I want to.  But then, 
who can blame her.
<P>
A little more about us.  We met in Dayton, Ohio, in January
 of 1990.  Brooke was working at Chi Chi's Family Resteraunt, 
and I was stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB.  We got married 
on September 19th, 1992.  Since Wright-Patt, we've lived in 
Del Rio, Texas, at Laughlin AFB; Merced, California, at Castle
 AFB;  in Wichita, Kansas, at McConnell AFB; and we now live in Bellevue, Nebraska, at offutt AFB.  
Our daugter Megan was born on June 25th, 1996.  
Brooke used to work as a receptionist and insurance claims representative for eye doctors here in Wichita (and in Dayton), but now she's a stay at home mom (and if you ask me, that's tougher than working).  We figured out it would cost us more for childcare than she would make.  Besides, we want to raise our children instead of a stranger, or babysitter.<P>
I just got stationed at Offutt AFB, in Omaha, Nebraska.  Megan is starting pre-kindergarten now at St. Mary's School.  Brooke also got a part time job there as a school secretary, so that works out great for Megan.  The cool thing about Megan going to that school is that she's already getting a great education.  We're not even catholic!
