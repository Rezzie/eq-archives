I wish I had gone to England (or at least started my company) before I bought half the swords I own.  It sure would have saved me a lot of money.  I don't really recall when I first developed a love for swords and stuff.  I remember as a small child I would pretend to be a Viking on the small island I grew up on.  I would even have my sisters build a fort and I would "attack" it and take all their valuables.  As I grew older, and got into things like AD&D, SCA, and whatever, I started going to Ren Fairs.  At these fairs, I found that I could buy a sword.  I was in heaven.  At 14 years old, I saved like crazy and spent $100 on a Starfire sword.  I still have it, but since I use it in live steel demonstrations, it's a bit beat up now.  After I graduated from college, I would save up and treat myself to an exrtavegant gift every once in a while.  So by the time I started my company, I had 8 very nice swords.  Once I started my company, I filled out my collection very quickly, and it's growing very quickly now.  I hope I can do the same for your collection too.
<P>
I started my company when I got back from a trip to England and saw what swords cost there.  I had just recently
decided that I wanted a Viking blade (to go with a Ren Faire Costume), and was looking to buy one from 
the Noble Collection.  When I saw the same sword in England for a much better price, I started to look 
into actually getting the sword from Spain (where all the Marto swords come from).  Well, instead I got on with a distributor here in the states, and set up shop.  My distributor is basically the same as the all the rest of the sword companies out there, so you'll see the same stuff most places you go.  Unfortunately, my Air FOrce career and the rest of my life has forced me to shut down my company.  I really wish that I could continue my business, but that is the way life goes sometimes.<P>
