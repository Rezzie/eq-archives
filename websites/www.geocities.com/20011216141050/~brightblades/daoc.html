Okay, I just started this page, so bear with me for a bit.  I just got into DAoC Beta 4, and all I am doing at this point is trying to figure out how the game works.  I have collected a few links that should help in that regard.<P>

As far as playing, I am on the Guinevere Server (a Role Playing Server!).  I got the name Larian, and I am a Ranger (of course!).  Now the big challange will be trying to split my time between this and EQ.  Once I figure out which one I like best, I <i>may</I> pick one over the other, but we'll see.  Anyways, enjoy the links, and hope to see you on line somewhere.<P>
I am also trying to put together a little something for my guild <i><a href="harpers.html">The Harpers at Twilight</a></I>.  If any of you know any good graphics from the Forgotten Realms Harper series that I could "borrow" to put together a web site, I'd really appreciate it.
<P>
