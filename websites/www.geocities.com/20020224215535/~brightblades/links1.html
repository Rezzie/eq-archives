Here are a bunch of links to other peoples pages, and to pages on the web we thought were cool.  
Most of these links are about swords, fantasy, role-playing games, the SCA, and... Well, you get the picture. 

Some of them have links back to me, but some of them don't.  Feel free to surf the web, and hopefully 
you'll find some other things of interest.  So far I have given a top recomendation to four sites.  I will limit myself 
to five Top Recomendations.  These will be what I consider the five best sites on the entire World Wide Web about swords (even my 
own site doesn't meet the criteria for this!).<P>
</center><UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.angelic.org/highlander/index.html">The Highlander Sword Shopper's Guide</A><BR>
This is a FANTASTIC page.  Even if you aren't a Highlander fan, it has a ton of really good information 
on what to look for when you buy a sword.  It also talks about the different types of metals used in swords 
that are out there.  Receives my top recomendation!<P>


<LI><A HREF="http://www.aiusa.com/medsword">The Mediæval Sword Resource Site</A><BR>
This is a FANTASTIC page.  A noncommercial site that has a ton of information for the collector, sword buff, 
or just about anyone with questions about swords.  Also receives my top recomendation!<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://swordforum.com/">Sword Forum Magazine Online</A><BR>
This is a FANTASTIC page.  Brought to you by the same folks who brought you the Highlander Sword 
Shopper's Guide.  Except here you can post messages and ask questions about swords. 
It features a discussion forum where industry leading custom swordsmiths meet they've
got some really big names on there.  Tell them I sent you.  
Also receives my top recomendation!
<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.gemlink.com/~rstein/nihonto.htm">The Japanese Sword Index. </A><br>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.netsword.com">NetSword: The Internet Sword and Medieval Weapons Discussion Group</A><BR>
Another forum site.  These guys have 9 forums though, and they not only discuss weapons and swords, but also talk about history and such.  Deffinetly worth a look.<P>

<li><a href="http://www.oldswords.com">Old Swords</a><BR>
