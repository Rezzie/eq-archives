<h1>Some of My Personal Opinions</h1>
<br>
</center>

<!--BODY-->
<b> I know, I <I>STILL</I> havent put anything here.  Too busy playing games and stuff.  Sorry!</B><P>
Stay tuned for updates.  I just started this page, and I need to make my opinions clear and consice.  I promise that they will make for some interesting reading, and hopefully make you think.<P>
The following opinions are my personal opinions.  They in no way reflect the opinions of the US Air Force, GeoCities, Bright Blades, or any other group or organization that I am affiliated with.  If you can't separate a person's opinions and views from the opinions and views of someone else or a group they belong to, I suggest you leave the web immediately.<P>

Topics of my ranting and raving:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Universe: - Basically how I figure we fit into the universe.  May be offensife to more fundementally religous individuals.<P>

<LI>Crime and Punishment: - How I figure we ought to treat criminals and such.  May be offensive to liberals and people with no sence of responsibility.<P>

<LI>The Constitution: - You have rights!  So does everyone else!  Let's try to make this system work.  My opinions on how to do this.<P>

<LI>Civic and Personal Responsibility: - Read <I>Starship Troopers.</I> (Ignore the pulp scifi and concentrate on what Heinlen was trying to say.)  <P>

<LI>The Media: - Remember the troops landing at Mogadishu?  Vietnam War coverage?  Ted Turner should try to set a better example.<P>


</UL>
<P>
Well, that's all I have to say for now.  If I offended you,... well, that wasn't my goal.  If I made you think and stimulated thought, conversation, and debate, well, I guess I did my job.  I welcome your opinions on any subject I may have covered (and any I didn't cover).  Please try to be constructive (you can disagree, agree, or not care, just be intelligent!).  I may or may not reply to any posts you send my way, but I will read them all (I get over 100 E-Mails a day).<P>
Thank you for your time.<p>
