<H2>Here are some of my deck ideas.</H2>

First of all, some basic strategy and philosophy.  I prefer to build small decks.  I consider 55 cards to be just about right.  Any more than that, and you may not get what you need.  Any less than that is cool, but you<I> may </I>be sacrificing something you might need.  Having a small deck allows me to go through it quickly, so I can get back any restricted cards quickly, and replay my strategy.  I use second wind and Nexus to help with the ability loss.  (If it takes me more than twice through to win, then I'm going to lose anyway.)  As far as strategy goes, what you want to do is focus on one thing that your deck is going to do.  Build the least number of cards to accomplis that goal.  Then add any cards that are nessecary to deal with other types of decks (like pedestrian, lock, heal decks).<P>
To deal with pedestrian decks, I like to use an In-Game Darius with a Katana Runaway Train.  This gets rid of most pedestrians.  I may have two of these combos in a tournament in case they tear in it.  I also like to play with a Simple Minds.  It gets rid of all the Situations that are out, but they can still play something out of their hands to lock you down again.  It also makes you get rid of all your situations.  Another thing to play with is a lot of Focuses.  Since they are an edge card, you can play them on just about anything if you don't need them, so they don't clutter up your hand.  Two ways of getting rid of cards you don't need are Master's Stratagems and Elizabeth Vaughs.  Pick one depending on the construction of your deck, or play with one of each.<P>
Well, enough chat, here are the decks.  I'll just list the card, and how many you need, and I'll let you figure out what they do.  These are decks as I've constructed them for tournaments, so you may see some Quickenings and other Promos you don't have.  Don't worry, they work pretty well without them.  All these decks were constructed with the 6 Promo limit in mind.  I guess now that this is no longer a player, you can even make these decks better.<P>
