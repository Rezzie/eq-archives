Here's a picture of me at the office.  30,000 feet up and 300 miles per hour.  (I'm the big one in the middle.)

Here are some more pictures of the sort of thing I do.
<p>
Okay, I've been flying the C-21 for nearly a year now.  Basically I'm a glorified Taxi driver (but isn't that just like the civilian airliners?).  Contrary to popular opinion, not only Generals get rides in the C-21.  Basically anyone that has a military need to go from one place to another can request airlift support and if they have their paperwork in order, they can get a C-21!  I've flown a lot of interesting people to airfields I thought I'd never see while flying the tanker.  My next goal is to get with the E-4 (747) squadron here at Offutt.  That way I won't have to move or anything after my tour here.  Failing that, a job with the 89th at Andrews would also be really cool.  I guess I can just keep hoping that things will keep going my way.
<P>
The fact that the Air Force pays for me to fly still baffles me.  I have the most enjoyable job in the world. This is what a tanker toad's life is like.  Soon I'll be flying the C-21, and I'll let you know what that's like.
Most of the time, we just take off from McConnell AFB, meet up with a receiver, and then come back here and 
shoot multiple approaches.  For the most part, these missions are routine.  We do have some cool receivers, 
such as the B-2 Stealth Bomber, or the F-117, or the Thunderbirds.  It's pretty cool to see these planes 
flying up close and personal.<p>
Sometimes we get to go other places here in the U. S. and fly missions from there.  These missions have been 
quite a lot of fun.  Some of the places I've been to (I remind you, I was working) are Ft. Walton Beach, Napa Valley, 
Tampa, Edwards AFB, Ft. Campbell, KY., Pert, Australia, and a bunch of other places that were a lot of FUN (I mean work).<p>
The most exciting thing has been traveling overseas.<P>
  I've been to Narobi, Kenya.  There I got to go on a real safari in the Masai Mara reserve.  It was amazing!  
I've been to England a few times.  I like it a lot there.  There are usually a lot of things to go see, like old castles, Stonehege, 
and the country side.  I can see why England is home to so many faire tales and such.  They look like they 
really happened there.  I've also been to France, Japan, and other classified locations around the world.  
I've done a lot of travelling on my own, but it's always nicer when you get paid to go someplace instead 
of having to pay yourself!<P>  
If you've been reading all my pages, then you know a little more about what I do from reading about me.  If you skipped that page, go back and see what I'm actually doing in the world of flying.<P>
Well, that's about it for what I do.  One of these days though, I'd like to get a job with the airlines.  
Now that would be the best job in the world!
