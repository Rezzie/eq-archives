Greetings.  I see you have found your way to <i>The Harpers at Twilight</I>.  So, do you think you have what it takes to join this small but vigourous guild?  Does anyone ever know their true measure?  I am just a simple member of this fine guild, but if you ever see me in Hibernia, and express an interest, it is in my power to initiate you into our ranks as an apprentice.  Take care though.  The road you are about to travel is not an easy one.  You may want to look over the ideals we hold dear.  Once you read that, maybe you can find out a little more about us.<P></font>
<center><font size=+1><a href="http://www.xsorbit.com/users2/brightblades/index.cgi">The Harpers at Twilight Message Board!</a></font></center><P>
The Harpers at Twilight are a loose federation of misfits and heroes of all types who wish to defend the lands of Hibernia.  We have few hard and fast rules, and the requirements for membership are not what one would expect.  We do not require much of our members with a few exceptions:<P>
<UL><LI>Follow the "Code of the Harpers" as listed below.<BR>
<LI>Proudly carry the name of our guild and spread the word of our deeds.<BR>

<LI>Be active in the defense of our Realm.  It is our home and source of our power.<BR>
<LI>Kill <B>all</B> enemies, but be honorable.<BR>
<LI>Make every effort to steal our enemies relics for our own!  Glory to Hibernia!<br>
<LI>Be generous with your Harper Brother's and Sisters.  Pass down items and contribute to our vault as you can.<BR>
<LI>Make every effort to attend guild events, meetings, and raids.<p>
</UL>

<center>
<font size=+3><B>The Code of the Harpers</B></font></center><P>

<B>Harper Watchwords: (folloed by what it means in game terms)</B><BR>
<UL><LI>Harpers work against villainy and wickedness wherever they find it - but they work ever mindful of the consequences of what they do.<BR><I>
A member of the Harpers is expected to act towards defeating the Albions and Midgardians, but should use some common sense.  Don’t hinder a higher level RvR group by trying to tag along and dying every 5 seconds, spend time leveling first – then do your part to help against the other realms.  Remember spending time leveling and questing is just as important to defeating the other realms as fighting on the front lines is.</I>
<P>
<LI>All beings should walk free of fear, with the right to live their lives as they wish.<BR><I>
A member of the Harpers is expected to act with dignity at all times.  If you have a disagreement with another character, either keep it restricted to private sends or walk away.  Always remember that other players have the right to act as they choose so long as they abide by the rules of the game.  It is better to just walk away then to cause a huge flareup over a disagreement.</I>
<P>
<LI>One of the things so-called “civilized” folk do often is manipulate their fellows.  When a Harper seeks to sway others, it must always be done for good ends.<BR>
<LI>A Harper always tries to narrow the gap between good intentions and good results.<BR>
<LI>The subtle plan outstrips the bared blade.<BR>
<LI>The rule of law aids peace and fosters freedom, so long as the laws are just and those who enforce them lenient and understanding.<BR><I>
A member of the Harpers is expected to abide by the rules of the roleplaying server.  In particular, this means OOC (out of character) comments should be restricted to private sends or guild speech and should never be made over /say, /yell, or /broad.  On the reverse however, don’t jump on people who make a mistake.  A gentle reminder is often a far better deterrent to misbehavior than a scathing remark.</I><P>
<LI>No extreme is good.  For freedom to flourish, all must be in balance: the powers of realms, the reaches of the cities and the wilderlands into each other, and the influence of one being over another.<BR><I>
In game terms, this probably has the least bearing of any of the watchwords but I will say this much – no one player is more important than any other.  Just because a member is an officer does not give them the right to order others around.  There are exceptions, such as the battle commanders in RvR combat, but I do not want any players to think that because they are lower rank that their ideas are any less valid than another’s.</I>

<P>
<LI>Whatever it takes, a Harper will do.  Pride never rules the deeds of a true Harper.<BR><I>
In game terms, this is possibly the most important watchword to keep in mind.  Never consider it beneath yourself to stop and help another player in need.  If you are a resser, stop and res people that you come across – I know nothing makes me angrier than to see a druid walk past my corpse without stopping to res me.  If you are a craftsmen and someone comes into town asking for something, even if it’s below your level, volunteer your services – it gives our guild a good image and possibly even gains us a potential recruit.
</I>
<P>
<LI>Harpers can spare themselves less freedom than those the work to protect must have - but even a Harper must be free.<BR>
<I>
In game terms, a Harper is free to act as independently as he or she chooses.  I do not intend to set rules and call meetings regularly.  Each member is free to do what they want, so long as they do so in such a manner that does not reflect badly on the guild.</I>

<P>
<LI>Harpers police their own.  A Harper who hears the call of personal power can no longer hear the sweet song of the Harp.  A Harper who seizes power, and holds it above all else, is a traitor to the Harp.  Traitors must die, for freedom to live.<BR>
<I>
This is a warning that any member who continually fails to live up to the standards of the guild will be punished.  If a member fails to act honorably, or acts in such a manner that the guild is made to look bad, they will be suspended or expelled depending on the nature of the offense.
</I>
<P>
<LI>Without a past, no being can appreciate what they have, and where they may be going.<BR>
 
<I>
In game terms, members of the Harpers are expected to at least keep a passing knowledge of what is going on in the game.  It allows for much better roleplaying when someone can talk about how “they were there during such-and-such a battle” or how they met General Warr at the front lines.  This is probably one of the guidelines of least importance, but it can make the game a lot more fun for you and those around you by bringing Hibernia to life.
</I>
<P></ul>

<B>Harper Cares:</B><UL>
<LI>Harpers who have Harper pins carry them unless going into situations where the discovery of their identity would endanger their mission.  Harpers wear their pins openly only as a recognition signal to other Harpers, or at Harper gatherings.<BR><I>
Members of the Harpers who have received their guild emblem are expected to wear the emblem whenever not in a situation that requires otherwise.  If your best magic cloak doesn’t have an emblem and you need to wear it for combat that is fine, but if you are running around town you should be displaying your emblem.
</I>
<P>
<LI>Harpers don’t give up; they always work on unfinished missions, however much time has passed.<BR>
<LI>Harpers help other Harpers without hesitation or thought of personal cost or credit.<BR><I>
If another Harper is in need, members of the Harpers are expected to render assistance if they are able.  Do not charge substantial markups on crafted goods to members of the guild, and be willing to take a few minutes to help someone else out if at all possible.  If you are out hunting and someone needs help half an hour away you are not expected to just drop everything and go, but if the request is reasonable do everything you can to help each other out.
</I>
<P>
<LI>Harpers do not conceal their own shortcomings or handicaps from other Harpers.<BR>
<LI>Harpers never stop listening and looking, no matter how tired, hurt, or affected by magic or wine.  An awake Harper never relaxes.<BR>
<LI>Harpers do not respect rank or power; Harpers do respect wisdom and good character.  Harpers never discriminate on the basis of sex or race - but almost always take careful note of a being’s religion and how loyal that being is to it.  Strong religious belief can be a dangerous thing; if the deity’s nature or commandments stand opposed to the Harpers.<BR>
<LI>Harpers do the unexpected.</UL><P>

<B>General Harper Reactions:</B><BR>
<UL><LI> In general Harpers work against anyone or anything that grows to strong and ambitious to maintain a balance with neighboring lands, folk, and business.  They aid the weak and oppressed, and they try to free slaves whenever this is prudent and practical.<BR>
<LI>Harpers may sing and joke, but they tend to say little of their true feelings and thoughts.  Someone they suspect of being a foe or an individual they’re soon going to have to deal with will rarely sense their scrutiny or hostility.</UL><P>

<I>The Harpers at Twilight</I> are a very small group of roleplayers on the Guinevere Server in The Dark Age of Camelot, in the Hibernia realm.  We are always looking for new members, so please look us up and let us know.  Currently this is the only web page out there that talks about the guild, but I am trying to get more information out there so we can become better known.  Right now we are mostly folks in the level ranges of 12 to 25.  We actively roleplay, get involved in RvR, and in general support each other in any way we can.<P>
Many of you may be familiar with the Harpers of Forgotten Realms fame.  This is basically what we are trying to emulate.  <P>
