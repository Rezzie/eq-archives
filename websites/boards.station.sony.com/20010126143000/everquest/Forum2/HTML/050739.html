</FONT><HR>All right, due to the impression that you all have given me, it seems that I need to cover wizards next…<P>I’ve already made several notes to myself about wizards, and I may as well start out this discussion with those notes.  Keep in mind that these ‘talks’ are geared toward making sure that the classes are ‘balanced’.  Please work toward that goal when posting (yes, even if that means you suggest a ‘nerf’).  But I’m also interested in hearing about bugs and such too, I’m just not going to focus on them.<P>Here are the notes that I already have.  Keep in mind that these are only my notes, and just because I’ve listed something does NOT mean that I like the idea or that the designers are working on making changes based on these notes.  This is just what it is, a list of ideas.  I’ve also added my notes to you all under the header of Note:<P>AoE spells:  Mentioned elsewhere…  (earlier on my list, probably under mages:  basically the idea here is that maybe pets should be removed from the equation).<P>Gaze/Glimpse:  Due to the clipping plane, these spells don’t really allow further seeing, just zooming in (which makes your resolution worse anyhow).<P>Note:  this may not be ‘fixable’ at all due to the way the game works.  It’s not like we can force your PC into a higher resolution when you use this spell…<P>Fade/Shadowstep/Yonder:  There seems to be a problem with these spells.  Since they will not teleport you up, they don’t work too well in hilly terrain; because the spell only sends you a few feet (stopping when it reaches a hill or building).<P>Note:  Again, this may also not be something we can change, but it’s on the list.<P>Bind Sight:  Seems to cause viewer to see the target as running into walls or spinning in circles if target goes up an incline.<P>Enstill:  It seems that this spell is not a more useful or more powerful root, it’s just more expensive. <P>Cazic Gate:  At level spell is attained, using it will most often cause death because the caster appears amidst many aggressive monsters that /con white to them.<P>Note:  We’ve actually discussed this before.  If I remember correctly, the general feeling was that having a dangerous gate like this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.  But it is also still on my list.<P>Tishan’s Relocation:  This spell evacuates you to a very dangerous location, a monster crossroads in the Skyfire mountains.  Could the location be moved, or was it intended that this be a very dangerous evacuation spell?<P>Note:  See note about Cazic Gate.<P>Concussion:  A level 39 spell dropped by a creature in a location that requires a party of level 50s to handle.  Should it be in such a location?<P>Icestrike effects:  Graphical effect looks like fire.<P>Lightning Bolt effects:  looks exactly like Fire Bolt.<P>Other lightning and cold effects:  It seems that there might be other spells that have the look of fire when they should not.<BR> <BR>Having just re-read this list, I see nothing at all related to actual balancing stuff.  This is all nit-picky stuff about minor effects and bugs and such (with the possible exception of Area of Effect spells, changing those would certainly have an effect on class balances).  So, please, try to focus on balance issues…<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I can NOT believe you ignored the biggest wizard complaint of the past few months with is the CAZIC SKIN!<P>I don't play a wizard, i'm a level 60 warrior, but here are my suggestions:<P>1. Increase drop rate of Cazic Skin. It is currently sad and pathetic.<P>2. new portals to Everfrost, OoT, move WK portal to the QH zone, remove Kunark Dungeon requirement from Tishan and Markar's Relocation.<P>3. No Magic DD at level 60, wizards get Ice Spear of Solist for Cold and Sunstrike for fire but no Magic based DD at 60, please look into this.<P>4. Manaless damage, shamans are the best nuker in the game because of Jaundiced Bone Bracer, I'd recommend giving wizards a relatively easy item to obtain like the JBB that does more damage, best spell IMO for this would be Ice Shock (level 34 dd).<P>5. PoG Robe, the casting time is WAY too long to be useful, please reduce it to 2x the casting time like the JBB is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well fixing AE spells would certainly open up another can of worms.. making kiting several mobs even easier. BUT.. it should be done. Right now the entire line is useless, which isn't how spells should be. So modify that to remove the pet aspect, then perhaps make it like complete heal is for clerics.. super ratio, but 10 sec casting time?<P><BR>Wyrd</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not a wizard myself, but here is my take on them:<P>Regular EQ: OK Balance, a bit under powered do to lack of lures and lower dmg/mana ratio.<P>RoK: Very useful for large encounters, top level mobs don't have a lot more hit points then in regular EQ but wizards can pump out alot more damage.<P>Velious: Wizards are practically useless except for that relocate spell.  When a wizards empties a full load of mana on a mob (say Dain for example) and doesn't see the mob's hit points move something is wrong.<P>Wizards went from balanced in Regular EQ to over powered in Kunark (only on boss mobs) to useless in SoV.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>problem: wizard's power post 50.<P>They don't do much more damage when other class power went through the roof.  This is aggreviated by much more fizzles than before, not just on specific spells (like Ato's Spectral Shackles) but  why do i fizzles much more on a level 4 spell like see invis at level 58 that when i was at level 50?<P>It's a percentage problem, wizard damage output in a group (and more so in a multi-groups raid) is less and less compared to what it was pre-50.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hail friends,<P>Being a wizard, and playing on PvP server, in group situation, ALL AE spells are useless, and real danger to group. I simply can not use them. PLEASE consider adjusting them on PvP servers so they at least to not damage group members (the situation intended on blue servers). Why are we denied the ability to damage multiple mobs without actually killing our group?  AE spells are part of "balance equation" on other servers, and on PvP this just has been dropped and never fixed.<P>Second concern is casting after running. Most of the time I have to stop, wait 2 seconds before casting a spell, or it will be interrupted. I am sure it could be fixed, e.g. put a programming check on the client, whether player is running when starting a cast, and send this info to server along with casted spell info.<P>Belia Deathbind<BR>Wizard<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kunark Evacuates should no longer require one casting from within an officially licensed Kunark Dungeon. (same for druid evacs). This just makes the  whole game better for everyone.<P><BR>Rain spells like you mentioned should not hit pets. Also, they have been made excessively resistable. Once again, please stop pets from taking away the spell's pulses and make them resisted at a reasonable rate.

DRASTIC reduction in casting time (near-instant), bigger radius, reduced taunt, lower resist and insta-recast. Basically, turn this line into the AE 'mana dump' line that was intended.<P>Ports-<P>If teleportation is supposed to be our 'class defining' ability, why do Druids get more ports in better locations and earlier than Wizards?

</FONT><HR>My only reply is that when you think of balance you have to think of all the hits that a wizard (and many of the int casters)takes to hit points and allowable AC.  A wizard is a very fragile creature in general, what do they gain to be balanced because of their loss?  Do they do more damage in combat because they can't last as long?  I think the issues related to the things taken away from a wizard right off the platform (AC and hps) should be considered heavily in what the 'balanced' damage output and utility should be from such a class.  Since wizards are only porting and damage machines their role is even easier to see clearly.  They are to do damage.<BR>I just want to see the question asked and answered:<BR>"Do wizards have offensive powers that overcome their hit point disadvantage?

</FONT><HR>I think the biggest problem wizards have is the damage/mana ratio per level.  No class (NONE) should ever be within 20% the ratio of a wizard of the same level in general damage spells (DD and *hehe* rain spells).  The level that another class gets a anti-undead or anti-summoned spell can come closer, but at the next rank spells, the gap widens again.<P>As an aside, I feel that Clerics should share in Harvest casting.<P>Two simple solutions to start wizard balancing:<BR>1a.  Decrease the mana cost of damage spells 24th and below by 10%<BR>1b.  Double the effectiveness of Specialize:Evocation for wizards.<P>2.   As the master seekers of knowledge (and planar cab), allow Wizards to take a second specialize.   Make it Alteration, so our ports are more efficient.<P>I do not want DoTs.  <BR>I do not want pets.  <BR>I do not want to cast Clarity:self or SoW:self.<BR>I want to make things die.<BR>I do not want things that give me XP to die in one hit.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This breaks the cleric/warrior combo and allows wizards (who have all types of damage spells, fire/cold/magic) and other casters to feel needed in encounters.<P>Also, create some type of spell that adds to the group, not just a straight damage spell.  What I mean is group dynamics.  Wizards play the same in or out of groups, give them a buff (small or large) that is similair to the mages damage shield.  Give them something to make them feel like part of the group instead of standing on the sideline and nuking when the mob is at half damage...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Enstill: It seems that this spell is not a more useful or more powerful root, it’s just more expensive."<P>I use Enstill far more as a shaman, because my higher AC allows for me to channel it better when I'm getting pounded... but, though it is disparaged sometimes, I think it's useful as is.  I believe the long hold time is very useful for crowd control.<P>My primary complaint with the wizard class is, though they are (in my opinion) a very underrated class, they could stand to do more damage in a group, given Velious mob hit points, and the fact that all other casting classes have some way to do damage other than with their mana pool (through a pet or buffs on melee classes).  The obvious problem: How can a wizard be a more effective group member, without throwing their soloability out of line?  (Well, and without giving them more power to kill-steal whatever they want.)<P>I've heard two ideas that I liked for making a wizard a more desireable party member, without overpowering them for soloing:<P>1) Specialization changes: I was thinking it would be neat if wizards, being such a singularly focused class, could receive a sort of second Specialization:Evocation skill.  Perhaps they would be twice as likely to specialize in general, and would once in a while "double specialize," reducing mana cost for a blast twice.  <P>My thought is that this kind of skill would allow a wizard to watch his/her mana bar and note, "Ah, I double spec'd on that blast--I can afford another," but wouldn't be something the wizard could count on happening regularly enough to be a reliable solo boost.<P>2) "Reflection" Spells: One suggested spell line was a mana efficient, large blast, in the form of a spell one would cast on a party member to give them a sizeable, one-use proc on their next hit.  Seeing as the spell would come from a tank, the wizard could cast it early without aggro problems (perhaps it should have a long refresh, so it would be the "first strike", and the wizard would need to rely on standard spells for a finishing blow).  Obviously, it wouldn't be a spell that one could use to kill-steal, and it would clearly need a target level limit to avoid powerleveling.<P>Those are just my two "weird ideas"--I'll leave further detailed discussion on numbers, mana-efficiency, and so forth to the more experienced.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Simply make the Kunark Evacs for druids and wizards castable from any location.  Or from any dungeon, if there has to be a restriction, for some reason.  But with these gates to EJ and Skyfire, the three corners of Kunark should be covered.<P>Which still leaves the question of wizard/druid gates in Q Hills/SFG, OOT and other old world locations....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Alan<BR>Thanks for moving Wizards up the list. I really love EQ and am totally addicted! A wizard is my main but I'm starting to put a lot of time into other characters lately. <P>My own personal issue on balance:<P>The other day while fighting in Kunark, my group pulled in a mob that was probably 10 levels higher than us (low 30s). We had a well rounded group warrior, rogue, cleric, mage, druid, and me.  It was very frustrating for me because everyclass contributed to the fight in some way except me!! I did not feel balanced. The melee's attacked it with their weapons (of course they didn't hit very often, but they hit!), the cleric healed, the mage damage shielded and the pet hit the mob, the druid healed and buffed...and I could do nothing. I could not land a spell (all resisted!), I can't buff or damage shield, I can't heal, I can't do anything...In my opinion the lures should be available at lower levels (20+) so that wizards can have *something* to contribute in such a fight (the damage in such a fight would probably be substantially less than a melee would do, but it would be something!). Every class should be able to help. All other caster classes have either buffs or pets to help attack such a monster. <P>I also play on a pvp team server and would love to be able to use AoE spells even when I chose to group with someone not elven.<P>Some of the levels (pre-50) need adjustments in terms of dd spells compared to magicians. The bolt spells they get should not come anywhere close in damage to a wizards (because they have a pet and we don't). I will leave this to people more knowledgeable on the specifics, but I think a mana efficiency adjustment is necessary.<P>Oh, and please please please move the WK port site, or at least answer us on the logic of why it is placed where it is (so close to the NK port and so far from QH zone).<P>Anyway, for balancing I will post the polite thread opening, as it is a very nice summary:<P>Al'Kabor spells. Al'Kabor, the (supposedly) most powerful wizard in existence, who has an entire line of spells named after him... what an absolute embarassment. I know of NO wizard who can keep a straight face while actually discussing these spells. I even see them being auctioned in Freeport by other classes as "(Whatever) of Al'Crapor," the pet name most of wizzies have for the spell line. The mana to damage ratio on these spells is, for lack of a better word, a complete joke. Let's compare:<P>Level 51 - Pillar of Frost<BR>750damage or so to 4 targets, 325 mana, 10ft radius of effect<P>Level 51 - Something of Al'Kabor<BR>720 damage or so to 5 targets, 650 mana, 35ft radius of effect<P>Twice the mana for the same damage (with an extra target), and a slightly increased radius of effect is NOT worth it under any circumstances whatsoever. Period. For over a year now I've searched for a way to use these spells effectively without success. At lower levels, the discrepancy in damage/mana compared to spells of the same level is even *more* exaggerated - to the point it's laughable. I've been in hunting groups in Seb, etc, which simply *destroy* the Ak'Kabor spells looted without even *asking* if anyone wants them, because they're notoriously useless.<P>2. Enstill. We're given this spell at level 20, and then given the news that our level 4 root is now no longer going to hold critters as it has before. (At level 20, the effectiveness of root is *severely* reduced. It's sudden, not gradual. It's definitely a "message" from the gods to anyone trying to use it, that it's time to do something different.) This is apparently to encourage us to use the new Root-based spell.<P>However, Enstill is almost as much of a joke as the Al'Kabor line. At level 20, against a level 20 mob, it is easily resisted 19/20 times. When it *does* stick, if a fly so much as breathes the wrong way on the mob, it breaks. If a spell cannot take effect 90% of the time (and I know the propensity on this board to exaggerate percentages and stats - this is not an exaggeration), and then is completely ineffective the other 10%, it's useless to us. It simply isn't worth the research time invested.<P>3. Gates. Most are great. One is embarassing and two are deathtraps. When we are given the Skyfire and Cazic gates, gating into either location is instant suicide for a wiz of that level. The Cazic gate aggros immediately (this was supposedly fixed to not happen any longer, but it still does), killing any young wiz who appears before they can react. The Skyfire evac is similar. The Tishan's and Markar's Relocation line (the Kunark evacs) are an evac line - they cost the same mana as an evac, have the same effect as an evac (chance to leave someone behind), and the same casting time. WHY is one of them designed to require vast amounts of preparation, buffing, and strategy before it's safe to zone in there? The evac point for Tishan's is *literally* in the *middle* of one of the most heavily-NPC-trafficed, high-level areas of Skyfire, right by the Veeshan's Peak orb. There's no reason to "evacuate" a group to their deaths.<P>Also, the West Karana and North Karana wizard spires are sort of amusing. They are located on opposite sides of a zone line, 30 seconds' run from one another. In the entire zone of West Karanas, one of the biggest, emptiest zones in the game, why oh why is our wizard platform as far east, towards the NK spire, as it can be? Why have that platform at all?<P>One of the reasons that Qeynos is so underused by the average population, is that there is no druid/wizard drop point nearby. Freeport has the WC ring/spire. Qeynos has no druid ring, and a wiz spire which takes a full 15 minutes' run to reach at SoW speed. Moving the useless WK wiz spire closer to Qeynos Hills would do wonders for Qeynos' popularity as a city, not to mention Halas, Everfrost, Blackburrow, and Permafrost.<P>The WC-to-Freeport run takes 5 minutes. The WK-to-Qeynos run can easily take 15. With all of the (obvious) development time put into Qeynos (it's the quest capital of the world, and one of the most complex and detailed cities) I would assume the dev team would be looking for ways to make it a bit more frequented.<P>---------<P>Now, on to some more general issues. (Not quite done yet, please bear with me.)<P>The Draught Lines and Pillar lines post-50 are a godsend. Thank you thank you thank you. Draught is unbelievably fast, mana efficient, and useful. The Pillar line is amazing as well.<P>Lure used to be the crowning achievement of our class. The spell that got us invited on raids. (Being invited to only do *transport* for a raid doesn't count - that's just insulting.) They were supposedly changed so that the "type" of lure would determine resist chance. If this is working as intended, that's great. Unfortunately it isn't. Any mob of higher level than the caster is getting a high chance of resisting lure, regardless of the type, at the moment. Similar to any other spell we can throw. At nearly twice the mana as comparable nukes of the same level, this makes Lures rather useless. Please oh please fix this bug. The news that Lure no longer works well has spread like wildfire across EQ. Many uberguilds, if you look at their websites, have stopped recruiting any more wizards. That's a fairly effective way of determining the class's desire post-50.<P>It's been mentioned before by GZ that giving us O'Keil's Radiation (the 2dmg fire shield) at level 4 was a mistake left over from beta. Why then cement the mistake at level 30-something by giving us an equally useless spell, O'Keil's Flickering Flame, in Velious? A 5dmg fire shield at level 30-whatever is pretty amusing. I'm not sure why it was given to us. Some sort of more useful, personal buff instead would be much more in-line with the rest of our spells. Was this a mistake? A joke? It's a good one, if the latter. I can always get a good chuckle out of groups by casting it.<P>Atol's Spectral Shackles. Great spell... when it goes off. I'm not sure if it's intended or not, but at level 55 (it's a 51 spell) with a maxed Alteration skill, the spell still has the propensity to fizzle 4-5 times before going off. The problem is, it tends to "chain fizzle." Waiting 10 seconds after a fizzle is almost guaranteed to work, whereas trying to cast immediately after a fizzle is almost guaranteed to have it fizzle 5-6 times. Is this intended? Is this spell *supposed* to fizzle so incredibly often? I know many many wizards who refuse to use the spell, instead relying on the level 29 Bonds of Force, instead, just for this reason.<P>Harvest. It's a great spell. Very class-defining. I love it, other classes are envious. Well... until the high levels. Harvest from when you get it (level 34 I believe) up to around level 48-50 is great. It's scaled to give slightly more mana each level so you get the same "percent" of mana back (roughly 3/4's to a full bubble of mana) regardless of your level. However, it apparently was never scaled past that point when Kunark came out. After 50 it gives less and less. At 55, my Harvest gives me a quarter bubble of mana, if that. At 10 minutes a cast, that's less effective than the 1-mana-point-a-tick Manaskin. I've had relatively the same gear since 34, so my mana pool hasn't artificially inflated at all. I know of many wizards who bid a fair farewell to this spell in their lineup at level 45 or so.<P>To wrap up, an overall class complaint. Pre-Kunark, wizards were very well balanced. Post-Kunark, as far as Kunark material was concerned (levels 50-60, the higher mobs like Trak, etc), our effectiveness was reduced relative to other classes quite a bit. Melee types were given better gear. They could last in fights longer. Many classes were given special armor (Cobalt, Donals, Singing Steel, etc). Wizzies got, well, basically nothing. There were a lot of class-specific stuff added, but nothing class-specific for wizzies. All of our items were in the broader, "caster" class. This isn't a wiz only complaint -- many caster classes felt left out as well.<P>In Velious, the problem isn't the phat lewt. The problem is, the hitpoint cap on uber-mobs has gone through the roof. When you have a class who's sole purpose for existence is dealing a HUGE amount of damage, fast, to kill something before it annihilates the out-of-mana wizzie, this is a problem. A full tank of mana, our only source of damage, doesn't even NICK a Velious uber mob. Once our mana is gone - that's it. We have no pets, no melee ability, we can't heal, buff, etc. We can nuke for a sliver of damage, then we're through. Out of commision. Meanwhile the tanks keep on tanking, the rogues keep on ripping through the baddies with their Ragebringers, (incidentally dealing nearly as much damage a second as a wizzie can deal chain-nuking)...<P>Wizzies, on these raids, end up doing the least amount of total damage to the mob than any other damage-dealing class there. The *anti-thesis* of what our class supposedly should be about.<P>And last, but not least, our epic item. A count was done on Graffe's Wizard Forum (the most popular wiz class site on the web), pooling everyone's knowledge about how many wiz uber weapons are inexistence across the servers. We arrived at the number "13." Across every server. The ONLY reason for this insanely low number is ONE item - Cazic Skin.<P>Where other classes' uber weapons require huge packs of friends, planning, skill, and epic battles, ours revolved around one item which requires nothing but mind numbing tedium. To place an item on a 1-week spawn mob, which is ALREADY camped and killed within hours of his spawning even *without* the epic weapon taken into consideration, is silly. To make the item drop chance on him so low that only 13 have dropped in all of EQ is ridiculous. (Nevermind the question, why does Cazic only have his skin 1% of the time anyway?) I can think of few other uber weapon decisions so poor, except for perhaps the Mage's reliance on Quillmane in SK.<P>This isn't a question of "skill" or "time invested." It's a question of luck and frustration invested. That's simply not fun. I know not everyone can have an uber item. I would gladly give up the chance of ever personally getting one to have this fixed. But please, please, please... please have this epic weapon rely on something other than luck, months of camping, and strong-arming other Fear guilds out of the way. It does nothing but create grief for everyone who ever wants to hunt in Fear. And an item which does nothing but introduce grief and hatred into the game isn't worth it. Introducing an item into the game which does nothing but piss off thousands of people (most of whom aren't wizzies), with almost no benefit to the server in general, is pointless. Ragebringers, Chanter sticks, Water Sprinklers - they're all wonderful ways to invest your time, for the individual as well as the guild helping. The reward is great, and it's a way of encouraging cooperation and teamwork. The wizzie weapon requires strong-arming hundreds of players out of Fear, and upsetting a large number of people. It doesn't encourage teamwork. It doesn't require any skill. It doesn't encourage cooperation. In its current state, it just encourages emnity and hatred.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here is my partial list of wizard concerns: (I play on a "blue server")<P>1) Wizard Velious portal spells not on vendor when druids have a vendor that sells ALL their Velious portals in the most blatantly obvious place to find them.<P>2) AoE spells under 51 are horrible damage-to-mana ratio.<P>3) Staff of Temperate Flux should lower magic resist as well as fire and cold.  If not, then at least change the Weeping Wand to have an effect like the Staff of Temperate Flux, but lowering magic resist.  Basically, we need a way to lower magic resist for ourselves.  Also, if these spells do not stack with malaise/tashania, then they should.<P>4) PvP resists.  I don't care what you do to the "red" servers, but I really think you should turn our spells back to 100% in DUELS as well as reducing the impact of resists.  It's annoying when I try to duel a melee character one level below me who has 140+ resists, and I can't even root or anything.  In duels, we are sometimes reduced to cheesy tactics like shadowstepping or running up on objects to get a chance to cast. (Yeah, I probably suck at PvP, but I dont't care)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>5) Wizard teleport locations.  We need to have the teleport spot in West Karana moved closer to Qeynos Hills or we need a teleport spot set up in Everfrost.  I would also like to see the "Kunark-dungeon-only" restrictions lifted from Markar's and Tishan's Relocations.  If you want, you can add another silly "tooth" at the port location.  Also, move the port location in Skyfire.<P>6) Mana regeneration after 50.  We need a change to meditate much like the changes to harm-touch and lay-on-hands.  With the meditate cap of 252, after 50 our mana regeneration is ridiculously slow.  It should be changed to +5% per level after 50 when you max it out.  Basically, at level 4 you have a max of 25, while you would have 305 at 60.  You are capped at 252 when you reach 50, so you should scale our regen up from 51 to 60 to compensate.<P>7) Manaskin regen should be upped by 2 or 3 points per tick so that it is more useful (wish).  <BR>8) Harvest should either have a lower recast delay, regen more mana, and/or be made into a "skill" instead of a spell.<P>9) I know you said it's "nit-picky", but all our "lightning" spells (AoE included) should use the "lightning-graphic" like Rend and Lightning Shock use.<P>10) Make the Al'kabor spells useful by increasing the damage-to-mana ratio.<P>11) Make Paralyzing Earth/Immobilize/Enstill more useful by making each less resistable than root ending with Paralyzing Earth being almost like a lure.  This would also help address issue number 4  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>12) Give us more quests.  We need more ways to increase our faction with Qeynos wizard guild specifically.  I would like to see the guildmasters at ALL wizard guilds give some nice big "fun" quest that could result in a nice reward, but does not have to.  It could be a multi-part quest where you get faction for every step along the way.  We need more to do at all levels for "fun".<P>13) Make sure the lures are almost completely unresistable on all encounters.  I mean make sure that for EVERY critter in the entire game we should be able to do some damage with one of our lures.<P>14) Give us familiars.  I'm not saying this is a requirement, but didn't Mickey's sorceror have spells for familiars (brooms anyone?).  I don't care if the things are even dumber than enchanter pets and are 1/3 as powerful, but ANYTHING would be helpful.  (Ok, so don't give us pets.  I had to ask though)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>15) We need self-gates to all the places we can teleport to.  How is it that we can take other people to South Ro, Dreadlands, Great Divide, Wakening Land, and Cobalt Scar, but cannot just gate ourselves?  (Ok, so this is a bit nit-picky, but so what?)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>16) more to come when I have more time to think.<P>I also don't want this at the bottom of a 300-post thread where it won't be seen  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello gang<P>Here are my thoughts<P>1.  Risk vs Rewards.. got no pets to hide behind and generally do equal damage or less if you count pets than necro and mage.  Yet no pet to hide behind.. we are the masters of dd.. no.. we are the masters of risk.. without reward.<P>2.  We need more mana than other caster classes.. hands down.. we dont have pets to hide behind.. yet our gastanks are the same size.. why?  In Velious.. well yeah you have read the above posts.. we are little cheerleaders in robes.. cant do jack really.<P>3.  Harvest needs to be more useful.  As it stands.. it gives a small ammount of mana.. SMALL being the key word.. wizards need more mana.. as its all we do.. is nuke and such.. <P>4.  Cazic Skin needs to drop more<P>5.  Would be nice to have like.. REAL part buffs.. why must we only have self buffs.<P>6.  BIG ONE.  If mages get their focus item quests.. brooms mugs torch shovel.. why not give wizards some focus crystal quests.. just possessing them makes your spells do % more damage and cost % less mana.. make the quests not post 50 like everything else you say our class is balanced with.. as getting to 50 is not for all..  make them start at 30 or so.  Maybe make the crystals +int and saves too.. who knows.. perhaps make the base crystal just a minimal % boost.. and then more quests to UPGRADE them thru the levels and game.. thus being bigger and cooler..  We want amplifyers<P>7.  Give us more port locations.. we are masters of teleportation.. yet druids get the same shpeel.. Make druids more group friendly.. and make us a little more port friendly.. I dunno<P>8.  Make Bonds of Force last a lil longer?<P><BR>We really need to address the fact a mage can outdamge us.. and your only saving grace is that we can hit ubers.. POST 50.. thus before 50 you are a mage without a pet.  And thats just stupid.<P>Thanks<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 12 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050739&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050739&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
