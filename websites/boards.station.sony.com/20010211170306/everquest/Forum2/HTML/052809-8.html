&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>On the issue of CLASS BALANCE<P>There has been much talk lately concerning class balance.  I am not going to tell you that the class I play (warrior) should be made more powerful than every other class.   Nor am I going to tell you that other classes should be made weaker to balance them out.  I give you a lot of credit for attempting to satisfy the masses without ruining a great game.  However, there are some issues that need to be addressed.<BR>	I play on Rallos Zek, which as you know, is pure PvP.  I have been reading the news postings and updates that have recently gone live with the latest patch as of 1/9/01.  Many of the issues in the update deal with class balance- most specifically, hybrids.  By reading the comments/ changes that have been implemented as of yet, I think Verant has done a great job in terms of dealing with balance issues on NON-PvP servers.<BR>	What Verant must understand is that a purely PvP environment requires some additional consideration.  I will explain.  On a NON-PvP server, classes are considered “balanced” if everyone in the group has a comparable contribution to the group.  This means that every class has their specific job to do. (not just damage)<BR>	On a PvP server, however, classes are only balanced if there is no “sure thing” when characters of differing classes fight each other.  By this I mean that there is no balance in a game where a Necromancer will ALWAYS beat a Wizard of the same level.  Therefore, each class must have its own ability not only to defend its self, but also to inflict damage.   Which is why hybrids have received the latest enhancements.<P>HOW CLASSES COMPARE IN PvP SETTINGS<BR> (Classes are ranked from best PvP class to worst) <P>1) Bard-they can’t kill others fast, but they are good due to high mobility, charm, regen, and resists.  The only reason they can sometimes beat a pet class is because they could at one point charm them against the owner. Can simply kite pure melee characters to death, given the room to do so.<BR>2) Necromancer- has a pet for distraction/ spell interrupt, MASSIVE damage at higher levels, and their primary spells are poison and disease which most players don’t have high resists in.  They also have nearly unresistable lifetaps and dots (splurt).  They can simply cast Shadowstep to get away from melee chars while DOTS and pet kill the melee char. Can simply kite pure melee characters to death.<BR>3) Shaman- Has high mobility with SOW, and has a weak pet for distraction/ spell interrupt, and SOME damage, and their primary spells are poison and disease which most players don’t have high resists in.  They have regen, and heal to use in combat, and can cure ALL dots.  They can also boost their resistances quite high. Can simply kite pure melee characters to death.<BR>4) Druid-  Has high mobility, good direct damage spells ( 2nd best in the game behind wizard) good resistance buffs like the shaman, and nearly unresistable DOTS (swarm line of spells) Can simply kite pure melee characters to death.<BR>5) Mage- Direct damage spells almost as good as a wizard/druid, but their real power lies in the pet.  The pet can inflict 2-3 times that which certain melee classes are capable of.  And versus all pure melee classes, there is nothing they can do to avoid being subjected to this damage besides zone out.  The mage simply kites the pure melee class till they are dead.  If the pure melee tries to fight the pet, even if its blue con, the pet will most likely kill them in straight on melee.  Not only that, but if the pet has a damage shield…its even worse.  Casters against mages will most likely just root the pet and go for the mage.<BR>6) Wizard-this class makes the best “gankers”.  This means that they wait for a character to pull a mob, then attack the player while they are busy with a mob.  They have the best direct damage spells in the game, but can be highly resisted with the right gear.<BR>7) Enchanter-decent damage on DOTS, and direct damage spells, but if opponent has high magic resist, there is NOTHING enchanters can do against an opponent.<BR>8) Shadow knight- Good melee skills, almost unresistable lifetaps, low resist DOTS (poison/ disease) and Harmtouch, which can do a sizeable amount of damage (970 damage at level 60)<BR>9) Ranger- Good mobility with sow, they can heal, they have all the melee skills of the warrior, good melee buffs, nearly unresistable dots (swarm line) some direct damage spells, and a damage shield that could spell disaster for melee classes that use low delay weapons.  They can simply kite pure melee classes to near death, and then finish them off with melee/ damage shield.<BR>10) Paladin- Good melee ability, can blind, stun, cast minor damage, heal, and most importantly, Lay on hands.  While warriors are supposed to have the most hitpoints of any class, this is not true.  A paladin with LoH has more by far.  Especially when you consider that they get superior heal.<BR>11) Monk- the best of the pure melee’s in duel because they can inflict massive damage with regular melee as well as kicks in the 100’s.  They also get some of the best damage/delay/ effect weapons in the game.  They also get mend, which can be a great help when dueling.<BR>12) Rogue- they can take advantage of poisons.  Some high level poisons can inflict serious damage as well as debuffs.  They can also backstab for serious damage.<BR>13) Warrior-Even with massive a hitpoint base, warriors can be defeated by all pure melee classes, and every single caster class except cleric, and maybe enchanter if the warrior has high magic resist.  Virtually helpless against any class that has a higher base mobility then they do, warriors are especially at the mercy of pet classes, whose pets can kill them 1 on 1, even without the help of the caster.<BR>14) Cleric- While tuff to kill due to resistances and their ability to heal most damage inflicted to them, they will RARELY ever defeat an opponent by killing them.  They simply don’t have the spells to do enough damage.  Most, if not all of their damage spells are magic based, which tend to be highly resisted.  Most casters will simply run out of mana before the cleric dies.  Melee classes could win against a cleric, but it would take a long time if the cleric was able to cast heals.<P>* As you noticed, mobility is often the deciding factor in the fate of pure melee characters. (Monk, warrior, rogue) While the high level disciplines surely help when dueling other melee classes, they do NOTHING to help them against caster classes. <P>SOME SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE PvP (changes ONLY the way PvP works)<P>&#61623; Give normal resist rates to “unresistable” spells only to player characters-much like the patch that made direct damage spells do 2/3 of the damage to player characters.  Melee classes only defense against spell casters is resistance gear, and that gear does nothing to prevent us from taking A LOT of damage because the spell is nearly unresistable.  Examples: lures, splurt, winged death, Harm touch, life taps.<BR>&#61623; Add disciplines to melee chars such as:<BR>&#61623; REFLECTION-bounces back a % of the spell damage to the caster.<BR>&#61623; SUMMONING-much like level 50+ melee npc’s (ice giants) can summon players to their side. (“you will not evade me”)<BR>&#61623; IMMUNE-gives short duration (~10 seconds) of immunity to all types of spells.  Long reuse time.<BR>&#61623; Make critical hits occur MUCH more often, and crippling blows occur at 60% health rather than at 40%.  The amount of time it takes to go from 40% health to death is too short a time to have a decent change at scoring a crippling blow.  I am level 45, and have only scored 2 crippling blows in my entire career.  And neither time did they turn the balance of power in the fight.  Make them more useful.  Also, what is the point of scoring a critical hit for less damage than the max normal damage of the weapon without a critical hit? (If I can make a regular hit for 97, why would a critical hit of 64 be useful?)<BR>&#61623; Make a crippling blow do just that- cripple a target.  For example, a crippling blow would result in a condition similar to “Snare”, or “Disempower”. ( lower armor class, agility, strength, etc)  The way they stand now, crippling blows are so infrequent, that it would not be overpowering to enhance them.<BR>&#61623; Make a critical hit stun the target for a short time.<BR>&#61623; Give more melee classes the ability to mend, or a variation of it. (less healing power than monks get, etc)<BR>&#61623; Increase the damage causing abilities of clerics in PvP situations.  The way they are now, they usually don’t have enough resources to kill another player.  All their damage spells are magic based, and therefore are resisted a lot. Increase damage output on existing spells for PvP only.  Or remove the 2/3 cap on PvP damage for clerics. Add some variety in the types of damage spells clerics and enchanters can cast (poison, disease, etc)<BR>&#61623; Increase the attack speed, and damage on range attacks in PvP ONLY.  Give them double attack and reasonable delays, as well as a spell interrupt component.  Maybe increase the range to be comparable to that of shock type spells.<P>I think you understand the gist of what I’m saying.  What could a pure melee class do to win a duel against a class with higher mobility and the capability to inflict damage from afar? Answer: Nothing.  They WILL LOSE.  This is NOT a balance of the classes.<BR>The only options are to zone, or die.  And death has a stiff penalty on Rallos Zek if you have expensive gear.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, here's my two cents. Of course, I'm only level 52 so perhaps some things get scewed out of proportion.<P>First, I think there are a lot of misconceptions about warriors and how good they are. First, we do not have that many more hitpoint compared to shadow knights and paladins. When fully buffed by a cleric, I say we have between 5-10% more hitpoints.<P>Second, there is a misconception that every warrior is level 60, has full cobalt/indi gear and weapons that make the epic quest item suck. I find that the Indi/Cobalt gear is so difficult to acquire compared to other classes that we often have far less AC then other tanks.<P>The question I really am asking Absor is if you are balancing the class in regards to uber-guilded players who have all the cool gear, go to the planes every weekend, and have a hard time deciding whether to use their epic quest weapon over the willsapper/scimmy of lifestealing.<P>Because most of us 50+ people will never get the epic quest item. Most of us won't have full indi or cobalt gear. On my server, the majority of players don't even have a piece of indi and the only two cobalt pieces you see with regularity are boots and guantlets.<P>It's a tough question Absor, because when the warrior has everything they are quite capable and in some instances overshadow hybrids completely (especially if they aren't fully geared). They are also the easiest class to twink or powerlevel if you have a second account.<P>As for warriors being the only tank needed for raids, it's not because we have high HP or AC, or can do lots of damage swinging our swords. It's because we have the riposte disc at level 56.<P>As for being the staple in a group... completely untrue and it's a myth. A warrior is slightly more useful than a pally or shadowknight in that they have an extra 10% hp. This means a cleric can be a little bit more mana efficient. But honestly, we are hardly needed.<P>A lot of mention about taunt is occuring. I'm not sure what happens at 60th level when everyone is completely geared up, but I know at level 52 I can taunt effectively even while practicing my 2h blunt with an inferior weapon against a monk and rogue.<P>I'd like to see some sort of improvement with shield & 1h weapon skill. Make it viable for a warrior to wield a longsword and a shield - and not simply for resists.<P>I'd like to see 2h weapon damage upped dramatically - including some huge crits. High level 2h weapons are still inferior to fast 1h weapons in all cases. Especially at high levels where damage shields will always be dispelled. This isn't just for warriors, but all classes.<P>I'd like to see the regen capability of warriors increased to something that is not feasible to solo but could make a dent in downtime when in a group without complete healing.<P>I'd like to see a warrior get a bonus when healed by a greater heal or superior heal. Perhaps a continous discipline that doubles taunt, halves damage done but doubles the healing ability of healers (or specifically greater heal and superior heal). This would allow a group without a cleric to continue fighting in most places while not making them as efficient as a group with a cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a Level 54 Ogre Warrior. <P>I also play a level 54 Dwarven Cleric and a Level 51 High Elf Wizard.<P>But this is the warrior topic so I will put in a few comments here.<P>I taunt like a Mad man, I deal more Damage then all other classes except Monks with Epic weapons that are my level.<P>No mage, Necro or chanter Pet can even come close to beating me - no mater what level the caster is.<P>Soon I will be able to test myself against a Level 58 Magicians Epic Pet. I hope to do this tonight or tomorrow at the latest.<P>My point?<P>Warriors are an extremely well rounded class that I personaly feel are fairly well balanced now.<P>Alot of the posts I see fromo people here are way off mark.<P>At level 54 with fairly common gear - Cobalt Boots and Gloves - Indocolite Arms, Legs and Breast Plate I can easily get to 4700 HP Fully Buffed. But then again I understand Stamina is a Key Stat that I build.<P>I use Club of the Ice Ocean and a Silken Whip of Ensnaring to taunt - both weapons fairly common and easily acquired or traded for by someone level 50+ and those weapons keep the mobs on me most of the time. I have a Hard time when my level 58 Monk friend is around but I figure when I am level 58 myself I will taunt even better. But then again I also understand the dynamics of the game and if I am closer to the mob then the monk is I can easily keep the Mob targeted on me. The monks I fight with also understand this and simply take a step back - still in melee range but if I am closer to the mob then them I can keep the mobs attention longer.<P>As for the Epic weapons - well they are so rare and difficult to achieve - like all epic weapons should be - that I am not too concerned with them. I am of the opinion they simply rock as is.<P>Warriors Bind... I gotta ask... Why? Why should a warrior be able to bind? I have yet to hear any reasonable explanation as to why a warrior should be able to bind himself. At the level where it is difficult to get your body back if you die you are usually grouped with a Cleric.<P>I am sorry but I disagree with the request of warriors being able to Bind themsleves. I also Disagree with Warriors getting a "Mend" type skill that monks have.<P>We have more choices in armor and gear then any other class I know. We have more weapons to chose from then all other classes combined.<P>From reading the 7 pages of posts so far I don't think warriors need a thing to keep themselves Balanced, however it is painfully obvious that there needs to be a "Warrior trainging ground" to teach some folks how to "Hit stuff"<P>Yes at level 50 Monks can take warriors. And at level 60 Warriors can take Monks.<P>Presently I cannot count the number of Monks my level and even up to level 56 that I have fought and destroyed.<P>Rogues do their little Back stab and Monks do their little Monkey punches but neither would last very long without a Strong warrior standing next to them distracting the Mob and taking some Damage.<P>Most of the complaints and issues I have read thus far on this topic are posted by <BR>lower level warriors that don't know yet "but from what I understand" or<BR>Other classes or<BR>Those obviously bent on World Domination. You know the type "Warriors should get an Inherant ability to Proc IceComet at level 3, and should be able to use a Mend Skill that works 100% of the time and heals 90% of our health, oh yeah and should be able to Heal others in their group and they should be able to teleport group and self and oh yeah they should be able to cast buffs on themselves and.. and.. and..."<P>Anyway... I honestly think Warriors are fairly well balanced now. You just need to think about what is important to you and how you want to play. I have yet to hear anything that proves warriors are not balanced much less any good ideas on what to add to the class to improve upon it.<P>Remember if you want to taunt more then use procing weapons - nothing taunts like a spell<BR>If you want more Hit points then gear up on every piece of Stamina gear you can find<P>And just always remember AC is KING!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>couple of things id like to see done.<P>Increase HP.  We need more. nuff said.<P>Improve Taunt.  If we're gonna be the ones taking the damage we gotta be able to make sure that the mobs are gonna be hitting us.<P>100% bind wound.  Certainly an issue of great debate, but if done properly it would not be unbalancing to the healing classes and would allow us some solo ability during the off hours time that groups are limited.  Make PC tailored bandages that cost 5gp-1pp to make.  Most warriors i think wouldnt be able to afford too many of them given the standard tailor mark ups and would limit soloing simply because of the sheer cost.  <P>New skill to replace disarm.  Disarm doesnt do much and most mobs hit about as hard without weapons as they do with.  <P>more items with STA/DEX  STA/AC, DEX/AC  or STA/DEX/and AC combinations.  I know im reaching with the last one but as it stands most items to get dex u gotta sacrifice STA and AC or vise versa.<P>Warrior only quests.  Quests for items for warriors only that can only be done by warriors.  No outside help is allowed.  Would be nice to be able to do a quest without needing a full group or 2 to go get the items u need.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>[1] I would like to see some kind of weapons specialisation, perhaps similar to the magic specialisations that casters get.<P>Ex: My warrior gets to the level where he gets weapon specialisations. Once he puts a point into a specific type (say, 1HS specialisation) then that type would have a chance of going up. Only one specialisation could go above 50. All others would be capped at 50 (again, like magic specialisations).<P><BR>[2] I think it would be really beneficial to groups, if we had some way, at higher levels, to taunt a whole mob (as some have suggested, a sort of "AE taunt").<P><BR>Just my 2c worth!<P><BR>Cheers,<P>C.

</FONT><HR>I am a level 54 warrior, Half elf. I see these changes are necessary. I am posting it and it's page 8. I may have to put it at the top of another so it may actually get read.<BR>=============================================<BR>Improvements to TAUNT OR ALTERNATIVES To HELP WARRIOR TAUNT<BR>=============================================<BR>1.  Taunt(Skill): People say we have one. This would be an enhanced taunt. Only usefull after 200 tuant skill is reached(200 max Taunt @level 40). We need something between level 40 and 52. I'd like to see a skill like backstab which is a hot key skill that recycles during your fight like a tuant(need a good snappy name for it but haven't come up with one), but lack of a better name call is “Enrage Skill”. First to use you must have 200 taunt skill. Next you get it at like level 45 or 50. Hit it and it increases your taunt. Kind of like throwing an insult at a mobs..... Taunting an ogre for instance "Your %T (target) mother is a dwarf".(My appologies to all the mothers out there.) One more thing about a taunt skill, this can't be on one of those ridiculus long reuse timers that you put on disciplines and that’s why I call it a skill not a discipline. It could also be a fun one that when used the actual taunt comes out so everyone can see what you randomly say. This should have been in the game pre-50 and should not take away from our post 50 skills. Maybe if my "Battle Cry" suggestion below they can put a built in agro for it.<P>2.  Taunt(2):Some work needs to be done on the post 50 crowd. If you use this as the Taunt upgrade then make it work on post-50 mobs that resist normal taunts. It is better then it was. No mob should be untauntable. Maybe this is where the tuant hotkey comes in. The problem unless we have those weapons that the mega-uber warrior get then we have trouble to keep up with the agro upgrades that Verrant has given hybrids. So either raise the tuant cap or give us an extra tool.<P>3. New skill: "Battle Cry": Fear/Instill doubt? Rogues and Monks have these. I think warriors should have something like this only call it a "Battle Cry". Basically has same effect or maybe instead something like stunning the mob. You get a message like, "Taget is overcome by fear from so-and-so's battle cry." Instead of it running away maybe just be stunned for a couple secs.(really pie in the sky but might as well ask now). I am not an advocat of a warrior running from a fight. But there are times I'd like the opportunity to step back for a moment or 5 and reevaluate the wisdom of my actions. A couple seconds isn't much and since only large races get slam warrior really can't stun an opponent.<BR>===================================<BR>Disciplines - Suggestions<BR>===================================<BR>4.  Disciplines: Need longer(at least the offensive ones) durations(at least gain duration per level) and shorter recycle times. <P>5. Disciplines(Preferred Solution!!!) I'd also like to see the opportunity to use one offensive and one defensive. Take them off the same timer. But make the recycle based on the longer recovery one. I.E.: I use charge(build agro) then when done I use evade. I have the opportunity to build an agro and then warrior keeps mob enraged trying to hit him. <BR>===============================<BR>Offensive Improvements:<BR>===============================<BR>6.  Piercing: Since warriors are getting pushed into using piercing weapons our skill should be higher. There is no way we will ever come close to the damage of a rogue's backstab so I can't see a harm in this.  But I’m not to worried about this. This can stay the same.<P>7.  Critical/crippling hits: are a joke after level 35. My normal damage far exceeds my critical hit damage. Rarely do I get a critical hit that is significantly better then my normal damage. They are not tied to anything. I've been buffed 250 plus str and dex. and the frequency does not increase. The extra 9 or 10 points I get(when hit by my primary hand) doesn't cut it. I get more consistent crits with a bow and kicking and my off hand weapon. Lets cap the lower end of the crit/crip and bump the higher end with an additional bonus for crit every way they come, primary or secondary hand weapons, bows, throwing, bash(slam) and kick. I am not just a meat shield I should be a walking weapons too.  For the most part I am but the eye candy needs to be better if it is going to be a rare occurance as it is now. Nothing was more embarrassing then getting a 1 point crit with a wurmslayer. <P>I suppose that critical hits should be increased in frequency based on your weapon/offense skill to. If you have dual wield/double attack/offense weapon skill maxed there should be a greater perentage of crit hits per fight. Crippliing hits were nonexistant(8 in 42 levels) until I got the skill at 54. <P>8. Why doesn’t the message that says so-and so gets a critical hits show the full damage in the open message? <P>9.  Slam: wonderful thing to have. But only large races have this skill. I think monks and warriors should get a form of this. Monk can be like shaman that get slam have. It will have no skill raising ability(can't get better at it) but can disrupt a caster and the downside will be they can’t use one of the special attacks while it recycles. For instance if a warrior uses bash they can’t kick too. All warriors should have this regardless of race. Yes, large races get it as a race thing. But I am of the opinion that no warrior should have to use a shield to disrupt a caster. Kick is very ineffective. The alternative is make kick effective.<BR>============================================<BR>Other Stuff<BR>============================================<BR>9.  Binding Points: Someone started a thread on this. I think we need a few more bind points. There should be a three zone limit unless you have to go thru zone like West Karana. Sol Temple would be good one. And maybe something nearer to Guk.(Upper guk would get used more then just by farmers). Maybe a back unguarded entrance to Cabilis?(a Thieves entrance?)<P>10.  Keys: This is a complaint by all classes but we closingin on having 8 to 12 soul bound keys possibly. Thes take up vital inventory slots. We need a key ring for at least all the portal keys in Velious and preferably a key ring for the keys of Kunark. No key rings for key to dungeons in Anotica, Odus and Faydwer. <P>11.  Binding wounds: should have been at least 150 before pre50 and probably should have been 200 like monks.<P>12. More hit points. The periodic bonuses are nice but post 50 we should get a bonus every level. The hps don’t come close to keeping up with the mobs damage beyond level 50.<BR>=============================================<BR>Quests:<BR>=============================================<BR>12.  Warrior Only quests: This is true for all classes. I want my quest completable only by members of my class. I can't stand farmers. Most notable, the hero bracer. I will get flamed for this but this is one of the nicest items a warrior can quest for pre-level 46(Plane of armor). They(warriors) still need help killing the final mob but someone who is not a melee type shouldn't bbe able to turn in 30 or 50 orc belts to gain faction to get this quest. This item should have remained no drop warrior only. <P>I can understand may be a ranger, a bard or a paladin earning the item(thru long term extreme efforts) but not shadow knights(give them an equivalent). And not druids(insert any kiting classes, or those who farm guards) who kill guards then go to the commons to buy their faction back and then to blackburrow to kill themselves gack into the good graces of the Steel Warriors.<P>13.  Warriors Quests Continued: I think that each warrior guild should have a quest that results in weapons equivalent to the langseax quest. These are probably the best quest in all of norath yeilding a great weapon usable for the level it can be gained(mid teens) and usable for a long time.<BR>============================================<BR>EPIC  QUEST<BR>============================================<BR>Epic Quest: I've posted volumes on this. I realize you don’t think this is a balance issue but if I have to wait until I’m level 60 to wield these(probably never) then it is not balanced with other classes. In a nutshell the warrior FA quest  is a scavenger hunt. Go out kill totally unrelated mobs(no story line or clues) to hope to get the RAREST drops off each. Not to mention you have to hope the mob is even up(long respawn times). We need an army to kill every mob we need a drop from. I'd like them to at least increase the frequency(to 50%?) or best make it an everytime drop. If Maestro is holding a weapon he's got to have hands. <P>How bout balance the quests out between classes. Make new mobs and drop these items every time or are pop-able?  Rewrite the thing from scratch. Get the person who took the time to think out the Shaman and Rogues quest to do it. There is no balance if most every Rogue has their FA weapons now and most clerics and shaman too but only one or two warriors on every server have them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, now i havent the time to read Everything but i doubt this was said...<P>What about Prayer? (wait, hear me out...)<P>To those warriors that believe in gods that is.. and not just for Warriors either! this could work for all classes!<P>What role do the gods play? sure, sometimes they are killed, or pop up in a GM-Event..but..<P>My dwarven warrior is lost.. he is running from many a foe, there is not a zone, nor help to be seen, he is injured and quite near death. What would a faithfull-Brell worshiping dwarf do in that situation? well, PRAY to his god of course!<P>I'm thinking something like a Random Proc, depending on several factors, perhaps your faction With your god, the things you are fighting and THEIR faction, etc...  <P>not exactally a SKILL, but an ability "Prayer"<BR>Perhaps it could be handled like a skill, but the higher 'skill' in it you are wont really affect much.<P>doesnt have to be answered all the time.<P>ex: that dwarf is running from a mass of Iskar. he starts praying to his god .. you know how it goes.. "if only i can get through this ill....".. suddenly perhaps he starts running faster (sow) or his health increases... maybe he could receive a sort of 'message' from his god, go make a donation at the nearest temple or something.. etc...<P>I'd just like to see some kind of other bonus for believing in a god besides just a Faction bonus/hit.<P>Warriors as a overall class seem to be just fine (21st dwarven warrior here..) Although it Would be nice for them to have SOME skill that noone else has (at lower levels, and perhaps period.) Warriors DONT have magic (and in the case of my dwarf, are alergic to it and generally dont trust magic users..)  SOMETHING else to make them stand out... perhaps the ability to go Bezerk (sp?) at more than 1 bulb of health.. like say at Half health.. or some sort of a SKILL like 'bloodlust' that just makes you go into a Rage (perhaps INT drops, or even Agility or something, but you miss less...)<P>I played a human paladin up to 18th level, and in a Quarter of that time i got my new dwarf to 21st. The Warrior is a great class and needs very little (if anything) to make it darn near perfect..<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Basically Taunt is huge.  We need AE taunt also.  AC doesnt make a big enough difference.....i get hit for close to the same amount of damage naked or with equip.  The factor seems very small.  How about something for all class like a small chance to turn a mobs spell back on him with high MR?  That would be awesome Roleplaying wise.<P>And our Epic is completely stupid.

</FONT><HR>Ok....just can't believe my eyes here. 1st of all....HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! HIT POINTS! Alan....that is truley the problem with warriors. That is what is supposed to set us apart from ALL other classes. Now I realize that the answer to this will be...."Well, warriors DO have the most HP's!" Tell me...If I as a warrior  only have a few hundred more Hp's (if that!) than the SK, Ranger, or Pally thats swinging blades beside me, that means I MAY live to fight a second or two longer than a Hybrid. Now does that seem like too big of a warrior advantage? I'll let you decide. And all these fancy triggerd skills people want warriors to have, which are really just geared to make warriors more "fun"? OH Yeah....Real Neat! Whoop! Im more worried about staying alive to keep my thin skinned mates breathing. Armor? If you ask me....I think it's pretty fair, even though Hybrids are dern close in thats area, but that makes sense to me. A BIG hp change would in no way unbalance the warrior. Look at it this way...at lvl 60, you give a warrior 1k more hp, send him to fight that Lvl 45 wurm in BW, and guess what? He still dies, and does 2 to 400 more damage to the wurm in that last 20 seconds hes alive. WHOOP! Oh yeah...we are TOO tuff now. But its cool that druid over there will solo the same mob at lvl 49 fairly easily. (been there, done that BTW)Anyway...Sorry if this sounds to ranty, but for I have not posted 1 rant about warriors in 2 years of playing one, but there comes a time when you see every Hybrid around you on a fast track to match you while you stay the same, same, same. (I know...there have been a few changes in the past 2 years, but nothing as groundbreaking as I've seen for most hybrids) Also, Im not disagreeing with all the other ideas on taunt, new skills, armor, etc. I just think that HP's are what warriors are in need of most. And again I say and its true, givin a warriors abilities, a big increase in HP would not overpower us, no way, no how. Not at higher levels anyway. Thanks.  <P>               </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After 50 we get some disciplines, but I'd like to see some things filter down that other classes get early in their lives.<BR>Bind Wounds - This skill caps out too quick and warriors should be given either another skill as an upgrade or just make it faster after you reach a certain level. Example of another skill that could be given in the beginning would be "rest" where the warrior's screen blackens leaving him vulnerable to his surroundings, but increases regen rate.<P>Taunt - The warriors main purpose in a group is to be the meat shield, so why not give us some more taunting skills. I like the idea of a War Cry which could act like an AE Taunt. How bout a taunt that could act like a tick of bard fear or short stun. Course I understand that these skills would take longer to recover, but it would add elements needed to better polish the warrior with his other melee counterparts.<P>Weapon Specialization - I can see where all warriors would pry pick 1hs as their specialization, but as you specialize in something additional bonuses could occur. Say, 2hs you get the AE slash, 1hs and piercing you get better crits, 2hb and 1hb you get a short stun, etc...<P>Kyro Spiralfist<BR>41st Warrior - Solusek Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>ok there are way to many posts to read on this.lol  I got to like the end of the first page and go "ummmm I'm just gonna post mine and stop reading.hehe"  ok most my ideas have already been stressed repeadidly I'm sure but I'll do it agian cause if I don't post, then I have no right to argue that VI does nothing to help Warriors.<P>1)  Taunt<BR>  FIX THE DARN THING!!!  I swear I get in a group and taunt like crazy and all it takes is a ranger or someone to cast heal or snare and boom mobs off me and on them.  Its just insane.<P>2) Damage Dealing<BR>  "I suck."  Thats what goes through my mind when I'm fighting along side a ranger or a rogue (well not so much a rogue).  Sure Rangers get less hp and defensive skills, but their higher damage compensates for that and they get agro'd a lot by the mobs I'm taunting (see above).  Then I take a look at Wizies and Mages and the like.  Sure they high dmg dealin casters, especially Wizards, but I have failed to be able to taunt the mobs off them due to the fact that they do more damage (respectfully) than I can.  I'm not askin for us to be able to hit like a Wiz casts but an up in dmg deal out would help with the agro.<P>3) Disciplines<BR>  I haven't gotten any and from what I can see after 35 we get the short end of the deal.  We get nodda till 50 or so.  *shrug* nothin wrong with that I guess, but when we get disarm at 35 that was a fairly big let down for me.  I try to obtain it so hard then when i get it I dumped 25 practice points in it hoping it would benefit me some way, then come to find out its useless in Velious and Kunark and fairly any other place.<P>*A New Discipline*<BR>  That would be cool.  One that actually did something decent!  Like duel weild 2hs!  I saw it posted on the first page and I had that idea a while back just jokin with a friend.  Warriors are suppose to be masters of dmg and weilding weapons, so why not after 50 or something we get to duel weild 2h's?  That would help out with our taunt effectiveness.<P>4) Epic Weapons<BR>  I looked at most of the epic weapons and thought that ours was a bit difficult compared to others, then I read more indepth to ours and knew it was more difficult, then I read posts from some of the people that got it and go MY GOD THERE IS NO WAY!!!!!!<P>  If the cleric and enchanter items of the mobs in Chardok drop 100% and they are better than our War epics and our components drop like 40% of the time, then whats the point in even tryin for it?  As mentioned on page one most of the tank/dmg dealers got a haste buff with their weapons, we get some nice procs sure but that won't help out the haste situation.

The Sk's and Pal's get their spells to heal themselves and stuff, we get ...well....well gee I can't think of anything.lol<P>6) Summary<BR>  ok Increase taunt and dmg dealt, do something about the epic components, fix that darn cobalt armor drop (wasn't mentioned in my post), and give us (or fix) a decent Discipline.<P>Colosis Gladorion<BR>35th lvl Dwarven Warrior</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please look into the drop rate of the Cobalt Bracer, and the Cobalt Helm.  Cobalt Bracer drops randomly off the mushrooms in Sebilis.  And the Cobalt Helm drops randomly off Reet frogs in Sebilis.  <P>Now, I'm willing to bet that drop rate you have set for them is the exact same as the drop rate for Cobalt Arms (which drop randomly off Zol Knights in Sebilis).  However, this is not balanced, because you can kill Zol knights easily with a 6 man group.  The mushrooms and reet knights, on the other hand, are higher level, have a ton more hit points, and require a multi-group raid.  (Yes it is POSSIBLE to do them with 1 mega-powerful group....but if you do that, you are killing the mobs VERY slowly with lots of down time).<P>Both the bracer and the helm need their drop rates increased double or triple what they are now to compensate for the fact that the mobs they drop off of are higher level, have more hit points, and require multiple groups to kill a significant number of them in any given time period.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Spam:  Our own weapons strikes spam us.  Try playing a level 60 warrior and see what I mean.  Duel wpns and triple attack.  I'd like a filter.  "You hit 5 times for 281 damage."  Much better then 5 seperate hit messages.  I dont particularly care whether it was crushing, piercing, slashing, crit or hands.  Note you cant filter your own hits out.  And while I dont think it would be wise to entirely filter out your hits, something to help us deal with it is needed.  The other option is seperate battle and communication chat boxes for melee.  <P>5.  Tabbing through the /reply list causes us to switch targets to ourselves thus making it impossible to fight and talk without constantly resetting our target.<P>6.  Something that affects all levels of melee is weapon switching.  It would be nice if only while fighting it wasn't possible to drop items.  I realize you can turn on the switch but I dont like to have that yes/no question come up while I'm fighting.<P>7.  I bash/kick mobs and they just keep casting.  As we have leveled up the spells have gotten more powerful and faster, but kick/bash have remained at the same delay.  I'd recommend from 51-60 a gradual speed improvement from 50 to 30 delay.  Kick doesnt add alot of damage (roughly 2%), but it is our ability to deal with casters.  It no longer does the job because of constant skill and spell improvements.  Remember it isnt as if we always hit.  Often you can go 3-4 kicks/bashs without hitting or affecting the mob, thus 15-20 seconds without being able to use our ability when timing and interrupting is crucial.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off Id like to mention as most others have..warriors are fairly balanced already. However there are a few things Id like to see happen.<P>Taunt. Its been said again and again but I completely agree..taunt needs to be more effective. This is our role in a group. I liked the area effect taunt idea. A warrior should be able to taunt multi creatures by lets say letting out a blood curdling war cry to distract the mobs  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Heres something which relates to other classes but has the most impact on warriors..Im talking only about PvP servers here. On a PvP server we loose faction even when we duel (it makes no sense..two friends can't duke it out just for fun? the penalty is far to great. we can't even hold guild tournys without the faction) The reason I say this is more so hurting the warrior class is this. On PvP we compensate for the faction hits through dueling by only fighting till we hit a bub of hp then the fights over and the looser zones. Well Im sure everyone can see the down fall for warriors here..our berserker frenzy doesn't kick in till under half life..a warriors best fighting is before death! Im sure its been mentioned but I really think dueling should not give faction on PvP.<P>Rone Windstream ~The Knights of the Silver Moon~<BR>Half Elven Warrior<BR>34 seasons<BR>Vallon Zek (PvP)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I do think that there's just a couple ways to improve warriors.  They do need a more effective taunt, which would help all classes.  The biggest problem monks, rogues, and rangers have is that it's hard for the warrior to taunt off them.  If their taunt was about equal to a ranger's snare + taunt (which I use to get mobs off the casters in the group, and is generally quite effective), then it would be better for all melee classes.<P>Another skill for higher lvls would also be nice for them, and one that higher lvl hybrids wouldn't get.  This would help differentiate them a little from hybrids while not overly upsetting the balance.  I'm not sure what this skill should be, possibly an extra defensive move since they are the best defensive melee class in the game.<P>I've seen some talk about more hp's for warriors, but they really don't need it, especially the larger ones.  What race you pick is your choice, if someone picks a gnome or wood elf warrior, for example, then you won't have as many hp as an ogre one.  They still have more hp than any hybrid class.<P>That's my 2cp on the subject.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>if you actually get down to this post god bless you &lt;g&gt;<P>Regardless, however, I feel I *must* respond.<P>at Level 31, I feel fairly well balanced in groups.  <P>More Taunt is the #1 issue here, as I have also seen situations where I'm the least damaged combatant in a group.  It doesn't happened often, but it happens.  More likely it's another tank type whose hammering away doing all that wonderful damage and me trying to taunt the mob of him before he dies.  (How many times have I told someone to stop hitting for a second while I taunt it off...)  More HP's is nice and so is better stamina.  <P>My real issues are:<P>Binding.  Oh how I hate to die in dungeons.  And you know what - it's extremely common since if I go in - I damn well better be able to walk out cause if it hits the fan and we start a running - I'm a dead man.  And when I'm dead - the entire group can get back in action without me.  Do they stop?? nah - they can handle things ( a bit slower) without me...<P>Please make this something I'm not dependant on other people for.  <P>What are other classes dependant on Warriors for??  I'm dependant on Druids for Traveling.  I'm dependant of Clerics for Healing. What do they depend on me for??   <P>And How does a Warrior make money?  Druids have so many built in money makers it's funny.  My druid friends make money hand over fist (1k on TP's alone in a few months time) while I make...not very much.  Clerics make money doin res's.  Enchanters make money doing .... Bards make money...  Get the point??  And don't say become an armorer or such.  ANYONE can do armor.  Only Clerics can resurrect etc.  <P>Travelling in Norrath as a warrior is so difficult - I find I just don't.  I play in one area and if someone wants me - they come out and get me.  It's boring and I miss guild events all the time, but there are just so few options.  And now, sure, I make a few plat killin stuff (Not in Velious Iceclad of course) but I don't WANT to pay 10 platnum pieces to some druid just to cast a spell.  What robbery.  I just don't have the money making capability to replace that 10 plat.  I'm saving for some nicer weapon or armor.  (Which I never get cause I die and have to pay some cleric or druid or both to help me do a CR.)<P>Sure I have friends who can do these things - but they aren't always online - and some of them don't own Velious.  <P>I really love playing a warrior in groups - hammering away - helping your groupmates - watching a battle play itself out.  <P>But finding a group is tough and living without one is impossible.  Use that as a summary of what is wrong with Warriors.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Cobalt Bracer and Cobalt Helm is way way way way way too rare.  There are probably around 10 of each on my entire server.  They are located in areas that require raid type groups, and are set up with some incredibly small drop percentage.  Perhaps somewhere in the range of 1 in 500 mobs.  This type of drop percentage is fine at the sebilis zone-in.  But that deep in, the risk increases hugely, the mobs are hugely more powerful, and require multiple groups, and so the rewards should be increased.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Warriors are nicely balanced. I think that there are a few minor things that need to be tweaked still.<P>Mainly Taunt. Taunting still doesn't produced much effect in high level combats. Group me with a few monks with decent weapons and I will never be able to taunt the critter off of them. I don't agree with that senario. When a warrior taunts, I expect the creature to be so pissed off at the warrior that it would take a dozen monks to pull it offa him. Honestly, Warriors need to have their taunt cap increased or the amount of agro increased from their taunts.<P>Some additional damage would be nice also. Crits need to happen more frequently and with higher damage ratios. With some of the most deadly weapons in the game and a 255 str my damage output is still fairly low in comparision to monks. Tossing in a few more crits here and there and increasing those crit damages would help a bit.<P>Overall the warrior class is pretty stable. The disciplines helped us out a lot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with Filo, warrior taunt needs to be improved still. Any spell cast has a greater taunt affect then the taunt skill. This is a large problem for zones like Plane of Growth. In this zone a caster does not even need to cast a spell and only needs to be sitting when a mob enters camp. The mobs like the sprites and protectors will agro directly on a caster (usualy a cleric) and its almost a sure bet the caster will be killed before you can get it off them. and god forbid someone casts a spell on them, then you get to play chase the mob for the next 5 mins unable to taunt because you can not either see the mob or its too far away. Taunt needs to be fixed so that it is reasonably expected that a mob can be taunted. a warrior should not have to depend on a weapon proc to do his taunting for him.<P>A few of our disciplines need some work, such as the offensive ones like furious and mighty strike, for example. The disciplines are too short in duration and reuse time (about an hour) is far too long. Taking from the agro vs taunt above these skills are pretty much useless, since these disciplines last such a short time. and who wants to use something that doesnt realy do much and have to wait an hour to use them again. These two need to have their duration increase to say 15-20 seconds and have their use time cut in half. Also fellstrike does not seem to do the at least 4X damage as claimed.<P>The only other gripe i have is concerning the epic weapon. Why should warriors spend the huge amount of time working towards this when much better weapons can be obtained normaly. So the epic has stats and resist and a proc, that is not a reason to use the weapon. damage output is most important in a weapon. why use the 1 handed versions over say a willsapper and dagas. these weapons produce more damage and the hp and ac provided from the degas more important that resists from the epics. Add ac to the 1 handers and drop their delay to around 20. for the effort required these are by far not the best weapons a warrior can use. The two version seems nice but the damage needs to be higher like the 40 on the SK weapon. As a warrior i want a weapon that make people say holy #@$@ when i hit something. this is why warriors use duel wield with 1 handers, not just so they can actualy taunt but damage output is much better than 2 handers. for the 2 hander i think a random effect of producing something such as the mightstrike discipline would be much better than a proc. something that would provide a realy big hit on occasion.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

On warrior only items, we’re talking about magical items that were made for specifically for a warrior - We really don’t need Wisdom or Intelligence. And Charisma is okay, but you could ease back on that too. Not nearly enough Neck Shoulder and Back Items. Not nearly enough Good AC +resist gear.<P>The major Point I see being raised here, is that Taunt is the big thing. I have a suggestion.<P>At level 1 Paladins and Shadow Knights Get LoH and DT – I know this compensates them for not having spells for the first 8 levels and is a class defining skill. I’d like something in that same vein for Warriors.<P>A once a day ability that will Immediately Frenzy one Mob onto me, allowing me to guarantee once a day that I will be able to save one life of a cleric, enchanter or healer. I think this would be in no way overpowering or unbalancing.<P>I also see a great need for Disarm to be looked at. I posted on this a while back – it is a totally useless skill outside duels and possibly PvP – as Warriors are the red headed step child of PvP (Not Duels) – this is no reason for this skill to be kept in this vein. I would increase the recycle time somewhat and make it possible to process some kind of 2/3 second stun.<P>Critical Hits – these should ALWAYS interrupt spells and ALWAYS process any effect.<BR>Criticals on bash/kick/slam should always result in a stun, or in the case of bash/slam and high level kicks a longer stun.<P>Set a minimum damage on Crits = to twice Dmg stat.<P>Higher level skills – <P>Replacing Disarm at 35th - A second improved taunt. "Enrage"?<P>At 40th - AoE Taunt. Slower recycle time than taunt, smallish AoE should not interrupt Mez<P>At 45th - War Cry Long Recycle (Similar to length of Mend) AOE 1 sec stun followed by Major aggro on Tank (But war cry does break Mez)<P>Seeing as Warriors have no aid from spells or ability for travelling, how about allowing us to Sprint as ability. Again, long recycle time, fairly short duration but increases speed by 25% while decreasing stamina (Yellow bar) When down to the final bub of stamina, movement returns to normal speed, and AC gets reduced by 25% until Yellow bar returns to Full.<BR>This will allow for the occasional quick escape from the green hordes, and also allow us to chase down that Mob before he brings a train, while compensating by making us take a major hit on our defense.<P>On Bash/Slam stuns – can you add “Mob X is Stunned” if a stun is successful.<P>Lastly, as posted – rare drops off uber mobs to get our epics is just mean – please look at ways to address this without making them as easy to get as Rogue/Cleric items.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For all Melee-Classes:<P>unlock all disciplines, increase the time until they repop but unlock them it would enhance the fighters abilities and reduce the boredom of hack and slay, and dont tell players lies about questing, most qeust stuff is poor compared to loot of moderate difficult mobs, and include a lot of time many dont have. Dont come with the Velious Quests, great how u made them for uber guilds, actually I wont ever see the zones where to get the quest components (which seem to drop from dragons?!)... so please stop putting in stuff for uber guilds and put some fun into the class so I can stop hunting for pp and stuff to buy better gear cause actually its all about gear,<BR>oh yeah its so great to make that decision when to press the taunt button or which mob to pull.<BR>Just one question: How is it so unbalancing to unbreak the disciplines ? give examples and then think of the mobs we fight at that level !! my god : ripost discipline plus crit discipline thats insane damage for some seconds, but what is it compared to a few spells of a wizard... and it will be possible only once in a real time hour (if u play 2 hours a day u may have the chance to do it twice) sure we are for tanking well ITS BORING as BORING as being a cleric nonstop medding healing.<P>sorry if it got a bit sore and angry but if u get out after playin so much for the disciplines that it was worth nothing and u just depend on gear that u wont ever see until u can solo a dragon (when the hell freezes).<P>Make class specific stuff lootable only by the class that can use it make it lore and no drop.<BR>Sure it may destroy a kind of market but also it may allow some people to get something. <BR>Dont you feel a bit hate if you check a certain area a dozen times a week just to get out that its 24/7 camped by a level 60 necro ?<BR>as an Idea to stop singles from camping something:<BR>let randomly spawn some supporting forces only a full group might be able to defeat.<P>but because you dont ever change something and want only to change a few numbers cause its the easiest then reduce the time til disciplines repop or the duration of a disciplines (and maybe u go through the usefulness of the disciplines again) like u did for the hybrids.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In regards to Nurok-KIC<BR>I understand where you are coming from, but you are putting yourself in your boots and not the boots of the typical warrior.<P>You have exceptional gear for your level. Other players who do not have alternates, lots of coin or a big guild to do raids will have far inferior gear to you and will feel a lot different about the supposed power of the warrior. Even though this gear can be bought, many warriors simply don't have the coin. I have fought for 7 levels in Karnors (since 45) and my total lootage has been 1 jarsath trident.<P>The point I'm making is that you can take a well-equipped warrior and use them for the balance factor, but that isn't fair to quite a few players (on 7th Hammer I'd say the majority - I know of VERY FEW level 54 warriors who have the gear you do). Or you can take a average warrior for balancing and then you'll end up with a few people who are uber.<P>As for killing pets... bah, who cares. That's hardly a factor in determining balance. I agree with your statement that warriors in low fifties can taunt fine. Maybe the mob doesn't hit you 100% of the time, but easily the majority. I can't talk about post 55 with classes who have good gear equipped though.<P>Binding issue isn't really a big deal post 50, but pre-fifty often determines what you can do and where you can go.<P>And the one arguement that stands true is that a warrior is the worst class in the game without a cleric - and by a very long ways too.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some friendly facts to the warriors wanting more AC, HP, etc. and mentioning paladins/shadow knights being close in this area when they do so:<P>PAL/SHD vs. WAR (Defense)<P>Defense:  230/252 - 91.2% <BR>Hit Points: 75-87% (85% for argument's sake - yes all unbuffed - cleric buffs have same effect on all 3 classes) <BR>Dodge: 155/175 - 88.6% <BR>Parry: 205/230 - 89.1% <BR>Riposte: 200/225 - 88.9% <BR>Wearable Armor: (Cobalt vs. Blood Ember/Deepwater ) 177/220 - 80.4%  &lt;--- well lookee here... (this I find puzzling personally, I see no logic here, considering all of the above, and PAL/SHD offense caps, no dual wield or kick)<P>Some Theoretical calucations....<BR>Total Defense Ability vs. Warrior if all things considered of equal importance:<BR>(0.912*0.85*0.886*0.891*0.889*0.804)<BR>Paladins and Shadowknights tank 43.7% as well as a Warrior assuming all varibles considered equal contributors to defense as a whole.<P>Considering only Defense Skill, Hit Points and Wearable Armor : 62.3% (let's be generous and say PAL/SHD tank 65% as well as warriors.)<P>Want to consider only rate of damage taking?  Ok that would be just Defense Skill and Wearable Armor (I'll be generous and exclude dodge, parry, riposte)... 0.912*0.804 = PAL/SHD are 73.3% as good as warriors for taking damage over time.<P>Another fact: similarly equipped rogues and monks have higher AC than paladins and shadow knights at 60.<P>Just some facts for digestion.<P>See ya in the Paladin Thread Alan  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Good luck warriors with your new ideas.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Almost forgot.<P>Battle Spam... It sure would be nice to be able to turn off "MY" damage output and the creatures damage output. Sometimes you want pure a pure wuite setting without any battle spam at all. Mainly during massive fights. It would be really handy if all chat outputs could be turned off and on.<P>Also...<P>Epics. We have a pretty tough quest. Two things need to change though.<P>1. Getting into the Queen room in Chardock and actually killing her is a major acomplishment for alot of guilds. She is far harder to kill than the overking. Warriors take it in the shorts really bad here, because she only drops the hilt less than 25% of the time. I could understand if she was a mob that was easy to get to, and not insanely difficult to kill that having it a random drop off her would be ok, but the queen is niether.<P>2. Getting a massive group together to run Sky and actually making it to the 6th island is also a "nearly" impossible chore. Then we have to kill the spiroc lord and hope a winged spiroc blade drops. Problem is that the blade again, is a random drop.<P>I suggest in both cases that the items always drop. This doesn't make the task of getting them from the mobs any easier, it simply makes it gaurenteed that "IF" you do succeed, you will be rewarded with the item needed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, whre to start.<P>1)Increase our taunting ability.<P>2)Make us the masters or arms we were billed to be. It pains me to see other classes with better weapons than I can use, mainly in the name of "balancing the classes". <P>3)The Epic weapon is a joke for what we go through to get it. Put a haste effect on it that stacks with items and spells. Please lighten the wieght of it. Also, the delay on the one hand versions is to high for the post 50 crowd.<P>4)Add a Battle Cry Discipline. This would be an area effect taunt with a set radius and would taunt all mobs in that radius. The refresh rate should be 10 minutes or less and should not be tied in with the other disciplines.<P>5)Effects on our high end armor is horrid. The only ones I like are the Str on the cobolt boots, the shrink on the bracers, and the vision on the helm. We wants stats and constant effects. We are warriors and don't care to be clicking on items every 20 minutes. <P>6)Shields, I know most wont and don't sue these at all. Why? They are not good enough for us to sacrifice on the damage we do without one. Make a shield worth us giving up our offhand weapon and we might us one from time to time. ie a 50plus AC +to stats + to resistances and an effect like rubicite aura or regrowth. Now a shield like that would get some use. I know some would say this is unbalancing, but I don't see how it is. Paladins have a sword that give 45 AC, that is 2 less than our best breastplate at this time. There is the fungul tunic that has regrowth as an effect. So this would be inline with those objects. Ok, maybe this is just a wet dream, but it is worth a try.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;RANT AS TO WHY ENHANCEMENTS ARE NEEDED&gt;<BR>How much use is a warrior to a group that doesnt have one of the primary healing classes:  Druid, Shaman, Cleric?<P>Not much.  Damn near useless after a few fights of getting beat up.  If you have a paladin in the group you can be useful every 5 minutes when the paladin heals you up to full after spending all his mana.<P>On the other hand, how useful is EVERY other class (besides rogues) in such a situation?  Very.  Every other class has other tactics they can fall back on.<P>So when you address warriors balance, just remember that unless you find one of the 3 primary healer classes that WANT to group (Yeah, find me a druid that likes to group, I dare ya.) in teh zone you're in, you're useless.  Spend an hour looking for that cleric that logs 15 min after you join up.<BR>&lt;END RANT&gt;<P>My (modest) wish list:<BR>- Enhance warrior taunt so that you can affect things other than low blues<BR>- Change the way 2HS vs dual wielding affects aggro.  I play an ogre warrior that walks around smashing things with a big stick (mithril staff).  I would hope that my smashing in a kly's skull for 93 points of damage acts as more of a taunt than that silly ranger hitting it 3 times for 12 points of damage.  Dont force role playing ogres to run around like idiots wielding little jade maces.<BR>- Change the caps on bind wounds.  Why shouldnt a warrior be able to solo post 35 and be able to get back up to 1/2 health in less than 20 min.  Make SOME option available to a warrior that plays on odd hours and cant find one of the 3 healer classes.  Even if its an expensive, time consuming propostion we should be able to solo a thing or 2.<P>Thank you for listening<BR>Scrab Smashguud<BR>Basher of da 30th broken skull<BR>Seventh Hammer<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of my main concerns about the warrior class is, that the warriors themselves are way too unbalanced between the races. We have the 3 main warrior races ogre, troll, barbarian and we have the rest. As we all know the only stat that really has any impact on the class right now is stamina. All other stats are just eyecandy. Strength, dex, agi are not even worth to talk about. Somehow though Verant decided to make stamina items very rare. You don't proc more with 150 dex than with 85 dex, the damage output at 235 and 170 strength is almost the same and the ac bonus of higher agility is laughable. Either you start to fix the other stats (in which other than the 3 named races are superior in) or you should put in some for warriors highly desireable stamina items.<BR>Put in a quest item for trolls and ogres that has the effect of the guise of deceiver (unnerfed). You stated that it should be a penalty for being a large race, in fact you punish all other melees who can't see jack behind a fattie (and are out of reach for hitting of course). Not every mob you have to fight with several groups is a dragon.<BR>Rarity of cobalt armor was already mentioned 500 times, same as drop rates of epic quest items. To give also Wuoshi a green scale would make sense. One guy here mentioned that it would be a challenge to hold Queen room in Chardok. Sorry, but I have to disagree. There are 2 challenges. The first challenge is to bug your guild/friends for the xxx time for a Queen raid (just to meet another couple of queens without blades) and to break into the room. Once in the room, it is a cakewalk and no challenge at all. It is just a long and boring camp. What sense does it make to park level 60 warriors in Hate who already have a full set of indico or even Cobalt armor? Furthermore, while we are talking about sense, which sense does a Maestro of Wussy make who can hold a lute and/or a bard weapon without a hand? I am still confused about this "logic".<BR>I am not commenting on the Epic reward till I have it though.<BR>Female woodelves with a bucket...../panic. The model for plate helms on female woodelves is a shame for the designer. I hope this guy will never find a job again. As Aanya said, looks are important. Said to say that I am running around with a Crown of King Tranix instead of a nice indico/cobalt helm. Humans are damn close to woodelves but woodies top it all. They are the creme de la creme of ugliness with a bucket. Malee woodelves are not much better with that "dead bird" in front of their head. The champion's crown is one nice item to have (in opposite to the berserker version because of the +7 sta) but why is it called a crown when it has the same bucket look as usual? Is it so difficult to give new items new displays? Starnge, strange, strange. A different colour isn't cool at all.<BR>Thanks for reading<P>Nadeniel<BR>Woodelf Warlord<BR>Drinal<BR>"who will never wear a bucket"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052809&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052809&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
