</FONT><HR> I started the game with a friend at the same time ... haveing know him from my meny years as a pen and paper GM i knew he liked the power leveling side of the game so when he kept telling me not to waist time with the trade skills / quests / languages / or any thing like that and just level as fast as i can i did not listen to him ... big mistake ...<P>I went on to master 6 trade skills now (smithing , tailoring , pottery , brewing , fletching , jewlery in order done) as well as  do some quests lern 20+ languages , set up an network of field agents to supply me with high Quality bear skins ... all a waist of time , why ...<P>Becaus wail i was doing all this my friend  was leveling and now he is level 50 with all the great items id like to have but cant go get ... further more with nerf after nerf after nerf after nerf after nerf .... ect ... with no end of the nerfs in sight , i am not only am a weaker class than i was then but most of the things i want to go get have had their drop nerfed or what drops them beefed up ...<P>By way of example i was lucky enugh to be the first one to the Mitty Kitty camp after the last patch , i just happened to log in right as the servers came up and i got the camp after trying for 3 weeks ... being my first camp i had no idea what i was in for ... 14 hours of killing green mobs later i had to log ... i turned the camp over to another and checked in with him the next day , nothing , another took over ... 29 hours later nothing ... no gold ring in 2 and 1/2 days ... so after 4 combined petitions we finly get an answer from a guide that would ask a GM ... the drop was nerfed to VERY RARE ... and this was not the only item 'adjusted'.<P>If this is the kind of **** i have to go throu for the top end items no thanks ... and if i cant play the top end what the heck am i waisting my time for ? This nerf is not the reason im leaveing the game , its just the nerf that broke this players back.<P>so , if your thinking about dumping your time into trade skills a warning ... level wail you can or youll be nerfed AGAIN wail your back is turned and miss out on your chance to  get them levels in wail you can .</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Wow...<P>I can't understand it... some of the most fun I have is just working my trade skills, or going fishing with my regular hunting partner!  Killing beasties got old to me after lvl 5, and the diversions included in the game (like quests and trade skills) have REALLY made this game enjoyable.  For those of you who are driven to advance in levels, think about it... once you hit lvl 50 (or 75, once the expansion comes out), there's no where to go!  The desire to lvl is forcibly taken away from you, and by then trade skills are useless to you (why would you even WANT to make an enchanted silver ring at lvl 50???).  By then, all you can do is complain about plane raids like you complain about things now (this is really REALLY not meant to flame, but the perfect example of this is the attempt to obtain the "gold ring" at the Mitty Kitty camp.  You're not the only one to get frustrated about this either, but I cannot uderstand why people get so worked up about it in the first place).<P>Personally, I feel sorry for those who are so driven to power level.  They just won't know how much fun they're missing.  I personally could care less if I ever get to 50 (I'm lvl 17 now)... this game is just too much fun to be concerned with that.<P>The desire to obtain all the top-end items is also self-destructive.  I STILL haven't obtained a flowing black robe or stein of moggok, and guess what?!  I'm still doing fine.  Could I lvl faster if I had all the stuff?  Probably, but Who Cares?!  If I'm lvl 17 or lvl 47, I'll STILL be fighting beasties that are too tough, and having to group with friends that are great to be around, etc.  Won't be any different than it is now... so why go nuts about leveling?<P>OK, on with the flames!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>i agreew with the above response,i don't really care if i hit lvl 50 anytime soon.by the way i am lvl 9,i took up tailoring as my trade skill and it is very cool.i enjoy helping the newbies out with some patchwork etc.that is why i play alot of the time is to help out new people and to group with good people and go kill things.at first i thought it was all about power lvling,but as stated in the above response it got old for me to quick.that is why i took up tailoring,i still fight but only to lvl so that i may get things i need for my skill or because i want to do a quest that is what it is all about for me</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Apperently you did not pay much attention to my post ... i did do trade skills , A LOT of trade skills ... i mastered 6 of them , as well as almost 20 languages and meny meny quests (as well as master level fishing and a lot of other 'useless' skills) ...<P>The point i was makeing is in the time i did this my class has been made weaker , my spells have been made weaker , the mobs ill have to fight to go up have been buffed , the top end items have been nerfed and/or their drop rate nerfed ... verents solution for everything is to nerf it ... thats not good enugh for me , if thay cant come up with a more imaginitive and creative solution than nerfing any problem that comes allong then i dont want any part of it.<P>This patern of nerfing has been developing since the very begining of the game , and shows no sign of changeing  ... in the end it is not about trade skills or level or class/spell power , its about fair play.<P>I dont like being punished with tougher mobs / nerfed drops becaus their are more top end players than verant planed on ... nor do i like being subjected to tons of lag becaus thay would rather wait to see the impact of the new zoned on crowding instead of splitting more servers now ... further more i think it stinks that some trade skill things have been broke since the game went public yet some things that worked fine (like rubicite) are replaced (with quest armor for most but not all) becaus too meny people find them usefull ... and it down right pisses me off that verants only solution time and time again is to nurf , Nurf , NURF.<P>If you dont see this happeneing then have fun and dont worrie about me ... if you do see this then you can do like i did and try to offer sugestions / options / ideas other than calling for a nerf every time something dose no go as planned ... but for me , im done waisting my time on this game , their are bigger better things in my life and my time is worth more to me than sitting on my but for 14 hours straight just to find out the drop was nerfed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ummmm...<P>Ok, you need to re-read my post as well..<P>To condense my arguement:<P>Have fun.  Don't worry about leveling or material possessions.<P>To continue my arguement:<BR>Don't worry if your character is nerfed.  Who cares if you no longer can get a mana stone or rubicite armor, or whatever.  Just enjoy the game.  Find friends online.  Enjoy their company.<P>One other note - since your arguement has moved AWAY from Trade Skills (note MSG BOARD heading), perhaps you should air your views on the gameplay msg board instead.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>well ... now that i have quit evernerf i am haveing fun , something i was finding harder and harder to you in EQ ... with real life friends , at real life 'events' , doing real life things ...<P>But at the risk of repeating myself its not about things or levels ... my grip was about fair play and handleing something in a more creative way than nerfing it ... something i have said meny times on the gameplay board (when i still played) ...<P>Finly my warning still stands ... you can come back and do trade skills any time (unless thay get nerfed that is) but ... it will only get harder to gain levels and top end items as time gose on ... soooo , i sugest you get your levels in now and waist (thats right , waist) your time on trade skills later.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is not a flame, so please don't take it as one.<P>Why are you even writing on this msg board?  If you've quit the game and have moved on, why did you come here and start this msg thread?<P>I see this a lot... "I quit EQ and here's why..."  Why post on these msg boards?  Why?  Same question for those who have moved onto other games, like AC... why spend your time coming back to a msg board for a game you've left?  Is it to warn us, or just to get your anger out (who know where it comes from...it is just a GAME after all...)?<P>I just don't get it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I kind of wonder what the point to this whole board was, too.. =)<BR>I got tired of leveling back in the MUD days, I mean after you hit 50th level 4 times in about 2 or 3 MUDS alone, you start wanting to do something else with your gaming life. It really just sounds like you weren't sure what you really wanted. Maybe if you had mixed your leveling with your trade skills you could have ended up at 50th with your friend and then relaxed with a good trade skill?<BR> I'm the opposite, actually, wanting to be a Master Smith, then maybe I'll wander out and kill some more stuff. Like Renalor said, you have fun with your friends and just enjoy playing the game. However nobody forces anyone to be a trade master nor be 50th level. If you quit EQ because you felt like your class was "nerfed" while you were practicing your trade skills, what kept you from stopping your trade skills and going out there to get some stuff before you were totally "frisbeed"? Or does Nerf make footballs?.. air guns?.. <BR> And I think we can all recall the main phrase of this and any other RPG.. "IT'S JUST A GAME!!"... =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001004&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001004&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
