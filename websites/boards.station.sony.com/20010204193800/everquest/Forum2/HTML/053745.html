This may include a nerf or two, I want to warn you of that. I am just as willing to suggest a negative change that helps to achieve balance as a positive one.<P>Also, I understand that a bard is a complicated class to play. And I have no problem with that. This complicated nature will always mean that there are fewer bards in the game than other classes. I'm fine with that too.<P>Please, be detailed where you need to.

</FONT><HR>"I hate downtime twisting. It doesn't show skill, it shows preserverance, boredom and sore hands. On the other hand, twisting during battle is necessary and showcases skill."- selenia<P>Great Point! So how about compromising with songs, like make aria of eagles also have selo's speed and cantana be as good as hymm and jig and clarity but not stack with them.  even hymm or even aquatic ayre having jig effect but not stacking with it.  I too would enjoy shooting off a quick tell or going for a new pop or doing anything without having to announce to the group that I'm not twisting during downtime due to chat or whatever.<P>Well, doesn't sound like class balance but it sure does take away from the carpel tunnel aspect of the class without affecting game balance either way.<P>I think bard seems very balanced on paper but in reality it is a very weak class, especially from 50 to 60.  I see a lack of posts here for actual class balancing issues that don't fall under the catagory of either bugs or things you wish for and don't expect to get, but then again so many of the bugs that plague the class (song ends, song starts, song ends comes to mind) have been around for so long that everyone belives fixing these alone will make the class balanced with others.<P>Do you think he'll read all this by the time it gets to Bard Talk (Part Eight)?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Has anybody taken a good look at our lev 50+ songs?<P>-Information gleaned from EQ castersrealm-<P>lev 51 selo's travel:  great convenience song for getting from point A to point B.  Not group friendly per se, due to the lag/ld risk, etc.<P>lev 51 absonant binding:  weak slow debuff (30-35%) and weak snare rolled into one.<P>lev 52 nillipus' march of the wee:  10ac +18agi and a damage absorbtion.  Get smacked by anything over lev 20 and the whole effect is gone, and the effect is totally weak to begin with, come on look at the level of the song and the amount of buff here!<P>lev 53 song of twilight:  this is a great song!  no complaints here.<P>lev 53 song of dawn:  lowers aggro...I actually never have a problem with aggro and I twist and/or mez like crazy.  I also have a symphonic saber so this song is moot to me.  Didn't bother scribing it.<P>lev 54 celerity:  45% haste with no stat buffs or stamina regen.  Worthless if there is an enchanter in the group.<P>lev 54 selo's assonait strait:  AE version of lev 51 song, but much weaker (23-25% slow debuff and a weaker snare).  I don't think I even bothered buying this one.  If you have more than one mob in melee range and it isnt mezzed, somebody is gonna get spanked with or without this song going.<P>lev 55 cantana of replenishment:  great song, I am looking forward to this one.<P>lev 55 brusco's bombastic bellow: 222hp DD 8 sec stun usable every 5 min. I have no feedback on this song.<P>lev 55 occlusion of sound:  42hp DD and a stun/pushback.  I have no feedback on this song.<P>lev 56 song of highsun:  stun/cancel magic/gate mob to spawn point without clearing aggro?  Who came up with that idea?  Sounds like a train bringer to me.  I can only imagine how hard it is to even stick on a mob with all those effects to it, like you would even want it to stick at all.<P>lev 56 song of midnight:  improved AE fear? huh?<P>lev 57 mcvaxius' rousing rondo:  21-22% haste, some str, and 13-14 attack (which is from the str increase of course), and 8pt DS.  The haste is a waste with an enchanter and is much slower than the previous 2 haste songs, so essentially you get some str and an 8pt DS, which over the fight will probably do 3 seconds worth of the groups' melee damage output over the course of a fight, if that.  The lev 50 song Verses of victory is a much more productive song.<P>lev 57 cassindra's insepid ditty:  decrease mana by 15 and int and wis by 15.  We all know about the huge mana pools and insane mana regen rates of NPC casters.  Sounds like trying to empty a swimming pool with a spoon.<P>lev 58 nivs harmonic:  increase ac by 24.  Doesn't sound too bad, but a little too weak for the level.<P>lev 58 jonathan's inspiration:  self only 31-33% haste, +17-18 str, increase attack by 16-17 (from the str bonus).  WHY, WHY, WHY is this song even in existence??!!  Verses of Victory from lev 50 is soooo much better than this.<P>lev 59 denon's bereavement:  AE 30hp DD that saves against poison and lowers MR by 15.  Did that say AE DD? I thought so  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> , well maybe it might help to soften up some mobs before the chanter can mez them.  Might be semi-useful that way, as long as the mobs have a weak save versus poison.<P>lev 59 charisma:  increases charisma by 45.  Could be useful with charm/mez.<P>lev 60 Kazumi's Note of Preservation:  group divine aura.  This sounds like a great song in the right time and place.<P>lev 60 Angstlich's Assonance: weak slow (31%), weak DOT (250hp).  Lasts 1 minute though...<P>lev 60 Composition of Ervaj:  350 mana drain usable every 12 seconds.  Now we are trying to empty that swimming pool full of mana with a bucket rather than a spoon.  I can imagine that the resist rate for this song is rather high as well.<P>All of the other classes gain melee disciplines or more powerful spells and the mobs get alot stronger as they get higher in level don't they?  CORRECT<P>Bards get more powerful as they get higher in level and get higher level songs don't they?  WRONG<P>Bards continue to be mana/hp regen batteries with the addition of limited crowd control.  Oh, and a couple of gimmick songs that might be helpful, but come at such high levels that they just don't outweigh the huge power vacuum happening in the Bard song repetoire post 50.<P>LHEP!<P>Gundre Dyermaker<BR>54 Minstrel<BR>Destiny<BR>SolRo<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There were many wonderful posts in part 2, but I unfortunately noticed a lot of unfounded complaints as well.<P>As stated many times, the biggest problem with balancing bards once and for all lies in the fact that we're not understood well.  We have eleven haste songs and yet we're third-rate at best at providing it.  Our class-only armor, though we're a plate class (whatever that means anymore), is often given chain AC ratings by the developers.  <P>Still, to those who say we "suck", think again.  If you feel you cannot bring more than a battery to a group, then start learning your potential.  We're wonderful crowd controllers thanks to a combination of excellent pulling ability, mesmerize and charm.  We lower overall downtime significantly through various means, such as debuffing, clarity, damage shields, use of charm, etc.  Be creative.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>And you know Absor, although we do have a few legitimate balance issues with items such as haste stacking (and why those with epics are the only ones able to take advantage of the Ervaj line, that's just dumb), I think we're a lot more concerned with making sure that Verant acknowledges we exist.  We realize they'll never understand us, but sometimes it feels like they're only trying to balance 13 classes.  The effects a change to a spell might have on one of our songs NEEDS to be considered.  Heck, why do you think we're so organized as to our needs?<P>Thanks again for reading Absor...<P>-FF, 60 bard, Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>quoted from Absor:<BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR>&gt;"- The boots summon 1 water at a time with a 5 second cast time. PLEASE change this to summon 10 or 20 at a time so it's at least useful. As it is, I just buy my water in bulk instead of taking 2 minutes to summon a stack of water that'll all disappear every time I go linkdead. - The greaves summon 1 food at a time. See boots above."&lt; <P>Welcome to the world of magicians… <P>Here I find it very easy to argue that not all items are supposed to be super useful. These two can save you a trip to town and allow you to put it off until a more convenient time. It's certainly not the most awesome effect in game, but that's not really a good argument. <BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR>There's a difference between being useful and being used. Summoning water with my boots means I'm spending 5 seconds when I could be healing the party, claritying the part, etc. If I summon a full stack of water, that's 60 full seconds that i could have used to do a whole lot for my party. The fact of the matter is I don't ever use my boots. (most bards I know don't) I still buy food and water in town because it means I'm not wasting the parties' time.<P>I'm not going to argue that this change is necessary, but it is one of convenience. I don't see how summoning 5 or 10 or 20 at a time would imbalance anything. It's not like food and drink have any effect on how fast you kill a mob. This creates extra down time, when it should reduce down time by making our trips into town fewer and further between.<P><BR>quoted from Absor:<BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR>&gt;"At high levels, that margin simply doesn't exist. The 10% haste on the level 60 song doesn't come anywhere close to giving us the 45% haste advantage that's needed to keep us in line with the other melee classes."&lt; <P>One of us is making a logical error here... Bardic hastes are not, primarily, designed to make the bard into damage dealer comparable to a warrior. That's not the intent. The intent is that the bards can improve the melee ability of his entire group by that amount. Keep in mind, bards were designed from the ground up to be a party based class. <BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR>I don't mean to be confrontational, but I think the error is on your part. We don't want our haste to bring us in line with warrior damage. Look at it this way...<P>The stackable haste songs require an instrument to be played, eliminating the bard's ability to deal melee damage. In order for the Eravj songs to be useful in any capacity, they must recoup the loss of the bard's melee ability and then some, otherwise, it's more efficient for the bard to keep on using his weapons.<P>As it stands, adding an additional 5% haste to the entire party doesn't even come close to the damage that a bard can deal out if he continues to use his weapons, that's why we feel the percentage is too low.<P>quoted from Absor:<BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR>&gt;"Dirge (level 43 song). Mana cost is 800. Bards don't benefit from any form of mana regen, so 800 mana takes 40 minutes to regenerate sitting, 80 minutes to regenerate standing. The song does about 311-340 points AE damage to a maximum of 4 targets. Could you please reappraise the mana cost on this song? We can't meditate so if you factor in sitting mana regen time, this song does best-case (4 targets) 0.6 dam/sec."&lt; <P>But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana, with the exception of the use of this song. So I don't see this as a big problem. All it does is determine how many times you can use the Dirge in any given time period. Unlike other casters, it does nothing to prevent you from using all of your other songs. <BR>--------------------------------------------------<P>Our levle 39 charm song requires mana each time it pulses. This was implemented to limit the amount of charming a bard could do. Using Dirge drastically impacts our ability to charm. Furthermore, is 300 hp of damage so powerful that it warrants only being useable every 40-80 minutes? This is probably the worst mana to damage ratio in the game. I can do more damage using hand to hand in 4 minutes than I can with this song in 40. Also, if you agree that the recast time (5 min) on the 55 song (Brusco's Bombastic Bellow) is too long when that song only does 200 damage, then how can you not also agree that the recast on Desperate dirge (40 min) is too long?<P>Lastly, you mentioned that you would be looking at the Lute of the Howler. Can you explain what about the lute makes it imbalancing? Bards (along with rogues) already recieve some illusions via items (mask of deception, mask of obtenbration, iksar hide mask) how do these differ from the lute's illusion?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You need to look carefully at the list of post-50 songs above and the comments on them.  Compare these to the list of spells given to other classes, and the increase in power and decrease in cost that comes with those.<P>My comments:<P>lev 49 shield of song:  Niv's (47) is better overall and they don't stack.<P>lev 51 selo's travel:  all travel songs need a MUCH larger radius to be useful.  Songs with invis should NOT cancel if the buff is still up and the song gets resung.<P>lev 51 absonant binding:  This NEEDS a fixed duration.<P>lev 53 song of dawn:  My aggro problem is not with the primary targets, it's with all the secondary targets.  And it's pretty pointless to lower myself on an aggro list when I'm the only one on it, not to mention that this is single-target.  If anything, this should be AE and not break mez, or even better, it should be a TAUNT song.<P>lev 54 celerity:  Haste is much too slow for this level, doesn't stack.<P>lev 55 brusco's bombastic bellow:  Ridiculous recycle time considering the relatively feeble DD and the OK but not unbalancing stun.<P>lev 56 song of highsun:  and<BR>lev 56 song of midnight:  The idea of having a song only work for 12 hours a day is cute, but makes these songs really undesirable.  There are NO biorhythmic or, in many place, visual cues to suggest that the song isn't good anymore.  Occupying one of 8 slots with a song that is useful less than half the time implies that the song should be VERY good, and these are not.  We lose too much utility memming songs in and out to waste the time.  Make them 24-hour-a-day songs, they actually seem level appropriate without the 12-hour limitation.<P>57 mcvaxius' rousing rondo:  Level 50 VoV is better.<P>lev 57 cassindra's insepid ditty:  If you could land this on a caster before he uses any of his mana bank, I suppose this could be marginally useful (if it knocks down his mana pool for the duration of the fight by the appropriate amount).  Whether that's enough to fill up one of eight song slots I doubt.  At level 57? <P>lev 58 nivs harmonic:  At level 58?<P>lev 59 charisma:  I suppose I could use this with charm, if I didn't have to spend my time charming.  And if most of the MOBs I ran into at this level weren't above the level cap.  What's the point of this song?<P>Currently, the only songs that I consider well-balanced compared to the other classes' increase in strength are Twilight and Cantata.  Twilight has enough drawbacks to make it nowhere near as good as Enchanter mez, but still very useful.  Cantata is a great song, perhaps too great, but given all of the other stuff, I'm not going to complain about it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A suggestion for making Bards more useful in the 50+ game<BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR>I apologize if the following has already been covered.  I've skimmed the thread and did not see it.  I'm also a first time reader/poster, but a long time player with multiple high level chars.  So...<P>THE IDEA:<BR>My suggestion is a new song that would give bards something more useful to do both on big raids and in average grouping situations.  Why not a song that adds a very small damage proc to the weapons of all group members?  Something we'd get around lvl 50, that does around 15pts of damage (perhaps scaling up a bit with level) and stacks with any existing dmg procs built into the weapons.<P>THE REASON:<BR>In the post 50 game, Bards still have some good defensive buffs, healing, mana regen and even mezz, but are severely lacking on the offensive side.  As a class seemingly designed to be able to fill what ever niche is needed at the time, we need a boost on the offensive side.  A dmg proc song gives us that.  Here are two examples of my most common grouping situations and how this song gives me a nice niche to fill, making me a desirable addition to a party:<P>A)Typical Dungeon Group: I'm almost always grouped with a couple of melee classes and at least 2 of the following - Druid, Shaman, Cleric, Enchanter.  As has been argued here over and over, those classes greatly reduce the benefits of our staple songs in the 50+ game.  The proc song, coupled with dmg shield and a third buff of our choosing would allow us to fill the offense niche nicely, making it easier for us to get groups.<P>C)Big Raid Mobs: Without fail, I'm placed in a primary melee group with the sole purpose of singing a resist song.  That's not so bad to me really, except that in the 50+ game a lot of the people I play with have EXCELLENT resists without a bard's help, diminishing my usefulness.  But what if I could boost their resists AND add to their offense with a little extra proc'ing action?  I think that would make me more attractive to the raid organizers, who always want more dmg over time.<P>So there ya go, one song that fills a niche we're lacking in and shouldn't be unbalancing (but still useful)if the dmg isn't set too high.<P>Thanks for reading,<P>Thistlenote</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Personally I agree with what most people have said about what a bard should get in order to balance the class. I guess it would have been easier to just make them like other hybrids and design them with the fighting skills of a rogue and the magic skills of an enchanter. That way you would not have to try to work so hard to try to balance such a complex class as ours. But that is hind sight. Personally I feel that bards should be given an increase in defense if we are more defensive in and an increase in damage as far as are songs go. Just because we rarely use mana does not mean that our songs should be weaker than every other casters spells. If that is the case I would rather have the ability to cast spells with mana then just so my powers would be on par with everyone else. Being one who plays AD&D I noticed that bards have the fighting ability and hps of a rogue but the casting ability of a lower lvl spell caster. Now I am not saying that we should be given all of the skills of a rogue but at least allow us some of the defensive abilities like evade. Are songs are such a taunt because we do so much for a group that the mobs take it very personal and attempt to and most of the time succeed in making us pay for it. As for backstab I do not see that skill as much as bard skill just rogue only but I do wish that you would bring parry and riposte brought down to the lvls that other hybrid classes gain there defensive abilities. At the lvl they are now not many will get the chance to use them and at their current setting they rarely work. All in all I would just like to say that I really do enjoy my class though I am not as high as most and I really am awaiting the chance to see how much better we can truly be in the long run. Again thank you for these talks and good hunting always. :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Just look at the scale power of our songs vs the monsters increase power or other classes power increase.<BR>Aledark&gt;&gt;<BR>Either make it equal to shamans/enchanters, or make it stack. It's that simple. No one wants a Bard's haste when an enchanter is in the group (99% of the time) because it sucks.

</FONT><HR>Absor - A couple of comments after looking at the Enchanter thread:<P>Illusions can't be removed except by:  a) waiting them out, b) casting dispell on yourself (which may remove other buffs) or c) zoning.  I would really HATE it if you caused illusions to continue from zone-to-zone unless you added the ability to remove the illusion by clicking on it.<P>Some of our songs (Cantata, 55, for example) stack with spells (Clarity and Clarity 2 in this case), but they have to be applied in the correct order.  The spell has to be applied, then the song can be sung.  We have to stop the song in order for the spell buff to be applied if we are already singing it.<P>It would be nice if we didn't have to do this, but please be VERY careful if you do.  I would hate to have you make it so that the Enchanter spell can be cast while the song is active by overwriting the song, and having the song have no effect unless we stop and start it again.  That would be worse than the current case.  I never play with spells on, I'd have no clue when I should do this.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I admit I am not much of a message board hound, but I have been reading these threads as I was directed to these threads by a friend.<P>The issues of class balance really became a bone of contention with the expansions of Kunark and Velious and the ability to surpass level 50. The disparity between players and NPCs has caused an imbalance between classes in attempting to address the high level game. Just reading the subject headings is indication enough that the player base as well as Verant are striving for an acceptable measure of class balance.<P>There really aren't any new ideas I can bring to the discussion. But what I can do is respond to Absor as is customary for progressive discussions. He has taken the time and effort to respond to our thoughts and ideas. This gives me an indication of his thoughts and ideas in regards to bards and it would be civil to at least discuss his own ideas with him.<P><BR>1.<BR>The first statement I will address is in regards to haste threads. In it Absor gives us an idea of what Verant feels is part of the class balance issue for bards.<P>---<BR>One of us is making a logical error here... Bardic hastes are not, primarily, designed to make the bard into damage dealer comparable to a warrior. That's not the intent. The intent is that the bards can improve the melee ability of his entire group by that amount. Keep in mind, bards were designed from the ground up to be a party based class.<BR>---<P>Bards were designed from the ground up to be a party based class. That means our songs must benefit the party. However, once our songs no longer benefit the party then we cease to be the party based class as indicated above. Our songs must be stackable with buffs, hastes, slows, and debuffs. I am not suggesting anything so ridiculous as Selo's stacking with SoW, and I am sure it is easy to understand what I mean from this statement. If our songs fight with other spells or do not work at all with other spells (be it party or NPC) that is one aspect of class balance, as interpreted from Absor's statement that must be addressed.<P><BR>2.<BR>The second issue I want to discuss with Absor is in regards to his response regarding the usefullness of bard songs. In it Absor also gives an indication as to what is class balance for bards by defining their uniqueness.<P>---<BR>And he may have been right. But also, keep in mind that most bard songs remain useful for the life of the bard. This is completely unique to the class, and requires a completely different scheme of increasing power.<BR>---<P>This has been pointed out by many that our songs are not useful for the life of the bard. Glaring examples are Lullaby and the level 39 charm. There are others, but I don't think I need to list them as so many have done so already. These songs may have been useful at lower levels but their usefullness is nonexistence in the high level game. The ever increasing amount of missed notes, the insane resistances of NPCs, the finite limit and duration of song effects, and the ever vigilant nature of playing a bard reaffirm that many songs are not useful for the life of the bard. Just because exceptions can be found to make the song useful does not invalidate the claim that songs lose their usefulness. Doing so dictates that a bard's life must be experienced through exceptions which is definitely an imbalance for the class.<P><BR>3.<BR>The third comment I would like to discuss is Absor's response in regards to mana usage where he makes very real overtones that mana useage is part of the class balance equation for bards.<P>---<BR>But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana, with the exception of the use of this song. So I don't see this as a big problem. All it does is determine how many times you can use the Dirge in any given time period. Unlike other casters, it does nothing to prevent you from using all of your other songs.<BR>---<P>Our level 39 charm definitely usesd mana and it definitely does prevent us from using this song after Dirge has been sung. I do not feel mana should be part of bard's songs, but I am not here to discuss my stance on the issue, but rather to discuss Absor's stance on the issue and why the mana useage is imbalanced. I have already alluded to one song that cannot be sung after Dirge and contradicts your statement "it does nothing to prevent you from using all of your other songs." I have a very real fear that mana may be assigned to other songs and thus also be affected by Dirge. This is entirely within the realm of possibility because our level 39 charm that used to be manaless has since been made mana dependent.<P>What I propose, then, for the issue of class balance in regards to mana is based on what some others have suggested. Our mana dependent songs affect NPCs. We can Dirge ourselves, but we cannot dirge others and we can not charm others (duels and arena aside). We have a song that allows us to steal mana from NPCs and songs that allow us to give mana to others. Since our use of mana is basically against NPCs an ability to regen mana can come from NPCs. Our mana song gives mana to others from an unlimited source and I do not feel there needs to be an issue in regards to how mana that is stolen is to be divided into the group. Stealing mana from NPCs and transfering it to our groupmates would go in the right direction to the mana issue of class balance.<P><BR>4.<BR>This last topic is in regards to female bard animations. Absor did have an off-the-cuff remark that I certainly hope is not followed through.<P>---<BR>But aren't bards supposed to look silly?<BR>---<P>I most definitely am not supposed to look silly. I love that I play with dignity and poise and not dance around like a jester. Not all bards are fools and those that think otherwise have a very limited source of literature. Please allow me to retain my dignity and do not denigrate me to the realm of looking silly.<P><BR>5.<BR>To end this response I will refer to one last quote:<P>---<BR>Ok, that's my first pass on bards. It may be a while before I post here again, but I will be reading and adding new suggestions to the list. So keep posting good ideas.<BR>---<P>I definitely posted this with the intention of continuing discussion and not issuing for disputes. I felt your post provided insight as to where you are coming from just as our posts have been giving you insight. I hope everyone can appreciate the avenue of discussion I chose to use.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don’t have much to add because a lot of the problems are at higher levels and I’m not there yet.  But here are a few things that I’ve found even at my level (14).<P>1) Meditation of 1 is WAY too low.  Please allow something so that we can memorize our songs faster.  It doesn’t have to be a lot.  Maybe a couple of skill points every couple of levels.  We wouldn’t be rivaling casters, but it would help us a lot.<P>2) Lack of low-level instruments.  It is really disappointing to see that my next drum and stringed instrument comes from MM, which isn't feasible for many levels.  I'd like to see more of these.<P>3) Difficulty in raising offensive and defensive skills.  Right now, they are pretty good because I work solo a lot.  But later, when I will be working more on my instrument skills, I worry about my offense and defense.  This isn't really a top priority, just something to think about.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have a few quick to the point requests that I think would really be important to the game:<BR>1. Spells cast on mobs should last longer than a simple 6seconds if that.  If I can convince an animal to join me in my attmepts at slaying other creatures, surely in 6 seconds I dont have to remind him. Every other class that can charm has the ability to fight and or cast with their fight.  Bards for the most part can charm, make sure they can run away if it doesnt work, and charm again. We never get any time to melee or cast songs on our target.  The problem with Mez is the same thing.  Even if these songs worked closer to 30 seconds it would be worth it.<BR>2. More nice NO DROP items.  One of the worst thing anyone can do is to start up an account for the first time and make a bard, because the economy is so out of wack with all the twinks. Something more along the lines of Sleeves of the Anchients- something thats not overpowering, but can be obtained through lots of effort.  Also perhaps having most of our items drop in non-dark controlled areas would help just a wee bit on the zek servers ;(   <BR>3. More like the Rogue class. Originally in roleplay the rogue class consists of thieves and bards. Keep backstab to the rogues, and of course their pickpocketing and all that, but how about a higher lockpicking skill? with the lack of locks all over the land it is hardly an overpowering trait to hand over to bards. I would even say if you were to do this to make the level maybe 45-even 50 instead of the now 40 to make this more of a class balance.  <BR>4. As talking above- we have hide, we have sneak, we need them to work together like a rogue. Why? Well our bretheren Rogue's and us both have a mean streak against undead, and we also are pretty much loners. Our invisibility song is a joke. we need an instrument and if we get a lag spike or whatever we go out.  Make us walk like we have ensnare on us if you have to, but our class needs a better invis.<BR>5. Weapons. I have no complaints here!  The newer kunark and velious bard usable weapons are fantastic and fun to play with. I do wish we had some that could do something we cant (like cast root or clinging darkness)<BR>6. songs. I'm sure you have heard all you want but for the most part (and there are too many instances for me to go into) so many of our songs are a joke. I wait until level 37 to get a dmg shield of 6.  My dd at level 40 is less than a level 8 any caster.  Our songs are less than the real thing plus the do not stick. It should really be the other way around if you think about it. Heck our group cancel magic doesnt work 90% of the time, and neither do our cancel poison or disease.  We need more ways than buying potions to protect ourselves if you were planning for us to have this ability. If not, i believe the expression is "Dont take off the clothes.." I'm sure you know the rest.<BR>7. Last- why not have more bard mobs? I'm assuming its because bards cant really kill anything? That they are usless in groups? You are telling us how great bards can be, but I remember seeing a nasty giant in OOT for my epic quest, but almost nothing else. Everything is a druid or necro or wizard or warrior. I would even go as far as to say a Vox equal as a bard.   <BR>As far as most things happen I look at bards like this- They are a cross between a rogue and enchanter.  We need some of each part, and obviously not all of one either.  It is obvious that we are a low priority, and before you get defensive, think about how quick the servers would be down for an emergency patch if SOW didnt work.  We had to wait over a week for our song to actually work like it should and that takes too long.<P>Aternal Virtuoso<P>Thank you for your time in reading all these posts Absor.  We hope you can make us a class that is fun to play again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alright Absor...<P>I've read most of all the pages thusfar, and I think we both can see reacurring themes.  That said, I urge you to listen to Norbard, Thott, Solos, and Kae's analysis from the Concert hall.  We -do- know what we're talking about, and even if you do continue to find small holes in how an argument is presented, that doesn't mean that the problem detailed doesn't exist, it only means that the argument could use refinement.<P>My personal issues about bards sortof parallel their previous work.  Let me tell you, it IS annoying sitting in a group with an enchanter/shaman, and really having to wrack my brains to find effects from my repetoir that will enhance group effectiveness.  Part of the problem is bard song stacking among other songs, but haste and slow stacking with similar spell effects would really help our groupability, and bards are absolutely supposed to be a group oriented class. <P>I don't see how helping our group reach the haste cap faster is unbalanceing.  The game was played for a very long time at the haste cap and was still hard.  Not all people have super haste items.  Making them stack would increase our effectiveness while in a group, while not decreasing the effectiveness of the shaman/enchanter.  Same with slows.  <P>One thing you need to keep in mind at all times with bards is that we don't function like other classes.  We HAVE to be in a group for our effects to be felt, we can ONLY sing 3 at a time, and we must constantly refresh these three.  We can't buff 20 people in other parties.  We are already limited by number of effects, how they stack, and our effects being GROUP only.  <P>Group composition also effects what we sing.  For instance, if I'm with tanks I will sing tank songs - Nivs, Verses of Victory, Largo's melodic binding, Selo's chords of cessation, things like that to help the tanks fight faster, swing harder, boost their healing/attk, and punish the mob's ac, or slowing it depending on who's around me.<P>With basically all casters, its manasong and chants.  Boost caster mana, lower monster resists. <BR>Snare if need be, but that rarely works since previously it just canceled root which is more relaible than my snare, or my snare still can break before I'm done resinging it.  <P>Which brings me to my little tiff about our snare.  We have to constantly recast this thing to make it work, its range isn't the greatest, and its resistance rate is pretty high...why does it also have no reliable effect time??  I know bards have to pay for no-mana effects, and believe me we DO pay for it our entire lives, but do we have to have every single disadvantage rolled up into one song?? When do the disads outweigh the ads??  Probably not in snare for a while, since it is the only effect of its kind we get from 23-51 so its <BR>low range, high resistance, short effect time, AND unreliable effect time (best case is what 12 seconds??  Level 1 druid snare lasts how many times that??)<P>Before you take me to task saying druids are the best at snareing and shouldn't try to be...I'm not saying that.  What I am saying is that I KNOW bards are the worst of the classes in several areas and I'm not trying to become the best.  What I want to know though, is why does the gap between the worst at something and the next worst have to be so large??  Especially compareing that next worst and the best, you'll find that gap is a lot smaller.<P>Just compare Bard snare level 23 with druid snare level 1, or its upgrade ensnare...and compare it wth the darkness line while you're at it, with its many upgrades.  I think you'll find that the differences between bards and necro/druid effects are far far larger on the side of bard disads than either the necros or druids differ with respect to power.<P>Bards are also the worse hybrid/melee/plate person whatever you classify us as in melee.  You know what, I don't want to be the best.  But do I have to be the worst by such a large margin??  Compareing the SK/Paladin/Ranger defensive skills with ours, someone further up already did that numerically.  We wait longer to get lower capped defensive skills.  A LOT longer...normal hybrids get parry at what 30?? bards get it at 53, and it caps much much lower anyway.  <P>Solos said it well when she said that bards don't wear plate to do damage, we wear plate because we get hit. A LOT.  A REALLY REALLY LARGE AMOUNT ABSOR.<P>Its our songs.  Every unengaged monster pulled will target the bard first.  Try it in a plane sometime.  While the monk pulls 4 monsters, the main assist grabs one and everybody follows it...the enchanters sort out the rest for mesmerizeation and while they are doing this, those mobs hit ME.  Especially when there's only one bard up in the plane (we're rare remember??)<P>This is why we need better defensive skills.  Even though verant over time did tune down our hate from songs a little (6way constant helping spells really really used to piss off monsters worse than now, and even now it's pretty horrifying) I will bet you that anytime there's a train in a plane the bards will go down first.  The only exception would be someone doing big AEs, but since I play on PvP you don't really do that in raids lest you kill your own raid team.<P>Alright, we agree that the more combat oriented hybrids (pally,sk,hell probably even ranger) should have -better- skills than we do and get them earlier, but does the gap have to be so large??  Our dodge cap should be closer to rogues (we dance damn it) and our parry/ripost cap should at least be 140-150 IMO.  After all, a level 50+ bard should have the melee skills of a level 30 something on defense shouldn't they?? better than a level 14 cap of 75!! <P>I also believe that some of our other caps should be raised to reflect that fact that this game is NO LONGER scaled for level 50.  Sneak and hide could use a small bump.  Sneak's at 75, again does jack of all trades = level 14 character??  Hide...bard hide is a joke, I'm a wood elf so I get a better cap by race than by class.  Instill doubt...can probably be where it is but a raise to 100 may not hurt...we still have to make the attack role after all and our offense sucks as intended and should remain last place.<P>What really gets my goose though, is pick locks.  We have had this skill since release, we get it at level 40 and you know what, we can go to Befallen. Thats what every level 40 wants to do.  Then kunark comes out and pick locks has a use...just not for us.  Make no mistake I am glad it has a use in game and rogues absolutely should be the big cheese in pick locks.  But does that also mean that bards have to be useless with it?? I support the man who was saying raise our cap to 200/201 and make some doors 202+.  Rogues then can do more than bards can ever hope to with pick locks (as they should) yet bards can make a contribution some of the time.  Thats jack of all trades master of none right there...USEFUL but not PERFECT.  <P>That phrase is also why I want to see some of the bards caps raised on our support skills.  I really think that a level 14 character level of skill in something doesn't really constitute useful.  In the level 50 game, it wasn't quite as obvious because pick locks did nothing for anybody really,  we didn't have parry or riposte at all though we needed something to keep from dying constantly.<P>Now we have a game balanced for levels 1-60, and level 14 skills on a level 50+ character just is laughable to the point of ineffectual.  Hide I never use.  Ditto on forage, except to forage up an item to keep my body from disappearing if I die and await res.  Safe fall is capped at 40, I would personally raise it a little because bards are faster now and the terrain is more jagged than in Antonica.  Sneak has no use except to wander invisible behind something and sneak to get the quest or bank or sell.  Parry and Disarm...need to be higher capped if you expect us to survive being beaten up by the higher monsters.  Getting it earlier wouldn't hurt either, but we lived in the level 50 game without it (badly beaten, but we did).  I'd put parry at 51 and riposte at 55 or 56, and make the caps 140 or 150 if it was left to me.  I'll take last place in hybrid melee combat, but I just don't want the margin to be as (I would say absurdly) large as it is now.<P>My basic belief about bard songs and effects that need balance, if I had to generalize, is that our power did not increase substantially in the post 50 game relative to the increases in other classes.  <P>Our pre-kunark songs were simply not scaled for life after 50, yet we never get identical upgrades like other casters so we still have to use them.  Thats a net decrease in our effectiveness after 50 because the game got harder and our effects did not change their scale.<P>Thats probably why our resists, perfectly useful songs that can really make a difference in raids before kunark, now are basically a waste of time.  Monsters got more powerful.  Our abilities did not change.  It's a problem of the scaleing of our song's effects that doesn't take into account life after 50, and should for appropriate balance.<P>Most of our kunark songs were broken in one way or several upon release, and are for the most part new effects or new combinations of effects that add something new that we can use, but do not replace previous effects.  I would also venture that our kunark effects are not significantly more powerful than pre kunark effects, only possibly more diverse or different.  Thats not necessarily keeping with the increased power curve of a game that is scaled for level 60 play.<P>Velious songs, well I haven't had a chance to deal with them much because they drop now instead of being bought and I don't have them all.  But I can tell you from the level 34 song that it really sucks.  I can do better using the three songs that make up that effect during downtime, and the fact that it is lute required makes it only twistable really in certain circumstances.  We didn't need it, I don't know why we got it, it seems more of a step in the direction of manabattery.  Thumbs down.<P>And...our level 55 song needs help.  our level 32 manasong stacked with everything because it was built differently.  I STRONGLY urge you to redesign the 55 song so that its effects work as pulses rather than icons.  This is because of stacking.  Enchanters can't cast c2 while this song is up and I would bet that the healing component makes a mess of regen spells, probably without showing it as is common among bard songs. <BR>I would also personally adjust our dirge to be a stun effect so one can desperately dirge, then run like the wind.  It's so useless that I basically only use it as a joke, and I can tell you right now it's just not worth keeping in memory for a timer.  I have to redesign my playlist everytime I change group members, all bards at least have to look at their effects when their party changes because we enhance the party, depending on what IT is.  We don't often have one role that we stick with like say, a wizard who's role is rather tightly defined by their abilities.<P>But I have to reiterate that our single biggest balance problem is that while the game progressed beyond level 50, our effects did not.  This is KEY because we do not replace our spell lines like other casters do, nor do we just take lower-level lines of our spells from parents like other hybrids do.  If we have our fufil's curtailing chant, well from 30-60 that is the ONLY MR debuff/dot we get, and if its totally ineffectual at level 55 thats just too bad, because there won't be an upgrade in your future.  Really the only songs we get that do exactly the same thing as the lower level version is...charm, I think, and thats because the level 27 was in at release and the level 39 was one of the infamous missing songs that lasted until about kunark time.<P>So, to balance bards you have to increase our level-effect caps on our songs, taking into account the raise in monster power between 50-60 when WE become 50-60 (since our level=song effect level augmented by instruments when possible)<P>And I would like to see our low-capped jack of all trades skills brought up to a level where they work at a fair level, like 2/3 or 1/2 the time of that skill's master expects success.<P>Plus significantly raiseing our defensive skills so that we're still below SK/Pally/ranger by a recognizeable ammount, just not a very large ammount.<P>-BUGS-<BR>Bards need better testing.  We get a ton of bugs that easy to spot, like the recent Selo's calamity.  There have been others, but really obvious things like that deserve to not be done in the first place.<P>PSALMS of purity and vitality (29/37)...they're supposed to cure poison and disease eventually right?? They are STILL broken.  I have never been able to cure someone with either of these songs, regardless of how many times myself or that other see the 'you've been cured' text.  Try it in hate on the kirakui disease.  I left the cure song on for about 10 minutes straight to no avail according to the afflicted paladin.  Thats a lot of pulses yes??  And she DID say that she saw the cure message a great many times.  It's been broken since release, they say it was fixed, but apparently that is not the case.  Check it please.<P>And many of our songs have caster effects now, and its the new ones.  Namely, the chants line 30/38/46, Nivs level 47, Shield of Song 49, Selos song of travel 51, and I believe our cantana at 55...casting effects with a lute or drum, can you pleeeeeease let me play my instrument like the bard I am instead of throwing it over my head and stretching!?!<P>Right...I realize this was very rambling but please look at the points themselves and don't just pick apart the construction of the paragraph.<BR>We bards DO know what we're talking about even if this one tends to ramble.<P>-Nadira Andante<BR>Bard of RALLOS ZEK<BR>Coin loot already exists, but only for the attackers.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to add my voice to those who are finding that carpal tunnel/wrist strain issues are interfering with our pleasure of playing a bard.  <P>Arianera is only 19.  She went from being my primary character to being the one that I play once a week in a group of friends in large part because my left hand _really_ aches after more than an hour of twisting songs.  And I hated having to make the change away from considering her my main character.<P>I don't have any suggestions on how to change the Bard mechanics to solve this problem, but I think that it needs to be thought about seriously.<P>I would also like to add my voice to those who think that Verant needs to spend a little more time testing things for bards and how bards interact with other spells.  Unfortunately, you seem to be using unique code for a single class, the bard, and variations on a type of code for all other casters.  Even though bard coding only affects bards, that does not reduce the amount of QA/QC needed for each type of mechanic to get it right.<P>Arianera, Bard 19, E'ci<BR>Jannet Willamsdotter, Shaman 23, E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The code for bards is NOT unique, which is clearly demonstrated when changes to conventional spells (such as root/snare stacking) end up breaking our songs.<P>But as concerns the twisting issues people bring up, how many of you have worked with the new /pause command and the key remappings to ease the strain?<P>Personally, I've employed the /pause command in 8 socials, which go like this: <P>/pause 5, /stopsong<BR>/cast 1 <P>for each song slot.<P>What this means is I no longer have to hit the key twice to turn the song off and then on.  One hit stops and starts the song, generally faster and more reliably than I can do it myself.  This cuts in half the mechanical work I have to do.<P>In addition, I've changed the mappings of my hotkey bank to better match how I use my hands and keyboard.  You can remap these to any keys you want now.

The quote pretty much says that he (or she) wanted the haste to bring him in line with a warrior for combat ability.<P>&gt;"The stackable haste songs require an instrument to be played, eliminating the bard's ability to deal melee damage. In order for the Eravj songs to be useful in any capacity, they must recoup the loss of the bard's melee ability and then some, otherwise, it's more efficient for the bard to keep on using his weapons. <BR>As it stands, adding an additional 5% haste to the entire party doesn't even come close to the damage that a bard can deal out if he continues to use his weapons, that's why we feel the percentage is too low."&lt;<P>All of this I understand.  Though it could easily be argued that a 5% haste, in the right party, could provide more damage than the bard's blades.  But the point is valid.<P>&gt;"Our levle 39 charm song requires mana each time it pulses. This was implemented to limit the amount of charming a bard could do. Using Dirge drastically impacts our ability to charm. Furthermore, is 300 hp of damage so powerful that it warrants only being useable every 40-80 minutes?"&lt;<P>No, it's probably no that powerful.  I'm just leary of the suggestions that bards gain their mana back a lot faster, as that affects the charm song as well.  Perhaps the better route is to look at the damage ratio or mana cost of the dirge.  For safety sake, I'll add both to the list.<P>&gt;"Lastly, you mentioned that you would be looking at the Lute of the Howler. Can you explain what about the lute makes it imbalancing? Bards (along with rogues) already recieve some illusions via items (mask of deception, mask of obtenbration, iksar hide mask) how do these differ from the lute's illusion?"&lt;<P>Actually, it isn't that different, not at all.  Though I can see a greater objection to the werewolf form, for two reasons.  It's not a player race, and it's the newest item to blurr that whole class distinction line.  But you need to understand that my personal feeling that this item (heck all of them really) is a bit out of place does not mean that the team will agree with me.  And even if they do, there's not a real high chance that anything would be done to the item.<P>NadiraAndante wrote:<P>&gt;"My personal issues about bards sortof parallel their previous work.

The game was played for a very long time at the haste cap and was still hard. Not all people have super haste items.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've always enjoyed playing a bard, and I have trouble thinking of myself as anything else.  However I must say that we have some fundamental problems that become more and more apparent at higher levels.  I think the problem is that Bards just don't quite fit the molds of the other classes.  I think that the confusion of what a bard should be is even a source of confusion for Verant themselves.  At least this is a logical conclusion from the many strange ways they have designed our class.  Are we a meleer with a little bit of magic?  Are we a caster with a little bit of meleeing?  If we are something totally different, are we being penalized for being perceived as being part of the other two choices?  I want to look at bards from the different ideas of what a bard is and discuss what I see as wrong with us and show how we are "double penalized" in both melee and magic.<P>Bards as Hybrid<BR>--------------------<BR>We are hybrids of sorts.  We have the ability to use many kinds of weapons (1 handed), and we can wear "plate".  So, what's the problem?  The problem is that we are heavily penalized melee wise more than any other hybrid.  Pallies and SKs lose a lot of offense in exchange for almost having the defense of warriors, and spell abilities.  Rangers get less defense in exchange for having spells and almost the offensive ability of a warrior.  Bards, on the other hand, get the worse end both ways.  From what I've seen, we are inferior to all hybrids on both sides of offense and defense.  Bards deal much less melee damage than even the weaker hybrid offensive skill of Pallies and SKs.  Bards, supposedly a tank class, are also fairly weak defensively as well.  I have about half the hitpoints of some similar level warriors I know.  I can wear plate, but many of our plate items get chain type AC.  Our defense as a whole is also probably weaker than the Ranger.  So, we are worse at offense and defense of all other hybrids, and therefore are double penalized.  We are also the only melee class or hybrid that does not get double attack. Even if we could get this at level 50 it would at least make us feel like we were contributing more, even if the cap wasn't very high on it.<P>If Bards are hybrids or meleers at all, then I think something must be done to improve our melee abilities.  I think that both offense and defense could reasonably be raised, however I think mainly defense.  I think that bard should be inferior offensively to all other hybrids, but maybe by not such a great degree.  However, I personally feel that defensively, any plate wearing class (such as a Bard) should have significantly better defense compared to a chain wearing class (Ranger).<P>Bards as Casters<BR>--------------------<BR>One of the Bard's strengths is that he has a good variety of magical abilities.  However, this is not without some shortcomings.  In early and mid level careers of a bard, these abilities make a huge contribution to the party.  We have a great number of songs that can help almost any party.  However, the higher up you get, the less useful you become for anything other than a mana battery (and those of you who know me KNOW how much I hate to admit that).  Our songs are redundant and inferior to those in almost any party.  Also we have the added problem of that many of our short lived and inferior spell effects overwrite many more powerful effects (particularly ones with multiple effects).  At higher levels, we just can't provide anything to the average party other than mana and magic resist buffs, which is very depressing for a bard who likes to feel useful and to have a bit of variety.<P>I think some of our songs are great for parties, and are at just the level of power, however there are many that become useless after just a few levels (if not useless immediately).  The problem with most of our songs is either the effect is too weak or it is resisted too often.  The problem with Bard magic is very similar to our problem in melee; we are double penalized.  Let me explain.<P>Our magic (with a couple exceptions) doesn't cost mana.  It is true this is a great advantage.  However, we pay for this advantage in many ways.  First, almost all of our songs are short lived, lasting between 1 and 4 ticks.  Fair enough.  Second, because of the first limitation, this creates the indirect limitation of being only able to have only a 2 or 3 songs effects going at a time on yourself, party, or a target.  Again, I can live with that… though one extra song would be wonderful.  Third, many of them are very highly resistable due to the fact that some of these songs have multiple effects.  Well, the high resist rates on some songs is annoying, but for the most part I can accept that in all cases EXCEPT in a few of our songs where the secondary effect is something that for all practical concerns does nothing except make our song harder to stick.  However, I think the main problem bards have is that despite having all of these disadvantages, we are stuck with the biggest disadvantage, and that is that our songs effects are just so weak in many cases.  The question is, for the sake of balance, are ALL of these penalties appropriate to offset the fact they are mana free casting?  There are many items out there that people can buy that have much superior effects to any bard song and are also mana free.  I think that if some of our songs were improved in effectiveness, this could go a great deal to us feeling more useful in parties.  I am even willing to sacrifice using weapons, and using only instruments if it could help increase song effectiveness to higher levels than it presently does.<P>A few examples:  An 8 point damage feedback for a Bard in his 40's or 50's is a joke.  We are regularly asked to stop playing our haste songs from enchanters and shamans so their better ones will stick.  Our snare causes the longer lived druid/ranger snare to cancel as well as the snare + DOT spells from necros and SKs.  To be honest, we do have a few targeted DoTs that are actually worth using, however I don't want a bunch of songs to help ME do more damage.  I want songs to help my PARTY do more damage and reduce their downtime.  The ONLY way a bard can do significant damage is to do nothing for the party, and that is even less effective in the long run than just playing the mana song all day long.<P>Bards and Groups<BR>---------------------<BR>I think this is really what bards are about.  I think they are supposed to help groups.  That's really all many of us want.  We want our songs to be more useful to groups, to be able to have a tiny bit more variety, and be able to contribute a tiny bit more in melee and tanking.  I don't want to melee better than any other hybrid, but I think I should be able to tank better than a ranger.  I don't want to be better at casting than any other caster, but I want my songs to at least be useful.  I love the fact that we are great at buffing magic resists and all, and I don't really mind that we have a good clarity song, but is there more to the bard life at high levels?<P>I want for their songs that are supposed to work to work without screwing up other people's spells, and I want to feel like I'm contributing to my party in a worthwhile manner, and give my party something to say besides "mana song plz."  For a class that is intended to be a "Jack of All Trades", let us do something besides the standard one or two songs at high levels.<P>Finnias, Bard of the 46th song.<BR>Fennin Ro<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Charm is another example of this, and I *know* for a fact that I cannot recharm a mob until the first charm wears off.<P>In addition, there is what appears to be a bug with our targeted songs.  If I target a mob and sing, for example, Bellow (that being the first targeted song we ever get) when it recycles for the next tick, it tells me that I must select a target.  That happens when I still have the same target selected.<P>What this means is that if we sing Chains and it's resisted, we cannot keep singing it until it takes... we have to manually stop it and start it again, or it will not re-attempt.  More mechanical operation of the game... more carpo-tunnel... more whines.  =)  Fix that, and our targeted songs will be a little bit more workable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>absor, in your above statment you addressed our 51 level snare song, it this statement you claimed that we got the snare for free. i disagree, since our songs are effectively all we do in combat by the time we are 51 to keep the snare active we are using 100% of our effectiveness on one thing. i fail to understand how having to use this song over and over again equates to free. not to mention that even if you do refresh it continuously it still may break. refreshing it every 3 secs(thats pretty optimistic) in no way guarentees that its going to stay snared, even if you gave it a ressist check every 3,4 secs it would be better than it is now, borderline useless.<P>i also saw a post a while back on the concert hall bard forums where parsing was done with the 50 and 60 level stackable haste that showed every melee in the group having to do more than 125 dps to constitute having a bard not wield a weapon. if this is true, how can you claim that it can be argued in anyway that a 5% increase in haste for a group(5% of a melees base haste i might add, not their true haste at the time) is worth the loss of even our small amount of damage since 125 dps is almost absurdly high?<P>anyway, stacking of haste/slow songs and the ineffectiveness of our snares are my only real complaint other than the sad effects on our kunark armor. for all other classes the effects are something for free, for our class, it isnt, my only suggestion there is to make it so we can use our effects while singing, honestly the only effect i ever use is the bracer and only then becuase its an effect i can give in a matter of secounds that lasts for minutes while i AM twisting songs. unforutnately or breastplate is the worst effect of them all, i can heal 1 person 100 points or heal an entire group for around 80 points.<P>nuff said<P>raldawen karaoke<BR>58 bard<BR>test server<BR>Scions of Yurpus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Personally i'd like to see our parry upped to maybe 100 or so and see double attack capped at 75.  Might as well throw riposte out because at a 75 cap it rarely works. (Needs to roll a parry first THEN a riposte roll? umm happens like a once in forever)<BR>With a parry of 100 or so we still wouldnt tank quite as good as rangers (AC doesnt always make you tank better, Dodge/parry/ac do) and our double attack would still be a lot lower than rangers/warriors.  I guess in the name of balance we'd get double attack at 55-57 or so but it would be an improvement.  I dont feel this would overpower bards but it would make being a bard a bit more useful and a little more fun.  <P>By the way whoever said cantana should be changed to pulse effect should be dragged out and SHOT.  The last thing i want to do is go back to my days of my group wanting me to play 1 song and 1 song only.

</FONT><HR>I'm going to assume that by balanced, you mean that there is a compelling reason to include a class in a group.  Based on that assumption, what are the compelling reasons to invite a player into a group?<P>To survive most encounters a party needs the following things:<BR>1. A damage doer<BR>2. A damage take<BR>3. Crowd control<BR>4. Runner control<BR>5. Damage mitigation (primarily healing)<BR>To maximize gains and lower risks the following things are also nice:<BR>1. Mana regen<BR>2. Ressurection<BR>3. Evac's<BR>4. Buffs<P>Granted, the number one reason we all play this game is to have fun and so the most compelling reason to invite a player into a group is to have fun.  However, for the majority of the people playing the game, ESPECIALY in the lvl 30+ crowd, fun is largely defined by gaining lvls and gaining loot.<P>Therefore, there is only a compelling reason to invite a class into a group if it falls into one of the above listed categories.<P>From lvl 1-20, bards are fine.  In fact, the classes are all fairly well balanced and the differences between them remain minor.<P>From lvl 20-50, bards remain a compelling class.<P>However, what is the compelling reason to include a lvl 50+ bard into a group?<BR>1. Damage doer: Bards can not match the output of a monk, rogue, wizard, warrior, SK, necro, druid, or mage.  Probably not a shaman either.  Against undead paladins will also outdamage us.  <BR>2. Damage taker: Uhhh don't think I need to detail this one :P<BR>3. Crowd control: Our charm hard caps at lvl 51 mobs.  Our aoe mezz is worthless and our single target mezz, while improved for the mid range bard, becomes essentialy a non viable solution at this lvl.  Enchanters are NOT the only way to go, but they are the primary means of crowd control at higher lvls.  Even necro's get a better crowd control than we do.<BR>4. Runner control: The problems with our snare song are numerous and well documented.  Besides, at lvl 51+ the real issue is interupting mob's trying to gate.  That means stuns.  That means chanters, clerics, wizzies, etc...<BR>5. Damage Mitigation: We could potential be very good at this role.  However, our slow songs do not stack w/ chanters and w/out a chanter you general don't have reliable crowd control.  Therefore, most lvl 50+ groups have a chanter and so there is no compelling reason to have a bard.  Our heal songs do stack w/ regen, however the song must be stopped while the regen is cast and the strength of our regen songs do not scale up vis a vis shaman/druid regens.  In fact, starting around lvl 40 this song appeared less and less often in my lineup.  Our rune songs are inadequate as a form of dmg mitigation since they absorb less that one hit from any given mob.<P>Note that a bard can not adequately do ANY of the 5 things needed by a party.  This wouldn't be quite so bad if we could ASSIST others in doing these things, but we can't do that well either.  Here's why:<BR>1. Damage doers: We can use our dmg songs to hurt the mobs, but since a true dmg does does this better, why use a bard?  We can haste the tanks, but shaman and chanters do it better and our songs don't stack with their haste.  Since lvl 50+ groups will almost always have a chanter, we can't help here either.  Our stat buff songs are nice, but at this point most tanks already have high stat scores, and are likely being buffed by another party member.  <BR>2. Damage takers: Well... given the high taunt nature of our songs, we can kind of act as a walking rune... you know, the tank takes no damage from the first 10 hits because the bard absorbs it all (then dies).<BR>3. Crowd control: Our mezz overwrites chanter mezz and lasts a shorter duration, if it lands at all.<BR>4. Runner control: See above<BR>5. Damage mitigation: Same problem as with damage doing.  Stacking issues mean that rarely can we be of much use here either.<P>So, not only can we not fullfill any of the needed jobs, we can't even act in tandem with another class to do the role.<P>Let's look at the secondary jobs:<BR>1. Mana regen: Yes, we still rule the roost here :/  The problem is, bards play the game to have fun as well... and going afk while playing the mana song for hours at a time and asking the group to port you out when they're done is NOT fun.  I exaggerate, but you get the point.  What's worse is that while we are better at mana regen than a chanter is, chanters are a passable substitute in this area, while bards are NOT a passable substitute for chanters in the NEEDED roles.<BR>2. Ressurection: Clerics.  Yeah, paladins and necros too to a very very limited degree.<BR>3. Evac's: well... we don't get them.  In the mid levels, we do have some tools that substitute or at least enhance.  AOE fear song is a great way to get a pack of goblins off your wizard in Droga.  It's a great way to die at lvl 50+<BR>4. Buffs: The problem with our post 50 resist buffs has been detailed extensively.  Our haste buffs have also been detailed.  Our part wide charisma buff is... interesting.  Yeah, we can offer a party something here, but not much... not at lvl 50+<P>Ok, given that, let's form a party.  We need a damage doer... get a monk, rogue, wizard, warrior, ranger, etc..  1 group slot gone.<BR>We need a damage taker... Warrior, Paladin, Sk.  2 group slots gone (and if your damage doer IS a warrior, it's still 2 slots gone because you're gonna need 2 of 'em to match the dmg output of the real dmg doing classes.)  We need someone for crowd control... Enchanter.  Maybe in a pinch, a necro.  3 slots gone.  We need runner control... Lot's of options here, none of them include a bard, 4 slots gone.  We need some form of dmg mitigation... Cleric.  Sorry, very very few post 50 groups venture out w/out one.  5 slots gone.<P>Who are we going to put in slot 6?  Well... we have mana regen covered w/ the chanter.  If we don't have a wizard or druid yet in one of the other roles, they better take slot 6.  For buffs, shaman rule the roost and they help w/ dmg mitigation a lot as well.  Ressurection is covered by the cleric.<P>Where does that leave a bard?  Out in the Eastern wastes...<P>Let's look at the same thing from a different perspective.  Which role can each class play (ie.. what is their compelling reason)<P>Warrior: Damage taker, primarily, also some dmg doing.<BR>Monk: Damage doer, some limited crowd control (fd pulling)<BR>Rogue: Damage doer<BR>Paladin: Damage taker, some dmg doing, more against undead<BR>Shadow Knight: Damage taker, some dmg doing. <BR>Ranger: Damage doer, runner control<BR>Cleric: Damage mitigation, ressurection<BR>Shaman: Buffer, damage mitigation, some dmg doing<BR>Druid: Buffer, damage mitigation, some dmg doing, runner control, evac<BR>Wizard: Damage doer, evac, some runner control<BR>Mage: Damage doer, combination dmg taker/mitigation w/ use of pet<BR>Enchanter: Crowd control, dmg mitigation (slows and runes), assists dmg doing (haste), mana regen<BR>Necro: Damage doer, combination damage taker/mitigation w/ use of pet, some runner control, some crowd control<BR>Bard: mana regen<P>Solutions:<BR>There are many many possible solutions to this problem. <BR>1. Beefed up crowd control abilities.  Bards don't need to be as good as an enchanter at crowd control.  They should be able to fill in as an acceptable substitute in MOST situations.  Raise the lvl cap on bard charm (it's mana based w/ no mana regen and lasts a maximum of 9 seconds).  Make lullaby require an instrument, capped at 4 mobs and take out the secondary resist.  A chanter can lock down 4 mobs w/out breaking a sweat and while they are mezzed, cast other spells.  Additionaly, spells cast by the chanter prior to the fight remain in effect.  Giving bards the ability to lock down 4 mobs is not unbalancing because unlike the enchanter, bards would not be able to do anything BUT mezz until the end of the fight.<BR>2. Increase EITHER the offensivie OR defensive abilites of bards.  Give us the ability to dish out more dmg either through increased melee skills or scaled up songs, OR give us the ability to TAKE more dmg through higher AC and defensive skills.<BR>3. Make our haste/slow songs stack w/shaman and chanter spells.  Let shaman and chanters be better at haste/slow, but let us contribute when these classes are present (and they will be in almost any lvl 50+ group)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I do not agree with having our defensive caps raised.<P>First off, I don't understand how we can be lumped along with SKs, and Paladins as a more defensive class if we lack the 1 most important defensive ability, Taunt. No matter how much aggro our songs give I don't see how it's possible that they taunt better than the actualy taunt skill of a warrior, sk, or paladin.<P>Going with this thought, I also realize that I think that our songs have too low off an aggro level. Yes I know many of you are going to think I'm absurd but bear with me on this line of thought. <P>I have noticed that when grouped with a decent, similarly equiped taunting class...I will more often than not never get hit in melee battle, unlees I'm riposted which can be fixed by fighting from behind. Maybe this is unique to my play experience but almost all of the usual song combinations I employ do not generate enough aggro to gain the attention of a mob from the taunting tank. The only song that comes close is Song of Shields.<P>In a single pull encounter I see no need for additional defensive skills or abilitiies...in fact i do see the need for increased aggro as every so often i do want to take a hit so as to properly maximize any songs i am using that have any sort of healing component.<P>I do however see the problem of such low defensive skills and the way our songs work.<P>In multi pull situations every single add will decide that the lil bard that may have just been singing mana song is now the enemy. And in this situation no matter what kind of defensive abilities, save for deft dance, they give us we will take a pounding. The only defense against train aggro would be more hp which I don't feel we really need.<P>Our true defensive problem lies in our songs weakness of aggroing strays, giving us better defensive skills does not fix the heart of the problem.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The 10% haste increasing song that requires brass wont slow you down if you have the bard epic, trust me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Anyway, on to some suggestions.<BR>I suggest that we have our parry and riposte skills raised to 100 by level 60.  I also suggest that our defense raises over where it is now by level 60.  However, just as a cleric is the ONLY real healer, an enchanter is the ONLY real crowd control.  I think spells along the line of Kelins Lugubrious Lament are nice, as they are the bards way of alluring single pulls by enchanting songs.  I think that maybe we should get a high level mes (57+ at least) that takes mana and can mes high level encounters.  I do not feel we need any additional charm songs, as charming is not a commonly used spell in high level raids.  <P>As I said before, I believe we should have a song that lasts until deactivated, but has a recast of around 20 minutes.  This would mean no juggling.  This song would allow the bard to enter a state very similar to warriors defensive discipline.  However, a bard could not attack durring this time either.  This would be a very nice addition, and a great way to see a truly NEW song, and not just a new version of an old crummy tired one.<P>I also think that a gate type song with a 60 minute recast would be very nice to see at around 55-60.<P>Most of all, if you change nothing else, I would LOVE to see bards recieve a 30 minute recast (after success only, doesnt start timer on a fail) FD song.  A bard should be able to use this song too fool his enemies into thinking he has been slain.  FD pulling would not work with this obviously, and it would be in no way unbalancing.  It would be really nice to see bards recieve a treat for once...if we're going to be manaslaves forever, the least we could get is a 30 min refresh FD to reward us for being the batteries we are.<P>siabot L60 bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hope you are reading this far  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I just read over your entire replies to various bard threads so I hope this hasn't come up yet  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  You asked if you can try and get rid of twisting so bards don't get arthritus from this game, so I was thinking...<P>How bout at certain levels, our spell slots get an additional one next to it.  Something like<P>Spell 1a 1b 1c<BR>Spell 2a 2b 2c<BR>Spell 3a 3b 3c<BR>...<P>The game should register it as doing spell 1a, then 1b, then 1c  as soon as it can be done.  This would give bards the ability to click a button and twist CONTINUALLY, while meleeing (if you still do).  If a bard gets kicked out of his/her song, the songs reset and Everquest doesn't recognize that it needs to continue on with the chain.  That idea should only be on the bards first three spell slots so they can twist the songs where it kicked off, such like<P>1a 1b 1c = 1a 1b 1c<BR>2a 3b 3c = 1b 1c 1a<BR>3a 3b 3c = 1c 1a 1b<P>It might help...might not.  I am not up in the levels enough to know how bards do raids.  This will also help downtime since a bard doesn't always have to twist three difference songs to minimize downtime potential, since he now can do it at a click of a button.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off, let me say that I strongly oppose any introduction of autotwisting in the game.  A great deal of the skill of a bard lies in constantly changing twists, double pulsing a vital song that gets resisted (eg snare), and generally paying constant attention to the changing battle scene.  Any change that encourages bards to in essence play badly has got to be wrong.<BR>However, pulse songs such as hymn of restoration, clarity amd the cantonas should certainly pulse every 3 seconds to allow us to take a break between fights.<BR>Before writing this post I should say that I've put a great deal of thought in the last few days into what I think a bard is (and isn't).  My view of a bard is as a buffer, rallying his allies with rousing songs; as a debuffer, freezing or scaring an enemy; as a limited fighter able to take a little damage; but mostly as a group supporter able to step in at the vital moment.   In no way should a bard ever be a damage dealer and I feel that where bard damage at high levels is sorely lacking it would be more 'bardic' to compensate with group skills at this stage than to have any real change in direct damage output.<BR>Now to issues of balancing.  The buggest problem with bards currently must surely be the issue of haste/slow stacking, particularly at high levels.  Having thought about it some I must agree with the design team that whilst it could be tweaked a little full stacking is just going to be unbalanced with the super hastes/slows of enchanters/shamans.  Starting from that basis it seems sensible to gives bards enough good secondary songs to make them useful to a party even without hasting/slowing but to make it so that these are not optimal when an enchanter and shaman is not present.<BR>Looking for a useful debuff my suggestion is a good AC debuff song.  This song should be such that hasting a typical tank does more damage than lowering it's AC, but that the amount of additional damage done with tanks hasted by an enchanter is significant.  A good time to get this song would be level 44 - it's about this stage that the haste issue becomes most thorny and the existing level 44 song is not really worth buying for most bards.<BR>When looking for a good buffing line I focused on the level 49 song that is in effect a 20 point rune for both melee and magical damage.  My suggestion is to split this song into a melee rune song and a separate magical rune song but make it so that both absorb more damage at higher levels.  A low-powered but suitable formula would be (level minus 45) times 5.  This gives rune values of 20hp at level 49 rising to 75hp at level 60 - not excessive given the amount that mobs hit/cast for but at least allowing the bard to add something tangible.<BR>Another topic I have seen raised is that of bard hitpoints.  I believe it is quite correct that bards pay heavily for their songs and should not generally make good complete heal targets.  Having said that I think there is some scope here to raise them above the caster category.  If an unbuffed level 50 human bard with base(75) stamina were to have about 1500hp that would seem about right.  I'm not sure of the exact figures but I'm guessing about a 10% rise in base hitpoints would give that and still make bards by far the weakest hybrid class in this category.<BR>On the fighting front, a small increase in skill caps for dodge, parry, riposte and piercing would seem in order.  It's right that bards should not be experts like warriors but we should be able to take some damage.<P>As I described above I see bards songs as essentially affecting the emotions/minds of their listeners in a modest way.  Whereas enchanters can use powerful magicks to wipe an entire mind a bard's mind affects should be short-lived and/or only have partial effect.  Within this frameweork there are a few songs that would enable a bard to be of more use to a party both as a tank and as a crowd control stand-in without impinging on the specialised roles of true tanks or enchanters.<BR>The first such song would be a pure taunt.  This song would do no damage but add a temporary (9 second) boost to the bard's position on the hate-list.  This of course is a song of limited uses, really only when the bard is acting as main tank at low levels, or as an emergency quick taunt off a caster.  As it doesn't stack hate it's never going to be even close to a tank's taunt skill but it will at least make a party think before sending bards away saying they need a taunting tank only.  Looking at the song list the level 24 song is now almost useless due to changes elsewhere so that would be a possible time to introduce it.<BR>The second idea here is to have a selective memory blur song allowing a bard to save party members in limited situations but not as powerful as an enchanter's blur line.  The idea of this song is to remove only the most hated foe from a creature's hate list.  In this way it would take 6 pulses (18 seconds) for a bard to fully blur a creature.  More practically it can erase a caster from the hate list when they are being beaten to a pulp.  A nice side-effect of this is that if the bard taunts a mob wrongly this song would act as an antitaunt hopefully moving the mob to someone else.  This seems like a mid level sort of song to me and as the level 35 mana drain song is rarely if ever used in non-PvP this is a good level for such an effect.<BR>The third idea is really just an upgrade to what I thought bards should always be about - making creatures fall asleep in a radius about them.  The level 15 bard song has this effect but becomes very highly resisted from 25 upwards.  During the mid-levels a bard can generally cope with crowd control by a mixture of mezzing (Pixie Strike) and tanking.  As mobs hit so much harder post-50 this becomes infeasible so a repirse of this role at this stage is in order.  I would say that an area-effect mez song with about 3/4 the effectiveness of enchanter AE mez would sit well, forcing the healer to spend massive amounts of mana to keep the bard alive but at least making an encounter feasible with good teamwork.  It also has the effect of allowing the bard to 'take a death' while the party fless in relative safety.  I suggest level 50 for this.<BR>All of these 3 songs have the common theme of giving the bard a way of helping group members when they need it most without adding significant power to the class.  I believe this is the key in balancing them, to concentrate on giving them skills useful in certain situations but without increasing their power significantly across the board (as that is fine for the most part).<BR>Lastly I can't finish without asking why the charm line finishes so abruptly and early.  Bards get charm songs at level 27 and 39, so I don't think a song at level 51 would be out of order or give themn something that the vision of a bard suggests is wrong.  However, as they already get 2 songs at level 51 perhaps waiting till level 52 is timely.  Given the above ideas this would give high level bards the full range of crowd control abilities (target/area mez/stun, charm, blur) but just in a very limited way when compared to an enchanter.<BR>One more thing - I wholeheartedly agree about the lute of howling.  Such magic is too vulgar for a simple bard who's magic should generally be subtle IMHO.  My suggestion here, rather than remove it, is to add a right-click effect that adds 10 STR and 10 ATK for 5 minutes - call it Howl to the Moon or some such.<P>That's all for now,<P>          Zelandakh (bard of Tarew Marr)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053745&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053745&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
