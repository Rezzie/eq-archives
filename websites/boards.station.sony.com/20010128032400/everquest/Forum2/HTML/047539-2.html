</FONT><HR>ok went to karnors, at zone was clear no trains so thought solo a few get my 56, did. pulled out the dog 850 mana, gave him kragg and shouud 575 mana, str agi sta (the best ones) 400 mana, celerity 185 mana,  invested at this point (2010)<P>there was of course crunching in between :P<P>i went and proceded to pull a drolvarg (blue to me) with tugurs 250 mana and it actually stuck, and i did not fizzel OMG.  brought it to where I parked dog at zone, rooted the drolvarg, and sent in the 2010 mana pet.  well he hit it a bit took off maybe 1/15th of its life and was destroyed. I see no improvement whatsoever over the 49th lvl spell here sad to say. Oh well he did get in a shot for like 33.  Remember the dog was hatsted 50% and the drolvarg speed reduced about 75% these numbers are roughly what i understand these 2 spells to produce. I guess he could be used kiting outdoors nipping at the mobs heals, as long as the mob did not turn to attack it. But for 2010 mana is it worth the effort?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>unhappycustomer_69, that doesn't prove anything. A 51 earth pet(lv42~47), focused with earth staff/burnout/dmg shield, can take away 20~35% of sentry's health before croaking. Somehow, you expect your pet(37~39) to do better?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Pet isn't shaman's main ability. At least varent enhanced lv55 summon to be better than their previous summons. DOn't you have better shaman issues to deal with? <P>Another thing, did i miss something? Druid, wizard, necro and shaman all have ability to solo effectively to lv 60..necro and shaman can solo on their own, on top of that they have pet to make it  more convenient. Yet some of you are still pissed that magician's pet is strongest? Obviously i missed something, my magician's solo days were over at lv53 when 90% of sea fury cyclops turned green.<P>As for some uninformed person few msgs ago, sure necro pet loses to magician pet. BUt do magacian get root? fd? powerful stacking dots? darkness slow/dot spell? mez? charm? res? mana regen? ivu*chuckle*? lifetap? self to other heal? While at it, do shaman not have ability to heal? powerful dot? slow spell? stat buffs? talisman? dd? haste? regen? sow? Would someone refuse to group shaman just because they have weaker pet? hmm?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You are not getting the point.<P>This is yet another nerf to the shaman class.<P>The shaman class was built from L1-L50 in terms of balance with the shaman pet factored into the equation. In the pre-50 game our pet was very nice to have around.<P>In the post 50 game our pet is useless b/c of its level and the fact that 1. They admit now it had to low of natural stats (dodge) 2. It costs 350 mana more to cast than the L49 pet spell for less dmg output (now) which leads to more downtime.<P>And on top of this we do not have access to our spells. On E'ci there is *1* copy of POX and it was just gotten a week or so ago. This is 9 months after ROK was released. THe average number of BoN spells per server is probably 6 and the average POX per server is probably 3. How you can sit there and say that we can solo well is beyond me. Yes we can solo but that is not the point. The point is that we don't have access to our spells and the ones we do get are a joke or end up getting nerfed yet again like this one just did.<P>It is not a 2 point difference it is a 4 point difference. L37 pet hit before 51 dmg, L37 now hits for 47.<P>Druids can solo well in the post 50 game IMO because their new DOTs are sold on vendors. Ours are mob drops only and come later at L56 and L59.<P>Hell event the druids got nerfed with the cleric CH/E line of new spells. Completely destroyed the Druid group regen line.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I probably could tell you a thing or 2 about your pets. for example, her pet (with my haste) vs a drolvag (with my slow)  (remember there are variants here you did not take into consideration you silly flamer)  anyway :P her pet uttely destroys a drolvarg with 70 percent of its health remaining. WITH NO OTHER BUFFS THAN THAT.  look before you leap. I leave it at that. I have done several test with her with our pets in the past so believe me I know full well the strengths and weaknesses of both. (as well aas with necors pets) You get to do things like that when you have friends<BR>Ill respond this once and this once only to such a remark. <BR>I am trying for the shaman community to improve shortcommings that have been around for some time. go find a mage post </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

A 51 earth pet(lv42~47), focused with earth staff/burnout/dmg shield, can take away 20~35% of sentry's health before croaking. Somehow, you expect your pet(37~39) to do better? <P>burnout and damage shield huh? that costs over 2000 mana does it? I think not... <P>Also remember our pet was up against a mob that was slowed by 75% Against the same mob... slowed, your pet by your own admission would kill the mob!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>sorry forgot the most important part, when did i ever say i was mad Mages have such a powerful pet? WHY WOULD I BE? When we team (such as at ice giants) i would buff and heal her pet while we sat there and chatted while the potatoe effectively soloed for us :P I want nor seek nerfs to any other class, nor have I ever. All I seek is to overcome some obvious and painful shortcommings to the shaman class. Sorry this is off subject at hand.  People please remember its the coders and design team who give Absor the nformation to work with, they are the ones who set him up to look foolish not once but twice now, its them who we need Absors help to convince to stop the foolishness and games concerning our class. Try and stay constructive, and focused on one at a time. Eventually Absor will see we are comming from the experience of playing this class through the lvls to have noticed these imbalances and shortcommings for what they are. He has steped to the plate after being given false info to propagate, not once but twice now. The pet issue was imo just a game the coders/design team played  ok add here take there equal pet in the end</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thanks for letting us know. At least "something" was done to the shaman pet but to be honest it feels like youre throwing us a bone. Frankly we expected more. So im afraid if you think the shaman community are going to be jumping for joy over this, you are mistaken. <P>Im a level 58 shaman. The reason no one noticed it is because so few shaman post 55 ever use the pet. This is stark contrast to ever having reason to use a pet. We have a reason to use a pet all the time. We just dont use this because of the cost benefit of it and the mana efficiency in relation to the group dynamic.  The change you made truly is a "Stealth upgrade." The upgrade you made is so imperceptible that NO ONE would notice an increase in performance. <P>The reasons for this are high mana cost, low damage output, bad dungeon pathing=aggros, mana drain on cleric to keep this pet alive. This is in sharp contrast to pre 50 when the shaman pet from 34 to 49 is used extensively. Now, doesn't that beg the question of what you at VERANT have done to make this situation exist.  What if all of a sudden you made a "steath" enhancement to necro or mage pets and no one noticed? What if when you posted it, all the necros and mages said, well the reason is because post 50 we never cast our pets? Wouldnt that ALARM you? Wouldnt you scratch your head and find out why?<P>Historically lets take a look at our pets.<P>Lvl 34 pet  mana cost 350<BR>Lvl 39 pet  mana cost 400<BR>Lvl 44 pet  mana cost 450<BR>Lvl 49 pet  mana cost 500<BR>Lvl 55 pet  mana cost 850<P>I didnt mention how much it hits for or its range which are all important features. Ill let others talk about that. The one thing I want to talk about and I would LOVE to hear you give an explanation for is the for the huge departure of mana cost pre 50 and post 50 and why the level of the pet was put back one compared to previous levels. Following previous levels, we should get this pet for 550 mana and at level 54.<P>So once again this begs the question of why? All I want is an explanation. I want to hear the rationale you used to justify by upping the level to 55 and and upping the mana cost to 850. Now, if you actually increased the shaman pets to something similar to the upgrade the Sks got I dont think you would hear any of us complaining about mana cost. Which again, begs the question. Why is a hybrid melee such as an SK have a SIGNIFICANTLY better pet than the shaman. Now im not asking for a nerf of the sk im just asking you explain to us the logic of all this....Is that to much to ask?<P>Finally, if shaman pets truly are "companions" as <BR>was said by the previous host then doesnt that imply by the very definition that they arent combat pets and by that definition wouldnt justify the 850 mana cost. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-Turkeyshoot<P>Sadly, I think the way Verant came to the "logical" mana requirement probably ran something like  this:<P>They said a while back that the time and effort it took to get from 50 level to 60 was similiar to the time it took to go from 1 to 50. Now some coder probably thought to himself, "Hmmm self, so we are giving shamans the spell at level 55 and every level after 50 is like 5 levels pre 50. How will I figure out the new mana requirement?! OH! EUREAKA! Since, 50 to 55 is 25 levels pre-50, and therefore 5 spells ranks, I'll just multiply the 50 mana increase per level times 5 and voila, a 750 mana spell. Hrmmm, but wait, 750 is like a C- on a 1000 point scale. I hated when I got C's in college, so I'll slap on another 100 which will make it a B-!"<P>And there you have the prize logic. We shamans got a B- for just being barely above average.<P><BR>Ourang U'Tahn<BR>Dishelveled Medicine Man of Drizzul Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

"<BR>- what's amusing is, that you are comparing lv 37~39 pet(shaman) vs 44~47 of strongest pet(magician) in the game. Now you expect them to do comparable dmg?<P>Speaking of flame, your whole tone carries "i am uber than you", which in itself is a flame.
