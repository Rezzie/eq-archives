</FONT><HR>I posted this before, but it disappeared!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>For those of you who don't know what that is, it is the art of map making. I was thinking, when a certain kind of player (I'm thinking Half Elves, and no I don't play one, never have actually...but really I was thinking it could be a bard skill, cause they are supposed to be travelers, that's a bias opinion tho LOL) enters a zone, and they have a high enough skill, the could make a map. There would be components involved such as scrolls, ink pens (maybe a surveying tools of some kind, a tinkered item maybe!). The maps would start out quite crude, but then moving up in detail as the skill increased. Components would be QUITE expensive to make balance. Or, possibly, they could be NO RENT items. The maps would all look the same (depending on skill). So there would be the base map (the highest skil), and then from there you just subtract things on the map, less detailed if you will.<P>I mean, you can't really say this would disrupt game balance too much, people go to sites and print out maps all the freakin time eh?!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Thanks <BR>-Red<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree. It would be nice if we could access online maps that  would only show portions of the continent that we have explored. It would also give players some incentive to go out and explore. We should have the option of recording LOC's and making markers on the map.

But limiting it to where you have been or have been to recently is really a good idea.

</FONT><HR>I like the idea of mapping skill and have posted before on the general discussion and wishlist. Also there is a 3rd party program that already does this. But Verant does not allow 3rd party programs. I think they could convert the beg and the sense heading and the spell true north into a mapping skill if they wanted to with very little coding. I think this would be great for levels 1 to 5 to have for the newbie zone all the time then go away. Then to get it back you would have to practice the skill at first it would be just a compass type thing then a zone map ouline, then trails, then zone exits and entrances, then cities, but would never show spawn points or locations of spawn. If it was a dungeon or city it would just show the dungeon outline, entrances/exits, rooms and again no merchant or spawn points. This is what I would like to see.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This would be really cool. Especially if you could map by exploring. For instance, you wouldn't be able to see anything on the map that you haven't actually visited yet. Exploring new places is what I love most about this game and a skill like this would make it so much more enjoyable. I like the marker idea too, though I'm sure Verant wouldn't go for that part of it since you could mark spawn points and such. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Um this trade skill is already in the game, but there is are two secret materials you need in order to use it. The materials unfortunatly don't drop and are not sold by any everquest vendor, so you will be forced to spend real money to get them. The good news is that these items are very commen and avliale in many places, and not just from other everquest players. These items are a pad of paper and pencil. You may also need and erasor if your pencil did not include one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>EQatlas has all the maps you would ever need, so without some kind of in-game bonus Cartography would be about as useful as Cooking.  Here is my suggestion:<P>1.) Maps are only of a single zone.  In order to make a map, the cartographer must be in that zone (eliminates the nightmare of coding AutoMaping).<P>2.) Maps are of various quality depending on your skill level and the components, same as everything else.<P>3.) Maps are equipable in the secondary slot.  When you have a map of your current zone equipped, you get a slight movement bonus, a bonus to Sense Heading, a bonus to Forage - stuff like that.  The higher quality the map the higher the bonus.<P>A whole new market would open up for scrollcases.  Imagine a quest for a magical scrollcase that will hold 8 or 10 maps at once...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think Verant will do this, because I think they are under the misguided notion this would somehow take away from the experience of exploring the world. We know they did not approve of the in game maps available in EQ-Macros so we pretty much know this will never happen.<P>But, in a lot of ways I think it would be a good idea. Not only would it be interesting for RP reasons, but it would actually incourage exploring. After all who goes around running into unknown territory without a care. You want to know that if you get aggregoed you can find the zone fast enough to get away! This game does NOT incourage exploration simply because of the fact that it is terribly difficult to escape high level mobs whey they are on you. If something is significantly higher than you, you don't have a chance to make it to the zone. Even if it isn't, you have to run WAY before you are going to die, because almost everything runs just as fast as you and just keeps hitting you hardly missing a beat (you'd think a running man would be harder to hit) and once your health gets to a certain point you slow WAY down. This is exacerbated by the extremely wide diversity of the mobs levels and the fact that they often tend to roam pretty much anywhere. It's true that they spawn in different locations which follow some sort of a level progression from one end of a zone to the other, but when they start wondering about that sort of system just goes right out the window. Anybody who's played on a server that isn't so old that you run into a 50th level player ever thirty seconds will recall the threat of the Griffons in East Commons. Those Griffons do NOT belong in that zone IMHO. It is mobs like them, air elementals, gouls, Dorn!, ect... that thoroughly DISCOURAGE exploration until you are high level. Of course, by then it's a mute point. By the time you are high enough level to survive a Griff attack, (much less kill it) you have long since known the layout of EC. You have to learn at the peril of your life, because you have to fight in these areas with these higher level mobs that can and will kill you. The mobs you will get experience off of are in these zones. It almost doesn't matter what the zone is, there is usually a mob or two that are much higher level than all the rest, but only a few of them. This ensures that nobody bothers camping them until the server is crowded, and even then they're not always killed. So there are a LOT of things that discourage exploration, and not too many that incourage it. Heck, I play a 19th level rogue and I hardly know anything very far from Freeport. I've been to West Karana once, Ferroot once, Across the sea to Kelethin maybe three or four times. I've visited a total of four cities included Freeport, and only explored Freeport. Why? Why not? Why should I risk my neck to explore the world? Almost everything I want is in Freeport, and when it isn't I run go get it, and then come back. I've been in two dungeons so far. I went a little ways into Befallen (which seems much too low level now). I don't care for Befallen. I find undead kinda boring. Only thing I found interesting was locked doors for me to pick, but everybody just gets keys there, so I'm no help. And, I went to LGuk to get the Mask of Deception. I think I'll do some hunting there soon if I can get a group. That's a much more interesting dungeon, although Frogloks are admittedly silly. Maps would definately encourage exploration!<P>Okay, enough with the justification for maps argument. Of course there is the whole point about the maps on the internet. This is both a plus and minus for cartography as a skill, IMO. First of all I think that Verant is fooling themselves if they think they are denying maps to anybody and forcing them to play the game according to the supposed "vision". (Personally, I wish they'd forget the vision and just give us what we ask for. The gameplay in EQ is very narrow, but the games appeal is very broad. This results in many players becoming disgruntled with the game and the company since the game does not allow them to enjoy themselves as it should. If Verant were a little more open minded, this would be less of a problem, but that's just my opinion.) In this way the online maps should be posative, because whatever Verant thinks they can achieve by not having in game maps is defeated by the online ones anyway, so they should give it up. There is a negative side, and it's been mentioned. Why go to the expense and trouble to build up this cartography skill when you can print off the maps online? Well, I think there should definately be some in game uses for maps. I don't know if I exactly agree with the ones mentioned, but something should be devised. I'll think about it more later.<P>What I really want to talk about is implementation. There have been lots of good ideas here on implementation of cartography, however most of them would have required it to have been a part of the game from the beginning. And many also just wouldn't uhhh jive with the way Verant has put the game together. So... I got some suggestiongs. First of all it could either be a diddy do nothin' little skill like fishing lures, or it could be a full blown trade skill. I'll discuss my ideas for the full blown trade and everybody can deduce simplified systems based on it. Keep in mind I just brainstormed up some ideas on this, it's not very well thought out.<P>Personally, I wouldn't make this skill class specific. I think just about any class should get the skill. Any race too I suppose. However, it could be available for certain classes at different levels. I like the idea of Bards and Rangers being cartographers. Personally I also especially like the idea of rogue cartographers as well. (Perfect skill complement for Hide/Sneak.) It may be a good idea to have the skill cap based on level, in fact I suggest it. Why? Well so you don't get some level 5 making maps of LGuk and selling 'em for lot's of cash to higher level players. However you want to cap it, doesn't matter that much to me, just as long as level figures in there. The skill of course would be largely int and wis based, so the dumber races will have dumber maps. It might even be a good idea to have a read maps skill that everybody else using the map would have to develop. It could be tied to or even simply be Sense Heading. (I'd make it a unique skill for many reasons, one of which is that simply spamming SH will cap it fast.)<P>Let's get to the mechanics, however. Most of the suggestions so far have been pretty vague, and some have suggested things that would require a great deal of work to implement. One suggestion was to make it so that the cartographer could not map out areas of the zone they had not been too. This definately would be a good idea. Otherwise sombody could map an entire zone just by sitting at the zone border. I believe that players should have the oppurtunity to use maps to aide them in learning a zone (not so detailed of maps that they wouldn't have to learn it at all), but cartographers shouldn't automatically be able to map an entire zone just because they were in it. Still, how do you implement this? Keep in mind we cannot modify the zones themselves... or rather we do not wish to. The more work this skill is to implement the more expensive it will be to do so, the longer it will take to do so, and the less likely that it will get done. (...when pigs fly anyway, but I'm talking hypothetically) Okay the mechanics... just some ideas, not really a fully conceived system. Obviously we start with the Cartography Kit item... whatever it shall be called, I don't much care. Do some research, find some name that's historically accurate to something remotely similar and go with that. How exactly the kit is made/obtained is not that big a deal, but then I don't think it should be terribly difficult. I also don't think it should be as easy as getting say, a sewing kit. This should be a reasonably difficult skill. (We don't want every other person in Norrath to be a cartographer do we?) If we're following the Verant tradition, then this trade should be quite a time/money sink, with little reward. Okay no problem, it already has to compete with online maps you can print.<P>Okay, so you got a high enough level for your class, trained 1 or more points into the cartography skill, and got a kit, now what do you do with it? Get components. Components should be simple, pen and paper right? Well... You need a quil, right? Maybe this item could be bought from a couple of merchants, perhaps it could also be tinkered. There might be different quils for higher quality maps too, which would be more expensive. Ink, *cough*dye*cough* sounds like this could be done in a very similar fashion. I think I'd actually make ink production a bit simpler. Let's say make ink doable via alchemists and rogues via mortar and pestle. Don't make it too tough and make the ink stackable. (hint - you're going to use a lot) Obviously, if you want to add diversity to cartography you could have different kinds of ink, possibly even enchanted ink. (mwahaha I'm getting evil with this, no wonder trade skills are hard, designing them is too fun!) Third major component, of course, is something to write on. There could be one, all encompassing item for this (parchment?) or it could likewise have different items that have different effects on the map. Imagine involving skins, pelts, parchment, getting tailors involved, ect... (This is also addicting, I'm just a hair away from making up a whole component and recipe list. I'm just crazy enought to do something like that.)<P>Well, that's the simple stuff. Not really the mechanics. Here's some ideas on the mechanics. First of all for every attempt pretty much everything but the quil is destroyed. You get to keep the quil, even on failures, but they are expensive. Maybe on rare failures you loose the quil too. (pure evil) It could in fact be a tinkered only item, that would be plane mean, but... Hey, look at it this way, if we're going to implement some of those nice map features talked about before then we gotta make sure there aren't too many cartographers. (...improves sense heading, ect... I would NOT have it increase movement speed. We don't want to cut into SOW's territory or Shamans will hate cartographers.) Now as for making sure Mr. or Mrs. Cartogropher actually explores the zone and only maps what they know. I don't think this would be all that difficult, actuall, but it would be somewhat less automatic. Here's my idea. Cartogrophers buy (or make) stackable sketch paper, err parchment... whatever. Small, stackable, not particularly expensive stuff. You put one standard ink container, one quil, and one sketch paper into kit and combine. This does not give you a usable map. heh Instead, you have created a sketch of one particular aspect or detail of the zone. (Provided you passed the skill check, of course.) This actually mimics what a true cartogropher (given the level of technology) would do. You are essentially taking notes, before actually attempting to map the zone. The sketch itself is of a particular feature, but you can't use it like a map. Oh and it's no drop. It would be worthless to other cartogropher's in real life, and same here. Why all this? It forces our cartogropher to walk the zone, sketching as they go. Nobody will be mapping an entire zone without taking more than ten paces into it. How does it work? Simple thing to include. Basically this part of the skill would do a /location when you make the attempt. Each zone would be split into areas and the skill would mathmatically deduce which area you are in based on your location. This would require a table of areas and coordinates for each zone, but that wouldn't be too difficult to create, and wouldn't modify any existing files. Each area could have a different difficulty to map it. For instance sketching the tunnel entrance in EC would probably be pretty easy (mainly because it is both prominant, and an entrance to another zone), but the druid thingy would be more difficult. Why different difficulties? Different recipes for the map's themselves my friend. You see, there's a second step. In the second step you need a large piece of parchment, or a skin, or whatever is goint to be used. You may need better or more or more kinds of ink as well. So you will put the large parchment, your ink, quil, and several sketches into the kit and poof. Heh, guess what happens when you fail? You get the quil back. Succeed, and you got a quil and a map. But each zone get's perhaps three different levels of quality on the maps. Low quality maps only require the low quality sketches, higher quality ones require higher quality sketches in addition to the lower quality ones. Like I said, the sketches are no drop. Now this as is requires the creation of hundreds of items. That is the weekness so far. It would be easy to scale back to only one map per zone if necessary. Also some zones may actually be unmappable. For instance the planes of fear, and hate, ect... Perhaps these are unmappable since they are not of the physical realm...  *shrug* Whatever exscuse you come up for would do. Certain zones may be deemed too complex to be mapped, or certain areas, ect. There are also the secret areas. Perhaps only rogues can map the entrance to the rogue guild, and it is somehow notated in a graphic version of thieves cant. Perhaps the Dark Elves can also make such secrets. It could be that the secret maps are simply unreadable by certain races and or classes, or it might hinge on your language skills. Parts of the maps might be hidden to the non rogue who reads a map with the rogue guild marked. However you'd like to do it. It would be easier for the whole map to either be legible or illegible, but if you build in a system of hiding certain details depending upon the player trying to use the finished map, then you could also bring in a map reading skill. A higher skill would allow you to make more sense out of the map. Heck somebody with a low skill might try to read the map upside down. *grin* That would be fun. But let's keep it simple. No map reading, no hidden item within a map. You either read the map or it makes no sense to you, because of your background. We still have a whole set of sketches for every zone that have to be unique. (After all it wouldn't make sense to be able to use a "First Inn" sketch from WC to make an EC map.) That's a lot of freakin items. I've got a suggestion, lot's of people won't like, but it would work. Make most of the sketche items pretty generic like that, so that there are many, in several different zones. You would have things like "Tunnel Entrance", "West Trail", "Mountain Pass", "Docks", "First Inn", "Third Derv Camp", ect. Now these are just sketches, they are notes. In way of an excuse you simply cannot create the entire map from the mere sketches, but likewise you cannot do it without them because you can't see every detail of a large area at once. Let us say that the sketches are really very temporary things, like something you skribble on a post it note on the way to the store. If you aren't reminded what context the sketch belongs in sooner or later you will forget, and it becomes worthless. (Do you see what I'm leading up to here?) Basically, what I'm saying is that if you zone you loose your sketches. I myself don't like it, but it is the simplest solution. If you loose them every time you zone, then you must make all your sketches without leaving that zone. This means you could never have sketches from two different zones in your inventory. Eureka! Hundreds, possibly thousands of unique sketch items have just been reduced to a couple dozen. Considering the kit can only be 10 slots maximum, and you will have to use at least three slots for ink, quil, and large parchment, the most sketches a zone would ever have is 7. You could pretty easily divide each zone into seven distinct areas then come up with generic sketch items for all those areas. Most sketch items would be used by multiple zones. Of course, if we wanted to add some complexity you could have to make intermediate maps from the sketches then combine those to make the entire zone map. I would suggest this, because the seven sketch upper limit is assuming we only use one container of one kind of ink. If we want to do anything with that we will reduce the slots available for the final combine to make the finished map. Keep in mind that we wanted three different levels of quality on the maps, dictated mainly by the how many and which sketches are used. These intermediate maps could be readable, though. Wouldn't that be a kick. Or it could move in stages. You could make a low quality map, then put it, ink, quil, and more sketches in, and try to make a higher quality map. Fail, and oops, there goes your map! Lot's of options here. As far as the zoning thing... well, I don't like it either, personally. So here's another idea, but it might be too difficult to implement. We still want to force the player to only work on one zone at a time, but allow them to go through other zones if need be. So (one way or another) we have to destroy the sketches from one zone to start mapping another zone. Well, let's say we do it this way. Let's say that you have to start a map layout type of sketch first. (This would be just vague outlines and showing the locations of the detail sketches in relation to each other and other landmarks IRL.) It would be simple, but large. So it would be something like, ink, quil, large parchment or skin. You hit combine and poof, "East Commons Map Layout" is created. We want to make sure it is in inventory every time a sketch is made, and it becomes an actual component for when you combine the sketches. (Probably the easiest way to make sure it's in inventory while sketches are created is to make it a component for each sketch attempt, but returned like the quil.) The key is that whenever you create a new Map Layout, it destroys any sketches you have (as well as any layout you may have). Plus you must be in the zone pertaining to the Map Layout you have. A much more complicated solution, but it would let you zone out, go to the bank or whatever, zone back in and continue mapping. I don't much like that one either, honestly. I think it would probably be better to make sketches vanish on zoning, but let cartogropher's make partial maps from just a few of the sketches, then combine those for the full map. Or go the quality levels way and make it easy to make the Low Quality map, then you add sketches to it to bring it up a level. (This would actually be fairly accurate as a real cartogropher would make a fairly vague map, then add in details in waves, the finest details would be the hardest to do, and would be last.) You might need different inks and/or different quils for each level as well. (Again, fairly realistic finer details require sharper points and smother flowing ink.) This also adds the possibility of having different cartogrophers pass a map around in order to finish it. The newbie cartogropher passes it to a friend who's skill is higher so that he can add in the details the lower level guy would fail on. Then you could make certain details class specific for secret/specialty maps. For instance a druid or a ranger could add interesting insights to certain maps. Iskar might be able to add interesting things to Kunark maps, and Barbarians might have some insights to add to maps of their native lands. As well, Dark Elves may choose to obscure maps of their home, and rogues may wish to secretly document certain things. A master fisher might add some details too, it need not be specifically race and/or class based, but skill as well. Of course, it would be practical to keep the number of specialty maps to a minimum to keep the item count low. One problem with maps is they will take up lots of inventory space. Even if you make maps of a single zone stackable (and I probably wouldn't just because I think that's the way Verant would go with it) there would still be at least one map for almost every zone. That is a whole lot of maps. If you get lemons make lemonaide I say... in other words. Allow master cartogrophers to make map books. Something like "The lands of Kunark". You would have to combine several HQ Maps, plus some other supplies (binding, cover material, book making stuff). Fail, and you ruin a bunch of GOOD maps, so I would make sure there were plenty of items to get your skill pretty high without even trying this. But, you are still going to loose some maps. Succeed, and you have a book. Each page you turn flips to the next map. If you made these light enough to carry, and they did have some gameplay effects (perhaps through enchanting) then I would imagine the books would be fairly rare and sell for quite a bit. Individual maps would be much more common, but you could only have so many before you started really wasting inventory space.<P>Even if it didn't make much profit, it would be a lot of fun. I also think it would actually make the game more fair. As is people with printers and/or multiple computers have a huge advantage over players that do not. The ability to look at reference material from websites while playing is invaluable. This wouldn't go away, but it would make available to those underpriveleged players the ability to consult a map without logging out of the game.<P>Okay, I'm sure there are tons of things I didn't think about, and there must be lots of other ways to do things. I just thought this stuff up on the spot, mostly. But, anyway, let's discuss it. Whether or not Verant ever does this, I had fun just coming up with ways they could. Hell, I'd voluntere to come up with the new item lists and new recipe's personally. I'd even wander around the zone's using the /loc command to set up tables for all the seperate areas manually. heh (They would have to give me a GM login to do it, my poor rogue would not survive!) Hey, I said I was crazy. Well, I'm sure that won't happen, just saying I'd do it is all.<P>BTW Sorry for bad grammar and/or spelling in this.

</FONT><HR>...You... Have one WILD imagination Mannon. First, you made some good points on cartography. While reading it I got confused on how you would make the sketches though, mind if you could try explaining it easier?<P>Also, if they did make cartography that dealt with pelts, people would be fighting over HQ pelts. Rare and also used for handmade packs which people want, so the prices would rise. If it is based on lvl: Let's say at lvl 30 you're able to make very good maps and will need HQ pelts, they would be fighting with the lower lvls, who're killing them for exp. Of course they could buy them, which I already said, would rise the price. I bet some would rather go kill them than pay. There are some areas where bears are rarely hunted too, so this arguement can go both ways.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Towards the end you kept destroying the arguements I was going to put in, like the maps taking up space and even if they were stackable. Anyways, I think the sketches should stay in your inventory. Hey, they're going to run out of space some time.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Also, there are some pretty big zones out there, what if one couldn't fit and if the image of the total map was made smaller to fit, it would make it harder to read. Plus if you made all of the maps into a book, the page sizes of the book are half(?) the size of a normal page. Of course the maps can take up two pages, but i even hate RL books that have that gap in between them. Some people will live with it maybe.<P>P.S. As Teema said, you should reduce your sugar and caffeine intake.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Caffeine bad for you? NNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Caffeine good, sleep bad.<P>Seriously though... (For some reason I can't believe I just said that.) I dunno, I'm hyped about this skill. I like it as a pure trade skill best. Everybody should have the ability to do it. Some classes probably should be better than others. hmmmm... How to do that, I'm not sure. Maybe there's just more specialty maps for certain classes. (Bards, Druids, Rangers, Rogues?)<P>Sketches are easy to make.<P>1 ink + 1 small piece of parchment (or whatever) + 1 quil = 1 sketch of the area you are in<P>As far as having them destroyed when you leave the zone, I don't like it either, but it would make it MUCH easier to implement. Think about it. EC scetches include stuff like; tunnel entrance, large room, first inn, mountain path, western trail, ruins, ect... Now in NRo you have; FIRST INN, TUNNEL ENTRANCE, docks, RUINS, first Derv camp, ect... So how often are these areas that would be sketches repeated in other zones? Well, if you keep your sketches when you zone then how do we know the Tunnel Entrance sketch in your inventory is from EC if you're mapping EC. We either have to create Unique sketch items for every tunnel entrance in the game or we destroy them when you zone. It's logistics. It's dozens of sketch items we have to create in the item database vs hundreds, or thoughsands. Not only that, we would have to create brand new sketches every time we added a new zone, so Vellious would have taken that much longer to make. If this item overhead is not a problem, then I wouldn't have a problem with the sketches remaining in your inventory. They would be named like, "Sketch of the Norther Ro Tunnel Entrance" or something similar but shorter, that's pretty verbose. "NRo Tunnel Entrance Sketch" *shrug*<P>I think the way we keep these from being a big problem, along with our ten slot kit problem is to have intermediate steps. Perhaps the Low Quality map requires only four sketches. The Medium Quality map might require the Low Quality Map and four different sketches... ect. Or the maps might be doable in areas. You might map half the zone at a time, then combine the halves. That way if you are forced to zone, before you have enough sketches, you only lost a couple sketches. (Unless you're sitting in the same spot making twenty sketches before you move on, but that's your fault IMHO.) If you're really not willing to lose the sketches, but get trained, die and loot them from your corpse. ;p Life in EQ is tough, but we gotta make the skill practacle to implement.<P>As far as pelts go, I would minimize the impact in many ways if they were to be used at all. First of all sketches could not be done on pelts or skins, only on certain sketch paper items, probably bought off NPC's. I'd probably make the low quality ink used in sketches also available from NPC's... Although it would be interesting if you make the same sketch with higher quality ink, it could yeild the same sketch, but be easier to make perhaps. So you could use NPC ink, but would have an incentive to get PC made ink. Using worse ink would be harder so it would have a higher triv, and thus be better for training early skill gains, but it would still triv pretty low for most sketches. (Some sketches being harder to make.) So anybody making sketches that are already trivial would have a pretty decent incentive to get PC ink since it would save them failures. Especially if NPC ink isn't too cheap, and is only sold by a few NPCs. I would also NOT require HQ pelts or skins. I'm a tailor, I know how rare those drop. I would use medium and/or low, and only for certain things. hmmm... I would prefer HQ maps use some kind of HQ parchment or some such, but would it be made or bought? Maybe we drop the pelts and skins all together, but then how do we get our parchments? We don't want everything storebought like jewel craft. I'll have to do some research on the making of parchment. Paper would be a bit high tech for Norrath, I think. Or, maybe not! Perhaps paper could be tinkered by those ingenious dwarves? Until then it's parchment, which I believe is just dried, streched, and cured? skins. Perhaps we could use lion skins and other such currently unused skins? I'm sure tailors would love to have a use for those. If we still can't think of ways to not impact the current skin/pelt market then perhaps drop rates could be increased to offset. (I bet tailors wouldn't mind that!)<P>I thought about the books having the crease in the middle. I don't see why we would have to have that crease. Think about how you would make an atlas out of these maps. We're talking parchment, rough stuff, and pretty low tech. You'd sew the left side of each map together, and put a cover on it. You aren't going to cut each map in half, and then put them back to back. So the real atlas would have a map on the right open page, and be blank on the left. Np, we only display the open one. Besides, I bet most old timey atlases like this folded the pages up instead of to the left. So it makes sense. Of course, if these were viewable in full screen mode we could make them big enough that detail wouldn't be a problem. If that isn't an option large zone may simply have to be broken into multiple maps.<P>PS. One of these days I will make games... then my sugar and caffeine addiction will be put to good use. Until then, I'm in training. mwahahaha! *lol*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My thoughts:<P>1) Maps should be a trade skill, available at lvl 1 to any player, like fishing.<P>2) Mapping should require that a quill be held in the primary hand (like a fishing pole), a "map" held in the secondary hand, and automatically use components (ink), just as bait is used when fishing.<P>3) A blank "map" is a simple piece of parchment.  Existing maps can be augmented to add detail for the area where the mapping occurs.<P>4) When a player hits the "map" key, a skill check occurs and the map is either improved (or not) for that area of the zone.  Failure should result in the loss of the map ("Your ink runs, rendering the map useless"), much like a failure in fishing results in a broken pole.  Not improving is not necessary a failure in this sense.<P>5) Maps should be trade-able, and not stackable unless bound into a book.  Binding should be a 1-time operation, like combining potions.<P>6) Only complete maps could be combined into books.<P>  Implementing cartography this way would be fairly easy to imlement as there are only as many items as there are zones, and each zone could have a fixed number of bits in the code for a completeness mask (the programmers know what I mean here).  The item database doesn't have to grow much this way, nor does the character database to keep track of the skill.  <P>  Some of the realism is sacrificed in this way, but a nice new trade skill is added for those that enjoy that sort of thing, and folks that just want to explore can see some pay off for that effort.  Guild could offer map books of different regions to junior guild members.  Lastly, we could see some standardization of place names by how the maps were implemented ("Derv camp #1" becomes something more in line with the roleplaying aspect of the game).<P>  My thoughts for what they're worth.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually it would take a lot of items, because you are adding details to the actual map, instead of collecting sketches. I meah a LOT of items, unless it was basically a map whole zone standing in one spot kind of thing. (Which is what I wanted to prevent with the sketches.)<P>Here's why. Let's say a zone has a meager five different areas to map. Simple huh? Grab quil, and parchment, stick ink in inventory, and wonder off to the area of your choosing. Map it, then go to next area, and map it, ect... ect... Well, when you succeed the map or parchment in your hand must first be destroyed, and replaced with a new map on your pointer. Let's say we map uhhh NRo. The areas are Docks, Inn, Tunnel, Desert, and flat (newbie area). That's pretty simplistic, even for NRo, but the example is five areas. You wonder into the flat (newbie area) from FP. Let's say you're damn a damn good cartogropher, and never fail. You hit map button and the parchment becomes a map of NRo with detail of the flat. So you click the map into your hand, and move to the inn. Poof map dissappears from hand, new one on pointer with detail of the flat AND the inn. Are you starting to see what I'm getting at? By trying to add details to the map one area at a time instead of a bunch at once you are creating tons of items. This progression of filling in the map must continue through each area. Not only that, but what if you mapped the inn first? So we must support the ability to map the zone one area at a time, in any order. To do that we must represent every possible combination of mapped and unmapped areas. Each area is eather mapped or unmapped, and is thus boolean. Since there are five areas that could be mapped or unmapped in any given map the total number of unique maps is equal to 5 squared. That's 25 unique maps for NRo alone, assuming it has a mere 5 areas to map! Now what if we want detail? Areas would include flat(newbie area), Tunnel, Dock, Plat, First Derv Camp, Second Derv Camp, Third Derv Camp, Ruins,  Trail, Druid Circle?. That's about all I can think of off hand. That's 10 areas. 10 areas does not mean twice as many unique maps as 5. Unique maps equals # of areas squared. 10 squared is 100! And this is merely one zone.<P>There's another issue I have with this method. It would require an ability button. There are only six ability buttons. That is not enough for all abilities. I'm a mere 19th level rogue myself. I have 9 abilities... (unless I forgot any) Hide, Sneak, Pick Pocket, Beg, Fishing, Sense Heading, Sense Traps, Bind Wound, and Pick Locks. Fortunately Bind Wound is also a Combat Skill, and Pick Locks doesn't require a button for me to use it. That still leaves me with 7 skills that require being set to an ability slot to be used. With only six slots, it's impossible to set up buttons for all of them simultaniously. I macro many of my skills together in socials, so what I do is switch out Sense Heading, and Sense Traps. The macros all use the "/doability" command, so whichever one is active in my sixth slot is the one that the macro runs. If Cartography becomes another ability, it complicates things significantly. I could still drop beg, but I like practicing it. (It's a skill, I want to raise it. I know it's worthless, and I don't care.) To switch out cartogrophy in all this I'll have to redo my socials. Currently I have a fishing macro that does fishing, beg, and sense heading/traps. If I replace beg with cartography I'm mapping every time I cast. That's not good. This only get's more complicated as more skills are opened up at higher levels. At some point I'll get disarm traps. I'll also get Disarm and Instill Fear, but I think those two are combat skills.<P>Personally, I'd rather have to deal with one more container, and have a fairly standard trade skill, than have to juggle my ability slots.<P>I don't mean to play dueling Cartogrophy schemes. By all means I want feedback and ideas for this. But, I feel I had to point out some potential flaws in your system.<P>I also have some minor gripes, that are merely my opinion, but I'll list them anyway. Your scheme requires equipping the quil and the map or parchment. Personally I dislike changing my equipment like that. It also means that you cannot equip any int or wis items in your hands to get a bonus. Also if you get attacked while making a map (and you will) you will have to equip your weapons before you can fight back. Also rogues would be unable to use this trade skill while hidden. I know this probably doesn't seem like much to nonrogues, but rogues can currently do ANY trade while hidden, including fishing, but this would remove an item from your primary hand. Modifying your equipped items in any way breaks hide.<P>One last thing. My system would be slightly less aggrivating. Here's why. Making the sketches would be the most difficult part. Making the actual map from the sketches wouldn't be quite as difficult. (Well, maybe the first actual map.) The point is that once you have a map, you have a chance to add too it, but you don't necessarily have to loose the map to have skill fails since skill fails will occur on the sketches individually. So making the sketches becomes the most difficult part of the process that adds most of the challenge. This means fewer useable maps will be ruined. Adding the details to the actual maps every time is a bit like if you had a chance to loose an entire suit of banded every time you tried to add another piece.<P>My system could also be crafted to greatly reduce the number of items needed. If you look it over, you could simplify cartography a bit to reduce items or add items and complicate it. It's actually pretty flexible. Here, let's use NRo as an example again. We wound up with ten distinct areas. (Just what I could think off off hand. There's also the little huts near the water, that would be eleven, but for the sake of comparison, let's keep it at ten.) Let's say we want to keep all these areas, and have maybe three quality levels of maps in progressive style. All the steps require the quil and ink, same as yours, so let's set aside that part. The LQ Map requires four sketches and a large piece of parchment. The MQ Map requires the  LQ Map and three more sketches. The HQ map requires the MQ map and three more sketches. In the process of making the HQ map we had once chance to loose the large parchment, we had once chance to loose the LQ map, and once chance to loose the MQ map. In your scheme we would have a chance to loose the parchment, then the map with one area, then the map with two areas, ect... for a total of ten steps which would force us to start over. However, creating the map in my scheme would require at least 13 skill attempts as opposed to your 10. Youre scheme would require no failures whatsoever until the map was finished (ten successes in a row!). Whil my sceme would allow for an infinate number of failures without requiring the cartogropher to start over after the LQ Map were made as long as the failure did not occur on the attempt to make the MQ Map. Furthermore I only require 13 unique items in the creation of the full HQ map, while your scheme requires 100. Not only that, but the ten sketch items are NOT unique to the zone, but are items shared with other zones as well, further reducing the total number of items needed. It is unfortunate that you loose sketches when you zone, but look at it this way. If you make the sketches in the right order, make the maps as soon as you have the sketches for them, and don't make duplicates, the most sketches you would loose would be 4. Even if you had a full set of sketches you only loose 10 sketches, which would be fairly cheap to make, anyway. The item savings would probably be worth the need to destroy sketches on zoning. It would also add a certain level of challenge to cartogrophy. (If you get chased out of the zone by a train it could be argued you would have lost the sketches in your panic anway. ;p )<P>Let me tack on something to my suggested scheme. I suggest there be a skill cap somehow or another based on level. (I can practically hear the boos of my fellows in the trades.) I know most trades do not cap, but let me explain. We do not want rogues, and casters with invis to be the ultimate masters of cartogrophy. If we do not cap the skill level, or place some other level based obstacle, then this will happen. Low level rogues and casters with invis will simply map themselves silly, then proceed to map high level dungeons that other classes of equal level and wealth would not be able too. I simply want to even the playing field a bit. A low level rogue with a capped cartogrophy skill, could still sneak into a high level dungeon, but would ultimately fail most or all attemts to sketch and/or map the zone. he or she would have to wait until his or her level were appropriately high enough to allow their skill to advance to the point that they could map it. This level should probably be very close to the same level a nonrogue and noninvising class player would be capable of mapping the zone. This would also prevent people from escorting low level cartogrophers into high level zones, just to get maps. (Not every cartogropher has a high level friend/guild to escort them into such zones, thus this helps make cartogrophy more fair.)<P>Okay, this cartogrophy thing is like a beast. My posts are now rediculously long! mwahahaha Oh well...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm...  a lengthy response.  I don't see that sketches are fundamentally any better than the scheme I proposed.  That's just an opinion of course, but one I'm entitled to.<P>There is a difference between "items" and detail.  Pelts are all generally the same item.  Because a pelt can't be both bear and cat, LQ and HQ, it requires fewer bits to save that data.  Only one graphic with different colors is required for all the various pelts.<P>In the case of maps, let's take 8 distinct areas of a zone.  That requires one byte of data to store.  If you had mapped areas 2, 3, and 5, it would look like this in the bit mask: 00010110<P>If there are less than 255 zones in the world (I have no idea off the top of my head), then you could keep track of those in the item database with another byte of data.  If they use the graphic for parchment (add scribbles for a map and track that with one extra bit in the data type), they wouldn't even have to add an item, just expand what they already have.  There are many, many book types, so adding another type is trivial.<P>Buttons vs containers, equipping vs not.  I don't really care which way they do it, but a button is the way they do fishing.  Like fishing, there is no reason you would *have* to break out of hide to map.  that is handled by a function call, which they have complete control over.  Would you be vulnerable to attack while mapping?  Yes, but then, what cartographer with his map spread out before him is ready to jump up and engage in battle.<P>No skill will ever be the way everyone wants it, but the scheme I described is eminently programmable with minimal effort and achieves many of the features you described.  I am a programmer, I can see how they might have programmed the other trade skills and modelled my suggestion on how I would probably implement this feature.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
