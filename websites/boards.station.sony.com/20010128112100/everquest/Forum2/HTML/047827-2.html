</FONT><HR>Eci is not any better.  There were just as many linkdeaths and lag bubbles tonight as there have been over the past few weeks.  It made our raid on the Overking in Chardok incredible difficult, and made the whole evening, not fun.  I dont think your new estimates for server size, especially in the Eci case are realistic.  It takes away from the fun of the game.  I, as a player, appreciate the attention you are putting in to look at the problem, but the time to look has passed, and it is time to act.<BR>Thanks<BR>Loch McCloud<BR>Grail Brotherhood<BR>Eci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aradune said:<P>Hi all,<BR>I wanted to bring up this issue officially and also talk about some aspects of it, and how we are looking to solve some of the issues.<BR>(end)<P>Great.  This has been a thorn in my side and I know it has bothered others.  It is good to see you are actually willing to communicate with us about it.<P>Aradune said:<P>First of all, we are working to come up with a new target server population at peak hours number. Our inclination at this point is a number somewhere between 2300 and 2500 players during peak hours. We feel we need to adjust this number because of how much Velious has added to EverQuest's size and quantity of content.<BR>(end)<P>This really doesn't make sense since you haven't qualified it.  Do you mean that by adding the Velious content you didn't add more horse-power to drive the server to cover the new zones/mobs/content, or does it mean that you did but not enough?<P>Aradune said:<P>We also feel that undercrowding is probably more detrimental to the game than overcrowding, in that while crowded areas are frustrating in that there is greater competition involved, there are some advantages to it (help from others when an encounter goes bad, help with CRs, etc.). (No, I'm not saying Overcrowding is good overall -- so please don't misunderstand me). Undercrowding, however, can mean a player can't find anyone to play with, and thus leaves. In other words, that frustration can be worse.<BR>(end)<P>I know many would disagree with you on this point.  In a real D&D exploration world there'd be much more enjoyment even if there are fewer people thus making certain aspects of the game more difficult.<P>This topic was discussed at length by your playerbase and I think much of the debate concluded with having regular server splits that are automatic to reduce the server populations to about 1500 per server.<P>Honestly, I can't see you having spent the correct amount of time analyzing the problem and the impact of splitting at 1500 ppl peak.  Think about it some time from the angle of what the impact would be.  I mean, actually sit back on your couch and close your eyes and think about it for some time.  Think about it from all perspectives and don't get stuck on one side of it--as it appears you have.<P>1)  fewer people making it harder to get groups, yes.<P>2)  smaller groups using their abilities to a much greater extent.  People would just have to become better players.<P>3)  Less inflation.<P>4)  Item valuation would stay high even for some of the mid level items.<P>5)  Players would become more tight knit.  They would be force to socialize more.  Players that were problems would more readily be identified and either shepherded into the correct behavior or would be shunned from the server.<P>6)  More dungeon crawl would be happening.  Players would be able to actually explore.  With high server populations players don't do any type of exploration because all zones are known, all spawns are known, and all loot drops are known and/or are readily available.  Information about these things would enter the worlds through the internet web page distribution system at a slower rate.  This will happen due to servers wanting to keep things secret longer.  Guilds such as FoH won't release information about where things were dropping and what it took to get there because they could have pride in knowing their guild on their server has this unique knowledge.  The more the server population grows the more the information is distributed.  People tell more people even those not close friends.  With dungeon crawl more in affect players would be less likely to disemminate this type of information because they want to come back and dungeon crawl.<P>7)  This game isn't a role playing game due to the fact of server over-crowding.  In the early days of the game play people actually tried to RP.  This was because there were so few and the effort was much less involved.  You could RP and make friends.  EQ can't be Everquest with the server populations the way they are.  Actually even at 1500 peak time EQ can't be Everquest.  It certainly isn't the EQ I thought I was buying.  I chose EQ over the other MMORPGs because it was supposed to have a more RP-like aspect to it.  It was supposed to be a quest based game.  To me that meant:  go and build relationships amongst the few and far between villages and players, go and find the dungeon and explore it and learn about it, it meant that I would be playing an RP game with exploration and questing at the heart of it.<P>This didn't happen to me (even though I started at the beginning, when the servers were first opened to the public), because populations grew so quickly (due to so few servers to select from).<P>Aradune said:<P>There have also been some problems with packet loss and link death, specifically on E'Ci, when populations are growing high.<P>(end)<P>This isn't the only server.  Just sitting on line with a regular modem causes increased game crashes and other issues due to the fact that to do anything, in the area of eqic quests, planes, major guild events, requires 40+ people in the same area and it pushes the throughput of these modems to the max causing lots of problems.<P>I can guarantee you that this is the case.  I moved to an area that doesn't have cable modem access.  Prior to this I was in an area that offered it and I had one and I never ever crashed.  Even after all the patches for Velious, etc I never crashed.  After moving and being forced to use a modem my game crashes much more frequently, but ONLY when I'm in big events with the guild where 40+ ppl are in the same zone area.<P>If I sit alone outside of karnors and pick off the random blue con spawn I am able play all day without any type of crash interruption.  But the moment I get into a big guild event I crash with great frequency.<P>I am a computer technician and have worked in the computer field for 15 years on both hardware and software and I am trained to notice unusual contributing factors.  I wouldn't be successful unless I was able to do this.<P>This is truly an indication of a problem with the programming in your game.  The game should never crash you out to the Windows Desktop even if you have connection issue, bad connection, corrupted and resent data.  The game should be robust enough to handle almost all of the problems associated with bad connections.<P>I know, due to the problems I just described that you could solve many problems with this game by just working on how you recover from connection issues such as bad data, corrupt data, etc.<P><BR>Aradune said:<P>So, what are we going to do about all of this? <BR>Well, before launching new servers we're going continue to analyze where players are at, what zones are crowded, and what zones are underused. Significant experience bonuses are going in next patch for underused zones (mostly dungeons). <BR>(end)<P>This is somewhat disingenuous.  Here's why.  The problem that this address is the low to mid level game play.  It doesn't address the high level game play.  If you look at the list of proposed zones that will receive the higher ZEM you will see that they are in the 15-30 range.  Also, the increases aren't dramatic.<P>The one zone for the higher level players, The Hole, is very buggy.  It has big problems with certain spells and pathing is about as horrid as it can get down there.  That is just to name a few.  Can't you guys fix the zones before you begin to entice more people into them?<P><BR>Aradune said:<P>With E'Ci specifically we found out that after a recent hardware change, the network interface was incorrectly configured -- last night this was fixed, so please tell us if anything has improved.<BR>(end)<P>Great job, but you let us know.<P><BR>Aradune said:<P>Also, when there are network problems out there with the Internet and a large group of players go link dead, this can cause zones to go down. We are working on this issue as well.<BR>(end)<P>If the zones crash due to massive player LD then something is very wrong with the game code.  I hate to say it, but this just doesn't answer the problem with server crowding.  It isn't even on point.<P>Aradune said:<P>So, there you have it, both gameplay and hardware solutions we hope will have significant effect. And please understand that any hesitation to launch new servers is due to undercrowding fears only -- if after these adjustments and attempts to better utilize all the zones we have it turns out target populations are lower than we believed, we will launch new servers, both split and new.<BR>(end)<P>Please don't fear undercrowding.  If you have a problem with servers being under-crowded then don't introduce any for a while.  Otherwise, just introduce new servers everytime there's more then 2000 players peak on any server.  That'll solve alot of problems for everyone.  Undercrowding is more of an excuse not to split then it is an attempt to resolve real issues.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ECI -<P>Still way broken.  Horrible lag spikes all day long.  My machine locked during casting spells.  Impossible to mem stuff during a 28 person raid.<P>Raid wipeout out twice from gaters.  We had stunners of course, but didn't help.  Sever moved as normal place while we attempted to stop the gaters.  Rotten rotten evening.  Several times we would loose 1/3rd of the raid to LD.  And not to mention it typical CR time.<P>The network connection is not fixed.  Complaints about Lag and LD deaths are being answered by the Guide staff as /feedback for a split .. if they recieve hundreds of requests they will have to split.<P>The simple fact is, no where in the game is safe from the zone crashing.  ECI needs to be upgraded, replaced, or split.  It's one of the oldest servers in the game, and it it cannot handle the 2600-2900 server load.<P>ECI also is an international server with a heavy heavy game load at all hours during the day.  It's the unofficial Pacific Rim server, and people from all over the world are using it.<P>Would be nice if you had SEVERAL designated international servers.<P>Please fix ECI or split it.  It's still an issue.<P>Iklyn Woodchuck</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Player distribution is based on risk vs reward, correct? The game contents a component which allows players to modify the risk factor - the cleric. The formula for risk then becomes one of availability of the modifier device, and in EverQuest a component of this formula is distance.<P>Ensuring a distribution and spread of players, then, is going to require /ensuring/ the distribution of clerics. A zone where high-level, full-exp rezzes are available has a negligible risk factor, regardless of the rewards; Example, Karnors. A zone where obtaining even a low-level rez can be difficult if you didn't bring a cleric has an much higher risk factor; Examples, PermaFrost, Split Paw.<P>I'm based in the UK, my "peak" playing time is when the daily camps and spawns are just being set out - it's a very good time for a newly formed group to set out and hunt, because stuff is generally uncamped.<P>The distribution of clerics in the afternoon is the KEY factor to what will be camped and where people will be in the evening.<P>I've seen rants by rangers, paladins, druids and bards about starting up groups. It is hard for ANY class to start up a group without being able to say "Yes we have a cleric". People aren't interested.<P>If you want folks to inhabit SplitPaw beyond initial curiosity factor, you need to provide that clerics will be available there; that people running from the Karana's will be able to get a Rez.<P>Maybe it sounds like I have a grudge against clerics; I don't per se. I am tired of seeing people focused on building a balanced group of 5 with the 6th slot reserved for a "rez person", not a cleric. <P>K</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Indeed, there is a central box that tracks movements between zones, but if there are 3,000 people on a "server"; as long as 1000 of you are in "old world," a thousand or so in Kunark, and the remainder in Velious, the machine load remains low.<P>Revamping zones to s...p...r...e...a...d out the population ~does~ reduce server-side congestion issues.<P>You'll notice this often when 4-5 zones go down at the same time.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Personally, I believe that overcrowding is not the problem.  The problem is that because of overcrouding on the servers pre-expansion, people developed the attitude that you should be able to walk into a zone, find a group, and fight there.  With the addition of the patches, this is not the case.  In the better zones, (the hole, 3/4ths of velious, CoM, etc), you must take your own group.  But people have become so accustomed to walking into guk and Yelling for a group, they will do it for hours rather than get a group of friends to go to another zone.<P>Honestly, I'd like to see lguk stop spawning when 60+ people enter.  I know this isn't reallistic, but it gives an idea.  The servers can EASILY support 2500 people comfortably if people spread out, but this is hard to cause.  Verant is being very gracious and positively incouraging us to move to the less used dungeons rather than doing things like nerfing guk to 1/2 the spawns, or reducing rare drops in SolB to 10% or turning the exp bonus in Oasis to .1%.  If we don't like the crowding, it is our job as players to create the friend networks to spread out to the better zones.<P>We should be more than thankful of Verant for putting in the positive inticement, rather than pointing out to use the fact that we are the idiots that won't use all the great zones they have put in.  Just take a look at phin up close, or walk though Nurga, or look at the wedding scene in Shadow Tower.  These are beautiful scenes, and everyone would enjoy the game much more if we turned particles up, and moved from zone to zone rather than sat in one zone.<P><BR>. . .

</FONT><HR>I'd just like to make a remark about the low server population. Though it may be harder to find a group with a lower population, it's all relative. A Paladin or SK may be passed over by a group because they are waiting for a Warrior, who they feel can tank better. With a relatively high population server this is common. But, as they were designed, a hybrid can fill spots in groups that would other wise be filled the the most apropriate class on a large pop server. Basically, a low population actually makes it _easier_ for a hybrid to get a group then a large population.<BR>Kerv. lvl 50 n00bas gimp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Right problem WRONG FOCUS!  READ THIS!<P>Your problem is not overall server population, 2500 would not be so bad if they were not all lumped in so very few zones.  <P>Your problem is specific area population!  I'd say if you polled your servers, you would find that 80% of the players can be found in 20% of the zones.  That is a major problem that you need to fix.  Look at your more popular zones and see what is there and why people like it and fix the others accordingly.<P>Upping the ZEM is not going to help some zones.  They just need to be redone.  Please let the people who are doing the refurbish of the old dungeons take a good look at the Kunark dungeons like Kurn's.  Aside from the pathing these dungeons are excellent!  They are not mob level and number advancing till the $hit hits the fan type death dungeons that the old dungeons are.  They are well done and fun.

</FONT><HR>Aradune, there is one little issue that should be considered when dealing with overcrowding.<P>"Balanced" distribution of players in every zone must take into account the average level of the players.  Players do not de-level(well, not most of the times :P) and thus everyone is getting higher and higher in levels.  This causes a HUGE influx of players to the high level zones, whereas the lower level zones will become  underutilized.<P>The ratio of high to low level players need to be considered.  The fact of the matter is, many high level players are making twinks simply because there aren't enough places to fight at higher levels.  Velious as an expansion greatly enhances EQ as a whole, but Velious has one HUGE weakness and that is the fact that it can't be done decently without HUGE raid groups, as well as the faction problem(it's a great idea, but it limits the amount of players in certain dungeons, and that needs to be taken into account while considering server population).<P>It seems to me nowadays that most people are either concentrated in outdoor zones or Sebilis/Karnor/Lower Guk/Solusek B.  Chardok and Howling Stones are underused high level zones that nevertheless become "packed" ONLY because Sebilis and Karnor is full.  Kael Drakkel, Necropolis, and Skyshrine are often raided by high level guilds(to my knowledge), but the Hole, Siren's Grotto, and Temple of Veeshan are empty most of the times.  The lack of good exp zones in Velious greatly hampers the "it should expand the amount of players per server" theory, in addition to the "more players, more lag" problem that already exists.<P>There are definite problems to the zones that are under utilized, and I'm afraid the solution of making exp go faster in them is not going to be, in the long term, the "best" solution, especially with zones that are perceived as great, balanced zones(Chardok, CoM, HS), but have serious problems that hamper players.  I'll briefly list them.<P>Chardok: Lack of named spawns, lack of variety(there are mostly only two models in this zone: golems and sarnaks)<P>City of Mist: Lack of named spawns before reavers(which require raids not normal groups), trains involving bad pathing from mob from the sky, bad placement in the world(Emerald Jungle is a very difficult place to get to)<P>Howling Stones: Takes forever to get NORENT keys(requiring a rogue to do 90% of an exp dungeon is NOT a good idea), unbelievably large population of mobs, many sks, requiring more than one typical group, bad placement in the world requiring invis and hard-to-get key, bad faction for evils<P>Kaesora: bad placement for majority(not iksars though), bugged pathing, too many casters(including clerics that heal from out of nowhere), simply no reason to go to for the level(which is 30-40, which so many other mid level dungeons serve better)<P>Nurga: Lack of named spawns, too small a dungeon, lack of loot or incentives(but I think the exp bonus might change this)<P>Droga: Arrgh... Lack of spread out named spawns, lack of variety, too many casters, goblin swarm heaven(too hard for one appropriate leveled group), too hard to navigate<P>Kerra: The quests suck, overpowered mobs, lack of good loot(comparable loot to Sol A/CT would give lots of players incentive to come)<P>Permafrost: Goblin swarm galore, healers out of nowhere, too small of a level range<P>Solusek A: Too many farmers :P<P>I think Verant knows what makes a good exp dungeon.  The most important goal of a good dungeon is to keep the players interested not bored to death(hence, more variety in mob abilities, named spawns, etc.), and the second goal is to compensate the players for going into a hard place(decent loot, great exp, or both).  A good dungeon, in order to be highly utilized, requires a huge spread of levels.  For example, Lower Guk can be used for levels 30-50+.  That's one reason why SO MANY PEOPLE are in Lower Guk, because it supports a wider spread of people.  Lower Guk also have an even "flow" that I think is VERY important in a dungeon.  The mobs start easy, and gets harder the deeper you go.  It's not like Splitpaw where you can have level 20 and level 30 monsters spawn at the same spot, making it almost impossible for groups to fight anywhere but the zone.<P>The flow of a dungeon is something I want to continue discussion of, but I'll refrain from doing it in this thread.  Maybe another thread  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You want us to spread out... one word!<P>PORTS!<P>What were you thinking when you decided to add an expansion and make the port spell drops so rare or hard to get that few have them?<P>What where you thinking when you left out a port location on the west part of the origianl world near surefall... a major starting point for druids with no port location?<P>What were you thinking when you made one port location on the entire continent of Kunark?<P>I see that you are thinking about allowing binds in more zones. What will this do for moving around when zones are overcrowded? What good is being able to bind near underutilized zones do when you log in and find them too crowded? Without being able to get a close port to some of these places they will ALWAYS be underused!<P>It takes almost an hour to organize any raid in kunark because of only having one port in location. I still see no common sense reason (roleplaywise) to have to port into DL, run across that zone, zone into Karnors and evac to another zone.<P>For my easy solutions.<P>1. Add a druid ring near Surefall. Should be one there anyway. You already have an undead type ring in Qeynos Hills that can be used so you would not have to change zone geometry if that is a problem.<P>2. Make the evacs in kunark to Emerald Jungle and Skyfire NOT have to be used in a dungeon. This would help alot. That silly run from DL port ring to Karnors is stupid and while I'm at it... any reason while the entire section in the port area of the dreadlands (besides the abandoned city) has zero... yes zero mobs?<P>3. While making us visit a velious zone before we can port there is a nice idea, why hold the port spells hostage and why have a dragon guarding one make one of the port locations useless?<P>I'm all for revamping dungeons but if you look at the most popular zones... it's not being able to bind that makes them popular, it's the proximity to a port location. <P>For exmaple... if you make it so a non-caster can bind outside Perm... would this help... maybe but the run to Halas is not that far so people bind there. It's the long long run from the karana port location that makes this zone not used. The real problem is that people do not want to run somewhere for an hour and when they get there find out that the zone is either overcamped or they cannot get a group and then have to run all the way back. A closer port location solves this.<P>Thanks for listening.<BR>and BTW....

</FONT><HR>Overcrowding is far, far worse than undercrowding.  I'm a former Test player, and even on Test with only 400 players I never had a problem finding a group.  When there are less people overall, then people are more inclined to invite you into a group.  Why?  Because places are more dangerous with less people, so people band together.  Also there are enough spawns to feed a group as much as they want.<P>Overcrowding causes lag, linkdeath, player disputes, farming/ebaying (more people = larger ebay market), lists, etc..  People don't like to form larger groups because everything is hunted so there aren't enough spawns to make a larger group as XP efficient as a small group.<P>I'm very disappointed with the population targets.  2500?!?  I now play on Tholuxe Paells, the 2nd newest server, and already it is overcrowded with peaks of 1900.  We lag out badly several times per night.<P>This is the most disappointing and upsetting news to come out of Verant in a long time.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aradune,<P>I still think you're missing the point about underused dungeons. 10-20% exp modifier increases isn't suddenly going shift populations into under-used zones. The under-used zones are simply badly-designed from a gameplay point of view. The risk vs reward is simply not as good as the more popular areas, 10-20% exp increase isn't enough. You need to re-examine the design of these places.<P>Most of the listed places to get increased bonuses have a common trait of lots of fast-spawning mobs usually with a lot of casting mobs thrown in. This is a recipe for group-death and 10-20% exp bonus isn't going to off-set that. Neither is putting more items there really as they'll just get farmed by high level players. You just have to re-tune the dungeons and reduce the difficulty in a lot of them, especially places like the Hole which are way out of way and don't get pick-up groups.<P>I'm also very disappointed with the list of zones to be given additional bonuses. They are all low-mid level dungeons - why? Create yourself a lvl 52 char and spend a week trying to advance. Where do you go? Pretty much one place - Karnor's. If you're lucky a Sebilis group may start up but more than likely you'll be sat on your butt /ooc'ing for a group. It's pathetic it really is.<P>When SoV came along I though - great! Surely they'll put in a couple more areas like Karnor's where lvl 50+'s can get pick-up groups. But not, I know of not one zone in SoV that you can just turn up to and try and get a good 6-person lvl 50+ group going. Basically you dropped the ball with SoV. You knew you had to give the increasingly-high level server population a fresh challenge and designed a lot of zones the are basically raid(guild)-only places. But at the same time you failed to realise that a significant portion of time for lvl 50+ players isn;t spent raiding, we need exp to get to 57+ where we can finally be useful in high level encounters. Only there is still basically only Karnor's to go so the increasingly large high-level population is crammed into the place.<P>At the same time those of us able to solo places like Skyfire and Raptors are vilified by people forced to sit and wait in Karnors (I played a paladin to 53 and now a necro to 54 so I know both sides). But to all those who haven't solo'd Skyfire - IT SUCKS! The only saving grace is we have a method of obtaining exp when we can't get a group. But that exp comes at high risk, little reward and high downtime. Skyfire is simply the lesser of two evils and that is poor game design.<P>What do we need? More walk-in/walk-out (i.e. not one way, keyed dungeons like Sebilis) like Karnor's where stuff is blue to 50-55's at or near the zone line. They have to be huntable by 4-6 person groups (of 50+) and not be tuned so badly they are filled with bad-pathing, insanely fast spawning, magic resistant casting mobs. They need to be balanced - that's not the same as making them easy.<P>I applaud your intentions with these recent changes but, to me at least, you seem to still be missing the point. You've basically abandoned the 50+ 6-man group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sigh, a lot of you are totally totaly wrong here - and it really pains me to see these posts because you are giving verant a totally wrong opinion.<P>Sure, if you put 200 people in one zone that zone gets very laggy and unplayable, there is no debating that.<P>HOWEVER<P>Total server population is a HUGE HUGE issue, NOT just zone population.  <P>Come on guys, I know most of you who post here have been playing for quite a while.  Go on the servers that even have only 2100 or so players on them.  Go into a zone with only 5-10 people in it.  Unless you live in los angeles with a cable+ connection, you will STILL have 15-20% packetloss constantly, even though there are very few people in the zone.<P>On lanys its very simple.  If the population goes to 1800 lag begins to increase.  PL is only 0%-5% so its not much of an issue, at all.  If the population goes to 1900 you're looking at 5-10% PL.  Things start to get messy and certain raids are off limits.  Once population gets to 2000 everyone has 25% PL making a whole lot of raids completly impossible.<P>I dunno, maybe this is just a lanys problem.  But on lanys, I can log on and do "/ all count" to determine if we're going to have mass LD on our raids - i.e. if we're going to have any fun that day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There are several issues you need to consider if you are raising the population target on the servers:<P>- Item entry rates.  Does it still make sense to have an item enter at the same rate as it does now, with 50%+ more people on the server?  There's still only the same source of Journeyman's Boots (and a SoW potion with a casting time isn't the same thing). There's still only the same source of the FBSS (although you have added more haste items to the game, thank you).<P>- Big Game Hunt encounters.  Does it still make sense to have these creatures spawn once a week when there are 50% (or in the case of some older servers, 100%) more people who want to hunt them?<P>- Server Demographics.  A server target of 2200 people means a very different thing if 50% of the people logged in are over 45th level, than it does if only 25% of the people logged in are over 45th level.  This relates to both item entry rates and big-game-hunt encounters.<P>- Encouraging social ties.  While undercrowding may make it initially harder for your average person to get a group, it definitely encourages people to make friends and keep them.<P>I have the feeling you are basing a lot of your decisions on the recent poll asking "how do you usually play EQ".  I answered, and I would suspect the plurality of people answered "In a group of people that I do not know."  Please allow me to clarify that.<P>Most of the time I'm playing, I don't know most of my group.  But I remember people I group with, and often times I am invited and/or invite someone to my group on the sole basis that I grouped with them before and had fun.  So while several of the people in my group are "whoever happened to be there", I usually have friends in my groups.  And if I don't start with friends in my group, by the time I leave, I've usually made at least one--isn't that why we are playing a social game?<P>--<BR>Kiatha Kittenpaw<BR>Feir`Dal Ranger<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Ok, i'm sure it will not go un-used, but maybe theres is other zones which fun-factor rely on higher level groups killing NPC's that otherwise quickly can mean you only have the memories of fun.<P>...after a few weeks of memories, no amount of fun is gonna make up for lack in advancement.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What i find strange (don't blame me, i may be just a little lucky) is that a lot of people complain about lag. True, once in a while i experience lag myself (on Innoruuk) but this is so rare that i can play easily with a 33k6 modem. PL is rarely above 3% with population being above 2200 at that time. <P>Could it have something to do with the ISP that is being the hookup for RATHE and E'CI ?<P>I know that Innoruuk rarely has any real devastating problems with lag although zoneovercrowding may cause this at special occations.<P>Also i would like to point out that a server is not located at just one server. Knowing a little about hardware, databases and other stuff makes me estimate a single server for each zone, which can explain why some zones have more lag then others (less memory, slower CPU, little different setup, you name it).<P>Overal i think that (in general) 2500 people (i am not talking about the problems that can occur when big raids are going on) should be possible, but i guess that for some servers the limit is a little different. For 2500 people the ISP connection of the server needs to be very good, as well as a good and stable server (hardware and config) environment.<P>All in all i think Verant needs a genuine Tweaker that endulges himself in getting the best out of every system  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>BTW, the proposed changes to the XP system make me smile, it sure is going to be easier to level now (okay, haven't reached 50 yet)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bazzek, 30 Warrior on Innoruuk<BR>Galaden, 20 Shaman on Innoruuk<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am afraid I am at a bit of a loss following the logic of this idea.<P>On the one hand we have:<BR>Experience modifiers turned up in the other zones should encourage people to spread out, have more fun, and allow those staying behind in other areas to have more fun themselves since the area is less crowded.<P>...from Brad in one post. And then turning around and stating that it is better to have more people per "server" (better named a data feed line as each "Server" as people know them, is a pineline to a "bank" of servers for various assigned zones).<P>Spreading people out throughout the "Server" into the various "sub-servers/zones" (no matter which one) does not resolve the issue of excessive data flow being the source of the problem (along with bad coding, but that's another issue).<P>Some "sub-servers/zones" will recieve packet loss through this excessive data rate. Multiply it for each "sub" and add the coding problems, and the entire situation rapidly spirals out of the realm of acceptable to a customer base.<P>As a customer I pay to use a service (play) provided by Verant. Over time, this service has become unavailable for a variety of "reasons" (read, excuses) put forth by the company. I expect this from every company I deal with on a daily basis, "It's not our fault."<P>I do not post often as I am well aware of the futility of trying to change Verant's lack of quality customer service. This situation of the left hand disagreeing with the right hand when the company itself is aware of its own hardware/software issues is completely laudable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I remember starting a character there in march or may 2000, and had to stop playing there because there was always packet loss, much more than on other servers. That's with cable modem. I've played on many servers and I can tell you that it's not the same at all.
