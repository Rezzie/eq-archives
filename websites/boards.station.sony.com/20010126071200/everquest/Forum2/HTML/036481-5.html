</FONT><HR>OK, I understand the need for a name policy. Bloodyvagina (as someoen mentioned earlier) is obviously not a name that should be in a game with kids. I just wanna point out though, all the creative and smart names in EQ infringe somehow on the naming policy. Take for example your OWN name Absor...someone mentioned that it is a form of drill and such..so go and change it cause it offends me..I have nightmares from boot camp of mean people making me do the Absor. <P>VI changing Karns, Grogsmash etcs names is only gonna end up making this game less interesting with a lot of Uladienads (suppose to be a name) walking around. Why not embrace the fact that some folk actually have some creativity in creating there names. <P>Oh, and PLEASE dont give us that BS about how proper names highten the RP environment...if you wanna highten the RP environment do away with Xteaming and such.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Curve, why spend so much time insulting other people, especially when you know nothing about them?  You are correcting their posts as if this is an English class.  You act like you are all high and mighty with you supposed ability to write well.  You don't seem to understand that this is extreamly informal writing and punctuation, correct grammer, etc. is not needed.  You also wrote on how these people must be teens.  I took this very personally as I am sure many other teens did.  I know nothing about you, but keeping in line with the way you act, I will tell you who you are, just like you told the others who they are.  You are an older slob, somewhere in your thirties, with nothing better to do but write for hours on end about a typo that someone made.  You assume that all youner people are jerks, probably because you were and still are picked on by them, or because you are continually out-smarted by someone twenty years younger than you.  You don't understand that this is a game and dread the thought of going out into the real world each day.  The only time you feel ok is when you are sitting in front of your computer, playing your lvl 60 charactureS that you spent Months and months of actual playing time on to build,and making fun of other players because you somehow think you are superior.  But than again, I know nothing about you, so who am I to make this criticism, right?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As mentioned in earlier posts, the naming rules specifically use Karn as an example of a forbidden name.  This is a lengthy thread, so I may have missed Karn addressing that fact.  If he hasn't, I would like to see him do so.<P>Also, it isn't VI that is MAKING Karn quit...Karn is quitting of his own volition.  He is free to decide what to do...not like he is being banned from the game.  If he chooses to quit due to a forced name change, then it is, in fact HIS decision.  I like the game enough that I would not choose to quit over a name change, but I understand that others may not like it as much.<P>Ralfi Widdershins, Cleric, Brell server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Its as if the Verantites make up policy as they go along, depending on their mood and if its one of their buddies or not wanting a nice name. Dusk T'Dawn, China, Ohmuhgawd are all good names, and NOT covered in the policy as written. IF YOU WANT TO INCLUDE PHONETICS, THEN PUT IT IN THE POSTED RULES. I stand by my assesment.

</FONT><HR>After reading this, I'm starting to feel it's required that you do a week of research before finalizing your handle if you plan to keep it, including (but not limited to) google.com searches, encyclopedias, dictionaries, phone books and correspondence with VI.<P>It's impossible for someone to be omnipotent, and if the name seems creative, let them keep it.  I know full well the origin of one of my names (this handle).<P>But I personally don't know if there is any deep meaning behind 'Raedron', my mage on TV.  It vaguely sounds like 'radon'...but that's all I could come up with.  That never even entered my mind when I thought of it.  All I was thinking was..."How can I use 'ae' in a name and make it sound good?"<P>I would be slightly miffed if that character incurred the wrath of the guides struck down from above.<P>I'm also starting to get worried about my well-being in the future.  My highest character's only 13 and I'm having doubts about ever getting this game.  I love it, nerfs and all.  I enjoy my alternate universe away from college.  Here I am, shelling out my hard-earned $10 per month to take part in this, nievely believing I won't have too many problems, but if this is what can happen to me, I wonder how VI will ever keep EQ going.  If lots of high levels quit over abuses of power and CS reps not following the guidelines (which, I think, should be placed on an easel right on their monitor...) I think this would, in turn, scare off VI's target audience.<P>I stuck out the Mystere incident and bought EQ.  I had my doubts then.  My doubts have not been alieved.  If this is the path that EQ is taking, as much as I would hate to do it, I might just quit myself.  I can stand the nerfs.  I can stand the patches.  Those, while directly affecting gameplay, I usually can end up living with.  It's the idea that VI's CS staff includes people who enjoy power a *bit* too much that worries me.<P>Sure, I see dumb names.  See them all the time.  (One curse about being in the newbie zones a lot   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )  I ignore them.  Why?  If they're real newbies and really interested in the game, they'll end up making a new (read: better) character later.  If they're dip*bleep*s, it will be displayed in their playing and they will be helped accordingly.  Full details of thought processes withheld due to lack of urge to type them, but that's mostly it for me.<P>As to my thoughts on Karn and Preecha, regardless of whether or not they break the rules (now...) I still consider it another RED mark on VI's customer approval sheet.  The fact they weren't given a chance to say anything about it and CS did as they pleased should take greater hold than any violation of policy incurred by the player.  It is the company's right and policy to stand by their guidelines regardless of the incident.  Do I think their names should be changed?  That's not for me to decide.  But it should not also be solely up to CS either (with the rules 1-3 exceptions).  It is supposed to be between the CS rep and the player.  For those cases, there is no situation (I saw) in the rules that gives the CS rep unilateral authority to perform whatever punishment deemed fit.<P>As to the name filter, it does work sometimes.  My friend a few weeks ago was making a joke gnome and tried to name it Beyotch.  Went through 12 different spellings before it accepted something.  However, once in game, my friend was contacted by a GM and informed (politely, I gathered) that the name violated policy and had to be changed.  THAT is how things should be done.  While I admit it's less severe than getting a L60's name changed (I'm only L13 and I know how important a name can be) it at least displayed the right process from VI.<P>Just my 2cp...ok, more like 4cp and a tattered cloth sandal, but anyway...gotta go write that research paper on my next character's name!<P>--Volante<P>Raedron, L13 Mage, TV</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, Absor ect<BR>  Im sorry.. you are WRONG!<BR>I usually agree with almost everything you guys post.. and being a wizard. thats saying alot..<BR>But on this issue you are soooo wrong<BR>  Everquest is no more than the sum of its parts...<BR>  It is the people who make it and the people who play it.  It seems to me that none of the changed names are offensive or over the edge...<BR>  To values something so periphial as non offensive names over people who are not only loyal customers.. but an intergral part of a community are not the actions of a company that cares about the people who use its product.<BR>  I think you have slapped the face of people who have a part, a small part albiet, but a part non the less of the enormous success that you have had.<BR>  If these people were new to the game or even lowbies... and these names were seen as against the spirit of the game.. then fine... but level 60 is far to late.. these people are parts of the community and have built a "name" for themselves based on their actions, good or bad.<BR>  You are wrong in this case.. please reconsider<P>BTW ..  I was gonna use examples of friends names that I play with... but Im kinda scared to now..  I shouldnt feel like that.. please dont create this kind of enviorment<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><P>Imagine the scenario plz:<P>Guy picks a name on a new game he gets, and begins to play. He meets hundreds(maybe  thousands) of people throughout his days.A year and a half later he has built up a name for himself. When friends see this name in the zone they say hello and such. When enemies see it they cringe, or perhaps get excited and go hunting for him(in pvp servers). I cannot express to you enough what a name is to some players! Ask gordon, who I believe is Tolan on some server, if he likes his name that is now legendary because of the armor. Then ask him if he would like to have his name changed to something else completely . Afterall, it is the same name as an armor in the game.......<P>None of this makes sense to me. Karn had his name LONG before the spell "mark of karn", most likely has more time played than Tolan himself, and now it is "Arntemp"....No warning either, just a swift change and now he is Arntemp. That is the worst customer service I have ever witnessed and your response to it was EVEN WORSE Absor!

</FONT><HR>OK I have only read the first page of 5 so this may have already came up. <P>Gordon always says that one reason that they will not move people between servers outside /movelog is that people have to live with the reputations that they have earned. <P>Now don't you think a player over level 40 certainly 50-60 has a reputation throughout the server and is known on the server because of their reputation.  <P>I am sure a lot of people get in groups because of the reputation that they hav earned and making them change their names that late in their EQ life is basically destroying their reputation.  <P>Sure their guild may know they have changed names but to let a whole server know that the awesome puller/tank/nuker named "Johndoe" is "Joeblows" would take a lot of time and possibly hurt his enjoyment of the game. <P>I think their should be a grandfather clause so that if a character makes level 40 his name can't be changed unless it is vulgar or offensive to a religion or something.  I don't think most people create these kinds of names and if so then they deserve to be changed. <P>Again you speak that players have to live with their reputations yet in one foul swoop you take that reputation away from them.<P>Think about it<P>Kodo</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

He deserves respect.<P>How come Verant let someone use a name during 60 levels and at some point decide to change it. This makes no sense.<P>Okay, Karn Age means "carnage". So what? How is this offensive to anyone. When you cast a level 49 AE spells on EC orcs, isn't it a carnage? Why can't we use a name that is related about what we can do in EQ. I repeat: "carnage" is not offensive.<P>I have seen a player that created a char named "labellepipeuse". I won't give the translation here but this one is really against rules and has nothing to do in EQ. <BR>As French people (and German, Italian and such) can use very offensive names that most players will never understand.

</FONT><HR>I have never posted on a board before, but i simply cant stand to not say something.i just dont get it i guess, call me silly but what gives people the right to complain about someone elses name ? i mean what difference does it make ? if i see someone that has a name i dont like, thats my problem, if i dont like it i wont look at it. this reminds me of the legal case back in the late eighties i think it was about the 2live crew albem...a bunch of holyrolling freaks got all upset about music they would never have listed to or even bothered with, yet they felt compelled to ***** and moan about how offensive it was when all they had to do was mind thier own damn business. I mean how hard is that to do ? have people forgotten how to mind thier own business ? do we all feel like we have a say in everyone elses lives ? should i be able to tell you what to name your children or what to do in your own home ? its seems more than obvious to me that there are some people that have no greater ambition than to be able to control everyone and everything they come across in life. i have to wonder about to future ramifications of a society where everyone has a say about even the most mundane things in other people's lives, people they dont know and may never meet. this is way off topic i know but i just cant understand where some people get off telling everyone else what to do ? if i want to call myself Bigpoppa then what damn difference does it make to joeplayer1. how can anything i call myself be so offensive that another person can have my name stricken down because they object. that is the most absurd thing i have ever heard of. someone please explain to me why its so important, someone please. i just cant see myself ever petitioning someone elses name, i just cant see it. i have no business at all telling them what to do, unless i REALLY want someone telling me what to do. DO WE ALL WANT SOMEONE ELSE TELLING US WHAT TO DO ? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Karn was sent a apology mail from GM krigon (?)stating that he indeed had chosen the name KARN before the NPC KARN joined EQ in RoK. They offered to change his name to some Karnlike phrase. I hope he will accept that apology and join our forces again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Embela says<BR>"What is this *need* some people have to make their names be some sort of descriptive?" <P>erm, a human need? Nearly every name in the world is a descriptive, forenames and surnames. Look on the web about the history of names. If you dont understand the need to have a descriptive name, you don't understand anyone.<P>BTW My name in game is Latin for lippy, I am a cheeky bard.<P>If I was to post my name I'm sure somebody would read something else into it, so make up what you want VI, in fact let me help you. We can pretend my name means Donkey F***er in Swahili. What do the stars mean? could be anything. Feeler? Flyer? Foster? Very subjective isn't it. Absor may be short for Abdominal Sore. Where on the abdomen? Isn't the abdomen anatomical? We can all read what we like into a name, but we will only take offence at something which is actually innocent if we are looking for something to be offended by.<P>Rant over.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=036481&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=036481&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
