</FONT><HR>I LOVE the idea.  It is REALLY a pain to accidentally screw up when handing stuff in for a long difficult quest only to loose it all.  I've been extra careful but it wouldn't take too many screwups like that to put me off the whole thing.<P>It sounds to me like multi-questing is an exploit anyway so it deserves to be nerfed.<P>So this is a two for one deal.  Not only do you get rid of the chance for making a dreadful mistake, but you get rid of an exploit!  <P>P.S.  Yes it is fun to give stuff to NPCs and watch them equip them but I can live without it if it means I'm not in danger of loosing something big someday.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;The most reasonable and eloquent solution to this problem would be to simply have the NPC give the items back if they are not enough to complete the quest. This would mean that if you give him one item, he would give it back to you and tell you that he needs more than just that item to give you what you want.&lt;&lt;<P>Captain Rottgrime in the Overthere requires 4 sarnak war braids - hand him four and he says:<BR>Good work Marine.<BR>Good work Marine.<BR>Good work Marine.<BR>Good work Marine. You get xp and faction (and a silly shield) when you turn in the 4th one. He says this same thing whether you turn in all 4 at once, or if you turn them in one at a time.<P>The NPC, at first, thinks that you did not hand in the correct number of items. If you make this change, this is what I predict: You hand Captain Rottgrime 4 braids, he only looks at one of them and his limited brain power leads him to believe that you don't have all the components, and he hands them back to you! Another quest destroyed.<P>The Ogre guy in the warrior guild in Oggok calls for four lizard tails. No matter how many you hand in, he always says "What! Me ask for 4!" He says this again and again until you reach the magic number 4, at which time you get your reward. Even if you hand in 4 at once, he will first tell you that you don't have enough. I fear that this change will destroy many, many quests and I therefore voice my opinion against it.<P>By the way, the two lore-item quest previously mentioned involves the turning in of illegible cantrips to some woman in the Academy of Arcane Science. The illegible cantrips are LORE, but you need TWO of them to do the quest.<P>Barsh Proudgut </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> Absolutely not.<P> I've been on countless dragon raids, and one thing I see quite often is that the paladin that is supposed to loot his book or the bard supposed to loot the scale is LD, so someone else has to loot it instead for multiquesting. Given the difficulty of obtaining these items, and how many other bards and paladins are in line for them, the ability to multiquest these items is invaluable.<P><BR>Sinvin Heartfang<BR>----------------<BR>Tier'dal Vicar<BR>53rd Season, E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>NO.<P>Do not nerf multiquesting like you seem to enjoy doing with every other aspect of EQ. You'll lose business.<P>Aside from that, it shouldn't be too hard to make it so both ideas work. How? Have a new button in the trade screen - call it 'Hold', maybe - that allows the NPC to hold a quest item for for someone else's quest. This way, people will not lose items by handing the wrong ones in, but they will still have the ability to multiquest with friends.<P>I would not have my epic due to the obscene rarity of a ashenbone drake hide if not for someone helping me finish this last part. <P>It's too late in your game to remove such a core aspect.

</FONT><HR>I don't get it Absor, basically you guys want to get rid of multi-questing, but since that will seem to be a nerf your willing to throw the users this bone.  Why don't you just say that you want to nerf multi-questing?  Why can't you leave multi-questing and add this.  Really, it's not that hard.  If your programmers can't figure out how to do it, all they gotta do is ask someone.  I could think of many ways to go about this, for example, A pop up box.  "You have turned in the wrong or incomplete items, would you like them back?".<P>See, it's not that hard.  If your intention is to nerf multi-questing then say so, if you want to give people the option to get back lost items, then say so.  Please don't play these games where you stick one good with one bad and declare that one can't be done without the other when quite obviously they can be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The only problem I have with multi-questing is the AC camp. You have post-50 people in there nukeing the AC out from under legit campers, just so they can go pawn off the ring via multi. No regard what so ever of the person who's probably spent three or four - or more - days camping the thing. No doubt having had this sort of B.S. happen to them more then a couple of times.<P>It's just lame.<P>The AC is what, level 31? And, in general, you have to be upper 40's, low 50's, to actually stand a chance to get it.<P>If there were no multi-questing, there would be none of this, and you would actuall have people grouping against the AC. Did you not move it out of Najena to, "help decrease camping"? Heh..<P>This is a huge example of the problem with multi-questing. However I don't know of any other 'quests' that cause this sort of problem.<P>It _does_ help folks, though. So.. I really don't know. Something needs to be done to fix this particular quest and it's not adding another camp.<P>But take out multi-questing over this one thing? Nah, change this quest, I say.<P>As for losing items in the quest, I haven't really done this. I have not spent allot of time question as I don't like to spend allot of time camping.<P>Though, I think in the end, I'm for ending multi-quest. Just keep in mind this is from a fellow who hasn't really got into their epic, so doesn't know the frusteration this would cause those folks. Not a good thing.<P>But, ending or at least drastically reducing things like the AC chaos, that's a good thing. Making people actually do their quests themselves, I like it. It's _your_ quest, right? <P>As for grouping and teaming quests, there's nothing that says you can't group and team up on the critters to get the no drop item, and let your pal loot the critter.<P>~Mysk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A very interesting idea.<P>It sounds like the AC and his ring are what are really upsetting people, more so than multiquesting in general, though there are some opponents to that too.  I for one like the idea of helping guildmates and friends complete their quests:  mid-level quest armor, high-end epic quests & SoV class armor.<P>My impression is that the AC is the only multiquest that is typically done for cash.  Perhaps, as has been suggested by others, this quest could be altered.  Or maybe a level cap set on the boots?<P>In the spirit of identifying quests that would need to be altered if this change went live:<P>The SoV locked rum box quest currently results in an item that is usable by priest and caster classes, but requires a NO DROP foraged item.  That would need to be changed, or only druids could complete the quest.<P>Greylin<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While I agree that multi-questing does lead to a few problems, especially with Ancient Clops farming and a few epic work arounds that I'm sure Verant didn't intend, making it impossible would lead to far more problems.<P>Sky quests are nearly impossible to complete at the current time, due to the absolutely insane amount of time needed to farm the quest components. If you nerf multi-questing, I guarantee you that next to no sky quests will be completed. No one has the time to commit to getting all those drops for items as lame as the ones in sky.<P>Some of the epics, notably the warrior, mage and wizard ones, require no drop components off rare spawns, many of which are rare drops. Maybe it's part of the vision than an SK spend a week's worth of nights in hate looking for an ashenbone hide, but it's not realistic to expect the SK to devote that kind of time for a small part of a long epic quest.<P>It's equally unreasonable to expect a mage to spend literally months in south karana, hoping for a shot at a pegasus hide cloak. The Earth Staff off Innoruuk, the Cazic skin off Cazic, the hand off of Maestro, the trak guts off of Trakanon and the water staff off Phin also fall in the 'unreasonable to farm' category.<P>Allowing multi-questing of these items not only makes it possible for people to complete these quests in some sort of sane amount of time, it also reduces farming. Reducing farming is one of Verant's goals, isn't it?<P>Multi-questing doesn't increase the number of items that enter the game, they just increase the rate slightly. It also allows people who can't spend hundreds of hours collecting rare, no drop quest components an opportunity to complete these quests.<P>If multi-questing is nerfed, the least you can do is remove the no drop tag from almost all quest components, especially the ones required for the epic quests. The only epic components that shouldn't have the no drop tag removed are those that are either 100% drops on timed/triggered spawns (like the note on overking bathezid and the various drops off of triggered mobs in the planes), those that are no drop for reasons that aren't related to the epic quests (soul leech, fiery avenger, robe of whistling fists) and those that are uncommon drops off of common mobs.<P>Anything that's so rare a drop it takes more than 8 hours for someone to aquire should most definitely be made droppable. I bet there's next to no rogue, mage, warrior or sk epics on the live servers that weren't multi-quested. <P>That's not because we're a bunch of exploiting jerks, it's because the epic quests, particularly those four and the wizard quest, take incredibly unreasonable time expenditures to complete. A few non-epic quests, like the robe of whistling fists and robe of the lost circle quests also suffer from this.<P>I know a positive change is intended here, but we all know that any change of this type will be seen as a nerf. If nerfing multi-questing is the objective, you're going to do it anyways, but I implore you to please either redesign quests that are multi-quested currently, or make everything that's multi-quested droppable. <P>Holden.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok....I only have a litte story that relates to my topic......<P>I am DE SK and not long ago finished my quest for Darkforge armor (what a pain). Since the pieces of decayed are no drop u have to collect all the pieces yourself. While waiting for the last piece (decayed left bracer) I grouped with 2 other SK's and they accumulated a total of 14 pieces for themselves (this happened over about a week) but still no left bracer. Then, one day i logged on and my friends were there and the told me a crusader had just been killed with 2 left bracer. UGHHHH!!!! Luckily, one of them was willing to multi-quest the bracer with me so i could finish the quest.<P>This is an example of why multi-questing in my opinion is a good thing. It allows u to finish quests that are sometimes aggrovating to do (but not out of reach). I agree with a previous poster that there should be a question at the end (is this everything) that would still allow for multiquesting. Lets face it, people are gonna twink. Take away one thing and they will find another. Personally (I admit I have been starting a twink for myself), I find twinking enjoyable because I get to quest (and camp...not farm...camp) items for him. This broadens my sens eof the game, allowing me to do different things and hit different place my SK would not normally go.<P>So in a nutshell....no, keep multi-questing, but i like the question idea and shouldn't be too hard to code in<P>Tilen<BR>lvl 39 SK<BR>Morell-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
