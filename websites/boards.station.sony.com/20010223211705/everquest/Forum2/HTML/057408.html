</FONT><HR>There are some places in the game where the monster's pathing may lead them to a blocked situation when they are feared .<P>I have heard that in some cases there were GMs issuing warnings or even threatening with banning the players fearing monsters in such case .<P>It must be clearly said that in this case they are wrong and you can explain it politely to them .<BR>Here is why .<P>The Rules of Conduct tell in §12<BR>"You will not exploit any bugs ... that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game"<BR>Further it goes "You will promptly report ..."<P>Independently from that there is an obligation for a seller of products or services (f.ex software) to guarantee the performance of said products and services within a reasonable time .<BR>Here it must be said that a bug (or dysfunction) is ALWAYS the definition of the buyer and not the seller .<BR>Concretely a seller can not pretend that that or that function of his product is a "bug" if there is no complaint from a user .<BR>Of course there is always a reservation which enables product modifications by the seller BUT (and that is a big but) the buyer cannot be held liable for using the product as it was delivered .<P>Provided , again , if there is no complaint relating to this use .<P>Seen in this light , there are serious flaws (or at least non valid provisions) in the §12 of the Rules of Conduct .<P>As an example let's take a (theoretical  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) case of a user fearing a monster whose path may lead it in a wall where it would be blocked as long as Fear holds .<BR>This user would abide by the second part of §12 and promptly report this fact because he feels that it MIGHT be a bug and he likes to improve the quality of the game he is playing .<P>As he considers that this situation doesn't lead to any unnatural benefit (the Fear duration is the same with or without wall) and more importantly he knows that he isn't hurting any other user , he plays his game further .<P>This same user comes 1 year later to the same place and as he likes it , he begins again to hunt .<BR>Sometimes the monster goes in the wall and sometimes not  - so the situation has not changed .<P>As the situation was reported 1 year ago (remember ?) there is no way to suppose that this feature was "unintended" .<P>But this time a GM appears , warns the user for "bug exploiting" and perhaps goes so far as to forbid the user to hunt in this zone .<BR>One could even imagine that he could threaten with banning .<P>Well for you all who read me , if that theoretical case happened , you can politely inform the GM that you are using a known feature and that his point of view must be incorrect .<BR>As that theoretical GM has more important things to do , he will be on his way and wish you good hunt .<P>And if , one day , VI uses its right to modify the game and modifies also this particular pathing , then it is no problem either  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You seem to have completely missed the point Darrke .<P>There is no such thing like "deciding" what is a bug and what is not .<P>A "bug" is by the common definition a flaw that prevents to use a software according to its specifications .<BR>It is observed , not "decided" .<P>If the car you purchased has not a steering wheel then it is a bug .<BR>If the car you purchased goes faster than the specification then it is not a bug even if the seller may use his right to take the car back and adapt its speed .<P>And there is no , i repeat NO argument that a feature which has been in game for more than 1 year is a bug unless there are users who complain otherwise .<P>You must not confound the right of VI to modify any feature of the game with the right of every customer to use the product such as it was delivered - of course within the appropriate frame .<P>And in my (theoretical) example the user abides with EVERY aspect of the §12 of the Rules of Conduct .<BR>There are laws against abusive termination of contracts and that would be exactly the case if the user was banned on the premises that he uses a given feature of the product whereas he abides by every rule and agreement .<P>It is not reason enough that the producer "doesn't like" what you do . <BR>He would have to SPECIFY in what way such a use is harmfull (or illegal) .<BR>After that he would have to explain why he didn't take care to eliminate such a feature within a reasonable time if he knew about it .<P>In my example that process fails already at the first stage .<P>In order to avoid misunderstandings - i strongly disapprove of exploits that harm another player .<BR>I also would see (from an ethical point of view) a problem with a player not reporting what MIGHT be a bug .<P>There is no problem whatsoever from the legal , contractual and ethical point of view in fearing a monster that might bump in a wall .<BR>And that stays true whatever a (theoretical) GM could think .<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Right from the start VI has maintained, and I for one have supported and reported when I have seen it done, that using pathing quirks or bugs is not allowed. The AI is pretty old in computer terms (4 years or so? Not sure on that) and in fact the NPC's can't find a door  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> That is why they can hit and see through walls and can *POP* in front of you when they get an object between us and them. no doubt in EQ2 this will be different. Hopefully...<P>So those places where they do get stuck are deemed exploits. If you do it once, see the problem, and adjust your tactics to avoid it, no problem. If you see it, then keep using it to get totally safe exp, you are exploiting.

</FONT><HR>It is an exploit because a Feared MOB (even snared) may run into other MOB's bringing them into the fight.  Fearing into a wall eliminates that danger as well as eliminating the need to snare.<P>Classic is the camp outside the Skyfire zone in Overthere.  If you fear from high up on the hillside the MOB will run into the walls.  If you move down a few feet they run in front of the building instead.  One is an exploit, the other isn't.<P>If there was no advantage to fearing into a wall then no one would bother setting up specifically to do it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Yea, but move farther to the north. The mobs are not feared into the wall, but they follow a fixed path that never changes. I can run in front of the mob and zap it because I know exactly where it is going to run. There is no chance of it running into any other mobs, as there are no other mob path in that area. In both cases there is 0% chance of getting a 2ed mob, so I don't see any differnce.<P>Another case is Dragon fear. Players become NPCs when feared and follow mob pathing. That pathing is fixed and doesn't change. It's a pretty standard tactic to put Clerics along the known fear path and heal the feared people as they run by. <P>Until they remove fixed pathing from the game, and give mobs real AI, this is always going to happen. It's stupid design from the start. <P>I call it learning the mechanics and using your head.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Keven 60 Shammy - Luclin<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fearing a mob so it runs away and gets caught in the geometry is an exploit.<P>Any time you can kill a mob with no risk at all or very little risk, you're probably exploiting.<P>Let me clarify.<P>Kiting is okay because there are risks: Spell resists, moving through the zone can cause other MoBs to attack you, etc.<P>Root and Nuke is okay: Roots can break. And this takes lots of mana. Less mana left for healing, escapes, etc.<P>Fear-Kiting is okay: Similar risks to ordinary kiting.<P>Stuns are okay: They have a short duration.<P>But remember, if a mob is rooted, it can still attack. If a mob is feared, it won't attack but will try to run. But you can't have both- a mob stuck in place but not fighting back- unless that mob is near death anyway.<P>Fear-kiting a mob into a place where it can't run and can't fight for 90% (or 100%) of the battle is explotation. Very low risk.<P>You see this sometimes in the Overthere. Enchanter and Warrior combo: Enchanter pulls with Tashani to the Skyfire ramp. Enchanter casts Chase the Moon (36 second fear). Mob runs smack into the ramp and stays there, running in place for 36 seconds. Enchanter meds while Warrior whacks at its back. Enchanter recasts Chase the Moon periodically. Virtually no risk. All the reward.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Makes no sense to me.<P>You fear a mob so it won't fight back, run it to a place it had no chance of getting near other mobs (the ramp or wall), and kill it with no risk.<P>You fear a mob so it won't fight back, run it to a place it had no chance of getting near other mobs (the fixed path north of the OT zone where there is no other mob pathing), and kill it with no risk.<P>To me these are the exact same thing. Either both are exploits or neither are exploits. Since the one to the north of the OT zone is not an exploit, the one at the OT zone can't be either.<P>At least that's how I see it.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Keven 60 Shammy - Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I d say a Bug is anything the programmers dont want to happen. I dont think the programmers want the MoBs to stand in one spot like dorks without defending themselves while a lv 1 character could beat em up to bloody pulp.<P>This sure is known by Verant but has not such a high priority as to fix it on the spot, same goes for the Sword of Runes "bug". It was intended to proc on summoned MoBs only but by a flaw in the code damaged everything in the hands of a pet. They fixed it because it was a BUG, even tho the players didnt like it but meaning that the bug was in the game for more then a year doesnt entitle the player population to have the RIGHT.<P>I think I got the point exactly, this topic is about cheating, plain and simple, you can try to talk your way around it if you want but when Verant says that in THEIR game its forbidden to use this "feature" then you are cheating/exploiting this. It is their decision after all, if people continue to exploit via this they will probably either punish harsher or take out Fear completely. It really depends on the players - Verant only reacts.<P>Darrke</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's a feature. If they don't want it to happen, they should fix the game. There are many pathing "features" in the game, especially in Kunark. When I find them, I use them the same way I would use any other tactic that is discovered. If they want to ban me, I'll politely notify them that they need to fix the pathing if they don't want anyone to use it. Then, I'll just play something else. There are places in dungeons where a caster can maneuver and never get into melee with his target if his/her timing is good. Is that bannable too? Pfft. If someone were duping items, that person would be banned and it would be fixed rapido. Pathing "features"? Nah. we'll just ban everyone that uses them. Can anyone name another bannable offense in the game that relies on game mechanics(that hasn't already been fixed)?

A GM summoned and rezzed me.<P>I do agree that Verant should fix the things that they don't want players to do.  It is sad that some exploits have been there from day one and pretty much everyone knows what they are.<P>But if a GM tells you not to do it, you don't have a choice.  Norrath isn't a democracy, the GMs can tell you to do whatever they want and ban you if you don't listen.  The only choice you have is pay and play be the rules they want you to, or don't pay.  Sure you can try to take up further up the line, but they have no obligation to keep you happy other then to keep your business.  It is kind of like the sign on the Resturant that says we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.  Verant can ban you for anything anytime, sure it would be bad business, but it is their right.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let us say that when they designed fear spells, it was balanced by the risk that the fleeing target would encounter other mobs that would render assistance.  Furthermore, fearing requires the group to continually follow as they beat on the mob, thus you lose any strategic advantage to your group placement.  Verant discovered a long time ago that basic, fundemental design issues (using pathing nodes instead of more advanced path finding algorithms) would cause there to be places in the game where pathing would fail.  These locations are placed on a bug list, one which perhaps has risen into the many 1000's of such pathing bugs.  Constant reprioritizing and cost versus reward analysis has pushed many of these into the "probably will never be fixed" category.  So they consider fearing an mob into a wall to be an exploit, as it removes some of the risk and hence gives you an advantage over someone else who is playing "by the rules".  It doesn't matter that YOU, the player, don't consider it a bug.  Bugs are not defined by what a user thinks, but whether the software is working as expected by the developer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There are rules of the game. It would seem that everyone here knows the rules and when the rules are being violated.(If you don't know the rules that is why there are warnings instead of instant bannings) Half the posters are trying to use semmantics(sp?) to change breaking the rules into not breaking the rules. <P>I'll just say that manipulating words will never change the reality of a situation. You know the rules play by them and realize that you can't change them on a whim buy spouting well phrased nonsense. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Is this an exploit?<P>After having leveled two characters in the "guard" room against the Goblins in Highkeep, I've managed to figure out the pathing pretty excellently.  With my third character down there, I can Heal or Nuke with (relative) impunity... since I know that if I get Aggroed on, all I have to do is change position before the Gobbo gets to where I'm standing.  Then move back if the Gobbo hasn't been taunted away yet.<P>On a lark, I tested this with a snared Gobbo.  I was able to run that Gobbo around for more than three minutes before taking any damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>a_Keven00, if they're warning on first offense, that's where the knowledge comes in.  The first time you can say "Oh, that's a bug?  didn't know."  The next time, they know you know.  That's what soulmarks are for.<P>As for using your knowledge of the pathing to stay out of a monster's way, that's a different issue.  You're not changing the way the monster behaves; you're simply responding to its behavior.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sitting here arguing the definition of "bug" and "design flaw" is irrelevant.  They could call this a "noodle" and you could call it "horseradish", it wouldn't matter.<P>The fact is this:<P>1.  Fear (unaccompanied by some other spell designed to slow/stop the MOB) is supposed to make the MOB move around.  As is fully intended, this makes it possible for the MOB to encounter other MOBs, balancing the fact that the MOB isn't hitting you with the fact that you may run into trouble with other MOBs.<P>2.  Due to programming limititations, some feared MOBs get stuck in places where they aren't moving.<P>3.  This is not what Verant intended.  It makes fear too easy.<P>4.  They do not have the resources to fix all of these places.<P>5.  They have made it clear, repeatedly, that using this technique is not permitted.  It is against the RULES of the game.<P>6.  The fact that not all of the RULES of the game are inherent in the software is irrelevant.  If I play Monopoly with my neighbor, and he keeps taking $500 bills out of the bank and slipping them into his pile, that's cheating, despite the fact that there is no device included with the game to prevent him from doing so.  Can he get away with it?  Sometimes.  Is it against the rules?  Yes.  Is he allowed to do it just because there's nothing stopping him from doing so?  No.<P>Fearing a MOB into a place where it does not move is cheating.  Verant told you so.  Stop doing it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt; You will not exploit any bug in EverQuest and you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug (bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game)<P>The problem lies in the fact that they used the word 'bug' in a bad place. That word has a very specific meaning, and they are using it in the wrong context, hence, there is confusion.<P>Here is one way to fix it.<P>You will not exploit any aspect of EverQuest and you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable things (things that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game)<P>Now it is broad enough to account for almost anything they want.<P>As it is, the rules and definitions as they are, what they are calling exploits, may not be exploits by their own rules.<P>There is no playing with words here. 'bug' has a very strict definition, and the RoC is there in black and white for all to read. It's really very clear what the rule is.<P>I'm a programmer by trade, I read a spec and code it AS IT IS WRITTEN, it is not my job to try and figure out what the spec means. The words must be clear and consice.<P>I read rules the same way. That rule as written, allows exploiting design flaws, period. Fix the rules so the players don't have to guess what it means.<P>If it's not against the rules, you shouldn't get a warning. If there is doubt, change the wording of the rule to remove it.<P>It's pretty simple really.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Keven 60 Shammy - Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057408-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057408-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057408-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057408&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057408&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
