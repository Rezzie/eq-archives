</FONT><HR>Being Fair<P>  Have read most of the posts about the Paladins and agree with most of them.  It seems to me that VI has it in their minds to keep Paladins a defensive class only.......(see all the posts on missing...low damage......underpowered weapons...)<BR>Ok VI, then lets make it fair.  Whatever is your base for creating and (BALANCING?) the hybrids....then lets do a little calculation .  Whatever percentage you have boosted Paladins in the way of defense.......then just subtract the same amount from the base offense..and give us that..I am sure Paladins would gain a lot of offense using this calculation.....I am a 40th level Paladin....who has suffered a penalty for the first 36 levels....who is missing more and more now....I dont really see all that much in the way of extra defensive abilities, but I could be wrong.  So whatever extra you gave us defensively, just take that away from the base offense and give us that.  Seems like we have been penalized in the area of offense, far greater than whatever gains we have on the defense.  So just do a little adjustment.....for all hybrids if you will, based on this formula.<BR>And as proof of the Deepwater armour being a joke now.....bought a DW Helm the other week for 1K.  This used to be one of the most sought after items for Palys, and now.....its cost is a joke.....Geez, I wonder why?  Could it be that you have nerfed it to a point where it is almost useless now? <P>BE FAIR VI.....apply the same logic for balancing the classes for all....not just your favorites......DO NOT ALLOW A PET TO BE MORE FEARED THAN A PALLY!  Thank you!<P>Bildazar Umberhill<BR>Paly of the 40th Season</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The previous post remind me about the hitting ratio problem. <P>Objective of Verant : <BR>make warrior a better tank then paladin<P>Defense :<BR>	Even if paladin get par with warrior in all defensive skills cap (and I mean all), they still have lower AC and lower HP. So this is not a problem<P>Offense:<BR>	With generally lesser str (i.e. lesser attack rating) paladin do less damage then warrior per hit wise. Added warriors have kicks, and crit hit doesn’t add a lot but u still have to count it in<BR>. Don’t you think it is pretty good already? (remember paladin don’t have great tanking discipline like warrior has)  Why we have to suffer that we cannot hit a mob? <P>My idea (II) :<BR>	<BR>	For 1hs, warrior can duel wield and paladin is using 1hs + bash, so give them same hit ratio, even warriors will agree with this.<P>	For 2hs, we need the same ratio, but u only implement the min damage thing for warrior but not hybrids, is that fair to u? so sk and pal will still hit for under 15 using a damage 26 weapon , while warrior will have a minimum damage of 26+. <P>Side orders:<BR>	This is an idea for encouraging warrior to use 2hs, the problem now is using 2 1hs can actually out damage using 1 2hs because of the procs (imagine 2 yak) and more chance of crit hits. And using 2 1hs have a much better chance to interrupt a caster. I think something can do to help :<P>i) set min damage according to weapon dmg stat <P>ii) new crit hit like idea call sharp hit (names not important and I am not good at making names) that only procs when using 2hs besides normal crit that have crit hits dmg + stun?<P>iii) Raise the dmg cap to a degree that can match the DoT for 2 1hs?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Absor (or whoever is reading this list)<P>I see 4 big issues that still need to be addressed:<P>Stunning: high lvl MOBS (55+) don't stun, the paladin's trademark is being able to stun MOBS. We have 3 stun spells and none of them work at 55+<P>1-Hander's: Paladins need more 1h'ers. Stop with all this 2h-er nonsense and give us several paladin-only 1h weapons. Why paladin only? Because a weapon that is usable by duel-wielders is either grossly overpowered when duel-weilded or grossly underpowered when used in combination with a shield. (Why give us better shields if you're going to make all the great weapons 2-handed?)<P>HEALING - If you want to increase the healing ability of a cleric-less party why not lower Sup heal from 57 to 54/55? This would keep the current status quo of Superior Heal as you are lowering this for Druids and Shaman. Also a significant lvl 60 heal does not seem out of line also...<P>thanks for listening</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think paladins should be better healers because they are part cleric anyways so there you go. So here is what is still needed.<P>1) Better heals<BR>2) better offence, kinda hard to defend when they won't even get on you in the first place.<P>Thats all I can think about right now.

</FONT><HR>I must admit I am very disappointed by the initial list. I thought it was painfully obvious how unbalanced paladins are compared to every other class yet you somehow overlooked several significant shortcomings. I will try to address these issues six posts that follow.<P>Valcare Post 1: Healing<BR>Our healing ability is linked to cleric, shamans, and druids. We are tertiary healers. We should be able to heal 1 bubble of health on a fully buffed warrior per spell cast. We can't post 50. We can pre-50, Having said that, you are right on the mark with your comments on fixing divine favor, wave of healing, and that brain-damaged spell celestial cleansing. But you also need to fix our general healing ability by moving superior healing from 57 to 54 and adding celestial healing at 59. Let's solve this problem and this issue once and for all the right way. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Valcare Post 2: Offense<BR>Please stop scanning messages and stop and figure out how melee damage works. Once you do that, compare paladin damage output to every other tank class. Draw your own conclusions on the immense gap between paladins and every other melee class and you decide whether that gap is reasonable. Then look at paladin weapons compared to every other melee class in terms of damage output and ease of obtaining.  Then fix it and stop ignoring the problem. The lack of offense and dearth of weapons is so obvious if you look at it objectively, you may pass out so you might want to do it sitting down.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Valcare Post 3: Rooting <BR>You are completely missing the point of enstill versus immobilize. Enstill is not an upgrade to root - enstill is a long term root parking solution. Paladins don't long-term park. We short-term park. Immobilize is the short-term root parking solution that is the upgrade to root. Remove enstill.

</FONT><HR>Valcare Post 4: Buffing: <BR>Moving armor of faith and guard to a lower level is a step in the right direction. But remember that the problem is post 50 and not pre-50. Move resolution and shield of words down now and you have a complete solution. If it made sense to move armor of faith and guard to a lower level, it makes sense to move resolution and shield of words to a lower level to address the problems post 50.

</FONT><HR>I see many of these posts aren't done with the vision of the Paladin in mind, they seem to be mainly from people who just want more stuff that other classes already have.  Following along the lines of a defensive tank and undead slayer I see the Paladin class as being a defender of sorts.  I think focus should be on these aspects of the class (i.e. taunting, defensive skills, undead slaying, and the protection of others).  Having alot of experience with balance issues within a roleplaying realm myself here are my views on some of the points made.  I'm sure that many paladins may not like a few of them, but they are afterall my opinions.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>ITEM: Defensive Skills.<BR>I am in strong favor of these mods.  The idea of adding the block skill useable with a shield or maybe even a good parry bonus while equipped with a shield.  Other paladins may hate me for sying this but this is also a viable addition to the warrior class, who sees little use for shields at mid to high level.<P>ITEM: Stunning.<BR>I am in strong favor of these mods as well.  Keeping casters from nuking the entire party seems to be one of our major strongpoints outside of the realm of undead-slaying.<P>ITEM: Bash.<BR>I'm in strong favor of this type of discipline though I do not see a reason why bashes should do crits. &lt;*waiting for incoming flames*&gt;<P>ITEM: Lay on Hands.<BR>Making Layhands unuseable on invalid targets is a VERY good idea and one that I have wished was already implemented on many occasions.<P>ITEM: Yaulp IV.<BR>This is a pretty valid request since it is one of the main line of spells used in our defensive tanking strategies.<P>ITEM: Increased Taunt.<BR>I'm in strong favor of upping the paladin's taunt ability as well.  It sticks with the defender-like vision of the class and will make our role more pronounced in Norrath.<P>ITEM: Shields.<BR>This is a very interesting idea.  A shield that occasionally knocks the target back several feet, one that stuns your foe and sets him spinning, one that sets itself aflame and acts as a damage shield, or even a sheild that procs a defensive field as does the Polished Granite Tomahawk.<P>ITEM: Wave of Healing.<BR>The recast time on this spell does appear to be rather ridiculous for only a 200hp mass heal.  I believe this should be reduced.  Although we would not want to overwrite a cleric's position as a combat healer, perhaps increase the casting time on this one in order to compensate so it can be a viable downtime healing spell.<P><BR>ITEM: Holy Forge.<BR>I have yet to see anyone say anything good about this discipline and I tend to follow the general consensus on this one.  It is pretty weak.<P>ITEM: Divine Glory (53).<BR>Why not switch it to be a 75hp & 25ac buff?  Seems on par.<P>ITEM: Divine Favor (55).<BR>I think the spell does what it's supposed to do.  Protect an individual quickly and with little resources required.  However, it does not actually absorb enough damage to actually act as a savior against a 55th level MOB IMHO.<P>ITEM: Lull spell line.<BR>I agree with these comments as I'm sure the other classes who use this line of spells will most likely agree.  I really only seem to use these spells reliably on MOBs that are green to me after 30th level.<P>ITEM: Store bought lances.<BR>All for this one.  Makes our trainging oh so much easier!<P>ITEM: White Armor and Shield.<BR>This seems rather biased upon one's chosen faith.  I don't really envision a Paladin of Prexus or Tunare wearing all white.  If it were actually programmable since I'm aware how your color/texture system works, this would be more related to a religion-based suit of armor more than anything.<P>ITEM: New Discipline Idea.<BR>This is an awesome idea!  Especially on raids when the clerics need their own personal guard to keep everyone one else alive.  Also, what if there was a way you could choose a player and auto-taunt ALL MOBs off of that individual and onto yourself or maybe even giving the player the benefit of all your defensive skills for a short period (parry, riposte, defense, dodge).  Dying in the defense of a cleric to keep a raid going is not that bad when the individual in question can XP rez.  Just throwing in some ideas.<P>Added Notes:<BR>Defensive Taunt spells: A low duration/quickcast spell line that decreases our ATK and increases our AC accordingly that has a high-taunt factor seems a welcome addition that woould more firmly define our class-role in Norrath.<BR>Erudite Helms: When everyone else's Velious helms are fixed, I'd very much like to see the Erudite's great helms implemented as well, even if it is an optional patch.<P>Thanks for letting me throw in my two cents worth.<P>     -Mr_Binx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Valcare Post 5: Yualp Why is it not obvious that paladins should get yualp before clerics? It is a self-only melee combat spell. Clerics don't melee. Paladins do. Adding yualp IV at 59th level is not the right answer. I would humbly suggest the right answer is move yaulp II to 15th level for paladins. Move yualp III to 39th level. Add yualp IV to the paladin spell list and place it at 51st level. Create a new spell Group Yualp IV and add it to 57th level. Fix this problem long term instead of band-aiding it by adding yualp IV to 59th level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello there. As I peruse all the posts on paladins, I came upon the innate critical hits vs undead. I rather like this idea, and was quite pleased when I saw it suggested. However after reading through the summary, I see I was mistaken. Only 55+ paladins would get this ability? Hrm. I propose giving all Paladins critical hits on undead. Why not? It would seem logical. This is their domain. The one place where paladins can possibly excell at. I will not demand, nor whine if I am ignored, but I always thought paladins should get this kind of ability. And considering the amount of undead to live creatures that I seen, it will not take away from warrior domain, nor will it unbalance things. Mind you, I have not been in the planes, so I do not know what dwells there. <P>One other thing that I always was hoping for was some sort of discipline like the Dungeons and Dragons paladin who could once a day smite an evil being. That was very nice. Perhaps the post 50 paladins could make use of this? Once an EverQuest day, he (or she) could call upon his (or her) god so that they may layeth the proverbial smack down on the evil thing before him. This would be another way to incorperate dieties into EQ. ^-^ I haven't got any ideas like at lvl x smite evil does y amounts of damage and last so long, but It does seem like the paladin would do such a thing. I suppose you could argue that that's what all those undead Direct Damage spells are for, but there is more evil in the world than the not dead. <P>My 2cp worth<P>Dnalor Paendrag<BR>33 Paladin of Tunare,<BR>Residing on the Prexus Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tried reading through them all again... got eystrain very quickly =P I appreciate your reading all of these Absor, and hope you listen to at least a bit of it =).<P>OK here's some more ideas on how to improve pallies, I already posted some that I feel need a very good looking at so here's some new ones.<P>First I'd like to begin with that at later levels for any sort of big encounter, clerics are needed. There is no denying it, if you plan to take something you absolutely positively HAVE TO HAVE a cleric, most times multiple. What are our spells? Cleric repeats of much lower levels. Basically we become emergency and downtime healers (and not really great at that either) with our spells. We contribute very insignificantly to the group with our spells.<P>Melee, it's been said before, warriors are superior to us in every melee respect. EVERY RESPECT. There is nothing we can do melee that warriors cannot. This, coupled with my above example, makes us sub-standard warriors for high level groups/raids.<P>Most groups have clerics later levels. Clerics are probably the most needed class later levels. How can you call them balanced when their role is almost crucial to every high level fight? Why do you think clerics need improvement when they are already always wanted, always needed, and always a contributive member to the group? The only other class that comes close to this is Enchanters with their crowd control and clarity/haste buffs.<P>Why do classes such as clerics always find places in situations high levels? They contribute what nobody else can come close to contributing. As of now Warriors contribute more to a group than paladins... hands down.<P>Why not give Paladins something other classes can not do? Rangers are masters with the bow (specially with Trueshot) and deal decent melee damage, Bards have group buff songs that can be kept up constantly without mana (in most cases), Warriors tank AND deal more damage than many classes, Rogues can backstab and poison, Monks dish out the most melee damage , Wizards have the best DD's in game, Necros/Shamans have great DOT's and pets, Mage pets are just as good as high level paladins in many cases! Need I go on? Each class has a specialty that they do, or at least excels in a few places.<P>What do Paladins excell at? NOTHING.<P>You say you want us to be a defensive tank, yet you don't give us the opportunity.<P>Do you think warriors complain every minute about Rogues/Monks being able to outdamage them? No, they accept the fact that those TWO classes do that better, in exchange for major shortcomings to defensive skills.<P>Why do you think then, that warriors would raise "holy hell" as you might describe it (pun intended) if ONE class could defend better than them? They shouldn't, and most likely won't. Paladins just can NOT deal out enough damage to even compete with the three above mentioned classes, and as it is, only tank better than two of them. Why should paladins not excell in tanking? Why would it be so imbalancing for ONE class to tank better than a warrior, when TWO deal more melee damage? Warriors accept the fact that they are the ideal combination of offense and defense when it comes to melee, they can (currently) tank the best AND deal out major damage. They accept the fact they are not the most damage, and in my opinion would accept the fact that they cannot absorb the most. They are the "base" melee class, you have said it yourself MANY times.<P>I'm not asking for more HP than a warrior, I'm asking for better defensive skills. They would still be VERY close to us in defensive power (should be close to us than we are currently to them) but still second best.<P>PLEASE let Paladins excell at something!<P>Now that I'm done with that rant (sorry it was long, I know, I'm kind of upset about it if you can't tell) let me throw in some suggestions to at least give Paladins something special about them if you don't make us better tanks.<P>Paladin's Auras. If you've played the Diablo 2 Paladin you know that they have "auras" which affect themselves and group members, very similar to bard songs (in fact almost exactly the same). Maybe this idea should be tweaked just a bit, and use it (earlier suggestions included group bonuses if a Paladin were the leader). I feel a great way to do this would be to implement an aura system. Paladins would get a button to hit that would activate an aura (say you get one aura every 10 levels, starting at level 10). This aura would take about 20 seconds to begin effect, and would prevent the paladin from spell casting (much as if the paladin were concentrating on praying to their God/Goddess) but still allow them to melee. Each aura would have a different effect. Say the level 10 might increase strength by 10 and attack by 5 (and get better per every few levels up to maybe 30 str and 15 attack). The level 20 aura might increase AC by 10 (also increasing per few levels to another max) and so on and so forth. A Paladin could only have one aura activated at one time, and as I said it would prevent spellcasting (with 20 seconds delay from activation to effect, and from ending to being able to cast spells). This aura would affect the Paladin and his group members, and due to the limited amount, would infringe upon bards a very small amount, considering it would not be possible to "chain" the auras due to reset/recast time. Also due to the limited number of them it would not infringe upon the variety of bard songs.<P>Now that you have probably rejected that great idea, here's another. Criticals (starting at level 20 shall we say) against Undead, Dragons, and Evil. The critical rate would be a bit less than that of a warriors, and the damage bonus would be smaller as well. This would allow Paladins to fight their natural enemies. Undead: already been suggested... criticals at 55 is insane, there are not many level 55 undead, and even if we got those it still does not compensate much. Evil: Come on! Paladins are the bane of all that is evil, they spread their light across Norrath. It only figures that the forces of light should allow them to fight evil based creatures with the fervor and strength their God/Goddess supplies. This would mainly apply to the higher level Necros and SK mobs that are present (no effect PvP). Dragons: In many games dragons are considered evil, and are almost always another of the Paladin's natural enemies. Dragons are few and far between, and even with this critical ability we would still by no means rival a warrior in damage output (at least we should not, and that could be adjusted) however it would at least allow us to deal decent damage to them. This would also make us much more viable and wanted on high level raids/runs. Hey let's go kill Trakannon, grab a few pallies for their crits, warriors for their overall damage, clerics to heal.. yadda yadda, Paladins would actually be wanted on these raids, not just a secondary character to go if you need some backup.<P>Sorry for the long post, but I felt I should explain each idea fairly in depth to counter confusion. Hopefully somebody besides Absor will read it and agree with me. If not, well I hope you consider them Absor, they could help out our class a lot and allow us to have something to contribute to a group that almost assuredly already has a Cleric, and most likely a warrior.<P>-Selanar Truthseeker<BR>High Elven Paladin of Tunare<BR>Tallon Zek<BR>Norrathian Protectors</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I completly agree with Knightof round, <BR>with the wasy the rezes are now, unles your in the farthest dungeon and not a single cleric within 5 zones and your 49 no one will want your revive, I think if we got 50% or even making a paladin only 30% at 49 it would alow the differences of the Cleric and paladin even out.<P>If we had revive at 39 that would also be wonderful. I think the only people that might be angry about having this change is a cleric who corners the market on rezes. I dont think any other class would be mad because there was more of a chance to get a rez in norrath.<P>As it is now, you have necros AND Sk's who can both summon corpses which doesnt seem to anger any necros I know.<P>So if we could Rez at 49 for 50% or even 30% and revive at 39, I think that way if you look at it from a RP perspective, then The shadowknights and Necros would be able to help people that die and paladins and Clerics could equally help people who die. Also in a RP sense Paladins would be helping ALOT more for there fellow RPers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pepto - What kind of player are you - obviously not a paladin...<P>In response to your points...<P>"1.) Your not the backup healers... druids and shaman are.. your what is called tertiary healers... giving you druid level healing is just plain silly. "<P>What mmakes you think we are even close to the same class as shamans druids ? we get the spells 5 levels later, they cost more mana, and we have half the wisdom and mana pool. Not only that - since we are actually inmelee most of the time, I am never going to have the mana to cast them.<P>This is typical for every spell, except the stun line, throughout a paladins life.<P><BR>"2.) You are defensive hybrids most of you agree.. why are some of you whining for OFFENSIVE? Do the math.. offensive + defensive specialists = warrior with spells.. ain't gunna happen. "<P>If we are defensive hybrids, why are our defensive skills, armor class on armor, hitpoints and defensive disciplines all lower of non-existent compared to a warrior ?<P>We are about 80% of the defensive cabability of the warrioir and only about 30% of the offense (no dual wield and a much lesser chance to hit). We are calling for either more offense to counter the the lack of defense or more more defense. i personally thing we should be 120% defense of warrior and 70% offensive. With the lack of dual weild, we still wont come close to ranger or warrioir damage output.<P>" 3.) mage pets can out dmg you because they are WARRIORS... hense why they don't cast a few dozen different spells... they also have less hps than you... if they were out damaging rangers or warriors it would be an issue. "<P>Mage pets are also casters, and actually have more hit points, and can dual weild. To point to the other side of your comment - "a Mage should always be more than just a caster - he should always be a caster and a summonable warrior that is more effective than a paladin" - great - ditch paladins and make them ranger pets.<P>On the couple of dozen spells you say we have, we actually have about 8 effective. I have enough room on my spell bar to have divine might permantley meme. this spell adds a whole 65dd proc to my gaunts. do you get the feeling im looking for useful spells to fill my spell bar ? DAMN RIGHT! the last spell we were given was .....*sobs uncrontollably*   resist disease  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>"4.) They can't let bash work on uber mobs. If they did it would be perma stunned by the 10 paladins on the raid... never get off a single hit and die.. that would be unbalancing.. they should give you a post 50 skill with a longer reset rate with a stun on it... that would not be too bad. "<P>Firstly - how often have you seen 10 pallys on an uber raid ? most i have ever seen is four.<P>Stun bash has a chance to hit and a chance to stun. It doesnt always do both. Not only that the stun lasts about 1 second, and takes 24 secons to reset (or something). No mob can be chain stun based in to continuing immobility. none noway nohow.<P>Tsunamix (ex paladin - retired in sheer dejection)<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is not a wish list, but simply the problem areas the Paladin faces along with my proposed fix for each problem area. Along with a fix on the 2-Handed weapon problem. I would also like to take this opportunity to say Thanks to Verrant for listening to our opinion on these matters.<P>Problems with the Paladin class:<BR>1) Paladin buffs are seldom used or needed due to the other classes we group with. We have nothing that others want to be cast on them.<BR>2) At lower levels, Paladins are good back up healers, but at higher levels this is not the case.<BR>3) We are drastically inferior to all melee classes in dealing damage, Warrior AC and Warrior Hit points, this margin gets huge at high level.<BR>4) Our spell abilities do not make up for our difference in damage dealing or lack of AC and lack of hit points.<BR>5) Paladins/SKs are the only class who uses shields, warriors never do, yet are much better at using shields.<BR>6) Other classes have many weapon options and many of those weapon options are not hard to get. This is not true for the paladin.<BR>7) Paladins miss their target in combat an excessive amount.<BR>8) Our resurrect series of spells are too low for our level when we get them.<BR>9) Two handed weapons do too little minimum damage.<P>Proposed fixes for the previously listed problems:<BR>1) Paladins need some buffs that are useful and wanted by other classes that no other class can cast and this should start at level 9, not 50.<BR>2) Paladins need a "Lesser Superior Heal" around Level 52-53, and Superior Heal around 55-56.<BR>3) AC, hit points, dodge, parry, and Riposte need to match the warriors abilities.<BR>4) Adding fix #1 and #2 with some other buffing/healing improvement would be a fair compensation for our lack of offensive skills.<BR>5) Paladins/SKs should have the highest skill cap in all shield related areas and the skill "Block" should work when a shield is equipped.<BR>6) Paladins should be able to get good (not epic) weapons just as easy as Rangers and Warriors do. We also need more of a weapon selection.<BR>7) Paladin hit/miss ratio needs to be looked at. When you only have one weapon and you miss non stop, it hurts a lot more then if you had two.<BR>8) The paladin should cast resurrect exactly as the Cleric but with a 10 level delay.<BR>9) Minimum damage ratio fix figured by the weapons damage stat (used Mithril Two-Hander for example):<P>Level 40: (damage stat x0.5) Mithril two-hander @ level 40: Minimum damage of 10 points damage.<BR>Level 50: (damage stat x1.0) Mithril two-hander @ level 50: Minimum damage of 21 points damage.<BR>Level 51: (damage stat x1.1) Mithril two-hander @ level 51: Minimum damage of 23 points damage.<BR>Level 52: (damage stat x1.2) Mithril two-hander @ level 52: Minimum damage of 25 points damage.<BR>so forth...<BR>Level 55: (damage stat x1.5) Mithril two-hander @ level 55: Minimum damage of 31 points damage.<BR>so forth...<BR>Level 60 (damage stat x2.0) Mithril two-hander @ level 60: Minimum damage of 42 points damage..<P>Also, please do NOT give us more disciplines. This does not fix our problems. Disciplines have timers on them and giving them to us to fix or balance us just isn't right.<P>Thanks Verrant,<BR>Therius Drake, 52 Paladin of Innoruuk<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, let me give you some insight on the paladin perspective - even on the most recent spell changes on test.<P>Endure and Resist Magic - ok this is a nice little freebie - but it gives little to no gameplay value to the paladin.  Why?  There are already MANY classes that can cast this, and at high lvls, when we know we need resistance to magic for something - Paladins already have it!!<BR>('Course, it is kinda nice for pvp servers)  THIS IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM WITH THE PALADIN SPELLBOOK COMING UP AGAIN - too many buffs, too little, too late, available from other classes in better versions already.  And yet, it is counted against us when doing "balancing".<BR>On a scale of one to ten, for a melee class that must group, giving them a buff that others in the group will have 98% of the time -  1/10.<P>The Celestial Cleansing spell.  Doing 440hp for 225mana total WITH a 30sec recast.  It has been thoroughly analyzed on paladin msg boards - in NO circumstance is it any more useful or better than superior healing, nevermind our other fast response emergency heal(s).  Thus this spell gets a score of 0/10.<P>Divine Glory - ok, nearly insignificant 100hp buff, but hey, didn't have it before.  HALLELJAH!  IT STACKS!  10 points for uniqueness.  Score of 2/10 for effect on actual gameplay.<P>Yaulp IV - good, great.  Make sure it stacks with Shaman HP buffs, and Self Shielding buffs.  Otherwise you will be hearing about it from lvl 60 paladins RIGHT away.  This spell is great for paladins, but I see you reduced the bonus it gives to ATK - getting a little nit-picky are we?  Was the reduction in ATK based on Actual *gameplay* testing?  Was it really so powerful?  Or did you just see an ATK value higher than a pure melee class or something, while forgetting we have no dual wield, extremely low offense and weapon skill caps, and miss a HUGE amount of the time?  Anyway I'll give it a score of 8/10.  It'd be 10/10 but making it a 60 spell - well, we sure would've liked to have used it 56-59.<P>Bottom line on what we getting that will affect ACTUAL gameplay - defense skill to 252, and yaulp 4.  Rest is fluff really.<P>Compare to SK.<BR>-  Diamondskin - WOW, man I thought paladins were supposed to be defensive too - yet here SKs have a SELF ONLY dmg absorber, while they go and get symbol of marzin from cleric in group as per usual.  Paladin? Oh he gets his Symbol of Naltron overwritten by the Cleric.<P>- Grim Aura - nice, but ya, I'd put this in 'fluff' category<P>- Drain Soul - lvl 49 necro tap - 338 dmg/338heal (676 hp total), 225 mana.  Do you realize the healing power alone is beginning to compete with Paladin heals?  While at the same time damaging the mob?  While having other useful IN COMBAT spells?  Instead of old crappy overwritten buffs like the Paladin?<P>- other taps reduce level req'd to cast.  Has a noticeable and positive effect to SKs in gameplay.<P>- mini pet haste/buff - nice again, has a real effect on gameplay.<P>So paladins getting one spell change that will really effect gameplay.  I picked on the SK changes since they are supposedly our 'evil twins'.<P>This is just how players look at things Absor -- How will each and every change TRULY effect gameplay?? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Does anyone at Verant play a high level Paladin?<P>After these class balancing acts are done I would like to see you make a Paladin and play him to at least Lvl 55.<P>I'm sure if you made it be known who you are we can get you a tag-a-long on some of the uber mob raids.  As a matter of fact I'll guarantee that I can get you invited on some uber mob raids if your willing to do this.<P>Better yet I'll let you use my character for this.<BR>Paldarien level 55 on E Marr.  Just let me know when you want to do this and I'll arrange it.  I'll talk to some friends who raid all the uber stuff and see what you can get me killed at.<P>It's to the point where I'm getting upset over the so called balancing issues and I'm ready for a break from the game.  After all it's a game and I use it to relax not get pissed off.<P>If you can't see the lame upgrades your wanting to give us the hell with it all.  To be honest the way Paladins have been treated since the beginning has been a struggle.  I agree with it to a point as our life as a holy knight shouldn't be easy but the payoff just isn't there at the end.<P>All I can say is I don't want to be out of balance with the other classes and be stronger I just want to be equal or close.  It wouldn't suprise me if our new Disc if we get one is True South Disc no matter what your doing you point South for 3 min.  Sarcasm yes but what do you expect I've endured way too many disapointments with so called upgrades over the 130 days playing my Paladin.  No thats not just over the last 4 months that's 4 months of Playing time over the last 2 years. <P>I've seen alot of friends leave the game over this issue and I guess I should have gone too but I'm stubborn and a glutton for punishment.<P>Pal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know verant would like warriors to be masters of both melee offense and defense, which kinda makes them extremely powerful.... but for the sake of makeing the game fun for other classes, couldnt you make the SK, and pallies exactly the same in defense as warriors, and maybe rangers exactly the same offense as warriors.  Warriors would still be far better tanks and yes im sure warriors would find it a problem to their monopoly but atm warriors are far too overpowered.  <P>Perfect raid groups would still include a warrior over a hybrid, however a hybrid could do a job well.  The one thing i love aboutmy paladin is Layhands, the single best heal in the game (better than CH cos its so fast).  So in that respect we are useful on raids, but upping defense and offense of hybrids to warrior levels in these ways would make raid viable with hybrids <BR>= more fun for hybrids<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok no one has mentioned disarm why do we get a skill that tops out at 70 points we cannot disarm anything I ran around for a while trying this on blue cons zilch so I decided to go and try some green cons well great at level 45 i disarmed an aviak woohoo it was 18 levels below me and took 10 minutes of it beating on me before i could disarm it just get rid of disarm it doesn't work and it's not worth fixing since npc's seem to be able to hit with there hands for 100's of points of damage even if they are not a monk give us something usfull like a higher skill in parry and riposte that would almost be enough to balance our class</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know I really want to see a little bit of an offensive improvement.. We and the SK's are the only non-dualwielding tanks, so it dosnt seem to be out of line. Its not like we'll even approach warrior damage with a bump to our weapon skills, and I'm not asking to suddenly become a combat beast. <P>All I'm asking for is to not MISS so durn much. I really feel like a chump sometimes, missing 2/3rds of my attacks on a high blue con. I dont want to do a LOT of damage, I'm just sick of bash being the only one that hits more than half the time =P<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While I understand that Verant wants to encourage team play if you are in a time zone that means often there's bugger all that you can gp with (or who want to gp with a Paladin) when your on line, then you often have to solo. (how many times have you heard "we asked for a Tank/Cleric, not a Pal" when u turn up eagerly wanting to gp after an OOC advert for a Tank/Healer at a camp and are tolerated as a charity case or told to buzz off)<P>When you are low level (under 20)and theres none who will bind you(for what you can afford or noone on line where u are)and you get killed (many times)looking for a gp try getting your body without Sow if u have to travel thru some tough zones to get to it.<P>One of the reasons I went for Pal was that a friend advised it was a better class to solo with in this time zone because gps often difficult. It would be very handy to have a self only bind spell with a once a day use like LOH that will make it easier to solo and not lose more exp than you gained getting back to your body. <P>Very cheap bind potions would work too as i could kill a couple of things for siver with my hands to pay for it, this would benefit all non bind classes. At the moment it all seems geared to the really busy times when gps are easy to get and there is someone with Sow or bind available.<P>Please dont make changes only for high level Pals, can above 12 lvl have criticals against undead at least. Due to lag on hot keys often waste LOH on monsters can u fix it so LOH only activates on the good guys :-)<P>Sorry for the rant, but if you want to penalise people for dying ok, but do it for everyone not just the non binding classes. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>  I see this is patch day. I see that we are getting the defense CAP of warriors. And I see we getting some spells moved down. I thank verant for that but quite frankly it isnt going to do anything for me when I am LFG in karnors or Seb for long hours at my lvl 51.<P>Ps Thanks for replying to us about our offense problems. O wait you did not reply to our offense problem.<P>Ps Hmm bards are getting the defense of warriors too. That means Bards are still way better group members then us. Hell they have duel wield and group haste and defense like warriors. Looks like everyone will look for a bard. <P>I know you will not read this post so why am I doing this.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well guys, this was one of the best Paladin threads Ive read for a long time, very few trolls and its good to see the high level Paladins here making the fact of our feeble offense a top prioirty-as opposed to a spiffy graphic for the theo-claymore...<P>{Didnt those people realize TG was considered a below average weapon even BEFORE RoK?} Its a dust collecter guys-yeesh<P><BR>-BUT-<P>Anyhow, once again we can see VI only cares about kowtowing and apeasing rangers. All I can suggest at this point is to  stop playing your Paladins. Play your alts-make your Pally your merchant whatever. Its the only thing VI responds to-Otherwise, its going to be more of the same form VI until while the Paladin slowly goes extinct. May as well force the issue sooner rather than later. I cant be the only Paladin whos tired of the massive power transfers going to rangers while we get more fluff 'fixes'?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello again Absor!  Well, after studying my notes once again and reading your list of ideas to present to the dev team, here are my thoughts:<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Defensive Skills.<P>DESCRIPTION: Paladins would like an increase in their defensive skills, those like Dodge, Parry and Riposte. Obviously a paladin should be a good warrior, and the design was that they would be better at defense than offense. But in making any<BR>adjustment to these skills, the paladin should not become a better tank than a warrior.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Completely agree.  Great!<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Divine Strength Stacking.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that this spell does not stack with the 50th level ranger buff Call of Earth. As these seem to be two of the defining spells for those classes at those levels, they would like them to stack.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Completely agree!  I feel this is VERY important in adding to our group worthiness.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Stunning.<P>DESCRIPTION: Paladins, like shadow knights, would like to be able to stun more things at higher levels. Perhaps allowing stuns to work on some of the more powerful monsters would not be unbalancing. This might be an interesting idea in<BR>conjunction with some other ideas on this list, and might be useful in making the sword and shield combination the signature of the knight classes.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Completely agree!  This is a HUGE problem.  Don't think Shadowknights can stun BTW; it is and should be a Paladin signature.<P>[QUOTE}ITEM: Bash.<P>DESCRIPTION: Not only raise the skill cap on this, but perhaps even base a discipline on it. Perhaps one that would allow all bashes to stun (and against any creature) for the duration. Perhaps even allowing critical hits with the shield. Again, this might help define the knight hybrids as users of the sword and shield.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Once again I agree!<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Lay on Hands.<P>DESCRIPTION: There are several requests to make this power better. Giving it the effect of Complete Heal, allowing it to heal a value equal to the paladin’s base (unbuffed) hit points, reducing the reuse time gradually for levels over 50 and even a discipline that would turn it into a group Lay on Hands. Also, it would be nice if there was no way that a paladin could use up his Lay on Hands on an invalid target.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Totally agree!  This is a BIG issue post level 50.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Yaulp IV.<P>DESCRIPTION: There have been requests to add this spell to their lineup at level 59.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Agree!  This would SOMEWHAT - SOMEWHAT help our pitiful offense with the ATK increase.  And to those who posted saying they don't use Yaulp, it is a VERY nice spell now that the swing timers don't reset after casting.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Increased Taunt.<P>DESCRIPTION: With their somewhat limited ability to deal damage, paladins might have trouble taunting. They would like an increase in their ability to taunt.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Agree.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Shields.<P>DESCRIPTION: Perhaps creating better shields for knights. Ones with better armor class. Perhaps even finding a way to make shields that can proc on a successful bash.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Agree!  But not only shields - our selection of nice 1HS weapons is far and few between, VERY tough to come by, and could be better in damage/dly.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Wave of Healing.<P>DESCRIPTION: The recast time on this spell is 1 minute. That seems pretty long for a 200 hit point group healing spell.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Agree.  And in general, this spell and the new Celestial Healing spell on test heal too little for too much mana period.  Forget the heal on test;  just give us the cleric Celestial Heal level 44 spell.  This would make us viable healers.  I feel this is VERY important.  Please Please add Celestial Healing.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Celestial Cleansing.<P>DESCRIPTION: This spell might not really be an upgrade to Superior Healing. And the 30 second recast time makes it less appealing.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Totally agree!  See my last answer.  Just give us Celestial Healing.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Flame of Light.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that this spell does not have a particle effect.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Agree, but certainly not a class balance issue;  can't say I even use this spell.  Not enough damage, slow cast time, VERY long recast time.  I'd easily give up this fix to include some of the other MUCH more important issues.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Holy Forge.<P>DESCRIPTION: Most paladins are unhappy with this discipline. They would rather see it replaced with a more defensive (or THE Defensive) discipline. It seems like it might be a fair idea to allow them to have critical hits on undead at all times<BR>(though perhaps at a lower rate) once they pass the level where they get Holy Forge now. If a replacement discipline is chosen, a shield block or bash-based discipline might be the direction to go.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Highly agree!  We NEED a defensive discipline preferably THE Defensive discipline to make us worthy of helping out on Uber, boss-type mobs.  THIS IS PROBABLY THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IMHO - A USEFUL, BIG RAID DEFENSIVE DISCIPLINE!!  Make crits and crips on undead automatic all the time, with the same frequency as the current discipline allows.  The lack of undead mobs in the high level game coupled with our already sad offense would in no way make this unbalancing; it would also be very appropriate due to our class definition.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Divine Glory (53).<P>DESCRIPTION: Some paladins feel that this spell is underpowered, especially when compared to the 51st level ranger spell Strength of Nature. Divine Glory is a 100 hit point buff. Strength of Nature buffs 75 hit points and 25 attack.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Highly agree.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Divine Favor (55).<P>DESCRIPTION: Some think that the long recast time on this spell is out of proportion to its usefulness.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Agree.  Not one of my top wishlist items however.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Piercing Skill.<P>DESCRIPTION: Since two-handed piercing is based on the piercing skill, perhaps we should raise the skill cap for the knight classes in this skill.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Agree, but again not a huge priority for me due to the lack of obtainable piercers worthy of primary use.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Lull spell line.<P>DESCRIPTION: People think this line of spells is too easily resisted and/or causes too much aggro. They claim to use it more for pulling than for anything else.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Probably the most worthless line of spells we have; but again I've lived without them so long, I would rather have other much more important things fixed.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Store bought lances.<P>DESCRIPTOIN: We should probably add these so that the knight classes can practice their piercing skill at the lower levels.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>OK.  But again not a huge priority.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: White Armor and Shield.<P>DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if paladins in game could look like the one featured on our art, with the white shield and the white surcoat.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>OK.  Not a priority, and certainly wouldn't wear it if the stats were anywhere less than planar Valorium or Kunark Deepwater regardless of HOW good it looked.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: New Discipline Idea.<P>DESCRIPTION: There is an interesting idea floating around for a discipline that would help make the paladin more useful on raids. It would allow the paladin to target a PC and, for the duration of the discipline, take half of the target’s damage in his stead. So if the target is hit for 100 points, the paladin would take 50 and the target would take 50. The restriction on this would be that the paladin had to remain within melee range of the target and that it would not stop AoE spells or environmental damage. The idea is that the paladin is throwing himself in the way to protect the target.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Interesting idea, but I'd MUCH MUCH rather have The Defensive discipline.  We need to be NEEDED on big boss mobs.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Deepwater Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION: They would like us to re-evaluate the effects on this set of armor.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Agreed.  Effects are useless except for the highly rare occassion where healing with the helmet very slowly is used, such as attempting to solo.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Trueheart Shield and Theologian Claymore.<P>These items are found on the plane of Hate, yet have a basic graphic. It would be nice to make them look fancier.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Don't care; hardly a priority, these items sit in the bank anyways due to the Kunark available weapons and shields being much better.  This should certainly be WAY down on the list.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Two-handed weapon minimum damage.<P>DESCRIPTION: How about making the minimum damage on two-handed weapons a little higher, perhaps based on the base damage of the weapon, to help bring up their popularity. After all, they should hit hard.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE]<P>Agreed.  This would certainly help our already weak offense.<P>[QUOTE]ITEM: Superior Healing fizzle.<P>DESCRIPTION: This spell fizzles a lot.<P>STATUS: None[/QUOTE}<P>It sure does, along with Divine Aura.<P><BR>NOW WHAT IS MISSING?  OFFENSE!!  We are absolutely PITIFUL at offense and damage output, and there are two main reasons:  1) Our offense caps are MUCH lower than all other meleers, and the amount of MISSES we have during battle, coupled with not being able to duel wield (which I don't think we should get) gives us a DOUBLE PENALTY.  So - RAISE our offensive caps also!!  Don't make them equal to warriors, perhaps 10 lower or so.  Even with them raised there is NO WAY we would EVER still be able to outdamage them.  We just MISS MISS MISS WAY too much - it is really really disheartening.

So if the target is hit for 100 points, the paladin would take 50 and the target would take 50. The restriction on this would be that the paladin had to remain within melee range of the target and that it would not stop AoE spells or environmental damage. The idea is that the paladin is throwing himself in the way to protect the target.<P>STATUS: None<P>Interesting idea, but I'd MUCH MUCH rather have The Defensive discipline.  We need to be NEEDED on big boss mobs.<P><BR>ITEM: Deepwater Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION: They would like us to re-evaluate the effects on this set of armor.<P>STATUS: None<P>Agreed.  Effects are useless except for the highly rare occassion where healing with the helmet very slowly is used, such as attempting to solo.<P><BR>ITEM: Trueheart Shield and Theologian Claymore.<P>These items are found on the plane of Hate, yet have a basic graphic. It would be nice to make them look fancier.<P>STATUS: None<P>Don't care; hardly a priority, these items sit in the bank anyways due to the Kunark available weapons and shields being much better.  This should certainly be WAY down on the list.<P><BR>ITEM: Two-handed weapon minimum damage.<P>DESCRIPTION: How about making the minimum damage on two-handed weapons a little higher, perhaps based on the base damage of the weapon, to help bring up their popularity. After all, they should hit hard.<P>STATUS: None<P>Agreed.  This would certainly help our already weak offense.<P><BR>ITEM: Superior Healing fizzle.<P>DESCRIPTION: This spell fizzles a lot.<P>STATUS: None<P>It sure does, along with Divine Aura.  I can't tell you how many times I've died trying to cast Divine Aura only to have it fizzle.  Please look at the fizzle rate on both of these spells.<P><BR>NOW WHAT IS MISSING?  OFFENSE!!  We are absolutely PITIFUL at offense and damage output, and there are two main reasons:  1) Our offense caps are MUCH lower than all other meleers, and the amount of MISSES we have during battle, coupled with not being able to duel wield (which I don't think we should get) gives us a DOUBLE PENALTY.  So - RAISE our offensive caps also!!  Don't make them equal to warriors, perhaps 10 lower or so.  Even with them raised there is NO WAY we would EVER still be able to outdamage them.  We just MISS MISS MISS WAY too much - it is really really disheartening.

</FONT><HR>Hi  ,,, People seem to be complaining about Pals offensive abilities .. I feel they should get a few more defensive abilities based on the Religion Faction point of game ... After all wernt  Paladins/knights devoted to God ect,,,<P> First Paladins should get a  Complete 100 /90 percent experience reserect but( only to those of there religion) not aplicable to themselves... ( the  penence thing ... heal others before yourself thing..) Read the code of chivilry if you dont understand,,, And yes it should only be for there religion ,,, after all A good Knights moto was LET THE HEATHENS DIE or convert ,,,,,, this spell should be at level 53........<P>2nd...... Palis should get a higher bind wound skill ..... Knights were trained to be healers as well as fighters,,,,,<P>3rd   Knights were trained to be WEAPONS MASTERS.... they should get as high a skill in all Weapons comparable to all  melee classes..... However You should allow worriors to chose a weapon thats skill is much higher,,, similer to the  Casters choice in the  casting area ....  A worrior could chose a 2hander for example and he would get a 10 percent speed added to his attack while using this weapon ect,,,,, But Paladins were the True Weapons masters of the era..... <BR>( rangers bow,,, speed bonus... rogues dagger speed bonus,,, and so forth) but palidins and shadow knights should both have the skill maxx equal to any off these other classes,,,<P>3rd.... Palis  should also get a spell at say level 55 called  (Will Of The Gods)or (divine Intervention)... this allows a group evac once a day  every 72 mins ect,,, One catch though ,,,, it takes you to the  temple of the Pali/ shadowknight / of who calls it ..... heheh this could be blessing or a curse heheh imagine the role playing hell a shadowknight could cause....... Also this spell will only work If the faction of said pali/shadowknight is Warmly   whith his or her God ........The spell should also have a 72 min memorize time ..... kinda like the divine aura thing,,, only longer.... This could be made into a great Quest Item for a pali/shadowknight.... Think of all the posibilities,,,,,,, <BR>        <P>Anyway just a few ideas.... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

For example Zaphodius and repop_my_gore. both of these two individuals basically told everyone else that anyone who posts a "wish" is stupid and need not post. they said "Our concerns" well i hate to tell you guys but if you read all the posts those are not "OUR" concerns and i feel that any sugestions from you should automatically be disregarded do to you putting down others ideas. Often both used capital letters to symbalize yelling and seemed very angry. If my server had paladins who were such JERKS i would have quit my pally a long time ago. Get over yourself and if you dont like someone's post you can say it in a mature fashion and if you dont like someones idea so what. like Zaphodius said this is a thread on class balance not on what ideas you do and dont like.<P>i know this had nothing to do with the class but i feel putting down other players cause you dont like their ideas is wrong and coming from the holy paladins is just sad.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like all the changes put before us. I do have a couple to add.<BR>One on equipment. The Paladin equipment is too limiting, there are no Peircing Weapons for Paladins under 30 to attain, how are we to increase our skill if no weapons?<BR>Shield of the Stalwart Seas, Effect of Ultravision.

Not only do Paladins have to get at least 7 different items for each peice of armor, we also have to increase faction, and be a smith to make it. Entirely too much work for what is given. I wear Ry'Gorr Armor instead because it gives better stats! And I can actually attain it!  <BR>I would rather be in my class armor as it looks better than the gold that the Ry'Gorr does. <BR>Seeing that the Ro armor is the hasrdest to attain, it should be better than any armor that can be attained at levels 35 to 45.<BR>Yes I know the Ro armor issue has been beaten to death, but Verent continues to ignore it.<BR>Thanks for listening to my complaints,<BR>Renain<BR>Paladin of Marr<BR>Solusek Ro server<BR>Enchanted Circle Guild</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Whew. I'm back now. I'm much calmer than before. To recap really fast, I'm a level 50 paladin who did a heck of a lot of research about paladin issues when the talk threads were announced. I am also fairly disappointed that such insanely trivial items like weapon graphics were mentioned, while our utter lack of weaponry and our terrible offensive skills were totally brushed aside.<P>Now, it's patch day. We get to see some of the early changes that these threads will produce.<BR>Frankly, the paladin changes are pathetic.<P>The only one that will make any sort of difference to me is the defense upgrade and the addition of AoF to my spell lineup. Now, with AoF, I have a cleric buff of equal power, and I can ease the strain on the cleric's mana when I'm grouping in Bugs and Bats or Karnor's Castle or wherever. (Unfortunately, this spell will eat up about a full bubble of my mana per cast, but oh well...) The defense will help at this point.<P>HOWEVER<P>None of these changes will help much in the post 50 game. The defense upgrade might be nice if some red scowling giant decides to quad hit me instead of the warrior. Maybe I'll only take 350 damage per round instead of 400. Wheee! Oh wait, that's my entire HP bar...<P>The resist magic spell is useless, since by this time, a couple casting classes already have GROUP versions of Endure Magic, Disease, and Poison.<P>So, what do we do about it?<P>As many people here have stated, the name of the end game (50-60) is raids, and especially in Kunark and Velious, raids follow this well known motto: "The best defense is a good offense." Nobody ever beat a dragon by taking massive amounts of damage and managing to land a minimum damage hit every seven or eight combat rounds. On raids, no matter where they are, the idea is to od as much damage as possible in the shortest amount of time. If this wasn't the case, every caster would be using DOTs.<P>The plain, simple fact that you seemed to have ignored in the paladin talk thread and on your talk list, Absor, is that paladins are entirely useless in a post-50 raid when either of their parent classes are present. Warriors and clerics are ALWAYS present, by the way. What makes the paladin life so incredibly fun is our versatility up until around level 50 or so. We are fairly decent replacements for either of our parent classes in the Old World. Anybody who says that paladins seriously need major changes before 50 just doesn't know how to play the class well. Either that or they've been spending time on Kunark or Velious. ("Hey waitaminute..." Yes yes I'll get to that later...) <BR>Heck, the other night in Bugs and Bats in Sol B, I was acting as both a cleric and a fighter, and with clarity and a competent group, I wasn't doing very badly at all. I was even able to keep my group fully buffed with Valor and Guard and still heal. Granted, there were a few close calls, such as the Lava Duct Crawlers and their &!%@ dots, but  some difficulty was to be expected. It was really, really fun. That's why I pay $10 a month for EQ: I want to have fun. Frankly, the post-50 game in its entirety, and to some extent the pre-50 game on the expansion continents, isn't fun. It has problems.<P>The problems stem from the fact that somebody at Verant decided that <BR>"Difficulty = Monsters with extreme HP, ATK, AC, magic resistance, and abilities which players can never hope to match (such as near-infinite mana, invincibility to stunning, attacking while casting, etc.)" <P>instead of <P>"Difficulty = Monsters with intelligent attack routines, and only moderately superior HP, ATK, AC, and interesting, unique abilities."<P><BR>Some changes before 50 are warranted with paladins. <P>The Yaulp series, especially with the change in the patch today (Yaulp 4 added at 60) for example, is just not right.<P>Currently, our Yaulp line looks like this:<BR>Yaulp   - 9<BR>Yaulp 2 - 39<BR>Yaulp 3 - 56<BR>Yaulp 4 - 60<P>Does anybody see a problem with this? The spells are not spread out properly at all. We wait 30 levels to get an upgrade to Yaulp 1. Yaulp 3 then appears at 56. Although the "days played" time might be about equal for levels 9-39 and then levels 39-56, this isn't right. Then we get Yaulp 4 at 60?? There are a grand total of TWO people on my server who this change will affect! The prospect of seeing more level 60 paladins isn't exactly bright, either, since two of the five next highest paladins (57-59) quit the game and quit the paladin class, respectively. But, that's another story. Back to my point.<P>Yaulp 2 should be moved to 22 or 30.<BR>Yaulp 3 should be moved to either 49, 50, or 51.<BR>Yaulp 4 should be added at 56, where Yaulp 3 is currently.<P>Why? Simply put, not many paladins are going to suffer (and yes, I mean suffer) through levels 50 through 60. Not to mention the fact that our offense is atrocious and we need all the help we can get....<P>Yaulp Side Note<BR>There was a REALLY great idea in the paladin threads about paladins being able to cast a Group Yaulp spell. This would actually be a useful addition to our spell lineup. Granted, it wouldn't really persuade a lot of groups to go "Hey! There's a paladin LFG! Quick quick tell him to get a port here! We NEED him for this raid!", but well, it would certainly help our role as a group support.<P>Yes, believe it or not, we're a group support character. At least, this is the conclusion which I have reached. It's not something apparently visible just by looking at hard numbers or by our spell list. Many times the other night in BnB, well-placed Holy Might would help out tremendously. It allowed the rogue to avoid aggro and land that one last backstab backstab while the LDC or Lava Beetle or whatever was stunned. It gave me time to get off the all-important last-second heal on the enchanter a few times, thereby saving the group. My stuns stopped runners dead in their tracks, preventing an almost certain mass attack and subsequent train to zone. <P>The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of the "Absorb Damage" discipline. This would be particularly nice when casters are under attack, and no amount of taunting is sufficient.<P>Ack, running out of time before my next class...Let me just go ahead and list all the changes I think paladins would benefit from, and briefly list reasons why I think you should AT LEAST DISCUSS THEM with the live team or whoever it is. If you make the changes and they don't work out, just nerf us back to our current selves... Then again, you might get paladins too used to being able to make contact with monsters more than once every three screens of text....<P>QUICK RECAP:<P>YAULP LINE:<BR>Yaulp 2 should be moved to 22 or 30.<BR>Yaulp 3 should be moved to either 49, 50, or 51.<BR>Yaulp 4 should be added at 56, where Yaulp 3 is currently.<P>Add a Group Yaulp 3 spell to the paladin's spell lineup about level 54.<P>Lifetime criticals and cripples against undead. It only makes sense.<P>In every RPG I've ever played, healing spells damaged the undead. What if Lay Hands could also act essentially as an undead-only Harm Touch? It's just a thought...<P>And for heaven's sake, give us some really strong "boss" undead to fight too..<P>BUFFING:<BR>Our resist buffs come too little, too late. Give us:<P>Group Resist Magic<BR>Group Resist Disease<BR>Group Resist Poison<P>We would save the buffing classes the time and mana expense of doing it themselves, and they wouldn't have to worry about properly timing yet another round of rebuffs. Convenience for casters might get us on the raids...<P>STUNS<BR>I really hope, Absor, that you were speaking about stun spells and not just bash stuns in the talk list. It wasn't exactly clear.<P>Allow paladins to stun interrupt the casting of monsters level 55 or above. Lower the stun resist rate of stuff level 50 and up. It's ridiculous. I've had givling black bears resist Stun and Holy Might, and they are 47 levels green to me.<P>"Hurry, hurry, stop it from gating!"<P>You begin to cast Stun.<BR>Your spell was resisted!<BR>You begin to cast Holy Might.<BR>Your spell was resisted!<P>A_monster00 gates. <P>Your party dies.<P> <BR>DISCIPLINES<BR>I like the "Absorb Damage" discipline. Assuming it's created properly, it could be useful.<P>Change Holy Forge to reflect the lifetime crit/cripple suggestion, and make Holy Forge a guaranteed Crit/Cripple with an increased chance to hit. That would make it particularly useful, especially on a Trakanon raid, heh..<P>We, along with our SK counterparts, would like SOME of the regular melee disciplines.<BR>I personally think paladins should get the Parry Discipline and the Riposte Discipline. If you want to throw Defensive on the heap as well, that would be nice. Adding two of the non-velious, standard melee disciplines to our list would give us six disciplines total, exactly half of what non-hybrid melee classes get.<P>OFFENSE<BR>I don't know HOW you totally missed this or WHY you totally ignored this, Absor. Nearly every single paladin cried out for just the ability to HIT the monsters they fought. We didn't ask to outdamage warriors, monks, or rogues. We just asked not to be so inept with a sword that we constantly miss the 8-foot-wide shins of the giant standing two feet in front of us. How do you go about this?<P>Increase paladin weapon skills to ten points under the current warrior cap, making our weapon skill essentially the same compared to warrior's weapon skill in the pre-expansion game. That way, if my understanding of skills is correct, we will be able to at least *HIT* our targets more. That's all we're asking: to HIT our targets. It really is depressing when you miss for three pages in a row. If that happened to a warrior or two just once, we both know they'd come to these boards screaming about a warrior ninja nerf.<P>WEAPONS & ARMOR<BR>We essentially have no selection of weapons out there. Our armor choices are pretty limited as well, unless you get in on major raids. We don't, and we especially won't win a really great nodrop BP if it's warrior/pal only. The warrior will always get it. There probably wouldn't even be a roll for the item. If we're supposed to be such a defensive tank, how come our best AC is still so far below that of warriors?<P>On a side note, a LOT of people here think that the Parry skill should be increased when a shield is in use. This only makes sense, since holding a big solid sheet of metal up in front of you makes it much more difficult to hit you. Somehow there must be a way to innately increase the Parry skill with shields equipped...Yes, for ALL melee classes, and YES, even above the Parry cap in place now... For the two main shield-bearing classes (paladins and SKs), this would make our survivability and viability as a tank a little bit better..<P><BR>Okay, my time is quickly running out. I *think* that these are all the items which I wanted to talk about.<P>Now, can anybody say with certainty that Absor is actually READING any of this? <P>Here's hoping he does...<P>Until later...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play both a Paladin, and a Warrior, and I like both classes equally... My paladin is my main, even though frustration has me on the brink of cancelling regardless of how useful my Warrior is. I've played a Paladin since Phase 3 beta, and have been greatly angered by "fixes" to the Paladin class. What I think is this...<P>Change the Paladin to hit table: If a Warrior has an 85% chance to hit a mob, make it so a Paladin of the same level with the same stats and weapon skill hit at 75% on that mob. A 10% to hit difference seems large enough, without "overpowering" Paladins. The change is also small enough not to make them replace warriors. While you're at it, it would be nice if minimum damage was raised. It's sickening to hit for 3 damage with a 25 dam 2 Hander. If you hit. If warriors get upset, all you would have to do is slightly increase the critical hit rate. Problem solved.<P>Give Paladins Critical hits vs. Undead: Good spots to start this from would be between levels 1 to 15. Early enough to be useful, and at 15, not too late for it to be totally useless, or go mostly unused.<P>The ability to stun 55+ Mobs: This would be very nice, even if it stunned for 0 seconds, to inturrupt casting.<P>Just that would undo a lot of damage done to Paladins, by inaction and weak "fixes" and lame "improvements". Some more things I think would be great, but not quite as important as the above follow.<P>Faster meditation: For the ammount of Mana a Paladin has, Medding takes so long you could take a nap and come back before it's full.<P>More Paladin only 1h and 2h weapons: They should be fairly strong, but might as well make them no-drop... As long as the drop rate is decent (as in not a 50 hour camp like GB). If you make them quest weapons, make them good enough that someone will want to use them at the level they can get it.<P>That pretty much covers what I have to say... Anything else I didn't cover was covered rather well by everyone else. This isn't greedy, this is repayment for a very long time of getting the shaft, patch after patch.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000666&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000666&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
