</FONT><HR>We have to look at everything available to the monk, not just his armor, when deciding whether or not a change is justified.  Yes, I'll agree that some shiverback components are of lesser quality than some other non-planar items that are available, however, even so, the monk is as solid defensively as we want them to be.  While one could argue that we should increase shiverback to a level that it's more powerful than the mundane stuff, one could also argue that we should lower the power of the mundane stuff and keep shiverback as it is.  We're currently running defensive tests of all the melee classes to ensure that they end up in the list where we feel that they should fall. <P>The indication from the last tuning meeting was that a monk in full shiverback had enough defensive power as they should.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Whoa, whoa, whoa!<P>Hold it right there...<P>A monk is balanced defensively with the lowest AC of any pure melee class, and the lowest Hit Points (dependant on Stamina) of any melee or hybrid class in the game? <P>Remember that monks were considered balanced at 50, but got no new class armor in Kunark, and approximately 40% of the defense skill increase (22 points as opposed to 52 points) that the other pure melee classes got. A well equipped monk at level 50 had about 950 AC. A well equipped monk at level 60 has 1050 AC...if they aren't wielding on of the heavy weapons that allows them to outdamage a well-equipped warrior.<P>Additionally, the monks' passive defense skills lost power relative to those of their melee brethren. <P>How is this balanced?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

That's why they decided to make monks do less relative damage to other melee classes and make them the worst tanks of all.<P>Verant just couldn't stand for those evil monks so they decided to make them the only melee class with nothing to look forward to as they  gain levels. They also thought it would be funny to redefine their class by forcing them to use weapons. I can see where Verant is coming from, Monks deserve the shaft they are getting.

</FONT><HR>  Monks have ALWAYS been the worst of the melee-only types for tanking.  I know Clerics who tank better than I do.  Now not only are we the worst of the melee only types for tanking, we are mediocre at best in offensive capability, unless we have one (or two) of the impossibly rare superspiffywonderwands.  FD isn't what it used to be either - which may be for the best game-balance wise, but regular failure of a skill designed to keep you alive detracts even more from a class which has had enough "nerfs through non-improvement"<P>  I've near to giving up on really enjoying my monk character, since to live up to what is now expected of a monk, I have to get one of these Uber staves/rods, AND train my skill in it's use up to a point where I can actually hit things.  Maybe I'll take up Cooking or Pottery, or dust off the lvl 26 wizard, 27th Necro, or 17th Druid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Monks have very good defensive skills that aren't necessarily reflected in the AC. The lower AC alone (which I'm not really sure that I believe unless the monk goes overweight) doesn't indicate any problem along those lines.  Jeff Butler is currently running defensive tests on all of the classes.  As he put it, though when the monk gets hit he's hit for more damage, he does dodge, parry, riposte, and block (which incidently is a monk-only skill) more than anyone else.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, you're missing the point... monks are not asking for shiverback to be made more powerful than the mundane stuff, or even AS powerful as it.  All we're asking is that shiverback is made decent enough that we have the realistic OPTION to wear it.<P>Really, monks are getting the AC you folks apparently don't want them to get ANYWAY - in fact, at much earlier levels than they could even walk into the planes - via these mundane items.  We're WEARING the mundane items and HAVE this defensive ability because of it.  Upping the AC on shiverback would not BOOST monk power at all, it would merely result in us actually WEARING our planes armor.  What's wrong with that?  How does that effect our defensive ability?  How does that warrent extensive testing?<P>To me it seems simple:<P>1) Higher AC on shiverback equals monks wear their planes armor instead of the currently superior, mundane options available in mid-levels.<BR>2) Higher AC on shiverback does NOT equal monks having more defensive power.<P>This isn't a matter of monks wanting defensive power.  This is only a matter of monks wanting to wear their hard-earned planes armor with pride instead of swapping it out for things available to them in their 20s and 30s.<P>I think if you folks improved shiverback even a LITTLE bit AC-wise you'd have alot of happy monks.  NOT because we're more powerful, but because we can actually wear our armor with pride.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

So monk go from nothing to advanced all in one go. Perhaps there is a missing or bugged skill there (ie. it never got added to the list of skills a GM could train a monk in?)? or maybe your tester just said something for the sake of saying it ? or maybe you just misquoted the tester ? or maybe the tester really meant "he does use his defensive skills (dodge, block and riposte) to avoid getting hit alot more then anyone else"<P>Also monks tend to get there defensive skills (except dodge) alot latter then other meleers (espically pure ones) so they won't always be doing it more then other classes all the way though life since well alot of the time everyone else has the skill and the monk doesn't (this is fair enough I guess since they are envisioned to be attackers, but aren't rogues also that way ? and still it means the original statement really is not very accurate at all).<P>Warriors<BR>Dodge, level 6<BR>Parry, level 10<BR>Riposte, level 25<P>Rogues<BR>Dodge, level 4<BR>Evade, level 6<BR>Parry, level 12<BR>Riposte, level 30<P>Paladin<BR>Dodge, level 8<BR>Parry, level 17<BR>Riposte, level 30<P>Further to the shiverback issue, ok so the AC is within vision parameters, how bout a hat/halo/hood /cap/headband every other class got a full set ? hell casters get class gear plus cryosilk.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I must agree here .. we are not asking for Shiverback to be made superior to our already-owned mundane items. I'd be perfectly happy if the Shiverback was equal to non-planar armor .. and not just junk. Then we could wear our planes armor and be proud of our achievement. This is not a lot to ask. <P>Again, note that we are not asking for anything *extra* .. young monks DO own Azure sleeves, and gator pants way before we can go to the planes.<P>thanks.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

To be honest if my monk had parry,  I personally wouldn't be to concerned about a high level Kunark armor set with lots of nifty spell effects.... Like inviso,  summon shuriken...<P>As to Monks doing all these skills more,  I'd like to challenge that.  According to my logs, my monk ( 42nd ) vs my sk ( 43rd )  show a difference of approx 0.16 benefit to the monk on riposte, and dodge.  Block and Parry ( if the two are to be compared ) clearly has block firing more often,  depending on the session sampled any where from 2.5 time to nearly 5 times as often,  this HUGE margin of error on a per session basis is not something I have been able to explain.<P>On a life time average Block is working  aprrox 2.5 to 3 times more often then parry is for my SK.  <P>If block was truely an intended skill for monks... please implement it.   I and several other monks will shut out traps... heck I'll duel the ones the don't to prove the point 8)<P>If you need precise information on the log information I'd be glad to provide it.  I just don't have it available on this machine to post it.<P>I think one of the magor gripes also is that evey other class recieved dropped armor with spell effects and very high ac.   I have yet to see a piece of monk specific armor that drops and has some spell effect, though perhaps song effect would be more appropriate,  given the whole Whistling Fist story line.  Something with a Vampiric Embrace effect would be wonderious.  Instead we got a shot at the Robe of the Whistling Fist *cheer*  the culmiation of a quest that begins in the lowest levels of the class with the sash and head band quests.

</FONT><HR>Gordon, besides the fact that you screwed up again with the monk skills, I would like to ask you a question:  if no monks (on blue servers) use shiver, except maybe for boots, just how do you see those as balanced???  I would really love to dump the 10ac/neg7 mr rings that I have on my monk, and still be above 900ac at lvl 52... but that wont happen. <P>For all you who think monks have god ac at 50 and 60 put it this way:  A lvl 60 ranger in full TV/Tolan has a bit more ac than a monk with his highest ac setup.  A monk in full shiver would probably be just under 1000 ac, while the ranger (at least Elderan when he hit 60 had 1060ac) will have above the monk's ac.  <P>For all you who think monks are waaayyy too powerful pre-rok, look at any caster in the game and tell me you still think that.  As a damage dealer, I just dont see why on earth it's possible for me to get ksed by a cleric or a shaman.  As a martial arts expert I just do NOT see how my character only blocks 6% of the time and dodges 2.21% of the time.  Riposte was around 1.8% of the time, so that was even worse. this was tested against some mobs in sebilis, at lvl 52, with close to 200 agi (189 or so - agi buff + augument).  Truth is, our defensive skills are on a par with all other tanks.  Our hp are the lowest - bar none.  A lvl 54 necro friend of mine just told me the other day he has about 1450hp self buffed - compared to my 1343 (some 1287 without equip I think).  Our shiverback hide tunic - the "pinnacle" of monk armor has the same ac as a pure caster robe.  Our shiverback hide boots have less agility on them than carmine boots.  Our gloves have less dex than cryosilk/carmine gloves.  Nevertheless, a full set of shiverback has 40 ac... Any of you rangers that whine about monk's ac who can add up the ac on a full set of Ivy/thorny vine/tolan?  Lets not go to other classes, who have one piece of armor that has the same or more ac than a full set of "Pinnacle" (I like that=) of monk armor  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>And finally, for all you (including gordon) who think shiverback is where it needs to be, ask any monk how many pieces he wears, and how many he has total.  I have more in the bank than I wear for one...<P>Fosters Kegmeister<BR>lvl 52 monk<BR>The Rathe<P>Fostee Bitz<BR>lvl 30 necro<BR>The Rathe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You really need to make a rational evaluation of how your changes to the game post-kunark has seriously effected the monk and ranger classes.  We made our decisions to spend hundreds of played hours on how our classes were performing at 50th level.  <P>Now, you throw The Vision(tm) at us, The Players (tm).  We have never been afforded the benefit of knowing what The Vision (tm) had intended for our classes.  Monks saw a class that had higher offensive skill caps, higher defensive skill caps, feign death and HIGHER ac than the other melee classes at the expense of a weight limit, no stuns, no taunts, no spells and no bonuses to resists.  We thought that was a fair exchange and spent the time to play our characters.  <P>Now, we have to face an environment where our respective power is drastically changed in several different respects.  We even have to camp weapons now in order to maintain a lessened damage advantage.  Heck, one of the monks serious advantages, the ability to live without their equipment, has been trivialized by long lasting, draggable, summonable corpses.  I've never seen anyone lose their gear.<P>I'll again present the hypocracy in your stance vs class differences post expansion and your item removal policy.  You hesitate to reavaluate the balance between classes when it is obviously changed by post-60 skills and equipment.  However, the foundation of your item policy is that players have worked for the item and should therefore feel confident in the fact that what they work for, they can keep.  Well, Monks did the work and have now found their place changed, and it is not surprising that we are frustrated.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'd have to say I'm pretty upset with Shiverback, honestly.<P>I'm a level 55 monk... I've got nearly all I could want equipment-wise. My AC sits at around 1010 self buffed- that's including the buff from my Stave of Shielding, and the Warsong from the Robe of the Whistling Fists, but not actually wearing th erobe- I wear a Fungus tunic.<P>I have Gauntlets of Fiery Might, a Tranix Crown, etc.  I'm wielding the 6 pound Runed Fighter's Staff.<P>But what do I wear on my bracers?  Symbol of Loyalty to Vox- 7 ac, 0.3 weight.  You can't beat that for a monk, really, as far as weigh to AC ratio.  And my arms?  Azure Sleeves. Again, more than double the AC of Shiverback right there.<P>I could wear a full set of Shiverback and be proud of it, yes.<P>I could also wear what I wear now, and live long enough to be proud after the fight.<P>1010 AC at level 55 is definitely nothing to balk at, I admit this freely.  However, take into account, I've got essentially THE best monk equipment possible save a very few pieces.<P>Also keep in mind that I sacrifice everything- EVERYTHING- for AC.  I carry only 1 tinker's bag and 1 Nagafen bag in my inventory.  That means subtracting my weapon and my inventory, I wear around 7.5 pounds of gear. My STA is 101. AGI, 99. Dex, 102... you get the point.  My stat bonuses are only incidental- everything I wear, I wear for the AC, pure and simple.<P>Shiverback bracers are probably the best case I can make. At level 50, I wore an Erollisi bracer over the Shiverback bracers, or my Vox bracers.  The AC on Shiverback bracers is jsut completely unacceptable considering it very well should be the BEST armor a monk gets in game for the bracer slot. <P>You wouldn't see any warrior shunning 2 Indicolite Bracers, nor any druid shunning 2 Vermiculated Bracers.  But few and far between are the monks wearing Shiverback Bracers- ask one that IS why he or she is, and I can guarantee you- it's because they needed to bleed off a little extra weight.<P>All other classes look forward to their planes armor. Monks look forward to the boots. Maybe the tunic.  I wear the pants just because I like showing off my belly tattoo.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Shiverback shouldn't have a big increase- this I agree with. But is 6 ac on our bracers too much to ask for, seeing as at level 30 I started wearing 7 ac ones?<P>Other monks may ask for a headpiece to go with Shiverback.  Honestly, I don't see the sense in arguing for that- Whatever it would be if implemented, I wouldn't wear it, I'm sure... I'd opt for a Frog Crown or my Tranixx Crown.<P>If Shiverback can't be improved, what about some new armor?  Kunark armor, like all other classes have.  I know that I, personally, would absolutely DIE for a pair of leggings, monk only, AC of 7, weight 0.1, with the effect: Summon Bandages.  Or bracers, AC 7, effect: Summon Food/Drink/Shurikens.<P>I can't complain much abotu the monk class.  I love it, and could never want to play any other class.<P>I do, however, think monks definitely lost out in Kunark compared to other classes- all we gained was weapons. And if I recall, 'monks shun weapons'.  If my fists remained valid weapons, I'd be very happy... but my fists at level 60 can't compare to the Runed Fighter's Staff I wield now, even if it wer ein the hands of a level 50 monk.<P>Honestly, I think it's apparent that nearly all monks feel slighted since Kunark. Never before did you see this many monks posting here. Monks are now the only class incapable of casting spells at high levels- Warriors and Rogues have their armor.<P>Toss us a bone Abashi? Please? As I said- it doesn't need to be a drastic improvement, but I'd like to think that the hours I spent in the Plane of Fear will net me some gain equipment-wise, on top of the fun we had doing it.<P>-----Derra Drunkenfist<BR>55th Season Master of the Ashen Order<BR>Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>*********While one could argue that we should increase shiverback to a level that it's more powerful than the mundane stuff, one could also argue that we should lower the power of the mundane stuff and keep shiverback as it is.*************<P><BR>Okay Gordon, that sentence was purposefully left so vague either because you didn't have the time to come up with a good argument for it, or because it's not true.<P>So please, give me a good argument why it should be kept the way it is.  why?  Because saying that you like our defensive capabilities while wearing shiverback isn't good enough.  give me reasons why upping the ac is unbalancing.<P>Let me give you something to compare against:<P>I did a run-down on some prekunark equipment that would keep you under 14 weight.  I came out with a 64ac set that could be acquired at mid levels.  Now shiverback armor is a 40 ac set.  The set I picked only covered the slots that you can get shiverback for.<P>Now we aren't asking for a 64 ac set.  We really aren't.  something like 55, or 60, would be fine.  We aren't asking for 12ac sleeves.  10 or 9 would be fine!  Then there would still be a reason to wear azure sleeves over shiverback (which is absurd anyway!!!!).<P>And one of my main gripes with shiverback, is that I am not proud to wear it.  Why did I ever even go to fear?  Sure, it was neat, and fun to pull for a while.  But once you've spent 200+ hours up there it gets boring, and the armor you finally obtain is supposed to be something you're proud of, or something you'll wear.  What's the point of even having shiverback in the game?  I mean, we don't get a good kunark set, we don't get quest armor, and our planes set is terrible.  I'm beginning to wonder why we even got one.<P>Why are you being so stubborn?  Jeff Butler better do some good testing...with not only shiverback but also with a higher ac set so that he can realize that monks planar gear is simply sad.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>All these people are claiming that a monk at 60 will have an AC of around 1050. If that were true I would be happy. I'm a level 60 monk and I choose to wear mostly shiverback to keep my weight down (I'm 13-14 weight with RFS and nothing else and 17-18 weight with the Tranquil). Since I have to wear shiverback to keep my weight down I lose some AC. Unbuffed my AC at 60 is around 990 (this is using the fungus tunic, a non-class specific armor piece).<P>Is this where monks are supposed to be? Also, we never get the parry skill, not sure if this is a slip of the tonque or if we are supposed to get it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Slip of the tongue?<P>It was a slip of the tongue that monks found out they were supposed to get Instill Doubt but due to a bug it was never offered from the guildmasters.<P>Parry isn't offered either.  Would make sense to give monks parry since they are supposed to fight with weapons.  If you can disarm an opponent and retain the highest skill in a weapon it just makes sense that you should be able to deflect an opponent's weapon as well.  However, this probably falls into the common sense is too unbalancing for game area again like stuns with flying kicks.<P>Anyway, something people almost never mention is the low hp's of a monk. Amount of HP's is a major factor in calculating those defensive capabilities.  I'm only 50 atm with my monk so can't say how much better/worse it gets.  No real point ot the post other than to ask...<P>When was I supposed to get parry?!?<P>hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005326-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005326-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=005326&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=005326&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
