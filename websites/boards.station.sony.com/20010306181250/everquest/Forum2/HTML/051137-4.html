</FONT><HR><BR>I have not tried any of the trade skills other than the fletching of arrows for my ranger. After reading all these posts I'm glad I didn't even attempt them. I believe this game would be so much more if you could:<P>a) Make some of the better items in the game to be sold yourself once you have attained the master craftsmen level.<P>b) Be able to level your character through a trade skill. Having players who want to be merchants in the game would be great you can actually hagle with a REAL player merchant. Killing stuff should not be your only option to level.<P>Granted the majority of players are here for the hack n slash aspect of the game but there sure sounds like there are alot of players who would play the game for the tradeskill aspect also.<P>I like the hack n slash part now but who knows later down the road I could very well be looking to retire from the killing and settle down to a nice quiet life of a merchant.<P>Just having the option would be very cool.<P>=BUMP=</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Agree, techical problems aside, the other HUGE problem with tradeskills is that they simply are not integreated into Everquests screwy 'economy'<P>When you combine this with EQ's oft noticed 'Inflow-outflow' problem.(Where items enter the game and for all intents and purposes-are never lost broken wear out or require repairs), its not hard to see why people can form a low opinion of skills overall.<P><BR>In order for trade skills to be viable, they have to be integrated into the economy. To have a more 'realistic economy' it has to be based on something other than the massive infux of coin and sale\trade of loot that is constantly undergoing devaluation.

</FONT><HR>Here's an idea. Make failures not destroy EVERYTHING, or have a CHANCE of not destroying everything.<P>Example: Tailoring. You failed to make the silk wristband because you tore the pattern pinning it to the silk. You throw out the pattern and keep the silk to try again.<P>Example: Smithing. The water is always consumed. Forged 2 handed sword takes water, sheet of metal, pommel mold, hilt mold, heavy steel blade mold. The failure is because you broke one or more of the molds. You get at least the metal sheet back, perhaps as an "unforged sheet of metal", and up to 2 of the molds. An unforged sheet needs to be reforged with a flask of water, turning it back into a sheet of metal. Making bricks, blocks, etc. of ore, you lose one or more of the components, but not all.<P>The "Folded Sheets" should be able to be upgraded by forging (ex.) 1 medium quality folded sheet, charcoal and water -&gt; High quality folded sheet. A failure gives a low-quality folded sheet, which can be upgraded to medium by the same route. A failure on the low-quality would end up with just a regular sheet, which cannot be upgraded.<P>Baking: Screw up the sandwich, you lose the bread OR the meat: Either you screwed up slicing the bread, or dropped the meat in the coals.<P>Containers should NEVER be consumed by a failure, EXCEPT if that is the only item consumed. Ex: poison: you dropped the vial while trying to open the container of the suspension.<P>Jewelcraft: You screw up the bar of metal trying to form it into shape, creating a "lump of &lt;insert metal here&gt;" (non-stacking), and you get the gem back. This is combined in a forge with a (consumable) "bar mold" to re-form the bar. Perhaps this can dispel the enchantment (at least you get the bar back to be re-enchanted). Or, you shatter the gem setting the points. In this case, you get "an enchanted silver ring" (no stats, cannot be worn), for example. Combining this with one of the gems that WOULD have made a ring results in the correct ring (success), the unfinished ring and the gem is shattered again (failure), or the lump of metal that must be re-formed into a bar (critical failure). Maybe the bar mold can be a craft item as well, using a small block of clay and any bar of metal, combined in a pottery wheel. This cannot be failed, and you get the metal bar and the bar mold back. This does not need to be fired.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The thing I hate about Tradeskills are the availiblity of recipe items.  Many trade skills have items that you can buy off merchants to increase Trade skills.  Blacksmithing, Brewing, Jewelry Craft, Baking, pottery, etc.  What about the few that do not?  Like Tailoring.  It is so difficult to get this skill up even if you have the right components for the recipies, however, obtaining the stuff is rediculous.  Either kill millions of green spiders or waste millions og rare HQ pelts.  And with the HQ pelts, you need blacksmithing.  Or with silk, you need brewing.  I mean, isn't it dumb enough that you have to go out and waste hours after hours to find Silk or high quality pelts only to find out that you need another skill to raise tailoring?  <P>Sell Silk on merchants.  Introduce new recipies that require merchant sellable components.  At least enough to get you op to 100.  Then maybe you have to go out hunting for stuff.  Just an opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What I don't understand is why verant seems to find it unacceptable for us to make money at trade skills. I mean, who sat down and determined that it was ok to kill goblins over and over for 12 straight hours, and thus make money, but it wasn't ok to spend 12 hours making a finished product for a profit. Isn't the entire concept of a trade skill a for-profit enterprise? I mean, who would be a blacksmith if they couldn't make money at it? Why be a baker, unless you have someone to buy your bread? Why produce ANYTHING if it is for a loss?<P>I know Verant thought people would sit around doing a trade over and over and over for money. And some would. But what's wrong with that? Others spend their day killing 1 static spawn over and over. Others chose to work their way through dungeons. Others chose to join uber guilds, and go on to conquer the most challenging mobs that Verant has created. To each their own. Why are some styles of play acceptable, and others not, when all are within the rules and structure of the game?<P>I have absolutely no use for trade skills in this game. They are pointless, expensive, and bugged. I shake my head when other players ask me about the trades, and tell them not to waste their time. But I would LIKE to like trades; I WANT to have a reason, I'm just waiting for Verant to give me one.<P>Shazariahl, 56 wizard of 7th hammer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a thought...<P>When Fine Steel Plate was introduced, there was a mad dash of people working on smithing.  Nobody made it or bought it for real use, it was for that "cool" effect.  Admittedly, a couple of people sold to their guild-mates at "cost", so some mid-level people actually had the armour for real use.<P>When Racial and Deity specific armours were introduced, I thought "Cool, I want in on this!"  Then I saw that this was not all it was cracked up to be...  In fact, it was down right stupidly expensive for the results!  But still, I started working on my Smithing.  I figured I wouldn't be able to do the Enchanted stuff, but I could do the Imbude stuff... right?  Wrong.  Sorry, but the Imbude stuff for your High-elf requires it to be enchanted too.  What... Dwarves, Humans and Barbarians don't have that problem?  Too bad, we don't care.  But I still stuck by it.  There were still some pieces that I knew I wanted... and the huge variety of classes that could use the armour was impressive.<P>Then came Velious and I thought, "Cool, maybe I'll be able to do some Velium smithing."  Haven't seen it.  Have't heard anyone say they've even tried it.  In fact, until this new tailoring stuff came out, I don't think that the Velium Temper even existed!  (I'm not going to go in to the fact that, unless you're friends with the Coldain, you can't do ANY of the new smithing/tailoring/jewelcraft.)<P>Then I saw the new Tailoring stuff and I said... "Why bother even trying for cultural armour?  At least with this stuff I won't have to fight Planar level creatures and pray I can get the Blue Diamonds I need."<P>The fact of the matter is that nobody does tradeskills except for personal satisfaction.<P>Even if I only received 10 points of xp every time I raised a tradeskill point by actually doing said tradeskill, it would be worth it.  I imagine that every mana-user in the game would quickly become a skilled fisherman & baker by default.  (Medding by the water, you pull out your fishing pole. [Yes, you can fish while you're medding.]  You catch a stack of fish, pull out your stack of batwings and start making fish rolls on the spit you carry around with you. [Yes, you can even do this while medding.])<P>That way, not only will you have done something useful during the down time, you might have gotten some xp for sitting at your keyboard rather than just walking away to get a soda... plus you've got some fish rolls to give out to the party to reduce the need to go into town!<P><BR>But that's besides the point.  This is what it boils down to for me:  Why make cultural armour when better stuff drops that don't cost me thousands of plat just to TRY to make... and even worse, now tailors can make even better stuff using drops that are much easier to get than the drops I need!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The original poster was correct in his angst that many of the skills had broken recipes and he was therefore fed up with the system in general and was quiting the skills. That i can accept and understand.<P>However, the majority of the posts that followed rely on a couple of simple principles:<BR>1. Tradeskills can't make me rich, thus they suck.<BR>2. Trades don't provide me with uber equipment, thus they suck.<BR>3. Trades don't provide XP, thus they suck.<P>I'm a master smith. I'm only lvl 16. I get the funding from myself and my 2 companions. We are excited that soon i will make entire sets of Banded armor for us. Our Ranger is excited that I will be able to make chain for her. No, none of this is cost-effective, nor is it uber-equipment. Who cares? The banded armor i make is better for myself and my friends because I MADE IT. We worked hard to obtain the funding to increase my skill. I made plenty of useful things along the way (toolboxes, arrow heads for Ranger fletching, tins for Rogue cooking). Now our efforts as a team will come to fruition in that i can make better armor for us. I also made my own 2-handed sword. Probably could have a better one for the money i have spent, but guess what: I MADE MY SWORD. My sword is the best because it is MINE. I didn't buy it from some punk ph4t l3wt farmers. <P>All in all i am pleased with the skills i have developed. They serve me well and make things more fun. Sure i'm still wearing cloth sleeves at lvl 16, but soon i will have banded sleeves. I will have something that i have made, that i have crafted, that i have worked for. Those sleeves will be worth a lot more for me simply because i made them myself.<P>Wow this is long. Oh well, nobody reads my babbling, bottom-o-the-page posts anyway...<BR>So i say GO TRADESKILLS!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think it's nice that you take pride in your trade skills.  However at high lvls you don't want to be wearing your banded still do you?  No eventually you'll find yourself selling it to a vendor for 3 plat.  <P>I gained master smith skill over 4 months ago and this is what I ran into.  I told my guild "hey I can make banded now tell me if anyone wants some". Guess what response I got?  None.<P>So why didn't I get a response?  Lets take a look into it.  First of all the game is so oriented towards fighting that you could just as easily say, hmm I need armor lets kill stuff in Runnyeye for some BI gear.<P>You see the problem now?  Why even pay for something that first of all is not very good, and second of all you could get something better for free.  <P>The only thing that saves blacksmithing is Fine plate.  Since there's a good chance that there's someone out there still wearing a bronze piece that wants an upgrade.  <P>Ahh back to our original problem.  If it costs you 100 to 200 plat for a piece of fine plate, why not save just a tiny bit more and buy something that give you stat pluses.<P>Sure all these trade skills were great when the game first started.  But because of (gasp try to control yourself when I mention this) NO ARMOR DECAY the servers are stuffed with stuff.<P>This is even true with Velious.  This games environment created farming.  I meet a guy that gave away an Orc fang earring to me.  Why?  Because there's too much stuff everywhere and he couldn't even sell that.  Keep in mind it was a complete stranger.  I just happened to be walking by, I asked why and that's exactly what he told me.<P>Whew I'm out of breath.  So anyway, yes I agree with a previous poster, I want to see that these messages are being looked at.  I will personally bump this thread until I do see it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know...<P>For the most part, Enchanters can sell back their successes for just slightly less than the cost of the components.  How do I know this?  I'm a Cleric with a Jewelcraft skill of 78.  When I was making Electrum-Cat's Eye bracers for skill points, I had tons of successes and sold them back to the merchants to fund more tries.<P>This works even more-so for Tailors, since they're only buying patterns until the higher skill items.<P>It's my understanding that this is NOT true for Smithing.  Can someone confirm this for me?<P>I still want to do Smithing...  I still want to see if it's possible to smith some Velium Chainmail... and maybe even enchanted Velium Chainmail (Doesn't that sound neat?)<P>But I don't belong to an Uber-guild, nor do I have an Uber-level main to dump all my cash toward this project.<P>If I can't even sell banded sleeves back to the merchants for about 80% of the cost of materials... what's the point?<P>Oh, and /bump.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Depending on your charisma will depend on how much you get back.  And if the vendor regards you warmly for example.  When you start making banded you can loose about 2 plat per piece.  Than again I was playing a High Elf with very high charisma so I would say it's worse for many others.<P>If you have a lot to spend on blacksmithing this may not seem like a lot to loose.  However  try it for two hours and watch your cash flow drop very fast.  LOL then the vendor will display it to sell for 5 times what you spent on making it. <P>It needs to be looked at.<BR>*NodinC gets ready to serve.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have several issues with trade skills.<P>----------<BR>1) There are not enough items that are valuable to the gaming community.  Too many of the items produced by crafts are inferior to those found on creatures, or have absolutely no use at all.<P>Why do things like Small Bowls exist?  Has anyone ever bought a forged weapon?  What about Reinforced leather?  Why make Studded leather if it is exactly equal to Raw-hide armor that drops?  Do you own any pieces of Electrum Jewelry?  These design oversights tend to undermine the players motivation to do crafts.<P>----------<BR>2) The cost of producing items is too extreme.  The cost of creating usable goods is prohibative, even in Jewelry.  <P>Granted, Verant didn't want every PC to have a crafted Yak at 3rd level, but why do Yaks (and Ghoulbanes and Thulian Claws, etc.) continue to drop?  Look at some of the twinks in a newbie zone these days.<P>----------<BR>3) The destruction-on-failure mechanism is very unrealistic, and serves to artificially inflate the cost of items.  Players often fail to take this into account when selling the useful items they make.<P>For example, I have kept pretty accurate records on my expenses for Jewelcraft.  With a current skill of 190, I am just over 6,000 pp in the hole.  I am a very active salesman, and do good business.  However, I doubt I will ever make up this loss.  In real life, this kind of expense without return would cause a business to fail.<P>----------<BR>4) Verant has not seen a reason to release the exact statistics affecting crafting skills.  This leads to unneeded controversy within the player base.  Verant's reason to withhold this information: to keep the mystery in the game.<P>Shouldn't the mystery in an RPG come from the story line and world events, rather than the mechanics of the trade system?<P>----------<BR>5) The time invested in the skills is not very realistic or satisfying.  The trade skills are click-fests.  It should be possible to mass produce many items, especially in baking and brewing.<P>In a game that requires as much bandwidth as EQ, the network traffic generated by crafting skills should have more value to both the gaming community and to Verant.  Otherwise, this is a waste of bandwidth/money.<P>----------<BR>6) Crafted weapons and armor are inferior to quested or dropped items at the same cost range.  I just made a Seafarer's Cutlass -- a very nice 7 damage, 23 delay 1-hand slashing weapon.<P>If I were to try to sell this to recoup my investment, I would have to ask a minimum of 25pp (not including cost of failures).  A more realistic asking price (given my known costs of a known set of failures) would be about 65pp.  For this same amount or less, I can purchase a wide variety of equivilent Magical weapons.<P>----------<BR>7) Sales outlets are too time consuming.  Since the only viable mechanism for selling to other players is via the /auction channel, this requires a large investment in the player's time to sell an item.  An alternative method for selling to other players is needed.<P>A pawn-shop type system would work well.  The players could place ONE item in an NPC's shop and set an asking price.  The player would recieve the money, if and when his item sold.  The NPC would keep 10% of the sales price.  This would allow players to sell to others without the enornomous waste of time required to sell something.<P>----------<BR>These are a few complaints about the existing trade system.  There is not likely to be a remedy within the current incarnation of EQ.  <P>Such changes would be a waste of time on Verant's part because the player economy is already so far out of balance.  The only way to fix this would be a complete item wipe of all players, re-itemizing each and every zone, rebuilding the NPC system, etc.  The player base would not stand for the item wipe.  So, craftsmen must wait for another game including EQ2 and its competitors for any hope of salvation.<P><BR>Mendel<BR>Rodcet Nife<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>sounds good to me.  Hey I'd say just about everything that can be said about the trade skills are said here.  That's why I keep bumping it.<P>Bump this post!  If you agree bump it!  If you disagree set us straight.<P>I still want to see an official response on this.  If I see it off page 1 I'll bump it.

Even then, most people can't make money from it.<P>Alchemy sucks rocks, still I think.  Sure you can sell SoW potions and make money.
