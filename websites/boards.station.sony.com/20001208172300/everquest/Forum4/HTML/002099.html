</FONT><HR>I would tend to agree with this request.  Especially the SK, if they are going to be a tank class (3/4 warrior)and want to use taunt to keep mobs off thier group members, they are loosing some of their offensive output by sticking with 1hs (as opposed to 2hs which just got upgraded).  Give them some extra dmg output through bash.  This in no way seems unbalancing.<P>Quin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No, I don't think it's a good enough argument.<BR>I think that bash is plenty good.<BR>At 45 (I'm a barb warrior) I dueled a 45 SK.  Not only did she land more bashes than I did slams, but she managed to stun me more (part of that being she was the larger race I'm sure).<BR>Point is I think that it's fine...you don't need your bash to be as good as a warriors, because you're not a warrior.  Palidans can interupt spells with their stun spells, and SKs can always sick their pet on the mob, and lifetap the mob (and don't tell me that life tap sucks, it's better than nothing).  You both alreayd have the potential to be more effective in 1 on 1 battle than a warrior...what more do you want?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What I would like to see would be for Paladins, Shadowknights, and Warriors who are using a shield be unstunnable from the front, like Ogres are.  You give up a lot of damage per second using a shield instead of a two-hander, it would be nice if there were some more tangible defensive advantage than just a higher total AC.<P>Ritsuko</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The problem with spells is they reset your weapon delay timer, i lifetap, i wait another couple seconds to melee - no matter how well i time it, while in the same time (2 of my combat rounds) i will do at least 250 damage.

</FONT><HR>Shadowknight lifetaps just aren't meant to be used as a primary form of inflicting damage.  If you try to use lifetaps as nukes, you cripple your damage output.  Rangers are the hybrids who can nuke; My 47th level Ranger can nuke for 99 damage, which is more damage than she could inflict in melee in that amount of time.  (She dual wields two very fast weapons, so the weapon delay resetting isn't really an issue.)  At 50 she'll get Call of Flames, 205dd.  If you're thinking of lifetaps as nukes, you're thinking the wrong way.<P>What, then, are lifetaps supposed to do?  They do give Shadowknights some versatility, if you use them outside of the straight-tanking setting.  A soloing SK can fear a mob and lifetap it to heal; an SK can lifetap mobs that another group is fighting to heal; if the SK is wounded and there's another tank in the group, the SK can back out and lifetap, to maintain some damage output as well as heal; etc.<P>Do lifetaps "suck"?  Yes and no.  You obviously can't inflict pure damage with the spell like a Ranger could with his or her nuke.  You obviously can't heal yourself with it as well as a Paladin could with his or her heals.  So Shadowknights are kinda stuck with this bastard child of a spell.  Sure, it would be nice if it were more powerful, but SK's can already do a good deal of magical damage by stacking their DoT's.  I think that if they also had the ability to go "full burn" with their lifetaps and come out ahead of the game, they'd probably be overly powerful.  &lt;cough&gt;Necros&lt;cough&gt;<P>This thread's gone way off the topic of shields, but I thought I'd post my thoughts on the lifetap issue anyway.  =]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok lehros, so i say lifetaps suck. Well you know what? When i started my SK we did NOT have lifetaps. They were a half-assed addition to the spell line later in my career. <P>Currently the lifetap at L30 is what we live with until we do the VERY HARD quest for the 280 tap (2 min recast) at 50 or wait until we get the 65 tap at 51. <P>Pushing the 65 tap to 39 and having a different one at 49 would do much towards increasing how much they are used. Lowering the recast time of the extremely mana-sucking Life Leech would also help. Currently life leech is not even 1dmg/1mana.<P>All i have done is countered your arguements from MY perspective as a 47 SK. Sure.. i can stack DoTs (about 440 dmg at most) but it takes me about 20 seconds to do that and generally i never keep all my DoTs mem'd (currently only darkness and heart flutter, the rest are spells i would rather use- FD, Vampiric embrace, cancel magic etc)<P>At 49 i get one new DoT. Dooming Darkness. (300 dmg/ 1 1/2 minutes, 60% slowdown)<P>&gt;&gt;A soloing SK can fear a mob and lifetap it to heal; an SK can lifetap mobs that another group is fighting to heal<P>Will not work until 49 with Invoke Fear. The new early running in critters does help but my being a troll i regen faster and would just prefer to heal while medding. the "Fear" spell lasts 18 seconds with a cast time of 4 seconds. This means for optimal efficiency/damage avoidance i must recast it after 14 seconds have passed, and this is barring resists which are very liable to happen.<P>&gt;&gt;I think that if they also had the ability to go "full burn" with their lifetaps and come out ahead of the game, they'd probably be overly powerful. &lt;cough&gt;Necros&lt;cough&gt;<P>All life taps have inordinately long cast times. Life Leech has one mark in its favor - at 2.5 seconds it is the fastest casting highest damage lifetap in the SK lines all the way to 60.<P>- Dran</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's worth pointing out that SK's get a lot of versatility back for the combat edge that they give up, as opposed to a Warrior.  Sure, you can't do as much melee damage as a Warrior can.  But a Warrior cannot lifetap for any amount of hitpoints, or invis, invis to undead, Feign Death, Harm Touch, Shadowstep, transfer hitpoints to another person, Hide, See Invis, nuke vs undead, put a lifetap on any weapon via Vampiric Embrace, use a pet (which may not be that great, but it doesn't hurt when used correctly)...  These are all things that an SK can do.  SK's aren't particularly good at many of those things, but they're much better at those things than Warriors are.  A Warrior's life is pure combat, and nothing else, so they deserve to be the best.  This does invite the question: What's the point of giving up up being the best at combat to get some more options, when all of my options suck?  Well, in my personal opinion, SK's options don't suck.<P>Back on topic though, most Shadowknights and Paladins use their Bash skill thousands of times more over their careers than a Warrrior does.  Perhaps they deserve to be just as good at that as Warriors can be.  Like I said earlier though, I think shields should be enhanced more defensively than offensively.  They're not weapons, after all.  They're shields.  If they gave me a decent, appreciable increase to my defensive skills, as well as giving me a half-decent chance of interrupting spell castings, I would call it good.<P>By the way, I have a level 24 SK in addition to my afore-mentioned Ranger.  I can't claim to have as intimate a knowledge of the class as Dran does, but I'm not completely in the dark, either.  And my Shadowknight is Human.  You may all now inform me of how much Human SK's suck.<P>Ritsuko</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>FYI for those who don't know the is Aerocorn...<P>Ok, heres my Deal I agree with Kel, but I have more to say...<P>I do not think the whole expansion idea was throughly thought through. Warriors now have the ability to cast procs, No offense to any warriors but what the hell is this? Warriors have like 0 int how do they get the ability to WILL (INT/DEX) an item to cast. In the DnD sense this makes NO SENSE. I believe they should be able to BUT with a large faliure rate or a rate based off their intellengence I view this as an unfair advantage. Kinda took away the reason why I am a shadow knight and gave up the ability to be a more effective meleer. Either decrease success rate or give SK's Paladins Disciplines.<P>Second off the cast time on the new spells are retarded... How the hell are you supposed to cast a 6 sec spell in battle and land it? as soon as you cast 1 you are uber agroed and the pet just cackles all day. "hehehe hehehe - SHUT UP Kasn! Do your damn job and Taunt!" I think increasing pet taunts is in order. Ohh btw SK pets taunt when taunt was turned off.... HMMMMMM?! Bug?<P>Third Off, Blood Embre - OK, Fear, Darkness, Feigndeath I can understand but what the hell is Greater shielding? What the hell is this?! Umm, very disappointed, give us a Life Tap or something not Great Shielding I don't even know what class cast this?! hmph! Goes back to the mend bones for pets concept... DUH!? Yell at this game designer he's not thinking straight!<P>Fouth off, Dodge, reposite yada yada - Umm, Hey SK's and Paladins did you know reposite is an extra attack?! OMG! this whole time I thought it was a dodge! HMMM? cheated yet again. I have NEVER seen a dmg hit from reposite not once!<P>Ok, if warriors get to keep their casts, which Sk's Paly's live by - I think we should get higher Dodge, and reposite to balance the classes. This will help in the long cast time and since we are part caster it makes more sense. We have lower hp's lower melee lower dodge lower reposite then a warrior - me 54 sk has 1800hps 54 warrior has WELL over 2k - me 54 sk has like 175 dodge cant cast spit - Warrior has like 220?!?!? ummm makes no sense. Warriors are dumb meat shields, their job is to get beat on - sk's pally's are slightly more intellegent dumb meat shields - I think If I were a real life sk I would invest my training in AVOIDING being hit so I can cast my damage spells since thats what we are specialized for; I think paladins would invest the same amount in effort training so they can heal and do silly paly stuff..<P>OHH BTW I was ks'ed by a 40 MAGE!!!!! GRRR WT?! <P>***AHEM***<BR>My new play nice policy. <BR>I will no longer call GM's they are usless anyway.<BR>I will no longer report people. <BR>I will no longer help people in need I don't know. <BR>I will no longer let people KS from me. <BR>I will no longer sit and listen to a GM tell me how to play my character. <BR>I will no longer socialize with morons. <BR>I will no longer be thoughtful of people around me ( I am evil you don't like it? then...

</FONT><HR>Ok I have read a few post on this board to come to conclude that warriors are greedy mofos, they want more but don't want to let any other class have more, they way warriors see it, if warriors are better then the group is better, but if a hybrids wants to even out a little then they are called greedy, only wanting to be the best, and all that other good stuff. Now you warriors have armor that can cast spells, oh yes I know its hard to get and **** like this, but I have seen so many stupid post about what paladins get and thats why that don't need any more, so now GUESS what you ***** warriors I am going to turn that **** right back in your face.  Ok so now warrior can cast spells get disciplines and have more hp ac and all that other good warrior stuff, without the HYBRID exp penlity,  SO now I ask you is this fair, and if you claim it to be fair please explain why. OH yes before I forget you warriors know that Rangers have the same level of archery as you do, yep its true you about get 240 in the skill, so why are you not cring over that as well, and if thats not such a big deal why would giving sk/pal the same cap in bash as warrior be any different, lets look at the fact sk/pal are pretty much sword + shield people, so if they trian in that fight style more then they should get higher caps.  One other thing on that subject when you say the word Knight whats the first image that pops in your head, probably a guy in a full suit of plate armor with a sword and shield, and knights are the sk/pal not the warrior.  Warriors are more like the grunts on the front line of a battle field.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I mean, maybe reckless str, but the cast time is probably at least 3 times as long as a real cast of it.  Yes, we get discs, as do all other pure melees, and we get more ac and hps as do all other melees and hybrids.  Nope, no hybrid penalty.  Why?  No spells, no root, nothing offensive.  Sure our spells are nice utility, and even nice buffs when no one is grouped with us.  But I'm fairly certain that any equivlant hybrid buffs would out do our armor buffs, so you're still better off.  If anything needs to be changed here for hybrids, it's the spells on their armor. <BR>-----------------------------------------------<BR>My final point is this.  You chose to be a hybrid.  Part of that is that you can't melee as well as a warrior, you're not 100% warrior.  If you want to be, PLAY ONE.

Nope, I have to hack 'n slash my way through every last HP it's got. (Probable reason for higher skill base? Hmmmmm) <P>The simple fact is an SK's diciplines are spread out through magic and melee. As an SK you couldn't focus exclusively on melee skills. As a warrior, I can. I have only my blades and my life. I focus on my skills with weapons and ability to take massive amounts of damage to keep my group alive. <P>As far as weapons that proc I have only one question. Would we make it so that only those clases that use mana/spells be able to use weapons that proc? (That sounds fair!)<P>PaulyX, please stop complaining. There is a difference with classes and SK's get things that Warriors don't. Likewise, warrirors get things that SK's don't. If your unsatisfied with your class, start over. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok its true we hybrids are not pure warriors, and not pure casters, but we are 3/4 warriors and 1/4 casters. If you add up all our spells and add up all our parent class spells you will see we have about 1/4 of their total spells. Now lets look at the other side of the coin, we are suppose to be 3/4 warriors but if you add up all the warrior skills, yes including disciplines as they are new skills, no other way to catiogorise them, so now if you add them all up and take a look at the hybrids and add up all their skills and compaire them to the warriors total you will see we hybrids are no where near our 3/4 warrior standings that we should be, I think it comes some where near the 1/2 warrior. So now that you see that we hybrids are down 1/4 of what we should be, is it really asking too much to have an increase in our fighting skills we already have since we are not the 3/4 warriors we should be. Please tell me where we hybrids make up this 1/4 warrior status that I see we are missing, I really want to know, maybe you warriors have an insite to this that I perhaps missed, but if you can't find this missing 1/4 then perhaps you would be more open or have some suggestions on how to close this missing part  of our 3/4 warrior status.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/002099-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/002099-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=002099&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=002099&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
