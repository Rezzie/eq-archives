</FONT><HR>Power levelling is becoming a very common occurence in Norrath. Unrest is full of wolf pairs, one lvl 60 the other lvl 10 or so. The lvl 60 pulls monsters only a good group of mid 20s can kill but ha ! low and behold the lvl 10 is soloing them, because his friend has buffed him to the brink with shields and god knows what to make it a breeze for him to kill those things.<BR>People are levelling from 1 to 40 in a week using these methods. It reminds me of the saga of UOextreme when UO was becoming full of exploits and people lost all interest in it.<P>This is not an exploit as such but it is certainly destroying game balance and is just unfair for others that work hard at gaining their levels to see these things happen around them. The other thing thatis unfair is that in unrest for exple it is now hard to find some beasts to pull because these level 60 have pulled them all.. and if their little lvl 0 friend cannot solo the train the brought to him they just destroy it themselves.<P>Verant - you need to do something about this. It has to stop. No character should be allowed to level 40 levels in a week.<P>If you allow that then you should allow keyboard key jamming like in UP where you would keep a key down (with a match for exple) to make it possible for us to loop the same action over and over again to gain skill levels for exple. That way my monk will max all his skill in a matter of hours - I really don't see a difference between this and powerlevelling.<P>So either stop this power levelling nonsense or give me maxed skills in mend - feign - 1 h blunt ect as soon as I level - oh by the way if you did that then you'd destroy your game.<P>These powerlevellers are turning this game into a qyake shoot them up type game --- stop it and bring back the RPG essence back in.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This isn't a race to see who can get to 60 first... the only real reason to argue against power-leveling is jealousy that you AREN'T being PL'ed and you're tired of playing a game that has very little content for people between levels 15 and 20.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>The entire design of EQ, mired in downtime and the slow slow crawl of advancement, fosters powergaming.<P>So you could say that the game is purposefully designed to actually cause players to want to powergame. YOu'd be right if you said that. I think that, naively, Verant did not intend for their design to do that but it directly does.<P>There are problems with limiting someone's advancement also. How much do you limit? If you put in artificial barriers like "You have gained 20 levels this week, you can level no more" it then sets up Stops To Normal Advancement in the game which make it seem more like a game than a fantasy roleplaying game.<P>The problem is that the game was designed this way in the first place. If players had more enjoyable advancement and more ways to advance than grouping and dying all the time (games like UO 2 and anarchy online are looking into this, advancement through trade skills and such and Xp for other activities) They would not want to "powerlevel" or get "powerleveled."<P>Anarchy online is going to even have things like autogenerating quest booths where the player, and a friend likely of the same power, can get transported to a cave which is made just for their level of prowess on the fly and complete a quest for xp or advancement. It will also have advancement through trades though I remember reading that if a level 20 monk and a level 40 tradesperson get in a fight the 20 monk would own them severely ; )  <P>The problem in EQ is the miring in downtime and the difficulties associated with travelling and dying for so much xp loss and begging for groups or the assitence of other players. You must do this or contend with these things for your entire Everquest character's existence. So, of course, when the opportunity presents itself to take a shortcut by powerleveling up a firend a bit it is of course done.<P>Other reasons for powerleveling are the dealing with other design problems in this game. For example, X guild wants to do big things but the lack of clerics and enchanters who have been wooed away to X super duper power guild who controls All (Gods of the Most High or some other goofy name (note: fictious guild sorry if stepped on any toes) ), makes X guild unable to. So of course some of the classes they have more than enough of get with some of the druids and they make some enchanters and clerics and power level them up to play as characters when needed for some of this uber stuff THEY JUST PLAIN CAN'T DO OTHERWISE.<P>So there are many reasons for powerleveling, but some of them are DIRECTLY CAUSED by the design of the game and NEEDING x class which is never around. You can be a guild of the most nice, friendly, fun to play with, helpful, giving, well intentioned people in the world but if you are not doing the uberest things that enchanter and cleric will be wooed over to X guild which raids pog and trakkanon once a week and gets everyone epic cleric weapons. <P>You are not that uber, you can't, so its time someone PL'd some clerics and chanters! A clear case of shortsighted design directly causing bad behavior. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To all those who think that I'm jealous or what have you ... you are totally wrong.<P>I have a high level 50 magician, she was already level 50 back in September 1999 but I quit the game due to personal work reasons. And trust me .. noone powerlevelled me as I was the highest character bar 1 in my server (prexus). <P>I returned lately and started a monk because I really enjoy starting new characters. I have a lot of high level friends including my own brother's high level druid and cleric. So really if I wanted to power level I would actually do it myself, since I can login the two accounts and play them both (if I wanted) as the computers are next to each other.<P>BUT , I refuse this silly approach of powerlevelling. And to those of you who think that it does not affect me.. well you are wrong.<P>Try going to unrest to pull the bartender and see if you will like it if you find 2 wolves in the bartender room , 1 level 60 and 1 level 10 hogging not only that room but the room above it and the magi room and most of the connecting rooms.  <P>I can give you so many other exemples too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I used to be against power leveling.<P>However, I think it is a necessary evil in a level-based game. When you introduce a friend to this game, typically you're not going to want to start over with your friend. Instead you're going to help him try to get closer to your level so you two can advance together. Your level of help may be just twinking, or direct power-leveling, but in either case, you're effectively "power leveling" him.<P>Another example... say you have a regular group of 4 or so, and one of the group wants to try a new character. Sure you could abandon her and become a regular group of 3, or you could help her get her new character up to a level where you can all continue to advance.<P>It's really not as bad as it seems. It only feels bad when they are killing things you seem to think you have more of a right to kill.<P>- dpk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Many players who power level have a tight network of friends at the upper-end of the level scale that they have knowen for YEARS, since the starting of EQ final, to the early days of beta, and even from older games. They may of gotten bored of their primary character, but not of their friends. So they wish to quickly get back to the level where they cna group with their old friends again, and not have to worry about the hassles of finding a group or getting new items.<P>If it was not for the ability to power-level, Verant would probably lose alot of customers, who no longer enjoy playing their primary character, and do not want to go though the hassle of leveling a new one.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This isn't a race to see who can get to 60 first... the only real reason to argue against power-leveling is jealousy that you AREN'T being PL'ed and you're tired of playing a game that has very little content for people between levels 15 and 20.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>The old "jealousy" crap that comes up time after time, invariably from the anti-ethical bunch. I'll say it again. It is a moot point as to who is jealous of whom here. You could say (and that is certainly always my response) that the person being pl'ed is jealous of what others have accomplished without pl'ing and that is why they do it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh boy, another one of these threads.<P>Your problem is not the fact that people can power level, it is that they are doing it in such a way that inconveniences you (and other people). <P>Did you ask these people when they would be done?  Did you consider hunting somewhere else?<P>Chances are they wouldn't be there that long... I've been on the receiving end of powerleveling, I had a couple characters go from level 12 to level 15 in about an hour.  It's nothing major compared to what you seem to be thinking these guys are doing, but it gave me a boost.  I do know that there are more efficent places to power level from 1 to 40 (or at least to about level 30, which is when a single druid becomes mostlyly ineffective at powerleveling).  Unrest is good for going to level 15 really quick, you pull the yard for about an hour, then you are done and you go somewhere else.  There is no way that a druid can keep a level 10 alive pulling the house.  <P>That said, you have to realize that the power levelers are not newbies (at least not 99% of them).  They are people who have played the game long enough to develop friendships with the druids who do this for them (I've heard the druid's take on this too, it is apparently the most colossally boring thing to do in game).  They zip through the low levels, then spend some time (if they have any brains at all) practicing skills, then they go play as normal for what they consider the interesting parts of the game.  <P>What it boils down to is that you want to ruin what someone else considers fun because they are impacting your fun.  Ask them to share, or petition for PnP.  <P>There is nothing wrong with power leveling, nor is it cheating... the same way that there is nothing wrong with twinking (which is also not cheating).  Some do it, some don't, and most people seem to be rabid about it one way or the other. <P>Garg: who the heck takes 6-8 weeks to get to 40 as 'normal'?  I hope you mean play time and not real time.  I've been playing since june 99 and my highest is 40, I've got about a dozen others in the 20's over a couple servers, and a smattering of lower level characters.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Groov,<BR>I can understand that people powerleveling and taking from the creatures you want to hunt would cause you probelms.  However, you are missing the point, powerleveling per se is not the problem, it is just the inconsiderate people that are the problem.  These people are the same ones that would be pulling your mobs and killstealing in the first place.  There are plenty of people powerleveling who do take into consideration those around them.  If I head to Unrest and there are groups there, I go elsewhere if it looks like I'll be causing them problems.  <P>So, next time you are in Unrest, you shouldn't be thinking "@*%# those powerlevelers"; you should be thinking "#$^@ those jerks".  <P><BR>As for whether or not powerleveling is legitimate.  If you don't think it is, fine, don't do it, but realize you have no right to force everyone else to play the game the way you think it should be played.  These seems to be a constant problem in online games.  Verant would be unwise to get rid of powerleveling abilities.  The ability to powerlevel adds to the longevity of the game for most people.  I played my first character legitimately to level 44 over two years, definitely not powerleveling at that rate.  Well, now I feel like playing other characters, but I don't feel like leveling through the first 20 levels of the game the old way, been there, done that.  The problem is the first 20 levels of the game don't offer a whole lot of variety, you can only kill so many bears and mundane animals before it gets tiring, and there are few low level places to explore.  As I feel may be the case for others, if I had to play a second character just as slow as my first, I would be done with the game when I lost interest in my first character.  <P>Now, I wouldn't recommend powerleveling to a first time player, it robs them of the fun that you have the first time through everything, and keeps them from acquiring the personal skill level that you learn by slowly developing your character over time.  But, when someone has been through those things over and over again with different characters, there really is no point in sitting through it.  And if they had to, most wouldn't play the game again.<P>Verant makes a lot of money off these people and they know it.  They make up a good portion of people that own more than one account, (which makes powerleveling possible).  With sales figures still so strong and relatively few true newbies appearing in the game, I think it may be a safe assumption that alot of their current sales are people buying a second account or even more.<P>Now Groov, when you get your character to a high level, and like most of us, feel that you "earned" your levels fair and square, see if you feel like repeating the entire process again with a second character and no powerleveling at all.  (Personally I like to get my characters PL'd to about 25, at which point I think the game starts to open up a bit variety and more interesting content).   If you do chose to do so (you may have already done so), well...personally, I think you are a glutton for punishment, but if it makes you happy...you are entitled to play the game the way you want to play it, as I am entitled to my way.<P>Sorry for the rambling. =)<P>Aluinae Emberwood<BR>44th Druid of Test Server </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It does affect lower level natural players.<P>These power levelers often take spawns, chew them up, and spit them out so fast that single characters can often take on the entire zone. Joe-schmo here wants to kill some death beetles in Unrest, but this monk twinkie with a level 60 Cleric behind him is chewing up the death beetles like a fat man on a hotdog.<P>So much of the game is whining and complaining, debating of spawn points and spawns. Powerleveling does nothing but foster this environment.<P>However, can Verant do anything about it? I don't think so. Maybe a +/- 15 level buff limit, but that would take up a good deal of Rowyl's time. (unless, of course, you don't want to cast any spells on any MOBs 15 levels below you? farmers would be outraged, and quests would be even worse to undertake then.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If anyone sees you pleveling, word spreads like wildfire and you get tell hell from buff requests/plevel requests<P>I usually end up giving out free wolf wherever I'm pleveling(I'm a nice guy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )..and...I can't say that anyone has EVER refused a buff saying "Um, nothanks, I don't believe in powerleveling"<P>This thread was started by someone with plevel envy. <P>Like it or not, people are gonna be pleveled(you don't as you've told us, at least as long as it isn't YOU being pleveled you don't). <P>Pleveling isn't all great stuff, it can turn you into a sucky player(no real exp).<P>Same thing with twinking only worse  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> You see, if you wanna tell me that i can't buy my alt eq with spare cash, I'm gonna tell you to stick it where the sun don't shine.<P>Verant's said it before, they'll probably say it again- In this game there are the "Haves" and the "Have Nots"<P>My own addition is : "If the Have Nots would get off their sorry tushes and work a little they would be Haves too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> "<P>Dadi Shortpimp<BR>Druid of the 77th coffee pot<BR>Warrior of the 55th twink<BR>Warrior of the 68th twink<BR>Mage of the 30th twink</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>only times i have problems with power leveling is when 3 level 10s and one level 60 clear the entire damn place and dont leave anything for anyone else. then i try to pull respawn and then get yelled at by the level 60 saying if i steal anymore kills then he will just kill them all again. course i didnt steal  anything i just grabbed an open yard respawn. oh well, pleveling is ok just leave some for the people who actually play.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's a people problem, not a powerlevelling problem.<P>Powerlevelling should be done in little used zones.  SRO orc camps, for instance, are a good choice.  EC orc camps aren't.<P>A person with respect to others will go to a little or non-used place and power level there.  Two reasons for that: One is that it doesn't take mobs from others and Two because others don't take mobs from you.  A popular place like oasis or the lake of ill omen are relatively poor powerleveling places as there are too many people competing for spawns.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050251-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050251-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050251&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050251&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
