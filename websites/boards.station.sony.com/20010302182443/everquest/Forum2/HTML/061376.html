</FONT><HR>Last night, on The Rathe...my guildmate was up in level 8 of the Tower of Frozenshadows when a GM kills him, then suspends his account.<P>After hearing what happened, our officers began trying to petition a GM to find out what happened, of course to no avail.  Later, we found out that he had been in an arguement with a character named Province, and had been defending his sister over some issue.<P>Now I will grant, that the suspension *may* have been deserved if the argument got heated, after all he was defending his sister.  What I can not accept, is the fact that the GM killed him, left his corpse in level 8 of the Tower, and the suspended, not banned, his account.<P>What does this mean? This means that when the account suspension is lifted, the GM will have caused him to lose all his items.  No small thing, since he is a level 52 warrior and has gotten some decent gear.<P>Oh, and this person he was arguing with, at last check had nothing done against him, and was nice enough to email bomb my guildmate's sister later that same night.<P>-Thaldin, The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That is my complaint.  My complaint isn't with the suspension.  Even I admit, he may have deserved it if the argument got heated, we all lose our cool.<P>My complaint is with the fact, that regardless of how he died (though more so if he died by GM hands, and I have no reason to doubt my guildmate, he's always been a straight forward guy), that they are knowingly causing him to lose all his stuff, since it is only a suspension and not a ban.<P>-Thaldin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>if you want to know why well it seems mostly because most GMs are age 20 or younger and love being on a powertrip, their the ones who were beat up in school alot and want to get at everyone so they decide to take it out on the playerbase. the problem is most of them could care less about the players and care only abot what havoc they can create for the players in one night.  i find that the guides are the nice people to bad they arnt the ones with the power.<P>if verants CS dosent do anything and your friend has a log showing that nothing extremely bad was done or said then taske it directly to sonys CS they'll handle it most probably by getting rid of the GM, verant doesnt care but sony will they have good CS.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok...so let's see...we have no details and only second or even third hand information that a GM (?) killed a player then suspended him for a week thus causing him to loose all of his items.<BR> Sorry..not buying it. You get suspended after receiving three warnings which means your ever so innocent guildmate had a record and if he was causing a problem that then warranted a suspension it would happen immediately, regardless of where in the game he was or what his situation was. The GM has no reason to care that some MOB has just killed the rule-breaker and thus has no reason to allow him time to loot.<BR>His job is to enforce the rules that your friend broke and to take action.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First, you should not HAVE to show a GM respect, I show respect to most all people(except when roleplay, those dang lighties  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ). But If a person doesnt think another deserves his respect, GM or not, he should not be REQUIRED to treat him that way. He may need punishing if he swears or something, but he shouldnt have to bow to a GM and call him sir for fear of banning, thats communism.<P>This kind of thing is not unheard of.

</FONT><HR>Firstly, preventing someone from looting their corpse and hence losing all equipment is not fair. <P>If the original problem was enough to warrant a suspension then fine (GM's are their for game issues not rl issues). But, if that causes a massive side effect (in this case loss of equip) then that should be sorted out IMHO.<P>Of course this particular scene has not been played out to the end yet. There is the possibility that he will get equipment reinstated when the account suspension is lifted.

Verant has admitted the wrongdoing on more than one occasion, but usually only after a very large number of people post here about it.
