</FONT><HR>What Am I doing Wrong? <BR>Everyone I talk to says that Druids Can't Tank. I have been very successful as a tank for a group when no Warior or Hybrids were available, Just meant a little longer downtime, and closer cooperation with the casters.<P>Everyone I talk to says Druids Can't be effective Healers. I've never had a party member die because I couldn't heal him as Group healer in the last 9 months I've played a Druid. Just takes me a little more mana than a Cleric, and Knowledge of the Strengths and Weaknesses of my Party members.<P>Everyone I talk to says Druids Can't burn like Casters. I guess I can stop blasting with my Burst of Flame series, and Whirling wind series spells. I guess that timing my casts, as well as giving the tanks a slight head start on damage was all a waste of time. I guess I was wrong on my assumption that Druids were just slightly less effective Burn Mages, but still useful.<P>Here I was all this time, Controling Pulls with Harmony and Rooting, Buffing Party Members with Damage Shields, Stacking Dots with Necros, and All this other stuff that I thought was helpful, to be told that I was wasting my time.<P>Tracking, SOW, Group Teleports, I always thought that these made helping groups find and finish quests so much easier. I guess I was wrong.<P>Gee I guess I've been playing my Druid Wrong all this time. I never realized how much of a weak pathetic class I play. All this time I thought I was the king of versatility, and instead I find out that my class is useless, and none of the friends I've met online wanted to group with me.<P>Wow, Thanks for the Info. I think I'm going to Delete my Character and try something else.<P>MJL<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>A lot of the perspective you mention comes from higher level play. At low levels anyone can take some hits from mobs and be ok to some extent, but at high levels you better have full plate and a ton of hitpoints if you are going to try to stand toe to toe with mob's and absorb damage.<P>Druids aren't good as *primary* healers in most situations. At lvl 40 as a warrior I have around 1800 hp's buffed. A cleric of equal level can complete heal me for 400 mana. Or...superior heal me which will give close to 600hps for 250 mana. A druid in the group will only be able to heal 300hps at a time and will go out of mana in a hurry if they are trying to heal multiple members in the group. This difference just gets even more pronounced the higher you go...<P>But being a tank or the primary healer is not what most people want in a druid. Druids are GREAT in a group. Regen, damage shields, evac, sow, teleports, backup healing, some buffs, decent nuking ability, etc, etc. Not to mention one of the most important abilities in a dungean: Snare. <P>Anyone who tells you druids can't contribute to a group probably hasn't grouped with a good one. :-)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Actually my post was meant to be Sarcastic, pointing out the Versatility and effectiveness of a Druid.  Just trying to vent at my frustrations at all the player misconceptions that are limiting my enjoyment of the game.<P>The problem is there is enough people griping about Druids and what they can and can't do that unfortunately too many people who should know better are starting to believe them.  <P>Clerics Can and Should always be better more efficient healers than Druids.  But a Druid can and will be a great choice for Primary Healer if No Cleric is Available.<P>Just about any of the Melee Classes Are Better Tanks than Druids, So a Druid should almost Never Tank in a Group.  But Dispite the No Plate armor limitation, with the Proper Buffs a Druid has better AC and HP than a Caster, and with proper Training of your Casters, A Druid is a better choice for Tank than to Not have one.  Though I'd put Druids in this Order as Priority for Tanks, Melee Class, Summoned Pets, then Druids.  <P>(Note I've found that I've needed to clarify in the past when I've talked with others.  By Tanking I mean Focusing the Attacks of the opposing mobs uppon yourself therfore recieving the Majority of the Damage, to allow the Casters and Healers of the Party to Work without risk or interuption from the opposing mobs)<P>And you're Right Druids are best Utilized by being everyone's Backup #2 man in the party, and being Backup Healer, and Backup Nuker, and First and ForMost, Snaring and Buffing as Appropriate.<P>On a funny note at least in my opinion.  There is one thing I will admit that I can't do, no matter how much I try.  I just can't get the Knack of Kiting down with any of my Druids.  I know it can be done, I know it is possible, but I always seem to end up OOM, and Out of Luck with the Mob still having at least a bubble and a Half Health left with all my DOTs worn off.  And with all the Work involved even if it did somehow fall over dead, after all that time and work, I could have gotten 3 times the Xp in the same amount of time if I had just bothered to join a group anywhere.<P>mjl.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>We druids do indeed ROCK =)<P>As far as tanking goes...well I think that worked for me for maybe the first 8 levels...the higher and higher you get forget about it...you are asking for a corpse retrieval there.<P>For healing, druids are awesome backup healers and can also stand in nicely as primary healer if there is no cleric around. Granted I would not want to be the primary healer at my level in a group, but still would be able to manage.<P>As far as nuking goes, well true we do not have the highest damage nukes in the game, but those lvl 49 nukes look awful tempting right now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>And we can compliment the primary nuker in any group quite nicely.<P>Druids are IMO the best all around character in the game and has been my favorite class to play by far  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Now if I could just get my little paws on a paw hehe.<P>Holyhawk <BR>Druid of the 46th leaf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000098&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000098&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
