</FONT><HR>Just because someone suggests that too many parents have abandoned their necessary role of teaching, mentoring and educating their kids, does not suggest them being a Bircher.  I'm pretty well to the left on the political spectrum, and I wholeheartedly agree with RunDMZ.  I've been to schools and seen what kids do these days.  I've been in public and seen kids disrespectful of their parents, and the complete lack of any response.  Parents need to start being parents, not friends.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It is simply that children are not being guided into adulthood, not being taught anything about personal responsibility, courtesy, or (dare I say) unselfishness. This means that many children are growing up to be children, at which point the vicious circle truly begins because those grown-up sized children have children and it is extremely difficult for a child to guide a child into adulthood.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

"Maybe I misunderstood, I thought he claimed he got a message via /tell or /guild.  I didn't think it was close to rotting.  No one else rolled, so I didn't see the trigger to do so.  I apologize for overreacting, but their conduct was still wrong."<P>I think the likelihood of his response is in the order presented.

</FONT><HR>Ask Gazz what he said about the group prior to me getting there.  <P>I guess he skipped over the part where the cleric (happened to be in the same guild as the looter) in the group was pissed that the level 60 cleric wanted the level 39 cleric "ToU" spell.  This caused the 60th cleric to leave the group.  Keep in mind, before I even got there this group managed to piss off a level 60 cleric!!!!  Post that log Gazz!<P>The fact of the matter is 2 people agree to ROLL.  I dont roll during a pull when its time for me to heal! In fact I wasnt even talking much except for when I asked "roll??" because loot should be second to the group right?  Then its also funny how they send private tells to the paladin and completely ignore me after I did say I wanted to roll.<P>Look guys, Gazz knows me RL for almost 15 years.  We BOTH have hot tempers (he QUIT his guild as a result of morons in EQ.. Not unheard of to quit, problem is he was the guild leader! hehe), and believe me when I see something I don't like, I will state my mind!  And when im wrong I also DO apologize.  I treat others based on how I am treated.<P>What Gazz "convieniently" left out was the phone conversation where he told me "how big of a loser" (more or less) this Infiniti cleric was for pissing off the level 60 cleric AND NOT doing her job as a healer. How Gazz was pissed he took a level 39 res due to incompetence.  Then WHY ON EARTH did gazz keep the fool in the group??  In any case I went there EXPECTING (based on Gazz phone conversation) a jerk or 2 in the group.  Lets just say this sorta set the "mood" for the night, you dont see this in the log of course.<P>In RL im a nice guy, until you screw me. Then you will regret it for sure.  Im old enough to have a great job, been married for 20 years, have 2 kids 18 & 16 y/o's, and have worked for some very large software developers in my career as an engineer.  So what you say? How is this relevant to EQ?  Im just letting you know that my attitude works VERY well in real life, in fact im respected.  Why? Because im not a [EXPLETIVE], and I can walk the walk, I don't just talk the talk.  Im honest and up front. And when I am wrong (I wasnt in this case), I do admit so.  This seems to work very well in REAL LIFE, so why not a game.<P>This attitude extends into the game.  Basically if you want my respect you earn it.  Treat me as you wish me to treat you.  Screw me once, I will screw you three times.  Treat me with respect and I will go out of my way to help you.  In fact when im bored (alot lately) I make it a point to head into a zone and help other players.  I have also tried to do very simple player run quests.  And when I am doing my job as a cleric, I do it well IMO.  And for the 3-4 people I piss off in the game, I have 10 times that many acqaintences and friends.<P>Again, the log appears to be accurate, but it is unfortunatly out of context! You cannot see the problems they had prior to me even coming there. And you cannot see how they forced a 60th cleric to leave the group.<P>How could this have been avoided?<BR>1) Group leader should always make the loot rules known up front so this dont happen.<BR>2) If you break the rules you are warned. Break it again you are gone.<P>Anyone who tries to sit here and say they never seen a argument over loot (if its good loot or not its not the point) is a liar   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Side note: I talked to the 60th cleric last night and unfortunatly ToU never dropped   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  This spell seems to be ultra rare! Kind of strange for a level 39 spell that isnt really all that powerful (400hp undead cleric DoT).<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>"Do you guys care about anything other than loot???"<P>Apparently the others in the group were even more concerned with the loot than I. Why? Because before I got there a 60th cleric quit because of a loot argument!<P>Now before I even went there I knew the 60th cleric would get the spell if it dropped, I wanted it that way!  But this doesnt mean that if other stuff does happen to drop that I can use, I want to be left out.<P>Its not the loot so much as the attitude. And again Gazz left out the entire issue that resulted in an argument WAY BEFORE I EVEN GOT THERE! He also left out the part where the cleric wasnt doing her job, which is WHY they came to get me.<P>This group was doomed long before I got there.  But what happened before I did sorta set the mood because I was told ahead of time at least 1 jerk was in the group.  This is the only reason why I came down hard when this person looted after I stated my interest.<P>I'd rather not group with people like that..<P>And btw, nobody died when I got there. I am a very good cleric!  They DID die with this other cleric prior to me coming.. So don't even start about my abilities because you know jack.<P>And I tell you what... Next time you are in a group, something drops, and one other person wants in on it, just loot the item. Watch how fast people complain about you!<P>Look at the damn log! The pulls were constant and almost always more than one mob!  This was not your typical kill mob x and play around for a few minutes while resting while you /roll.  I "thought" they were going to stop pulling so we could /roll! And I assume that the looter probably thought so too!  But instead of asking, he just took it because he claims in a private tell he was told too.  Bah..<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
