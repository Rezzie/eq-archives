</FONT><HR>FireStaff,<P>Rather than posting your opinion please explain how you feel Chloroblast will unbalance Rallos Zek when the spell is simply a faster casting greater heal. Do you feel a greater heal is sufficent for healing 55+ when most mobs do much more than 300 damage? Or in any way will out perform a damage spell a 55 Wizard can cast?<P>Please explain how you reached the conclusion that the laughable 55 pet makes the druids a pet class. Please, Please, enlighten me on how the weakest pet in the game and one that can only be summoned for the last five levels of a druids life is something that makes the class better.<P>By that logic every class is a pet class, the wizard and cleric pets have as much functionality as the druid.<P>Myself I think that Wizards having the only spells that will do full damage through 300 sv fire and 300 sv cold is the real problem on Rallos. Try that with a druid and enjoy the 75 damage your wildfire does.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Furbie:  SHeal is hardly a solution.  It negligibly bumps up the healing ability, but not significantly enough that a 55-60 group is gonna be able to do anything with a couple druids/shaman doing nothing but healing.  This isn't a question about balance, but need.  How is it imbalanced if we remain second-best healers, but that the gap just narrows a bit?<P>Druids chose to be healers a lot.  In my pre-30 groups, this was the role I was asked to play more often than nuking.  I liked it more, so chose alteration when the time arose (soon after RoK and long before the gap was realized).  In the 40's that is also true, until we get lucky and a cleric shows up.  In the 50's, no way in heck.  So I should be penalized after 16 months of play and 40 some odd days, because Verant changed the game?  Does that sound right to you?<P>Yeah, Druids rock in melee!  ROFLMAO  Now you just sound like you are parroting all the druid rants you've read without any actual experience, and decided to add your own twist so it's not so obvious.<P>You claim this change will trivialize clerics.  How?  If a group is without a healer, and they find a free druid or cleric, do you really think they're gonna take the druid?  If any group was foolish enough to do that, did you really want to be part of that group?<P>Why do you insist on marginalizing this change by claiming it was whining by druids that resulted in it?  Sure, many druids/shaman complained that their healing role was absent after 50.  But, the largest outcry I've read on this board has been from the other 11 classes who've been stuck shouting, "KC group looking for cleric."  Not "looking for healer" but "cleric" alone.  How is that justified that other players don't get to play simply because one of 14 classes isn't present?<P>Where was the irony or sarcasm?  Again, it sounds like you are parroting what you read.  Where did I flame anyone.  I answered questions and corrected errors tersely in one word, because the same allegations and paranoia had been stated over and over.  I never criticized anyone for simply having the opinion that we shouldn't be healers (despite our pre-50 role and our priest class).  I criticized those who had as the basis the fact that we all suck, are overpowered, or should have to pay for soloing pre-50 by doing nothing after that.<P>Why should healing, a core need in every group, be the sole province of one class?  Shouldn't there be alternatives?  There are alternatives in melee, nuking, crowd control, mana regen.  Why should healing, which is more important than any of those, be any different?  <P>No clerics are gonna leave over this.  That'd be silly.  You'll still be highly desired in any group without a healer.  It won't be instant like it used to, but I'm sure you aren't really selfish enough to think that a 5-person group really should wait an hour for you to show up even if there is a druid or shaman LFG.  Instead of insta-group, you may have to wait a few minutes for there aren't groups stacking up at the zone line.  That sounds fair, right?<P>The power-grabbing argument is foolish and more of an effort to marginalize.  It also ignores the other 11 classes complaining about the lack of healers.  I don't want to be a cleric.  I like being a utility player.  One of those utilities is absent post-50, and it's the one that is the most needed by groups.  I'm not going to become a cleric.  I've spent 16 months and 40 odd days getting to where I am.  I have no interest in becoming a newbie again.  Why should 1000's of players be forced to spend another 1000 hours of their lives on EverCrack, just because Verant forgot to round out druids/shaman?<P>It's funny for you to call this selfish on our part, while you are the one trying to deny 13 other classes the opportunity to play the game if 1 class isn't present.  It's short-sighted and paranoid to think that this will harm you in any way.<P>Why aren't there more clerics?  I've answered this one a few times.  1.  There are a good number, but they are only 1 of 14 classes trying to fill 1 in 6 groups slots.  2.  They are somewhat monotonous to play, due to the limited role.  That's Verant's fault, not druids.  Visit Cleric Talk for ways to fix this.  3.  They aren't as fun, because if they are just healing, they aren't killing stuff.  We like virtual blood, and clerics don't get much.<P>You still haven't answered the question, surprisingly enough:  Is it fair that the gameplay of 13 classes should be dependent upon the presence of 1?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Slayer:  You won't rez a quad-kiting druid?  How about a wizard?  How about a solo necro who is doing the next best thing to quad-kiting?  How about a group using pathing to exploit?  You've bought into some silly lies and exagerations if you think quadding is so great.  I've done it.  It isn't.<P>How is a group at 55 supposed to work together without a cleric at present?  If you are so l33t, mind explaining it for the rest of us.  When 4 druids with SHeal can't keep a warrior alive, I'll be really curious what you suggest.<P>Sure, there are some groups foolish enough that they insist upon having only the specialist/best classes.  However, for the rest of us, we accept alternatives all the time.  Hybrids, bards, other nukers.  But there is no alternative to healing.  There is no second best that can still do the job.  If you are gonna rely on the druid to heal, you'd better have a cleric handy for rez.  And if he's handy, he'll be in the group, not me.<P>We understand we aren't a wizard, enchanter or cleric.  Please point me to a druid post where they want to be equal to any of those, and I'll go visit the thread and flame them like everyone else.  I haven't seen it.  I don't want to be equal to a cleric.  I want two druids or shaman to be able to keep a group alive nearly as well.  That doesn't sound overpowering to me.<P>Like Furbie and some others, you need to pull your head out of the sand on who is clamouring for the upgrade.  Druids/shaman were only half of the those asking for it.  Stop marginalizing the upgrade by claiming it was only us "whining."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here is the problem.<P>Scenario 1:<BR>39th+ Cleric grouped with 60th Warrior.<BR>Ratio: 1 mana for 7-12 points using Complete Healing.<P>Scenario 2:<BR>60th Shaman grouped with 60th Warrior.<BR>Ratio: 1 mana for about 2.3 points using Superior Healing.<P>Conclusion: In this scenario, a 39th level cleric is a better healer than a 60th shaman.  This is due to their best healing spell being up to five times more powerful than the healing spell shamans get at 53rd level.<P>Q: But can't the shaman can cast Torpor?<BR>A: No.  Look at the casting time of torpor and it's serious negative effects.<P>Q: But can't the shaman slow the mob?<BR>Answers:<BR>1) No. Most 55+ mobs cannot be slowed.<BR>2) Many mobs are spellcasters.  Slow isn't going to help any against them.<BR>3) A single resist means the death of the shaman unless there is due to uncontrollable aggro.<P>Q: What about cripple?<BR>A: PvP spell only.  No noticable effect on mobs.<P>Q: Can't the shaman cannibalize to have a larger mana pool?<BR>A: No.  When a shaman is actively healing a tank they are chain casting Superior Healing in an attempt to keep up with mob damage.<P>Q: So what if we give shamans another healing spell to fizzle at 55th level, similar to Remedy?<BR>A: You've upped the shaman healing ratio from 2.3 to 2.5.

Keep a few things in mind here. Clerics get any shared healing spell many levels earlier than any other class. Clerics have a larger variety of healing spells to choose from, making them much more flexible in their healing powers. Clerics are also innately better healers than any other class. They will heal more hit points with the same spell than any other class (they have a built in bonus on all their healing)."<BR> <BR>Aradune said, "NO one item should be necessary to be victorious in an expansion, or even significant parts of an expansion..." (This should of course apply to a single SPELL and also to a single CLASS)<BR> <BR>Search the threads for "Mudflation" and "Mobflation" and it will become very clear that you don't want more healing in EverQuest.

</FONT><HR>I like some of your ideas EvilChu, but CHeal is necessary.  It would take a complete retool of the Epic encounters to permit the game to work without it.  I don't think it is so imbalancing.  The few times that require CHeal, are times that you can't specifically set up and arrange to have a cleric available.  I don't think it should be removed.  It's the primary thing which gives clerics the edge they need.  More efficiency and lower levels on the Heals helps them, too, but CHeal is both necessary and integral.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, that would seem to be the case as well under your modified spell lists.  If in the old world with manastones, even easier.  If everyone was fully buffed with ClarTwo and Damage Shields, etc., even epic mobs would go down pretty easy to such a group.  3 players vs a Full Party is a whole different animal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>No one will ever read this, but why why why do classes want to monopolize the market on something?  Why cant everyone play?  Clerics getting upset that dru/shams want to heal???  Why should us tanks be so dependant on clerics.  Gimme a break, the game will be sooo much better if you really could substitute several different classes for one another.  It might actually be .... dare i say ... fun?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just have 2 questions then.<P>If remedy/divine light are the "core" spells of the cleric class why are all the clerics freaking out over the aggro change which realistically only applies to the use of CH?You can't have it both ways if CH is'nt core and "rarely used" then the aggro change has little bearing on you.If it actually is a "core" spell then stop pretending it is'nt.<P>How exactly does the addition of a faster casting heal spell which heals less then SH for less mana and a slightly faster casting time suddenly make clerics useless?Fact is chloroblast has had ZERO effect on my grouped gameplay it has only been a slight benefit when soloing and cann dancing.<P>Bottom line had I never gotten it I would be no better nor worse off then I am now.I still slow/mal things thats what I do you clerics who go on and on ad nauseum about how unfair it is that if you have 2 shaman/druids in a group you are obsolete must be being deliberately obtuse.2 shamans can't replace you beacause ONE shaman is still doing what he has ALWAYS done as his primary role if hes in a group slowing and malxxx so it would require 3 shamans to replace you somehow I don't think thats that efficient do you?And if so please explain how as my Barbarian brain is obviously too small to grasp it.<P>Tsorath Ravenspirit<BR>58 shaman<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
