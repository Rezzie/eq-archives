For many of the same reasons that we made recent changes to the Donal's Breastplate, we are going to make some changes to these items with the next patch (which will be next week).<BR>Existing instances of these Plane of Growth breastplates will have the casting time for Celestial Elixer increased to one minute.<P>No new instances of the Plane of Growth breastplates will occur (they will stop dropping).<P>In places where the Plane of Growth breastplates were being created (off of NPC corpses or as the result of quests) new breastplates will be created.<P>Basically, the existing breastplates are having their casting times increased and they won't be dropping anymore, new breastplates will take their place.<P>I'm sorry that these items are being changed so long after their introduction. But this is something that we feel needs to be done for the integrity of gameplay in EverQuest.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>im sorry but i have to agree with the nerf.  its jus a couple breatsplates which now determine if someone can kill an uber mob or not.  Items alone should not be the determining factor of uber battles.  Clerics are stil lthe best healers, and if anyone remmbers, they said they would nerf the bp's AND the uber-mobs! they mentioned that back with donal's.  anyone who quits a great game that, althought everyone is quick to point out the downfalls, has many advantages over any other game out there is making a mistake.  Now i cant judge those new games that are comin out like anarchy and all, but i doubt they will top eq b/c of the years of updates and upgrades tha have balanced this game as much as they have</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok i have the perfect solution to this, its very simple. Make the BP cast a version of symbol of naltron that cannot be recast on the player until the buff has worn off. This will make it useful to buff everyone with less mana and downtime so they will have fun but will keep people from abusing it as a heal. And don't BS us and say you can't do this beacuse you did it with complete heal already. This could be done in many ways, group hero, group naltron, single target naltron, single target hero just make sure it can't be recast until the buff wears off. Wow you think after the complete heal on donals was fixed they would have done somethign like this instantly<P>Ganthorn FlamingFists   (56 Conjurer)<BR>Ganthornx Bigpimpin     (46 Paladin)<BR>Fhallin Downalot        (37 Monk)<BR>Stabberific Sneakytheif (27 Rogue)<BR>Grooberman Mistanote    (26 Bard)<P>Ya ya i play too much<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>FYI in my point of view though I loved the breastplate and gained several levels because of it in conjunction with manastone.  The item was way overpowered I just wish people in verant used their freaking brains *BEFORE* they added the item.  You say the person who made the breastplate was level 50 cleric in an uberguild?  And you say he 'didnt know how unbalanced it'd be'<P>Robocop says, "I'll buy that for a dollar"<P>Giving a level 59 spell effect to an item obtainable at level 46.  GEE?  What were you thinking!<P>Even the Epic weapon which is something glorious to obtain only casts a spell thats 6 levels higher then its possible to achieve.<P>--Hire me as person in charge of wizards I'd be fair and actually have a clue what would be overpowered or not.

</FONT><HR>So far I have read almost everything in all 3 threads...   Here is my conclusion on the matter.<P>1) I have yet to see a valid point made by Verant to justify the removal/replacement of these BP's.<BR>-300 hp's every 6 seconds for 24 seconds... Hello...  That in itself does not justify the removal/revamp of these BP's.<BR>-The fact that you can chain cast this with little to no risk of being aggro'd does not justify the removal/revamp either.<BR>So Verant please justify (if possible) this change<P>2) All of you "customers" who keep threatening in childish manners that you are leaving...  Well, sorry, but, Goodbye...   <BR>-The fact is that if the amount of people who leave because of this change, happens... well, that just makes camping MOBs a little bit easier for all the rest of us...<BR>-I hope that you don't leave, but if you do, that is your choice and Verant did not make you do it like you all are implying.<P>3) And yes there are other MMORPG's on the way...  So what...  they are not here yet...  so quit with the whining and threats of moving to the "New" games when they aren't even out yet...<P>My main point here is that this change doesn't seem to have a reasonable excuse as to why it is happening and I really haven't read anyone (except for a few) posting anything but flames against Verant and how they are leaving the game.<P>Be more productive about what you post by placing your concerns about the topic and what you would like to see happen.  THAT is what these forums are for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>Please tell me if your vision of the cleric is to just sit, stand, heal, sit, repeat in that order for 45 minutes and then buff.  IS THAT THE FREAKING VISION?  How about you guys come up with something FUN for the cleric class instead of constantly thinking up new nerfs.<P>I've been playing this game since day 1 release and I'm so sick of the way you guys have made the high end game (raids, gods, dragons, etc..). It's absolutely retarded with the travel time, buff time, horrible LD's with over 30 people, the uselessnes of a majority of classes in the battle, etc..  <P>Instead of trying to come up with creative ideas to make classes more FUN or the game MORE FUN you guys are still focused on nerfs. What the heck was the point of asking people to come up with class improvements? You haven't even moved on ONE of them.<P>Why do I stay???? Because I love MMORPG's on a big scale. I'm like the majority of your customer base now. I'm just waiting for next MMORPG to come out.  Asheron's Call didn't break EQ because EQ was still new and people had a lot of time into their characters and were just getting to the high end game.  The next game out will break EQ.<P>Another pissed of Cleric who keeps getting nerfed<P>56 cleric<BR>Tholuxe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant continues to play the bitter Dungeon master with this game.  God forbid that we had a way to beat mobs that flurry for 300s, or quad for 850s.  Never mind you that while making the game for the top notch players on any server, you are making it impossible for the rest of us.  <P>Please be so kind as to remove all the mobs you have flagged unsnarable/rootable (even tho they arent MR), the gating/CHing UNSTUNNABLE mobs, the mobs that AE dispell, and all the other mobs that totally rape players without missing a step.  THEN come back and tell us that this BP was overpowered.  <P>Do you really think this game is too easy?  Can you honestly pose such an argument without using the Uberguilds of Mith Marr and Veeshan etc as your only examples?  If you cant, and i KNOW you cant, then nerfing the game to make it more difficult for them is totally unjustified.  Wake up and see how ****ed up you are acting with these nerfs, and how to spoil the fun of .05% of the population that tears up your encouters, you are alienating the rest of your non-uber guilds.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am wary of getting into this discussion because I have the utmost respect for Aenae and all the clerics I have encountered on Luclin, but there is one point to make a comment on in zurians post.  It is this paragraph here...<P>&gt;&gt;Please tell me if your vision of the cleric is to just sit, stand, heal, sit, repeat in that order for 45 minutes and then buff. IS THAT THE FREAKING VISION? How about you guys come up with something FUN for the cleric class instead of constantly thinking up new nerfs.&lt;&lt;<P>In particular I have objection with the first sentence.  Clerics are not the only class that sits, meds, casts, sits, meds, casts add nauseum.  There is at least one other class that does this and that is the wizard class.  Of course you bring more to the group than just healing, a wizard brings almost nothing to a group except for nuking (and evacing in the rare case something goes awry).  I can guarantee that the tank you just complete healed for 400 mana can do a hell of a lot more damage on a full tank of health than my ice comet does for its 400 mana.<P>I agree that Verant is being particularly harsh on clerics right now, but have you taken a step back and looked at the fact that clerics have had it pretty good for a long time.  For the first year and a half since release clerics have been the undisputed masters of healing.  This fact was undeniable.  Clerics are still the masters of healing.  Even with the changes, clerics continue to be what the wizard class SHOULD be to magical damage.  Nerfs hurt I agree, but this is not the end of the world.<P>For those of you who say that Verant will lose all its customer base when something new comes along, that was said before Asheron's Call was released, and that was said before Diablo 2 was released and here Everquest still remains as the champion of the online RPG universe.  I doubt there will ever be a perfect online RPG out there on the market because every customer wants something different from a game.  In spite of the fact my class is horribly understrengthed and I honestly see no true fixes in sight, I will continue to play Everquest.  Why?  Because its a beautiful game.  The world of Norrath is full of beauty and wonder if you open your eyes to see it.  Its not a perfect world, but it is a good world.<P>I'm not in an uber guild.  I would never have adventured with anyone on a regular basis who had these items affected.  Does that mean that these items shouldn't be changed because they won't effect me personally?  If the people who created this visually stunning and incredibly addicting game think its for the best, then who am I to disagree with them.  Yes I am the paying customer, but that doesn't give me the inherant right to a stagnant game that the designers feel needs fixes.  If I wanted a stagnant game like that I'd play my old copy of Might and Magic 6 before doing any patching.  What I want is a game that evolves and changes...and in changing sometimes things swing to far in one direction and must swing back in the other.  Nerfs hurt for every class, but if the people at Verant Interactive feel that this move is in the best interest of the longevity of the game, I as a customer of the most popular online roleplaying game in history think its a good move too.<P>Vallaran Mistwalker<BR>Fellowship of Luclin<BR>Flame retardant wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm generally an optimistic person, but this latest nerf will have a very good chance of ending this game for very many players.  Players who have paid their money each and every month, players who have invested their time, players who work hard to make their game play time actually mean something.  We're talking Verant's customer base here...the people who's money and time have kept this game alive.<P>These are the people Verant is hurting with this nerf.  Not just the clerics, but also their group members, their guildmates, and their friends.<P>That's a huge amount of people that are being effected in a negative way.  <P>I do not play a cleric.  I play a lvl 60 enchanter on the Tribunal server.  It has taken a long time to get to lvl 60, and in that time a majority of it has been spent grouping with one cleric.<P>I was with this cleric when MoK was nerfed to uselessness.  I was with this cleric when he received his Donal's BP.  I was with him when it was nerfed the first time...and again when it was nerfed the second time.  I've seen him go from being a person who truly loved his class to someone who is frustrated and tired of working hard to achieve goals, only to have them taken away.<P>From the first week SoV went live we (myself, this cleric, and our friends on the Tribunal server) have worked very hard in completing the armor quests.  I cannot even begin to figure out the minutes/hours/days/weeks we have spent on these quests.  <P>Last weekend, this cleric received his Breastplate of Forbidden Rites, the first on any server.  The completion of a goal that we as friends worked very hard for.  That same week we completed two other class BP's and two other Robe quests.   <P>These were long term goals that were finally completed, and the feeling we had at the end of the week was one of happiness, fulfillment, and satisfaction.  <P>Verant is now nerfing this breasplate that this cleric has had for one week.  After all the time and effort put into it, he has gotten to enjoy the reward for about 5 days before hearing of the nerf.  Not only that, but because Verant is not replacing what will become a useless breastplate with the new version (whatever it is), we get to start over in getting this cleric, one of my dearest friends, his replacement.<P>More time, more work.  Finding another bp and more gems to loot to complete what we've already done once.<P>I fear that he will decide it's not worth it and  click the cancel button.  If he does, so do I.  So do many other people I can think of.  <P>My friends leave this game, it's over for me.  Each player has their own group of friends, it's like a paper chain...we're all woven together at this point.  If a large group of people leave, it will have a domino effect, player base will diminish, the game will end.  I believe clerics will leave over this, as well their friends and their friends and their friends.<P>It's sad it has to end because of a nerf that shouldn't even happen.  It's even sadder that player time, committment, and money means so little to the people that make these decisions.<P>I disagree with this nerf as strongly as I can...I disagree that the clerics who have spent days on end in Plane of Growth, or in this case, questing, have to start all over again in hopes of replacing what will soon be useless.  You take something away that was earned, you should replace it.<P>Think very carefully about what this nerf could mean to the game and if the nerf happens, think again about those that will lose what they already earned and have to start over.<P>It's just wrong.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The item was obviously meant for healing or it would not have had a healing effect put on it, but Verant obviously didn't realize the ramifications of this amount of manaless healing in the high level game or else these changes would not be happening in the way they are.  I dare any of you to post here and say you've never made a mistake and done something that seems like a good idea at the time but there was something that happened that you didn't fully expect.  <P>I don't think there's a person alive who can claim they haven't made mistakes and only a fool or someone who doesn't care would avoid trying to correct a mistake when they find one.  While some people might think of the people at Verant as the former, they can't be accused of not caring or else the changes to these items would not take place.  If you want a static and unchanging game, there are plenty of them out there on the market to play.  I could name you 50 games easily that have been out for years that haven't changed in years.  They don't get "nerfed", and they don't get enhanced.  You can level your characters in your own private world to your hearts content.  You can own your own "spawns", you can use hacks and cheats and every other thing you can think of possible to "beat" the game.  I don't play Everquest because I want one of those games.  If you want a game that evolves and changes, then this is a game for that.  Mistakes will be made, because no one is perfect.  If you claim to be perfect, then you can design your own game to play.<P>Vallaran Mistwalker<BR>Fellowship of Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, i went through all those posts and didnt see a single good one.  Im just wondering when theyre going to nerf warriors... we have too many hp.  And Rogues deal too much damage.  Dont forget wizards.  They deal too much damage too.  And the proc on Painbringer pulls too much taunt, nerf that.  Ykesha?  it interrupts spells.  Nerf that.   I dont want this to sound like a flame, it isnt.  Im just wondering when clerics are going to get a useful item and not have it nerfed.  As a 58 cleric and a 54 warrior, i can attest to this BP not being overpowered before.  Without an extra cleric healing my warrior, the BP heal took too much time for too little a heal to be efficient.  I could use it to PL in Sol B on bats or whatnot, but i could get a druid to do the same thing more efficiently.  I dont see how the effect needs nerfed, but Hey, what do i know... just been playing a cleric for almost 2 years.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>300 hp every six seconds is nothing. I take more damage than that in 1 hit. And normally, it's not 1 hit, it's double/tripple/quadrupple hits for 300, 650, 850, whatever.<P>This BP was mostly good for reducing downtime or healing people after a rez. Occasionally, it was nice for when the cleric in an exp group was OOM and medding up for a "real heal". I don't see how that's imbalancing. They are clerics, its their job. If you'd put this effect on the warrior BP, there may have been cause for concern...<P>shazariahl, 57 wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Cleric don't get much to look foward too...  all we do on Dragon and Veious raids is heal and buff, heal, buff and rinse and repeat.  Dragon's don't drop crap for us and neither does most the other raids we go on cept poG raids......  As a clerics with the epic and damn near full PoG armor with the BP that you are about to Nerf, I haven;t gotten anything on a dragon raid since I won the cleric hammer from Vox literally about 1 2/2 year ago.<P>Second of all, that BP was about the ONLY thing besides my epic that I had to look foward to.  I spent literally over 20 DAYS i PoG just to get that BP and I was speechess when I finally got it...  No I damn near cried when I read this and I must say it almost sounds like you guys are trying to make people leave this game?  Why is this BP so unbalanced?  already has like a 20 sec cast time..  like that isn;t enough.  you'd think that before it came to live servers yo'd TEST it out on the TEST SERVER.  After all..  isn;t that what it is for???  May as well call if the "Pre-Nerf" server heh.<P>Third of all...  I started playing EQ in beta and there after cause I liked what it was and what you could do with it and I still like that fact that you can never solve it.  BUT....  You guys are pretty much driving me along with other people away from it and its like you couldn;t care less.  I've played this game well over 2 years as a cleric and I for one am getting sick the the BS you put classes/races and items through....  you Nerf Necro's...  Nerf Clerics...  Nerf effects..  Nerf Nerf Nerf..  when was the last time you did something good?  Ok maybe the 3 hour time limit on the naked corpse was good, but that was long overdue heh.<P>Honestly maybe you guys should listen to the resulst on those stupid little polls you put up before you pop into the server screen.  Either that or take some real polls and what really matters and get a clue what you guys are doing to yourselves......  You are going to ruin yourselves.  but hey.....  i'm just another Clerics that got bonked by the Nerf Stick that has been playing prolly more than anyone at Verant has  heh.  But its ok..  go hire another moron off the street that don;t know crap about the game and why don't you nerf rangers..  I heard their AC is too high.....  maybe if they could get over 900 AC they would be too valuable and could actually tank.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bunker mentality.  Wait it out, people will burn themselves out protesting in these designated threads, which will be for the most part ignored.  After a week or three, Verant will note a reduction in the amount of posts about it, and assume people have 'forgotten about it'.<P>This isn't true, of course - people don't forget these things.  It's the type of stuff that just gets stacked in that corner of your mind, until eventually, it builds up and you cancel your account.<P>This particular change was that last straw on the camel's back for quite a few people.  Well, more like a medium sized brick, but you get the point.  This change represents them saying, 'We do not want casters to get ANY more powerful at all with upper end items.  You have nothing to strive for, make your time, kkthx0r.'  This bp was NOT overpowering for just about any circumstance.  It made the cleric more powerful, but I assure you...it does NOT let us kill stuff we couldn't kill.  The absolute WORST it will do is make me occasionally log on the cleric on my second account to do buffs because our cleric is low on mana from fighting and we don't like downtime.<P>But you know what?  That makes the game less fun.  All of these cleric changes do, really.  I can only imagine what a pain it would be if the clerics I hunt with regularly ACTUALLY cared about dying (two are well into 60, one is a twink played on a second account/puter).  The higher end game is starting to die, and well, it's because shaman and druid heals just can't keep it alive.  And when it dies, paladins and necros will still be too gimped to res it. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Clerics are leaving this game in droves, because it is NOT FUN ANYMORE.  Removing an item that might be overpowered in some situations (we used the bp in exactly the same manner as the designer was worried about...and you know what?  This change will just piss us off, nothing more.) MAYBE at the expense of making the game that much less fun, well...makes me think you're putting your creations ahead of your customers.<P>Really, I HOPE you prove me wrong.  I'm not wrong all that often, but right now, a massive investment of my time is pleading that I am.<P>You have a LOT on the line with Tuesday's patch - and as addictive and fun as Tetris is, it won't save you by itself.<P>Gathu the Tactician, Xegony.<P>PS:  Here's a short and to the point list that will make this game be fun again at the higher levels.  Most every high level player would give you a similar list, and I'm sure you've seen some...but hey, maybe you haven't, and if that's the case:<P>1: Make every class useful in uber encounters, by enhancing the weak, not nerfing the strong.  They are currently useless, so if done carefully, they won't be overpowered.  Nerfing the strong makes you need to adjust mob strength, and that doesn't mean making stuff harder.<P>2: Make pure and priest classes actually GAIN effectiveness with gear.  Real effectiveness, along the lines of melee gear and weapons.  It gives people goals to strive for, and makes the game more fun.<P>3: Time sinks suck, as do totally impossible encounters.  See Sleeper's Tomb, most especially the non soul bond key issue (and the warders with velious hp and kunark aes...).<P>4: If you do a good job on 1-3, there is no 4.

</FONT><HR>P.S. I was Happy to help Lizwulf get her epic..  I've knows Liz little over a year now and I'd have to say she is one of the best clerics if not the best I've ever Met.  To see her treated like utter crap by you guys was very disturbing.  She'd plain give the BP off her back for anyone...  in fact she did 4 times..  she didn't roll on PoH BP's cause she refused cause others could use them.  Then he see Ragefire poof on her was bad enough..  but then to see you guys kick back and laugh about it was enough.<P>As to you Liz...  just lemme know what game you are going to..  I'll be there ;-P<P><BR>Deww Ji`e`toh<BR>59 Cleric that keeps on getting her arse beats cause agro and now can't even BP heal fer crap from Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To clerics, I think Absor stopped reading after page 4 of the last thread but anyway...<P>Absor, you stated that the opinions of players are usually THE consideration when deciding whether or not to implement a change and you stated that people would be happier with a "good" game. It seems however that a "good" game seems to be defined as something incomprehensible and only in the minds of Verant designers. We've asked to have some semblance of what the "Vision(TM)" is and it was stated that something like that would be impossible. A "good" game isn't one that makes the most money, a good game is something that satisfies it's players for a long period of time (an example would be Gemstone 3). To use the example of Simutronics' (TM) text based game Gemstone 3, they have not implemented any wide changes that hurt the players, and the game is in it's 12th year with an increased active player base. At the rate you seem to be going Everquest won't last after ShadowBane and Anarchy. <P>But if you aren't listening to customers/players and you are spending more time making excuses rather than making players happy, at least take the time to come up with a new excuse. The "It will totally ruin the game if we don't nerf j00" excuse has been used too many times (Donal's, Moss Covered Twig, these 2 BPs, Mage Sword of Runes, AE rains...etc).<P><BR>-Kelston Bernstar<BR>lv56 Magician of Tunare<BR>The Tribunal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm sure that the point of the "BP Change" should be taken by now.  What really saddens me is that this is what you get from tuning Clerics.   After all of the class balancing discussions we get four things.  <P>1) We get Fizzle rate (only) slighty reduced.<BR>2) Yaulp IV A Useless spell to clerics in the first place gets Nerfed!  LOL you actually reduce the atk given from it.<BR>3) We get our aggro from heals "Fixed" so we get killed more often.  Then fixed again so we get killed almost just as often.<BR>4) We get our best piece of armor nerfed.<P>After all the tuning this is the result?  You guys have the list.   Nothing else deserves to be implemented?  Are we that perfect a class?  I think not.  Please listen to your customers.  There is a call for help but you don't seem to hear it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064274-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064274-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064274-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064274-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064274-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064274-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064274&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064274&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
