</FONT><HR>Ok, to me there are 2 races that would make sence, Kerrans and Goblins.  Why?  Because they both have an ACTUAL city.  Kerran Ridge for the Kerrans and RunnyEye for the Goblins.<P>Ya, maybe they would have a LOT of problems getting places, but they would be more for the advanced player, not the beginner.  It would add more of a challenge.<P>Goblins<BR>Classes: Warrior, Wizard, Shaman<BR>Stats: low Intelligence, low Charisma, high dexterity<BR>Pros: Infravision, newbie zone inside city<P>Kerrans<BR>Classes: Monk, Shaman<BR>Stats: high agility, high charisma, low strength (not too low), low stamina<BR>Pros: Ultravision<BR>Cons: Can't wear plate (ring or chain being the highest) because of excessive heat from the fur.  Although this is a duh because of the classes I suggest.<P>I suggested these special classes because it's all I've seen these races have when fighting them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>About getting off of Odus.  Forget the Odus to Faydwer boat.  It's not needed.<P>Instead have a tunnel system under Erudin like that under Freeport and Qeynos.  The Kerrans could get out and the evil races could get in.  Several races benefit.  It should be fairly tricky to use but should be doable if you know your stuff.<P>If you suggest base Kerran stats over 100 I'd say you are going too far unless you want to also suggest about a 30% experience penalty or something.<P>If Kerrans are KoS everywhere then give them good stats.  If they get along with both good AND evils (except Erudites and maybe Iksar) then their stats can't be very good at all.  In short, the better their stats, the worse their faction.<P>I'd give them high agility (cats being agile), not particularly high wisdom and perhaps relatively average for other stats.<P>It might be best to not let them be monks.  The old time human monks are still trying to cope with Iksar monks.  Adding Kerran monks might send them into convulsions.<P>Making a playable race is a LOT of work.  Textures for everything they can possibly wear; a city with all the necessary guilds, merchants, and quests; models (they can't use a 3 year old low poly model anymore then the Iksar could use the old lizardman model, they'll need a new one); additional racial detail (male and female Kerrans should look different); LOTS of testing for balance and bugs; and probably additional recial details such as special weapons, histories, whatever.<P>I personally would be a little surprised if they introduced another playable race this late but you never know.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lejoin... The Warrens are a new dungeon on Odus for levels 2-20 (possibly up to 30).<P>EQMascot...  That bridge architect is part of a quest (that involves killing him and the others involved in building said bridge... the Erudites don't like it).<P>Cordaru...  A few things...<BR>1) Tunnel/sewer system under Erudin = great idea!  Only problem is, how to get up on that stupid boat platform thing.  The Erudin dock is too short and there's really only one way up from the water.<BR>2) Let me re-iterate my ideas for the starting stats for Kerrans "Str: 70 Sta: 75 Agl: 85 Dex: 90 Wis: 75 Int: 70 Cha: 65"  See my first post on page 1 for more details.<BR>3) The Monk Best of the Best tourney, and a /who all monk 40 60, will show that Human Monks are still prefered and better.  There are so many Iksar Monks because people wanted something different.<BR>4) It may not be quite as much work as you think.<BR>4a) Textures for clothing/Armour = yes, a bit complex.<BR>4b) A city with all the necessary guilds, merchants, and quests = first two already exist with only minor add-ins, third is something people want more of anyway.<BR>4c) models (they can't use a 3 year old low poly model anymore then the Iksar could use the old lizardman model, they'll need a new one) = people like the look of Kerrans now!  Not much improvement needed.<BR>4d) additional racial detail (male and female Kerrans should look different) = how much different do Iksar male and females look?  How much different do tiger male and females look?  Goes back to the models.  BTW, I can tell the difference between male and female Kerran NPCs as they are now.<BR>4e) LOTS of testing for balance and bugs = racial balance is easy, bugs can be a problem. (so have them on Test first!  Sheesh, that's what it's for, right?)<BR>4f) and probably additional recial details such as special weapons, histories, whatever. = racial weapons are unneeded, histories are already there, the rest is covered by Quests.<P>P.S. Attention to detail is my specialty.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes. Would really make sense. <P>Personally I look for a Good vs Evil Server and if the cats are added to the evil team they would have access to bards, rangers, (maybe druids). Only downside could be that it would probably mean much pvp between erudites and kerrans.

</FONT><HR>This is a wonderful idea. I think I remember reading something that the Kerrans were going to be a playable race in the beginning, but the idea got scrapped midway (much like Lycanthropy, sadly.)

</FONT><HR>I TOTALLY agree with this!  This is a wonderful idea that would revamp the areas really only used by erudites(mostly newbies who dont stay long anyways) and high levels (the hole.)  I think, however, that the classes of Kerrans should be this<BR>Rogue, Shaman, Cleric, Monk.<BR>I think this balances things in a few ways- first of all, there is only one good shaman right now (barbarians), if you play on a PvP teams server, you know this is a big disadvantage.  The second thing is that NO race in the game can be shamans AND clerics, humans can be clerics and druids, so why is this impossible?  Thirdly, we need more monks in the world that arent the same size.  I'm sick of seeing medium sized monks (personally I want halfling monks, but thats out of the question.)  Cats are fairly wise, but not smart.  Just ask my cat =P.  They seem like a mystic culture, kinda like shamans and clerics both are.  I really dont see druids as mystics.  Finally, Cats are very stealthy, and the monk and rogues fit this description.  Monks make sense, because cats fight with natural weapons, not with weapons.  So for monks I would suggest making their fists more powerful than humans.  Possibly instead of the 14/26 humans get, maybe 15/24.  I also think that unlike human and iksar fists which start gaining power at 5(is this right?) and getting faster about level 30(not sure of this) I think they should start getting faster to start with.  So the chart would go something like this<BR>Human: Iksar:  Kerrans:<BR>Level (damage/delay) <BR>1 (4/36) 1 (4/36)  1 (4/36)<BR>5 (5/36) 5 (5/36)  5 (5/35)<BR>10 (6/36) 10 (6/36)  10 (6/35)<BR>15 (7/36) 15 (7/36)  15 (7/34)<BR>20 (8/36) 20 (8/36)  20 (8/34)<BR>25 (9/35) 25 (9/36)  25 (9/33)<BR>30 (10/34) 30 (10/36)  30 (10/32)<BR>35 (11/33) 35 (11/35)  35 (11/31)<BR>40 (12/32) 40 (12/34)  40 (12/30)<BR>45 (13/31) 45 (13/33)  45 (13/29)<BR>50 (14/30) 50 (14/32)  50 (14/28)<BR>60 (14/26) 60 (14/28)  60 (15/24)<BR>This doesn't seem to be a balance issue, since I can think of many weapons at the appropriate levels that out damage fists.  I personally, think that unless monks have an epic weapon, fists get far too little use.  <BR>Now for rogues.  Cats are sneaky, and rogueish to me at least (my cat likes sneaking up and biting my foot.)  But, I think that since they have claws, Kerrans should have the racial ability to backstab with fists.  Does this seem like a gameplay issue? I dont know of many rogues that use fists anyways, so why would this be a problem?<BR>Also, for PvP purposes, I think kerrans should be considered a short race.  First of all, kerrans arent as tall as a human.  Secondly, short races need a shaman.  Evils and humans get them, why not stumps?  Thirdly, The fact that shorts only have 3 races which have limited class abilities.  I.E. Many clerics, many druids, not enough diversity.  The only problem i see with this is the thing about gnomes getting posotive faction when you kill kities(I still am puzzled by this, no quests to date involve gnome vs. kitty relations.)  The final thing which I want to point out, is that chain mail should be appropriate.  Not sure about plate, seems restrictive (even though I have, in real life, seen a man dance and do cartwheels with relative ease in full platemail.)  but might still work. Stats should be:<BR>STR 75<BR>STA 70<BR>AGI 95<BR>DEX 100<BR>WIS 80<BR>INT 70<BR>CHA 75<BR>(Not sure how this averages out, but I compared them to every other race in norrath to decide it, basically cats are more charming than halflings and ogres, but less so than elves and stronger than elves, but weaker than barbarians or trolls.) All I really have to say, to sum it up, is there needs to be AT LEAST ONE blue name on this thread, even if it's abashi saying that this idea will never happen.  <BR>Oh well, my thoughts.

</FONT><HR>Alright... for those who keep saying it...<P>Why Rangers OR Rogues?  (Instead of Rangers AND Rogues?)<P>Why Clerics AND Shamen?  (If you read the class description of Shamen, this would be redundant.)<P>If you give them a plate-wearing class (Clerics/Warriors) and don't let them wear plate, you need to give them a natural AC boost.  If you limit them to non-plate-wearing classes (Shaman/Ranger) then the AC boost is not required.<P>I also believe Kerrans should have a naturally high Dexterity as well as Agility.  This gives them a niche that no other race has.<P>As for the PvP issues...  In racewar, side them with the Elves. (This makes the boat idea mentioned earlier in the thread that much more ideal and senseable.)  And in light vs. dark, they would be a light race.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll leave all the statistical and informational posts to others who know better than I.  All I want is some official response saying, "Hey!  This is a nifty idea.  Let's do this" or "Hey!  This idea has merits, but alas it is not part of the Vision."<P>Just a comment from Verant is all I want.

</FONT><HR>Humans can have Clerics and Druids.  The reason I suggest both Cleric and Shaman is that Kerrans display both classes in their town at present.  MANY races have both, Goblins, Frogloks, Burynai.  It would put an interesting spin on the race.<P>Not that Verant will ever do it, they had a golden opportunity and created a totally new, not very interesting and totally unforseen race for Kunark.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
