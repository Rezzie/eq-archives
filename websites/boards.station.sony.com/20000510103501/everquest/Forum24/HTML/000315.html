People complain about how there's no role-playing on the server and then when someone DOES kill them because he's playing like a real role-player would, they get pissed-off!  What's wrong with killing someone because they're not your race?  People do it to DElves all the time, so why not Dwarves?  He's role-playing the game to the best of his ability, so why don't you people give it a try?<P>Just my two CP</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Nothing is wrong with what you did Balliador.  The main reason people moan and complain about being killed is the looting system...<P>More then likely they were scared you will take something cool...  Hell I kind of admire you for what you do as a warrior.  I am a Dark Elven warrior...  and yes I do have some valueble equipement on... due to the rariety of some of the items... I hate getting into PvP Battle.  I love PvP Battle but in order for me to work at 100% in every battle I need alot of my armor.<P>Yes I know this is lame... but in this game it is true... The non caster classes are equipement needed.  Without equipement they suck... If the game was skill based it would be a differant story.<P>So until Verant decides to do something about our looting system people will get pissed... I ignore them normally.  So grin and bare it...

</FONT><HR>People are mad at you because you are a complete asshole spoiling other people's enjoyment of the game. Just because the server lets you PK doesn't mean you should do it!  If you do, then you must expect people to get mad at you. If you are walking down Madison Av. in RL and some guy comes up to you and tells you to leave or he will kill you, you wouldn't like it. But in RL he could kill you - it doesn't make it right.<BR> Reasonable (read grown-ups since, forgive me if i am wrong, you obviously require your parents to sign up for you) people don't play on Rallos to PK, but instead for the increased feeling of realism and community (in a Bungle-esque sense) that it procures.<BR> Besides, why should you get upset when someone shouts that you are a PKer? You are!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

NOT just pvp, because that can already be done via duels. The ONLY difference is un-consented player killing - ie PK.<P>Question2:- What promotes a "greater sense of realism" over the non-PK servers? <BR>Answer2: PK of course - otherwise why be here at all? If no-one pked here it would be EXACTLY the same as on the blue servers - you are complaining about the exact thing that brought you here...<P>As for a greater sense of community (your other point), you get this because danger brings people together, and RZ has the danger you obviously crave.<P>Now I agree that the people who play a naked mage and just randomly run around attacking players on low health are also being assholes, but to insult the person posting who has made NO insult to others, and who tries to RP the event, and is NOT a naked mage, and even offers their victim a chance to leave - well how else can they possibly engage in pvp except a duel? <P>As for saying that if someone came up in the street and attacked you you'd be pissed - yes, but this is a game and you don't play a game to be doing RL things - that's what RL is for :P<P>Besides, the Zetetic Elench were noted for their avid, non-judgemental acceptance of other societies and attitudes...maybe you should re-think your station name?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I agree with your points to a certain extent. The only difference between the "carebear" servers and Rallos is the nonconcensual PKing. I also have no objection to true RP PKing. I would actually prefer a server where PKing had more consequences, with a distinction made between attacking a player and defending oneself, and maybe prices on the heads of PKers. <BR> However, it is NOT roleplaying to tell someone to leave your sight or you will kill them (unless you are roleplaying a sociopath). RP PK might be for example, a druid who attacks necromancers because of their perversion of Tunare, or revenge for a previous attack (recall the UO "lightening war").<BR> Also, Balliador himself admits that he is a PKer (and I would say it is clear from his message that he is a sociopath too). His complaint is that people are upset that he kills them. This is just silly. Of course people will get upset - player death has consequences (corpse reclaimation, lost items etc). <BR> The sociopathic PKing is actually noticably worse at lower levels, presumably because a certain element like a quick fix of newbie killing but have no real desire to play on Rallos long term. I don't know why Verant didn't make everyone non-pk until level 5 say to remove this problem.<BR> I also admit that Rallos needs a certain number of sociopathic PKers to make it as community driven as it is. Without the danger, bonds are not so tightly formed, and it is the collective hatred for these sociopaths which brings us closer. (Indeed there is a mirroring of this in real life, as Huxley pointed out with Savage's "right to suffer". I am also reminded of Judas Iscariot who has been hated for playing a fundamentaly important role.) However, it is Balliador who has chosen his role in Rallos society. No-one makes him do it. He should not complain that we do not like him.<P> One final point, and forgive me if I am wrong (I read the book a long time ago), but did the Zetetic Elench not break away from The Culture exactly because they felt the need of a society to make value judgements?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm - there's a question here. I had assumed from the post that Balliador was telling people to leave the dwarven areas, and so was roleplaying a dwarf angered at intrusion. Of course, if he's going to commons to do this his rp motives are a little light  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>On a second point: I missed replying to this, but yes, Balliador, you must expect people to dislike or even hate you when you kill them - after all, they were doing something else and you stopped them doing it and possibly took asn item or money from them.  It is a shame that there isn't more penalty for dying, because then the pk would really be risking something, and you might find that your rp needed to be more in depth to stop the general population from reducing your character to lvl 1 / no skill points...<P>P.S. Zetetic Elench did leave the culture, but because they thought the culture imposed too much of their own mores on the new societies they met - their boast was that you never met the same person twice - even if it was the same person (if you see what I mean hehe). Didn't impress the excession though...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Boy, Elench, have you got a problem!  Now, usually I'd refrain from insulting on posts, but since you took the liberty of turning an honest, inquisitive post into something else, I'm not going to stick to my usual rules.<P>  First, let me give you a little information on Role-Playing(expanded on trulybaffeld's first paragraph).  Role-Playing is playing your character or race as you think they would have acted or you would have acted in that situation (e.g. instead of saying "this server sucks", you say "the land in which I live is stricken with countless ailments.").  Balliador, wanting to make the most of his role-playing, has chosen to hate other races that come into Dwarven territory or camps.  You, like the moron you are, have decided that this is bad and he is a jerk for playing his Dwarf how he thinks a Dwarf would act.  If you don't want to be killed, go to a blue server.  Now, maybe you're one of the people he's attacked or maybe you're on a blue server and just decided to post here because you think it's fun to flame people.  But, if you think he's not role-playing (you said you wouldn't mind if there was more of it), just what is your definition of it?  In fact, he's like a guard that isn't affected by faction.  If you can live with them, you can live with Bally.  Overall, you have a HUGE mental impairment if you don't think Balliador is role-playing.<P><BR>I think we need more people like Balliador on the server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I applaud your character, and hope I can meet him someday myself. (unfortunately, it would be at the end of a blade...I play a dark elf and now Iksar.)  But, I would look forward to gladly fight you as you valiantly defend your land!<P>To anyone who doesn't think we are roleplaying: (elench...this is for you.  In case you are to dense to realize that.)  Please leave this server.  And if you encounter anybody who is role-playing on the Blue-Servers, please send them to Rallos.
