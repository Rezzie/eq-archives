</FONT><HR>I have loved this game a very long time and I have taken cleric nerfs very well in the past when they were explained to be in the best interest of the game.<P>I watched you nerf MoK, Celestial Healing (worked to good on necros I guess), Celestial Elixar, Donal's BP once.. then again.<P>I watched you give versions of our Celestial heal and Remedy to Druids and Shammies.<P>I watched you give us more agro and then tell us we havent tried it long enough to have an opinion and that we should learn from wizzies.  (I have a level 52 wizzy named Elsie, and I know enough to have an opinion, by the way.)<P>But I am confused and saddened by your latest decision to nerf clerics.  Its a heal over time... It takes 20 seconds to cast.  I am boggled by this one.  <P>I have recently passed my Donal's BP down to a younger guildy when I got PoG.  Now Donal's is going to be a better BP, in stats and effect. =(<P>I feel like I am being made a fool of.<P>EQ is a game I play for fun.

</FONT><HR>Ok, this is the last straw.  I'm calling to see Absor removed from his post as liasion to the Verant customer base.<P>1)  This BP nerf is just utter bull.  It's so illogical, I'm having trouble finding the words to politely explain why.  After MUCH soulsearching, I've decided there is only one good thing about this nerf.  Cobalt gauntlets no longer have the most useless effect (Reckless Strength) on a class armor piece.<P>2)  Absor has continually shown HUGE bias against both the warrior and the cleric classes.  His opinion going into the talks was that both classes were overpowered, and bias has blinded him into continual nerfing of the clerics, and completely ignoring the warriors (except for the nerfs).  Meanwhile, he hands out upgrades to the other classes like a politician kisses babies. <P>3)  Since the talk threads started, NO class has been hurt more than the clerics.  And there have been no changes more controversial than the changes made to the cleric class.  Why is this?  Because Absor, for some reason has some bias against the clerics.<P>4) Since the 'talk' threads have started, Absor has posted merely three times (count them, THREE!) on the warrior talk threads. There has been no 'discussion', no 'talk', no repsonse to our valid concerns.  In six weeks we have absolutley no dialogue, and then we get nerfed.<P>I think it is glaringly obvious that Absor has some issues he needs to deal with that keep him from holding his post in a non-biased manner, and should be replaced with someone that truly cares about the game AND its players, not just his own personal whims and opinions.<P>I've played this game since Day 1.  And I have NEVER had thoughts of leaving until these past few weeks.  I'd guess that if one of the upcoming games were on the shelf, I'd be gone now.<P><BR>Coffinn Unforgiven<BR>lvl 60 Dark Elf Warrior of The Tribunal<P>Bombastic P.

</FONT><HR>No, okay, I really wanna know your reasoning behind this.  You have high level players working for you.  They must know you're gonna seriously piss off the player base.  You much know you're gonna seriously piss off the player base.  You, Alan, are just the guy they force to tell us these things, and you're trained to cheerily respond (or try to be professional as possible), knowing full well it's a suicide move.<P>You guys do things to merely annoy the player base now.  You're changing this game around and almost all of the changes suck, especially at higher levels.<P>my question:  What is the reasoning or logic behind it?  What do you hope to gain?  You realize that if you have a happy customer they stay longer, right?  then why do you waste days of play time/work by nerfing things after they've been in the game far too long to be nerfed without a reaction?<P>I'm truly not trying to flame at all.  I really would like an answer.  There has to be some psychological or business oriented answer for the stuff that's been goin on.  Otherwise you are trying to get rid of us because you believe we're nearing the end of the road and you don't wanna keep this going.  Please give me one good reason to do this (it's not overpowering...trust me.

</FONT><HR>Ohhh no..  Everyone at Verant has lost their minds, they dont know what they are doing to the game.<P>When they came out with the talk threads I thought it was about improving EQ.  Instead they are just trying to find each classes strengths so they can nerf them away.  Clerics are the first to get hit hard but just wait...  I'm sure they will get around to making the other classes useless.  Verant seems to hate how the players can actually kill a boss monster, are we not meant to form large raids?  If not there are many dungeons that might as well be removed from the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll try to be polite here, though if I'd see a verant staffer in real life I'd probably yell very loudly, which isn't a polite thing for a 54 vicar to do.<P>I'm not sure what you are thinking Verant, but what I assume is that you have decided to start balancing the game so the Uberguilds can't kill your Ubermobs.  I'm not in an Uberguild and have never killed an Ubermob, but these changes have effected me.  Let me try to explain this to you, I don't have a donal's BP, I don't have a POG cleric BP, but these Uberguilds, that you seem to hate, have made me want one.  One of the fun things about this game is the desire to accumulate things.  When FoH post about something cool in VP or Sleepers tomb it make me want to keep playing to keep striving for these things.  I'd love to have the time they do to play but I play enough that these dreams could come true.  <P>Unfortunately, You have decided that for the "best interest of the game" you need to drastically change the rules in the middle of the game.  Leaving those of us behind the curve a little just shaking our heads wondering why we can't have the same fun and cool items that others got to have.<P>It seems clear that you don't like your Ubermobs to be killed, but having the dream of possibly killing them is what keeps a lot of us playing.<P>I'm not sure if you play the game any more, I know you say you do but these recent changes do not make it look that way.<P>Please but away the nerf stick and fix some real issues instead of ones you perceive. Here are few examples.<P>1. Pathing - Quit saying you are working on it, Do it.<BR>2. LD - Why when a character goes LD it keeps fighting but I can't heal it.  I know you say o he becomes a NPC.  Change this, quit nerfing things and make a different way for LD characters to behave.  You can do this but it seem you have the wrong priorities to try.<BR>3. Work on customer service, teach Absor that I don't know is not the right answer to a question for 11 out 31 questions(from castersrealm). If he doesn't know he should at least know who to ask then he can post a reply. Quit this witch-hunt for bad character names.  You let most of them be around for a year plus without any harm, don't change them now.<BR>4. Try to remember that this game is supposed to be fun and continuously changing the rules makes it very unfun.<P>Thank for reading this,<P>Ozzn<BR>54 Vicar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You realize that this heals 1500hp's in 44 seconds, where donals ch'ed every 30 seconds before? (and I think your change to that bp was a bad decision too).  These two are not even in the same class.

</FONT><HR>Not sure what to say. I play a lvl 60 druid and a lvl 60 warrior. Dont even have a cleric. But for the life of me, I cant understand why you would attack the class like this. One thing is obvious though. It appears you do not want your higher level monsters killed easily. Ok, I can understand that. That explains the Donals BP nerf. Then you go and make CH a death sentence for the cleric. And nerf warrior taunt at same time. This I cant even begin to understand. Then, to top it all off, you go and nerf some BP from PoG. Not just a nerf, but you basically make the effect useless. This seems more like poking a stick in the clerics eye then a game balance issue, but I am not sure since I dont know anyone with a PoG BP.<P>This leads me to 2 possible conclusions. A) You are just sadistic and think people will adjust because they are *addicted* to the game, and therefore cant quit. Or b) You simply have no clue about what people consider fun in this game.<P>Listen Verent: Once you have reached a high level, you want to be able to go after the big game. EQ is all about progression. If I wanted to go back and solo crushbone, I could clean the place out in 3 minutes. Now, I have never taken down King Tormax, or even the Dain. But we are ready to.
