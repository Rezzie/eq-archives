Why didnt you lower it a little at a time instead of one big jump just as you reduced the effectiveness of the donal's bp.

</FONT><HR>I think this change might be better accepted IF:<BR>1) The velious mobs were tuned down to acceptable levels.  Verant admitted some mobs were made with the Donal's BP in mind, and they've only said they're "looking at" them, when it should be blatantly obvious that if you make something with a tactic in mind, break the tactic, you must change the mob.<P>2) You put a desirable cleric-oriented effect on the new breastplate, then give clerics the option of exchanging their broken breastplates for new ones.  You admit it was a mistake; why penalize us?<P>3) You give us a reasonable explanation as to why this is a broken item, as it does not allow for the exploitation of upper Velious mobs that the Donal's BP did, which was your previous justification for the previous nerfing.<P>4) You give clerics some hope.  We're just tired, Verant.  Tired and depressed.<P>Just so you understand where Clerics are coming from, we play this game to increase in power.  That's quite obviously the goal. Gain experience, gain items, gain spells, etc.  When you do things like this, despite the fact that it (arguably) improves the overall game, we feel like we're losing ground and we're fighting a battle we're not allowed to win.  We feel like we make no progress, accomplish nothing, gain nothing.  And any gains we make are subject to the future whims of quirky Gods of balancing we have no control over.<P>Please realize that we play the game to feel a sense of progress and accomplishment, and when you make changes like this, you undermine everything your great game has created.  I play this for entertainment, not so you can make us feel ... impotent.<P>Please, think these decisions through.  This is for balancing.  Balance, by it's very nature, must have two sides.  If the BP is broken, help us out in other ways.  Mark of Karn is still broken (doesn't heal enough to make it worthwhile), Aegolism still is a poor spell, druids still get a spell better than the best of our hero line, our heal spells still can't keep up with the damage of Velious mobs.  BALANCE, don't break.<P>Finnien</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am increasingly disappointed.  That is all.  I have really enjoyed playing the game.  REally enjoyed being a cleric.  I am not ready to quit yet.  But you know, I get a bit closer every day.<P>I am not sure I would post in teh same tone as some of the other posts, or use the same language, but by the same token, I don't disagree with very many of them either.<P>I played UO until I grew tired of the way the CS interacted with their players.  I, like many, many others switched over to EQ.  I made a decision a long time ago never to purchase another OSI product.  I haven't.  I won't.  Some of the things that have been occurring in EQ have caused me to begin to contemplate quitting in the near future, and they have also begun to cause me to start thinking "do I want to buy products from this company ever again."  I did not think I would think that about Sony or Verant.  Nevertheless, I do now.<P>What I don't understand is this:  You have an extremely successful and profitable game.  Why do you keep tinkering with it?  I don't think what you are doing is accomplishing your goals.  <P>I am sorry Abashi, I have been reading posts from you for a long time.  I frequently thought you maintained a sense of humor in an extremely difficult situation.  Your recent post that if clerics didn't like healing aggro, you were sure that druids and shamans would be happy to take over the healing seemed quite frankly mean spirited.<P>None of the ones that I know want to.  They no more want to get killed after casting one heal then I do.<P>This is *not* the time to admit that you were wrong about heal-aggro.  The time for that should have been when it was tested.  Which it was not.  This is also not the time to nerf PoG bp's.  What about all those folks who ruined faction on an entire continent to get them?  Why are you making changes so long *after* people have invested time and enthusiasm and energy into it?  <P>And btw, while we are on the subject, please make Celestial Heal drop more often, or better yet, sold by vendors.  It was promised as a Velious Spell.  It really isn't in the game.  At least as a practical matter.  When 59th level clerics offer 5kpp for a 44 spell *and can't get anyone to sell it to them*, then as a practical matter, it is not in the game.<P>Tarf<BR>47 Cleric <BR>Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Item recast delays were tried before.  They failed, because players could simply drop the item on the ground and pick it back up again.  Items in everquest are simply a number.  There is no extra space for recording when the last time it was used.<P>However, no drop items solve the dropping problem.  This brings up problem two: logging out will reset the item.  This happens because there is no space in the character record for the item recast data, it can only be held in memory, so when a player camps, that data is lost.<P>For a short recast item, this works fine, i.e. the BP could have a 1 minute recast delay, because it takes that long to camp and log back in.  However, for it to be well balanced it would need a longer delay.<P>So, here's the way to do recast delays, without any painful character record expansion:<P>When a recast item is used, change the item to another equivalent item, similar to the way charges are handled.  Have the memory only data keep track of how long that item has been there.  When it's been there 3 minutes (or whatever the recast is), change the item back to the original item, at which point it can be used again.<P>If a player camps, the timer is reset, meaning the player may camp at 2.5 minutes, then have another 3 minutes to wait when they log in, but that's better than being able to exploit the item by camping after each use.  The flaw in the system then hurts the player, instead of helping him, so there is no incentive for the player to exploit this bug.<P>For items that have a very long recast, there could be several versions of it.  For example, for an item with a 60 minute recast, use version 1 and it changes to version 10.  Every 6 minutes it changes to the previous version, version 9, then version 8, then version 7, down to eventually version 1, when it can be used again.  This way if someone goes LD at the 59 minute mark, they lose only the last 5 minutes, and not 59.<P>--Thott<BR>Guildleader<BR>&lt;Afterlife&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Items that were impossible to balance? <P>Yeah, we've pretty much agreed all the way around that high HP heal items are a bad idea.  These items were in fact created by a guy who plays a high-50s cleric in an "uberguild" and even he didn't realise the impact.  <P>In any case, while I personally agree that 1 minute more or less makes the effect useless, these items are such that there's not really a middle ground.  Usually somewhere between "Overpowered" and "Useless" there's "Balanced".  I don't think there is in this case given our current limitations.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why not make the recast time to 3 minutes but leave the cast time alone? <P>That might be a good option, but unfortunately we can't put recast times on items.  It's one of the things that we want to do at some point, but it's not a small undertaking.  There's so many things that have to be taken into account to enable recast times.  To liken it to spells, having to wait the full recast time when memorizing a spell is one such feature that was necessary in order to get them working there.  Getting them working right on items would require much the same type of constraints.  We have to account for what happens if you remove the item then put it back on.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Please call Absor, wake his ass up, and ask him to respond to this thread. <P>He's usually playing EQ about now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  In any case, in all fairness he wasn't involved with the decision up until the tail end, where his concern became just getting the word out rather than by everyone getting 'surprised' when they heard the reports from Test over the weekend.  <P>Anyway, I'm not going to try defending the items or the fact that they were put in game in the first place.  They were a bad idea.  It unfortunately didn't become appparent just how bad until a significant number of people had them.  As for just stopping the drops, versus swaping and nerfing the old ones, we didn't want a situation to arise that would make the clerics without those BPs "useless" as sometimes happens.  Given the outcry over the announcement, and the fact that people are saying that clerics are useless because of the change to these items, I think our worry was a fair one.<P>Anyway, as far as the healing hate stuff on Test goes, here's what's going in:<P>1. The healing-hate cap is being reduced. (less hate max per spell)<BR>2. The calculation of hate is moving a ratio of less than 1:1.  In other words, currently if you heal 1000 (assuming the target is over 51), you gain 1000 hate.  After the change you'll gain less than 1000 hate.<BR>3. We're fixing a problem with the temporary hate from sitting.  Sitting was causing an extraordinary amount of hate making it nigh on impossible to med when in combat.<BR>4.  Heal spells assign hate on what we call an "assisted" basis.  In other words, any NPC that sees you cast a beneficial spell on their enemy (someone on their hate list) will add hate since they saw you doing that.  They do this whether or not they are the primary target.  This is why in multiple-attacker scenarios *everything* jumps the cleric as soon as he heals.  This is also why everything that's mezed jumps the cleric as soon as mez breaks.  We're fixing it so that critters that are mezed or stunned only add enough hate to prevent exploits of mez and stun, rather than the full load they do now when they see you cast a beneficial spell on their enemy.<BR>5.  Along the same lines, we're fixing that problem whereby hate lists would propagate across zones.  Everyone has been sitting in the dread lands between combat when something ran from half way across the zone to slap your cleric, right?  Basically the same thing.<P>That's basically it for what's on test at the moment.<P>-Gordon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gordon,<BR>While I'm interested in the healing/hate changes on test, any improvement will not make me any happier about any of the other crud that has been thrown on clerics lately.  Why?  Well the heal taunting fiasco was something your company created intentionally.  Putting it back to where it was only means that change was null. Fixing your own problem doesn't get you any votes. <P>Nerfing the spells/bps, failing to allow clerics to have any fun at all and giving most of our 'defining' abilities to several much easier to play, versatile, soloable classes will still be just as bad.  For all we know the healing aggro change was put in because you wanted to nerf clerics and that by combining the nerfing with 'fixing' the aggro back to reasonable levels you hope we will forgive you the nerfs.<P>Having fun means having some versatility or whatever you are becomes boring.  As clerics go up in level they lose all of their tiny versatility.  Nuke? nope not allowed, monsters all too MR and its way more efficient to heal tanks.  Stun? nope mobs are marked as unstunnable and if you do try it you get wiped out by the aggro.  Solo? no way.  Our high level DDs are a fraction better than lower ones but mobs hp goes up exponentially.<P>Its all takeaway where clerics are concerned.  Nothing fun added, all changes made to make clerics worse at their one remaining battle skill, healing.  You have had lots of time to make the game fun post 50 but no one at Verant seems to have player fun as a goal, its all 'lets make sure we challenge uber guild X'.  Let me clue you in, the folks in uber guild X are the ones who will leave EQ as soon as another viable online game pops up.  They are the die-hard gamers who want to jump on a new game and master it.  You will lose them no matter what you do.<P>All you are doing with all these nerfs is losing the casual gamer types (90% of the population?) who would otherwise have stuck around EQ a long time since they still have lots to explore and enjoy chatting with friends.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

At the level of gameplay that you have to be to get these BP's, all the BP does for you is cut some downtime a little bit and help you twink.<P>If you have made it so far and so high that you can get one of those bp's then that should be a perk you deserve.<P>All you have done today is show us all yet again that you dont spend ANY serious amount of time testing or even thinking about stuff before you do it, then when you realize you messed up again, you stick is right up our 2hole instead of sucking up your mistake and bearing the results yourselves.<P>You might possibly be one of the most arrogant and reckless game companies ive ever seen in action.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You realize people have handed down their Donal's upon looting a PoG BP (or busted their rear to complete the quest.  OMG Dol, I'm feel so bad for the work you put in!) <P>You realize you are leaving us (in your own words) a useless item for our effort?<P>You realize this was a 1500 point heal over a long period of time and only saved us on "downtime" as you said it was designed?<P>You realize you are changing the heal/hate back to the way it worked in effect to before you changed it? <P>You realize you have given versions of our heal spells to Druids and Shammies?<P>You realize you gave a Pally the ability to rez?<P>So where is a cleric suppose to shine now?  Shall I revel in my ability to cast complete heal?  My level 39 spell is my identity?<P>~Log me in for rezzes if the pallies are busy.

</FONT><HR>While the un-nerf is appreciated, where is the upgrade to our weak points that the other classes are receiving?  We got nothing but nerfs, un-nerfs, fixes, and an upgrade to remedy that didn't need it.  Un-nerf is throwing us a bone?  Give us self invis already, that's a small bone that unbalances nothing, but clerics would thank you for a change.  I would be able to run through Wakening Lands without getting chased by 3 panthers and casted on by 2 Holgresh wanderers, which ultimately means nothing to me, but it sure annoys those who are sitting at SkyShrine or Kael trying to meditate up.  To get such small things out of you guys is like pulling teeth.  Druids and shaman whine, they get a sweet upgrade.  Paladins and Rangers whine, and as well they get upgraded (not that these classes didn't need it).  Clerics whine, we get nerfed.  Where's our love?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063795&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063795&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
