</FONT><HR>Just read the new patch message.  Very impressive listening skills VI.  We warriors ask for an improvement to taunt, and what happens?  You make it tougher for us to taunt mobs off of our group members.  Up until this point I believed in you guys in doing what was right, but now, yeesh, I don't know what to think.  All I can hope is that our taunt is made better to make up for this step back.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>We can taunt, but it takes us a lot more time than it would to an hybrid. So basically, we have to rely on hybrids to do our own job (taunting the mob and bringing to us), as if we weren't dependent enough on EVERYBODY in this game.<P>Now that hybrids will come very close to us at tanking, warriors won't be necessary anymore, and that means a lot of us sitting on our butts because groups will prefer to take the sk that can reach them on his own rather than having to go get the warrior at the other end of the zone.<P>Maybe you're not on an overcrowded server, but with 2500+ players, i spend HOURS shouting for a group. And i can't do anything else, because i am unable to solo greens for fun without a huge downtime.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor wrote:<P>&gt;Ah, yes. But how about looking at it the other &gt;way. After all, once I deal with the soft and &gt;mushy wizard I can get down to dealing with that &gt;annoying thorn in my side. Because the caster is &gt;easier to get rid of, get rid of him first.<P>&gt;Isn’t that what players do?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bzzzt. Wrong. You lose both the 3 piece bedroom set and the washer/dryer combo. The most often used tactic when dealing with a warrior type mob and a caster type mob is to mez the caster type mob and ToT it while everyone kills the warrior type mob. Same with nameds, etc. The more powerful the creature (in terms of HP, melee damage, etc.), the sooner you want to take it down. Leave it until last and it's a group wipeout waiting to happen. You ALWAYS get rid of the mob that will last the longest first.<P>As far as Warriors go, there's a few things that I don't understand that I would like some clarification on please. Mind you I am not complaining, I would just like to know the reasoning behind these things.<P>-From Day 1, it was said that since hybrids get the benefit of both melee and spells, they would not be the best at either. Monks are the best melee damage dealers. That's logical since they don't spend their time learning spells. Rogues are up there too. In my mind Warriors should be head and shoulders better than Rangers/SKs/Paladins. I personally think you are ruining the term "Warrior". I would have recommended making a class called "Meat Shield" instead. Your interpretation of a Warrior goes against everything a Warrior is. <P>-From Day 1, it was said Warriors would be the best line of defense and would undoubtedly be able to out-tank any other class. This is due to their ability to wear PLATEMAIL class armor and their experience at doing nothing other than taking a beating and dishing it out. Why then is there hybrid armor of CHAINMAIL classes comparable to Warrior armor? Sure Cobalt and the higher Velious armor has no peer for AC, but that's inaccessible by 75% of the people in the game. It also looks silly when I see Druids the supposed nature people walking around in Chainmal or platemail looking armor. That's just silly. Rogues in platemail? Give me a break. Remember, I am basing this off of what was spoken by VERANT from Day 1. Everything they said at release went down the tubes the second the Planes opened and Kunark came out.<P>AS for improvements, here's an idea:<P>-It is pretty damn silly to see a level 55 Barbarian with a sword bigger than the elf standing next to him to Critical Hit for 43 damage. I cannot put into words how utterly stupid that is. My idea for Warriors (being as they are the "Masters of All Weapons and Armed Combat") is to give them base damage equal to the damage rating on the weapon. For instance a Lamentation has a 9 damage rating. Simply make it so the Warrior can do NO LESS than 9 damage with this weapon. He can still miss, the damage cap on that weapon is still the same, critical hits would obviously be effected, but not to the degree as to make critical hits insanely powerful (every one hitting above the weapons max damage cap), but they would be slightly increased as to reflect the minimum cap on the damage of the weapon.<P>-Mana is a casters lifeblood. Hit Points is a Warriors. Monks have Mend Wound which helps alot. Warriors have nothing. I would like to see some type of "Meditation" skill for Warriors to regain hit points. Doesn't it make sense? Or perhaps a Mend skill for Warriors. It's only fair isn't it? I mean we can't cast a spell, we can't mend, we're NOT the best at melee. Basically you have taken away the very description of our class as it was described by VERANT and given us the role of MEAT SHIELD. The VERY LEAST you could do is give us the ability to regen our hit points at an accelerated rate, no? <P>-Gaidal <BR>56 Barbarian Myrmidon<BR>&lt;Clan of Shadows&gt;<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm...Verant<P>I see that most of the other classes have had added improvements given to them.  Some of their items have been nerfed.<P>I am a Warlord on Povar and I will fill you in on a couple of tidbits since apparently there are holes in what-you-would-call improvements to taunt and other items in your patch.<P>Taunt:  You are taking warrior usable weapons from the epic to other weapons like rod of lamentation, truncheon of doom etc..and reducing their taunt ability when they process?<P>Why is that?<BR>Number 1:  These weapons are hard to come by as it is on any server since you nerfed the amount of drops on them approximately 2-3 weeks after that particular area opened up.<P>Number 2:  Taunt was bad enough using these weapons or any 1h handed weapons with a proc on them.  Ask any warrior who has fought any mob that is above 50.  And you just nerfed it more.<P>Number 3:  I have a dex unbuffed of 175 if I wish wearing certain items while using proc type weapons.  You should have taken a poll on how many warriors have that type dex unbuffed for one.  I can all ready give you that answer.  Very few.  So in reality you have just completed what I would call a major nerf concerning these weapons based on stats only a small percentage of us warriors have.<P>Number 4:  There were several posts before this patch came out of warriors who were concerned about 2h weapons for example doing more damage and asking that these weapons be able to INCREASE the taunt factor not DECREASE it.  Apparently that was not included into this decision making regarding the patch.<P>Ok lets go onto bind wounds.  LOL...Nice change after the rest of the warriors that are now Warlords have given up on the idea of binding to 75%.  It was just too frustrating for them to continue because at that age most of time you fight in a group which has some type of healer in it.  Myself, yes I have a skill of 208 in the skill.  But very few warriors do.<P>On item drops:  There were several posts regarding drops of warrior armor.  Its reality that this is true what warriors posted about.  The same thing has happened that has always happened in the past in your world.  About 2 weeks after an area opens up the amount of drops of any type item are nerfed dramatically.  This is sad as what a warrior depends on most is his equipment.  Also up on the planes like POH and POG now and see exactly percentage wise how much warrior armor drops compared to all other classes.  Not much.<P>Basically what you have done with this patch is made warriors safer LOL..and made a casters or a hybrids life shorter while fighting.  Hmm..thought we were tanks and as such taunted the mobs and kept the casters and hybrids alive?  So what is our role now?  Oh great!  Now we can dish out damage and kick the you-know-what out of mobs and stay alive longer.  With this proc change on reduced taunt you have reduced us to damage givers.  Someone correct me if I am wrong but 75% of our weapons that are 50+ level use are proc weapons?<P>Now, as a suggestion Verant please add the following to balance and fix some problems.  Give us a discipline of aoe taunt (and I don't mean one with 60 min reuse time either.  We as Warlords have earned the right and the title by dying for others.  Make the 2h weapons more powerful for if you don't trust me..casters and hybrids will now die faster no matter what we as warriors try to do to save them.  Increase the drops on warrior armor and weapons as this is Equipment + Experience = Well-Balanced Warrior.  And last, please fix those blasted disciplines, ie. reuse time should be cut in 1/2 if you reach Warlord Status.<P>Thanks for listening,<BR>Gigantuous-60th Warlord<BR>Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I don't want to sound like a broken record here but, come on, warriors are turning out to be nothing but meat shields to be carried around by druids and wizards. I can't count the times I've run through a zone to be jumped by several green cons that kill me in a matter of seconds, yet a paladin or ranger runs through with no problem. We haven't been nerfed but all the other fighter classes have been buffed, this is almost as bad as a nerf. I'm not saying I won't get a group now that the AC of Paladins is the same as warriors or that rangers have the same melee skills as warriors, I feel that these classes should get them, but come on throw the warriors a bone. You want us to be meat shield to stand and take hits? Then take away all our melee skills then so that we can do the job and not get in the others way. If someone researches their characters before making them and was originally thinking of making a warrior, whats to stop them from making a ranger because they fight the same now, except warriors get crits with half the time don't do much more damage then regular hits, or a paladin which now gets the same defense skills as a warrior and can tank a little better? When I see a warrior in my mind I think of someone who mastered all weapon skills fighting numerous things at once and not getting themselves killed in the process, not a shield to be taken place to place. Yes I know rangers aren't tank, and paladins aren't tanks, but in real life terms you know what a tank is? A slow moving, heaving hitting behemoth that is used for support, and when caught out in the open is easy for slaughter. I didn't start my warrior so long ago to become that, if I wanted them to be that he would have been a troll or ogre not a dark elf, I made my warrior to dance around the fight dealing damage with finesse and skill, not just sit and trade blows.<P>Yes this is a vent, but I still feel that warriors need more defenses for certain situations, and a little more versitility. All we have to rely on is our equipment, party and skills which well our skills are being given to other classes, whats next all our good equipment gonna be given to others too? What about our places in raids and groups?

</FONT><HR>Cheer up, guys, if nothing wants to hit us, we won't be "meat shields", we'll be... um... Last Man... er... Troll Standing  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">.<P>Maybe they made other changes to taunt/hatelist management that weren't publicized and we'll be pleasantly surprised. If not, I, too, would question these changes. At L55, I have a difficult time taunting L51+ mobs off folks using the taunt skill. I group with paladins and SKs fairly often and they can guarantee a taunt via spell. I agree that the overtaunt of the spells in question was likely intended to be a balance against the parent class (Cleric Stuns, Necromancer Heartflutter line).  However it's a huge plus for the hybrid classes, rather than a minus.<P>I think about the following group:<BR>Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter, Hybrid, Druid, XXXXXX.<P>You'd think an effective combat sequence would look something like this:<BR>1 - mob pulled by warrior, fight starts<BR>2 - mob aggros on either enchanter for debuffing, cleric for healing, or druid for dmg or healing.<BR>3 - Warrior hits taunt, Hybrid tosses 1 spell and gets the mob's attention.<BR>4 - warrior taunts off the hybrid, goes back to tanking<BR>5 - mob dies, group rejoices.<P>Unfortunately, the more common scenario changes to the following<BR>4 - Warrior tries to taunt, nothing happens.<BR>5 - repeat 4 about 20 times until either hybrid dies, mob re-aggros on cleric, enchanter, or druid, or mob dies.<BR>6 - several folks look at the warrior and ask whether he's taunting. <P>Far-fetched? Not really. Sebilis, a week ago, in the Jail area, vs low 50s frogs (blue to me). Granted, I don't have a jade mace or lamentation (best taunting weapon I have at the moment is Jarsath trident, at 11/22). But I figured sooner or later I'd be able to taunt off the hybrid. <P>I'm not about to run around screaming "The Sky if Falling!" as a result of this patch, or making threats to quit.  I _do_ urge the design folks to come follow my group around for a few days and see what a _typical_ group of folks (mid 50s, playing since April 99, decent but not uber gear) is experiencing on a day to day basis.<P>heck, examine all the folks in our group, clone one of them with a new name and play that character in our group for a week. I know that the verant folks play the game, but if some of these changes are any indication, it doesn't feel like they're playing the same game, for whatever reason.<P>As it stands, the much touted Defensive Discipline may soon only be useful for living a few seconds longer after the rest of your group is dead. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, not a bad list.<P>The most obvious thing to me that is missing is a sprint discipline, or some other escape mechanism.<P>Although I bought Vellious as soon as it came out, I still havent been there with my 45 warrior, because I figure for sure some green mob will catch and kill me and I will be taking that long boat ride back for my corpse, probably to die again.<P>The other obvious thing that is missing is weapon specialization. Although this could be part of "nothing to look forward to from 35 - 50".<P>I think as of todays patch, my 45 warrior is officially in retirement. I have good armor I think (ac 817 at lv45), but my weapons are just too lame to do any damage or taunt. I cant even raise the cash for a couple of Yaks on Lanys, and it seems like a Wyrmslayer is the norm now. There was nothing to help taunt with a 2hs. <P>The lame part of being a warrior, is that you cant get to 50 just by hunting in outdoor zones. That is what I did, and you end up hopelessly broke and under-equipped.<P>I suppose if you want to play a warrior, I would say either make sure you play on an old server, where equipment is plentiful and cheap, or play a druid first, then twink your warrior. <P>Doing what I did, playing a warrior as your main on a young server, is just stupid. It's way to hard. It involves either working up a trade skill to where it is profitable, trading in EC full time for a couple of months, or 100's and 100's of hours of solo camping green mobs with lame drops (because low green is all you can kill solo and no one will group with an under equipped warrior).<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Its totally bogus that casters regeneration rate goes up with their level yet ours is the same at level fifty as it is at level 10.  40 levels with no advances in our regeneration rate is PATHETIC.<P>AC cap- Lift the ac cap, its stupid to have us aquire higher ac equipment just to end up with a cap.

Right now Wis and int casters can pump all of their stat points into one thing, int or wis and make a tremendous difference in their performance.  We have to work on four different stats for minimal difference in our performance.   Changing our stats to mean something would also help shamans stat buffs make them more useful.<P>Melee bind points-  Just let us be bound in all ourdoor areas.

</FONT><HR>LOL - I could not believe these recemt patches at all.  Let's see here...<P>Bump some hybrids defense up to the same level as warriors (who are primarily defensive) and the other hybrid meleers to the same offensive level.  Now reduce the taunting effectiveness of weapon procs, make the monks FD sorta useless, and the rogues' evade only a 'tiny' evade.  And, in the interest of intelligent pumas (like pumas have strategic awareness of some sort) let's make the heals even more of a taunt along with some other spells.  Now let's really tick off the player base and make the epic quests cheesy and make 5th level turtles with 35K hitpoints.  And then let's have every greenie in the zone attack the warrior and actually hit him a lot even though he could not possible hit a red con that far above himself.<P>That is just too dang funny.  <P>ARE YOU BLIND?  Why would any group even want a warrior over a Paladin and monk now?  Same defense and better offense, great stuns, decent control in pulls plus mana reducing heals, bandaging, mends, and great taunting from spells and damage/round.  hahahaha.  <P>Do not lie to us and tell us that you look at the big picture.  It is quite obvious that you simply compared a class to another class and did not consider class function within a group or multi-group environment.  Why would I want a wall of warriors when I can ENSURE the same defensive capability WITH a far better taunting effectiveness using a wall of Paladins (stuns on mobs and small heals on the self will keep mob attention easily - but then, we didn't think of that now did we)?<P>If you were going to get rid of the class, why didn't you just say so.  I've been playing strategy, fantasy, online games for many many years and at 42 years of real life age, Verant wins the prize for the least thought with "balancing issues".<P>Seriously fix the class or remove it.  You've made your point, Verant, about not wanting any class to be essential (essential classes is a basic foundation of well-rounded gaming and groups but hey - we're in your world now - hehe).  Now that the warrior is no longer essential, let's remove it from the class list.<P>Alternately, allow those of us that wish, to sponsor our own world servers and administer a wider variety of quests and games and gaming balance hueristics.  These "player owned" servers could cost an additional premium by the server owner and might be accessible within the main server selection screen.  There would be liabilities and benefits that I'll defer to the VI staff, but there would certainly be diversity.  Perhaps these sponsored servers would be private or public depending upon the sponsor's wishes.  In any case, it would allow a server sponsor to tune things as he or she sees appropriate and to share that tuning with other server sponsors and VI.<P>(OK - I've complained and offered a solution - hehe.  But think about it ... Neverwinter Nights is going to be released soon so get competitive with that structure now.)<P>Tirk<BR>48th level warrior - retired (aka deleted)<BR>now 1st level Paladin ...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I totally agree with the above post about playing before complaining.  Another thing we have to realize is that they have not yet done a patch for warriors and other classes which tells me they are not done.  I am giving VI the benefit of the doubt here.  If they weren't going to do anything with the warrior then they would have included us in this patch.  Also have to remember that fixes or tweaks to us isn't easy considering we are the base class of the others.  Maybe they made others equal to us, in some ways, to balance out what they could do for us.  Nerfing proc taunt for a higher good.  Who knows but I will be one to wait and see and save my judgements and critizism for that day.<P>However, if nothing good and helpful comes out of this warrior patch then I will be the first to lose all respect for people that do not listen to or at least try to understand what their PAYING customers are telling them.<P>Good patchwork for the other classes.

</FONT><HR>ABSOR:  Ok, it seems that I was misinformed. The message is displayed, just not in the right order. I'll take that off the list.<P>	Thanks for addressing the real importan issues... such as where the riposte message is.  We have been asking for months to get that message moved down a line.<P>ABSOR:  And we are perfectly aware of the way that class envy works. And it has nothing to do with class balance. The classes can be well balanced and there will still be such a thing as class envy. In fact, I would think that class envy might be a sign of a good healthy class balance. If there was no such thing as class envy, then that might indicate that the classes were too much alike. Not balanced, but homogenized.<P>Shaman:	Superior Healing moved to level 51 for shamans and druids.  <BR>  &	New level 55 Druid and shaman spell, Chloroblast, similar to remedy for clerics. <P>Druid:	New Druid spell at level 60, upgrade to superior healing, Natures Touch. <BR>	Added Endure Magic spell at level 30 <P>Paladin: Added Resist Magic at 55 <BR>	 Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors <BR>	Added Yaulp 4 at 60 and enhanced. <P>Shadow	Added Drain Soul at level 60 <BR>Knight:	Grim Aura added at level 22 and enhanced <BR>	Added Diamondskin spell at 59 <BR>	Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors <P>Ranger:  Added Endure Cold at 22 <BR>	Added Skin Like Nature at 59 <BR>	Added FireFist at 22 <BR>	Added resist cold at 55 <BR>	Added Panic Animal at 22 <BR>	Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors <P>Bard:	Added new level 20 Bard Song: Cassindra`s Chant of Clarity <BR>Bards defensive skill made exactly the same as a warriors <BR>	<P>	Something about not trying to homogenize classes?<BR>	<BR>ABSOR:  The hate list is, at least in part, one of the ways that the NPC AI determines what it's going to do. Setting it up so that a warrior, with the push of a button, can determine how the NPC is going to act in a fight would be silly. The more powerful the NPC, the less we want him to be controlled by the desires of the players. After all, the higher level the monster is the more intelligent (or experienced) it is supposed to be. What we really want is for the NPCs to act as much like PCs as they can. How many times to you, as a player character, turn away from the caster that you are destroying just because a warrior type NPC comes up behind you and calls you names (or stick sharp things into your behind, for that matter)? Unless he's going to kill you, you probably don't. Killing the caster is more important.<P>	There is a huge difference between PC's and NPC's.  Trying to make any comparison between the two is rediculous.  How many times have you been slain by NPC's, only to find them /random'ing your items off and splitting your PP?  I have never seen a Froglock Zol Knight say "Frog group looking for an enchanter."  <P>ABSOR:  So giving complete control to the warrior to decide who the NPCs attack would be a bad thing for the game.<P>	I agree.  Taunt should not be a magic button, but it should work at least semi-reliably.<P>ABSOR:  There is a delicate balance to maintain, though. And we are aware of it. But you also need to be aware that controlling the actions of the NPCs is always going to be a group activity. <BR>If your group works at it they can, for the most part, convince the NPC to attack the target you choose. It requires that, for example, your casters watch how much damage they do and when they do it. Just because they can chain cast direct damage spells does not mean that they should. The same applies to fighter types. It's up to the group to control aggro, not just the warrior.<P>	While pulling, especially in dungeons where Spirit of Wolf/Jboots etc do not work, melee classes will take damage.  When we get back to our group with the mob, we take more damage because we are first on the hate list.  The healer will heal us.  Now the mob is attacking the healer.  We mash taunt.  Assuming it works, the mob is now on us.  The healer will then proceed to heal himself (naturally).  Now the mob is back on the healer. Suppose taunt fails.  Now the healer is trying to keep himself alive by healing, the whole time building up much more agro than the warrior.  Direct damage aside, warriors need a reliable way to keep healers alive.  Healers have a wealth of ways to keep us alive, we should at least be able to return the favor.<P><BR>ABSOR:  Exactly. And those things do matter. Warriors have more AC on their equipment, more hit points, more stamina (were a hybrid gets either Int or Wis). And in all cases a similarly leveled warrior will have better defensive skills. Just looking at hit points is very much underestimating the whole warrior package.<P>	Just looking at AC on items is also very much underestimating the whole package. Look at stat buffs compared to usefulness to the class.  Look at effects on the item as it is useful to the class (grouped and ungrouped).  If you aren't going to look at the whole picture, stop telling us to do it.<P>ABSOR:  To put it plainly; no, we're not going to explain the AC mechanics in extreme detail. If you observe you should see that the warrior has the advantage in all cases. Don't focus on hit points, as they are only part of the equation.<P>	We have higher hit points and more AC on our class armor, you said that already.  What is this 'equation' you seem to know so much about?  Tell us what the whole equation is so we can have an understanding as to how it all works.  Nothing in great detail, just an outline.  <P>ABSOR:  I've been thinking about this whole specialization thing. At first I kinda skipped it because it would require some serious time and effort to make it work. It's certainly not something that would happen any time soon. And, well, think about it. Warriors that are 'specialized' in a weapon are going to be noticeably better using it. Right now, warriors do just about the right amount of damage (again, that's kind of the problem when you're the 'base' class for something). So we wouldn't want to increase the effectiveness of warrior damage. So we'd have to make it so that warriors with specialization do about the same damage that they do now, and we'd have to make it so that they would do less damage than they do now with their non-specialized weapons.<P>That was my first thought on it, so I skipped it.<P>But I'll add it to the list. It's still a good idea, in principle. It would allow for warriors to be a little more diverse. <P>	You are contradicting yourself.  How can specializing make us more diverse?  You said in the first paragraph that it will force us to use a certain type of weapon (the one we specialize in). That doesn't seem very diverse.  <P>ABSOR:  On Disarm… well, basically, I see no way to make this skill more viable without making it far too viable. I'll add this to the list, but I don't know that it can be made more useful. No, I will not advocate removing the skill. Remember, taking it out will not automatically entitle warriors to some other skill to replace it, that's not how this works.<P>	OK. Just give us more skills without taking things away.  That method has worked so far for the hybrids. Disarm is not something you should even consider.  The only time disarm is very useful is when you are dueling/PVP.  Disarming your opponent may cause him/her to lose a round of attacks.  Disarm has no real effect on mobs and should not be considered vital to the whole balance issue.  <P>ABSOR:  Separate issue, but still in the works. We'll make an announcement on this when it happens. It has not been forgotten. But understand that we're not talking about a whole lot of new bind spots. We're talking about a few, perhaps a couple.<P>	Several classes get new spells.  Hybrids get big jumps in skill caps.  We get more places to beg for binds.  SWEET!

</FONT><HR>As posted by Abbrrach:<BR>Regeneration: this needs to have a skill so we can regain it at the same percentage as casters gain mana. <P>Stats: They dont have nearly the effect that they should for melee classes.<P>Guard: Skill that would allow us to set our guard onto one player and whenever something tried to hit that player we would throw ourseves into the path of the creature.<P>Raise AC cap: We need the AC cap raised. Haveing higher AC armor is worthless if there is a cap. <BR>_________________________________________<BR>My Comments:<BR>Regen would be nice, or better Binds Wounds, which today's patch may have covered, but I'm not sure. It was vague. My Bind Wounds is maxed for my level right now, and only heals me up to 50%. Casters can get into action quicker when they have Meditate. Warriors should have the equivilent for health. It should also stack for those races that get the ability naturally, such as Trolls and Iksar, so that we aren't taking it away from them, just enhancing it. Also, Bandages should increase the amount they can heal based on your skill, or perhaps Dexterity. Make some of our stats do something to help.<P>Stats, High Strength should affect damage more, and carrying capacity. Bronze armor weighs alot, and decked out in suck heavy armor as warriors wear, we can't afford to carry many other things. I don't know what the difference in Agility and Dex are, except that Agility affects AC and I believe speed when we get over burdened.<P>Guard sounds nice, but could be abused. A better ability might be Engage, which allows a Warrior to put himself in the way between a creature and Caster or other class, and engage it in combat, preventing it from being able to get around the warrior to attack others unless they move within melee range. The problem I see with Guard is that it could yank a warrior around, almost like teleporting them as mobs can do at times, and can be abused too easily that way, or make things difficult for the warrior if the person he is guarding tries running and drags the warrior along.<P>And there shouldn't be a AC cap for warriors. Higher AC prevents damage better, or reduces damage taken, which should negate the need for higher hit points.<P>Specializing in a type of combat would be nice also. And allowing warriors to stun with something other then a shield since many of use use two handed weapons, or dual-wield. Kick should stun perhaps. Specializing should be in Type of Attack, not specific weapons, such as Specializing in 2HS, 1HS, Dual-Weild, Piercing, 1HB, 2HB, Unarmed, Dodge, Parry, etc. Specializing could also perhaps decrease delay speeds for weapons, to make warriors attack quicker, like a innate Quickness ability (like the Enchanter spell.)<BR>_________________________________________<BR>Posted by Slamz:<BR>ITEM: Respect.<BR>---<P>I would almost rather see a "sprint" discipline than this. The whole point is that when we die, we have to run to our corpses. You can't always get a ressurection, especially at low levels, and if you can't find someone to SOW you, you're looking at a very dangerous trip that can quite easily give you a naked death. We're completely helpless when we're unarmed, so any green con mob can end up kicking our butts. Very, very frustrating, and we are the ONLY class that has no method of dealing with this. Making greens not attack us or giving us a "sprint" discipline that lets us run faster for a short period of time would be nice.<BR>_________________________________________<BR>My Comments:<BR>This idea is nice also. How about, if a Warrior is under half their carrying capacity (Such as when naked and running to retrieve a corpse) They can sprint at high speeds. I don't see it being abused because warriors would be sacrificing their AC by running that low on equipment. Perhaps 25% of carrying capacity if 50% is too high.<P>As for not being able to solo, I don't like that at all. Often I can't find a group, even at low levels. I can just imagine what hell it would be at higher levels. I would group with my guild members, but many of them are higher levels, and I don't want them to be baby sitting me so I can get to higher levels with them. I won't group with idiots who can't spell correctly, show respect to others, or are only interested in getting the Phat Lewt. Necro's, Druids, and other classes can solo, but from what I hear, it's impossible for warriors. At 19th level, a blue centaur could nearly kill me when the fight started with me at full health. I only survived by running to the bridge to North Karana. Whites should be equal, and possible to die from fighting them without good buffs and great equipment, and blues should be killable, with lots of damage taken perhaps. How creatures Con is seriously messed up in most cases. I understand that grouping was attempted in the game to try and involve people together in a community, but it's not working for everyone, and is a serious hassle for people. Stop worrying so much about enforced grouping. People group for fun when possible, but without grouping, the game should still be fun.<BR>_________________________________________<P>Jaarus Star<BR>19th Circle Wood Elf Warrior of Tunare<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Warriors: <BR>	Its all good but admittedly unbalancing if it all went in.  Still it is nice to dream. And people have posted some great great ideas here. My remarks on each proposed item logged below.<BR>	<BR>ITEM: AoE Taunt. <BR>DESCRIPTION: The ability to 'taunt' all of the creatures in your combat range. This would have to be a high level ability, most likely a discipline. <BR>My Remark:<BR>	It would be handly for sure, but I am having trouble visualizing what RL action this would represent.  Taunt, as I understand it, is the ability to piss off a MOB through, name calling, shin kicking, etc. to the point where the MOB will concentrate its efforts into making that warrior pay.  How exactly would this be done to a group of enemies, only at the very begining of a melee as I see it.  Once the fight starts you would not be effective in shouting hey everyone my hamster fights better then you guys.  Sorry but I view the game as a simulation of an altered reality.  Unless someone can explain this one to me, I think it should be limited to the very begining of melee.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Increased Hit Points: <BR>DESCRIPTION: Some warriors feel that their hit points are too low, at least at the high levels. <BR>My Remark:<BR>	Yes, Yes, Oh Yes !  I recently passed level 40.  I found the HP were adequate up to this point suddenly I am finding this Meat Sheild does not have enough meat.  The MOBs are hitting much more than propotionatly harder then at lower levels, and my HP increase has remain constant.  From talking to senior warriors, this is much worse above level 50.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Bind Wound Improvement. <BR>DESCRIPTION: An increase in the ability to bind wounds would reduce downtime for a warrior when not grouped with a healer. Of course this would also reduce their downtime when fighting solo. <BR>My Remark:<BR>	Nice yes, but the fellow who made the comment about the price of bandages, plus the weight was right on the money.  Who can afford to restore HP like this on a consistant basis.  Given the choice I would rather see the effect of bind wound doubled or better yet tripled.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Two-Handed weapons and taunt. <BR>DESCRIPTION: The consensus is that slower weapons taunt less, no matter the damage level generated. If this is the case, perhaps finding some way to make these weapons taunt more would make them more popular. <BR>My Remark:<BR>	This is consistant with my experience.  I cannot use 2HS weapons in a group for fear I will get my team killed from me not effectively taunting.  I have a great 2HS weapon that I can only use solo....read as (never).<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Furious discipline is bugged. <BR>DESCRIPTION: Furious, the level 56 discipline, appears to be broken. It seems that it allows ripostes on all attacks, even those that come from the rear. Against attacks from the back, it prevents the attack and the damage, but then reports the 'you can't see your target' message, and fails to deliver damage to the attacker. <BR>My Remark: <BR>	Not sure but I hope it is fixed by the time I get to 56.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Cobalt Helm and Bracer. <BR>DESCRIPTION: Players feel that the drop rate on these two items is far lower than it is on the rest of the Cobalt armor, and they would like it increased. <BR>My Remark: <BR>	These are a little out of my reach right now.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Critical hits for low damage. <BR>DESCRIPTION: When a warrior gets a critical hit, having it hit for less than a normal hit can be distressing. Perhaps putting a minimum damage on a crit (or raise it if there is one now) to be close to their normal maximum damage would be a good idea. So, if the damage generated is less than their normal maximum, raise it to that maximum. <BR>My Remark: <BR>	Yes ! Embarassing to even call these critical hits.  I would like to go one futher and have criticals and crips add a DOT to the target to simulate uncontrolled bleeding or damaged vitals.  Crips add stun but I think it should be longer..ever had a boot to the acorns.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Better Taunt. <BR>DESCRIPTION: Warriors want to be able to taunt more effectively at the higher levels. It may be, though, that the problem isn't with their ability to taunt, but with the taunting of other classes. Also, players are not supposed to be able to dictate the actions of higher level monsters. They are supposed to be smart enough to kill who they think needs killing, and they are not supposed to be tricked by simple name calling… But this should be looked at along with the big picture, perhaps warriors should have a greater ability to taunt. <BR>My Remark: <BR>	Taunting is the entire value of a Warrior as a group class.  If we have no group value we are dead above 20, we all know that.  The point about high level mobs is well taken, however is not taken into account in the skill system.  When you become a high level master taunter, you should be able to make the coolest calmest people snap.  You must not be a sports fan if you think high levels make you immune to taunting.  Big part of pretty much every high level professional sport.  Also are not some high level mobs still dumb animals.  The statement that the problem is with the taunting of other classes is missing the point.  Taunt works poorly at higher levels, what ever is causeing it should be addressed.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Piercing skill cap. <BR>DESCRIPTION: As the masters of all weapons, do they not deserve the highest cap on all weapon skills? <BR>My Remark:<BR>	Yes we are designed to be the weapon masters, cannot change that now.  We put a lot of work into keeping all of our weapon skills up. <BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Berserker Frenzy as a skill. <BR>DESCRIPTION: This has the potential to be significantly overpowering, but it's certainly interesting. The idea is to turn berserking into a skill or discipline with a recycle time and a duration that balances out the fact that they can do this at will. This might also mean the removal of the berserk code for low health. Perhaps the berserk skill would drain stamina and then, when stamina was gone, hit points. <BR>My Remark: <BR>	Yes I always thought this skill should have been in the game, but not replacing the current automatic low HP version.  That one simulates the warrior desperatly fighting for the last of his life.  What I propose is a new Skill.  Historically the Viking Berserkers would work themselves into a rage before battle that was said to make them invincible in combat.  The down side was that sometimes they would completely loose control and keep fighting after the battle was over.  Sometimes continuing to hack at the bodies of fallen enemies, or worse turning on the next closest standing target friend or foe.  Of course Berserkers usually wore a minimal of armour usually animal skins.  It was also believed that especilally skilled Berserkers could shapechange into either a Bear or Wolf form.<BR>		I would not expect to see this skill added to the game to reflect all of that.  But this would be interesting to have as a skill called Rage or Frenzy that you could evoke when under half HP - makes you for a short time invunerable and hit like a demon, maybe 40% haste +15 STR. Downside possible loss of control, will keep switching to next nearest target until character regains control.  High charisma characters should have a chance to calm down a warrior gone amok, with a bonus added if opposite sex.  Because of the risk of using this skill it would be used only in dire curcumstances or during a corpse run to hack through waves of greens.<P>--- <BR>ITEM: Iksar Planar armor. <BR>DESCRIPTION: It seems there isn't any. <BR>My Remark: <BR>	Best start stitching some up.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Respect. <BR>DESCRIPTION: The idea here would be that a deadly warrior shouldn't be jumped on by little green beetles when wandering back to his corpse. They should fear his dangerous fighting power. The gameplay point here is that warriors have no way of travelling safely among otherwise annoying greens. Where a caster would go invisible, a warrior has to fight off hordes of weak enemies. <BR>My Remark: <BR>	I think my Frenzy idea above covers this.  If not how about a Battle Cry skill that will evoke fear in all nearby greens(only) and send them running in all  directions.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Nothing to look forward to from 35th to 50th. <BR>DESCRIPTION: There are no skills for a warrior to gain in this level range. One suggestion about what could be added is some sort of sweeping blow skill that would allow a warrior to hit multiple targets within his combat range. This should probably only work with a two-handed weapon. The skill would be linked to the Bash and Kick timers, and would probably not do full damage to each creature, perhaps only doing a comparable amount of damage with Bash. <BR>My Remark: <BR>	Yes quite dry in those levels.<BR>	I like the sweeping blow.  Slashing weapons would be a natural for a skill like this, but i do not think it should be limited to 2HS.  It is pehaps even easier to hit multiple targets dual wielding.  Here are some other skill ideas to throw in the pot and smoke.<BR>	How about a retrieve arrow skill that allows you to find some of those arrows you just shot.<BR>	Or a strategy skill that adds to the effectivness of all the party members only if you are the leader.<BR>	A Shield Wall or Line of Battle skill or discipline that adds more AC and defense depending on how many other warriors are in your group with the same skill. 	<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Equiping shields on the back. <BR>DESCRIPTION: Allowing shields to be used in back slots. A popular idea, and it makes some sense, assuming the shield only gave an armor class bonus from the back. <BR>My Remark: <BR>	Do it whats the big deal.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Riposte damage report. <BR>DESCRIPTION: Some would like to have the damage they do with a riposte reported to them. <BR>STATUS: None <BR>My Remark: <BR>	Just fix it so it works like it should.<P>I hope some of these ideas may spark others.

</FONT><HR>Absor said:  "Ah, yes. But how about looking at it the other way. After all, once I deal with the soft and mushy wizard I can get down to dealing with that annoying thorn in my side. Because the caster is easier to get rid of, get rid of him first.<P>Isn’t that what players do?"<P>No.<P>SOP on a multiple pull:  You jump the biggest, meanest, nastiest, hardest-to-control sucker in the bunch and let the enchanter work his mojo on the lesser stuff, *especially* the casters.  Why?  Because he can whip out Theft of Thought and leech mana off the casters, and keep them mezzed all damn day long.<P>This works.  In the Hole versus rock golems (53+ are impossible to mez, thank you for not changing your ridiculous "old world" rules on that) and in Sebilis vs. mixed pulls of knights/wizzies/shamans, take the biggest first, mez the rest including the casters, and leech their mana until you're ready to dispatch them.<P>Absor, we have been screaming on these threads for weeks now, for one thing:  TAUNTING.  If you are going to make us be nothing more than meatshields, then by God, GIVE US THE TOOLS TO DO THE JOB.  Don't hand me this crap about "we don't want one warrior controlling the behavior of a mob"...then why do we even have the taunt key, hmm?<P>As a warrior what the hell am I supposed to do when I can't taunt off the shadowknight next to me because he can drop a spell on it?  What the hell am I supposed to do when a Chloroblast or Superior Heal agros a mob onto my druid?  What the hell am I supposed to do when the cleric drops a 3000-point Complete Heal on me and gets himself so far ahead of me on the hate list that I can't save him?  Is he just supposed to let me die?  Maybe keep dribbling Greater Heals out on me?<P>Raise the taunt cap.  Make taunt WORK on whites and yellows at greatly reduced chances.  If you are going to shove us kicking and screaming into the role of "defensive tank," then please let us do the job you force us to do, or else re-evaluate our role.<P>Don't nerf hybrids.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Warriors do have more equipment, that is for sure. I'm looking at Alakhazam's Magical Realm right now, for the equipment. And for humans, of paladin, shadow knight, and warriors, for their chest piece, this is how many things I found.<P>&lt;take not, might be off by 2 or 3 for each&gt;<P>shadow knights, 92<BR>paladins, 92<BR>warriors, 98<P>Now the highest ac for paladins and shadow knights is 42, but warriors if 47.<P>This small increase, even with a warriors bonus, does not mean they have more ac. Now paladins and shadow knights have the same defence cap as warriors?<P>This small ac bonus on chest pieces, and from each other piece I would assume, is not that much. Now take in part the spells they can cast on their selves, and then you can see why some warriors are upset.<P>Can you justify, that the lack of stamina, a few hp, and a little of their melee power, is balanced by their spells?<P>Warriors are dependent on groups and equipment. Make most warrior equipment higher up, No Drop. Well, most items that high should be. It is bad enough to see casters farm items at any levels, but up then it really matters.<P>The only advice I can give to warriors who need equipment is go steal those spells that are 50+ that drop off of creatures, so that you can trade it for the armor they have of yours.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First I need to address Ehryk's remark about Warriors not being able to solo past level 25 or whatever nonsense he claimed. I am a 48 Ogre Warrior and 98% of my time has been spent SOLOING because I play at odd hours. I know what I am doing, I have decent kit and I know what to hunt. I can solo well into level 52 because I know what to hunt. In the future, please don't speak for the entire Warrior class with your rhetoric when it does not apply to everyone. Thanks.<P>Now, as for this thread's intentional purpose. I have some ideas that I'd like to share with the rest of my Warrior brethren as well as the Verant development team. I have a strong AD&D background and it is very obvious that EQ is a game based on AD&D. Though it is NOT AD&D, its concepts are principally the same. <P>First I would like to address people's ideologies about Warriors not being the masters of damage; their place solely to stand there and taunt and take damage. This is the most riduclous stereotype I have heard about a class. That is like saying the only thing Necros are good for is fearing and Druids are only good for gating when each class of those classes has so many other abilities. Warriors ARE, by every definition of role play gaming, THE definitive combatant. That is their function - to fight, not just take damage. As it is, Rogues can outdamage most Warriors on a ratio of 5:1 at higher levels if they are attacking a mob from behind. Has anyone ever seen Conan the Barbarian? You think that little thief buddy of Conan's could take Conan face to face? Hell no! Rogues get their dmg bonus from backstabbing and that is fine. However, if they were to duel a Warrior, they should totally get owned; Not because the Warrior has more health thus lasting longer in combat, but because the Warrior is the master of face to face weapon-related combat. Rogues should get their backstab and evade - Warriors should be dealing out WAY more damage than any other melee class - PERIOD!<P>This idea is directly related to taunting which is a major role in a Warrior's life. Warriors have massive amounts of health because they are combatants who stand face to face with the enemy, not some wuss Rogue who has to fight from behind to avoid being hit or being the center of attention. Warriors need to be doing more damage. If you had some average sized-guy stabbing at you 15 times a minute with a knife, do you really think he would be more effective than a huge brute guy swinging a double-bladed axe 8 times a minute? Mobs usually go after the most effective attacker which usually equates to the one doing the most harm to them (or in the Clerics case, healing for huge amounts of health). I suggest Weapon Specialization to give Warriros back their title of King of Combat. This is how I think it should work -<P>A Warrior chooses one weapon type to master. The benefit of using this one type of weapon is that the damage they do with each hit is never below half of the maximum damage they can do with that weapon. Let's look at Necro/Shaman pets. They have this ability to hit for 35-45 on EVERY hit...rarely 2's or 3's. Here you have a summoned mob with no former fighting experience with the innate ability to hit for 35 - 45 damage. Just because it is an NPC doesn't make that right. No pet should ever outdamage a battle hardened Warrior of equal level - EVER!<P>My Ogre Warior with 218 Strength does anywhere from 2 to 120 dmg on a single hit with a Wurmslayer. Think about that - OGRE - WARRIOR - HUGE STRENGTH - VERY DAMAGING WEAPON - doing 2 points of damage. I use EQParser to test weapons and their effectiveness. I see many 2's and 3's showing up, many 30's and many 50's out of a max of 120 on a normal blow. I am sorry, but I am a HUGE BEHEMOTH FIGHTING MACHINE! Two damage in a single hit is like stubbing your toe, if that. In real life, if you were hit by a 500 lbs. muscle machine weilding a 10 lbs Polearm, do you think a little tap is going do give you only a little knick when every swing is intentionally made to take your head off? I didn't think so. Weapon specialization should give the Warrior the ability to do a minimum of half that weapon's maximum damage on every hit. Warriors are meant to deal out and take damage. I am sure Rogues would still out damage Warriors even with this specialization, but at least it would bring us closer to our true role of being masters of combat, both offensive and defensive.<P>Critical Hits - You don't put someone in the hospital listed under critical conidtion for a sliver in their finger. So why would you have Warriors doing only 2 - 13 damage on a critical hit if they (take for instance my situation with a Wurmslayer that I) can do 120 dmg on a maximum hit? 2 - 13 damage is not critical, it is substandard. You either need to rename the Critical Hit to "A hit different than your ordinary hit" or make the critical hit just what it is supopsed to mean - CRITICAL! To me, and almost EVERY other person out there - a critical hit implies hitting the enemy with such a force or blow that is does MAXIMUM damage. If I take an axe and hit you in the leg with it, only making a gash in your leg, that is a pretty good hit. If I take the same axe and amputate your leg in a blow - THAT is a critical hit. Verant needs to establish that norm of damage relation. A Critical hit should NEVER do less than the weapon's maximum damage output for a single hit. A Crippling Blow (which, if I am not mistaken should be more damaging than a critical hit by Verant's standards) should be even worse - making the hit no less than TWICE the weapon's maximum damage. Verant should have thought about what those words meant before they coded their effects. Either rename them or make them what they are supopsed to be. In actuality, you should also switch the names around - Critical is life threathening, crippling is like losing a hand or a leg. You wouldn't call an amputee a critical, you call them (non-politcally correct) crippled. Sure, you can die from losing a hand or a leg, but critical is almost always meant as your life is on the line. A baseball bat applied to your skull at full force...THAT is a critical blow.<P>Race should also play a huge factor in how effective a Warrior is. If you have a level 50 Halfling and Ogre Warrior, with the exact same equipment, is it not logical that the Ogre would obliterate the Halfling? I see all these Elf Warriors running around looking all pretty. Sure, they should be effective because they are Warriors by class, but given that Warriors are meant to be big and strong you should give Trolls and Ogres a huge advantage in dishing out the damage. For example, if Lennox Lewis were to take on Oscar De La Hoya in a boxing match, do you think Oscar would stand a chance at beating Lennox?? They are both at the top of the game in their weight division, but when you pit each against other you get a clear definition of size IS important and, regardless of your skill, is a huge factor in who the winner will be. There are few fatties running around (even though they are superior to elves in combat) because everyone wants to look pretty so they make Elves. Well, I say let those people be pretty but take a hit ability-wise compared to the big fatties out there that are meant to be Warriors. Give Ogres and Trolls more advantage in combat over smaller class Warriors - it is common sense.<P>I know there will be opposition to this post. I have my opinion, you have yours. Maybe some day I'll make an RPG and code it with more realistic factors. Until then, I offer you my suggestions in hoping to make the Warrior class more suited for what it is suposed to be -  master of combat. Thanks for listening (reading).<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

No one wants to play a warrior cause after 20 and before your disciplines you will almost never solo anything decent. While, a monk can do it and still almost be full health (mend). Oh and dont forget rogues..at least if their fight goes bad they got a way out (evade). My prognosis, verant is thinking of doing away with warriors..and if hes not, hes doing a good job of having all the high lvl ones hang up thier swords from being all but forgotten by him.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like some of the warrior disciplines, and I have yet to be able to use any but the resistant and fearless, but come on, disciplines don't balance the game more. I'd be more happy with something that has a refresh timer of itself not shared with other disciplines that will save my life or that of a group member. Warrior need more versitility or more tanking capability. I don't like being a meat shield, I've been outdamaged by rangers, paladins, and nearly all other classes, and I do have a Lamentation and Cane of the Tranquil. Don't give us more disciplines that take an hour to be reused, give a new skill hotkey with like 5, 10, or even 30 minutes timers. Warriors are still needed for groups, and will always be, but I haven't been able to keep a mob taunted since my 30's and I CONSTANTLY hit the taunt hotkey. Something needs to be done or warriors will become less and less effective. Yes we are the base class which all other classes are based off of, but that doesn't mean we need to be passed up when it comes time to buff the other classes. Casters, can straight up nuke a warrior to death with only a few spells, while I don't believe they need to be nerfed, I do think warriors need a bit of a buff. Hybrids can cast and tank (though not quite as well as a warrior). We are getting phased out here, all we can rely on is our skills, HP, and Equipment. Most other classes have much more, versitility for that, feign death, lay hands, root, snare, etc etc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with fix about the armor.  Having gone to Hate extensively and been in KC way too much the drops for warrior armor are ridiculously rare.  And really the helm and bracer, on Bertox at least, are trade only because they are so utterly, stupidly rare.  I have killed 50 or more Drolvarg Captains in KC and gotten nothing but mantles.  I hear about guants dropping but of course its when I'm not there hehe P.  And boots?  I swear in 2 months in KC I've heard of one, ONE, pair of Cobalt boots drop.  <P>If we are so dependant on our equipment it should not be as rare as it is.  And that cranks the prices up and warriors are one of the least money making classes so it just goes in a viscious circle.  Very very frustrated right now.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's a little snippet of how well our taunt does NOT work. In Lguk killin the lord with full group. I'm smackin the crap outta the Lord. Cleric stands up and complete heals me. Lord goes nuts on the cleric. Taunting every time it comes up, and laying into the lord I cant taunt him off. The SK and Pally in the group are doing this aswell. Nothin..he kills the cleric then lays into me. Thats BS!! Whats a tanks purpose if not to taunt off mobs? I hit Mr Frog for over 1000hps after the cleric healed me and he didnt flinch. <BR>Make taunt WORK please.<P>Heres my idea of a cool Skill: <BR>Killing Blow- Like an SK's HT can be done once per day or whatever but should do major damage. Could even have a cool graphic like a spinning slash or something. We just need something that can save our butts when we're about to die and a 1000+dmg attack would be nice. Might be a nice taunt too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>~CHUBBIE~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a question:  if you have SKs and Pallys who can taunt better than warriors using spells and who have the same offensive skills as warriors but just marginally lower AC and HPs, why do you even need a warrior in a group?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>===A soft AC CAP is GOOD"===<P>did anybody here think about this concept before they jumped on the anti-cap bandwagon. did you know what you were asking for?<P>i'm assuming that a cap exists for the purposes of this post, but in reality nobody knows how ac works, you don't, i don't, lots of people at verant probably don't. so, lets start off with a few basic things<P>warrior skills work more effectively than a hybrids, just go fight alongside an equally skilled paladin with similar equipment, you're meleeing will be far superior to theirs, tanking and damage wise.<BR>Would it be so radical to apply this concept to AC? maybe a warrior with 1.1k is better than a paladin with 1.1k if you ignore the skill issues.<BR>Now if this were true, than it would ensure us as the best tanks, a paladin now matter how well equiped, could never beat a warrior wearing indicolite with a few cobalt. <P>Monsters are all assuming that 1.1k is the max too, so even the ultrasuperuber mob is made with this in mind. meaning you have a lot more freedom to set up your equipment with stats and resists rather than a quest for the greatest ac. were said cap removed you'ld never be able to relax in your equipment gathering, all mobs would be retooled with the highest achievable ac of a warrior in the best gear in mind, which is preatty darn rare i'll wager.<P>so what does ac cap do in essence? help warriors and hurt everybody else...<P>-----<P>hybrids getting skill caps that are the same as us isn't something to worry about either, as i pointed out earlier, our skills do more...<P>will people quit whining about the hard time healers have with our current hp totals, i mean really. druid and shaman aren't main healers and clerics have cheal, whats the big deal? <P>i wish people would quit throwing around a few hundred hps like its nothing. "oh but a big velious mob knocks them off in two hits" and? are you saying you would rather be dead two hits sooner? if things turn south you'll want those extra two hits so your cleric can get off a cheal and your evaccer can get you all outta there rather than having to spend some time doing a cr<BR>extra hps is never anything to scoff at when its in the hundreds.<P>--------<P>For warriors, skills are the king, ac is queen, and hps are probably the jester. and if nothing else our king beats the heck out of every other class while they're busy playing around with our ac and laughing at our hps.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000458&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000458&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
