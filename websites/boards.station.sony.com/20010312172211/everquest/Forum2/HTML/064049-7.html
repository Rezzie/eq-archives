</FONT><HR>First off, I have quit EQ.  I still come back to the boards every now and then, just to see if anything is changing. I'm surprised at how many ppl feel just like I did.<P>Psyrin - Nice post  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;Please, from now on, simply reply to all threads from your paying customers with these words, it will make it easier for all of us...<BR>&gt;Your In Our World Now!<P>That was reason number two that I quit "Your In Our World Now!".  Yup, that is for sure.  I got so tired of being slaped in the face with that.<P>haren - Ahh, another nice post.<P>&gt;As for the ever present lack of fun in the game Who really wants to camp an area for up to 20 hours to get an item<P>Nope, sure don't want to camp anything for more than a few minutes.  Maybe an hour tops (if it's really really good).  Worst of all, I feel really bad when someone comes up and says "Are you camping &lt;some mob&gt;?".  That makes me feel bad cause I have to either give up the spawn or tell them nicely to take a hike).  It also ruins any realism and shatters the illusion of being in a mystical world.  <P>So, primary reason I quit - as haren stated, "ever present lack of run in the game".<P>Grave_Robber - Nice post also.<BR>&gt;While reading Absors response I did sense some sort of passive aggressive aura to the whole thing. <BR>LOL, me too.<P>Actually pretty much all of Absors post give me that feeling.  This is where I'm start realizing again, that my post (and everyone else's) is just a waste of time.<P>Some ppl can't learn from there mistakes.  So, I'm going to cut his short cause I don't expect any decision makers at VI to learn anything from my post or anyone else's.<P>The fact is this game has gone rapidly down hill from the first day I started playing (about a year ago).  EQ is a beautiful game, but it's cosmetic.  It has a variety of classes, races, and abilities (spells, etc..)  These are the things that sucked me in.  <P>Things that made me quit.  Fifty people in the same dungeon.  Hundred people in the same zone.  Swarms of weak monsters magically appearing all around me when I just killed them a few minutes ago.  Having to fight for my right at a camp. No good loot without camping.  No treasure chests. No traps for the most part.  A dungeon is basically an outdoors zone with walls.<P>Playing for hours just to see a blue line move a little.  Getting killed while trying to<BR>do something new and exciting (like explore a new area or fight in a dungeon).<P>No realism!<P>So, to the point - <BR>I'm not in "Your World" anymore!<P>hahahahahahahahahaha<P>PS  Just about every post here has been good and interesting.  Glad to see so many intelligent posts on the same thread.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After reading both the original post and absor's comments, I have a few things to say.<P>The original poster was dead on about alot of the issues. To you, verant, it IS work and it does seem like you are satisfying our needs. But I point out to you a comment he has made. Just about every time you guys come out with a tuning, fix, or improvement, there has been complaints made by the player community.<P>It is very true you can't satisfy everyone. But if the general outcry is against what you have done, can you still honestly say that you've satisfied at least HALF the players? <P>I know it is a tough job to develop and maintain a game as complex as this. This game has the current competition beat so far. It is a great game, it is the fact that you guys are still listening that I still play this game. I know that as a customer in "Your world" All I can hope for is that the servers continue to be up for me to play. However, I read your statement that you have developers playing the game, and that they play it all the time and know the issues. This disturbs me. The original poster stated 14 new people to advocate for the 14 classes. This serves two purposes. To determine what the customer wants, and be unbiased because they play another class. Your developers on your team do not have this. They are biased towards their class no matter what happens. Simply put, you and your developers ARE biased. This has been reflected by both your priority of changes in the game AND the way you respond to bugs. Several bugs in several classes HAVE been there since beta. They have only recently been fixed. If you had developers who did play those classes, you would have found them on day two. <P>You laughed and criticized the original poster for not really seeing how the customer base is and how they will react. The truth is he is right. One out of every EQ player IS a second account of someones. They either absorbed or brought a new account. I myself own two accounts that were legally brought and maintained. When you lose me as a customer, you will lose both of those accounts. <P>How kind of you to say that there are some people who have already decided to leave EQ and some people who will stay no matter what. <P>People are not that predictable. If I am happy with something there is a very small chance I will ever stop doing it. This goes for EQ. If I am happy with the game, no matter what other game comes along, I will still play. This was true when Asheron's call came out. This was also true when EQ came out, I quit UO because they did not give me what I wanted. I see the comments made by the original poster as very valid and very realistic. <P>Your comments absor, are very contrite, very defensive. It is true this is your job. This is your baby so to speak. You have every right to defend your methods. However, when you do see that  your methods are NOT working, I hope you can start listening to your customers.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I guess I agreed with most of what Alan said only I thought this part was utter crap:<P>"&gt;"Each class should have an interactive page on the EQ website through which to see a regularly updated status on their issues."&lt;<P>I would argue that there aren't so many 'issues' as you seem to think. To keep up the kind of interaction you seem to want would be a full-time job."<P>There are probably THOUSANDS of issues that haven't been dealt with and saying that there 'aren't so many' is ignorant and insulting to players intelligence. Also, if there aren't so many issues then why in the next sentence would you say that keeping us informed of them is a full time job? Creating a web page that lists outstanding issues is an excellent idea and very simple to do on a web page. It doesn't matter though because Casters Realm has already done this for you. P Too bad a third party can give the players what they want but verant can't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm sorry but the letter posted by EuroEQ is junk.  I'm going to have to support Verant's response on this.  Advocates?  And you say this is "just a game?"  None of you are looking at the broader picture - only interested in "balancing" your favorite class.  Face it, advocates or not, not everyone is going to be happy and what Verant has done so far is remarkable.  If you don't think so, why are you still playing this game?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just would like to say that I believe EuroEQ had some great points in his letter.  And I also believe, as I expected, the Verant people skipped right over most of the good points and went right for what they thought they could pick apart.  Funny how not one of the glaring examples regarding Necro's were mentioned.  And I didn't see them as necro-class-griping, but just good examples of what the poster was talking about.  Funny, had these examples not been included, the V response would have included criticism of how it was too general or lacking specific examples. *grin*<P>Anyway, it is very disappointing to watch what is happening and what is about to happen to this game.  The undercurrent of discontent that most every observant player witnesses on a daily basis is totally uncomprehended by V, because they think they know better.  But there is a long list of once-great companies who thought they knew better who are no longer in business or are not what they once were.  <P>P'raps the Emporer will notice his attire one day?  Who can know.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why is it then that every fix seem to be a improvement for druids? Why does it seem like bugs never get fixed while "new" content gets put in, causing MORE bugs? Why is it that all the ISSUES of a certain selective class are always the "burning" issues as if those classes are the only important classes in EQ? Do you see a trend?

</FONT><HR>But you don't seem like an advocate to all classes. You oppose things that some people have had in the beginning and almost no one complained about (ie enchanters being able to illusion into skeletons and wolf. *gasps* so horrible, illusioning into a race is ok, but into looking what one class could sometimes look like is unthinkable).<BR>As for agnostic enchanters versus religious you said before it was ok because people should live with the disadvantages choising a god. You don't address for an enchanter there is relatively NO advantage to picking a god, only penalty. The fact that most enchanters now go agnostic just shows it is common knowledge amoung the player base while the dev team has only started awknowledging it though done nothing about it.<BR>Until then enchanters won't even be balanced internally nevermind with every other class. Classes will never be totally balanced. It's just not humanly possible and I'm bothered by the fact the Dev team is aiming for a point where they will tell us they won't do anything more. You won't make the players happy with that stance. Even if enchanters are happy someone else will likely be left out in the cold or we'll still have super powered necros (and I know, I play a one) or some other class. Balance just isn't going to happen, and I'm bothered by the Dev team wanting to reach a arbitrary point where they'll tell the players to bugger off. It's even questionable if the races are balanced, how are you going to balance classes that are always changing too. Going to stop changing the game then?<P>To sum up, you've shown yourself not to be an advocate for some things that have been in since Beta and no one complains about, and you aim for a point that will never happen because it's impossible to really balance the classes and shutting out players after you decide they are 'balanced' will piss people off. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to admit, that i suspect the same, Advisor. Well however, Absor himself stated that he started with the Druid class talk, because he talked in the coffee break with another Verant employee who is playing a Druid and this Employee surerly told Absor something.<P>There were soo many bugs, not minor bugs, MAJOR bugs for weeks, months in the game. The players pleased verant to have a look at it, nothing happened. then misinfotmation ('All is ok, all is implemented, all is working as intended') was spread over the boards by verant. Customers continued to open Verant eyes... nothing happened untill there was the point of no return.<P>This is bad CS, it is a kind of 'prostitution'.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I just lost a piece of respect for you.<P>He wrote an open, honest, non-flamatory, non-antagonistic letter to you.  He communicated in a sincere and personal manner.  His thoughts were organised, clear, and very well presented.<P>Your response leaves much to be desired.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>--quote---<BR>Fair enough. I'll accept that there are customers (and not just customers of Verant, but just customers in general) that will be satisfied with very little customer service. I will also concede that there are a group of players that have already reached the end of their time with our game and will move on when a suitable alternative comes along. But I would argue that their reactions have little to do with customer service, and everything to do with the kind of customers they are (neither good nor bad, just their nature). Some people will move on to the next best thing regardless of what we do, and others have played themselves out on EverQuest. We do our best to retain these people, obviously. <BR>---end quote---<P>Some players will jump ship for the next big game regardless.  However, I think you're discounting a few things.  There are many players, myself included, who are going to jump ship *because* of the way Verant seems to handle things.  Your response here is a very recent example.<P>If the game is still enjoyable to play, and if I believe I'm dealing with people who actually understand and care about my concerns as a *player*, I'm going to stay longer in the Everquest world.<P>Where we stand now, where I'm not convinced the concerns of the 'EQ Team' are the same as mine, and where communication is as forthcoming as honesty from a politican ... it makes me long for Dark Ages of Camelot or Shadowbane to hurry up and go live so I can check them out.<P>---quote---<BR>So you are suggesting that we add another duty to each member of the dev team that they read all the class sites and become experts in the play of a certain class (which, it seems, would also require that they play that class up to 60th level on a live server)? They already do that. Every one of us plays the game. Members of the dev team play as many hours as anyone. And to insist that they spend their work time becoming activists for a certain class is rather silly. I think they should be developing content myself. <BR>---end quote---<P>Your reaction to his very reasonable proposal is outrageous.  You call him silly, you call his idea silly.  You indicate the request is already being fulfilled.<P>Players do not believe this.<P>Perhaps the Dev team does play the game.  But do they play the same game as us?<P>I'm not saying they only use GM created characters, not thinking that at all.  But do the Dev team members *truly* play the same Everquest as the rest of us?<P>A member of the Dev team has access to inside information about the game most hard core players would kill to have.  Any compentent gamer who's on the Dev team has enough data at his or her fingertips to play Everquest very excellently, without silly mistakes or mishaps that plague most of the rest of the player base at least occasionally.<P>As such, I, and many of my fellow players, *strongly* suspect the Dev Team plays at a rather high and exclusive level of the game.  I am not alleging they did not level characters up or gain their gear in-game; but it's easier to play the game successfully (defined as leveling up and obtaining gear necessary to be effective in top encounters) when you programmed the game, or sit next to the guy who did.  Arguing otherwise is patent fallacy.<P>That the Dev Team plays Everquest is a good thing.  That the Dev Team's "as many hours as anyone" most likely occur in elite game situations is of no help to the rest of the player base.<P>Do Dev Team members log in as Paladins or Shadow Knights in Karnor's or Sebilis and wait for an hour and a half for a group to stoop to hiring them for a spot?<P>Do Dev Team members find themselves stuck in guilds without the means and firepower to successfully even make it to high level Kunark and Velious encounters?<P>Do Dev Team members find themselves twiddling their caster thumbs when they engage in recent elite encounters that reduce robe wearing classes to extra lag and nothing more?<P>I don't dispute the Dev Team plays the game.  But if they play in Elite Guilds at an Elite Level, they're not playing the same game as the rest of us.  Everquest is really several different games.  The game that Fires of Heaven, Afterlife, LoS, and any other uber guild one might care to name is worlds apart from the game experience of the majority of the playerbase.<P>The average player, willing to learn and do the things required to have a chance at elite encounters, will never see them.  These players will never see them because of many issues, the least of which are issues of organization and guild firepower; the 'uber' guilds are uber primarily because they have elite coordination and players dedicated to playing with excellence.  That's a very commendable thing, one I know more than a few players wishes they could be apart of.  But it's not going to happen for  most players, and we all know it.  Because many many players play Everquest 'like a game' (that is to say, very casually, without looking up stats or reading/thinking about tactics and strategy, and/or only in small time segments less than the six+ hours needed to make meaningful headway in most elite zones), and thus are impediments to achieving at the highest levels.<P>Thus, the experiences of those fortunate enough to find themselves in that enviable position do not translate to the 'masses'.<P>That you give no indication of this seemingly simple concept discourages me greatly.<P>---quote---<BR>I've spent a lot of time lately getting to know the desires of the players that identify themselves with a particular class. I've written up those desires, purposefully excluding the ones that did not take into account the good of the game. And yet, as is obvious by your post, I am not considered an 'advocate' for any of them. Why is that? I have done as you have described. I have listened to the players, responded to them (over a longer period of time than I would have if I was only dealing with one class), and listed their concerns. I have been an 'advocate' as you described. <P>And yet, you clearly do not see me as such. <P>*shrug* <BR>---end quote---<P>I do not consider you an advocate because of the opinions and views you have expressed, especially during the class talks.  You admit freely you play only a few classes, and tend to favor certain of them over others.<P>This is fine.  We all have preferences and choices we've made.  No one is saying you have to master all fourteen classes, certainly not me.  That you lean in certain directions and haven't explored others is completely ok; I haven't tried out all fourteen classes, and I certainly haven't leveled all fourteen up to planar raid levels either.<P>But repeatedly during the class talks a suggestion would be made, or a problem detailed, and you would respond with "well, I disagree that it's a problem; I think &lt;x&gt; should work like that".<P>Nothing says players are always right.  Nothing says players aren't, on average, at least a little biased.  Nothing says players wouldn't, were their every wish always fulfilled, end up in a 'Monty Haul' type of game with upwardly spiralling powerlevels.<P>But to dismiss out of hand numerous suggestions being made by significant percentages of class populations ... it strikes me as anything *but* objective and balanced.<P>I agree with the original poster; we could certainly stand some regularly assigned people to certain classes.  People who we could come to trust as experts in that area of the game, people we know have played those classes across the level ranges, high and low, elite and common.  People we know have experienced the same issues as the rest of us.<P>It would give me much more trust in Verant's actions as a player if I knew my concerns as a player were being relayed between players and Dev Team by someone who *understands* my concerns.<P>Someone whose only active characters are all 50+, who only play in elite situations, in elite guilds, with other elite players ... those are commendable things.  They're certainly a lot of fun for that person.<P>But there's no way someone who's spent the last year only logging into 55+ characters that go every day or two to zones like Veshan's Peak, Velkor's Labratory, Plane of Growth, etc... can relate to the concerns 'average' players have.  If you only play in elite situations, it's not your fault you lose track of issues important to players who only read about elite situations.  The circumstances surrounding a member of an elite guild are completely different from those the average player finds themselve in.<P>And I doubt many of your players *believe* a Dev Team member who has no active characters below 50, who isn't guildless and lacking in high powered game friends who can join in high level raids, understands their concerns either.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i am now weary of reading these posts...looking for a reasonable response from vi. do some of you feel the same way?<P>Not to bore Alan with credibility, but I have worked in the games dev business for years, as quality assurance, writing, design, programming, and originally as customer service/technical support, so perhaps the following statement will have the strength to pierce this VI shroud of perpetual denial:<P>Your support sucks.<P>That was the origin of this thread, and now it is a monster that only be put down with attention. If you kill this thread you will prove it. If you ignore it, you will prove it. The only thing you can do now is address it or hire some people to flame it to death so you can wimper out of the room.<P>I could understand this situation if vi was a small dev shop with 10 guys. I was one of three active online support reps for a such a group, even then we had three guys active online all the time. Even then we understood that loyalty in gaming software is hard earned.<P>The request for 14 reps, one for each class is NOT unreasonable given the size of this product. You have 300K rabid addicted fans. Ok, not all are addicted, and not all are rabid, but if you can't find 14...well never mind it is too much work. Please don't even try.<P>The nit-picking about the EULA was pathetic. It makes Alan look desperate, not thorough. It reminds us all that vi has no concept of what paying customers really do with this product. Which is surprising, since Alan MUST constantly remind us that the dev team plays this game and has played all classes and at all levels. whatever. Maybe you forget a key word here: developer. They code. THey can't be playing if they are coding. We play. Get it? It reminds me of a ridiculous post I read many months ago about how "pulling" mobs was not really part of the vision. <P>Anyway, I don't have hours to devote to this topic, and I won't allocate them because vi won't take it seriously anyway, so let me just throw a line out to my brothers and sisters who both love and are addicted to this game: your intentions are noble (most), but you are holding onto something tighter than its creators. Your dream here is nothing more than a strategic point on vi's long-term business plan..you characters are stepping stones to greater moolah. As the players, we make the experience, we make the game and I for one am tired of prostrating myself before the deaf gods of this world. You can bet that when the next one is ready I will be there instead..and as this thread proves - I won't be alone.<P>later<BR>kellian<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"You're in Our World Now" TM.  I saw an excellent departure letter awhile back.  They argued that the moment this persistent world MMORPG was opened to the public, it ceased to be "verant's world".  It's "Our World".  The players are what really make the world what it is.  The problem, Verant, is that many of your customers feel that you do what you want when you want without enough consideration for them.  A slogan that's intended to convey the feeling of an immersive world takes on a different meaning.  People see it as developers taking an attitude toward players of "Oh, you don't like it? Too bad, You're in Our World Now, so :P".  Heck, most of the time I see that slogan it's as a cynical response from one player to another as they're trying to figure out the latest illogical coding fix or bizarre bug that got them killed or the latest nasty nerf.  The company attitude should be that the World first and foremost belongs to those who "live" in it.  Put their concerns first.  Don't punish them for their successes.  Don't get so attached to your uber-mobs that if a guild (like FoH) manages to take them down sooner than expected, you feel the need to nerf something.  Sure, items/spells recently introduced that are blatantly overpowered should be looked at, but don't become overzealous with it.  Ease up on players and let them have fun instead of being perceived as an evil dictator/rules lawyer (example: the draconian EULA).<P>Trust the players to know what's fun for them. The perception has been that Verant thinks they know what's fun for you the customer, no matter what you think, so just accept it.  "What?  It's just frustrating, not fun?  No, you're wrong.  It's fun.  You just haven't realized it yet." Sure there are some powergamers out there who love things to be easy for them (ie. munchkins in table top RPGs), but there are many, many players who love a challenge.  If you're trying to add challenge, listen to them.  When encounters were already very difficult for most people and then you nerfed the healing taunt in the name of challenge, causing innumerable additional deaths among healers, people understandably got very upset.  The game is NOT more fun because of nerfs like that one.  It's simply more frustrating.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Honestly folks, what was the last game you played that allowed YOU a voice in game design/mechanics decisions. I can't think of ONE, unless you get in on beta.<P>As far as the constantly balancing thing goes, I say they shoulda just stopped months ago and damn the complaints. EVERY other game i've ever played there have been exploitable bugs, balance issues and quirky behavior from the AI. Yet you people seem convinced you have the right to bludgeon the designers/programmers/customer relations people because of some microscopic facet of the game the you were fond of is altered or they won't give you this or that ability/item that your class is broken without.<P>How easy do you think it is to balance 14 classes including all they're spells, items, and tactics (solo and group)? Add to that AI (which has always been quirky/predictable/cheating in most every game ever made), mob abilities, and 1000 other little things. EQ is HUGE. If you wanted them to release it balanced, you'd never have played the thing. It's impossible.<P>And this is VI's world, not ours. No way I'd pay $10/month to play something one of the legion of whiners would turn this game into. Good luck pushing the next gaming company around like you have VI. If it were me I wouldn't respond to any of you at all.

IMHO<P>On another note you mentioned that the developers are avid players and know all the concerns of the game. Maybe they only know the concerns about the characters they play? As I dont see all the developers running around playing rangers unless they are blatant masochist.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Also I bet they play under ideal circumstances with well known groups/guilded and can push the limits of the perfect team/raid.<P>So in fact how do customers know that some characters/situations aren't being pushed aside because they have no advocate or person that can see their point of view?? Seems if I was a developer for my own favorite game I would in fact make sure that my character wouldn't be "nerfed" to the point of being unplayable in the upper game, and when an opportunity came to fix them they get the shaft all the more so.

</FONT><HR>You know, Verant is damned if they do, damned if they don't.  Before Absor and Abashi, there wasn't nearly as much complaining going on around the boards.  Why?  Because there wasn't one named person that was supposed to be dedicated to listening to you, the customer.  Sure, people posted problems and suggestions, but the volume went way up once people knew there was somebody reading every post.  So Verant makes an effort to listen to you, and then you complain that they're not listening.<P>Some of you people need to develop some sort of patience.  I work for a division of a large company and we bring in multiple millions of dollar in revenue a month, heck, our customer penalty contracts (for not meeting customer expectations) are more than what Verant makes from  this customer base per month.  Our customers are very demanding, but nowhere near as demanding as many of you.  You (I'm talking about some of you customers) don't understand a lick of what it takes to make a large software project succeed.  Absor is trying to explain the magnitude of schedules and priorization of work on the team, but you guys just don't listen or understand.<P>Re-read what he wrote and try to understand it.

</FONT><HR>After two years of playing EQ, I really think that class-based MMORPGs are not for me. It gives too much power to the game developers and generally leaves the players contantly feeling nerfed or cheated over time. <P>In a class-based system the only abilities given to the players come from the "immortals" through skills, spells or items. You cannot transform your toon outside of the strict definition of the class set by the devs. This leads to contant nerfs, rebalancing, class envy, and general GM bitterness toward the players and player bitterness toward te GMs.<P>If someone interested in EQ perused these boards why would they ever want to play?<P>Skill-based RPGs give more control to the player who does not have a class per se but a collection of skills. Obviously if a skill allowed a level 1 to kill the top boss mob in the game, it would be unbalanced and nerfed, but in general the devs can adjust balance through content rather than directly changing the players' characters. This is a much more subtle approach, and it allows allows players modify their characters by training newly important skills if they have the credits to do so. <P>IMO, this leads to a much more civil atmosphere in general and is more challanging to the players. Asheron's Call is a skill based game, and if you look at the two games' message boards, the difference is like night and day. The AC boards have nowhere near the animosity seen on the EQ boards. <P>This is not meant to be a plug for AC or a rant against EQ, but rather an observation I have made after looking at both message boards and thinking about the design differences of the two games. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Do any of you both to read Absor's posts???  He has said many times in the class talk threads (once in just about every one of them) that he is taking &lt;X&gt; ideas/concerns to the development team, even ones that *he* disagrees with.<P>How long do you think the development team needs to spend on each class, going through *every* change proposed by *every* poster??  A week?  A month?  And how does this impact all the concerns about quests, MoBs, raids, etc.?  The simple fact is that just adding more and more people to the team (assuming they had the money to do so) is NOT going to increase quality.  It would simply dilute the ability of the team to do any ONE thing right.  I have been in working groups before that have gotten too large, and inevitably things start to fall apart to the point that the *team* cannot get anything useful done.<P>Absor was entirely correct.  Posting timelines WOULD be counterproductive.  Let's say that they are working on each class in turn, with plans to further tune things after all the changes are made...Now, let's say that necromancers are the last ones on their list of classes to do and warriors are second to last.  Those classes would IMMEDIATELY start complaining that they have issues that need addressing NOW and start another dozen (and more) threads each going over once AGAIN all the things about their class that needs to be fixed, further diluting the ability of Absor (or anyone else) to pay attention to other issues that are of more immediate concern to even more players.<P>Some of you have compared this game to a long beta-testing program in the past.  Yet, many (many) people have reached the highest levels of 55-60.  Many (most?) of the highest level MoBs HAVE been killed and their bodies looted to the delight of those who did the deed.  YET, every single class says that there is something fundamentally wrong with their class and they want it fixed NOW.  Regardless of how static the game ends up being after a change, the fact remains that changes have been made (Kunark and Velious being the easiest to point to), and those changes will always have results that can't be foreseen by the most brilliant of programmers and developers, and those results can't be "fixed" instantaneously.<P>My mom taught me that patience was a virtue.  She also taught me a corollary that a *little* patience goes a *long* way.  Have some of it.  If even a quarter of the changes that Absor has already said are being taken to the development team are implemented within the next two months, there will be a HUGE benefit to the players, both in terms of playability and REplayability.  Diluting the *team* that does the work on the current LIVE version of Everquest by telling 14 of them they now have to think about 14 individual classes instead of thinking about the game as a whole is not necessarily a brilliant idea; in fact, it could have the effect (even if it worked perfectly) of adding even more time to the wait we have ahead of us in terms of changes to each class.<P>Was EuroEQ's post well written?  Absolutely.  In theory, were his ideas good ones?  Sure thing.  However, that does not mean that the ideas were *right*.  I know people who could sit and write a well-thought-out and convincing treatise about why homosexuals should not be allowed to marry or serve in the military.  That doesn't mean that they would be RIGHT.<P>Further, those of you who thought that Absor was being dismissive in his post are right.  That doesn't change the fact that he likely *thought* about the post before disagreeing, it's just that he did disagree.  This is a symptom of what is wrong with so many people who post here: "If you disagree with me, then you either didn't understand me or don't care about my opinion."<P>Patience is a good thing.  So is perspective.  My suggestion is to get some of both before you post your reactions to things that Absor, or anyone else, writes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Heh.  Personally I hope that Absor's response is genuine.  It'll make quite an impression when someone does come along that listens to customer input and responds in a timely manner (acknowledging read responses with some sort of flag) and Verant goes belly up wondering what went wrong.  I've seen this happen a few times in other avenues and it's always been a source of amusement for me (call it my twisted sense of justice) to watch something like this happen.  You ignore the pleas of your customers for better service, then you listen when your customer base is threatened, but by then it's too late.  Ah, well.  Can't blame us for trying to fix the situation.<P>*shrug back at ya, Alan*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>EuroEQ - I applaud your effort. Woot!<P>To EuroEQ's detractor's: <P>You miss the point. The problem is POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. He just gave some suggestions on a fix not an ultimate solution.<P>I agree that Verant Customer Service is poor at best. Verant has a great product. EQ is something that has given me a lot pleasure playing but the 2 times I have had to interact with Verant's Customer Service, the service is non-existant or poor.<P>Currently, I am waiting to speak to a GM for 16 HOURS RealLife on a petition. Usually I play for 4 hours at a time so this has been around for 4 DAYS. I have not been contacted yet. Is this good Customer Service(CS)? I was told by a GM on the chat portion of EQ that this could only be handled in game. I agree with that but he should poke his head into the GM area for VallonZek and say see me in game he has been waiting a long time. It is this lack of response and follow up that is a hallmark of Bad CS. This will drive people to abandon EQ and Verant when the next big MMORPG comes along such as Anarchy Online, Shadowbane, etc.<P>Please fix your CS. We do not hate you or your product. <P>Perception is Reality in the Business World and the perception is that your CS is very bad at best.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Coming in on the side Euro. Speaking as CS agent in real life, he's dead on target with his comments.<P>I'm not going to rebut Absor's counter-points. He's towed the party line quite admirably--a worthy apprentice and successor to Abashi. I'll just give an overall impression:<P>Denial. Stonewalling. Misdirection. Smoke-screening. Defensive and Offensive.<P>These are my impressions of Absor's response. Frankly, I'm quite astonished. I'm one of Absor's few remaining supporters---or was. I almost suspect it wasn't he who responded. Unfortunately, the writing style belies this suspicion.<P>Any company who truly wants my business, will never respond to me or another customer in my 'hearing' like this. Ever.<P>My question is: where is Sony in all this?

</FONT><HR>Just an idea... maybe it would help with things like the class discussion threads if Absor would cut down on how often he makes his opinion known about a given concern.  When scores of people complain about an alleged problem with their class and Absor says something like, "I'll take it to the development team, but I don't think it's a problem", people figure it's all but been shot down already.  It sounds like the concern will be delivered to the development team with a format like this:  "The players say that X is a problem  so I'm reporting it, but personally I think they're full of it."  Now maybe that's NOT how things get presented to the dev team.  People get that impression though. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sigh. Absor until you take your head out of the clouds and realise you are NOT doing anything close to the job of 14 people then we will forever have these issues.<P>You do a good job, probably as well as can be expected (although personally I think you should have more in-depth knowledge of certian areas...). What you do not do is the job many of the playerbase think you do.<P>Funny thing is we think you are the liason between 'us' (the playerbase) and Verant. Clearly you are not, you are the PR guy that tries to get across 'the Vision' to the playerbase. Worse still of late you have simply become the bearer of bad news as stuff gets nerrfed.<P>If you cannot see the recent Class Talk threads have been a dismal failure (at least for non-druids) then you are deluded. I play a necromancer, one of the more vocal classes. Heck we even had a Necro on Raids thread before our Class Talk thread. However the result of in excess of 1000 posts to these threads have resulted in a pathetic partial list that doesn't even address necro core concerns.<P>The problem is not that you really don't care or that you just created the Class Talk threads as a PR gimmick (I hope not anyway) but that you absolutely HAVE to play a necromancer to understand our concerns. If you don't play a necromancer (a lvl 60 one at that otherwise higher level player's concerns will not be properly addressed) then you either make the list up of ALL necro ideas/concerns or you have someone assigned to you that does play a lvl 60 necro to filter the list for you. What actually has happened is that you have filtered the list yourself with no understanding of the class on which to base your descisions.<P>Let me make this clear to you: The Necro Class Talk thread has been a hopeless failure, the 'list' is woefully inadequate and does not reflect the majority of views posted here by experienced necros. With this in mind is it not obvious why necro's are so frustrated at their class talk discussions (and presumably why a dozen other classes are similarly disappointed in their respective threads).<P>I guess what I'm saying is sometimes doing a partial job is no better than not doing anything.<P>Whilst I don't believe class advocates are the way to go (as you rightly point out they will be counter-productive) you absolutely do need people permantently assigned to you as deputies. Some of which have specialist knowledge in certain areas (tuning, certain classes, quests etc). But mostly just to spread your workload. Do you honestly think you can do a good job of maintaining 14 class thread lists? Let me tell you this, you cannot and nobody could!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
