&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off, great job on the smithing update.  This is a lot more widespread than I ever imagined.  However, as with every new product, there are going to be areas that need a bit of fine tuning.  Here's my take on the Barbarian smithing stuff.<P>Weapons - Northman weapons are made with Medium Quality sheets or folded sheets of metal, appropriate molds, and water.  The gear turned out from these are pretty decent, for what you put into making them.<P>Imbued Weapons - Magical versions, usable by Tribunal followers, are made by adding Imbued Ivory to the mix, and replacing water with Frost Temper.  Only made the mace so far, but again, pretty decent for what it takes.<P>Northman Ring Mail - This one puzzled me, but I finally got it figured out, and made some. (Thread up on the Shamans Crucible at http://eqforge.com/forums/Forum16/HTML/008975.html about it.)<P>Imbued Northman Ringmail can be made by the addition of Imbued Ivory to the mix, no other changes, and adds (to tunic) +1 Str, +2 Wis, +2 vs Cold.  Nice stuff, but only for Tribunal followers.<P>This is where I see a problem - Northman Ringmail takes MQ Rings, Smithy Hammer, Large Leather armor, Large Chainmail pattern, and Frost Temper.  All for armor that is a little better than bronze (Banded tunic - AC 15, Wght 6.5; Bronze BP - AC 17, Wght 12.5; Northman Ring Tunic - AC 17, Wght 8.5).  Frost Tempers are brewed using one Brandy (bought at bar), one Ice Goblin Blood (from Ice Goblins), and two Essence of Winter (from Ice Giants).  Essence of Winter seems to be a somewhat rare drop off the ice giants... was grouped there for about 3 hours the other night, and we only got 3.  With the seeming rarity, unless there are a lot more sources for it out there, I doubt if there will be a full suit of Northman Ringmail on any server - I know I won't make any; I'll be saving my Frost Tempers for making Imbued stuff.  If the regular Northman Ringmail took water or something more common than Frost Temper, it would be a good upgrade to banded, and even bronze.  Needing Frost Temper is just going to make it unused.<P>Couple of suggestions on this.<BR>  1)  Change the recipe for the Northman Ringmail to use something other than Frost Temper, water or even some other higher end brew, like Ol' Tujims.<BR>  2)  Change Frost Temper to require only one Essence of Winter, not two.<BR>  3)  Increase the drops of Essence of Winter - perhaps add to drop tables for other winter creatures, be they in Everfrost, Permafrost, that iceberg in the Timorous Deep, and the snow region of the Dreadlands.<P>Hope you read this and look into the situation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I agree completely with cush  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I too have tried to make the *very exciting* northman equipment (just made a imbued northman cloak, glad and proud  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<P>So here are my comments  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Northman weapons : Good. They are pretty decent, better than fine steel (the biggest gripe with forged weapons have always been the "killer" comparison with common dirt cheap fine steel), seems to be the same difficulty as banded (trivial and extremely easy at 175) and cost around 10-30 pp to make, depending on the weapon. And the mace looks awesome. Good job on balancing  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Imbued Northman weapon : Only one known this far, imbued mace is 9/36 magic range slot usable, WIS2 STR1 COLD2 tribunal only.<BR>Well the weapon in itself is not bad, a cold iron morning star with wis, excellent for a shaman in his twenties.<BR>But... the frost temper (see below). not worth the trouble.<P>Northman ringmail : could have been a great armor fir youg players, a step up banded if ... if ...<BR>frost temper (see below)<P>Imbued Northman Ringmail : Good. Very good armor for a shaman. Less AC than totemic, better WIS : this is a real alternative to totemic, a very desirable armor. This is worth the 7 hour perma/everfrost camp (I was unlucky apparently  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> ), the 3 hours tonight spend traveling, buying ivory, gathering components, the help of my brewer friend, and the great dedication of my guild and friends. This is what the cultural armor should be, not ovrpowering, but cool and useful. Kudos !<BR>As I have always refused to the alchemist in permafrost, I made, and wear proudly a northman cloak, at level 39. I am damn happy, proud of my achievment. For that joy, and the great surge of adrenaline when I did hit the combine button, I thank you Yakatizma, and Verant  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. But it will certainly be the only part I will make. i am not and will never be a camper...<P>To sum up ?<BR>The key here is the frost temper and the essence of winter. Rare drop of a static camp. I agree with Cush : I have no problem with the rarity, but make it drop in more zones (yetis in kunark ?). I agree that a barbarian wanting to make a full set of armor should spend a huge amount of time, no probleme with the rarity, but not killing the same spawn over over and over. How many giants to make a full set ? Just try to answer this question  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif"><BR>WISH : make essence of winter spawn on more mobs (same rarity) : yetis, named goblins, maybe velious  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>The rarity of the frost temper is fine for the very good imbued chainmail, but the imbued weapons, and, especially the regular ringmail, are grossly underpowered compared to the difficulty<BR>WISH : make the imbued weapons a little better. Remove the frost temper from the regular mail recipe. Requiring such a difficult component for a bronze level armor is harsh. The recipe (except the temper) is perhaps too cheap, so balance it with a store bought somewhat costly temper (30 pp ?). No problem with temper rarity for magical ringmail, onlu for regular.<P>And two last things.<BR>1) Northman mail looks like banded. VERY disappointing. The cultural equipment should be a mark of distinction and achievement for the blacksmith. There *needs* to be a visible difference, so that people can see you and say "wow, he is wearing the fabled armor of the north".<P>2)This armor is for barbarian shamans. We were promised that the cultural armor will be "cross-race". Considering that the northman regular non magical mail is useless compared to the difficulty, that only leave the imbued chainmail. And big shock : it's a quasi barbarian shaman only armor. What about barbarian agnostic or Zek followers ? What about rogues and warriors ? What about erudites and human ? and what about half elves, especially ? That, I feel a bit shocking and disappointing compared to what was hinted in your pre patch posts...<BR>WISH : remove the deity restriction<P>All in all, though i am complaining, I am very pleased, and I think the cultural stuff is great.<BR>I just gave my humble opinion and impression, as one of the very first barbarian great smiths  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> and maybe give feedback for Yaka to finely tune the trade skill. <P><BR>Kjeld, &lt;Les Princes de Sarnar&gt;, shaman of the 39th winters</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was also going to comment on the looks, but forgot.  As for part of what Feynor said:<P>2)This armor is for barbarian shamans. We were promised that the cultural armor will be "cross-race".<P>Well, it's right above, go read the rest.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  I don't really agree with this part.  Agnostics are going to be screwed on the magical armors, true.  But...  As a Shaman following the will of the Tribunal, I expect some extra protection.  A warrior dedicated to the Tribunal should also get that protection.  A warrior who does not do the will of the Tribunal should not expect help from the Tribunal.  As for those who follow Rallos Zek, a friend is in the process of trying to craft his items with an Imbued Jade he got from an Ogre Shaman of Rallos Zek.  Remember, McPherson says "imbued jade or ivory" on the weapons, which will probably carry over to the armor.  As for the races, there is a fairly decent spread for the Northman Ringmail, and even a bit for the Imbued Northman Ringmail.<P>-------------------------<BR>                    Northman Ring Mail (tunic)<BR>                    AC 17<BR>                    Weight 8.5<BR>                    WAR, CLR, PAL, RNG, SHD, BRD, ROG, SHM<BR>                    HUM, BAR, ERU, ELF, HIE, DEF, HEF, IKS<P>                    -------------------------<BR>                    Imbued Northman Ring Mail (tunic)<BR>                    The Tribunal<BR>                    AC 17<BR>                    STR +1, WIS +2, SV COLD +2<BR>                    Weight 8.5<BR>                    WAR, BRD, ROG, SHM<BR>                    HUM, BAR, HEF<P>Again, the only points I have problems with are 1) need for such a difficult to gain Temper for the non-Imbued armor, and 2) the looks.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kjeld:  <P>1)  I agree on the graphic thing.  It really is too bad all northman armour looks like banded.  Could this armour be given a different tint?  Or could the graphic be switched to the plate graphic with a different tint than the Totemic?  For plate I wouldn't mind red, or maybe brown (looked sharp in the pics I saw).  Or, on banded, a green about the color of the totemic armour might be nice.<P>2)  More drops on the essense of winter sounds good too.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>3) I think kinda I disagree about the race/diety thing.  (Although I may not completely understand it.)  Barbarian warriors who don't follow The Tribunal already have an Imbuded armour--made by humans in a Royal Forge and imbued by a cleric of THEIR faith.  Us shamans aren't suposed to make it 'cause that ain't our culture to make the plate that the tanks like, and we only imbue for The Tribunal anyway.  Clerics of other dieties can imbue with powers for that diety.  (I think we barb shaman imbue for Full (Field?) Plate for followers of The Tribunal, but a human has to forge it.)<P>Agnostics I think are SOL, for all races and classes, by design.<P>I'm not sure what cultural armour the Barbarian rogues who don't follow The Tribunal get, hmm, Yakatizma can you help me out here?<P>Remember that the northman mail *doesn't* have diety restrictions--I think that's intended to be our "cross-race" armour right there.  We were promised that some of the imbued (cultural) armour would be cross race *for those who couldn't make it themselves*.  I don't think all races were promised that they could *make* cross-race cultural armour, just that there would be somthing they could *wear*.  I know you may not like it but us barbs just can't make stuff that other races want (ie can wear).  'Dem's da breaks.<P>Anyway, if we can get the first two issues addressed, I'd be estatic.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks for all your great work on this upgrade Yak-man!<P>NCD</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Update:<P>Cush: Doh!  "As for those who follow Rallos Zek, a friend is in the process of trying to craft his items with an Imbued Jade he got from an Ogre Shaman of Rallos Zek. "  Of course.  Any barbarian can make cultural armour, if they have the skill and the imbued component.  Obviously those dispictable Rogues who don't acknowlege the Tribunal will have to get Imbued Jade and then slink into Halas to forge it themselves.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Exactly.  It wouldn't surprise me too much if we'd be able to make Imbued Northman Ringmail using ANY of the Imbued stones - although the race/class limits are going to be set.  Not sure if this is true, but that'd mean that our (and probably all other race versions of Imbued Ringmail) can be crafted for any Dieties worshippers.  Hmmm...  That IS something to research further.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Oh, the OTHER thing I wanted to question...  Ivory drops.  I haven't seen a complete list of the Imbe spells, but aside from the Druid Imbue Plains Pebble and Barbarian Shaman Imbue Ivory, every other stone can be bought in a store.  Not ours.  The Plains Pebble... eh.  I've got a 35 druid, and foraging is boring - but at least I can hit the key every minute or two.  Ivory, on the other hand, seems to be a mid level entry to the gems list on loot tables.  This is nice, because of how widespread the drops are, but until word gets out to hang onto these, we're screwed at the merchants.<P>Why?  If I sell a merchant a stack of 10 Ivory, then go buy them back, I can only buy ONE before he is out.  If I sell 10 Ivory, one at a time, then I can buy all 10.  How many people do that?  This bug on the merchants inability to count is drastically cutting back on the amount of ivory available...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Even better solution for the race/deity debate : make the non imbued version more desirable compared to the cost (rarity and difficulty of Essence of Winter). <P>A better (-&gt; more desirable) or easier to make (no frost temper -&gt; more available, marketable) non imbued ringmail will certainly please all our half elf, human and barbarian rogues, or warriors, and excellently fulfill the non-deity role of the cultural smithing, while providing an extra bonus for faithful tribunal followers ... <BR>As it stands now, the imbued ringmail is worth the trouble because of the WIS bonus only ...<P>The good example is the Indigo Sabre : the basic weapon is cool 7/24 non magical, great looks, the imbued weapon adds an extra bonus (+2 str +2 int magical) that will please the faithfull Teir'dal followers of innoruk.

</FONT><HR>Frost Temper needs 2 Essence of Winter.<BR>Sea Temper uses 2 Mugs of Sea Foam.<BR>Shadow Temper needs 2 Essence of Shadow.<P>Okay.  Here is info that I know or have read.  Essence of Shadow is supposed to drop from Shadowmen.  There are Shadowmen all over - SK, Nektulos, WC, Innothule, Lesser Fey. (might be a few more, but there are lots).  Sea Foam, I know from experience, drops from Seafury Cyclops in OoT.  Not sure how many cyclops' are on the island, but I have seen, on busy nights, at least half a dozen groups hunting.  Essence of Winter drops from Ice Giants.  There are 3 IG's in Everfrost, at the front of Permafrost.  There are also a couple (never hunted them, not sure on count) inside Permafrost, which are not hunted much, unless someone is doing a Vox raid.  So...  Barbarian smiths are going to be severally limited on Frost Tempers for the Imbued items, much less needing it for the Northman Chainmail.  This is why I'm asking for the drops of Essence of Winter to be looked at.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Tunic takes 3 MQ Metal Rings (same metal ring recipe, only use Northman Forge) - I was going to get one large brick of ore enchanted, and try to make Enchanted MQ metal rings out of it, but ran into that problem.<P>But anyway, the main focus of the thread is the use of Frost Temper for the non magical version, regular Northman Ringmail - although the drops of Essence of Winter is also important.  Would really like to see some uniqueness for the various armors, too, even if it's just light tinting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Everything about the ivory imbued northman ringmail is right on the money.<P>In terms of the work needed to get the reward, it is not really worth, but it is still nice, and definatly competition to the shaman quest armor.<P>Other race/class that may use it.<BR>HUM-BRD HEL-BRD BAR-WAR. Not sure how many tribunal followers there are, but in ane case, these are plate classes, and they have no use for the wis. The str, and lighter weight make it an alternative to bronze, but definatly not to class armor. <P>BAR-ROG. For all I know there are very few tribunal followers among rogues. Somehow 'Rogue' and 'Justice' do not got well together. For the few that can use it, it is a nice upgrade to banded, and alternative to missing Ravenscale pieces.<P>The conclution is that the Ivory imbued Northman Ringmail will be exclusively Barbarian shaman armor. I am not sure if that was the intention, but that is definatly how it is turning out.<P>Now comparing the non imbued. The only difference is the use of Ivory, and possibly the dificulty in making it. They way it looks the bottleneck will be the frost temper, so the dificulty of making imbued and non-imbued will be fairly small.<P>Non imbued Northman Chainmail is a good armor set for chain clases, ei rangers, rogues and shamans. Now the shamans are all tribunal, so we are left with rogues and rangers competing with shamans. Given the large advantage shamans will get from the wis bonus, I think very few pieces of non imbued will be made.<P>In addition to this seafarer ringmail seem to have the same properties, and sea tember a lot easier to get at, so that is probably a better alternative for rogues and rangers.<P>But it is still early, and we may see things differently when we haqve more facts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, and it happens already.  Little comparision shopping here.<P>After doing a bit of fishing in OoT, I get some no drop Saltwater Seaweed, and find out it's used for Sea Temper, for the Seafarer stuff.  So, I plan a little fishing trip... load up the cask with some Ol' Tujims, get about 60 grubs, and grab my pole.  Go to Sister Island and sit on the dock, fishing contentedly, listening to the inevitable crying and moaning from those going insane on the boat, and the taunting of those happily bashing away on the islands.  Spend a wee bit of time, and get me 7 Saltwater Seaweeds.  Then I ask the zone if anyone has any Mugs of Sea Foam?  Get a couple of replies "Sure, come to xxxx", and a several questions about it's use.  Swim over to get them, gate back to FP, and hit the nearest bar for the Fish Wine & Brew Barrel, and make 5 out of 7 Sea Tempers.  Total elapsed time, about 30 minutes.<P>Flash to tonight.  I'm back near Halas, and resolve to head out to the Ice Giants to try to get Essences of Winter.  Get out there, and there are 3 folks there - a human ranger I've gotten a couple from before, an ogre shaman, and a wood elf druid.  Looks great, no barbarian smiths there to beat me to it!  So I ask politely if they have any Essences they would part with, and the elf sends me a tell - she's collecting them, "for her shammy".  I ask if we could share, and get some request to make dyes for her, which I was willing to do - but, seems that I'd have to go get vials, etc, etc, and I don't have long before logging.  So, I guess for us Barbarian smiths, we can rush off to Mastersmith status, and then trudge along gaining xp, until we are able to get a group out at the 3 Ice Giant spawns and hope we can at least share in the pitiful amount of Essences, or badger our friends into coming out to the frozen wastes, with nothing to do if the giants are already camped, or trudge along the xp path even more, until we are able to solo the giants ourselves.<P>Hmmm.  This sound fair?  5 out of 7 Sea Tempers within a half hour, or a random for the one Essence of Winter that might drop in the same time?<P>The problem isn't the rarity of the drops.  Mugs of Sea Foam aren't exactly a common drop - in fact, from personal experience, it looks to be about the same as the drop of Essence of Winter.  The real problem is the number of spawns being hunted.  Seafury Island can easily support 6 to 10 groups, constantly pulling cyclops.  The outside of Permafrost has 3 spawns, no more.  My suggestion would be twofold, actually.  Cut the need for Frost Temper out of REGULAR Northman Ringmail - make it use some high skill brew, like a Halas Heater, mabye.  Second, make a few more creatures drop the essences - maybe the yeti's in the Dreadlands and golra in the Timerous Deep.<P>PS - Yak, some acknowledgement on this issue would be nice.  I'm starting to feel like a mushroom here...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
