</FONT><HR>Ester!  It's great to have you back.  I am including two posts from the EQForge message boards to help you test the "Matter of Betrayal" khukri quest that has frustrated us for 4 months now.  The first post is a transcript of the quest trigger, the second is a compiled and verified fact list.  The fundemental problem is that we simply cannot find the disguised Hero Goxnok to hand him his coin.  Most attention has been focussed on the bookseller Dom K'Perl in the Overthere, and the Firiona Vie border patrolers as candidate Goxnoks.<P>-------------------------------- Quest Trigger Post ----------------------------<BR>-------------------------------- Spoiler Alert---------------------------------------------<BR>(source Xansi on EQForge)<P>Luckily there is another quest after the Zealots Khukri quest. Here is the entire conversation as it will save you some time and more heads solving this are better than one <BR>After turning in the chalp diagram and knight khukri to Lord Qyzar he says<P>At last! The Chalp Diagram. I shall see that the emperor gets this at once. You have proven yourself more than a mere knight, you are a zealot. Being new to the temple we have need of you in a [matter of betrayal].<BR>**what matter of betrayal?**<BR>One of our agents, a Hero by the name of Goxnok, has found evidence that the book titled, Charasis, has been taken from this temple and is to be delivered to an unknown foe in the Outlands. Go at once to the lower levels of the temple and greet Goxnok. Hurry before the departs<BR>(if you head west and go down the tower stairs he will be waiting at the bottom and is call an iksar crusader)<BR>**Hail Goxnok**<BR>Hail fellow crusader. Hero Goxnox of the Temple of Terror is ready to do the bidding of his lords. Ar you the one who is to [apprehend the traitor]<BR>**i will apprehend the traitor**<BR>I was told a Duke would attend the matter. Still, if the Lords have sent you then you must be able to complete the task. The [traitor] most certainly must be stopped from delivering the [Charasis Tome]. the [recipients] appear quite formidable and i cannot handle such a deed, not single handed.<BR>**who is the traitor**<BR>I am afraid i do not know. The babble is that he is from Cabilis, but he could have been a disguised Sarnak. Who knows. The tink is that at night within the Outland Territory, near the old skinless outpost, they are to meet. We should depart at once. Go get outfitted and let me know when you are [ready to depart]<BR>**what is the charasis tome**<BR>The Charasis Tome, the tome of the old city of Charasis. It was taken from this temple and must be returned. I and the one sent to [apprehend the traitor] who thieved the tome, must be [ready to depart] at once.<BR>**who are the recipients**<BR>The [spider riders]!! I have only heard tales of them from dieing lizards. Evil skinless stubs...Their steeds must have also joined the fray for some of the victims were covered in webs.<BR>**what spider riders**<BR>As i have reported, the babble states they appear to be skinless stubs who ride giant spiders. Most encounters occur when the moon is high. Little is known about them and only in recent weeks have they appeared.<BR>**i am ready to depart**<BR>Very well. I shall follow shortly. You must depart on your own. Go to the plains of the old skinless outpost. Beware, they have returned and patrol the hillside. Keep an eye on the gates fo the outpost. I will be disquised withing their ranks, I shall kneel as a sign. Give me this coin as your sign (he hands you a lore, no drop coin. Then he despawns shortly afterward)<P>-------------------------------- Fact List Post ----------------------------<BR>-------------------------------- Spoiler Alert---------------------------------------------<BR>(Source Caskorrn on EQForge) me :O)<P>* Hero Goxnok says<BR>"Very well. I shall follow shortly. You must depart on your own. Go to the PLAINS of the OLD SKINLESS OUTPOST. Beware, they have RETURNED and PATROL the HILLSIDE. Keep an eye on the GATES of the outpost. I will be disquised within their ranks, I shall KNEEL as a sign. Give me this coin as your sign." <P>*The Overthere outpost is in a huge plain, Firiona is not. No other outposts mentioned host "skinless" beings that have "returned".<P>*Dark Elves likely count as skinless to Goxnok, because he refers to "spider riders" as "skinless stubs", and the upper halves of drachnids look identical to dark elves. Presumably, scaleless means skinless to an Iksar.<P>*The hillside of the Overthere is patrolled by dragoons starting at 11pm. They go to the end of the path, then respawn back in the outpost in the morning. <P>*Charasis is a dungeon in the canyon in the Overthere, The Howling Stones.<P>*The Overthere does not have abundent drachnids, Firiona does. <P>*According to Goxnok, the ONLY chance of meeting the traitor is during the meeting, which will be at night outside the outpost. <P>*The deliverer of the tome (the traitor) is "rumoured to be from Cabilis" but "may be a disguised sarnak"<P>*The Overthere is teeming with sarnaks<P>*The Iksar prisoner in the Overthere is level 15, scowls at Iksars, and pleads(the /plead emote) when hailed.<P>*Dom K'Perl, the book seller in The Overthere outpost, is interested in rare Iksar books.<P>*Dom K'Perl kneels (the /kneel emote) when asked about [rare finds].<P>*No other NPCs regularly present in the Overthere outpost kneel when hailed by a level 9 Ogre shaman (aprrehensive con), or kneel when their bracketed text is mentioned.<P>*Dom K'Perl cons dubious to Iksar SKs, while all dragoons, gargoyles, golems, sentinels, admirals, generals, undead heralds, and at least some undead marines, undead workers and merchants scowl. <P>*No common NPCs in Firiona Vie kneel to a level 8 indifferent high elf enchanter.<P>*One undead worker cons indifferent and is part of an Iksar necro quest. The two skeletel pets con indifferent.<P>* Hero Goxnok is exactly level 30 (source: a level 30 SK posting on Everlore)<P>* Dom K'Perl is exactly level 30<P>* No other common NPCs in the Overthere outpost are below 40, except for the skel pets of the general and admiral. <BR>(source for the above two facts: allakhazam beastiary)<P>* There is a place you can stand uninvis next to Dom without aggroing the sentinels or guardian.<P>* Handing Dom the coin yields the standard "trying to buy friends?" message that he gives when you hand him any random item.<P>*Doing the same thing but getting invised before hitting the Give button in order to get an indifferent con yields the same results.<P>* All of the level 30 guards in Firiona Vie, ie Private Blackbark, Private Goldtouch, and Dune the Wolf scowl at Iksars. So does Sergeant Greenblade, Scout Treekill, and all the other guards anyone has conned.<P>*The Forbidden scribe in the hidden West Cabilis tunnel sells the exact same set of 3 books that Dom does.<P>*One of these books is lore no drop, written in Lizardman, and tells of Dag, the Blasphemer of Kotiz (Kotiz is the founder of the Necro guild, thus "The Brood of Kotiz"). This seems to be tied to a Dalnir quest.<P>*You can hand Dom an emerald to recieve "Before Green", a tome of ancient Iksar history that can be purchased for 3 copper in Cabilis. Giving the emerald yields no noticable change other than the book appearing in your inventory.<P>*While sitting in the dragoon barracks at 5am norrath time, I once heard a smack followed by the death groan of some unseen mob. The sound seemed to be coming from right next to me.<P>*I have never seen confirmatin of ANY inter-zone trigger in EQ. (ie, doing something in one zone that causes something in another zone to happen). Nonetheless, I often tried giving the "ready to depart" phrase to Goxnok with a lvl 1 mule, and this had no immediate or delayed effect in the Overthere or Firiona Vie that I could detect. <P>*Dom K'Perl wants his spare reading spectacle, and blood ink for some unknown reason. His spare reading spectacle comes from froglok raiders in the swamp and is called "a lens of sorts". Ticket stubs from Oasis to Kunark, and ticket stubs bearing Dom's slogan "strain the brain not the eyes" can also be found on raiders.<BR>(I got the lens and ticket stubs off raiders, others have said other frogs can drop them) <BR>Source: SSlith on this board, see "Dom K'Perl - matter of betrayal".<P>*Blood ink can be obtained from the War Historian in the Warrior Guild in ECab. He needs blood drops from leeches, carnivorous plants, and mosquitos, and one from the blood pit in the Tower of Death.<P>* The Tower of Death is the Necro Guild. There is a prominant pit of blood at the entrance to the Necro Guild. <BR>(Source: the intro description you get when creating a newbie Iksar Necro, and the necro newbie note. Both reference the Tower of Death as your guild hall).<P>*Nobody has successfully obtained blood ink and posted their solution.<P>*Lord Qyzar wants "The Charasis Tome, it's copy, and your zealots khukri"<BR>Source: Xander on this board<P>*Sometimes, when Dorn B'Dynn is killed, "a dark elf spy" pops up. When the spy dies, a "widow mite" spider spawns and drops "The Tome of Charasis", which ID's with "Item Lore: Charasis Tome Copy".<P>*All 3 mobs yield "agents of mistmoore" faction hits, while the normal Dorn does not. Note that sometimes Dorn appears as Dorn B'Dynn, and sometimes as Dorn BDynn (no apostrophe). I had heard that only Dorn BDynn can spawn the spy, but this is NOT true as I saw B'Dynn spawn the spy with my own eyes.<P>* Dorn can technically be level 15 or level 16 but if you are not level 30 or twinked to the gills, good luck soloing him, the spy, and the spider in succession. Dorn double attacks repeatedly for max damage, has a lot of hitpoints, and extremely high magic resistance.<P>*The spy is a level 22 necro (red to a 19, xp giving green to a 30) and the widow mite is (I believe) a level 10 sk. <BR>Source: Everlore boards.<P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Note:  other theories have been tested, involving the sarnak fortresses, the old Combine Empire Outpost in the Dreadlands, the underwater Troll caverns in Field of Bone, Castle Mistmoore, lesser Faydark, and the list goes on and on.  Too numerous to include everything here.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to give a huge thanks to Ester on this one.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Oh and the post above pretty much covers it all. We don't know what the reward is but most people assume its another Khukri, more than likely a Duke's Khukri. One thing that should be mentioned is something about the visceral dagger quest, which is, someone posted some info about it, and when the dagger is given to Qyzar I believe it is, he says something about turning in a Crusader's Khukri along with the dagger. I assume this quest is for the Blade of Greenmist, so these 2 quests should probably be checked out as well. As we can't finish the current "matter of betrayal" quest, I don't have the dialog, but they should be the next 2 consecutive quests. Thanks again Ester!<P>Drahkanis ShadowKnight in the 27th level of hell</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another broken iksar sk quest is the quest for the KNIGHT'S KHUKRI, given by LORD KORZIN in EAST CABILIS.<P>The starting phrase to the quest, "what skull of torture", was only found through reverse engineering, i.e. someone got lucky, handed the skull from Kurn's Tower to Korzin, and got the reward.  <P>There is NO CONNECTING PHRASE between LORD GIKZIC, who gives the previous khukri quest and finishes by referring you to "another lord of pain", and LORD KORZIN.  <P>People aren't complaining about this one because they have been able to complete the quest, but it is extremely bugged.  No one would be able to complete this quest without finding another iksar sk who had done it or by consulting the web.<P>An ADDITIONAL COMMENT:<BR>The 10 pages of a tome quest given by Lord Gikzic in East Cabilis is ridiculous.  It requires you to get *10* (you start with 1) unique lore items off of pretty rare spawns (froglok raiders) in the Swamp of No Hope.  What other quest in the game requires 10 unique lore items?  The time required to complete this quest is ridiculous.  You can do the math and see that as you get 7-8 of these pages, almost every page you subsequently get is going to be one you already have.  Please look into this and help the young iksars who haven't done this quest yet.  <P>Thanks for listening,<BR>Bach<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>only problem with that is the quest requires a copy of the tome, which is dropped by Dorn in Nro, along with the original, or so we are made to believe. (Dorn's identifies as a copy of Charasis Tome). That being the case, we still don't know where to get the original (D'om more than likely). And who to give the coin and copy to. The quest seems to be able to go in a number of directions, i.e. We give the coin and the copy to D'om and he provides us with the real tome, which we give to Qyzar along with our Khukri, or We give the copy of the tome to the bookkeeper and he copies that one and gives us both tomes, then we have to find someone else that kneels, to give him the coin and both tomes, in which he gives us something else to give to Qyzar along with our Khukri. It can go many directions, all of which have been explored... to no avail. <P>Drahkanis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My belief on this tome is that because we are missing a portion of the quest, that we have to obtain the original book by breaking up the meeting with the drachnids, and then take the original book to Dom K'Perl and give him the following:<P>Charasis Tome (original)<BR>Blood Ink<BR>Bookmark with strange writing on it<BR>Lens of Sorts<P>If you give him either of the last two items, he tells you that he needs those items, but says (the book to be copied) in place of charasis tome.  Two of the items drop from froglok raiders in Swamp of no hope, and the blood ink is another broken Isar warrior quest.<P>Once you have the copy you would give it to the appropriate spy and then intercept Dorn before he has a chance to deliver it.

</FONT><HR>OK. I am not sure whether this quest is bugged, and after reading this thread I am pretty sure Dom K'Perl is involved in the quest ... but I'm also sure he's not the first person you have to talk to after you see Goxnox(k).<P>Fact: There are NO drachnids in the overthere and Dom K'Perl is not a guard at the gate of the outpost. If he is the first person we are supposed to see, the quest is as messed up as any other.<P>Fact: Firiona Vie is an old elven out post. It has architecture different than other cities in Kunark, and is crawling with drachnids which NPC's in Firiona also mention are recent arrivals.<P>Fact: Many guards and scouts from Firiona Vie "Patrol the Plain" between the stream and the zone to the dreadlands KILLING drachnids and commenting about it.<P>Conjecture: Goxnox is disguised as one of these NPCs. When spotted by an Iksar SK who *has* a zealot's khukri equipped he will kneel. When given the coin he will launch into *another* spiel about the stuff that needs to be given to Dom K'Perl and how he will also kneel as a sign when he is Dom K'Perl.<P>There's just no way this quest only involves the Overthere. Goxnox(k) spends too much time talking about the drachnids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a shot in the dark...<P>Is it possible you all are off on the drachnid assessment? While I agree that it does sound like that's what he's talking about (spider riders and webs) there are also some scorpionlike Iksar creatures (of course their name escapes me) in Overthere. They are white, and hense perhaps considered 'skinless' by other Iksar. <P>I say this because the dialogue with the Lord refers to the outpost as 'the old skinless outpost'. I find it hard to believe that the Iksar would be unaware that Dark Elves and such inhabit the fort now. Perhaps by saying 'the old skinless outpost' he means that it was once inhabited by the white (hense skinless) Iksar and they no longer live there. <P>Ok, so this is a pretty far out theory.

</FONT><HR>Well, moving off of the "matter of betrayal" quest for a moment, there is another quest which could use some investigating.  That would be the quest for Greenmist - The Unholy Khukri of Rile.<P>Many clues lead to the crypt of Dalnir for obtaining further information on the location of this weapon.  Most will agree that with the usage of "a crusader coffin" we will be able to ressurrect poor fallen Crusader Golin.  From Lumpy Goo on level two drop 2 lore bone chips which identify as Crusader Golin:  Upper Torso, and Lower Torso respectively.  An iksar skull with a pierced cranium can also drops from the same goo I believe.  The crusader coffin is used by combining no less than three bones of a fallen crusader as well as that crusader's weapon and hitting combine.  The problem is that golin's weapon does not drop in dalnir or at least it would seem that way.  This is a major part of solving the greenmist quest, which I believe lies in howling stones (AKA Charasis) but we must find a way to make the enslaved iksar (in jail at temple droga) trust us.  My thought is that upon ressurrecting golin, you would either <BR>a)recieve the shard which combines with the obsidian hilt <BR>b)recieve an item that will make Argest trust you enough to give you the location of the book (which in turn grants you the location of Greenmist) <BR>or c)will be another broken part of the quest.<P>Some believe that perhaps the tower guard blade is Golins weapon as it identifies as "iksar protector" (Nobody has posted success nor failure in attempting this) but that doesn't fit the profile of a crusader of Greenmist.  They wield Khukris.<BR>Could you check the loot tables in Dalnir and maybe with the quest designer to find out if Golin's weapon is supposed to drop in Dalnir at all, or if it is an entirely different quest line?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Not to mention that the Scorpikis con red to a level 33 Shadow Knight and this particular quest is at a much lover level than 30.  The Scorpikis have nothing to do with this quest.  Also, the Scorpikis do not patrol the hills.

</FONT><HR>Okay, I don't know where people get the idea that Greenmist is going to be a part of the Khukri line of quests.  If you speak to Lord Qyzar, and mention Greenmist, he spazzes out with excitement... because the thing has been missing for centuries.  Hence, how could they possible let you hand in your khukri and get greenmist as the reward?  Greenmist is buried in a tomb somewhere and it is a BIG quest with many pieces to the puzzle... much like the fiery avenger quest from what I've seen thus far.  So, yes, this does need some investigation too... since golin's weapon is required to ressurect him and presumably get a further clue on how to find Rile's Weapon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My guess.   <BR>Matter of betrayal returns the hero khukri.  Next quest is the Visceral dagger quest.<BR>Complete that and we get the Crusader Khukri.   Combine the Crusader Khukri with golin's bones in the crusader coffin and get an inkling into how the greenmist Khukri quest starts.<P>At least that's my take on the whole situation.<P>Skraith.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually Rask, I know you may have meant it the other way around, but the babble is that when you turn in the visceral dagger, you have to include your crusader khukri and if you turn in the visceral dagger without the khukri, Qyzar tells you (paraphrased) "You are no HERO!"  What the reward will be is speculation at this point, and for all anyone knows up to now, there could be a continuing sequence of khukris such as:  Zealot, Crusader, Duke, Lord, and one would guess that the khukri of an emperor would be better than a Lord.  Remember that Goxnox looks at your weapon and says he presumed a duke would be assisting him.  Hence, the only way we'll know anything for SURE is to wait until Ester and her crew finish the checkups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>well since we still haven't heard anything back and no one as far as i can tell has gotten the next Khukri I can only assume the quest is broken.<P>what a pain.  Consider - Iksar SK have the highest experience cap of any race/class combo in the game.<P>I started this character to slowly progress through this quest.  It's frustruating when you find out something is broken only after you've gotten to play with it a bit.<P>*sigh*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/001413-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/001413-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/001413-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/001413-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/001413-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=001413&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=001413&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
