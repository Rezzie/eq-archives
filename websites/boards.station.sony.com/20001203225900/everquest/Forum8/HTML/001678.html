</FONT><HR>Hmmmm... I did some hunting of spiderlings myself (mostly kill em when I see them while running through newbie areas)<P>I get at least one silk off probably 50% of them. I'd say thats a pretty good ratio. This is through Misty Thicket, the Commons, GFay, and Butcherblock. haven't checked anywhere else, though I know through a guild mate, that it's at LEAST 50% in Nektulos as well.<P>Honestly, I don't see it as a problem at this point, though it did feel like a shortage when the FS plate first went into productin, and there were hundreds of people looking for spiderlings to make leather padding.<P>Balkin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I am not sure how you get to a fifty percent drop rate based on your hunting habits.<P>I know that when I make a concerted effort to hunt them in Tox and EC I can spend an hour easily and only come up with  10 to 15 silks or so. 5 to 10 threads for the time.<P>If you don't mind taking the time to do it, please set aside an hour or two and hunt them. See if the results from your time invested compare to the percentages you just gave. I think you'll find that they don't.<P>On a related note, I appreciate your posting but do you feel like increasing the drop rate is bad somehow? If so, why? If not, then why recommend that the drops not be increased?<P>Rreku</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>I bought probably a few hundred from the newbie lift vendor in Gfay. They might not show you so you buy other junk and combine it in a large sewing kit until theydo. Nice thing then is you buy 2, hit combine then left clic your picture in the upper right and it goes into your inventory wherever you already put one. You can keep doing this in buy mode until you have a full stack then you need to esc out and start a new one, repeat.

</FONT><HR>Another tip for digging into back stock at vendors is to go to the less popular zones, provided it has been awhile since the last server or zone down-time.  I found over 300 spiderling silks on one of the vendors in Misty thicket one time.  Haven't had as much luck with HQ pelts, but considering how long it takes to hunt one down in the wild, I'm happy to spend 15 minutes digging into a vendor to find a just a couple or three.<P>-Zem</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Everything that is sold to a vendor does go into<BR>his/her inventory, you just don't get to see<BR>it when their display is all filled up.<P>So, you find something cheap and, preferably, stackable and buy it out.  If you have the patience, sell it to another vendor (Unless this is the first vendor you are delving, in which case just blow it up in a large sewing kit).<P>Now, if you are looking for something specific, say, a spidering silk, once you have the empty slot in their inventory, sell them a spiderling silk.  IF the silk jumps into that slot, they don't have any, move on.  BUT if it doesn't, it has joined it's brothers and sisters buried in their backstock, just waiting for you to find it.<P>So, you escape out and right click again.  All the inventory will have moved up and something new will be on the end.  Rinse, repeat until you get what you want.<P>Of course, if you want tons of stuff, just keep digging.  Look for my post on page two about backstock. That will give you an idea how much good stuff you can get (11 stacks of silk swatches, 39 stacks of backings, etc).  Takes time and money, but in the long run it is worth it.<P>Gryfalia<BR>26 Cleric of Brell, Druzzil Ro<BR>Master Smith (183)<BR>Master Brewer (141)<BR>Master Potter (111)<BR>Journeyman Tailor (70)<BR>Bad cook (45)<BR>Silver Wolf Pack<P>PS - make sure you aren't buying something they<BR>normally stock.

</FONT><HR>So, 2 posts saying that their experience has been far different than mine for looting spiderling silks and several posts on buying backstocked items.<P>I'll give the vendors a try but I'd much rather just kill the spiderlings myself and loot the item - nothing beats free =). Except this is what I have had for the last several weeks: loot 7, get one silk, loot 5, get two more silks, loot 5, get one more silk. No kidding...that has been my experience with spiderlings.<P>Incredibly unlucky?

</FONT><HR>Personally I would like to be able to convert silk swatches into silk threads, similar to the pelt downgrading already implemented.  Combine a silk swatch with a skinning knife and get 5 silk threads back.

</FONT><HR>Spiderlings also will swarm on young'ns if you allow them to.  Help a young'n get past his first few levels and reap the benefits! Each harvester has their own results.  I believe that I get more silkings on average than when looting silks from the large or giant spiders in the Commons.   <P>If you are seriously trying to find a constant flow of spiderlings, I would suggest heading up to EverFrost.  I've also camped the jungle ruins in Ferrott, but I found chasing them around the stumps a bit more work - plentiful they are.  Misty Thicket is a smaller overall newbie zone and as Zem mentioned, easy to find silkings in stock when checking the mounds.  (I wish their door holes were a tad taller - tough even when crouched to get in).<P>I don't see increasing the drop rate across Norrath as an overall solution.   The Commons and NRo greens have a scattering of them, but mixed in with fire beetles, wolves/jackals and bears/armadillos.  Find a zone where the competiton for them is much lower, even in the Nekutolas forest, I've heard there are plenty of padding critters to satisfy demand for Teir'Dal folk.<P>EverFaithful</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A merchant mining tip:<P>Buy up all of one visible item in the merchant's inventory, then SELL one of the item you are looking to buy from the merchant.  If your item is shown in the recently emptied slot, the one you sold is the only one the merchant has.  If the slot remains open, the merchant has more of that item hidden away.

</FONT><HR>That, Grimnar, is an excellent idea!<P>I'd accept that as a comprimise to increasing the drop rates on spiderling silks and it fits nicely into hunting in zones where cat pelts are plentiful (EK is my haunt for pelts).<P>I haven't tried Ferrott for silks but I might give that a shot. As far as I am concerned, Nek is out for me. As a Druid, I don't want to fall victim to the super buffed newbie Guards.

</FONT><HR>Having created just about every newbie imaginable, I have to say IMHO that Nek forest is the best zone for would-be tailors. it SWARMS with spiderlings for 'ling silk and easy to kill large spiders for regular spider silk. Most newbies dont kill the spiderlings for their tendancy to gang up when attacked, and chase decaying skels for bones to sell to high level necros instead, so the spiders are often unharvested. A character can go up to level 8 on spiderlings and large spiders alone, and be at about 40 tailoring if they choose. When a "new" server goes up and "the race" starts, I usually start a DE mage or necro and by the time I am level 5 or so I have most of a suit of raw silk armour on, and am selling raw silk to other players at about 35 tailoring skill.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Look where does it stop?  Your asking for one of the most common items in the game to drop more.  Lets make it so Quality pelts drop more....lets make it so that on Crag spiders they always drop 6 silks or more.  Lets make it so that lions, bear, and wolves _always_ drop HQ pelts (we can always lower them if we want to).  Lets make it so patterns also drop....wouldn't that make it less frustrating to have a bear drop both the HQ pelt and the pattern (I know I'm getting _REALLY_ rediculous now).  But the point is you are complaining that one of the most common drops in the game is not dropping enough.  Name me one type mob anywhere that drops an item as much as Spiderling silk and is as common as spiderling silk?  I can think of a few spawns that always have an item, rabid wolves and grizzlies in Q Hills but then agian they aren't that common. (hint there is one and I think the spawn rate on it should drop.  Zombies drop Zombie skins more than anything I've seen.)<P>Talk about me whining.....listen to yourself. (enough flaming).<P>If you up the spawn rate on this _VERY_ common item then people will say "What about HQ Pelts", "What about Tempers".  <P>Everyone wants to make the skills easier but don't think about what that will do to the econemy.  <P>You ask for opinions...I gave you mine.  Are you asking for opinions that only agree with yours?<P>Look at my skills....I'm not talking without knowing.  I've done _EVERYTHING_ you are talking about.  And frankly spiderling silks has to be the easiest part of tailoring.  Wait until you have to kill Lions and Lionesses for 4-5 days straight to get your skill from 88 - 115.   Even then I don't think it is unreasonable.  As the skill gets higher is should get harder to get to the next skill level.  Just like leveling.

</FONT><HR>Before the patch, there was no demand for spiderling silks, other than to sell to vendors.<P>So, requesting their drop frequency be increased due to increased demand is a rather silly thing, isn't it?<P>BTW, you do know that it _isn't_ Yaka's job to answer your questions, right?

</FONT><HR><P>&gt;SemperFi - Do you know how to politely disagree? Seriously. Or do you only know how to flame?<BR>See, calling me lazy and a whiner is not disagreeing with my position on the issue - it is attacking me.<P>Yes I do, sorry for stateing my opinion without the numbers (real numbers to back it up are just down a bit)<P>&gt;Throwing out some friggin ridiculous numbers is not disagreeing with my position - it is being absurd at the expense of the point you are trying to make.<BR>I've done what I said I would...here are 4 zones and the drop rates <BR>Oh btw the real numbers show your 10 - 15 silks in a hour as ...well... _EXTREMELY_ unlucky and if you made it sound like a one off thing i'd say you just had some bad luck.  If you say this does constantly happen to you I am then saying you are DEFLATING your numbers drastically<P>Note that all of this was done without any tracking ability (which should increase the rate a little bit) and the most successful while practically blind.<P>Anyway here are the figures<P>Zone               : East Common (east end of wooded zone near first set of inns with guard)<BR>Time               : 20 minutes<BR>Spiderlings killed : 32<BR>Silks obtained     : 26<P><BR>Zone               : Nek Forest (just north of Wizard portal)<BR>Time               : 20 minutes<BR>Spiderlings killed : 38<BR>Silks obtained     : 43<BR>NOTE: this was done by my level 29 monk in the dead of night when I could hardly see also.  I'd expect that during the day my rate would be slightly higher<P>Zone               : Greater Faydark (North East corner of zone)<BR>Time               : 20 minutes<BR>Spiderlings killed : 28<BR>Silks obtained     : 14<P>Zone               : EverFrost Peaks (right outside Halas)<BR>Time               : 20 minutes<BR>Spiderlings killed : 25<BR>Silks obtained     : 11<P>Time total         : 1 hour 20 minutes or 80 minutes<BR>Spiderlings killed : 123<BR>Silks obtianed     : 94<P>that is about 70 silks per hour and 1.5 spiderlings a minute.  <P>The numbers show that clearly the drops are fine. <P>Agian sorry for throwing my guesses of the numbers out.  your right 2 a minute was a bit high.<P><BR>&gt;Telling me that I will be the downfall of the Tailoring skill because I think that spiderling silk drops should be looked at doesn't express some deep meaning - it simply shows that you have a flair for overstatement. What is trivial for silk threads? 15 or 20? How the hell is that going to spell disaster for Tailoring to have silk drops increased?<P>You are only looking at the imediate effect on the people that make the silk threads not the additional effect of making harder item easier to make thus increasing the supply and lowering the price.<P>&gt;Gee. I don't know. I am not trying to be a Saint, I'd just like to have this frustrating thing looked at.<BR>Like I said, and others agree here, your frustration isn't really founded as the numbers go.<P><BR>&gt;Ummmm. I dunno about silks being one of the most common items in the game. Where'd you get that?<BR>Personal experience from playing for 1 and 1/2 years with way to much time invested in the game.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;Name me one type mob anywhere that drops an item as much as Spiderling silk and is as common as spiderling silk?<P>&gt;Willowisps and burned out lightstones. Happy?<BR>don't know about that.  On average spiderling silk drops more because not every wisp has a burntout stone, some have light stones, some have greater light stones, some actually have no stones.  Plus Wisps are not as common as spiderlings and are alot harder to kill.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;If you up the spawn rate on this _VERY_ common item then people will say "What about HQ Pelts", "What about Tempers". <P>&gt;*sigh*<P>&gt;People already say that.  <P>Yea and if they make this _VERY_ common drop more common it provides a presidence that everyone else can use in their arguements.<P>&gt;Everyone wants to make the skills easier but don't think about what that will do to the econemy.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;hehe. Read my question again. And, leave out whatever it is you think I am saying.<BR>you say its frustrating because the silks don't drop fast enough for you.  If you make them drop faster it makes the skills easier because you have to invest less time.  No big brain power needed to see that.<P>&gt;NO, I did not ask for opinions. I posted a question in this area because I wanted an answer/response from the people at VI. This happens to be a public board so people tend to weigh in with their own opinions.<P>your quote "On a related note, I appreciate your posting but do you feel like increasing the drop rate is bad somehow? If so, why? If not, then why recommend that the drops not be increased?"<BR>that to most people is asking for opinions<P>your quote "I'd still like to hear from whomever monitors this particular forum if that is possible."<P>the answer - VI don't offically monitor these boards to reply....ie it is Yak's decision to make comments .... not his jobs ... the boards are to build more of a community between players.<P><BR>&gt;I can deal with that if they are done in a mature fashion. I can deal with it if they are not - for example, your post.<P>&gt;For the record, I neither solicited nor want your opinion or posts. /wave<P>see above<P><BR>&gt;Like I said, I didn't ask for anyone but a VI rep to respond - this board is the only way I know of to pose a question to them. If there is another way that is not public, I'll gladly use it to avoid wasting time responding to posts like the one you made.<P>See your quote above<P>&gt;Wait until you have to kill Lions and Lionesses for 4-5 days straight to get your skill from 88 - 115.<P>Why do you assume that I have less than 85 in Tailoring? As it happens, I have 99. I hunt lions whenever I feel like it. I have a lot of fun doing it too - charm a griff and kill massive amounts of lions in EK.<P>so you think killing lions and getting a drop rate less than spiderling silks is ok?  wouldn't that be more frustrating....why don't you just charm a kodiak and kill everything in east commons newbie end....the newbie areas don't run dry like North Karana.  You kill a newbie mob and somewhere in the newbie area a mob spawns imediately to replace it.  This was really apparent a about a year ago in Qeynos where there was 2 faucets of that spawned mobs in one place as soon as you killed one.  Point being the more newbie stuff you kill the more spiderlings you'll get and the more silk you will get... you should be able to get alot better results then a mana dependent  wizard like me.<P>&gt;And, my gawd, did you even read my post? I think I was pretty reasonable and I even included this here (so you don't have to scroll back up):<BR>"Can the rate of drops for silks be upped without skewing the game balance (assuming that is a consideration)?"<P>Yes I did and I would say it can't because I can see beyond the imediate effect of just making your like a little easier (ie less frustrating and time consuming)<P><BR>Reztarn Solarflare 51st Channeler Terris-Thule<BR>Master Tailor (115) &lt;- waiting for the upgrade<BR>Master Brewer (145) &lt;- Whatdya haven?<BR>Master Potter (172) &lt;- This is useful...how?<BR>Master Smith (166) &lt;- made my first set of FS with 35 attempts<BR>Master Drinker(200) &lt;- BuUuUuUuRrPp!!!!!!!<BR>Master Begger (189) &lt;- What a waste of time<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/001678-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/001678-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001678&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001678&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
