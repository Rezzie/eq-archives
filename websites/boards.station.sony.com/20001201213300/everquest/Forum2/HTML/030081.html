</FONT><HR>I have been playing this game for a long time now. I have seen new spells added for every class, and for kunark and such. I havent leveled in over a month, because I have nothing of excitement to look foward to. I dont understand how wizards can be called wizards.. When I think of a wizard.. I think of ungodly power. And sadly we are the weakest caster class there is. I have just seen the spells that were listed on the test server.. and I began to laugh.. until I read the spells that other classes classes get, then became almost frustrated with sadness. Druids get pets? Mages get dots? Shamans get bear form? necros can look like thier pets now..Enchanters get group warewolf form.. and we get invis undead and a 6pt damage shield.... yippee.. Explain to me how a wizard came about. Because the way I see it, we are just the leftover class after all the other magics were peeled from the classes into other classes... I have sat back and waited patiently for something exciting like Ice Comet to look forward to, and granted the 59 Sun spell is kinda neat.. the same things over and over again gets old. Sure we are the Direct Damage kings. But throw us something in there for fun. Other then a cheesy damage shield or another useless AoE. Give us a Drake form, it doesnt even have to add anything.. just to be different. Give us something for once that gives us power. Sure we can beat some melee classes depending on thier MR... and even at times.. our "low resisting" lure line gets resisted.. It gets a bit frustrating when all the other classes get totally excited.. and we wizard look and look and wait for that one break.. Im not asking for a dot, or a life tap or a pet.. Give us a form that we can take that at least "makes" us feel powerful or make harvest a 30 minute recast time, but allow it to give us full mana.. or at least something. Show people out there that a wizard is actaully a wizard....<P>The totally frustrated...<BR>Syndyania<BR>Wizardress of the 54th Circle<BR>Guildmistress of Celestial Might<BR>~Celestial Moon~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So far I haven't seen very much positive response from any of the classes about the new spells.  For wizards everybody's talking about Translocation although I don't see how a tank taxi spell at level 50 is going to be of any help.  <P>But ya, I'm still in amazement of Verant's bungling of the wizard class.  So far EQ is the only RPG I've every played with such a horribly designed wizard, especially in relation to the other classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>I too was dissapointed when I saw the spells: <P>1) 6 pt Damage shield that lasts a minute and a half<BR>   - Ok, they said DSes weren't part of the wizard class and they just gave us Okiels radiation as a "gift" spell to low level wizards.  If this isn't a wizard ability why give it to us? it's horribly mana inefficient and really useless. <P>1) IVU <BR>   - Ok, usefull in certain situations I guess.  I had hoped for something more.  It's self only (which I had hoped wouldn't be the case).  I'm not going to get excited about this spell <P>3) 44th Lure type spell (speculated)<BR>  -  Ok, this is good.  Lures are needed at lower levels to help out the class and this is something that many wizards can look forward to. <P>4) Translocation<BR>  -  Seems cool, lots of possible uses.  Could end up being a very powerful spell, or it could end up being an annoyance (tell bombs).  I actually look forward to this spell though.  I think it would be better if melee's could bind in more places though. <P>5) Superior Invis. <BR>  -  I'm not sure what it does, so I can't comment.  But to get it at 55 I'd imagine it would have to be prety special.<P>6) Level 60 DD<BR>  -  Ok, so it's mana efficient. It's got an 18 second recast time, and it's got the same save as our existing level 60 DD.  I hope this was an oversight. <P><BR>Either way, the only response we will get is "we didn't officially release this, let's just wait and see."  I hope they reconsider, I'd like to see some of the filler spells we get be made into usefull ones that expand the class rather than fill spell circles.  I'd like to put forward a suggestion of a Theft of Thought type spell (drain mana from caster mobs).  Anyway, I'm going to wait until Velious comes out to see. <P><BR>SolRoWizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes please do something for wizards. Playing on the new server TP there are only two wizards 46+ on the entire server. This realy sucks, since we will have considerable trouble getting to places like hate and sky. I can only attibute the lack of wizards to verant's neglecting of the class. I recently did a who count all wizards on our server and came up with only 39.<P>I can remember long before there were any 50 wizards, everyone playing the class was waiting for Ice Comment. A wizard wants to be able to cast a spell and have people saying Holy #$@% when they see the damage done, not chain cast medium damage spells like magicians.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Are we wizards supposed to only do raids? Yes we are usefull on level 50+ raids mostly because of the lure line of spells (VS for example).. but what about everyday grouping?  A cleric, an enchanter and a tank are the main elements of a good group, wizards are a filler.  Now I'm not saying that a lot of other classes arent but when you think of a wizard, in any fantasy realm, what do you think of? POWER .. hell thats why I chose to become a wizard in the first place.  For so long I looked forward to Ice Comet so that I could have a little bit of that power I dreamed of but past level 50 I never use it anymore, we have more efficient spells that do less damage with a faster casting time.  Somehow I think wizards should have more base mana or some other spell that regens mana faster than clarity.. Wizards are the ONLY class in the game that relies completely on mana.. a blue mob that takes my entire mana pool to kill would only take a necro 35-40% of theirs.. and then they have lich form to regen mana! all the while here goes my wonderfull harvest spell so that I might have mana enough for one more cast.. pfft that really helps *sigh*.. enough ranting for me for one day  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Vicimus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yep the only reason wizards are needed.. is for VS and dragon raids because of our Lure spells, but for most of you that have done multiples of these raids as i have, know that most of the drops benefit the tanks. Im not complaining about this.. as if any wizards has made it to post 50 they know we get the raw end of the deal, I dont think I have even seen a wizard spell drop off VS on the tons of raids I have been on. /shrug but such is life..

You run to the bank, the merchants, and then yell "Need a Trans!"<P>Jarnin Fisheermann hears your yells from the coastline where he is restoring his boat and fishing. He sends the Ogre a tell saying he'll Trans him for 20 plat. Warrior says okie dokie.<P>Wiz binds on his boat. Warrior come to boat and Wiz casts Translocate. Wiz stays in the zone, Warrior is in his bind point. Warrior goes and rejoins his group, Wizards continues fishing.<P>This is a great spell just for the fact that I don't have to Port with the melees anymore. They should thank Verant for this spell.

</FONT><HR>I mentioned the possibility of have a dragon shapechanging spell of differing levels in various different posts.  This idea has been attacked from some, loved by others.  Some negative comments were that it had nothing to do with the class and that it would also make the class too powerful.<BR>I agree, the spell would be powerful.  It should give you the ability to fly, more hps, more AC, more magic resistance, and AE breath weapon and also faster mana regeneration.  Think about it.  You have changed your form to a dragon.  You have used a gemstone of some value to allow the change, so you should have good gain.  The spell could be made into various forms.  Low, mid and high level, with each having different level of bonus.<BR>I like the idea of being able to change into a dragon.  I have read many books and watch plenty of films and the idea is not totally outrageous.  So why not make it possible?  The mana regeneration element could be on a par with Breeze, i would prefer higher, but that would be asking too much.<BR>Give wizards this ability.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Im a 30th level wizard and Ive heard people ripping on us from level 1 but I always loved playing a wizzy...its fun and I love the whole damage thing, but it appears that at level 30 they start to become much less, I have been grouping at 30 and get killed...mind you I know how to play my wizards and I dont overnuke by anymeans....1-3 nukes toatl in a fight its worked and its kept me from being killed alot..until now that is. Also soloing, I know I know wizards arent ment to be good soloers well we have bonds of force (which almost always gets resisted even when im maxed in my specialization of it) and root and enstill which stick and then literally 3 secs later ware off. Im sorry but for supposedly being one of the strongest powers on norrath...we aint doin much. We get to teleport...oooh wow...I like it and all but walking is cool too...All I would like really is just a less resisted BoF or Root...Oh and yeah..The Drake form idead was awesome...depending on which drake you transform into you should have a higher resist and levitate IE; Fire drake=fire resist and levitate, Onyx drake higher magic resist and levitate. It would look really awesome and it would help a little. Hows that sound? =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Wizards are damn good when it comes to raids, we can do most dmg with 1 single nuke BUT what we cant do is long-time-dmg.<BR>A solution to this would be to give wizards a form of self-only clarity ( to use when enchanters are missing in the group ) or<BR> give wizards a pet ( which we dont want ) or<BR> give wizards dots ( dont want that either ) or<BR> *** should they give us?

</FONT><HR>Is it just me or is it strange that wizards are not better with their spells?  For a class that depends totally on their magic to survive you would think they would have worked out that monsters resisting your attacks are quite a bad thing.  Yes, we do get the lure line of spells and there is supposed to be the better an anti-resist bonus at 35, but is anyone one 100% certain it exists, it is like the maximum group experience bonus, some say it exists, others don't.  With only one certain anti-resist line of spells and one "maybe" on the anti-resist front, you would think that wizards would have thought of something else to give their magic a helping hand.  Perhaps a spell focusing enchantment or something.  Something that would sacrifice a little of the power of the spell to improve its ability to overcome inate resistance.<BR>I know that this sounds like another lure line of spells, but that wasn't how i was imagining it.  You have this focussing spell and this last for say thirty minutes.  It would cost a reagant like the skin line of spells.  It would then improve the penetration of every DD spell cast while the spell is active.  This is powerful, but you are talking about sacrificing say a fifth to a quarter of the damage of the spell to allow for the penetration bonus.<BR>This is important.  Wizards have the problem that if a monster cons red they can pretty much forget about getting a successful cast.  If they are very lucky they might only get a partial resist.  Since i have not used the lure line of spells i can't comment on how they perform, but i feel the spell focussing idea would allow wizards greater flexibility in the choice of their targets and also make them more group friendly because most groups will attack yellow to red monsters, to attack less is not really much of a challenge to a group.  (Low to mid levels, high levels are a law unto themselves which i am sure everyone realises.)<BR>The spell could come in three forms.  A low level one, say around level sixteen.  A mid level one, say around thirty.  And a high level one around level 49.  This spell line would not, in my opinion, be overpowering and it would be well appropriate to the wizard class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It was suggested a while back that wizards should gain the ability to do critical damage to monsters with their DD spells.  At the time the idea was met with interest and a "wait and see" response from Verant.  One thing that was felt to be a problem with the idea was that the wizards would increase their ability to aggro monsters.  Hmm.  Is it just me or don't we pretty much do that already?  We can get around the problem by using low level spells to do less damage per cast, but would the chance of doing extra damage be that troublesome to wizards?  I don't think so.  Most wizards would be able to account for the possibilty of the extra damage and plan their spellcasting accordingly.<BR>  So what is to stop us getting an ability to do critical damage with our spells?  Nothing as far as i can see.  It is appropriate for our class.  The wizard is so focussed on doing DD that it actually makes sense for them to be ability to do critical hits.  Warriors gain the ability to do critical hits because that is what they do.  They are trained to such a high level of ability that they can deliver attacks in a way that does more damage.  Wizards should be the same.<BR>  As for the problem with aggroing monsters on yourself because of the critical damage.  I think it is something that most wizards would not mind and would be able to deal with handedly.<BR>  Do my fellow wizards agree?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why do they call this class "Wizard" anyway? In just about every game I have ever played and every fantasy book written, Wizards are portrayed as a much more powerful class.  Look at us here compared to fellow casters, we are by far second rate when trying to get in regular groups.  And what Wizard doesnt have a "familiar" IE pet? Sheesh the mage, necro, druid, and even a dam shaman whos a healer of sorts gets a dam pet?  What kind of logic is that?  I am level 52 now and yes I can solo outside, but is this game not geared towards groups Verant?  Or are all you people working at Verant playing necros and don't really care bout the Wizard class, if so just tell me and I will start a necro  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  And did your designers put their underwear on too tight when they were coming up with new spells?...a 6 damage sheild?  You have got to be serious, don't even bother putting that spell on the vendors, its worthless! This game is by far the best out there now, and I love playing my wizard with all its shortcomings cause its a challenge and I know sooner or later someone at Verant will decide to play a Wizard and then they will want to fix the class, instead of playing necros and mages and pharming everything...I could almost bet that ever 75percent of the people selling crap on Ebay are necros. perhaps the employees their are earning extra income  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Give us a break, we dont want to me the uber class, we just would like to be fair game in a group and a pet we should have, and do something with that pitiful harvest, god a half bubble...cmon guys I am a total mana user! No pet, no melee, pure mana, give us self clarity or increase the harvest, and for god sake whats a wizard without a familiar (pet), and oh yea that thread above on illusion dragon/drake sounds nice, ok my first and last rant ever, I am done...I will give it to end of year then retire my Wiz and start my necro...sigh.

</FONT><HR>Lashanna,<BR>I did not assume she meant that.  What I assumed her statement related to was larger amounts of DD--significantly larger amounts.<P>Again, will not fit with class balance.  Frankly this is the biggest problem with the people complaining about wizards.  Namely, they are complaining about the gap between their expectations and the reality.<P>Unfortunately, such complaints tend to drown out and trivialize the other, much more valid and addressable complaints, such as, wizards being shunned by groups, wizard mana regen being too slow.  No wizard specific robe that is dropped by a mob that is of equivalent difficulty to the Robe of the Foci.  Lack of other wizard specific equipment.

</FONT><HR>Okay, you silly silly people.   You keep doubting the ownage of wizards?  Poor poor you.<P>Ever use Jyll's Static Pulse for starters?  For 285 mana I've down over 4000 damage and *gasp* not died.  Ever Watch 3 wizzies, an enchanter and a cleric work Disco?  There you go.  10 to 20 froggies dead in under a minute.  *sto*<P>New spells?  Solists Flame Spear or whatever that lvl 60 spell is.  1200 dmg, 300 mana?  Are you on crack?  How will this spell not -own-?<P>Draught of Ice, lvl 57.  Have you used this spell?  Lvl 56 was hell to me simply because I couldn't -wait- to use this spell.<P>And on that note, Pillar of Fire, nearly 950 damage for 385 mana I think it is, 4 targets....myriad of uses.<P>Tears of Solusek, 2000 dmg, nuff said.<P>Lure of &lt;insert element here&gt;.  The difference between a succesful raid and an unsucessful raid is how many wizards you have. <P>Okay, now...I'm sorry if you can't solo Trakanon by yourself.<P>Y'know what, nevermind, I'm sick of dealing with you, "I'm a lvl 5X wiz and we sux" because obviously, you're either lying and you're only 23, or you ebayed recently for that high level wiz.<P>GO 'way.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
