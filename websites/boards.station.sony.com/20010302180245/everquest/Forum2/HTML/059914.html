</FONT><HR>OMFG!!!<P>My world has begun to collapse.<P>That being said...<P>AE spells are screwed on Rallos.  That means that we as enchanters CAN'T ever use color flux/shift...ever.  Can we make it so that our group members and their PETS don't get affected please?<P>Also...enchanters and clerics are very screwed PvP because MR gear is the easiest and first resists to raise, and ALL of our offensive spells are MR based...ALL of them.  Tash is the only one, but it doesn't really help after a certain number in MR gear.  Can we get tash to do more reduction?<P>Those are the biggest things I can think of.<P>Oh...delevelers are becoming a nuisance.  There are guilds of deleveled melees who wait around banks and near FP and Qeynos just to gank people between levels 5-20.

</FONT><HR>lol.<BR>About 2 things good came out of the class talk threads and some nerfs.  More than likely all that's gunna come out of this thread is more nerfs because as Verant sees it, you don't need stuff improved, you need to nerf other stuff in order to "balance".<BR>BTW, the cleric nerf was a really dumb idea.  The necro "fix" *cough* nerf *cough* is going to be the dumbest possible thing you could do to achieve "balance".  Absor, you say that necros have a grouping role post 50 but that we just dont like it?  Well why is it that a warrior's, cleric's, chanter's, rogue's, monk's, &lt;insert almost every other class here&gt;'s role doesnt change post 50?  Oh and besides the fact that we are one of the few classes that it's role changes, the mana dump spells are highly HIGHLY HIGHLY INEFFICIENT at that.  Instead of mana dumping for the cleric, just bring a second cleric along and there's no need for the necro.<BR>/tap<BR>That's what I thought.<BR>Why in God's name was a cleric taunt and tank taunt brought into play when they are working perfectly fine.  No one mentioned this in any of the threads.  so w-t-f is up with that?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok from a casters point of view-i have a 60 necro and a 60 wiz on the same account-casters have received very little in the way of upgrades post 50. tanks-warriors and rogues in particuar-due to higher speed weapons and continually upgrading their equip and weapons and adding disciplines- are almost impossible to cast spells on without the use of shadowstep which cannot be used in tot because it takes you off the platform. duel wielding tanks with fast weapons can easily interupt spells with as low as a 3 second cast time. and most high level warriors are immune due to high mr gear to root screaming terror and fear.<BR>casters need some type of defense to keep these tanks off of us so we have a chance to cast a spell. maybe root should be much harder to resist in pvp. i know that doesnt help mages but it is a start.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor<P>Thanks for listening:<P>I have played on the pvp TEAMS servers for a while now and have many suggestions:<P>(1) Address the issue of rogues / warriors / monks "deleveling" so that they have skills far in advance of their current level. Nothing worse than being PK'ed at level 6 by a person with a last name.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>(2) 8 levels is too far a difference in levels. A caster can do nothing to a character more than 6 levels higher, yet can be attacked by them.  Reduce to 4 levels, please.<P>(3) One team server should be left as is (4 teams). The other team server should be made light versus darks (either class and religion based OR all races vs iksar/darkelves/trolls/ogres).  Allow a movelog for characters to choose whether they stay on the current 4 team set up or to the light vs dark server.<P>(4) Address cross team healing and so called OOR immortal healing. I don't have an opinion on this, but it seems that many people do. I can say that on a lighty raid of Nek woods the other day of low levels 12-20 we were very frustrated when the level 50 ogre shaman continually healed the darks we were fighting (with no oor healers of our own--even the darks were kind of mad at him).<P>(5) Not sure if SK harm touch resets on an exp death or not, haven't tried it yet (patch went in today). If it doesn't reset when killed by a MoB, this needs to be fixed. Suiciding to get it back is an issue, not exp dieing. <P>(6) Faction hits. Is there anyway to change the current system?  An 'aggressor' flag of some kind would be great, so that only aggressors take a faction hit, and not the people who get attacked.<P>I only play on the pvp teams server for roleplaying aspects, because I don't understand why I wouldn't try and kill an dark elf shadow knight if I saw one with my high elf paladin (much less team...ugh...up with him). I really think you guys should implement a 2 team good vs evil server.<P>Thanks Absor,<P>Good luck!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The reason I do not play on PvP servers is because EQ was not designed with PvP in mind. If EQ was DESIGNED for<BR>PvP, then the PvP aspect of it would be more appealing to me.<P>Here are the reasons I don't play PvP EQ:<P>1) I play a wizard.<BR>2) Wizard AE spells will hurt my own group.<BR>3) Equipment in EQ is SO time consuming to get that losing a pair of GEBs would just suck too much to have to deal with.<BR>4) Grief players.<BR>5) Grief players.<BR>6) Grief players.<BR>7) Grief players who run around killing people for no reason.<BR>8) Grief players who want to KS you, so they kill YOU first, then take your rare spawn.<BR>9) Grief players who can kill you all they want, but never have any consequences of faction.<P>Here is a list of items that would influence me to play PvP EQ:<P>1) No level loss on death. You can lose down to and empty bar on current level, but NEVER below.<BR>2) No EXP loss EVER from a PvP death.<BR>3) Wizard roots with about 25% or less resist rate, but break on one DD cast if rooting another player.<BR>4) Spells hit for FULL damage.<BR>5) You have a "PvP" bind as well as your normal bind. When you die to PvP, you go to your "PvP" bind spot which is ONLY in towns regardless of class, and your corpse is right beside you with ALL your money, items, and equipment on it. Only thing is you respawn there at 50% health, 50% mana, and 50% stamina.<BR>6) To qualify as a "PvP" death, at least 50% of your health must have been taken due to aggregate player damage. (Meaning if a NPC takes 90% of your health, your buddy can't kill you as an exploit)<BR>7) Players should face some kind of consequences from the NPCs in the world due to PKing. My idea is that if a person attacks you first, then you can kill them with no penalty. If you kill someone unprovoked, then you take a faction hit if they are on the same alignment as you. If you kill the same person 3 times in a certain time limit UNPROVOKED, then you are flagged as a murderer for a certain time limit, and are KOS to NPCs aligned with the victim.<BR>8) AE spells cast on NPCs would NEVER hit other players, but AE spells cast on a player would hit that player and any other player who has attacked you, and is in range.<BR>9) If you are killed by a PKer, you could hire a NPC "assassin" to get revenge for you. The "assassin" would be of equal level to the person who killed you for fairness.<P>These are just some of my ideas. Feel free to revise them, and add ones that I missed</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I was unlucky enough to create an enchanter on pvp back around april of 99. I can't belive how much Verant has ignored PvP. Either casters are to strong or mellee is to strong. They don't try to test it or make it better, they just throw a bone once a year and let the chips fall where they may. It's crazy that I spent so much time trying to get somewhere in this game, to just have Verant decide for me that I didn't take they road they wanted me to. <P>They should have never made the servers if they didn't plan on keeping them up.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thanks for starting this thread.<P>I'm sure you will hear from many who will ask you to change the Teams servers so that it is not possble to group with or heal people from other teams.  Please do not do this.  Many of the guilds on the team servers have developed around the idea of a light alliance--we have friends who we have grouped with for over a year.  You would be destroying communities if you were to make this change.  There are enough one team guilds to ensure plenty of conflict all around.  You could consider balancing the teams more carefully as far as class selections are concerned, this might make playing in a one team guild more appealing to some people and lead towards more balance overall.<P>Yeah maybe the light versus dark issue should be addressed, there are without doubt balance issues on the teams servers.  I just don't see that as a way to fix it.<P>One other comment--there are some faction issues that darks especially have to deal with on PvP servers that they do not on blue servers.  For example, darks cannot really hunt in karnors, cause it destroys their faction in the Overthere base.  On blue servers darks can work on Firona Vie faction and bind/bank there instead, but it's not even an option on pvp teams servers for them, and it's incredibly difficult for them to raise faction in Cabilis.  The PvE environment doesn't really make sense from a roleplaying perspective here, and it collapses in places on the PvP servers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fer cryin out loud Absor, the pvp problems of todays are the same ones that have always been there. Here are most of the complaints I remember.<P>1. No way to get your stuff back because the stuuf inside of bags isn't lootable. Lootable bags.<P>2. People being killed when they're at 1 bub of life after fighting a mob and the ganker getting to loot them. No pc loot rights unless they do 50% of your max hp in damage.<P>3. Delevelers.<P>4. Low gm/player ratio and gm's needing to be eyewitnesses means there might as well not be any rules. Can't you maintain server logs of people's actions for later review?<P>5. Loot and scoot: a verant rule, a player etiquette, what?<P>6. High level nukes and dots that can one shot low hp classes.<P>7. High player magic resists and clerics, enchanters only having magic based spells.<P>8. AE spells affecting party members and pets.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
