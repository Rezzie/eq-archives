</FONT><HR> You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688.html<P>This zone is sooo hard to get to and we have explored and tried every option that we can think of. 2 main guilds have made it up here and we opened it up to public disscussions to try different options and ideas. At this point both guilds (Soul Assassins and Triton) have given up on this zone and left. The only exception is Irontaail (Monk) and Adaru (Cleric) both in Triton on Povar. <BR>We have spent countless hours trying all suggestions to this zone. All we ask is ...<BR>IS THIS ZONE WORKING AND ITEMIZED? or are we wasting our time and we should wait till it is open?<P><BR>here are 2 links to huge dissussions and picture and things we've tried from this zone ...<P>http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=5749.topic<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052329.html<P>Please if you can see it in your heart VI ... just answer if this zone is actually working? Nothing has dropped except for cards .. these we got by killing the zone over and over. We dont think it is a kill based zone, but we've tried everything else we can think of including killing Bristlebane. 8-(<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a thought after I read your post about 'Not Yours' following 'My Finger'.  The names have to be part of a puzzle (as with many of the names in this zone).  I'm thinking some of them may be a brain teaser kind of like:<P>uPLATm = Platinum or 'PLAT' in 'um'  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I can't think of anything that 'Not Yours' following 'My Finger' would mean, but maybe somebody who is better at these teasers will be able to.  Another thing to note (although it is a huge stretch and probably means absolutely nothing) is that both 'My Finger' and 'Not Yours' have eight letters and a space.<P>Math The = The Aftermath<BR>I'M you = I'm bigger than you<BR>LAGN4UAGE = Foreign Language<P>We should look for things like this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ugh, I'm falling behind in everything now that I managed to bind up in PoM.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Testing all sorts of NPCs knowing the most I will lose is an experience death. I'll catch one of the three on tonight, hopefully one of the casters is on right now. <P>A few new thoughts: Donk and 86... Something is just wrong there. Don't get me wrong, I'm loving the experience (Although there are going to be disputes over these two in the future), but VI putting two NPCs together that are 50+ and 60 that hit for single digits? There just has to be something special about them. Neither respond to hails, 86 indifferent, Donk dubious. Certainly doesn't look promising, but it's something to think about.<P>*Now to catch a blue names eye.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">* If any BLUE NAMES are reading this, I feel at this point we need confirmation: Is the current entrance to PoM the intended entrance as designed? If there is a second entrance, which I'm starting to suspect, NO ONE is looking for it. People hear PoM, they think "That zone inside that buggiest and most poorly designed zone in the game? Haha, I'll never see that". If this is not the intended/only entrance to PoM, I think all the time we have spent deserves a small confirmation. <P>If this is not the only entrance, then no one will ever find the true entrance anytime soon, possibly never. If we did know there was another entrance, or there wasn't, it might put a few peoples minds at ease.<P>I'm starting to get a *few* cards, so I'll start playing around with them shortly. Have you by chance made a list of NPC's you've turned them into, Irontaail? Donk, Ricoculous, Bristlebane come to mind. But it might be worthwhile just trying the halflings in the courtyard, Kelld etc...<P>Also, have you tried training Petunia the Doll to the stage where Chuckles is when the puppets are up, or even to Bristlebane when he spawns? I tried last night, but had trouble with Ricoculous. He seemed to run fairly fast, so I couldn't worry with Petunia.<P>I'll work on getting quite a few NPCs up on the site a little bit later tonight. I'll add the maps with NPC locs after the key NPCs are up... Doing the maze has me burned out on mapping for a couple of days.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You need to hold the key on your cursor, then place the cursor over the rock and hit the 'u' key on your keyboard.  <P>Not sure if this will result in anything, but ya never know.<P>The 9am daily spawn of BB, to check for a condition in the zone, sounds right, but who knows.<P>Great work Irontail and everyone else, keep it up.

</FONT><HR>The map is an excellent map, Irontaail, but I really want to examine each area in detail. Garden have a full page map, theatre full page map etc. <P>Examining the map in more detail than I initially did, I do have to wonder... What is the area on the far right of the map? It looks like a very large area I've never seen before. And the same goes for the area past library I've mentioned far too many times now... Those are a LOT of rooms that, as far as I know, no one has a clue what is contained within them. <P>I'll get to work on the NPCs after the next Bristlebane spawns in-game. Just missed him when I logged in, and I'm curious what happens when I try to trade with him from afar. If it hasn't been tried before, I'm curious if he's Bristlebane00 or Bristlebane01... His words<BR>Bristlebane says 'Well, there is nothing to see here!  Go home everyone!' makes me wonder where home is...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Some more information... I went around trying to use a couple of the cards on everything, nada. Not on broken doors, not on NPCs, not on trees, rocks, candle holders, desks, chairs, floors... Nothing.<P>Bristlebane spawned... This is where it gets confusing. I tried the trade trick to see his name. #Bristlebane00. #Kelld00. All the halfings have # in front of their names. As some might know, some Kael giants have this as well. However, I feel there is the possibility this could mean these are secondary NPCs. <P>All the halflings *should* have a backstory that includes staying near Bristlebane, as he tells them to go home. It is possible there are other versions of all the halflings at the theatre in PoM. No other NPC in PoM has a # before their name when trying to trade from a distance.<P>Secondly, it's either a typo or a clue. For some reason I had not noticed it before, but notice the puppet of the King of Thieves is "Birstlebane's Puppet". What that means is anyones guess.<P>And I went to Lithiniath to test the #, and for some reason asked a couple more things. Bristlebane and Fizzlethorpe are keywords for the You don't want to seek him thing, so I said "I seek him". Nada, so "I seek madness". Nothing special, but I had not noticed this response anywhere:<P>[Thu Mar 01 18:48:57 2001] Lithiniath says 'uoy skees ssendam, ssendam kees ton od uoY <P>You do not seek madness, madness seeks you...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A question about your map of the chessboard, Irontaail:  On your map of the layout, you show 2 pieces named "a bishop thingy", but in your screenshot where you name them from left to right, it shows only 1 "a bishop thingy" and 2 "a random piece"'s.  Which is it?<P>Also, just a brainstorm on the "My Finger" and "Not Yours".  This came to mind when someone mentioned that "Not Yours" is smaller than "My Finger": when small children first learn what ownership is, they like to take things and say "Mine!".  Maybe this doesn't have anything to do with solving any POM quests or puzzles, but I find the analogy amusing  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> But it might be something to keep in mind...<P>Boy do I want to be power lvled so I can visit this zone!

</FONT><HR>OK, another post from someone with no exp. in PoM, just reading the board and spewing ideas.<P>There are 10 cards right? There are 10 main char classes (plus 4 hybrids). Maybe you need each holding a card with hybrids able to fill in for a parent class. I tried to come up with who would hold what but I'm not sure. Thought the rogue would be the jester, except that Melee and Priest both have 3 classes in each whereas Casters have 4...so maybe a necro is the jester, etc. Would kind of bring in the need for classes to work together/co-op. Don't know where it would go from there...chessboard?<BR>I had some other thoughts about Ferj responses having to do with the name of NPCs...like when asking if you brought what was taken, say My Finger Not Yours, etc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello...first off let me thank you guys for all the hard work you have put in one this. Its people like you that make the game easier for me (hey, its true). But I do want to chime in on this PoM thing.<P>First, I believe this is the only entrance to the zone and that it needs to be unlocked for it to function properly. Noone goes to this much trouble to make a zone not functionable (Not even VI). Also, this is a blane we are talking about..I highly doubt that the designers left an entrance open to the PoM by mistake....guys you are at the only way in.<P>Next, believing this is a puzzle, I would like a lttle mor information on the puppets, I'm starting to think they have something to do with this cause of the (nothing to see here...lets go) statement. I believe finding a way to perform may be part of unlocking this mystery.<P>Now, on to the cards. There are 10 cards and 9 numbered spawns (0,1,2,3,5,8,9,22,86). I assume one card goes to each of these spawns and the joker goes to Bristlebane. Ok which goes where. I believe 86,8,9 get one of the suits (86 backward is 89....kinda makes sense), that 1,3,5 get a suit (all prime numbers) and 22,2,0 get a suit (22 take away a 2 is 2 takeaway a 2 is 0). As to which suit to use, I am at a loss as to which card goes to who (assuming that higher card goes to higher number but who knows). After the cards are distrubuted u give  Bristlebane the joker and well...see what happens. <P>Oh well......that is my best guess so far...keep pumping info and i will keep thinking (wish I could be there).<P>Tilen <BR>39 DE SK<BR>Morell Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

On the walls of the gambling parlors are the words "KING'S COURT" with a picture of three cards, a kings crown and a mace of some sort. Considering there are three colors for each set of cards, aside from the jester... I still am not ruling the idea of actually playing King's Court in PoM, however there are no known rules for this game from any NPC.<P>And I've hailed all NPCs except those in courtyard, alice in wonderland, shakespeare, chessboard an... Donk backwards. Nada. Curious to try halflings in courtyard and alice in wonderland halflings, as well as Donk.

</FONT><HR>Has anyone tried Anti-killing one of the NPCs. you know Heal and heal and heal?<P>Also the card numbers: 9 86 looks like 986 as in 986 studios the company that used to be in the logo. the rest kinda looks like a fibbanachi sequence. But its not. 1,1,3,5,8,13,21 <BR>the 0 should be a 1 and the 12 should be a 13, the 22 changes to a 21, and the 9,86 are removed.<P>If someone's going to start hailing or shouting try "Fibbanachi" <BR>hehe<P>Also there is a quest tool that verant has Only used for one other quest that might be in use for these NPCs.  Refer to the Blurred map quest in Quenos.    Basicaly if you get the map from the zombie, then stick around till the zombie spawns again with the map, it will give u a different speech. SO..... Start bringing and filling your bags with every conceivable item that has no apparent use.  Maybe some NPC realy doesn't like "Whore's bane" or something and will give u a little speach about it. <BR>Any one try Laughing at a NPC? hehe<BR>-Tsuul "Will never get there if you don't"<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>0,1,2,3,5,8,9,22,86<P>Actually (on the number theory bit) the only prime numbers in this sequence are 2, 3 and 5. That leaves 0,1,8,9,22 and 86.  Now, I don't know if they have a math buff down at Verant but even if they did this sequence would probably not be a major quest component.  Most math enthusiasts have very little respect for layman's math skills and rightfully so.<P>So, what else can we say about them?  <BR>22 is standard in things like busting in blackjack and phrases like 'catch 22' (damned if you do and damned if you don't)<P>86 is old service industry rhyming slang (nixed and eighty-sixed) and is used in bars and restaurants sometimes to mean 'out of something'.  So, someone might say: "We are 86ing Bud until we get the delivery tomorrow".<P>The total sequence, excluding 86, adds to 50.  This was the old level cap but wt heck can that mean?  You can't seem to interact with these numbered fellows anyways so how do you explore the options?<P>Sorry, I'm quite stumped on this part and I am normally ok with number games.  One can almost get a few progressions to work but I can't figure anything in there.  Perhaps I'll toss it at one of the math profs and see if anything catches their eyes.  I still feel like this is not the problem though,  we need to find the tricks not the puzzles per se.<P>/salute and keep at it.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063380&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063380&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
